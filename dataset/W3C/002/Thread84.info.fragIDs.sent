<s> I've downloaded HTML-Tidy released on 8th July 2000 from http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/. I've used a previous version (14th April 1999) and all features were working fine.  </s>
<s> The new one doesn't output the errors to file with the option -f filename .  </s>
<s> If i write the option before the foo.htm, TIDY opens the DOS window, parses the sourse, detects errors, does changes (if -m is active), close the DOS windows and creates a text-file BUT EMPTY even if the htm contains errors.  </s>
<s> If i write the option after the foo.htm, TIDY does the same as above, including the EMPTY text-file, with the difference that the DOS window remains open, showing the end of processed file, with the usual recomandations.  </s>
<s> I use Windows95, but i don't think it matters since the old version of TIDY is working well.  </s>
<s> I keep TIDY versions in different directories and run them with complete path, starting with drive letter.  </s>
<s> Where lies the problem?  </s>
<s> My best wishes.  </s>

<s> As reported by several other people, and confirmed by myself, this is a bug introduced into the 8 Jul 00 version of Tidy.  </s>
<s> Fortunately, if you have the source code, the fix is quite simple : tidy.c,  </s>
<s> Line 898 : if (input != null) this should be : if (fp != null) Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> I downloaded the source code for the 8th july version, made the change on line 898, compiled and linked to a new version of tidy.exe but still there is no output to error file.  </s>
<s> So, there should be something wrong somewhere else.  </s>

<s> Sorry, I don't what to tell you - that specific fix solved the problem for me on Mac OS.  </s>
<s> Since Dave rewrote that whole piece of code, using "input" and "fp" differently than previously, maybe there is another bug lurking, that affects your platform.  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> I get the same under OS/2 warp 3. If you are not into recompiling source code, you can redirect Tidy's error messages to a file, by adding: 2 error.txt  </s>
<s> at the command line.  </s>
<s> Your command line would then look something like this: tidy -config tidy.cfg input.htm 1 output.htm 2 error.txt.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Eddie.  </s>
<s> I will post a new release to fix this, either later today or sometime tomorow.  </s>
