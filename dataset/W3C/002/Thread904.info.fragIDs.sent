Dear all, 
I am using the latest version of Tidy to tidy a HTML page: http://www.bookpool.com/.x/np66ice556/fi. 
After that, I find that the end FORM tag for "simple search" is missing. 
I am wondering if somebody can help me out. 
I would appreciate it so much.

Did you use the 04 August 2000 release? 
Hello Hai, Assuming you have a recent version of Tidy, the basic problem is that the page is mixing form and table elements in unsafe ways. 
It is not unusual for inexperienced web developers to do this kind of thing, however. 
If you cannot update the page, try the --force-output option to force Tidy to do the best it can. 
There are no guarantees that the results will be what you want. 
It may or may not be better than the original. 
I tried your example, and Tidy seems to do OK with it. 
If you can update the page, move the form and /form tags to just before and just after the the table and /table tags, respectively. 
E.g. td Label td Label If you need several forms within a single layout table, use nested tables and put the entire form within a single cell. 
If necessary, you can merge cells in the outer table using rowspan and colspan. 
take it easy, Charlie P.S. This is one for the FAQ 
Oops. 
Not sure what JTidy will do with forms and tables. 
I believe it is consistent with 04Aug2000 version of C Tidy. 
I believe, also, that it does not support the --force-output option. 
However, it shouldn't be difficult to modify JTidy to generate output even if errors are present. 
Can any JTidy users advise Hai? take it easy, Charlie
