how come that tens of html tidy come to my mail box? 
I'm fed up. 
Please what do you suggest Thanks 
I am not the list owner, but I think what you need to do is send an e-mail to: html-tidy-request@w3.org html-tidy-request@w3.org with unsubscribe in the subject field. 
At least that is what it looks like. 
Good luck with it.

Follow the instructions on http://www.w3.org/Mail/Request , i.e., write a mail to html-tidy-request@w3.org with "unsubscribe" in the subject line.
