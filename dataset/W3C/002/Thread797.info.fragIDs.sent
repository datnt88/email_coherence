<s> Hello, I'm trying to convert some HTML files to XML and then process them with XSLT.  </s>
<s> However, these HTML files have proprietary tags in the head section which Tidy strips out.  </s>
<s> I've been looking at the jTidy source to see if there's any obvious way to get these tags to pass through.  </s>
<s> One thought is to extend the custom tag configuration so the specified tags can also exist in the head section.  </s>
<s> If anyone has any suggestions on how I can approach this problem, I'd appreciate the advice.  </s>

<s> Hi, Did you ever get an answer to this?  </s>
<s> I'm hitting exactly the same problem.  </s>
<s> It is possible to specify new tags, but I have not found a way to say 'all elements are OK'.  </s>
<s> So far my workaround is to do a regex scan for non-html tags, then add those to the command line.  </s>
