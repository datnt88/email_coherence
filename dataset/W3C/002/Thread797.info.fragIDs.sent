Hello, I'm trying to convert some HTML files to XML and then process them with XSLT. 
However, these HTML files have proprietary tags in the head section which Tidy strips out. 
I've been looking at the jTidy source to see if there's any obvious way to get these tags to pass through. 
One thought is to extend the custom tag configuration so the specified tags can also exist in the head section. 
If anyone has any suggestions on how I can approach this problem, I'd appreciate the advice. 
Thanks, -Bill 
Hi all - I'm trying to convert a HTML file to XML and ... I don't seam able to do it ! 
The command line looks like this : tidy -f errs1 --output-xml true foo.html  output What am I doing wrong ?!?! Thanks for your help - Carmen 
Hi, Did you ever get an answer to this? 
I'm hitting exactly the same problem. 
It is possible to specify new tags, but I have not found a way to say 'all elements are OK'. 
So far my workaround is to do a regex scan for non-html tags, then add those to the command line.
