Attached patches should do it, please encorporate in next release. 
Sorry, no patch for HTML stylesheets or other schemas, should be obvious.

/ ht@inf.ed.ac.uk (Henry S. Thompson) was heard to say: 
Done. Note: the XHTML stylesheet is machine generated from the HTML one. 
I encourage you to make patches in the HTML one and regenerate the XHTML. 
But for a patch this small, it doesn't really matter. 
Likewise, the DTD is the normative form today, so that's the right place to do the patches. 
Checking them into CVS today...
