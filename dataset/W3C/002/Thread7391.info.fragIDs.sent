<s> John, I am not sure if RDF is dying.  </s>
<s> If it is, then DCD (Document Content Description) submitted by Microsoft and IBM will also be dead because it is based on RDF.  </s>
<s> DCD is supposed to be the replacement for DTDs, but in XML/RDF syntax.  </s>
<s> Those who who may have expressed the view that W3C could be abandoning RDF are sorely mistaken.  </s>
<s> The RDF Model and Syntax Working Group continues to refine its specification based on comments on the most recent public working draft (dated 19 August).  </s>

<s> We hope to declare a 'Last Call' review for the RDF Model and Syntax specification in a single-digit number of days and for the RDF Schema specification shortly thereafter.  </s>

<s> I volunteered to come up with a DTD for the history property.  </s>
<s> I will look at RDF, and if it seems like a convenient way to express what we want, we should consider using it, even if we don't advertise it as being RDF compliant.  </s>
<s> In other words, there's no reason to invent something new for its own sake.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it is not clear that RDF adds a lot either.  </s>
<s> Sometimes using a generic mechanism for meta-data obscures the instance you're trying to capture and just adds complexity.  </s>
<s> This isn't the spirit of XML where one is supposed to be able to define document types that closely correspond to the application being modeled.  </s>
