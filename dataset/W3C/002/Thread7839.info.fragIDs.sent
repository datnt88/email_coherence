<s> While implementing OPTIONS and PUT (with LOCKS) a few things need to be specified in 2518.  </s>
<s> The problem is handling requests to resources that don't exist.  </s>
<s> The following are some use-cases:  </s>
<s> 1) /foo is a directory with no contents.  </s>
<s> OPTIONS to /foo returns a 200 with the appropriate headers OPTIONS to /foo/bar returns?? 200 or 404?? OPTIONS to /foo/bar/fee returns a 404 2) /foo is a directory with no contents and is locked depth infinity PUT to /foo/bar, does this require a tagged list for the lock token  </s>
<s> specifying /foo or will un untagged list work as well.  </s>
<s> Yes I have raised number 2 before.  </s>
<s> I think the key here is whether or not a "null resource" is considered an entity on the server or not.  </s>
<s> Since OPTIONS  </s>
<s> in 2068 states "the OPTIONS request applies only to the options that are available when communicating with that resource."  </s>
<s> Thus to get a 200 response a resource must exist!!!  </s>
<s> Is the intent of 2518 to create "lock null resources" AND "null resources"  </s>
<s> where the "null resource" is defined as a resource that does not exist but  </s>
<s> the parent does????  </s>
<s> Thus OPTIONS and LOCKS work differently than if a "null resource" is not a real resource and thus simply returns 404 to Webdav requests.  </s>

<s> Well, let's see.  </s>
<s> Consider PUT, for example; obviously, you can PUT to a  </s>
<s> resource which does not exist (in the sense that GET would return 404).  </s>
<s> Therefore, it is useful for OPTIONS to be able to tell you that PUT is allowed on that resource.  </s>
<s> tries stuff ...OK, let's see.  </s>
<s> Running against Apache, if I do OPTIONS against a non-existent resource (in a non-existent directory), I get a 200, with the expected data.  </s>
<s> GET against the same resource returns 404; SMURF against that resource returns 405.  </s>
<s> To me, this seems reasonable.  </s>
<s> I believe that *all* resources exist.  </s>
<s> A resource is an object whose methods are HTTP methods; you can issue an HTTP method against any Request-URI in the server's namespace; the server will respond.  </s>
<s> By definition, the response is the result of that object's method.  </s>
<s> Therefore, there is an object named by that Request-URI.  </s>
<s> Note that 2616, section 10.4.5, defines 404 as meaning, "The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI".  </s>
<s> This is *not* the same as saying that the specified resource does not exist.  </s>

<s> Does anyone have a client that depends on individual resource (including  </s>

<s> Does anyone have a client that has *any* expectations for what the OPTIONS method returns that might be URI specific or that alternately assumes that what is true for one resource is true for some others?  </s>

<s> The versioning draft specifies extremely case-by-case response to OPTIONS.  </s>
<s> I think the OPTIONS response in DeltaV can even vary depending on the state of a resource at one point in time vs. another.  </s>
<s> E.g. if a resource can be turned into a "version-controlled resource", then OPTIONS should show the VERSION-CONTROL method, to indicate that it can be converted.  </s>
<s> Obviously that kind of design presupposes that OPTIONS depends on precisely what resource is named in the URL.  </s>

<s> mod_dav returns different values for the OPTIONS request based on the resource identified.  </s>
<s> (so no, I won't be "unduly burdened" :-) I don't envision changing that, as I believe the "OPTIONS means server options" concept (as stated before on the DeltaV list) is bogus.  </s>
<s> OPTIONS is sent to a particular resource.  </s>
<s> Use OPTIONS * to get server information.  </s>

<s> I don't want to know if the server has SVN capabilities; I want to know if *that* resource is under SVN control.  </s>
<s> It is silly to take any other position.  </s>
<s> Just go read S9.2 of RFC 2616: "... request for information ... on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI." and "If the Request-URI is not an asterisk, ... applies only ... when communicating with that resource."  </s>

<s> I concur -- it's pretty clear that OPTIONS in HTTP/1.1 is per-resource, unless the Request-URI is "*".  </s>
<s> It's fairly typical for Web servers to have different capabilities in different parts of their namespace.  </s>
<s> Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that a server must perform a query for each OPTIONS request -- you could, for example, have OPTIONS code that handles a portion of the namespace.  </s>
<s> DeltaV could also add some constraints as well, such as, if you support VERSION-CONTROL at one level of a namespace hierarchy, all sub-collections also must support VERSION-CONTROL.  </s>
<s> So, this would allow clients to avoid sending some kinds of OPTIONS requests, if efficiency is a concern.  </s>

<s> It's fairly typical for Web servers to have different capabilities in different parts of their namespace.  </s>
<s> So do we want 2518 to say anything or leave this for HTTP/1.1?  </s>
<s> It sounds to me that all the questions asked here about OPTIONS in the last two weeks are probably best left to the HTTP/1.1 spec.  </s>
<s> (I just wish that spec said more.) J.  </s>
<s> I do not think the HTTP spec says enough, and for OPTIONS to be useful to clients, I think we need to specify what the behavior is.  </s>
<s> It's useful to look at a few use cases and discuss what the server should respond.  </s>
<s> Take for instance: /foo is an empty directory OPTIONS /foo Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, PROPFIND, COPY, SEARCH If the /foo is writeable add PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK OPTIONS /foo/bar Allow: OPTIONS If /foo is writeable add MKCOL, PUT, LOCK OPTIONS /foo/bar/fee Allow: OPTIONS This is one way of handling the OPTIONS, I can think of other permutations that might make sense.  </s>
<s> Again for this to be truly useful information to a client, I believe we need to state what a server should respond with to a client in each case.  </s>
