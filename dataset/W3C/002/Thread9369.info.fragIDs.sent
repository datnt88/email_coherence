<s> [I missed this when it was raised] I like this proposal, as it makes much more intuitive sense to me, and leverages existing developer understanding of toString() in existing programming languages.  </s>
<s> Assuming it's consistent with any decisions about datatyping, I think there would be value to our current charter in adopting this.  </s>
<s> To deal with backward compatibility, I'd suggest that rdf:value be retained as a "deprecated" form, equivalent to rdf:toString, which becomes the preferred form.  </s>
<s> Thus, my vote is AGAINST deciding to defer this issue to a new WG at this time.  </s>
<s> I think the proposal should be accepted or rejected by this WG.  </s>
<s> I think deferring this issue would effectively be equivalent to accepting and fixing the status quo; i.e. URI formation by concatenation.  </s>

<s> OK OK. (I think it's fine that the syntax cannot represent any graph; if such a syntax is required, I think it's clearly an issue for a future WG.) #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>

<s> If it is being considered, then I vote to REJECT it, for reasons that I hope will become clear when I get the MT datatyping document finished.  </s>
<s> (Basically, the appropriate interpretation of rdf:value in the new MT is that it is simply identity, and the 'toString' name is then actively misleading.  </s>
<s> This view of the meaning of rdf:value has built into it a view about datatyping that I want to argue against, basically one which assumes that all literals occurrences are strings.  </s>
<s> I think that it only makes intuitive sense if one agrees to read all literals as referring to themselves, which, I will argue, embodies a use/mention confusion which is neither semantically  </s>

<s> So I propose that: We reject this suggestion as an unnecessary change ACTION the model theory editor (Pat) to explain what rdf:value means ACTION the primer editor (Eric) to ensure that a description of how to use rdf:value is included.  </s>

<s> Yes. Datatyping and rdf:value are still subject of discussion.  </s>
<s> I'd reword the first ACTION as: to propose an interpretation of rdf:value for discussion by WG (to my knowledge, Pat is working on it already).  </s>
