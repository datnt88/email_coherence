<s> The definition of dead properties is not clear enough to make that proposal  </s>
<s> a basis for interoperability.  </s>
<s> Since I love examples, follow me through this one:  </s>
<s> - A WebDAV client software package defines a couple dead properties,  </s>
<s> "image-height" and "image-width" as integers.  </s>
<s> It sets these properties on  </s>
<s> all images it saves &amp; uses them later.  </s>
<s> Obviously so far it's a dead property.  </s>
<s> - Other clients start to use these.  </s>
<s> Still dead, right?  </s>
<s> - Custom software is added onto another WebDAV server platform to set these  </s>
<s> properties auto-magically whenever an image is uploaded.  </s>
<s> The base server software is uninvolved in this process.  </s>
<s> - A full WebDAV server decides to make sure that whenever these properties are set, at least they're integers.  </s>
<s> Maybe it also checks they're not negative.  </s>
<s> Other servers, however, still ignore these properties.  </s>
<s> - Another DAV server decides that it can calculate this property on the fly and make sure it's always correct.  </s>
<s> However, the calculation is expensive (Note that this scenario starts to sound like justification for NOT including properties in allprop).  </s>
<s> When do these properties stop being dead and start being live?  </s>
<s> Can clients  </s>
<s> rely on these properties being listed in 'allprop' or not?  </s>
<s> On some servers but not on others?  </s>
<s> Ugh.  </s>
<s> That's why I think only a fixed list of properties can be relied upon to be in allprop.  </s>
<s> Let's rely on 'propname' to actually tell us the complete list of properties, whether they're alive, dead, or somewhere in between.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> The nice thing about allprop is that you get all the dead properties.  </s>
<s> The bad thing about allprop is that you cannot see if a resource is versioned/version or which methods it does support.  </s>

<s> I think Geoff's suggestion (DAV live props and all dead ones) is a good guideline for servers, both because these properties are presumably cheap and because an existing client who just set a dead property is likely to be very surprised when ALLPROP doesn't return it.  </s>
<s> I suggested adding "at least" because I think that gives servers the proper control over just how interoperable they want to be with old clients.  </s>

<s> Probably the place you and I really agree is that we'd both rather see ALLPROP go away entirely :^).  </s>

<s> It's clear new clients must not expect allprop to mean all properties, but we also agree that old clients must be able to operate.  </s>
<s> However if we can't  </s>

<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> This works fine for me if we allow for server "discretion" by saying  </s>
<s> "at least all live properties defined in RFC 2518 plus all dead  </s>

<s> be prohibited from doing so.  </s>
<s> My motivation for this (other than common sense :^) is that I believe many generic clients use ALLPROP as a way of saying "show me everything I'm likely to care about."  </s>
<s> Some servers will have a number of general-interest properties that are live and useful in such a list; for example, workflow servers often have live properties indicating status, assignee, and those kinds of things.  </s>
<s> It would be awkward if 2518++ prohibited them from showing these in response to an ALLPROP.  </s>

<s> I follow your motivation but not your conclusion.  </s>
<s> Let's stick  </s>
<s> to the workflow properties (workprops) example:  </s>
<s> A generic client will survive workprops returned from an allprop, sure.  </s>
<s> But will it be able to do anything with it?  </s>
<s> Most likely not.  </s>
<s> A workflow client will need the workprops returned from the server.  </s>
<s> Now there are four possible cases: 1) the client does not use allprop but prop ...list... /prop 2) the client uses allprop and the server returns the workprops with allprop, even though they are live properties.  </s>
<s> 3) the client uses allprop and the server does not return the workprops, because the server does not know these properties.  </s>
<s> 4) the client uses allprop and the server does not return the workprops.  </s>
<s> The server implements the workprops, but it does not return those on allprop.  </s>
<s> 1) does not need your allprop "at least" extension, 2) works as you intended, 3) is working, although the client cannot distinguish it from 4), and 4) is not working.  </s>
<s> What would fix your situtation is implementing our include proposal.  </s>
<s> The server would then know when to return the workprops, and a client knows that the server does not implement workprops if they are not returned.  </s>
<s> //Stefan  </s>
<s> However, supported-live-property-set is not part of RFC2518.  </s>
<s> Therefore,  </s>
<s> regular DAV clients cannot rely on knowing what properties are live and what  </s>
<s> properties are dead on any given server.  </s>
<s> Therefore, regular DAV clients cannot rely on knowing what properties they will get back on an 'allprop' request if 'allprop' is defined as returning 2518&amp;dead properties.  </s>
<s> I think it's simpler to not use allprop at all.  </s>
<s> Since so few properties may be returned by allprop, and all by propname, why not just use propname &amp; then a specific query?  </s>
<s> I'd want to see a rather compelling reason before inventing new syntax when existing PROPFIND syntaxes, without allprop, suffice.  </s>
<s> lisa  </s>
<s> Allowing a server to return a server-defined set of live properties with an ALLPROP is fine with me.  </s>
<s> I also agree that this should be coupled with a deprecation of the use of ALLPROP by generic clients.  </s>
<s> This allows a server to chose how "interoperable" it wants to be with existing clients that use ALLPROP, without forcing it to do anything egregiously inefficient (the 2518 properties and dead properties are reasonable to require, because it is extremely unlikely that they will be very expensive to compute).  </s>
