Joseph, 
could you please add IAIK to the interop matrix in [1]: IAIK's impl. 
can sucessfully verify the examples of Christian Geuer-Pollmann. 
BTW: Why is the Application feature in the table labelled "base64 encoding"? 
I cannot see such a feature in the XPath Filter 2.0 spec. 
Regards, Gregor [1] http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/05/xmldsig-filter2-interop.html 
Added to [1]. 
Ok, changed to "xpath-filter2". 
Does anyone thinks it's useful to break out different features such as intersect, subtract, union? 
Anything else? 
I don't think this is that useful for reporting, though we need to make sure all of these things are in our test set.

Breaking up into the different features make no sense. 
BTW, on the interop page, please change "Y1: geuerp-xfilter2-01.zip: the two examples from the Signature. 
" to "Y1: geuerp-xfilter2-01.zip: the two examples from the specification. 
" Regards, Christian 
We're Y1 too[1]. 
Also, attached is another interop sample; John Boyer's XFDL document. 
This is a slight tweak of that from [1].

No, I do not think that such a split into particular subfeatures makes sense. 
The moment we have solved the problem with empty node sets I explained recently (could anybody of the spec editors please comment!), 
I could contribute some examples dealing with empty input node sets and empty XPath processing results.
