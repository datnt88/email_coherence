<s> Greetings, I have an action item to post some logistical information about the next f2f meeting hosted by Grainger here in Chicago.  </s>
<s> Here is this info: Location of meeting: 100 Grainger Parkway Lake Forest, Illinois 60045 We'll provide a final location for the meeting room as we move forward.  </s>
<s> Grainger has obtained a greatly reduced rate for WS-Choreography members at Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn 100 Barclay Blvd Lincolnshire, IL 60069 The Grainger rate is $105/night.  </s>
<s> Please mention "W3C" and "Grainger" when arranging reservations.  </s>
<s> This hotel is literally brand-new; it will open on June 1st.  </s>
<s> It's literally right across the street from the office in which I work and appears quite nice!  </s>
<s> There are also many other hotels in the neighborhood, there at least 4 within a 1-mile radius.  </s>
<s> There are two Marriotts and several others, search for the 60069 zip code.  </s>
