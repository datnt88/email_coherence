If you have not already made your arrangements for lodging for the WebDAV meeting here's some information I gathered that may be helpful. 
The listing of hotels in the Microsoft page seems accurate except that some hotels have changed their names. 
The hotel prices range from $99 to $225 a night. 
I personally prefer to stay at bed and breakfast inns. 
They are often more comfortable, less anonymous (which can be good or bad) usually have great breakfasts, and are often cheaper too. 
Here's the phones of six in the area. 
None are known to me. 
(Each B&amp;B is different, whereas hotels are consistent, but I have never been disappointed.) 
For what it's worth, I know the Cascade B&amp;B is sold out for the nights of June 15 and 16. 
I also know it's cheaper ($75/night) than the cheapest hotel I called (Best Western, at $99) and even cheaper when you consider it includes breakfast. 
I hope this information is useful but I provide it with no warrantee expressed or implied. 
it would be great if Microsoft could add it to their Web page.

Jim, Thank you for this information! 
I've added it to the lodging information page for the Redmond meeting, available off of: I believe that all phone numbers in Redmond, Bellevue, and Kirkland are now 425 area code, rather than 206 area code.
