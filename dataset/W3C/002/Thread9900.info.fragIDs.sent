<s> Well, I appear to agree with Sergey and disagree with Patrick, ... ... at least about the topic of disagreement!  </s>
<s> I think RDF graphs are fundamentally untidy.  </s>
<s> The serious concerns I have with S are as follows: 1. Tidiness.  </s>
<s> Different occurrences of the same string have different types, and IMO are better modelled as distinct entities.  </s>
<s> S does not allow for this.  </s>
<s> This is not asserting that implementations may not use string interning or equivalent techniques for storage compression, merely that the semantics of a literal node depend on context.  </s>
<s> 2. Idiom B. Idiom B, where the lexical form of a datatype is used directly in a single triple, is for me, the primary idiom of RDF M&amp;S.  </s>
<s> For me, articulating implicit typing within that idiom is the goal of the datatyping work.  </s>
<s> S's articulation of idiom B is deficient.  </s>
<s> 2A: Unfortunately in S, idiom B is explicitly a sop to backward compatability which does not interwork properly with the preferred S idiom, idiom A. The examples we have already seen have been Jenny ageA _:a .  </s>
<s> _:a xsd:integer.map  </s>
<s> "4" .  </s>
<s> Jenny ageB "4" .  </s>
<s> ageA rdfs:range xsd:integer.val .  </s>
<s> ageB rdfs:range xsd:integer.lex .  </s>
<s> The single conceptual property of age gets reflected differently in the two idioms, and the value of the age property is an integer in one, and a string in the other.  </s>
<s> I think idiom B is *the* idiom of choice, and datatyping should explicate how one gets from the string lexicalization to the intended value.  </s>
<s> 2B: Monotonicity and the open world assumption on type information.  </s>
<s> S (idiom B and P) is non-monotonic with respect to type information, or at least forces the RDF application to behave as if the underlying theory were non-monotonic.  </s>
<s> [Sorry this is rather obscure, I will ask for a clarification about S-P, which will illustrate my concerns]  </s>
<s> That's it.  </s>
<s> Other areas of difference are I think open to compromise.  </s>
<s> So just as Sergey could live with one uri for each type (as in TDL), I could live with S's three or four.  </s>
<s> While I think the D syntactic idiom is better than S-A from a backward compatibility viewpoint, and I do not like S idiom A, I could live with S-A being the recommended local idiom.  </s>
<s> I also have doubts about the implementability of S, and will seek clarifications from Sergey.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I agree ;-) Patrick  </s>
<s> In S-P as I understand it rdf:value is understood in relation to the known datatypes: In other words, rdf:value "extracts" the lexical representation from a given pair: EXT(I(rdf:value)) := {  x,y , y | x,y is an element of a datatype mapping} (Notice that for the above definition to be well-formed, we need to be able to enumerate all datatype mappings.  </s>
<s> This can be done using special vocabulary e.g., xsd:date.map  </s>
<s> rdfs:subClassOf rdfdt:DatatypeMapping).  </s>
<s> So for example, in a minimal RDF implementation in which we only have strings rdf:value is a 1-1 mapping.  </s>
<s> Thus in that sort of implementation we would have: _:a foo _:b .  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:value "string" .  </s>
<s> _:c bar _:d .  </s>
<s> _:d rdf:value "string" .  </s>
<s> implies _:a foo _:b .  </s>
<s> _:c bar _:b .  </s>
<s> (in the premise both _:b and _:d are  "string", "string"  ) If a second RDF implementation has a greater range of datatypes then it may be the case that "string" can map to something else.  </s>
<s> In this case the implication above does not hold.  </s>
<s> e.g. if we support xsd:string and xsd:integer then we have the following: _:a foo _:b .  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:value "1000" .  </s>
<s> _:c bar _:d .  </s>
<s> _:d rdf:value "1000" .  </s>
<s> does not imply _:a foo _:b .  </s>
<s> _:c bar _:b .  </s>
<s> I believe the semantic web will be built on the systematic application of the open world assumption.  </s>
<s> S-P requires a closed world assumption on datatypes, that results in defeasible implication, and hence non-interoperability.  </s>
<s> This is a significant concern.  </s>
<s> Similarly S-B seems to require applications to make similar defeasible typing above the RDF layer.  </s>
<s> Without any type information a string should be treated as a string.  </s>
<s> In the light of a single range constraint the application should treat the string in accordance with that datatype.  </s>
<s> If multiple range constraints apply to the same lexical node then it is unclear what an application should do.  </s>
<s> So S-B also suffers non-monoticity but in the application layer.  </s>
