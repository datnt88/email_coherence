<s> Hello John, I was just looking through the Canonical XML Recommendation at in the XPaths that it uses to describe which nodes are collected within the document.  </s>
<s> Both the paths start with: which is not a valid path.  </s>
<s> I believe it is intended to be: //node() Cheers,  </s>

<s> Hi Jenni,  </s>
<s> Thanks for the note, but I don't understand why you claim that //. is illegal.  </s>
<s> From the XPath spec: Expr - ... - LocationPath - AbsoluteLocationPath - AbbreviatedAbsoluteLocationPath - '//' RelativeLocationPath - '//' Step - '//' AbbreviatedStep - '//.' Clearly it is legal according the BNF rules in the XPath specification.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you have an implementation of XPath that contains an error?  </s>

<s> Hi John,  </s>
<s> Cripes, you're right.  </s>
<s> I apologise.  </s>
<s> I'd never seen that construction used before because it's meaningless except, I guess, in this case.  </s>
<s> When you write it out in full you can see why: /descendant-or-self::node()/self::node() is equivalent to: /descendant-or-self::node() Sorry for my error, Jeni Jeni Tennison  </s>
<s> BTW, I certainly don't mind seeing the more esoteric XPath questions come up (like Jeni's or my one of some weeks back).  </s>
<s> Jeni, just so you know, John B. is laps ahead of the majority of us when it comes to understanding the intricacies of XPath.  </s>
<s> And since a solid understanding of XPath is very beneficial to making the most of XML Signature, it is good to see these questions posed on the list.  </s>
