<s> Congratulations and thanks to everyone that has contributed to these specifications!  </s>
<s> Next steps?  </s>
<s> See if we can get one more interop report on the XPath Filter2, publish it as a Proposed Recommendation in August, and a Recommendation soon afterwards.  </s>
<s> Canonical XML [XML-C14N] specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the "xml:" namespace.  </s>
<s> However, some applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from a canonicalized subdocument.  </s>
<s> For example, one might require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will and/or inserted into a different context.  </s>
<s> This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.  </s>
<s> XML Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for specifying information content to be digitally signed and for representing the resulting digital signatures in XML.  </s>
<s> Some applications require the ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information content to be signed.  </s>
<s> The XML Signature specification meets this requirement with the XPath transform.  </s>
<s> However, this transform can be difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies.  </s>
<s> This specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the development of efficient document subsetting implementations that interoperate under similar performance profiles.  </s>

<s> Does anyone here have comments on the UDDI C14N spec?  </s>
<s> in particular, section 1.1 comments on the limitations of the current standards.  </s>
<s> /r$  </s>
<s> Canonicalization can be hard even when things are simple, as in LISP or ASN.1 encoding.  </s>
<s> With XML, it is very hard and different applications can easily need different canonicalizations.  </s>
<s> It may be that the current W3C XML Canonicalizations have not bee fully adapted to Schema and to the sort of application they are talking about, where messages are shredded to their data elements, stored in a database, and those data element are later retrieved and used to reconsitute messages.  </s>
<s> I've writte code that does just that sort of thing for ASN.1 SET messages so I know what they are talking about.  </s>
<s> However, the reasons from not canonicalization namespaces prefixes are explained in Canonical XML.  </s>
<s> If you are talking about an application which will NEVER encouter those problems, then it would be nicer to canonicalize prefixes.  </s>
<s> But a growing number of W3C Recommendations encourage absolute prefix names inside attribute and element values and the use of such Recommmendations in messages signed with canonicalized prefixes will be insecure.  </s>
<s> (Actually, it can be made secure for a restricted subset of messages that use only such Recommendations as are explicitly understood by and provided for in the Canonicalization but will be insecure as soon as a new such Recommendation comes along or the application itself makes use of prefixes embedded in data that the Canonicalization does not explicitly understand.) There point about "just an attribute node" might be due a warning but there is no reason people should not be able to sign so as to omit namespace declarations if they want.  </s>
<s> There are lots of ways you can do something where you either shoot yourself in the foot or get the exact (perahps unusual) effect you want, depending on your application.  </s>
<s> Whether the things they have to say about the W3C Canonicalizations are "limitations" or "necessities" depends on your application.  </s>
