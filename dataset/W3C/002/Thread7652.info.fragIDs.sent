<s> This may be an issue that has scope beyond WebDAV, however the problems we are having are WebDAV related.  </s>
<s> Also I believe this is an issue that is more important to WebDAV then it is to the http protocol in general.  </s>
<s> We need to have the ability to expire passwords to force users to change passwords.  </s>
<s> When a users password is expired they are given a number of grace logins.  </s>
<s> For normal http access, when a user on grace logins the web server can redirect them to a page that allows them to change their password.  </s>
<s> However, when using WebDAV clients (in particular web folders, and Office 2000) the redirect to a page to change passwords does not work.  </s>
<s> Given that a WebDAV client may not be a browser and therefore may not know how to display html there needs to be another solution for expired passwords.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that this could be something the WebDAV group could address.  </s>
<s> Maybe an addition to WebDAV that allows for notification that the users account needs to be updated (password changed) and a method of changing updating user account information.  </s>
<s> IMO, changing passwords is out-of-scope of WebDAV.  </s>
<s> There are too many  </s>
<s> authentication systems and mechanisms out there, with too many variant requirements for changing passwords.  </s>
<s> While it would certainly be possible to create an HTTP-based protocol for changing passwords, that seems to be an issue between the client and the authentication system (which is probably separate from the web server).  </s>
<s> YMMV Cheers, -g  </s>

<s> Hmm, well I can see how this is an important deployment issue.  </s>
<s> I think the problem of notifying the user that their password has expired would be easier than providing a password modification protocol.  </s>
<s> It seems to be this problem isn't inherent to authoring -- regular Web access could run into this problem as well.  </s>
<s> For example, if my subscription to an online magazine, or digital library runs out, I might want to receive a message as well.  </s>
<s> But, authoring certainly does bring in clients that do not have HTML rendering capability.  </s>
<s> I think the best way to address this would be for someone to volunteer to write up an Internet Draft describing a new status code, and its meaning, to cover the password expiration, and password refresh cases.  </s>
<s> I think it should scrupulously avoid functionality that would allow a user to reset their password, unless it involved returning the URL of a Web page that would allow the password to be reset.  </s>
<s> But, this wouldn't affect existing WebDAV clients fast enough to affect your current situation -- for that, one option is to use email as a notification service, telling users their passwords have expired.  </s>

<s> We a currently working on this issue with a large customer.  </s>
<s> With a normal HTTP client (one that renders html) it is possible to solve the expired password problem.  </s>
<s> However, with WebDAV clients there currently is no way to solve this problem.  </s>
<s> This is currently THE issue that is preventing the adoption of WebDAV for this customer.  </s>
<s> If we want to have people use the WebDAV protocol we have to be willing to solve problems like this one.  </s>
