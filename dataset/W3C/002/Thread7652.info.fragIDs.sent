This may be an issue that has scope beyond WebDAV, however the problems we are having are WebDAV related. 
Also I believe this is an issue that is more important to WebDAV then it is to the http protocol in general. 
We need to have the ability to expire passwords to force users to change passwords. 
When a users password is expired they are given a number of grace logins. 
For normal http access, when a user on grace logins the web server can redirect them to a page that allows them to change their password. 
However, when using WebDAV clients (in particular web folders, and Office 2000) the redirect to a page to change passwords does not work. 
Given that a WebDAV client may not be a browser and therefore may not know how to display html there needs to be another solution for expired passwords. 
It seems to me that this could be something the WebDAV group could address. 
Maybe an addition to WebDAV that allows for notification that the users account needs to be updated (password changed) and a method of changing updating user account information. 
IMO, changing passwords is out-of-scope of WebDAV. 
There are too many 
authentication systems and mechanisms out there, with too many variant requirements for changing passwords. 
While it would certainly be possible to create an HTTP-based protocol for changing passwords, that seems to be an issue between the client and the authentication system (which is probably separate from the web server).

Changing passwords may be out-of-scope but providing a return code mechanism for revoking credentials, or to inform the user that their password/temporary password must be renewed is not. 
About a year and a half ago I made a suggestion to the HTTP-WG that we add a return code or set of return codes to do just that. 
Provide a mechanism to the underlying authentication and authorization systems that allows the system to notify it's users in a standardized manner that something needs to be addressed. 
The suggestion was tabled due to the timing and where 1.1 was in the loop. 
As Dan points out most of the new clients that are interfacing with a WebDAV server are not browsers so they are incapable of displaying HTML pages. 
So what do we put into the protocol to allow such interoperability?

Hmm, well I can see how this is an important deployment issue. 
I think the problem of notifying the user that their password has expired would be easier than providing a password modification protocol. 
It seems to be this problem isn't inherent to authoring -- regular Web access could run into this problem as well. 
For example, if my subscription to an online magazine, or digital library runs out, I might want to receive a message as well. 
But, authoring certainly does bring in clients that do not have HTML rendering capability. 
I think the best way to address this would be for someone to volunteer to write up an Internet Draft describing a new status code, and its meaning, to cover the password expiration, and password refresh cases. 
I think it should scrupulously avoid functionality that would allow a user to reset their password, unless it involved returning the URL of a Web page that would allow the password to be reset. 
But, this wouldn't affect existing WebDAV clients fast enough to affect your current situation -- for that, one option is to use email as a notification service, telling users their passwords have expired.

WebDAV, but now I think it is critical to WebDAV. 
We a currently working on this issue with a large customer. 
With a normal HTTP client (one that renders html) it is possible to solve the expired password problem. 
However, with WebDAV clients there currently is no way to solve this problem. 
This is currently THE issue that is preventing the adoption of WebDAV for this customer. 
If we want to have people use the WebDAV protocol we have to be willing to solve problems like this one.
