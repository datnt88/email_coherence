<s> Minimally I think there should be some clear way to print out 10 or 15 pages that is enough to get started with RDF.  </s>

<s> "RDF can be used to represent information both about things that can be retrieved from the Web, and about things that can be identified on the Web but not retrieved.  </s>
<s> RDF provides a common framework for expressing information so it can be excahnged between applications without loss of meaning."  </s>

<s> We (the WG) have a serious problem with too much material.  </s>
<s> I suspect that Brian will be the only one of us sufficiently dedicated to read every page this time round.  </s>
<s> We do the community a disservice if we do not select the best material, and either downgrade or ditch the rest.  </s>
<s> One possible downgrade path would be to produce a book (RDF: the definitive guide - a load of WG names) after having produced a shorter set of specs - we might even make a buck or two.  </s>

<s> As you might imagine, I have not actually implemented changes responding to everyone's comments yet.  </s>
<s> I've been mostly working through Brian's comments, plus some additional work I'd been doing already (like synching the names of documents and the references).  </s>
<s> In the process, I have addressed a number of other folk's comments as well.  </s>
<s> I have, in particular, already made changes corresponding to the "critical" comments I've received, in particular: * changes to the typed literal section (2.6) as requested by Patrick and Brian * removing section 4.3.3 (RDF in HTML) as requested by DanC * removing section 6.4 (intelligent routing) as requested by Brian and DanC * removing some material in the section on containers as requested by Brian I will have to get to the other comments (particularly the more extensive ones like making separate pages or Appendices of sections 2.1 and 2.2) later.  </s>
<s> I do have one specific question right now for Jeremy:  </s>
<s> Do you mean the reference to RDF/XML, or the material on QNames?  </s>
