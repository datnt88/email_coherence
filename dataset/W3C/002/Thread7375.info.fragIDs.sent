<s> For the following questions, assume a collection C contains resource R, and suppose C is locked at Depth 0. Assume that resource S does not exist.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> Is it true that the lock on C has no effect on doing a PUT to R? (The protocol in 7.10.2 is clear that it affects ability to add or remove members, but says nothing about changing existing ones.) 2. In 8.4.1, which says "If a method, due to the presence of a Depth or Destination header, is applied to multiple resources then the No-tag-list production MUST be applied to each resource the method is applied to", what  </s>
<s> is the significance of "due to the presence of a Depth or Destination header"?  </s>
<s> Can a method be applied to multiple resources in any other way?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that it can.  </s>
<s> Consider a PUT to S (which does not yet exist).  </s>
<s> Certainly the PUT applies to S. Does it also "apply" to C? It seems to me that it does, or else why would the client have to pass the state token for the lock on C? Will someone please clarify 8.4.1?  </s>
<s> 3. In the case where the client has a lock on C, but no lock on R, and does not have the etag for R, is it possible for a client to use an _untagged_ production in the If header to pass the lock token on the C? If so, I don't see how to implement it.  </s>
<s> The production matches the state of C, but it will not match the state of R, so it will fail, and hence the PUT will fail.  </s>
<s> If this is right, it seems to me that the protocol document should say that a client SHOULD use tagged productions when the set of affected resources is known in advance and is small (as in this case) and it should explain  </s>
<s> the potential problem with using the no tagged production.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, clients will fail and programmers will be puzzled.  </s>
<s> If this is wrong, then a clarification in 8.4 is in order.  </s>
<s> Yes, it is true.  </s>
<s> To apply a method is a very specific term in HTTP and means that the method directly effects the state of one or more resources.  </s>
<s> The lock token submitted on a request for S does NOT effect the state of C. Rather it allows S's state to be effected as a consequence of confirming knowledge of C's state.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, issuing a DELETE on C most certainly effect's S's state since the method can not succeed unless S gets nuked.  </s>
<s> Thus I believe the section is absolutely crystalline clear.  </s>
<s> This example is too vague to properly respond to.  </s>
<s> You need to specify what  </s>
<s> method you are executing, what sort of lock you have on C, what its depth  </s>
<s> is, etc. and why you need to refer to C's lock in order to execute your  </s>
<s> method on R.  </s>
<s> You're right, the question was too vague.  </s>
<s> Here is another try.  </s>
<s> A client has an exclusive write lock on collection C at depth 0. The client wishes to create a new resource C/R by doing a PUT.  </s>
<s> The state token for C is needed because C/R did not exist previously (7.10.2) Suppose the client uses the non-tagged production in the If header.  </s>
<s> It includes the state token for the lock on C. 8.4 says "If the state of the resource to which the header is applied does not match any of the specified state lists than the request MUST fail".  </s>
<s> Clearly the PUT method is applied to C/R, yet there is no possible state token that the client can include that will match C/R.  </s>
<s> It does not even exist yet, it has no state at all.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the protocol should be amended with the material below in brackets.  </s>
<s> "If the state of the resource to which the header is applied does not match any of the specified state lists [and the resource is not null] than the request MUST fail".  </s>
<s> and with something to the effect of A client SHOULD use tagged productions rather than the no-tag-list production when the set of affected resources is known in advance and is small.  </s>
<s> As for my second question, I am sure the language of 8.4.1 is crystal clear to you.  </s>
<s> But you wrote it.  </s>
<s> My claim is that it is not crystal clear to me, and hence not likely to be crystal clear to others.  </s>
<s> To summarize, the two points of unclarity are: 1. the restrictive qualifier "due to the presence of a Depth or Destination header".  </s>
<s> 2. what it means to "apply".  </s>
<s> adding a cite to RFC 2068 would be sufficient if there's a clear statement there.  </s>
<s> or we could use the definition from your reply, which (editted) reads:  </s>
<s> To apply a method [to a resource] ... means that the method directly affects the state of [the] resource.  </s>
<s> But the protocol language as is is sufficiently unclear that even reasonably competent readers can have doubts about its meaning.  </s>
<s> I believe the spec is clear on the effects of the Depth 0 lock but I do admit that the term "Depth 0" gives the connotation that somehow the children aren't covered under the lock token.  </s>
<s> However Depth 0 in this  </s>
<s> context is only meant to reference the scope of the original LOCK method.  </s>
<s> That is, the original LOCK was only on the collection and thus was Depth 0. However the effect of a depth 0 write lock extends to the children in that PUT and DELETE is restricted on them as an effect of the lock.  </s>
<s> Thus  </s>
<s> submitted the write lock token for C in an untagged production on C/R is completely correct because the locktoken DOES describe C/R's state (or  </s>
<s> potential to have state, depending on how you actually define what it means to have an undefined resource, after all, if the resource isn't defined how could it return an error?  </s>
<s> But that is a philosophical discussion I will leave for Roy Fielding and his ilk).  </s>
<s> I will definitely record this issue in my list of things that could be clearer in WebDAV.  </s>

<s> To apply a method [to a resource] ... means that the method directly affects the state of [the] resource.  </s>
<s> Yes, the spec is quite clear on this point.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, since C is a collection, its state includes among other things the set of resources that it contains.  </s>
<s> Adding to or deleting from this set affects C's state, and hence one needs the locktoken.  </s>
<s> It is also clear that for (pre-existing) resource C/R, doing a PUT (overwriting it) does not affect C's state, so one does not need the lock token.  </s>
<s> Sounds reasonable, but I would like this to be stated explicitly in the spec, perhaps as an example, because it certainly is not obvious even after careful study.  </s>
