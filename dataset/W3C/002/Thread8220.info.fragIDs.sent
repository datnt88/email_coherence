<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Also, this update shouldn't cause much problem anyway, as everyone seems to have gone with UTF-8.  </s>

<s> Simply keeping it optional (as XML does) should be effectively the same.  </s>
<s> For world-wide interoperability, it is good to have Unicode as a MUST.  </s>

<s> Well, if a client/server uses an optional encoding (and any except UTF-8 and UTF-16 *is* optional in XML), it may have to live with the fact that the other side requests the message, so there's no guaranteed interoperability.  </s>

<s> But the whole point in *having* an  </s>
<s> open internet protocol is to take care of the case where you *don't* control both sides.  </s>
<s> Yes, and I agree with that completely.  </s>
<s> My point was leaving encodings other than UTF-(8|16) as OPTIONAL by not mentioning is good enough, because XML states it as optional.  </s>
<s> Stating it as MUST NOT in the spec is more than necessary.  </s>

<s> I think this is a good change, though I think it would be good for 2518bis to explicitly note that this means UTF-8 and UTF-16, since the mandatory encodings specified in the XML REC are not common knowledge.  </s>
<s> I think UTF-16 use would, at present, cause multiple interoperability problems.  </s>
<s> It would be very useful to add some UTF-16 tests to the Litmus compliance test tool, to strt moving the community in the right direction.  </s>
