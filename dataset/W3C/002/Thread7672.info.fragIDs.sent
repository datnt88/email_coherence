<s> It was actually initially written so that it asked for the creation of a binding at the Request-URI to the resource identified by the Destination header.  </s>
<s> The rationale for this was that it seemed more intuitive to have the syntax of the request reflect the natural-language request: Create a binding from this segment to this resource.  </s>
<s> (Anyhow, that's how the spec always expresses the request in English.) And it seems as if the Request-URI should identify the resource for which authorization would be required to fulfill the request.  </s>
<s> It's the collection where the binding lives that gets modified, and so update permission would be needed on that collection, and so that collection should be identified by the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> We changed this to be consistent with the usage in COPY and MOVE, thinking that it would be too confusing otherwise.  </s>
<s> And servers would have to interpret the Overwrite header differently for BIND than for COPY / MOVE if we used the Request-URI and the Destination header differently than COPY / MOVE.  </s>
<s> We did not consider the implications of adding weak bindings.  </s>
<s> But I would personally rather go back to the original syntax than introduce a new header (or even suggest that such a header be introduced in the future) that would flip the meanings of the Request-URI and Destination header in a given request.  </s>
<s> That is, I would propose that in all BIND requests, the Request-URI identify the new binding, and the Destination header identify the existing resource being bound to.  </s>
<s> If it still seems unacceptable to be in conflict with the syntax of MOVE / COPY, I would rather just go ahead and define a new header now that would always be used in BIND requests to identify the resource being bound to.  </s>

<s> I believe that eventually we will be forced to make it possible to specify a bind both ways.  </s>
<s> That is, one can send the request either to the source or the destination.  </s>
<s> The reason has to do with how many tightly bound (and weakly bound) systems are likely to be implemented.  </s>
<s> I will use a real world example to help illustrate.  </s>
<s> Imagine I have server S1 and server S2.  </s>
<s> They both share the same tightly replicated NTFS volume.  </s>
<s> Both servers map onto a particular file in the NTFS volume.  </s>
<s> Following the specification provided by both the Exchange and NT WebDAV implementations the WebDAV properties associated with that file are recorded as an "alternate" stream on that file.  </s>
<s> Alternate streams are a feature in Windows 2000 implementation of NTFS that allows one to have multiple independent named streams off a file.  </s>
<s> What this means is that someone can come in through SMB, move a file and all its WebDAV properties will remain because the file system will move all the streams associated with the file.  </s>
<s> (Yes, I recognize the problems this can cause) Anyway, S1 is just a standard issue W2K WebDAV server and so serves off files from the NTFS volume.  </s>
<s> S2, on the other hand, is an enhanced WebDAV server that has support for BIND.  </s>
<s> S1 and S2 can both refer to the same file on the NTFS volume and still meet all the BIND integrity requirements.  </s>
<s> However only S2 can explicitly create new bindings since S1 doesn't support the BIND method.  </s>
<s> Therefore if one wants to creating a binding to a file currently pointed to by S1 then the request must be sent to S2 (S2, btw, can figure out what file S1 is pointing at by checking the metabase, but that is a whole other story).  </s>
<s> However the reverse is also true, if one wants to create a binding to a file pointed to by S2 then the request MUST also go to S2 because S1 doesn't understand BIND.  </s>
<s> Therefore what is needed is the ability to specify a BIND request which can choose to either have the source or the destination in the request-URI.  </s>
<s> I expect that eventually the exact same thing will happen to COPY and MOVE.  </s>
<s> The only reason it didn't happen in RFC 2518 is that we all knew that for a really long time COPY and MOVE would only work within a single server so we weren't particularly worried about the issue.  </s>
<s> We probably should have been but one has to pick one's battles.  </s>
<s> Don't be too surprised to see the same source/destination flexibility introduced into the next version of RFC 2518.  </s>
<s> Either way, I don't care if we solve this problem in the current BIND spec so long as we leave the door open to solving the problem later.  </s>
<s> That is why I asked for the very limited language.  </s>
<s> If the authors really want to tackle the whole problem that is fine with me but I didn't want to force them to do so.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> Yep, that's what it should be.  </s>
<s> Not only does the request-URI indicate the point of modification, it also determines the mechanism within the server responsible for handling that namespace -- something which absolutely must be done *before* interpreting the method (except for TRACE).  </s>
<s> Oh, shoot me.  </s>
<s> For some lame reason I missed that when WebDAV went up for review, since the semantics in HTTP have always been that the request-URI represents the target of the modification, for the same reason that most assembler languages use the first operand as the destination.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer it be done the natural way rather than being consistent with COPY and MOVE.  </s>
