PFTF'ers: Well, after much discussion, we managed to get features and properties into WSDL 1.2 with an overwhelmingly positive vote. 
See the F2F summary [1] for a description of what we ended up with. 
At this point, the most immediate job of the task force is complete. 
However, I think there is definite value in continuing forward with the cross-group TF to flesh out the scenarios we've been discussing and research the potential value of the Features/Properties approach to extension design. 
This needs to be discussed with Jonathan and Mike/Dave, so I propose today we have a short telcon simply to discuss future directions, since I know everyone's been busy (including myself) and we haven't had an explicit mandated agenda after the WSDL change. 
Sorry for the short notice, which is another reason I'm figuring today's call can be very casual. 
11AM EST, you know the number, you know the passcode [2]. 
Talk to you then!

Anyone else having trouble dialing in? 
I get 'passcode invalid'.

Yup. Let's plan to discuss the TF's future (if any) on the WSD and WSA calls this week. 
Thanks, all, sorry about the confusion.

Back in my office after trying to get my laptop fixed. 
I did not schedule a time for this week, not knowing if people were willing to have a teleconference after the technical plenary week. 
Let's synchronize during the WSD/WSA calls and I'll make sure we have Zakim for next week. 
In any case, I won't be able to make the call next week since I'll be travelling (with my laptop if it manages to survive Philippe
