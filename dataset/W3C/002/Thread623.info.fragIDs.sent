I downloaded TidyGUI on 2 December 2000 I have installed a shortcut on my Win 2000 Pro desktop that has Target: D:\HTML\Tidy\TidyGUI.exe -c TidyConfiguration.txt Start In: D:\HTML\Tidy 
The configuration file is located in the same directory as TidyGUI.exe and is: 
// HTML Tidy configuration file created by TidyGUI error-file: TidyErrors.txt tidy-mark: no enclose-text: yes enclose-block-text: yes drop-empty-paras: yes When I click on the desktop icon, TidyGUI does start with the configuration 
file loaded, however, when I then browse to select a .html 
file and press the Tidy button, the error file does not get written to the disk. 
If I use tidy -config TidyConfiguration.txt from the command line, the error file does get written. 
When running from the command line, I put the .html 
file in the same directory as tidy.exe. 
What do I need to do to produce the errors file? 
Sorry, but as stated in the documentation (http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyGUI/) 
TidyGUI doesn't write error files, even if you can set this option. 
If you really need that, I might change it in the future.

Being able to save the error log is important so that analysis of errors can be done at a later time, perhaps even printing the errors and studying them whilst on the porcelain throne. 
Did v 1.1.5 add an option to write an error file?
