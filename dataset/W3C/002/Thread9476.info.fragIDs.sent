<s> Pat in a later post proposed to distinguish the proposal I originally labeled X  </s>
<s> as URV and use X to denote the proposal in: The distinction is useful and I suggest we consider both.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Concerning this topic, I think it is important to differentiate between generic statements, statements attributed to some authority, and statements asserted by some authority.  </s>
<s> These three distinctions are all addressed by the X proposal.  </s>
<s> Please see the ontology defined therein and the included example (if you haven't already ;-) It also address the reification issue, which has been deferred, but possibly could be readdressed in terms of the X proposal.  </s>
<s> Regards, Patrick  </s>
<s> Hi Patrick,  </s>
<s> There is a proposal for closing this issue in  </s>
<s> I'm not clear what you are saying here.  </s>
<s> Are you objecting to the proposal?  </s>
<s> If so, please could you make clear your reasons for objecting.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> My chief concern is that qualification of statements in general, which subsumes this issue is cumbersome to do as presently defined and that even though the particular issue should be deferred to later and IMO addressed by the definition of a specialized ontology for qualifying statements according to particular needs; we may need to consider changes, extensions, or clarifications to the current model which would make such solutions easier to achieve.  </s>
<s> So, I guess I'm not really objecting to the proposal, and these concerns about the model are represented in my X proposal and recent posts, so I retract any implied objection to the proposal.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> Hi Patrick,  </s>
<s> Thank you for that clarification Brian  </s>
<s> I'd like to support Dan's suggestion, exept tat I'd chage staw for straw Sergey  </s>
