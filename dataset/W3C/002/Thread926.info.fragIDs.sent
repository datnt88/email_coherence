Hello, 
Why Tidy do not close empty tags (such as br/ ) as it is precisely defined in the XHTML 1.0 Recommendations (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.6) ??? 
How can i do to enable that functionnality ? 
thx, Fabrice 
If the input is HTML and you don't request different output Tidy will output HTML.

Fabrice, are you sure that you are not checking an HTML document. 
In these case, the only tag of an empty element looks exactly as the opening tag of any other. 
In HTML (3.2, 4.0, 4.1), break-line is br . 
The / in br/ is part of the XML Markup (that makes it easy for the parser not to confuses incorrect stand alone opening tags and tags of empty-elements) Jany
