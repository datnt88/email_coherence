<s> I would like to propose that a bit more time is given to resolving the datatyping issues at the F2F.  </s>
<s> Both Pat and I will be there, as will Jeremy and Graham.  </s>
<s> I would like to verify whether Sergey will also be present.  </s>
<s> If all three editors as well as most of the individuals with outstanding concerns/issues will be present, then I think it behooves us to make use of that opportunity to expidite closure.  </s>
<s> Sergey, can you confirm that you will be attending?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Patrick  </s>
<s> I think the prime directive for the F2F should be to wrap up as much as possible.  </s>
<s> I'm concerned that datatypes could prove to be a rathole.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I suggest that if it is scheduled, its allocated slot be towards the end of the f2f time.  </s>

<s> I'm still waiting for my UK visa (alas, I need one).  </s>
<s> If I get it on time, I'll be there... Sergey  </s>
