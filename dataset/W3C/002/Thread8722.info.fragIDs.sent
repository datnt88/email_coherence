<s> Strictly speaking, XML v1.0 defines "ANY" to mean "any of the elements defined in the DTD" whereas we would like it to mean "PDCDATA or any well-formed XML instance".  </s>
<s> Hence, the DTD model is really inadequate here though some might consider "ANY" to be closer than "PCDATA".  </s>
<s> Note: The XML Schema model allows one to say that any well-formed XML instances can be the content of an element.  </s>

<s> (ANY = element types within the DTD).  </s>

<s> An element type has mixed content when elements of that type may contain character data, optionally interspersed with child elements.  </s>

<s> Sorry, I did not know the exact meaning of #PCDATA (see below).  </s>
<s> With the definition Ed gives for it , the DTD of Object seems to be what it should be ;-)  </s>
<s> I have also made this experience with a XML parser API from Sun: If I declare then the instance does not validate.  </s>
<s> The validating API parser throws an exception because it only expects character data.  </s>
<s> So this parser does not behave like #PCDATA is intended to mean (as Ed described in his contribution).  </s>
