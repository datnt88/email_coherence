[1] is the Editors' Draft that includes Boyer's latest Xpath [a], the latest Schema syntax [b], and fairly straightforward editorial changes (some in red) based on Last Call Comments [2]. 
[1] and the substantive issues left in [2] will be good reading material prior for the FTF.

Hi Joseph, 
I just have glanced at both the schema definitions and the new schema drafts. 
Unfortunately the schema drafts have undergone lots of changes (apart from the change to simpletype/complextype), e. g. * the '*' value in maxOccurs is now called 'unbounded' * the former group attribute "order" with values like "sequence", "choice" 
has been rejected. 
These semantics now can be exressed by subelements named "sequence", "choice". 
* the former simple type "uri" is now called "uriReference" Somewhere along this reading I have stopped, since I am not very familiar with 
the new drafts, and I think I sometimes have to work through the whole matter more intensively. 
To put it in a nutshell, I think we must (once again) redesign our schema definitions so that they conform with XML Schema again. 
BTW: 
In [1] I found out that you have not found one of my reported typos. 
Actually the parenthesis can be found in section 2.1.1 (and not in 2.2.1, as I stated before): 
The verifier may obtain the digested content in another method so long as the digest verifies. 
In particular, the verifier may obtain the content from a different location such as a local store) than that specified in the URI.

Hi Gregor, 
That's why I couldn't find it! 
smile Fixed. 
"choice" 
Right you are. 
Odd. 
Perhaps I can explain it in that I've been using Henry Thompson's validator and maybe it's still permitting bits of the older syntax. 
However, he's presently rewriting it for public release, so I'll speak to him about the above.

Actually, I checked the schema file, and it references the January draft not the last call. 
So since I said I'll review last call I'll go through and make the changes for the post FTF meeting draft.
