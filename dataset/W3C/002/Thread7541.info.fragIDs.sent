<s> The deadline for submission of Internet Drafts before the upcoming IETF meeting is Friday, March 13, at 5PM US Eastern time.  </s>
<s> Since drafts submitted on the deadline before the Washington meeting were actually showing up in the I-D directory *during* the Washington IETF, I recommend submitting I-Ds a week in advance of the deadline.  </s>
<s> An I-D submitted right before a meeting has no more special status than one submitted at any other time, but, given its proximity to the meeting, it has the possibility of being more relevant and in-synch with current concerns and discussion.  </s>
<s> The conventional wisdom for submitting I-Ds before the meeting is so that people coming to the meeting will have enough time to read the relevant I-Ds before the meeting.  </s>
<s> Certainly, regular submission of I-Ds indicates that activity is taking place on a particular topic.  </s>
<s> However, as far as the IETF is concerned, the major progress indicators are documents submitted to the IESG.  </s>
<s> There's very much a "move it or lose it" attitude in the IETF.  </s>

<s> Anyone may submit an I-D.  </s>
<s> While the Chair of a working group does have discretion over which I-Ds are considered official work items of a particular working group, it is certainly possible for someone to develop a draft and submit it as an Internet-Draft at any time (except for the blackout period before an IETF meeting).  </s>
<s> The "sketchyness" of I-Ds varies.  </s>
<s> A draft must be complete enough to convey your ideas, and must be sufficiently well-thought to avoid embarassment.  </s>
<s> As for your enumeration of drafts, I will leave the discussion of DASL-related drafts to the Distributed Authoring Searching and Locating mailing list, www-webdav-dasl@w3.org.  </s>
<s> As for the requirements for external members/ordered collections, I have encouraged Judith Slein to submit such a draft before the I-D deadline so we can discuss external members/ordered collections at the LA IETF.  </s>
<s> I certainly think such a draft should be a work item of this working group.  </s>
<s> Since there will be relatively few open issues in the Distributed Authoring specification during the LA IETF, I anticipate the discussion at the LA IETF will mostly focus on ordered collections requirements issues.  </s>

<s> It's always is a good idea to go into a BOF with explicit internet drafts.  </s>
<s> They're part of what the IESG looks at to see if the working group's charter is feasible and that there's a core of interest.  </s>
<s> The cutoff date is March 13 5 PM EST, but getting them in sooner than that is a very good idea.  </s>
<s> If the draft is "sketchy", just say so in the preface.  </s>
<s> I have just redone the requirements draft incorporating feedback on the list.  </s>
<s> I submitted this as an ID today.  </s>
<s> The DASL protocol authors are reviewing a 'sketchy' protocol draft as we speak.  </s>
<s> We will be submitting this before the deadline also.  </s>
