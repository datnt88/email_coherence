<s> Another attempt after previous threads: RDF M&amp;S provides valid (if rather unclear) definitions of how to interpret an rdf:ID in a propertyElt in two cases, when the element is empty / non-empty.  </s>
<s> This answers the issue which asked why both ID and resource were not allowed on an empty element - there is a reason, and I point to it in the previous message.  </s>
<s> I feel that changing this definition to make it consistent with other parts of the syntax is not a good enough reason given that existing parsers may have implemented it.  </s>
<s> However, I have thought of another problem.  </s>
<s> XML parsers (I think) are not required to let applications distinguish between: and The only reference I can find to it is: Appendix D: What is not in the Information Set 7. The difference between the two forms of an empty element: foo/ and foo /foo .  </s>
<s> -- XML InfoSet http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#omitted  </s>
<s> In at least two common XML X parsers I have used (expat and libxml), these cannot be distinguished, they both return the same two  </s>
<s> events/callbacks: start element, end element.  </s>
<s> Since many systems use these as the standard XML parsers (this includes Perl, Apache, Python, GNOME) they thus may not be able to distinguish and so RDF applications of these systems cannot make any decision based on this either.  </s>
<s> I feel that if this impacts any part of the RDF syntax that has a dependency on the distinction, it should be changed - and that includes this case.  </s>
<s> This is a much better reason to change - cannot be implemented in practice.  </s>
<s> For this reason I would propose that we make a change here that is implementable and consistent with the outcome of the Issue http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-empty-property-elements owned by Jan Grant.  </s>
<s> and this issue should be on hold until that one is resolved.  </s>
<s> Over to you Jan...  </s>

<s> We're all in agreement here (as far as I can tell) that the two forms above should have the same interpretation (this has been made more or less explicit by various people).  </s>
<s> This kind of led to the suggestion that an RDF grammar should be given in terms of the XML infoset rather than a BNF grammar producing a stream of characters.  </s>
<s> Certainly coping with empty elements explicitly wherever  </s>
<s> they might crop up in the current grammar would obfuscate it (in my opinion).  </s>
<s> And we'd have no future-proofing when XML-foo invented something useful that we wanted to take advantage of when serialising RDF as XML.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we might stick with a simple grammar for serialised RDF and include something to the effect: "any stream of XML tokens that is equivalent to this serialisation (wrt.  </s>
<s> {a subset of the XML infoset}) is also a valid serialised form, and should be interpreted equivalently."  </s>
