A revised draft of the datatyping document is available: 
Many thanks to Graham for the desiderata, and to Patrick Stickler for two important contributions: 
1. The editorial changes to the previous version (marked in red). 
2. Spotting of a third original idiom (called P in the document), in which typed elements are interpreted as elements of the datatype mapping.

For some reason I've overlooked checking this sooner. 
I observe that your idiom P is idiom D in the current desiderata. 
Interestingly, I had a different idea about how to do this under scheme S, but either works for me.

Graham, could you share your idea briefly? 
I'm curious!

OK, the P idiom is this: Jenny exP:birthDate _:a . 
_:a rdf:value "2001-07-15" . 
_:a rdf:type exP:date . 
or, for a global typing idiom, instead of the final triple, use: exP:birthDate rdfs:range exP:date . 
You suggest that exP:date is the same as xsd:date.map; 
i.e. it denotes the data type mapping, whose class extension is a set of value,lexical pairs. 
The denotation of _:a is then a value,lexical pair, and the property rdf:value then is used like a "selector", in that it relates a member of its subject pair to a lexical that is its object; it's relational extension would contain:  15 July 2001,"2001-07-15" , "2001-07-15"  . 
My thought was that exP:date here could be the same as xsd:date.lex, 
and rdf:value was an identity relation, so the denotation of _:a would be just a lexical. 
The relational extension of rdf:value would contain "2001-07-15","2001-07-15" . 
That's it.
