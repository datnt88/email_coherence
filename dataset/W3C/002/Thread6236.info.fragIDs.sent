<s> On Wednesday's call[1], we were discussing pattern p2d (request with response to third party), and I said that I had forgotten to put in a third parameter for the address of the third party to receive the response: dbooth p2d: David: oops, i_p2d is missing a third parameter for the third party Scribe: void sendMessage(ServiceAddress s, Message m); ... - void sendMessage(ServiceAddress s, Message m, ResponseDestinationAddress rda); However, in thinking about this later, it isn't clear to me what mechanism would be used to communicate the ResponseDestinationAddress to the service.  </s>
<s> The client and service would have to agree on some mechanism, but we have nothing in the WSDL 1.2 spec about this.  </s>
<s> Would it be application-specific?  </s>
<s> Or binding-specific?  </s>
<s> Or what?  </s>
<s> Comments?  </s>
