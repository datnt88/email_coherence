I would like to highlight the choicepoints. 
I'm keen on this as well - review choicepoints and be prepared to discuss. 
a follow-up useful for establishing my view as well This chairs position was to not reopen the issue at this time, but to indicate that if a slam dunk proposal was submitted to the WG, then I would not be opposed, provided it did not delay us. 
8) New Document A new draft of 'Resource Description Framework (RDF): Overview and Abstract Data Model' is available at: Graham to do quick intro; Graham if you have specific issues that need to be addressed by individuals/editors, please be prepared to discuss this as well. 
Graham, in particular see next agenda item. 
9) rdfns-assertion See: I'm frankly confused if this issue is open or not, but I think this issue is addressed in Graham's document but still needs review - 
There was some discussion at the f2f of the assertion issue against a background of social aspects of RDF deployment (in discussions in/after the telecon prior to the F2F, the omission of any discussion of the social environment of RDF deployment had been noted). 
Section 2.3 of the new RDF document resulted from this. 
Assertion is covered at sub-section 2.3.4 (and still needs review/discussion). 
If I am wrong I'm happy simply to have this noted and skip over this :) 10) Procedure for determining reserved vocabulary ACTION:2002-06-28#1 jjc write a message about possible bug in guha's option#2 See: From last week, as we have not made a decision on this, WG please be prepared to do so. 
11) Schedule and Process to Last Call See: I'd like to present Brian with a present when he returns from a well-deserved vacation. 
12) Datatypes err.. 
Any suggestions on how to proceed here? 
This agenda *really wanted to be* produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant eric miller http://www.w3.org/people/em/ semantic web activity lead http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ w3c world wide web consortium http://www.w3.org/ 
That's spot on, as far as I'm concerned. 
I invite folks to review section 2.3 in: which attempts an account of the social context of RDF deployment, and in particular section 2.3.2 which I believe tackles the assertion issue as raised. 
The subsequent sub-sections try to explain how the social and formal aspects can work together.

Thanks for the warning! 
This message constitutes my prepared input, to which I'll talk in the telecon. 
Hopefully, a URI of the message can go into the IRC log/minutes. 
These are the notes I'll use for that purpose: - 25 July version of the document has had two main sections removed, per telecon 2002-07-12, and now contains three substantive sections: 2. Goals, rationale, key features 3. Definition of RDF graph syntax 4. Other technical issues - Feedback received already from Dave Beckett, much of which is in the process of being folded in (but not in the version noted above). 
- The main points as yet incomplete or needing review: - section 2.2.5, datatypes (pending outcome of datatype discussion) - Section 2.3, needs review: this is new text and new topic material since F2F - Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2: Dave Beckett has asked these be removed in favour of a reference to the syntax document. 
I agree, but currently see no corresponding list in the syntax document. 
- Section 3: need to liaise with PatH to ensure description is consistent with MT usage (JJC will pursue this) - Section 3: some test cases cited are still subject to group agreement - Section 3: various comments from DaveB, JJC is reviewing these - Section 4.2: needs review: this discussion of fragment identifiers is new material compared with what has been discussed before; it is a synthesis of my own thoughts and comments by PatH and TimBL (though any errors are, of course, all mine). 
- Section 4.2 also laps at the edges of a current TAG discussion, and we'll want to make sure it's not inconsistent and in particular the document text: In view of this, it is reasonable to consider that URIs without fragment identifiers are most helpfully used for indicating web-retrievable resources (when used in RDF), and URIs with fragment identifiers are used for abstract ideas that don't have a direct web representation. 
This is not a hard-and-fast distinction, as the line between resources having or not having a web-retrievable representation is sometimes hard to draw precisely. 
Noted: see separate message.

I think everything it says is right, but it somehow reads slightly 'tangled'; I can imagine coming away from it feeling rather baffled about what one has actually been told. 
Let me suggest that an example might help. 
I used one in a presentation last week which amused the Irish members of the audience, but which you might want to alter for a more general readership. 
Imagine three websites each publishing some RDF. 
Gobshite rdf:type rdfs:Class . 
Gobshite rdfs:comment "Gobshite is an insulting Irish term of abuse; a 'gobshite' is a habitual liar who often speaks nonsense, so their word is not to be trusted." and lets suppose this is all that one can find on the website about that term. 
B:Irish rdf:subClassOf http://ex.insultlexicon.com#Gobshite . 
Now, it follows by the formal RDF model theory that these three together entail which I might reasonably consider an insult. 
Why? 
Not because of the RDF model theory, which merely says I am in some class about which nothing can be *formally* inferred. 
However, the rdf:comment associated with that class name by the owner of that name provides the insulting content *in the social context of web publication*, even though it cannot be formally inferred via the RDF inference rules. 
But who has insulted me? 
A merely defined the term; B doesn't mention me in particular, so even A and B together do not insult *me*. 
And C might argue that although he refers to me, he only asserts that I am Irish, which is not in itself grounds for a libel suit. 
However, I think that I could reasonably claim that C is to blame, since C uses not a generic term 'Irish', but a particular uriref which is defined by its owner (B) in a way which is clearly insulting, since B in turn explicitly refers to, and uses, the term defined by A. Thus, C's use of a B-defined term suggests a clear intent by C to convey a meaning defined by B, by virtue of a definition by A, which is insulting. 
Note that this argument depends on another social convention of RDF, which is that urirefs 'belong to' their original publishers who are therefore responsible for defining their meanings. 
By using the local name http://AngloSaxon.org#Irish instead of some term defined in, say, a lexicon of national names, B has explicitly removed his term 'Irish' from any *formal* connection with the Land of Erin. 
In order to succeed in his probable intent of making a generic slander against my countrymen, B should have used a term which was defined by someone else, such as: and then if C had also used this first uriref, then in spite of a similar formal inference chain generating the insulting conclusion about me, I think that I would have nobody to sue; since now C would indeed have simply made a harmless observation about my ancestry, and B's assertion, while indeed arguably racist and offensive, makes no reference to me in particular. 
The point of this example is to emphasize that publication of RDF, when considered as a social act, constitutes a publication of some content which is defined by whatever normal *social* conditions are used by the publishers of any terms in the RDF to define the meanings of those terms, even if those meanings and definitions are not accessible to the formal semantics of RDF; and, moreover, those meanings are preserved under any formally sanctioned inference processes. 
In a nutshell, the formal entailments of social meanings are themselves part of the social meaning. 
Note that we cannot use a single notion of 'meaning' to say this properly, since of course the formal entailments cannot themselves utilize the social aspects of meaning which are included in informal aspects of the publication, such as the fact that 'Gobshite' is insulting, which is only mentioned in a comment which is opaque to any likely RDF inference engine or machine processor. 
Social meanings can be, as it were, transferred or carried by formal entailments, but they cannot be incorporated into the formal entailments. 
To emphasize this, suppose that B had failed to use rdfs:subClassOf and instead had tried to use his own term: B:Irish B:oneOfThem http://ex.insultlexicon.com#Gobshite . 
B:oneOfThem rdf:comment "This means the same as subClassOf" . 
then in spite of the clear social meaning of the comment, there would be no *formal* inference path from this and the A and C publications 
to anything that I could find insulting; so even if C had intended to bad-mouth me, B's stupidity would have thwarted him. 
Hope this helps.

Very, very much, it helps while away the time pleasantly ;-) And yes, it helps on rdfms-assertion, too, though it may need to be edited just a touch before release in a WD, no? 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you in Montreal in August at Extreme Markup 2002? 
Pat, as usual, your words illustrate the point very vividly. 
I expect I could rework it to a more professionally acceptable form, even if it would lose some of it's colour in the process (and probably also some of its illustrative power). 
Following input from Jos, I've reworked some of those sections to use some wording based on an earlier contribution of Pat's, whose overall effect is to reduce the volume of text without (I think) any loss of meaning (see excerpt below). 
So my questions are: (a) is the proposed rewording (below) any clearer? 
(b) should I work in the example -- I'm thinking an edited version might appear as a new section 2.3.5, illustrating what has gone before. 
I think final resolution of this could be left to a future WD round? 
#g Current new text for sections 2.3.3, 2.3.4: 
2.3.3 Interaction between social and formal meaning Using RDF, 'received meaning' can be characterized as the social meaning of any logical consequences. 
If you publish a graph G and G logically entails G', and we interpret G' using the same social conventions that everyone agrees could be reasonably used to interpret G, then you are asserting that content of G' as well. 
Human publishers of RDF content commit themselves to the mechanically-inferred social obligations. 
The machines doing the inferences aren't expected to know about all these social conventions and obligations. 
The social conventions used to interpret a graph may include assumed truths, for which no logical derivation is available, and socially accepted consequences whose rules of deduction are embedded in arbitrary decision- making processes. 
Semantic web vocabulary gains currency through use, so also do semantic web deductionshave force through social acceptance. 
Semantic web deduction operates in a combination of logical and social (non-logical) dimensions. 
To support logical entailments, formal RDF meaning is based on a model theory (see section 2.3.1). 
The notion of truth is crucial: a possible world may correspond to some RDF if and only if the RDF statement is true in that world. 
The RDF core language provides a way to make simple formal assertions, with no machinery for formalizing allowable inferences. 
Inferences are performed by processes, embedded in software implentations, whose validity is not formally demonstrable, and must be assumed or trusted to be socially acceptable. 
It is expected that semantic web languages layered on RDF will give formal expression to allowable inferences, thus to allow provable deductions by generic software modules to replace individual ad-hoc implemenations. 
2.3.4 Implications of asserting RDF When an RDF graph is asserted in the web, its publisher is saying something about their view of the world. 
(The mechanism for deciding whether or not a graph is asserted is not defined here, but it is presumed that the publisher's intent will be clear in some way.) 
When a user invokes an application, there is also a social and technical context of invocation that determines some set of RDF assertions that will be assumed to be true: the application itself, and any RDF files that are passed to it. 
Garbage-in, garbage-out applies: if the initial assumed facts are wrong or meaningless, the results will have little value. 
No specfic mechanisms for deciding or evaluating the validity of any such assertions are defined here. 
Noting that there is no single human opinion about the truth of some statements, the graph may further contain commentary for human interpreters to indicate the realm of human interpretation that should be applied. 
This means a graph may contain "defining information" that is opaque to logical reasoners. 
This information may be used by human interpreters of RDF informaton, or programmers writing software to perform specialized forms of deduction in the Semantic Web.

I hope it's not disloyal to say that I prefer Pat's example to your text ... I rather like (I think Brian's idea of) including Pat's example as a test case rather than as an example in the WD. Jeremy
