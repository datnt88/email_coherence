<s> I was just checking through the requirements papers to see what has been covered so far, and what is missing.  </s>
<s> It looks pretty good.  </s>
<s> Aside from Relationships and versioning, which are known gaps, the following requirements are not addressed: Source retrieval -- Addressed briefly in 2.2 Standard Attributes, but this would be easy to miss.  </s>
<s> Although this strategy would work, it doesn't seem very intuitive to treat source as an attribute.  </s>
<s> The source is the resource.  </s>
<s> Partial Write --Judy Name:Judith A. Slein E-Mail:slein@wrc.xerox.com  </s>
<s> MailStop:128-29E  </s>
<s> The source attribute points to the URI of the resource which is the source of the document.  </s>
<s> Also, HTTP 1.1 supports partial writes.  </s>
<s> If my laptop doesn't die on me I should have a pre-edited copy of the spec out tomorrow night with the versioning section.  </s>
<s> I would very much like to hear how it stacks up.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> Thank you, Judy, for evaluating the specification against the requirements.  </s>
<s> I agree that some extra text emphasizing what the source attribute is useful for would be helpful.  </s>
<s> The idea of the source attribute is that if a GET is performed on a resource's source attribute, it lets the server know that it shouldn't perform any processing on the resource before transmission.  </s>
<s> It was initially conceived as a read-only attribute.  </s>
<s> I'm unsure whether this should only be a read-only attribute, though.  </s>
<s> There might be some value to having a place to write where the client would be guaranteed the server would not perform any processing on the resource which was just PUT. - Jim  </s>
