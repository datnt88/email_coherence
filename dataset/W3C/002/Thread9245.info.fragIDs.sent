13: Any Other Business 
This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena meeting assistant 
I'd really like to see the group decide to publish at least 
one document in this Friday's meeting. 
This agenda puts a lot of stuff between us and any such decision: 
it suggests that all three drafts get equal time, and it puts review of a whole bunch of actions before discussion of the drafts. 
I'd like the chairs (and/or WG folks and/or editors) to pick one document that looks most ready and put "shall we publish XYZ?" at/near the top of the agenda. 
Regarding reviewing action items... Eric Miller and I have spent some time formalizing the business of meeting records and such ( and we discovered that there are two styles for reviewing old business: 
(a) each action stands on its own, and all outstanding actions are reviewed together at the beginning of the meeting. 
(b) keep each outstanding action under the agenda item in which it was raised, and carry forward things at the granularity of agenda items, rather than of action items. 
I'm starting to prefer style (b). 
Style (a) really only works if, for each action item, folks just say done/not done, and we move on. 
But we always discuss them, 
and that's usually a good thing. 
Style (a) suggests all actions have the same priority, which is higher than the priority of all other agenda items; I think that's rarely the case. 
I'll take a whack at restoring the context around the outstanding actions, and I'll suggest that the chairs re-sort the resulting list of agenda items.

What's Jema? 
pointer? 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
Minor bit of java. 
RDF models drive agenda generator and irc bot. 
hopelessly crude at the moment. 
just trying it out to see if worth developing further.

OK... here are the agenda items that I see, with the outstanding actions tucked under the relevant agenda items. 
I suggest that the chairs sort this list by telcon-time-priority. == Review Minutes of previous meeting with corrections: ACTION: Martyn to update glosary document and collect feedback was CONTINUED ACTION 2001-08-02#33: disposition should read POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER NEXT SCHEMA WD See: == rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf ACTION: 2001-08-02#14 Pat Hayes Discuss cycles in rdfs:subClassOf and rdfs:subPropertyOf with DAML folks and report back to us.

Yes. Took us far too long last week to get to anything substantive. 
Lets try and get through the action review in under 5 mins. 
At least for this week. 
I think that can be done. 
I'd rather spend my time between now and the telecon reviewing the docs. 
Syntax is first on the agenda because my memory from last week's telecon was we decided that was the one we would do first.
