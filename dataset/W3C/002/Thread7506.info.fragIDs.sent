<s> 2.5 says "a property name is ... associated with a schema that provides information about the syntax and semantics of the property"  </s>
<s> My understanding is that the only place the scheme of properties is defined is this specification, in the BNF and DTD in the text.  </s>
<s> (Machine readable property schema are out of scope for WebDAV.) But readers are likely to ask whether it is available online.  </s>
<s> Is there any group seeking to develop a machine-readable form for property schema, and if so should we point to them?  </s>
<s> There is but the efforts are EXTREMELY preliminary.  </s>
<s> The work is being done in the W3C and as far as I am aware there isn't even an official working group yet, I think it is just scoped as part of the over all XML effort.  </s>
<s> Jim (Whitehead) do you know more?  </s>

<s> Just to elaborate on (my own) question: As far as I know, DAV does not provide any means whereby a client can determine any of the following is property P (on server S) live or dead?  </s>
<s> if it is live is it readonly? the syntax (a date, an integer, a 1# list of properties, etc intended semantics (stated in natural language, not some formal lang) (Well, perhaps it could be done by trial and error!) Nor are there conventions whereby clients could assert similar such information about dead properties.  </s>
<s> (The server would not enforce them, but at least clients could say what they meant.)  </s>
<s> These are desirable, but not mandatory.  </s>
<s> In particular they could go into a future spec.  </s>
<s> I am sure that RDF, to name only one technology, would be of sufficient expressive power to handle this.  </s>
<s> The point of this mailnote with regards to the current specification is to ask that a sentence of two be inserted to say that this is NOT in WebDAV now, (so don't bother looking for it) and perhaps to point to current work that might lead to it, because it's a very natural thing to want to have, and many readers will likely wonder.  </s>
<s> I should also point out that the DMA API http://www.aiim.org/industry/standards/#dma  </s>
<s> *does* provide this kind of data about properties, so it's not impossible to design or even implement.  </s>
<s> Indeed, this topic has been investigated at length in the group.  </s>
<s> The conclusion we came to is that the issues are so complex and so involved that it merited its own specification.  </s>
<s> Once this last call is done we should start to see proposals for this specification.  </s>
