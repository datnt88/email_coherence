Here's my Config file: indent-attributes:no wrap-attributes:no indent-spaces:10 indent:auto 
in the Meta tags and the Table Tags, I get the following format: td align="Left" valign= "Top" whatever /td I've tried several iterations of the above and it still wraps the last attribute Why is it wrapping the last attribute?

The documentation for the "wrap-attribute" option in HTML Tidy says: "If set to yes, attribute values may be wrapped across lines for easier editing." 
The key is that this option suppresses the wrapping of attribute *values*, not of the entire attribute. 
The option affects whether you get: img src="x" title="This is a long attribute value" or img src="x" title= "This is a long attribute value" (The option perhaps would be more clearly named "wrap-attribute-values".) -- Dave 
add "wrap: 0" to your config file and it should be as you intend: wrap Sets the right margin for line wrapping. 
Tidy tries to wrap lines so that they do not exceed this length. 
The default is 66. Set wrap to zero if you want to disable line wrapping.
