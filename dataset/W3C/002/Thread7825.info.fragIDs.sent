<s> In a number of your comments, you suggest that we use the expression "blind response" to characterize the 302 that you get back from a redirect reference resource.  </s>
<s> Can you say more about what you are trying to convey with "blind"?  </s>
<s> In this message, it looks as if it is supposed to contrast with the 302 you would get back from a non-redirect-reference-resource.  </s>
<s> How is one of these responses more blind than the other?  </s>
<s> Or perhaps I'm just off on the wrong track altogether.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> The term "blind response" is meant to convey the idea that the redirect resource, once it determined that there isn't a pass-through header, blindly, without any thought, responds with a 302.  </s>
<s> I introduce the "blind response" phrase to pull away from the "automatic response" phrase because the "automatic response" phrase gives me the idea that rather than return a 302 the resource will actually act as a sort of proxy for the request and forward it itself to the target and return the response.  </s>
