<s> I have two comments on section 6.3 of #canonical-form 1) suggest add the following additional rule: + For URIs following the generic syntax produce an abs_path of "/" in preference to omitting the abs_path (this might need an additional example earlier in the doc vs http://example.com/ )  </s>
<s> 2) may it be helpful to explicitly extend the rule: "Only perform percent-escaping where it is essential.  </s>
<s> " to considerations where the URI is being transported in a way that anticipates IRIs e.g. XML system identifiers - and to discourage %-escaping of non-ASCII chars in such circumstances.  </s>
<s> (I note that XML Namespaces 1.1 is explicit about this: "Because of the risk of confusion between IRIs that would be equivalent if derefenced, the use of %-escaped characters in namespace names is strongly discouraged."  </s>

<s> Probably a good idea.  </s>
<s> I think this is an issue for the IRI spec, not the URI spec.  </s>
<s> There are no non-ASCII chars in URIs as defined by the URI syntax (there can be non-ASCII chars encoded in URIs, but that's not at issue here).  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> No, because such situations do not actually involve URIs until after the IRI normalization is completed.  </s>
<s> I would (and do) strongly discourage the use of IRIs for namespaces.  </s>
<s> Any identifier that is primarily intended for machine consumption should be constructed for maximum interoperability.  </s>
