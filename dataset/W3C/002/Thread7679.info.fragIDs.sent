<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> I don't have a strong preference on whether we should create a new status code for lack of support for remote connections.  </s>
<s> At some point we might find we need one.  </s>
<s> Anyway.... the status code that you're suggesting doesn't seem to suggest anything except that the server can't do it.  </s>
<s> Can't we just use 500 for that?  </s>
<s> And if so, shouldn't we mention 500 it in the spec?  </s>
<s> Or is 500 too obvious to mention?  </s>
<s> I don't have a strong commitment to 507 either, but for what it's worth the rationale was that any creation of a cross-server binding requires out-of-band collaboration between the servers.  </s>

<s> OTOH, clients probably don't know where the boundaries between file systems are within the URI namespace so they will have difficulty knowing which bindings are allowed and which aren't if a machine refuses to create bindings across file systems.  </s>
<s> In other words, they can't take much action in the situation that Yaron mentioned so for the time being, there's probably not much point in using anything other than 500 in the situation he mentioned  </s>
<s> I agree with Yaron here.  </s>
<s> mod_dav allows the server to operate against different backends.  </s>
<s> It will not be possible to create bindings between namespaces that map to different backends.  </s>

<s> My point is that the binding could fail not due to cross-server anything but an intra-server something.  </s>
<s> That is why I brought up the FrontPage example.  </s>
<s> If you try to bind between volumes it will fail.  </s>
<s> Yet given the current definition FrontPage could not use a 507 in that case.  </s>
<s> That just seems broken.  </s>
<s> That is why I wanted to widen the language so it could cover the cross-volume scenario.  </s>
