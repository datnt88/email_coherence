<s> Is there available anywhere an open source example of using webdav to retrieve files through a browser and seemlessly work with them using a client application - word perfect or ms word.  </s>
<s> Then, be able to save these files with same type of interface one would experience as if saving to local disk?  </s>
<s> Here I want to repeat my question again.  </s>
<s> Suppose I edit a WebDAV file with my application.  </s>
<s> - Now I want to save it.  </s>
<s> In a "normal" application I have "save" and "save as".  </s>
<s> - With a WebDAV file I guess I have "save local", "save on server", "save local as"  </s>
<s> and "save on server as".  </s>
<s> - I think "save local as" doesn't make that much sense and can be dropped.  </s>
<s> - This leaves me with three choices.  </s>
<s> One should be default and be called save.  </s>
<s> - So my idea is to have "save", "save WebDAV" and "save WebDAV as" which means  </s>
<s> a simple "save" means saving local.  </s>
<s> This could be fine for people with a slow  </s>
<s> server connection.  </s>
<s> So do you think this sounds right for a user ?  </s>
<s> Would you prefer other names or choices for saving ?  </s>
<s> I know this isn't something the spec should say but nevertheless it would be nice  </s>
<s> if users would have similar menu items for saving in their upcoming WebDAV empowered  </s>
<s> applications.  </s>
<s> BTW for versioning I have at the moment in a directory window the following  </s>
<s> menu items and subitems: - Version Do  </s>
<s> - Checkin (Which does a VERSION-CONTROL, BASELINE-CONTROL or CHECKIN depending  </s>
<s> on it's target) - Uncheckout - Checkout - Update - Version Report - Version (For a resource or a configuration) - History (For a resource or a configuration) - Baseline Compare Naturally most of these points also can be added to an editor menu.  </s>
<s> Also there  </s>
<s> could be one versioning menu.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Edgar  </s>
<s> I'd suggest just using "save" and "save as" to mean "save local"  </s>
<s> and "save local as" and have "checkin" mean "save to the server (and create a new version if the server supports versioning)".  </s>

<s> That makes sense ... in fact, an interoperable client could have the following logic: - if local storage is available, provide a "save" and "save as" operation.  </s>
<s> - if the WebDAV server is available: - if the resource is under version control, provide a "checkin" operation - otherwise; provide a "publish" operation Note: we are defining client design issues, rather than protocol issues, but since the mailing list has been rather quiet and there are a lot of client implementors on this list, I think this is reasonably on-topic (if anyone disagrees, please let me or the list know).  </s>
