<s> Last change: 2001 Sep 17 VIM REFERENCE MANUAL by Charles E. Campbell, Jr. 1. Network-Oriented File Transfer *netrw-xfer* Network-oriented file transfer under Vim is implemented by a VimL-based script ( netrw.vim ) using plugin techniques.  </s>
<s> It currently supports both reading and writing across networks using rcp, scp, ftp, or ftp+ .netrc as appropriate.  </s>
<s> http is currently supported read-only.  </s>
<s> For rcp, scp, and http, one can use network-oriented file transfer transparently: vim rcp://machine/path vim scp://machine/path Reading Writing Uses * rcp://machine/path * rcp://machine/path rcp :Nread rcp://machine/path :Nwrite rcp://machine/path rcp * scp://machine/path * scp://machine/path scp :Nread scp://machine/path :Nwrite scp://machine/path scp (**) * ftp://machine/path * ftp://machine/path ftp :Nread ftp://machine/path :Nwrite ftp://machine/path ftp+*** :Nread machine path :Nwrite machine path ftp+.netrc :Nread machine uid pass path :Nwrite machine uid pass path ftp (for ftp, "machine" may be machine#port if a different port is needed than the standard ftp port) * http://machine/path wget :Nread http://machine/path wget (*) transparent file transfer: i.e. vim rcp://machine/path :r ftp://machine/path :w ftp://machine/path (**) For an absolute path use scp://machine//path.  </s>

<s> I'm no expert, but the document RFC 2718 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2718.txt)  </s>
<s> recommends that: 2.1.2 Improper use of "//" following " scheme :" Contrary to some examples set in past years, the use of double slashes as the first component of the scheme-specific-part of a URL is not simply an artistic indicator that what follows is a URL: Double slashes are used ONLY when the syntax of the URL's scheme- specific-part contains a hierarchical structure as described in RFC 2396.  </s>
<s> In URLs from such schemes, the use of double slashes indicates that what follows is the top hierarchical element for a naming authority.  </s>
<s> (See section 3 of RFC 2396 for more details.) URL schemes which do not contain a conformant hierarchical structure in their scheme-specific-part should not use double slashes following the " scheme :" string.  </s>
<s> I think that the use of double slashes in "scp://machine//path" is improper, according to the above suggestion.  </s>
