<s> I still don't like the fact that this document is a superset of pubrules, as this kind of duplication may lead to inconsistencies and two different standards to end up with.  </s>
<s> I think this manual should become the reference, with a clear indication of what is MUST, what is SHOULD and what is MAY, and I encourage you to use a checkpoint style with level of priorities like the WAI guidelines (P1 for MUST, level AA, etc).  </s>
<s> Pubrules would just become the LevelA.  </s>
<s> This would make the conformance requirement much clearer.  </s>
<s> I found the statement in 2. "Conformance to this manual is optional and unlike in previous versions, there are no conformance requirements."  </s>
<s> followed by a bunch of must quite confusing.  </s>
<s> The rest is less important: I think it'd be better to put all the copyright/ipr in one section instead of two as now.  </s>
<s> You should refer to this doc instead of the odoriferous css as a good example (and maybe making it a note).  </s>
<s> You should add a direct link to a list of authoring tools that support XMLspec (free or commercial).  </s>
<s> Where is the Manual Of Style linked from ?  </s>
<s> Your timing is great.  </s>
<s> Susan Lesch and I discussed this yesterday.  </s>
<s> Here is our plan, to be executed as soon as we have time: - No rules in pubrules will appear in the manual of style.  </s>
<s> There will be links from the m.o.s. to pubrules.  </s>
<s> - There will be no notion of conformance to the m.o.s.  </s>
<s> We will replace things like "You must have correct spelling" with "Spell-check your document."  </s>
<s> Why no notion of conformance?  </s>
<s> There's no prize or penalty for conforming!  </s>
<s> We'll just say what good things to do are.  </s>
