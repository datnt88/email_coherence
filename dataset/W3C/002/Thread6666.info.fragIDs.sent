<s> Good Morning, I am the Webmaster of a Penn State Web site, and we have purchased a new tool to assist us with keeping our site ADA compliant.  </s>
<s> The new tool is telling us that we need to "clarify natural language".  </s>
<s> We have the following code at the top of all of our Web pages: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"  </s>
<s> It was our understanding that this code clarified our natural language.  </s>
<s> Could you advise us if we need to make revisions to this code?  </s>
<s> I greatly appreciate your assistance.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>

<s> Hi Tammy, The "EN" in the DOCTYPE refers to the natural language of the document type definition, not the content of the document itself.  </s>
<s> In HTML, you can specify the language of attribute values and element content with the "lang" attribute.  </s>
