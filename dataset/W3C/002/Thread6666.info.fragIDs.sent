Good Morning, I am the Webmaster of a Penn State Web site, and we have purchased a new tool to assist us with keeping our site ADA compliant. 
The new tool is telling us that we need to "clarify natural language". 
We have the following code at the top of all of our Web pages: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd" 
It was our understanding that this code clarified our natural language. 
Could you advise us if we need to make revisions to this code? 
I greatly appreciate your assistance. 
Thank you.

Hi Tammy, The "EN" in the DOCTYPE refers to the natural language of the document type definition, not the content of the document itself. 
In HTML, you can specify the language of attribute values and element content with the "lang" attribute.
