Hi everyone This is Kojiro Wakabayashi from NTT. 
This is the first time to post this ML so, I will apologize in advance in case of posting unappropriate subjects. 
I am wondering that whether webDAV is expected to protect some image files (ex. 
GIF, Jpeg...) for not copying and delivering them with no allowance. 
Is this topic covered by webDAV ?

If I understand your question correctly, I think the answer is "no". 
WebDAV will not be providing any form of copy protection for images or other resources on a web site. 
A future extension of WebDAV will be providing the 
ability to set and retrieve "Access Control Lists" which can restrict access to a resource, but I doubt this will be based on allowances, etc, or have copy protection provisions.
