<s> Implication: If you want to use XPtr and get content returned through DOM that means you can't do null-level canonicalization.  </s>

<s> * Consensus: we need the syntax for our XPtr extraction, so if we can do it and do it fast, maybe it'll go in the core, otherwise lets plan to make it part of the manifest spec.  </s>
<s> * Reagle: We may need to look to something else if the DOM dependencies become too great, but for now, lets push forward with this.  </s>

<s> ACTION SIMON: will send up something today with the issues he is encountering.  </s>
<s> Reagle post-facto thinking: It seems we are toying with a couple of variables with respect to extract, Xptr, DOM, and core versus some other spec.  </s>
<s> 1. Reagle wants to keep the core small and easy since we need to start implementing in about a month's time.  </s>
<s> Argues for removing Xptr/extract to manifest level and only permitting simple URIs at the higher level.  </s>
<s> 2. Solo wants symmetry between the signature reference and manifest reference, such that one could use either without the signature breaking.  </s>
<s> This argues for core and manifest references to look alike.  </s>
<s> 3. Boyer wants the ability to force the client to validate the thing actually being signed.  </s>
<s> You can only do this by placing it in the object.  </s>
<s> If you place it in the manifest, its up to the application to decide what to validate, Boyer lost his ability to define what is critical.  </s>
<s> (Reagle reconsiders the idea of flags in the manifest which state whether the resource needs to be checked or not so as to achieve point 1.) Also, if you reference the actual resource (instead of a manifest) in the object, then you naturally need Xptr to extract from it, which conflicts with point 1. 4. [7]Don's doesn't seem to think exclude tags are out of contention.  </s>

<s> * ACTION REAGLE: Respond to [8]Don's comments on RD, tweak for changes in work and post a new version to list before advancing to Information RFC and such.  </s>
<s> Status of Data Model document?  </s>
<s> * The core will need a very simple data model.  </s>
<s> The more extensive data model of the manifest package will be captured in the Manifest/Package XML Application document.  </s>
<s> * Eastlake: I was calling the document the "auxiliary document" in contract to the "core".  </s>
<s> Reagle, I think the Manifest/Package should be its own little XMLspec with a namespace..  </s>
<s> Is there going to be a separate Processing Rules?  </s>

<s> The issue here is not size but entropy.  </s>
<s> XML's verbosity provides nothing usefull here.  </s>
<s> The particular concern for a dictionary attack however is in the area of confidentiality.  </s>
<s> If there is little entropy in the message then I can build a dictionary - regarless of whether the message is a binary digit or XML HEAD TITLE YES /TITLE /HEAD /XML .  </s>
<s> This is why sensible cryptographers employ session keys even when using symmetric keying for distribution.  </s>
<s> The attack of particular concern here is a replay attack.  </s>
<s> I can record your last signed message and replay it.  </s>
<s> This problem is not affected by message size in the way that the dictionary attack is.  </s>
<s> In general concerns of this nature are the responsibility of those proposing the low level packaging formats.  </s>
<s> PKCS#1.1 is designed to be very robust and is pretty much immune to attacks of this type which were considered in its design.  </s>

<s> I don't think this is our problem.  </s>
<s> If you are receiving a complete XML document over some channel where a variety of encodings can be used, you need the " ?" at the beginning to figure it out.  </s>
<s> If you have or receive a part of an XML document then you had better already know the encoding.  </s>
<s> A partial document where you don't know the encoding doesn't work the way XML is defined.  </s>
<s> This is not our problem.  </s>
<s> It's part of XML.  </s>
<s> On the ID question, is this actually relavent for anything other than fragments?  </s>
<s> If there are standard auxiliary documents affecting meaning that are pointed to out of an XML document, the best thing would be a canonicalization algorithm that incorporated the auxiliary document into the main document so it could all be treated as a single entity.  </s>
<s> As others have pointed out, a dictionary attack pertains primarily to confidentiality which we are not doing.  </s>
<s> But the effort to add an optional nonce with ANY content seems pretty trivial.  </s>
<s> I continue to believe that a canoncialization based on DOM should be the default.  </s>
<s> Anyone that does processing of any significance on XML will do something very much like parsing it into a DOM tree.  </s>
<s> It's fine if some people want null or minimal canonicalization but they are not really dealing with XML, just with binary character data that happens to be XML.  </s>
<s> If you want to do extraction from character data, I would think you should be using an awk script or something, not XPointer.  </s>
<s> I don't think I'm pushing "exclude tags", just the idea of elements that can, for applications that need this, be sprinkled into XML to act as markers for use in Xpoint/Xpath/whatever extraction.  </s>
<s> There are people who want to do really lightweight stuff for simple protocols.  </s>
<s> It doesn't seem reasonable that they should be burdened with a requirement to implement XPointer.  </s>
<s> I understand that it allows separate update/evolution but I'm not sure the complexity of an additional namespace is worth it.  </s>
