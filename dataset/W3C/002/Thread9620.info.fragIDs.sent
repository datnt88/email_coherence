<s> We have containers that have ordered selectors, ie the ordering is built into the very syntax of the selectors.  </s>
<s> So the containers simply *are* ordered in any RDF interpretation, whether we want to treat that order as significant or not.  </s>
<s> So we cannot make rdf:bags into unordered entities in the RDF model theory.  </s>
<s> That would work for me.  </s>
<s> If this is acceptable then it is trivial to add rdf:seq and rdf:bag to the MT. I've already written the relevant section.  </s>
<s> (Adding rdf:Alt to the MT is something else altogether: I would suggest that we simply abandon rdf:Alt.)  </s>
<s> Could we pull a similar stunt with Alt as with Bag.  </s>
<s> An Alt is simply bag with a hint that applications might consider the first element as different from the others, i.e. the model theory ignores the semantics of Alt.  </s>
<s> Oh well, sure, if we ignore the semantics then we can do anything.  </s>
<s> The problem with Alt is that if you follow the, er, hint, then your conclusions actually *contradict* valid RDF conclusions, ie in this sense Alt is nonmonotonic.  </s>

<s> Well, it will make it nonconformant, at any rate.  </s>
<s> Well, its not clear that it is safer in the long run.  </s>
<s> After all, the actual CODE will still work, right?  </s>

<s> That will break anything that's used it.  </s>
<s> It seems clear to me.  </s>
<s> Experiemental explanatory text: A resource of type rdf:Alt is an ordered collection.  </s>
<s> A collection may be given the type rdf:Alt, as opposed to rdf:Bag or rdf:Seq, as a hint to the reader that typical processing by an application will be to select one member of the collection for processing.  </s>
<s> For example, a schema designer might use rdf:Alt to represent the collection of mirror sites from which a file may be downloaded.  </s>
<s> In all respects, other than this hint, a resource of type rdf:Alt is just like an rdf:Seq.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Sounds good to me.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> That will break anything that's used it.  </s>
<s> I'm happy with that.  </s>
<s> Final sentence might be rephrased along the lines: RDF however supports no formal entailments that reflect such hints, and considers rdf:Alt to be simply a class of ordered containers.  </s>
