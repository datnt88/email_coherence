<s> Hi folks, The following is a proposal for an alternative solution meeting the goals of urn: URIs but with http: URIs so that the full richness of the web architecture can be exploited.  </s>
<s> (sincerest apologies to all the folks who have worked long  </s>
<s> and hard on DDDS... perhaps now to no avail) The combination of HTTP, PURLs, URIQA and a new top level domain make for a powerful solution that completely eliminates any need for the urn: URI scheme, or anything similar, as  </s>
<s> well as provides an immediate migratory path for all urn: schemes to http: URIs.  </s>
<s> The long term integrity of URN schemes are dependent on the longevity of the managing authority, though one would also hope that URNs would remain valid long after a given managing authority has ceased to exist and mint new URNs for that scheme.  </s>
<s> The greatest argument for urn: URIs over http: URIs is that  </s>
<s> (a) domain names do not last forever and and if the managing authority changes, the function and meaning of URIs grounded in that domain might change or become ambiguous; and (b) domain names reflect legal entities that one may not wish  </s>
<s> reflected in ones URI, if the denote resources that can be transferred to new owners.  </s>
<s> Well, this can be addressed with a very simple solution.  </s>
<s> I propose that a new top level domain .urn  </s>
<s> should be defined, managed by the same folks that manage the registration of urn: subschemes, whereby for any URN subscheme urn:X: there would rather be issued a subdomain X.urn.  </s>
<s> Then, the managing authority of that subdomain can mint http: URIs (URNs) based on that subdomain (regardless as to any services that might be offered by any web server operating in that subdomain).  </s>
<s> Thus rather than, e.g. urn:issn:1560-1560 you'd have something like  </s>
<s> and the need for solutions such as DDDS disappears, since HTTP now does the job quite nicely.  </s>
<s> The managing authority for the ISSN URN scheme could then host a server at http://issn.urn to provide access to representations  </s>
<s> and descriptions of the resources, or simply information about the owner of the URI -- or even nothing, which is no worse than present urn: URIs now.  </s>
<s> And since domains can be subdivided, and subpaths of URIs redirected to entirely different servers, the managing authority has a tremendous amount of flexibility in how it organizes its namespace and services provided for accessing representations and descriptions of the resources denoted by the URNs in question.  </s>
<s> A given managing authority could simply maintain a PURL like redirection service to customer-specific URIs, providing a consistent, opaque point of access to the resource that is nevertheless managed by the resource owner.  </s>
<s> E.g. if Example Inc. was issued ISSN 1560-1560, then an HTTP request to could be automatically redirected to providing exactly the functionality that DDDS promises, but using the existing and proven web infrastructure.  </s>
<s> If Example Inc. later transferred ownership of that resource to e.g. Wombat Inc. then the redirection could be redefined to something like etc. and agents would continue to interact with the resource in terms of its HTTP-URN transparently, with no manditory impact from the change in ownership.  </s>
<s> This solution also allows URIQA to be used for obtaining descriptions of such HTTP-URN denoted resources in a standardized manner, since in the same way as requests for representations would be redirected to the customer-specific servers, likewise, requests for descriptions would also be redirected.  </s>
<s> Note that the creation of the .urn  </s>
<s> top level domain is based purely on practical considerations, not technical ones, as this HTTP+PURL+URIQA approach will work equally well regardless of the domain name.  </s>
<s> Creating the top level domain .urn  </s>
<s> also allows for every URN subscheme now in existence to immediately be provided an HTTP resolvable namespace which has a regular transformation from the URN structure, allowing agents to work effectively with legacy content containing urn: URIs.  </s>
<s> Thus, the mapping urn:X:Y - http://X.urn/Y  </s>
<s> becomes a poor-man's DDDS.  </s>
<s> And this approach likely has application to a number of other URI schemes as well... Simple.  </s>
<s> Eh? Cheers, Patrick Patrick Stickler Nokia, Finland patrick.stickler@nokia.com  </s>
<s> No, it really cannot.  </s>
<s> I know of several cases where they point to different resources, and many cases where one points to a resource and the other does not.  </s>
<s> Perhaps actually different representations, rather than different resources.  </s>
<s> I.e. both URIs denote the same resource, but there may be a different set of representations accessible via one than the other.  </s>
<s> Further, they are clearly functionally different as protocol elements; the difference between them makes a fundamental assertion about how to engage in protocol processing.  </s>
<s> Er. Right.  </s>
<s> Like I said, the 's' in https: is a processing instruction that results in different behavior from the server.  </s>
<s> Insofar as denotation is concerned, that 's' is semantically (though not lexically) transparent.  </s>
<s> Insofar as resolution of that URI by an HTTP server, that 's' has semantics relevant to the resolution protocol, just as most of the other structural components of a URI do.  </s>
<s> One can denote the same resource with an http: URI, an  </s>
<s> https: URI, a urn: URI, an ftp: URN, etc. and insofar as the denotation is concerned, those URIs are opaque.  </s>
<s> However, http: and https: URIs have IMO a special relation in that whereas other lexical distinctions between two  </s>
<s> URIs might correspond to a difference in denotation, alternation  </s>
<s> between the http: and https: schemes for the otherwise lexically equivalent URIs cannot and does not result in any difference in denotation.  </s>
<s> Any URI https://X denotes the very same resource as  </s>
<s> the URI http://X, even if there may be representations that might be accessible via https://X that are not accessible via http://X, or visa versa.  </s>
<s> In that way, https: is a pretty odd fish.  </s>
<s> Ultimately, when resolving an HTTP-URN to a representation, a server somewhere will return an entity in its response corresponding to a representation of the resource denoted by the URI provided in the original request; and if it is a well behavied server, will specify in the response a URI denoting the representation itself, if it is an entity distinct from that denoted by the original URI.  </s>
<s> You seem to be working from the assumption that if two identifiers resolve to the same resource at the end of this processing, they were the same identifier.  </s>
<s> No. I don't assert that.  </s>
<s> Not for arbitrary pairs of URIs.  </s>
<s> Only for pairs of URIs which differ only in the alternation of the http: and https: schemes.  </s>
<s> That's not true, and it has been discussed to death.  </s>
<s> If that's not what you mean, I don't think you're being clear (and, again, I think the way to be clear here is to write a draft specifying the mechanisms in full)  </s>
<s> Well, I can try to be clearer.  </s>
<s> It may also be the case that you are not reading my posts carefully enough.  </s>
<s> I could found a company today, grab some domain such as .urn.org and begin charging money for subdomains such as issn.urn.org and also sell the software needed to manage the namespaces and redirection mappings.  </s>
<s> T  </s>
<s> Sure, and if you want to found one, go ahead.  </s>
<s> You'll need to build the trust of your customers that your resolution mechanisms work better than and will return the same answers as the mechanisms already specified, but that's up to you and your marketing department.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> My point was simply that there is no *technical* obsticle or flaw in my proposal, insofar as a common base domain for the management of the URN namespace is concerned.  </s>
<s> It's simply political/practical/organizational/beaurocratic.  </s>
<s> For the sake of assurred perpetuity of URNs, it would be best all around if the base domain were owned/managed by the same organization now managing registration of urn: subschemes, and that the registration of subdomains would follow the same process as for urn: subschemes, with no cost incurred, no chance of losing ownership of the subdomain due to e.g. failed payment, etc. and no risk of reuse of a subdomain if a subdomain owner ceases to function/exist.  </s>
<s> writing it up as an ID with a full specification is a good first step.  </s>
<s> Well, I think putting it on the table for informal discussion is a good first step.  </s>
<s> My informal response is "this has no obvious advantages over the DDDS proposal,  </s>
<s> Eh? You don't consider the possiblity of immediate access to representations using existing HTTP machinery an advantage?!  </s>
<s> has strong flavors of things that have been discussed and rejected,  </s>
<s> You appear to be reading those things into my posts (and I'm not sure an ID would alleviate that problem.  </s>
<s> It might.  </s>
<s> and isn't well specified."  </s>
<s> An ID is certainly an expected subsequent step.  </s>
<s> That would help, thanks.  </s>
<s> To be honest, given the simplicity of the idea, I'm not sure how its specification could be expanded upon to any great extent.  </s>
<s> Granted, I've not taken a historical tour and related it to every possible alternative...  </s>
<s> I do, though, plan to work up an ID in the coming weeks.  </s>
<s> Patrick Patrick Stickler Nokia, Finland patrick.stickler@nokia.com  </s>
<s> I've been on vacation and blissfully ignoring this thread but this had to be corrected....  </s>
<s> No, it really cannot.  </s>
<s> I know of several cases where they point to different resources, and many cases where one points to a resource and the other does not.  </s>
<s> You are simply and flatly wrong here.  </s>
<s> By using the term 'resource' in this context without clarification most will assume you are using the term in its RFC 2396 sense.  </s>
<s> If you aren't then please say so since its a very important distinction.  </s>
<s> If you have two URIs then you, by  </s>
<s> definition, have two distinctly different Resources.  </s>
<s> You personally may have some knowledge outside the web or within some particular application of it that suggests these two Resources may be considered equivalent according to that _other_ set of rules, but in so far as the web and URIs are concerned, there really are two separate resources.  </s>
<s> Especially since one is included in an SSL session that is signed by a certificate.  </s>
<s> In today's world there are many communities that would consider the unsigned one to be downright dangerous.  </s>
<s> Further, they are clearly functionally different as protocol elements; the difference between them makes a fundamental assertion about how to engage in protocol processing.  </s>
<s> Wrong. Very very very wrong.  </s>
<s> In a security minded world it is most definitely _NOT_ transparent.  </s>
<s> This last paragraph is so wrong as to be very dangerous to even post on a official list for the discussion of URIs.  </s>
<s> Please clarify your statement and reconcile it with RFC 2396 because on its face it violates the standard.  </s>
<s> Ultimately, when resolving an HTTP-URN to a representation, a server somewhere will return an entity in its response corresponding to a representation of the resource denoted by the URI provided in the original request; and if it is a well behavied server, will specify in the response a URI denoting the representation itself, if it is an entity distinct from that denoted by the original URI.  </s>
<s> You seem to be working from the assumption that if two identifiers resolve to the same resource at the end of this processing, they were the same identifier.  </s>
<s> That was never defined for 'https' and in practice is not the case.  </s>
<s> The fact that access to one Resource is signed and one isn't means that no matter the claims to the contrary, those are two different Resources.  </s>
<s> That's not true, and it has been discussed to death.  </s>
<s> If that's not what you mean, I don't think you're being clear (and, again, I think the way to be clear here is to write a draft specifying the mechanisms in full)  </s>
<s> Nope. We've read 'em carefully.  </s>
<s> You're not the first to suggest this approach.  </s>
<s> It's been suggested at least three times going back to '92.  </s>

<s> For your simplistic view of it, yes.  </s>
<s> But those that manage namespaces with much wider deployments than your needs have already determined that it is insufficient.  </s>
<s> All you're doing is encoding the first rule of the DDDS for the URI  </s>
<s> Resolution Application.  </s>
<s> And many have determined that there is a need to go beyond it due to the fact that while the namespace may be unchanged,  </s>
<s> the delegation rules may change over time.  </s>
<s> You are requiring that those delegation rules only be expressible within one single (aggregate) HTTP server, using the mechanisms found only within HTTP 1.1 and that simply isn't workable.  </s>

<s> There was even a proposal many years ago called WIRE that attempted to use 30x redirects to do a style of DDDS resolution that ended up being extremely convoluted.  </s>
<s> Do you think we rejected HTTP due to some inherent 'not invented here' syndrome?  </s>
