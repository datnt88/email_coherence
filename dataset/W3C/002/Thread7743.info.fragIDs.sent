Hi all, FYI, Zope appears to work well with IE5 (web folders), and handles GET, HEAD, PUT, PROPFIND, DELETE, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE requests as expected. 
It apparently doesnt deal with custom properties. 
If you want to try out IE5 against Zope, you can open a "web folder" (read only) at: A few observations / nits: o I agree with Greg that IE5 Web Folders seem a bit slow... 
o IE5 sends a rather curious looking propfind request: 
I'm curious what these elements are: 
...I don't see them in the spec, yet IE5 is asserting them to be in the 'DAV:' namespace. 
Are these revenants of an older draft, or from other works-in-progress (adv. 
collections, etc.)?

I saw this, too, but knew it was going to be there before looking :-) Put 2 and 2 together: Lisa Lippert and Alex Hopmann (both of Microsoft) have authored an Internet Draft for "Additional WebDAV Collection Properties". 
Please see the URL: 
The I.D. covers defaultdocument, iscollection, ishidden, and isstructureddocument. 
This does leave the status of name, parentname, isreadonly, contentclass, lastaccessed, and isroot up in the air. 
I can guess at several of them, but it would be nice if MSFT could document them. 
Part work in progress. 
Part "aggressive use" of the DAV: namespace :-) Hrm. 
Looks like I need to get the property registry set up on webdav.org... Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/ 
Interesting - IE5 does not appear to be willing to follow a 302 (Found) redirect when it does it's initial OPTIONS request to the server... sigh . 
It does not seem very 
tolerant in its interpretation of response codes - I've noticed that it will also fail if the server returns a 204 (No Content) instead of a 200 OK in response to an OPTIONS request. 
That means you'll have to include the port number in the url to open the public area with IE: Brian Lloyd brian@digicool.com

I was wondering about this - it's annoying, but is there any way round it? 
2068 says you can't automatically follow the redirect, and you can't cache it... so you'd have to prompt the user for each new request?

Hi Brian, Nop It still do not Work. 
Here is my config IE 5 Release version (downloaded it yesterday). 
Win98. 
Here is what I got with the lates link you provided (including the port number) 03/19/99 10:57:45 Could not find a web server at 'webdav.zope.org' on port 2518. 
Please check to make sure that the web server name is valid and your proxy settings are set correctly. 
If you are sure that everything is correct, the web server may be temporarily out of service.

Yes, we can document those as well, we did start the process with the collection properties draft. 
The process is a little confusing right now, though.

Excellent. 
I might also request if the draft could specify which properties "should" be considered live and provide an example of how a server might supply/restrict them. 
I'd very much like to support as many live props as possible, to assist IE5's operation.
