<s> Hi all, FYI, Zope appears to work well with IE5 (web folders), and handles GET, HEAD, PUT, PROPFIND, DELETE, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE requests as expected.  </s>
<s> It apparently doesnt deal with custom properties.  </s>
<s> If you want to try out IE5 against Zope, you can open a "web folder" (read only) at: A few observations / nits: o I agree with Greg that IE5 Web Folders seem a bit slow...  </s>
<s> o IE5 sends a rather curious looking propfind request:  </s>
<s> I'm curious what these elements are:  </s>
<s> ...I don't see them in the spec, yet IE5 is asserting them to be in the 'DAV:' namespace.  </s>
<s> Are these revenants of an older draft, or from other works-in-progress (adv.  </s>
<s> collections, etc.)?  </s>

<s> 2068 says you can't automatically follow the redirect, and you can't cache it... so you'd have to prompt the user for each new request?  </s>

<s> I might also request if the draft could specify which properties "should" be considered live and provide an example of how a server might supply/restrict them.  </s>
<s> I'd very much like to support as many live props as possible, to assist IE5's operation.  </s>
