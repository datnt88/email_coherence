<s> Hi, all,  </s>
<s> We have an XML application case for password-based HMAC (http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#hmac-sha1)  </s>
<s> We need to compute a secret key from a password, salt and iteration count first (for dictionary attack) and then feed this secret key to the HMAC defined in XML DSIG.  </s>
<s> The question is where we will store this salt and iteration count.  </s>
<s> It makes more sense for me to store them within the signature node but I did not find any proper place in XML DSIG Signature node.  </s>
<s> Does XML DSIG not support this?  </s>
<s> If so, we may have to store them within application entities.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>

<s> Hi Steve, what about ds:SignatureMethod Algorithm="http://www.entegrity.com/#password-hmac-sha1" xmlns:entegrity="http://www.entegrity.com/#"  </s>
<s> Regards, Christian  </s>
<s> Or you can put this information into an Object element if you are just going to specify the http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#hmac-sha1 algorithm and omit KeyInfo.  </s>
<s> Or you could create a custom KeyInfo child that has your iteration and salt info.  </s>

<s> I answered Joseph &amp; Dwight privately already, but "for the record" let me state it here so that Joseph can update the Microsoft column in the interop table.  </s>
<s> What's currently in the table is indeed correct for the implementation of XMLDSIG that we shipped as part of v1 of the .NET  </s>
<s> Framework/Visual Studio .NET.  </s>
<s> The items that have * by them (which indicated that the feature was in post-Beta 2  builds) no longer need stars; those features are supported in what we shipped final (all the HMAC-SHA1 stuff).  </s>
<s> To answer Dwight's specific question, yes, we do support the #xpointer(/) and #xpointer(id("ID")) syntax in v1 of the .NET  </s>
<s> Framework, but we don't have general xpointer support.  </s>
<s> (We special-cased those two expressions in our code; full xpointer support in XMLDSIG is dependent on full xpointer support being added to the .NET  </s>
<s> Framework in general...) As always, feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions about the .NET  </s>
<s> Framework implementation.  </s>
