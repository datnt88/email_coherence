<s> Organization: W3C Subject: Publiation Rules Change: Copyright notice changes on Technical Reports X-Archived-At: http://www.w3.org/mid/3E1C66FE.3060003@w3.org  </s>
<s> Hello, Chairs.  </s>
<s> This is a notification of a pubrules change, effective immediately.  </s>
<s> It is a change in Rule 1.7 [0], item 10: "The copyright must use the following markup."  </s>
<s> With the change of European host and the change of Gregorian Calendar year, the copyright notice for all technical reports has changed.  </s>
<s> The new markup includes the correct year, the correct markup for ERCIM, and short name links for the various W3C Policy documents.  </s>
<s> You'll find the new markup included in Publication Rules itself, as well as in the TR template [1].  </s>
<s> The pubrules checker is also being updated at this time.  </s>
<s> Unlike other pubrules changes, we do need to implement this immediately, as it is related to copyright.  </s>
<s> Both Henri, our Webmaster, and I are here to help you with any questions you may have on this change.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your attention, and best wishes for a productive 2003.  </s>

<s> I am not sure what variation of the style sheet we use, but the patch should hopefully apply cleanly on most versions: Regards, Hugo Hugo Haas - W3C  </s>
