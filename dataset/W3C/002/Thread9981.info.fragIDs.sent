I'm getting the impression that publishing process is a bit fraught and error prone e.g. getting the right links to the right docs in TR space. 
Am I right? 
Any suggestions for how to make it easier on ourselves?

Yes ... for last call .. 1: we publish a pre-Last Call just for getting all the docs in place, a week before we go to last call. 
We fix the links in that last week. 
Status of this Document reads "This is an editors' release. 
Public comment is not invited at this time" 2: During last few weeks we have all the editors' drafts on a single machine, as if they were already deployed, and we have a final edit that is a global substitution across all docs of for 3: We decide the "publication date" for both the pre last call and last call sufficiently in advance.

FWIW, I think the publishing process should not require editors to be experts in HTML. 
I'm not, and have no wish to be. 
Is this unreasonable?
