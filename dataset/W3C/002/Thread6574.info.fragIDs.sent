Dear Sir or Madam 
I use your site on a regular basis and just have one request. 
Would it be possible to rewrite the page on character entities, showing the symbol? 
The current layout makes it extremely hard to search for a numeric entity in a hurry. 
Yours faithfully Lavinia Hyde.

Could you please send the URI of the page? 
If it is part of a specification it couldn't be rewritten, no, but if it is some other page maybe so. 
Or is this the kind of chart you are looking for? 
Thanks for your comments.

Many thanks for your reply. 
The URL is:- 
Ideally I would like to be able to scan the page for, e.g. a pound sign, and find the &amp;#code beside it. 
Many thanks Lavinia Hyde.

Thank you for the URL. 
Your idea has merit but HTML 4.01 is a Recommendation that won't change - W3C specifications are frozen on publication. 
(Were it a Working Draft for example then a change might have been possible in a future version.) 
Try the htmlhelp.com 
charts or I imagine that there are others available. 
Hope this helps.

I agree that would be a handy resource; one finds this in the Unicode specification, for example. 
I was one of the editors of that specification. 
We debated the question of including "live" markup in the spec that would be rendered in people's browsers. 
In the end, we chose not to, because we were concerned that the rendering might be construed as being normative. 
Renderings of character entities may have been less "riskey" than renderings of tables or other markup (for which there is no predefined rendering). 
The type of page you describe should be part of an HTML test suite. 
Anybody know of a good one?
