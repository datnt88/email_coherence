<s> Jan, Thanks for this.  </s>
<s> It could be very useful.  </s>
<s> How about sending it to the list as an html attachement and then we'll have it in the archive to refer to.  </s>

<s> I find great big attachments to be something of a burden... your mention of "apologies" suggests you do too... W3C has a mailing list set up *just* so you can mail stuff* there to get an archive pointer: www-archive@w3.org  </s>
<s> (archived at http://www.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/ ) so my preference would be: send big attachments to www-archive and then send notice (including a pointer) to w3c-rdfcore-wg.  </s>
<s> That's my preference, but I know of some folks that actually prefer to receive copies of documents rather than pointers, so I leave it to the chairs and/or staff contacts to decide which policy, if any, best serves the needs of the group.  </s>
<s> *stuff related to W3C work, that is.  </s>
<s> It only accepts mail from folks that are subscribed to some W3C mailing list.  </s>

<s> Second Dan's preference.  </s>
<s> I frequently like to acquire local copies of documents (for when I'm offline), but the nice thing about getting the pointer in the mail rather than the copy is I get more of a choice about when/whether I download the copy (like, not today, being on a slow line).  </s>
