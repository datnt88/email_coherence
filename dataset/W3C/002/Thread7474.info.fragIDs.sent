<s> Many thanks to Jim Davis for leading the discussion of advanced collection requirements at the LA IETF meeting.  </s>
<s> I would like to arrive at consensus about these requirements and produce another draft by May 15.  </s>
<s> You can find the current draft at: n-reqts-00.txt  </s>
<s> Based on Jim's summary of the IETF discussion ("notes of discussion of requirements for Advanced Collection", 3 Apr 1998), I propose to take the following actions, unless I hear protests from the group: Keep these requirements unchanged: 3.1.1  </s>
<s> - 3.1.8,  </s>
<s> 3.1.10,  </s>
<s> 3.1.12,  </s>
<s> 3.2.5 Keep with minor changes: 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.2.4 Delete the following requirements: 3.1.9  </s>
<s> A referential member of a collection also inherits the properties of the resource it refers to.  </s>
<s> 3.2.6  </s>
<s> It is possible to impose multiple orderings on the same collection.  </s>
<s> 3.2.7  </s>
<s> An ordering is not required to contain all members of the collection.  </s>
<s> 3.2.8  </s>
<s> A collection member may belong to the same ordering more than once.  </s>
<s> Add the following new requirement: N.2 It is possible to request creation of a referential member that the server will guarentee to have referential integrity.  </s>
<s> The following requirements need more discussion: 3.1.11  </s>
<s> Servers are encouraged to maintain referential integrity for referential members as far as possible, but are not required to do so.  </s>
<s> I assume that N.2 above, which Jim reported as having been agreed upon, would replace 3.1.11.  </s>
<s> There was a feeling that 3.1.11  </s>
<s> was too weak for many applications.  </s>
<s> When I proposed 3.1.11,  </s>
<s> I was taking the pragmatic view that in the world of the Web, where references might point to resources on another server in another domain, it would often be impossible for a server to guarantee referential integrity.  </s>
<s> The proposal in N.2 is that it be possible to request that a server guarantee referential integrity when it creates a new referential member.  </s>
<s> When a server receives such a request, if it cannot make the guarantee, the request should fail.  </s>
<s> If N.2 is acceptable to everyone as a replacement for 3.1.11,  </s>
<s> I will make that replacement.  </s>
<s> 3.2.9  </s>
<s> It is possible to modify an existing ordering efficiently.  </s>
<s> The implementation of orderings and operations on them should minimize the number of round trips and the amount of data transferred when modifying an existing orderings.  </s>
<s> This includes cases where a single collection member is inserted into an ordering or removed from an ordering, as well as cases where many collection members are moved to different positions in the ordering.  </s>
<s> The intent here was to avoid any implementation that would have you do things like GET a collection member, DELETE it, and PUT it into the collection again at a different position, just to change the ordering.  </s>
<s> Jim was uncertain of the reasons for dissention about 3.2.9.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we can get them stated again on the mailing list.  </s>
<s> Proposed new requirements that need further discussion: N.1 Operations on a target do not affect the reference(s).  </s>
<s> This is the mirror of 3.1.4,  </s>
<s> which states that operations on a referential member do not affect the resource it references.  </s>
<s> Adding or deleting a referential member or changing its properties has no effect on its target.  </s>
<s> This new requirement states that changing the properties of the target or deleting it has no effect on the reference.  </s>
<s> Now that we have dropped the requirement that a referential members inherit the properties of their targets, this looks more plausible.  </s>
<s> It may be problematic that we are here forbidding servers from having referential members inherit properties from their targets.  </s>
<s> It also looks as if this new requirement conflicts with N.2.  </s>
<s> Suppose the server has undertaken to guarantee referential integrity for a referential member.  </s>
<s> What happens when someone tries to move its target resource?  </s>
<s> Is the server not allowed to update the referential member to point to the new location of the target resource?  </s>
<s> N.3 It is possible to discover whether or not a referential member has such 'integrity protection'.  </s>
<s> This is a follow-on to N.2.  </s>
<s> To me it seems reasonable that once we accept N.2, we should take this next step.  </s>
<s> If we have a mix of members for which referential integrity is guaranteed and members for which it is not, it should be possible to find out which sort a particular member is.  </s>
<s> N.4 Is is possible to discover whether a resource is the target of such a 'protected referential member'.  </s>
<s> Again, it seems reasonable once we've agreed to N.2 to make it possible to find out whether there are any references to a target of a protected referential member.  </s>
<s> Issues raised at LA IETF for discussion: 1) Can one have a reference to a reference?  </s>
<s> It seems reasonable to allow this.  </s>
<s> You can always find out whether the target is itself a reference and, if so, what URI is its target.  </s>
<s> 2) Are circular references possible?  </s>
<s> Of course, once you say "yes" to 1), the consequence is that circular references are possible.  </s>
<s> 3) Can a reference have more than one target (e.g. in content negotiation)?  </s>
<s> I would suggest that a referential member references a single URI.  </s>
<s> If that URI has multiple variants, then the referential member points to that set of variants, and content negotiation would be carried on just as you would expect.  </s>
<s> If the URI identifies a collection, then the referential member points to the collection.  </s>
<s> There was not enough time in LA to discuss the issues list at the end of the requirements draft.  </s>
<s> Here is a reminder of what was on that list: What are we really trying to capture in distinguishing between internal and referential members?  </s>
<s> Are there important differences in functionality that are not captured by these requirements?  </s>
<s> What should be our position on passing requests through to the target of a referential member?  </s>
<s> Never?  </s>
<s> Only for certain operations?  </s>
<s> Provide an option for all / some operations?  </s>
<s> Is there any requirement for unnamed referential members of collections?  </s>
<s> How far should a server be expected to maintain orderings?  </s>
<s> If a member is deleted from a collection, should the server delete it from all orderings?  </s>
<s> Should a server perform all maintenance on orderings, with clients operating on them only indirectly by submitting requests to the server?  </s>

<s> Thank you for sending your scenario.  </s>
<s> I am not quite sure whether we are using the word "ordering" in the same way.  </s>
<s> As it is used in the requirements draft, it refers to the sequencing of resources within a single collection, where a collection is one level of the hierarchy you describe.  </s>
<s> We do allow alternative hierarchies to be defined for the same resources.  </s>
<s> Any resource can be referenced from multiple collections.  </s>
<s> It would certainly be possible to construct the two hierarchies you describe, which reference all of the same resources but organize them in different ways.  </s>
<s> The rationale for dropping the requirement for multiple orderings on a collection was that you can accomplish the same thing by creating multiple collections, each with a single ordering.  </s>
<s> The ordering that is being addressed by the advanced collections requirements is different from sorted search results.  </s>
<s> Although we haven't talked about implementations yet, I think a lot of us have assumed that the ordering would be implemented as a property on the collection, whose value is a list of the URLs of the collection members.  </s>
<s> This ordering might be equivalent to one you could get by sorting based on a metadata value, but it would not have to be.  </s>
<s> For example, I might create an ordering on a collection that was "the best order for a beginner to read the documents in order to develop an understanding of the field", even if there is no property on the resources in the collection that could be sorted on to arrive at this ordering.  </s>
<s> Search based on metadata is being addressed by another closely related group, DASL.  </s>
<s> The mailing list for that group is www-webdav-dasl@w3.org, and their web site is at http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/dasl/ .  </s>
<s> You will find a requirements document there that includes ordering of result sets.  </s>
<s> Although the DASL straw-man protocol does not address ordering, I assume that this will be fixed as the specification evolves.  </s>
<s> I think that the combination of the base DAV specification, the advanced collections specification, and the DASL specification will eventually meet your needs, but if not, we need to make some changes.  </s>
<s> --Judy  </s>
<s> very useful for executing industrial plant projects distributed among many parties.  </s>
<s> If I have not completely misunderstood your work, the concept of collections could be streched to cover an area of interest to industial plant projects namely dynamic hierarchic collection.  </s>
<s> I hope that you taking away the possibility to have multiple orderings of a collection does not kill my scenario.  </s>
<s> The scenario (or an example): Engineering documents of an industrial plant can be ordered into  </s>
<s> hierarchic collections in many ways.  </s>
<s> To give you an example of two possibilities: Physical plant structure: plant - department - process - equipment Document type structure: drawing - electrical - loop diagram - department The first structure is the one a process or maintenence oriented person  </s>
<s> uses and the second one is the one a design engineer uses.  </s>
<s> The user of the system should be able to give the order (any order) of metadata elements that form the hierarchy dynamically.  </s>
<s> There are tens (even hundreds) of thousands of documents in an industrial  </s>
<s> plant project.  </s>
<s> To effectively navigate the mass a dynamic hierachy based on the metadata would be very useful.  </s>
<s> In a sense this is an ordered collection and the same collection has several ordering schemes.  </s>
<s> In addition to the collection members it would be very important to get just the browsing tree from the server (one could ask just for the tree that is the dynamic hierarchy without any members)  </s>
<s> I hope that if this is not a part of the definition, the definition does  </s>
<s> not prohibit (hopefully it supports) the creation of a system that works like this.  </s>

<s> ...documents ... can be ordered into hierarchic collections in many ways.... Physical plant structure: plant - department - process - equipment Document type structure: drawing - electrical - loop diagram - department  </s>
<s> I agree with Judy, and would add only two things: 1) While it is true that "It would certainly be possible to construct the two hierarchies you describe, which reference all of the same resources but organize them in different ways" this would provide only static multiple hierarchies.  </s>
<s> You'd have to do additional work to ensure that any document inserted into one hierarchy was also inserted into the proper place in any others.  </s>
<s> Such work falls outside the scope of WebDAV, however.  </s>
<s> (Perhaps the workflow concepts recently mentioned in passing in this list would be useful though.  </s>
<s> One might ask for a notification to be sent when a resource was added to a collection, and then compute the other collections where it should also be added.  </s>
<s> Likewise for deletions.  </s>
<s> But I digress.) 2) The most recent draft of DASL protocol does provide for orderings.  </s>
<s> So one could achieve the desired dynamic multiple hierarchies by varying the sort parameters.  </s>
<s> How do so such and still get good performance remains to be seen.  </s>
<s> Oh, I should also say that the dynamic multiple hierarchy scenario is a very interesting and relevant one, and I am grateful to have such a clear example of it.  </s>
<s> I think it will be useful in the DASL work.  </s>
<s> Best regards Jim 650-812-4301  </s>
