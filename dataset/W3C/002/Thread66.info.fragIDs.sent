If the author of Tidy finds himself ever in the position of needing to decide between having Tidy 'do the right thing' vs 'support what Microsoft/Netscape/whomever', I do hope that the default behavior will be 'support the published standard' ...

Tidy already doesn't do this (i.e., "support the published standard"), as the published HTML standard has no provision for adding new tags. 
Tidy's "new-xxx-tags" configuration options allow generation of illegal HTML (e.g., it can produce, as output, a file that claims adherence with the HTML 4.01 standard, for example, but will not validate). 
To me, that's in keeping with Tidy's mandate, which is to clean up valid HTML documents and the "pseudo-HTML" produced by programs from Microsoft, Netscape, and others. 
I would modify your suggestion to request that Tidy never produce an invalid HTML document from valid source. 
Clearly, if the source is valid HTML 4.01, for example, then valid HTML 4.01 is what Tidy should produce. 
That is, I would not want a valid page to fail validation after tidying.

Re: ability to include new tags via config file Good point. 
However, _by default_ tidy's configuration doesn't, I believe, include any of the non-standard tags. 
So someone has to take a specific action to get Tidy to deal with something 'invalid'. 
In those cases, Tidy should not generate a DOCTYPE that indicates the page is one of the known standards; instead, perhaps, it should require the user to provide a different doctype, even if that means they have to write one... Larry W. Virden mailto:lvirden@cas.org
