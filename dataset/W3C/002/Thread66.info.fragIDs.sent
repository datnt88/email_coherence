<s> If the author of Tidy finds himself ever in the position of needing to decide between having Tidy 'do the right thing' vs 'support what Microsoft/Netscape/whomever', I do hope that the default behavior will be 'support the published standard' ...  </s>

<s> Tidy already doesn't do this (i.e., "support the published standard"), as the published HTML standard has no provision for adding new tags.  </s>
<s> Tidy's "new-xxx-tags" configuration options allow generation of illegal HTML (e.g., it can produce, as output, a file that claims adherence with the HTML 4.01 standard, for example, but will not validate).  </s>
<s> To me, that's in keeping with Tidy's mandate, which is to clean up valid HTML documents and the "pseudo-HTML" produced by programs from Microsoft, Netscape, and others.  </s>
<s> I would modify your suggestion to request that Tidy never produce an invalid HTML document from valid source.  </s>
<s> Clearly, if the source is valid HTML 4.01, for example, then valid HTML 4.01 is what Tidy should produce.  </s>
<s> That is, I would not want a valid page to fail validation after tidying.  </s>

<s> Re: ability to include new tags via config file Good point.  </s>
<s> However, _by default_ tidy's configuration doesn't, I believe, include any of the non-standard tags.  </s>
<s> So someone has to take a specific action to get Tidy to deal with something 'invalid'.  </s>
<s> In those cases, Tidy should not generate a DOCTYPE that indicates the page is one of the known standards; instead, perhaps, it should require the user to provide a different doctype, even if that means they have to write one... Larry W. Virden mailto:lvirden@cas.org  </s>
