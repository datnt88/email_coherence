<s> Tim Berners-Lee: The idea of any "SHOULD" in the definition of equality for literals for any language give me the creeps.  </s>
<s> Which is to say 'should not' is inviting non-interop.  </s>
<s> Spot on.  </s>
<s> I reduced this constraint to 'should not' for a number of reasons, notably backward compatibility with text in the M&amp;S, which fudges how lang tags affect comparison, and of which 'should not' is a reasonable interpretation, and the fact that a lang tag is optional.  </s>
<s> But really it all boils down to this sentence in the M&amp;S: the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part of the literal.  </s>
<s> The problem with that sentence is the word 'part'.  </s>
<s> Without falling down a mereological rathole, using 'part' there without some kind of explanation of what that means isn't helpful.  </s>
<s> Especially when the lang tag is mandated to add no information to the consequent graph, and, the processor is expected to indicate how it deals with lang tags.  </s>
<s> None of this helps interoperability.  </s>
<s> If we want to harden this to must we have to admit that a literal cannot exist without a lang tag and that a literal+xml is some kind of natural type, or at least hold a notion that each 'part' of a literal affects decisions regarding its equality.  </s>
<s> I like to fight the good fight against that: a lang tag is clearly not necessary for all literals.  </s>
<s> A lang tag is not part of a literal anymore than an RDF statement about Tim Berners Lee is part of him.  </s>
<s> It's an interpretation of a literal that it's in English or French; interpretation implies semantics and that implies it belongs in the graph.  </s>
<s> That's to say, lang tags imply semantic equivalences over literals and not just the syntactic ones made by most string ops as you rightly point out.  </s>
<s> The layering is all out of kilter.  </s>
<s> The issue is symptomatic of a general problem, Each xml attribute used to qualify a literal is a hack to hang a property of a literal.  </s>
<s> Tim Berners-Lee: I am nervous about the effects of langauge tags, I must say.  </s>
<s> I'm more nervous about the way xml:lang has crept up from a syntactic artefact of XML-RDF, to be a candidate for an abstract description of a literal.  </s>
<s> And it makes abstract notions of RDF dependent on at least one other spec, that isn't in my mind central to web architecture.  </s>
<s> Tim Berners-Lee: Presumably the alternative choices would have been to deprecate the language tags on RDF literals, in favour of either using XML with parsetype literal, d:name rdf:parseType="literal" span xml:lang="fr" chat / / or RDF itself Or just allow statements about literals.  </s>

<s> I keep on seeing this.  </s>
<s> It isn't true.  </s>
<s> The lang tag might not cause any new nodes and arcs to be added, but it _does_ add information to the graph, because the literal node is labelled (language, content) and is distinct from the node labelled (content) ...even if the contents are lexically identical.  </s>

<s> Ooh yeah, looking good!  </s>
<s> Now stretch - and relax.  </s>
<s> Hi Jan, Ok, you got me.  </s>
<s> The MT doesn't preclude a label with two members.  </s>
<s> But if we can have both of those forms why not go on to have n-membered literals (the MT doesn't preclude that either)?  </s>
<s> I guess then being in a literal label means you're 'part' of the literal.  </s>
<s> That wouldn't rule this label out: (language) do we need to sat anything about this case at the MT level, or can we rely on syntactic restrictions along the lines of no content no literal?  </s>
