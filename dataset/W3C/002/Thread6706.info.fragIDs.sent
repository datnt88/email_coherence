Hi, 
I've put some specs (HTML &amp; CSS) online after reformatting them, here: Would you be interested of such formats? 
Is there something I could do for 
it? 
Maybe provide this web viewer and CHM converting capability? 
Or would you like to put link to this page somewhere? 
Thank you, Ilkka 
Hello, Ilkka, 
Thank you for writing. 
I couldn't see the documents but can tell you that W3C uses CSS and formatting that is developed with our Publication Rules [1]. 
I think that this Webmaster FAQ [2] will help to answer your questions. 
If not please let us know.

Hi Susan, And thanks for the answer. 
I took them offline for a moment, because I found out that I may need a permission from W3C to actually put them online. 
There waw some confusion in that process, first I thought they wuold be ok to distribute, but then someone instructed me to ask you for permission. 
The URL is now: http://www.visiomode.com/w3c/ 
That URL is not "public" - it's not linked from anywhere. 
So, if you have some comments on those specs now at that URL, I would be very interested. 
Can they be put online, would you be interested for distributing them? 
Thank you, Ilkka 
for
