<s> Hello All, I want to thank everyone for their insights to my numerous questions.  </s>
<s> Everyone has been most helpful.  </s>
<s> We have a question about the XML DSig spec regarding Section 4.3.3.2, Reference Processing Model.  </s>
<s> Specifically, we would like to clarify the following prose:  </s>
<s> /snip.. 1. URI="" Identifies the nodeset (minus any comment nodes) of the XML resource containing the signature 2. URI="#chapter1" Identifies a nodeset containing the element with ID attribute value 'chapter1' of the XML resource containing the signature.  </s>
<s> XML Signature (and its applications) modify this nodeset to include the element plus all descendents including namespaces and attributes -- but not comments.  </s>
<s> /snip.. Consider the following clarification, and please let us know if this is the  </s>
<s> correct interpretation: When a same-document reference (1) or a bare fragment identifier (2) is used  </s>
<s> as a URI Reference, it must be dereferenced as an XPath node-set.  </s>
<s> This node-set must have ALL comments stripped from it (e.g. equivalent to passing the node-set through an arbitrary 'comment stripping' transformation) before canonicalization is used.  </s>
<s> The type of canonicalization used is orthogonal to the stripping of all comments.  </s>
<s> For example, comments must still be stripped even if a canonicalization  </s>
<s> method that preserves comments is used.  </s>
<s> And finally, why must comments be stripped anyway?  </s>

<s> To retain comments while selecting an element by an identifier ID, use the following full XPointer: URI='#xpointer(id('ID'))'. To retain comments while selecting the entire document, use the following full XPointer: URI='#xpointer(/)'.  </s>
<s> This XPointer contains a simple XPath expression that includes the root node, which the second to last step above replaces with all nodes of the parse tree (all descendants, plus all attributes, plus all namespaces nodes).  </s>

<s> Hi Joseph and Blake,  </s>
<s> If C14N is called with a node-set, then it processes the node-set.  </s>
<s> Only if it is called with an octet stream does it behave as if running an XPath that eliminates comments.  </s>
<s> Therefore to retain the default behavior of stripping comments, we defined the processing model for References as stripping the comments out.  </s>
<s> As to why comment stripping is the default and required c14n, the WG decided that comment stripping represented the lowest common denominator XML processor, which is not strictly required to provide comments to the calling application.  </s>
