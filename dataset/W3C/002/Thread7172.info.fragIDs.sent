Is there a way to specify a fragment identifer relative to the document in the current base URI. 
I can't see a way to do this. 
If I use ./#frag, then the final path component of the base URI is omitted. 
So I see no way of indicating a fragment of the base URI without including some part of the base URI.

Er, "#frag", right? 
What am I missing?

According to the URI spec [1], that is relative to the *current document*, as opposed to the current base URI. 
For example, when xml:base is used within an XML document, the #frag is not (as I understand) relative to the base URI. 
The URI spec [1] is quite explicit about stating that when resolving #frag relative to some base URI, it refers to a fragment the *current document* as distinct from the base URI; cf. algorithm in section 5.2. 
#g [1] http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html (I'm using this latest work-in-progress as a reference, but, without explicitly checking, I think the current spec says the same.)

omitted. 
By 2396 that's a "same document reference"... there was some discussion of this way back on the URI list [1].

Yes, but note that the following issue fragment is a request to change that algorithm. 
The only way that can be accomplished is by changing the spec to remove the bit about current document and instead replace the empty URI with the base URI, later stating that a retrieval action must not take place if the new URI differs from the base URI only by its fragment.
