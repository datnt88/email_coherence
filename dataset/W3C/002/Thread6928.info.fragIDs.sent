<s> Hi Patrick, I would suggest that perhaps uri@w3.org  </s>
<s> would be an even more appropriate forum for this debate?  </s>
<s> Whatever the case, I'll send this to www-talk, BCC'ing uri, and you can decide where to follow-up to.  </s>
<s> To define e.g. an 'http:' URL which is never intended to resolve to anything is IMO contrary to the defined semantics for such URLs and thus bad practice.  </s>
<s> No; you are implying that there is a default base of semantics for HTTP identifiers, that they are intended to resolve to a set of documents, or somesuch.  </s>
<s> HTTP makes no such assumption; if you look  </s>
<s> through the range of HTTP respose codes, you'll find that there are a multitude of things that HTTP can say already: here's some information, it's moved to here, I couldn't find it, you need to be authenticated, or whatever.  </s>
<s> HTTP is very extensible, so one could quite easily conceive of a "here's some information about what you are looking for" response code in a future version of HTTP.  </s>
<s> TimBL mentioned this idea on RDF IG (but I don't have a reference, and I'm going to be lazy).  </s>
<s> The point is that there is no "intention" about what an HTTP URI, or any other of the so-called "URLs" identify - that is up to the person who owns the information space under some domain name or IP address.  </s>
<s> Gee, how about if I start minting bogus 'mailto:' URLs [...]  </s>
<s> "mailto:" URIs are not HTTP URIs, and it's not helping your case to back up your assertion by noting the properties of an unrelated URI scheme.  </s>
<s> The semantics of "mailto:" are clearly defined as representing "a mailbox", I agree.  </s>
<s> HTTP URIs don't necessarily identify anything in particular; they are much looser.  </s>
<s> I could just as validly say that 'http:' URIs are meant to resolve, [...]  </s>
<s> HTTP URIs denote a resource.  </s>
<s> The nature of the discussion that we're having is whther or not they necessarily identify some subset of resources, and where this is defined.  </s>
<s> Until you show me that definition in a standards track document, or through a resoned dissertation on common practices, then I will not be given over to the idea that HTTP URIs can only identify certain resources.  </s>
<s> This is a wholly arbitrary restriction you are placing upon HTTP, and I see no grounds or basis for this at all.  </s>
<s> Common behavior is to expect that 'http:' URIs resolve to web resources of some sort.  </s>
<s> What you meant to say is that common behaviour is to stick an HTTP URI into a browser of some sort, and hit "go".  </s>
<s> That is not the same as expecting an HTTP URI to resolve to a Web resource.  </s>
<s> You expect it to resolve to a Web resource when you stick it in a browser, but beyond that, you don't know what behaviour a User Agent is going to have.  </s>
<s> But that's besides the point... the question of this debate is what *sort* of resource HTTP URIs are supposed to resolve to, and you seem to be avoiding addressing that question directly.  </s>
<s> What do you expect an HTTP URI to resolve to?  </s>
<s> Some data?  </s>
<s> I can argue, as I have done many times in the past, that the *practicality* of the use of HTTP URIs is that the binding of the identifier to the resource is acutually variable depending upon the context.  </s>
<s> This is an idea that I usually pitch when talking about persistence, and goes something like this:- There are various levels of use for HTTP URIs, ranging from the very large scale through to the small scale:- * This HTTP URI identifies some path on some server; "widgets" on "example.org"  </s>
<s> * This HTTP URI identifies the concept of widgets, example use: "it is commonly known that _widgets_ [link] are becoming increasingly rare..." * This HTTP URI identifies *a* page about widgets, example: "see _Fred's page on widgets_ [link]" * This HTTP URI identifies *the* page about widgets, example: "Fred: 'I like Widgets', Cite: _widgets_ [link]" You can see that the level of persistence decreases as you go down the list.  </s>
<s> As far as we are concerned for this conversation, we can note that the expectation of what the URI denotes changes as we go down the list, increasing in specificity at each step.  </s>
<s> You can tell that all of these steps (and probably some further steps in between) are valid uses of HTTP URIs, and I think that it is wrong of you to assert that HTTP is tied to any one of these.  </s>
<s> It isn't used that way, and no one has ever said that you must use it that way.  </s>
<s> All RDF does is go up the list instead of down it, and although that disquiets people, it's a perfectly valid use of HTTP URIs.  </s>
<s> [...] the current "There's no such thing as URL or URN, only URI" nonsense seems just spin to make the mess seem less than it is.  </s>
<s> IMO the IETF/W3C should be a bit embarrased.  </s>
<s> They blew it.  </s>
<s> Of course - but I don't think that anyone is trying to hide that.  </s>
<s> On the contrary, I believe that the W3C at least is trying very hard to clear up the mess; but the field is a mix of opinions (about 5 per URI expert), and so it's going to take time to resolve.  </s>
<s> I can't even discern a clear consensus on the most basic of issues from any of the "experts".  </s>
<s> And I'm not just complaining.  </s>
<s> I'm also working to try to help clean up the mess, for the sake future web generations.  </s>
<s> Join the club :-)  </s>
<s> And to be honest, the lack of a *formal* taxonomy of URI schemes is a pity.  </s>
<s> I think that one is sorely needed.  </s>
<s> The problem with trying to initiate and install a URI taxonomy within the Web environment at this late stage is that no one is going to listen, or no one is going to care, or most likely: both.  </s>
<s> People don't really want to understand what's going on with URIs and so on when they're just using them in day-to-day applications, and that's fine... but the software developers and so on need to be very wary, and it is evident that there hasn't really been a market for making sure that URIs are well defined until things like RDF came around.  </s>
<s> And of course, it's clear that we do in fact need some decent corpus devoted to URI usage - we've been arguing amongst ourselves for a long time now, and often go around in circles.  </s>
<s> Like "tag:" and "urn:pts:"?  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> Yes. Exactly.  </s>
<s> And others like 'em.  </s>
<s> Well, we only really need one.  </s>
<s> Really, I would like "tag:" to be registered, but it doesn't seem as if that's going to happen any time this year, and perhaps not even next year, so my impatience will probably dictate that I register an informal URN NID.  </s>
<s> Heck, it only takes about 3 weeks to push one through, and I'm sure that there would be very little in the way of resistance, due to the determination of so many people to have such a scheme.  </s>
<s> Hey, I can make URLs work, sure, and I can also cook hot dogs on the engine of my car... but should we park a car in the kitchen of a restaurant to cook on?  </s>
<s> Nope.  </s>
<s> Er...  </s>
<s> Your results will hopefully be useful, but I'm really not convinced about the validity of your motive.  </s>
<s> My motives are pure.  </s>
<s> Really.  </s>
<s> I'll send you a photo of me in my white hat ;-)  </s>
<s> Heh, heh! :-) What I meant is that we both have different reasons for wanting to have a set of easily creatable URIs for generic concepts that are not HTTP-URIs.  </s>
<s> You want then because for some reason you think that HTTP-URIs-to-identify-concepts suck.  </s>
<s> I want them because I don't believe that we should be necessarily tied to using HTTP URIs to identify concepts, that we should have to pay for domains to have decent persistent identifers, and that we shouldn't have to fear having our domains whipped out from underneath us because we didn't pay the bill, or the registrar screwed up, or whatever.  </s>
<s> Ask DanC: it happens, and it's not pretty when it does.  </s>
<s> Of course, there's also the point that Roy Fielding raised, which is that URIs are only persistent when you have a big enough user base for them.  </s>
<s> HTTP URIs are good because the entire world uses them, and it's something that's going to be difficult to address for "tag:" or whatever.  </s>
<s> We need to get these URIs going so that we can start evangelizing them right away; implementing them, and spreading the word.  </s>
<s> And in case I didn't add enough of these above...  </s>
<s> Same goes, BTW; as usual, it has been a pleasure to rant at you, Patrick :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .  </s>
<s> :Sean :hasHomepage http://purl.org/net/sbp/ .  </s>
<s> To define e.g. an 'http:' URL which is never intended to resolve to anything is IMO contrary to the defined semantics for such URLs and thus bad practice.  </s>
<s> If the http URI is defined by RFC 2616 (as indicated by section 2.1.1 of seems pretty clear --- cut --- 3.2.2 http URL The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and semantics for http URLs.  </s>
<s> http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]] If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed.  </s>
<s> The semantics are that the identified resource is located at the server listening for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI for the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2). --- cut --- I.e. there are some defined semantics that http URIs resolve to something located on a server?  </s>
<s> Is the RFC wrong, or am I mis-interpretting it?  </s>
<s> Having said that, I accept that current http URI usage goes well beyond this, i.e. people are assigning http URIs to all sort of things, and that we've probably got past the stage where it is worth having the argument.  </s>
<s> A question... If I make an RDF statement about a conceptual namespace, or about the RDFS resource that is at that URI?  </s>
<s> In either case, how do I make a statement about the other one?  </s>
