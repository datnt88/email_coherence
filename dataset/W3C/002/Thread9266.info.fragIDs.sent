<s> Finally, at last, there is a new version of the MT document at  </s>
<s> Ive used DanC's 'set of triples' way of describing RDF graphs (with all the horrid math in the appendix), I think Ive fixed all the known bugs in the tables, and have put in guarded comments about datatypes not being done yet (see esp. end of 1.2 ).  </s>
<s> It is still missing the long-promised proofs of the lemmas, but I will graft those on rather than keep it hanging around any longer.  </s>
<s> Sorry this has taken so long.  </s>
<s> I will be unable to take part in telecons until mid-January, and wont be reading much email either.  </s>
<s> Happy holidays, and all.  </s>

<s> Good stuff...  </s>
<s> I did a quick review; I hope the artifacts of using the #rdfig channel and the scratchpad won't get in the way... RDF Model Theory (draft) 2001-12-12, Pat Hayes posted by dajobe at 2001-12-12 19:52 dajobe: as usual, I've checked it into CVS so you can see the differences dajobe: to previous drafts which were published at the same URL DanC: issues: (a) datatypes.  </s>
<s> explicitly called out by the editor, but could be linked to issues list  </s>
<s> DanC: I'd like to see more motivation for the use of blank nodes.  </s>
<s> it just says "seems more in keeping with [RDFMS]" which doesn't do our extensive discussions justice.  </s>
<s> DanC: I've been asked for more justification of this point in SWAD meetings.  </s>
<s> DanC: issue: "since such value spaces as integers cannot be fully axiomatized in first-order logic.  </s>
<s> DanC: " seems to appear out of nowhere.  </s>
<s> Delete it or explain it better.  </s>
<s> DanC: issue: "Herbrand Lemma.  </s>
<s> Any RDF graph has a satisfying interpretation.  </s>
<s> DanC: " this needs discussion, as we discovered in a telcon a couple weeks ago.  </s>
<s> DanC: I think you can say false things in RDF.  </s>
<s> e.g. using ont:disjointFrom  </s>
<s> DanC: "tidying the resulting set" under 2.2 - editorial left-over.  </s>
<s> DanC: "namespace entailment" - don't like this term.  </s>
<s> layered entailment, vocabulary entailment, maybe.  </s>
<s> hmm...  </s>
<s> DanC: RDFS reserved vocabulary - actually, there is a semantic constraint for some of those other terms: isDefinedBy rdfs:subPropertyOf seeAlso  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> OK, that version is now dated 14 December and has the following changes, in response to Dan's comments below.  </s>
<s> I suggest that this version be archived and announced to WebOnt, as per today's telecon discussion.  </s>
<s> Or, if you like, I can tell them to get it from the above URI, which should be stable enough to use.  </s>
<s> I scanned the issue list but didn't see one that would characterize it!  </s>
<s> (I get the impression that this has gotten bigger than any one of our named issues.)  </s>
<s> OK, point taken.  </s>
<s> I put in a few sentences and a pointer to the issues list where one can track on into the discussions in the archives.  </s>
<s> If you would prefer something different, or want to see other issues addressed, say what or suggest a change.  </s>
<s> (Might be helpful if you could expand on what it is that is worrying people.  </s>
<s> I am at a bit of a loss here, in that this seems such an obvious point that I have trouble following what kind of justification people could possibly be asking for; its a bit like finding people worried about the need to have feet on the ends of ones legs.)  </s>
<s> OK, deleted  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> The proof of the lemma is simple, and surely ont: disjointFrom just isn't part of the RDF vocabulary, right?  </s>
<s> I think the point is that the semantic restrictions associated with the ont: vocabulary go beyond simple entailment.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> OK, replaced with 'vocabulary entailment'  </s>
<s> Oh damn.  </s>
<s> Rats.  </s>
<s> Then I will have to include all that vocabulary in all those tables, just to say this piffling constraint.  </s>
<s> Grumble grumble.  </s>
<s> I reserve the right to put this off to the next draft.  </s>
