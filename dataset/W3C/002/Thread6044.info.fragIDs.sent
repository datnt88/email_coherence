<s> Hi Folks, Please excuse the cross post, but I'm looking for two kinds of questions that you want answered when you are evaluating a new specification to decide if you think it is worth exploring further to determine if you think it is ready for adoption.  </s>
<s> First, what is most immediately important, or else you wont look further.  </s>
<s> Second, what do you look for in ease of implementation.  </s>
<s> I am asking because I'm helping with a FAQ for a spec that is moving toward approval, and we need to build a FAQ to help evaluators make these kinds of decisions.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Rex Rex Brooks GeoAddress: 1361-A Addison, Berkeley, CA, 94702 USA, Earth W3Address: http://www.starbourne.com  </s>
<s> I can't say that this is #1, but I always look at who's behind the specification in terms of both authors (vendors/federal agencies/consulting firms, etc.) and consortium (if there is a consortium).  </s>
<s> Kind Regards, Joe Chiusano Booz | Allen | Hamilton Strategy and Technology Consultants to the World  </s>
<s> Rex, That's easy #1 - the vision and the motivation (why is this happening?) #2 - the appropriateness and the need (value / fit to existing work) #3 - technical approach / innovation / chair / feasibility #4 - applicability to work I am contributing to / part of / using #5 - social benefit(s) / delivery schedule / sponsors Thanks, DW.  </s>
