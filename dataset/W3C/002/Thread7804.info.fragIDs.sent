<s> And if you want to protect a URI mapping... you'd have to lock the collection chain up to the root.  </s>
<s> Even more overkill.  </s>
<s> gmc/ But the URL is "protected" by a LOCK, since we are requiring that a subsequent use of the URL with that lock token always select that locked resource.  </s>
<s> We're just removing the language in 2518 that over-constrained the server implementation (i.e. removing the language that said you cannot apply a MOVE or a DELETE to a locked resource).  </s>
<s> What 2518 didn't realize (and neither did I until Edgar pointed it out) you don't need to prevent the MOVE or DELETE just to keep a handle on the locked resource.  </s>
<s> So you only need to apply a lock to a collection if you really want to reserve the right to change the membership or properties of that collection.  </s>
