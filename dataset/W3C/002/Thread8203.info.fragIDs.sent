<s> I'm not sure... this is a registry for namespace names, DTD identifiers, XML schemas or RDF schemas -- not for specific element names.  </s>
<s> How do you think it can be applied to WebDAV properties?  </s>
<s> Well, one possibility is that a set of custom WebDAV properties (or at the limit, just one) could be expressed in an XML schema, and that schema could be registered.  </s>
<s> Another possibility is that committed individuals could work with Mealling to see if it's feasible for the registry specification to include specific element names.  </s>
