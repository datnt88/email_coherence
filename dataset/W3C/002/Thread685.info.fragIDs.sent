What exactly is it that prevents me from tidying this page? 
Thanks again for Tidy -- I'm going to have to scrounge up a postcard... Aaron Swartz me@aaronsw.com | ...schoolyard subversion... http://www.aaronsw.com

I don't know, but I hope you realize that Tidy is doing a valiant job of attempting to parse it, and totting up well over four hundred errors in the process -- to see this list of errors, just add "-f errors.txt" 
(no quotation marks) to the command line. 
I'd start by converting all the unescaped "&amp;" to "&amp;amp;" and removing 
blogdateheader " and " /blogdateheader ". 
Then try Tidy again.

How about: line 206 column 115 - Error: blogdateheader is not recognized! 
This error occurs several times in the file. 
If you really want to leave this unknown element in the tidied file, you will need to declare it. 
See the Tidy page for details of how to declare new tags.

Thanks a lot, Dave! 
Sorry for the terse message, but I was juggling five things at the time. 
I didn't realize Tidy completely choked on unknown tags...perhaps it should just strip them?
