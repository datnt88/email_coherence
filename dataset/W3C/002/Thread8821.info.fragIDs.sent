Date: Subject: New XML Signature implementation and Update for Inter-Op Hi Joseph, 
Phaos Technology's XML Toolkit, which includes XML-DSIG and XML Encryption implementations, has just been released. 
Below are the results of our tests vs. Merlin's interop examples. 
I would appreciate it if you could update the XML-DSIG interop matrix and toolkit links (http://www.phaos.com/e_security/prod_xml.html) accordingly.

Could you supply some test vectors generated by your implementation to the mailing list? 
Christian 
Yes, just as soon as I get some cleaned up for public consumption.
