<s> Here is my initial draft of requirements that should be present in HTTP to support distributed authoring.  </s>
<s> The intent is to only discuss distributed authoring requirements in this document, and to not discuss versioning requirements, as much as this is possible (locking, edit notification, and relationships are overlapping issues, though.) I've posted this to both the versioning and distributed authoring lists, but my intent is to have discussion take place on the distributed authoring list ( w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org to join).  </s>
<s> I'm hoping to be able to package this up in IETF standard format and send it off for comment by the HTTP WG later next week.  </s>
<s> Many thanks to Yaron Goland, David Durand, Fabio Vitali, Christopher Seiwald, and Judith Slein for their ifnromative posts which really helped clarify and provide rationale for these requirements.  </s>
<s> - Jim Requirements on HTTP for Distributed Editing Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine, ejw@ics.uci.edu  </s>
<s> Rev. 0.1, August 29, 1996 Abstract TBD. 1.0 INTRODUCTION This document describes functionality which, if provided in the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Specification [Ref HTTP/1.1 Spec.], would support the interoperability of tools which allow remote loading, editing and saving (publishing) of various media types using HTTP.  </s>
<s> As much as possible, this functionality is described without suggesting a proposed implementation, since in general, there are many ways to perform the functionality within the HTTP framework.  </s>
<s> Much of the functionality described in this document stems from the assumption that people performing distributed authoring only have access to the objects they are editing via the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> This is in contrast to the majority of current authoring practice, where there is access to the underlying storage media, often via a shell or graphical user interface to a filesystem.  </s>
<s> Authors need more than just remote control over their individual documents: they need remote control over the namespace in which those documents reside.  </s>
<s> Currently, authors control their namespace by interacting directly with the underlying storage system, but when performing distributed authoring this access is not available.  </s>
<s> 2.0 REQUIREMENTS In the requirement descriptions below, the requirement will be stated, followed by its rationale.  </s>
<s> If any current distributed authoring tools currently implement the requirement, this is also mentioned.  </s>
<s> It is assumed that "server" means "a program which receives and responds to HTTP requests," and that "distributed authoring tool" or "intranet enabled tool" means "a program which can retrieve a source entity via HTTP, allow editing of this entity, and then save/publish this entity to a server using HTTP."  </s>
<s> A "client" is "a program which issues HTTP requests and accepts responses."  </s>
<s> 1. Source Retrieval.  </s>
<s> The source of any given entity should be retrievable via HTTP.  </s>
<s> There are many cases where the source entity stored on a server does not correspond to the actual entity transmitted in response to an HTTP GET.  </s>
<s> Current known cases are server side include directives, and SGML which is converted on the fly to HTML.  </s>
<s> There are many possible cases, such as automatic conversion of bitmap images into several variant bitmap media types (e.g. GIF, JPEG), and automatic conversion of an application's native media type into HTML.  </s>
<s> As an example of this last case, a word processor could store its native media type on a server which automatically converts it to HTML.  </s>
<s> A GET of this entity would retrieve the HTML.  </s>
<s> Retrieving the source of this entity would retrieve the word processor native entity.  </s>
<s> 2. Locks.  </s>
<s> It should be possible, via HTTP, to restrict modification of an entity to a specific person, or list of persons.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to query for whether a given URL has any active modification restrictions, and if so, who currently has modification permission.  </s>
<s> 3. Independence of locks.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to lock an entity without re-reading the entity, and without commiting to editing an entity.  </s>
<s> At present, HTTP does not provide any support for preventing two or more people from overwriting each other's modifications when they save to a given URL.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, there is no way for people to discover if someone else is currently making modifications to an entity.  </s>
<s> This is known as the "lost update problem," or the "overwrite problem."  </s>
<s> Since there can be significant cost associated with discovering and repairing lost modifications, preventing this problem is crucial for supporting distributed authoring.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, locking support is also a key component of many versioning schemes, a desirable capability for distributed authoring.  </s>
<s> An author may wish to lock an entire web of entities even though they are editing just a single entity, just to keep the other entities from changing.  </s>
<s> In this way, an author can ensure that if a local hypertext web is consistent in their distributed authoring tool, it will then be consistent when they write it to the server.  </s>
<s> Because of this, it should be possible to take out a lock without also causing transmission of the contents of an entity.  </s>
<s> Similarly, it should not be assumed that because an entity is locked, that it will necessarily be modified.  </s>
<s> 4. Notification of Intention to Edit.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to notify the HTTP server that an entity is about to be edited by a given person.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to query the HTTP server for the list of people who have notified the server of their intent to edit an entity.  </s>
<s> Experience from configuration management systems has shown that people need to know when they are about to enter a parallel editing situation.  </s>
<s> Once notified, they either decide not to edit in parallel with the other authors, or they use out-of-band communication (face-to-face, telephone, etc.) to coordinate their editing to minimize the difficulty of merging their results.  </s>
<s> Notification is separate from locking, since a lock does not necesssarily imply an entity will be edited, and a notification of intention to edit does not carry with it any access restrictions.  </s>
<s> This capability is supportive of versioning, since a check-out is typically involves taking out a lock, making a notification of intention to edit, and getting the entity to be edited.  </s>
<s> 5. Relationships.  </s>
<s> Via HTTP, it should be possible to create, query, and delete arbitrary typed relationships (links) between entities of any media type.  </s>
<s> Relationships (or links which are not necessarily navigable) between entities can be used for many purposes.  </s>
<s> Relationships support pushbutton printing of a multi-resource document in a prescribed order, jumping to the access control page for an entity, and quick browsing of related information, such as a table of contents, an index, a glossary, help pages, etc. While relationship support is provided by the HTML "LINK" element, this is limited only to HTML entities, and does not support bitmap image types, and other non-HTML media types.  </s>
<s> AOLpress, America Online, currently "allows pages to add toolbar buttons on the fly using the HTML 3.2 LINK REL.... tag.  </s>
<s> For example, your page can add toolbar buttons that link to a home page, table of contents, index, glossary, copyright page, next page, previous page, help page, higher level page, or a bookmark in the document."  </s>
<s> (Source: 6. Attributes.  </s>
<s> Via HTTP, it should be possible to create, query, and delete arbitrary attributes on entities of any media type.  </s>
<s> Attributes can be used to define fields (such as author, title, subject, organization) on resources of any media type, which can be used later in searches.  </s>
<s> Attributes also support the creation of catalog entries as a placeholder for an entity which are not available in electronic form, or which will be available later.  </s>
<s> 7. List URL Hierarchy Level.  </s>
<s> A listing of all entities, along with their media type, and last modified date, which are located at a specific URL [ref RFC 1738] hierarchy level in an http URL scheme should be accessible via HTTP.  </s>
<s> In [ref RFC 1738] it states that, "some URL schemes (such as the ftp, http, and file schemes) contain names that can be considered hierarchical."  </s>
<s> Especially for HTTP servers which directly map all or part of their URL name space into a filesystem, it is very useful to get a listing of all resources located at a particular hierarchy level.  </s>
<s> This functionality supports "Save As..." dialog boxes, which provide a listing of the entities at a current hierarchy level, and allow navigation through the hierarchy.  </s>
<s> It also supports the creation of graphical visualizations (typically as a network) of the hypertext structure among the entities at a hierarchy level, or set of levels.  </s>
<s> It also supports a tree visualization of the entities and their hierarchy levels.  </s>
<s> AOLpress, America Online, currently supports "Save As..." dialog boxes, and graphical network visualization of a portion of a site's hypertext structure, which they term a "mini-web."  </s>
<s> FrontPage, Microsoft, also currently supports a graphical network visualization and additionally support a tree visualization of a portion of a site's structure.  </s>
<s> 8. Make URL Hierarchy Level.  </s>
<s> Via HTTP, it should be possible to create a new URL hierarchy level in an http URL scheme.  </s>
<s> The ability to create containers to hold related entities supports management of a name space by packaging its members into small, related clusters.  </s>
<s> This utility of this capability is demonstrated by its wide implementation in recent operating systems.  </s>
<s> The ability to create a URL hierarchy level also supports the creation of "Save As..." dialog boxes with "New Level/Folder/Directory" capability, common in many applications.  </s>
<s> AOLpress, America Online, currently supports this capability through their "Save As..." dialog box, and their custom MKDIR method.  </s>
<s> 9. Copy.  </s>
<s> Via HTTP, it should be possible to make a byte-for-byte duplicate of an entity without a client loading, then resaving the entity.  </s>
<s> This copy should leave an audit trail.  </s>
<s> There are many reasons why an entity might need to be duplicated, such as change of ownership, a precursor to major modifications, or to make a backup.  </s>
<s> In combination with delete functionality, copy can be used to implement rename and move capabilities, by performing a copy to a new name, and a delete of the old name.  </s>
<s> Due to network costs associated with loading and saving an entity, it is far preferable to have a server perform an entity copy than a client.  </s>
<s> If a copied entity records which entity it is a copy of, then it would be possible for a cache to avoid loading the copied entity if it already locally stores the original.  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Rename.  </s>
<s> Via HTTP, it should be possible to change the URL of an entity without a client loading, then resaving the entity under a different name.  </s>
<s> It is often necessary to change the name of an entity, for example due to adoption of a new naming convention, or if a typing error was made entering the name originally.  </s>
<s> Due to network costs, it is undesirable to perform this operation by loading, then resaving the entity, followed by a delete of the old entity.  </s>
<s> Ideally an HTTP server should record the rename operation, and issue a "301 Moved Permanently" status code for requests on the old URL.  </s>
<s> Note that moving an entity is considered the same function as renaming an entity.  </s>
<s> Overall I am a very happy camper.  </s>
<s> I think the document does an excellent job of addressing the main issues while leaving minor ones to be squabbled over later.  </s>
<s> However I am definitely itching to get into the blood and guts of how we intend to implement this stuff.  </s>
<s> I noticed that partial writes were not addressed.  </s>
<s> If I am editing a 10 megabyte file and want to change a single word I am forced to upload the entire file.  </s>
<s> With partial writes I can just change the areas I am interested in.  </s>
<s> We also need to address an issue I neglected to address in my original document - Insertion Writes.  </s>
<s> I have added the following sentence to section 1, Partial [Read | Write] in my needs document: "In addition a mechanism is needed to do insert writes such that one can specify that a section of bytes should be inserted into the file at a specified position."  </s>
<s> Section 1. Source retrieval The connection between 'presentation' and 'source' isn't straight forward.  </s>
<s> For example, what is the source of a program?  </s>
<s> The obvious answer would be the source code but what about the object files?  </s>
<s> There should be mention of these complex relationships and the possibility that the path from presentation to source may be linear with many nodes or may have many branches.  </s>
<s> I admit my bias here in thinking that the whole issue of "Get for Edit" should be absorbed into Section 5 - Relationships.  </s>
<s> Sections 2 &amp; 3 - Locks and Independence of Locks I realize I am perilously close to nit picking but I am uncomfortable with the use of the word Lock in this context.  </s>
<s> Especially in light of point 4. I realize that Check Out is a loaded term because different systems implement it in different ways but Lock is an equally loaded term.  </s>
<s> A more substantial issue is partial write locks.  </s>
<s> Industrial strength distributed authoring involves large files with complex structures.  </s>
<s> Partial write locks are necessary if we are going to have several different authors munging through the same file.  </s>
<s> This issue becomes even more relevant when databases are shared.  </s>
<s> Section 7. This is just an editing point but I think the wording of the last paragraph in this section should read "FrontPage from Microsoft also..." Yaron  </s>
<s> Nice work!  </s>
<s> I've just been looking through the Document Management Alliance's requirements papers for possible additions.  </s>
<s> I notice a few things: Need to be able to retrieve attributes for viewing or editing.  </s>
<s> Containers (which I guess translate to URL hierarchy levels in the terminology you use) can have attributes -- probably different ones from the ones that attach to documents -- that need to be set and retrieved.  </s>
<s> Need to be able to deal with compound (multi-file) documents that are not HTML documents.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what all the implications of this may be, but at least the document attributes get associated with the document as a whole, not with any one of its files.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to reference a single document from multiple containers.  </s>

<s> MailStop:128-29E  </s>
<s> Right now, the read-only web doesn't support the notion of containers; there are just some documents that contain more pointers to other documents.  </s>
<s> I think the behavior of web/FTP proxy servers is a good model for how the web currently treats directories.  </s>
<s> To actually support containers, we might want to support the notion of a new kind of object (not text/html) that is the actual 'container', and then some operations for servers to generate unique names within their name space.  </s>
<s> I don't think it is right to translate containers to URL hierarchy levels.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> I think Larry's point is a good one.  </s>
<s> Containers should be supported as mime types which are then pointed to by URLs.  </s>
