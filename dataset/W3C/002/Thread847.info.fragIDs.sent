Hi, Can someone tell me whether java api exists for HTML Tidy? 
Thank You.

There is a Java version of Tidy (JTidy), but I don't know whether it has been kept in sync with the new C based HTML Tidy library.

Looks to me like it might have slipped behind the C version. 
ISTR the developers originally wanted to track the C library, but they haven't released stuff recently.
