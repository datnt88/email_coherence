<s> Graham, this must be a misunderstanding We have already 10 RDFS-entailment and RDFS closures rules in and at least 3 draft ones for the RDFD-MT that fix here is just maybe 2 extra proposed ones for the RDFD-MT  </s>

<s> Jos, I think you're right that it's a misunderstabnding...  </s>
<s> I was responding to "We build a rule mechanism", which I understood to be a means to define rules *in RDF* (similar to log:implies in N3), and which I think would be a unacceptably substantial change to RDF at this stage.  </s>
<s> If this means simply that we define some extra closure rules, then I withdraw that particular objection.  </s>
<s> Thinking aloud... would a new closure rule work?  </s>

<s> age rdfd:datatype xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> to: jenny age _:x .  </s>
<s> _:x xsd:integer "10" .  </s>

<s> ) log:implies { ?s  </s>
<s> ?p _:newx .  </s>
<s> _:newx ?d  </s>
<s> ?l .  </s>
<s> } which isn't quite what the datatyping proposal currently says, because the rule fires whenever the object of ?p is something denoted by a literal, not simply when an actual literal is used.  </s>
<s> Is this the sort of thing you had in mind?  </s>

<s> ... cwm likes it, so I suppose it's OK; doesn't generate any triples, so I suppose it's a device for labelling?  </s>
<s> Hey, even my own N3 parser thinks it's OK.  </s>
<s> I guess the [ :f ( ?p ?d  </s>
<s> ?q  </s>
<s> ?s  </s>
<s> ?o ) ] is some kind of analog of a Skolem function?  </s>
<s> I guess you might need that for proof finding, but for deductive closure ... aha, I see -- I called mine "_:newx"!  </s>
<s> And rdfd:valueProp relates the property-with-literal-range to a corresponding property-with-value-range?  </s>
<s> Taking all that on board, I guess we're talking about pretty much the same idea here.  </s>
