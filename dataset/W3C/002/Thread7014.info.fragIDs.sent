<s> Greetings, everyone.  </s>
<s> I joined this list a couple of days ago, but have not seen any activity.  </s>
<s> I also searched the w3c site for any (public) archives, but could not  </s>

<s> Hi Chris, There are archives (7+ years) at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/  </s>
<s> I'd imagine so, unless there's an IRI list somewhere.  </s>

<s> Hello Chris, Thanks for mentioning the IRI draft.  </s>
<s> A new version has now officially been published, see below.  </s>
<s> Please also have a look at draft-ietf-idn-uri-02.txt, which is related.  </s>
<s> While the main discussion list for both drafts is different from this list, please feel free to raise any issues here that have to do with URIs in general.  </s>

<s> A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that  </s>
<s> IRIs can be used instead of URIs where appropriate to identify resources.  </s>
<s> The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen, instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs, to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software.  </s>
