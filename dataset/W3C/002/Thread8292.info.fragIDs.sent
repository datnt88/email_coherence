<s> Hi. It took long, but now we're done -- the WebDAV ACL protocol has been published as Proposed Standard.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> now that the ACL spec is published, we *should* create a new place for collecting spec issues (and hopefully their resolutions).  </s>
<s> For instance, this would include the last-minute change that in we end we did not do: For me the simplest way to do this is to create a document "draft-reschke-rfc3744bis" (starting with a copy of RFC3744), and add issue markers to the spec itself.  </s>
<s> I can then automatically create an issue list document.  </s>
<s> If there aren't any objections to that approach, I'll implement that sometime next week.  </s>
<s> Best regards,  </s>

<s> Sounds good to me.  </s>

<s> OK, the issues list is online at (you may want to link from webdav.org/acl to it, Geoff).  </s>
<s> Best regards, Julian  </s>
