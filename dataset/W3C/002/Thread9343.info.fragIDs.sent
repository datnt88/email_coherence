<s> I have fixed a few bugs, added more tests and bad test cases for non RDF documents.  </s>
<s> These are testing the three parts of this issue: 1. Tests 01-08 and bad tests 01-08 The following RDF attributes are required to have an rdf: prefix: about aboutEach aboutEachPrefix ID bagID type resource parseType 2. Test 09 and bad test 09 Namespace qualification MUST be used for all property attributes.  </s>
<s> 3. Tests 10-14 Non-prefixed RDF elements (NOT attributes) are allowed when a default XML element namespace is defined with an xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" attribute.  </s>
<s> All the tests have an input RDF/XML file test n .rdf with the required output triples in RDF/n3 test n .n3 and the bad tests are in test n -bad.rdf  </s>
<s> They have all been tested with SiRPAC and cwm/n3 as far as is possible (cwm doesn't seem to like aboutEach*).  </s>
<s> I am attaching them cloaked to this message but they should move somewhere well known on w3.org where we can tweak them, add explanatory html, pointers to code etc. when we get those.  </s>

<s> Very nice work.  </s>
<s> A quibble, just to show I read it carefully: This isn't an anonymous node; it's just a relative identifier: @prefix : # .  </s>
<s> :genid http:... ... .  </s>
<s> I'm proposing that we use _:genid http:... ... .  </s>
<s> i.e. no @prefix, just _:name.  </s>
<s> TimBL hacked support for it yesterday; let's see if it works... yup... $ python2 cwm.py --quiet --rdf --n3=spart --bySubject "bar" .  </s>
<s> hm... test2 doesn't work as well; cwm.py doesn't believe in bagID.  </s>
<s> in test4.n3,  </s>
<s> you've got a relative reference in your expected results, resulting from rdf:ID="foo".  </s>
<s> We're going to have to specify the base URI as part of test inputs so that we can absolutize everything consistently.  </s>
<s> Aha... test5 allows me to show what I'm after: $ python2 cwm.py --quiet --rdf --n3=spart --bySubject _:0 .  </s>
<s> _:0 http://example.org/property2  </s>
<s> "bar" .  </s>

<s> re test6: whoa!  </s>
<s> I didn't realize rdf:type as an attribute was special syntax; i.e. that it takes a URIref rather than a literal.  </s>
<s> None of the code I've written groks that.  </s>
