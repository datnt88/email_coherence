In addition to Geoff's answer: If you are an administrator trying to unlock a resource obtained by someone else, you have to be able to figure out which resource to unlock. 
You can't unlock an internal member of a collection that's locked by a depth-inifinity lock without knowing which collection was actually locked. 
CAN'T? 
(going back to an old discussion...) RFC2518, 8.11 says [1]: "The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in the Lock-Token request header from the Request-URI, and all other resources included in the lock. 
If all resources which have been locked under the submitted lock token can not be unlocked then the UNLOCK request MUST fail. 
So do we have agreement that *any* of the URIs affected by a deep lock can 
be used to do the UNLOCK operation?

That is fine with me. 
Cheers, Geoff

Yes. (My earlier wording reflected a different confusion about the conversation Geoff and I were having.

In the meantime I can confirm that indeed this is what moddav and Xythos implement (IIS doesn't seem to support deep locks).

Fine with me.
