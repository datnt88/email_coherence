<s> I've created 2 test cases for this issue below They test failure for error001.rdf  </s>
<s> rdf:aboutEach error002.rdf  </s>
<s> rdf:aboutEachPrefix  </s>
<s> I'll also add these to the tests for illegal names in the tests for rdfms-rdf-names-use Dave  </s>
<s> These look good to me Dave.  </s>
<s> The only nit I have is the use of the dc as it  </s>
<s> makes the test a little more complex and doesn't seem necessary.  </s>
<s> Please can someone else look these over and we will aim to approve this week.  </s>

<s> It's a toss-up here; the files certainly contain bits of syntax which are no longer valid, so we've got two choices: 1. RDF documents containing abouteach and abouteachprefix are in error, and are illegal.  </s>
<s> (This is what Dave's examples do).  </s>
<s> 2. Constructions containing abouteach or AEP are rendered impotent, but the files are otherwise parsed as-is, and a warning omitted.  </s>
<s> In this case, those tests should be renamed, Jos' triples confirmed as the results of them, and we flag the tests as raising a warning in each case.  </s>
<s> The "be liberal in what you accept" would lead to answer 2; however, the syntax document now describes an RDF without the appropriate productions, so perhaps answer 1 is correct (and maybe the grammar needs error productions for these?) jan jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol.  </s>
