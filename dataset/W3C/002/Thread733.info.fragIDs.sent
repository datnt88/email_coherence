<s> I downloaded "the latest version" of Tidy which is supposed to be 04 August 2000 however when I run the program it says "vers 30 April 2000".  </s>

<s> I sent a note to Dave Raggett early this month about this issue, at least with regard to the Windows version.  </s>
<s> I gather that he hasn't had a chance to fix it.  </s>
<s> For the Windows version, downloading the source from: ...will get you the current executable as well.  </s>

<s> Sorry about that.  </s>
<s> I fixed this and all should now be well.  </s>
<s> I expect to make the next release in March.  </s>

<s> I downloaded the Windoze version of Tidy from as "tidy -v" I got the following message: "HTML Tidy release date: 30th April 2000"  </s>
<s> I'm a bit confused... per Dave Raggett's reply below, was this already to have been updated, or will it be updated in March?  </s>
<s> I haven't downloaded the source code: up-to-date (novice = scared by compiling) but I did notice that  </s>
<s> TIDY.  </s>
<s> If someone replies to the list, I would appreciate if you could send a copy to my email address below.  </s>
<s> May I take this opportunity to say express my gratitude for an html-tidier world?  </s>

<s> The link you cited is supposed to point at the latest (4 August 2000) version of HTML Tidy, but I see that it still references the 30 April 2000 version.  </s>
<s> Dave?  </s>
<s> You don't need to compile it.  </s>
<s> The ZIP file contains not only the source code but also the Tidy executable (i.e., TIDY.EXE).  </s>
<s> Just extract that one file from the archive after downloading (or unpack the entire ZIP file into a directory, move the TIDY.EXE file out to another location, and delete the rest of the files).  </s>
<s> -- Dave  </s>
<s> I thought I had fixed that months ago.  </s>
<s> Sorry.  </s>
<s> I have just uploaded the 4th August tidy.exe  </s>
<s> file and once the W3C mirrors have been updated all should be well.  </s>
<s> I am working on a new release which I plan to post in March.  </s>
<s> This will add a number of new features, as well as bug fixes.  </s>

<s> I've been using TidyGUI.  </s>
<s> How soon after there is an update to Tidy does TidyGUI get updated?  </s>
<s> Or is TidyGUI set up to use whatever version of Tidy happens to be installed?  </s>
<s> Hello Howard, in my experience, Andr?  </s>
<s> usually updates his TidyGUI within two weeks of a new Tidy release, if not faster.  </s>
<s> Besides that, he posts a notification to this list when it is done.  </s>
