<s> After the main telecon DanC raised the point of how S-B can still be used and how the lexical spaces of datatypes can be referred to.  </s>
<s> Pat suggested that writing xsd:date rdfs:range _:1 dc:Date rdfs:range _:1 could do the job of making the range of dc:Date to be the lexical space of xsd:date.  </s>
<s> I'm contesting this point and making a suggestion.  </s>
<s> As currently defined by the MT, the first statement asserts that image(IEXT(I(xsd:date))) is subset of CEXT(I(_:1)) That is, CEXT(I(_:1)) may contain many other things besides the lexical tokens for dates.  </s>
<s> What we would need, however, is CEXT(I(_:1)) is subset of image(IEXT(I(xsd:date))) i.e. a tighter restriction on the interpretation of _:1.  </s>
<s> Of course, we could define a new property like rdfs:restrictsByImage that has this effect.  </s>
<s> However, I think the most elegant way of handling this issue would be to introduce properties like rdfs:exactRange and rdfs:exactDomain with the "equals" semantics.  </s>
<s> For example, the interpretation for xsd:date rdfs:exactRange _:1 would be image(IEXT(I(xsd:date))) = CEXT(I(_:1)) In fact, these two properties are more powerful than rdfs:range and rdfs:domain or rdfs:restrictByImage altogether.  </s>
<s> For example, my:prop rdfs:exactRange _:1 _:1 rdfs:subClassOf my:Vehicle _:1 rdfs:subClassOf my:Boat achieves the same effect as my:prop rdfs:range my:Vehicle my:prop rdfs:range my:Boat I believe this is could be an issue for the schema subgroup (DanB?) to think about... Sergey  </s>
<s> In general, I would prefer to see a solution that introduces the minimal amount of new vocabulary, though obviously, if we need the new vocabulary to say what we need to say, fine.  </s>
<s> If we can make the union interpretation of rdfs:drange suggested in work, then wouldn't that be preferable?  </s>
<s> As that allows the inline idiom to be used freely with or without datatyping and without any conflict with the other idioms.  </s>
<s> The only thing it doesn't allow one to do is restrict property values to only the lexical space of the datatype (rdfs:drange constrains them to the union of the value and lexical spaces).  </s>
<s> If it actually is needed to constrain the range to the lexical space alone, then I agree that a new vocabulary is needed, but perhaps it would be more economical to introduce a new range property rather than use the shared bNode method.  </s>
<s> E.g. rdfs:range value space only rdfs:lrange lexical space only rdfs:drange union of value space and lexical space Though, we should be sure we want/need such restrictions because while the union treatment of rdfs:drange allows for no conflicts anywhere with arbitrary syndication of RDF graphs, any property with rdfs:drange or rdfs:range and rdfs:lrange for the same datatype will conflict.  </s>
<s> I.e.  </s>

<s> ppp rdfs:drange ddd .  </s>

<s> ppp rdfs:lrange ddd .  </s>
<s> conflict, and ppp rdfs:drange ddd .  </s>
<s> ppp rdfs:lrange ddd .  </s>
<s> conflict.  </s>
<s> Is the union treatment of rdfs:drange enough?  </s>
<s> Or do we need an absolute restriction to the lexical space alone such as a range property like rdfs:lrange would provide?  </s>

<s> Hmmm..... actually, these do conflict, in that if both are defined, only the bNode idioms are valid, since rdfs:range expects/asserts an actual value and a literal (inline idiom) is not a value.  </s>
<s> But I guess this is logical, since if someone is restricting property values only to members of the value space (rdfs:range) then that would of course exclude lexical forms (literals) in the object position.  </s>
<s> Likewise, if one restricts property values only to members of the lexical space (rdfs:lrange) then that would exclude bNode denotation of values in the object position.  </s>
<s> This seems reasonable to me.  </s>
<s> Conflicts arising from merging arbitrary graphs will be part of life on the Semantic Web.  </s>
<s> At least the conflicts between rdfs:range, rdfs:drange, and rdfs:lrange will be obvious, easy to spot, and not completely hidden in the MT machinery.  </s>
<s> Eh? Patrick  </s>
