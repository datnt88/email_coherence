Roy et. al, RFC2396bis [1] Section 3.5 para 4 states: "As such, interpretation of the fragment identifier during a retrieval action is performed solely by the 
user agent; the fragment identifier is not passed to other systems during 
the process of retrieval." 
Is the focus of this sentence on retrieval deliberate - ie. the spec has nothing to say about whether or not fragment identifiers are passed to other systems during operations other than retrieval? 
I'd have expected this prohibition to have been more universal. 
Thanks, Stuart 
Hello Roy, 
I think what Stuart is noting is that a fragment is also not passed for PUT or POST or any other action on the URI via HTTP. 
I am still thinking of a way to rephrase it. 
Perhaps what it should say is that the fragment is not passed to another system upon dereference of the URI? 
Broadly yes, although was trying avoid an HTTP bias. 
The quoted text express the constraint in a protocol independent fashion - to retrieval operation. 
I'm trying to understand why it is so important to state such a constraint wrt to retrieval and whether or not, maybe on the basis of minimal constraint, it was intentionally stated only for retrieval or whether it should be more universally applied. 
Thanks, Stuart 
I'd say that the prohibition must indeed be focused on retrieval. 
There are other applications for which it is vital that a fragment identifier part of a URI be passed to other systems - XML namespaces and passing RDF data come to mind. 
Well, after thinking about this a bit, I've changed my mind. 
I think fragment identifiers are only defined for use with retrieval, because the semantics of the fragment are (supposed to be, at least) defined by the media type of the retrieved result. 
With other operations, there is no clear media type. 
Using fragment identifiers for other purposes, with PUT, POST, or any other operation, shouldn't be defined in the IETF 'Standard'. 
Maybe someone wants to propose some other semantics for fragment identifiers with operations other than retrieval, but I don't think this document is the right place to include those extensions.
