<s> The authoring team for the bindings spec had a discussion of locks and MOVE  </s>
<s> in the context of bindings, and wants to test its conclusions with the mailing list members.  </s>
<s> (For a complete record of the discussion, see the minutes of 8/31/99, accessible from AGREED: For MOVE, if the source resource is locked (the lock is not inherited from a parent collection), the lock moves with it to the destination.  </s>
<s> If the destination resource is locked (the lock is not inherited from a parent collection), its lock is lost.  </s>
<s> For MOVE, if it's the parent collections that are locked, the resource being moved inherits the lock of the destination collection.  </s>
<s> If a collection is MOVEd, and there are some locked resources in that collection, the locks on those resources get moved.  </s>
<s> We don't require support for cross-server MOVEs where the source resource is locked, but we will define an optional lock header for use in responses, so that the destination server can change the lock token and return the new token with its response.  </s>
<s> If the server allows a cross- server MOVE but elects not to return a lock token value, the client can do lock discovery to find it out.  </s>
<s> If a cross-server MOVE is allowed in a case where there are multiple bindings to the source resource, and the source resource is locked, the result will be that the resource is locked on both servers with the same lock token in both places.  </s>
<s> (If the same lock token cannot be used, the MOVE must fail.) For COPY, any locks at the destination are deleted, and no new locks are created at the destination.  </s>
<s> After the COPY, there will be no locks at the destination except what is inherited from above.  </s>
<s> This is a reversal of the position taken in RFC 2518.  </s>
<s> Most people's intuition is that a MOVEd resource is the same resource, with the same state (including its lock state).  </s>
<s> The only rationale that has been presented for having locks be lost after a MOVE is the case of cross-server MOVEs.  </s>
<s> The source server and destination server may use different URI schemes for lock tokens, so that the destination server may be unwilling to keep the same lock token for the MOVEd resource.  </s>
<s> We can make support for cross-server MOVEs of locked resources optional, and allow the destination server to replace the lock token with a different lock token.  </s>
<s> We'll provide a response header for it to use to report the new lock token.  </s>
<s> AGREED: We'll change the language related to protecting the Request-URI to SHOULD.  </s>
<s> We intend this to protect the entire path, including the final segment.  </s>
<s> This does impact the definition of write locks in RFC 2518, which will have to change.  </s>
<s> It's no longer that a write lock MUST prevent MOVE and DELETE, but that it SHOULD prevent them.  </s>
<s> This discussion began with Yaron's comment that saying that "it MUST NOT be possible for a principal other than the lock owner to make a locked resource inaccessible via the URI mapping used to lock the resource" is too strong.  </s>
<s> It may make sense for write locks as defined in RFC 2518, but may not make sense for other sorts of locks that don't restrict MOVE and DELETE.  </s>
<s> The user expectation would be that the Request-URI used to lock the resource would continue to work for the duration of the lock, so we should go as far as is practical toward protecting the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> Locks can disappear anyhow due to administrator actions, and it is quite unlikely that anyone will interfere with the Request-URI while a lock is in force, so it's ok to weaken the normative language from "MUST NOT" to "SHOULD NOT".  </s>
<s> But we want to be consistent for the whole Request-URI.  </s>
<s> That would mean weakening the definition of write lock in RFC 2518, so that a write lock only SHOULD prevent other principals from MOVE or DELETE on the locked resource, not MUST.  </s>

<s> It might be better if, rather than using "*", you defined an all/ element meaning the same thing.  </s>
<s> For now, "*" is simple enough; but, if we add more wildcards eventually, then it gets messier; we'd have to add more possible values, which starts getting into defining a separate syntax, with a separate parser.  </s>
<s> Simpler to use XML tags and let the existing parser handle it.  </s>
