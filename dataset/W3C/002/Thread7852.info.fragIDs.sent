I've added Daniel's email address to the accept2 list, so future emails from him will go through to the list. 
He's not on the list (as far as I know), so you should include him in any replies. 
- Jim Good evening from Paris, I am working on the draft of an article that will handle the future interoperation of systems and protocols on the Internet. 
Concerning DAV, my specific question is... Windows and the Office Pack are already integrating Web Folders and WebDAV as a network based file handling system, so growing it to a fully functional File System is the next natural step. 
Are there trends or is there any incipient project sketch for the integration of DAV as a *nix transparent file system like NFS or SMB? 
Should this be done, the maturity of the DAV protocol and its spreading among the user community could be greatly augmented. 
Comment or criticise, but please make a CC to dali@dali-designs.com 
Thank you, Daniel Bodea 
Indeed, Mac OS X will ship with a WebDAV client file system. 
A preliminary version shipped in Mac OS X Beta.

Is it included in Darwin?

I'm not familiar with the details of the implementation, but Apple's iTools product for Mac OS 9.x also appears to use WebDAV.
