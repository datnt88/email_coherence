<s> In the DAV spec, the examples of XML all show the XML processing instruction  </s>
<s> as Shouldn't that be with a trailing question mark?  </s>
<s> Reason I ask is that I'm actually trying the examples in the spec and get  </s>
<s> an error with that processing instruction.  </s>
<s> But it could be that my XML parser is flaky -- it is not from any known-reliable source.  </s>
<s> Jim, Good catch.  </s>
<s> You are correct, the spec.  </s>
<s> should have a terminating "? ".  </s>
<s> Also, I note that in the current version of the XML specification, the "XML" has been changed to lowercase.  </s>
<s> The BNF productions for the XML version can be found in Section 2.8, Prolog and Document Type Declaration, of the XML specification.  </s>
<s> The version number is part of the XML declaration, which is part of a document's prolog.  </s>
<s> I will ammend the specification so each XML example begins with: - Jim On Friday, December 12, 1997 1:14 PM, Jim Davis  </s>
