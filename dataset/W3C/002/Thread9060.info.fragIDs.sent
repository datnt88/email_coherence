<s> Joseph, please find attached four additional test cases for C14N and EC14N.  </s>
<s> Each test file is XML and contains: - The XML to be filtered with an XPath Transform according to XMLDSIG - The XPath to be applied to the XML - The intended output of canonicalizing the result of the XPath transform with C14N, together with annotations what the test case should show - The intended output of canonicalizing the result of the XPath transform with EXC-C14N, together with annotations what the test case should show So, the following steps are necessary to use the test cases: 1. Get the bytes of the test case file  </s>
<s> 2. Apply a XPath Transform with the appropriate XPath (specified in a comment in the test case file)  </s>
<s> 3. Apply C14N and EXC-C14N respectively to the result of the XPath Transform.  </s>
<s> 4. Compare the result of C14N and EXC-C14N respectively with the intended result shown as comment in the test case file.  </s>

<s> Hi Gregor,  </s>
<s> I'm a little confused on this note.  </s>
<s> When I pass your xpath expression  </s>
<s> test_c14n.py -i iaikTests.example1.xml  </s>
<s> -x "self::Parent or (parent::Parent and not(self::Child)) or self::GrandChild or parent::GrandChild" I get a (not very useful) error [1].  </s>
<s> But I'd still expect and error because I'm not sure which BNF productions you are expecting this XPath expression to match?  </s>
<s> However, the following does work and agrees with your result for test 1: test_c14n.py  </s>
<s> -e -i iaikTests.example1.xml  </s>
<s> -x "(//.  </s>
<s> | //@* | //namespace::*)[self::Parent or (parent::Parent and not(self::Child)) or self::GrandChild or parent::GrandChild]" [1] _in_subset = lambda subset, node: subset is None or node in subset TypeError: 'in' or 'not in' needs sequence right argument  </s>
<s> Joseph, the XPaths I have provided for my examples are node tests in the sense of the XPath Transform specified in XMLDSIG.  </s>
<s> So, if you take the well-known ;-) "//.  </s>

<s> my XPath expression as its node test, you should get the right results.  </s>

<s> Palani, the additionalNSPrefixes tell you which namespaces the prefixes used in the XPath expression are bound to.  </s>
<s> Where to use it depends on how you evaluate the XPath expression: In the default case, Xalan uses the context node to resolve prefixes in the XPath epression: The namespace declarations in scope for the context nodes are used to determine the namespace a prefix is bound to.  </s>
<s> If this is not sufficient for your scenario, you have to provide your  </s>
<s> own implementation of the interface org.apache.xml.utils.PrefixResolver;  </s>
<s> best is to derive from class org.apache.xml.utils.PrefixResolverDefault, which is the default resolver Xalan uses.  </s>
<s> You can tell Xalan to use your prefix resolver by using constructor org.apache.xpath.XPath(String,  </s>

<s> In terms of API for our own (thtis WG's) tests, I'd prefer that the parameter be a string of white space delimited series of prefix:values and '#default' be the key word, but whomever sends the tests dictates their form.  </s>
