<s> Try: $ tidy tst.html ...and see if you get the proper output on the screen.  </s>
<s> If so, then Tidy is having problems writing the corrected output back to the file.  </s>
<s> If not, then the trouble is elsewhere.  </s>
<s> That's due to the way Tidy works.  </s>
<s> Basically, Tidy reads the input file and creates a parse tree.  </s>
<s> After the input file is completely processed, Tidy walks the parse tree and prints to the output file as it goes.  </s>
<s> Pretty- printing options simply modify the way Tidy does the printing.  </s>
<s> The "markup" option is perhaps confusingly named.  </s>
<s> "Markup: no" should be interpreted as "don't output any markup during processing," i.e., don't produce any output except Tidy diagnostics.  </s>
<s> It should, in the absence of any implied configuration file.  </s>
<s> Note that Tidy will process: 1.  </s>
<s> A configuration filename supplied on the command line.  </s>
<s> 2. A configuration filename designated by the HTML_TIDY environment variable.  </s>
<s> 3. A ".tidyrc" file, if present in the HOME directory.  </s>
<s> 4. A compiled-in default filename, if defined.  </s>

<s> Once I unset that variable, things seem to work again.  </s>
<s> I wonder if the argument setting is really working as expected; I would have expected command line flags to override everything else - AND I would expect a command line flag to turn on or off the generation of that markup argument.  </s>

<s> The various configuration file options accumulate, if I recall correctly, so "-config /dev/null" doesn't change anything because there aren't any options specified.  </s>
<s> The order in which configuration options are applied is: compiled-in default, then environment variable OR then ".tidyrc", then command-line options in order of appearance, including the "config" option.  </s>
<s> Note that if the environment variable is defined, ".tidyrc" will not be checked.  </s>
<s> If you use "--markup yes" from the command line, that would override a previous "markup: no" in any configuration file previously encountered.  </s>
<s> Also, the "-errors" and "-e" command option is the same as "markup: no".  </s>
<s> Wouldn't that just be a case of selecting the desired options in your configuration file?  </s>
