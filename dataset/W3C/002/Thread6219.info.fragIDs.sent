<s> It would appear that we could be in danger of allowing the term 'Semantic Web' fall into the hands of the marketing people slightly sooner than we had hoped.  </s>
<s> I suspect the majority of you who've had reservations over using the term in the past feel that we could be running before we can walk.  </s>
<s> This is true.  </s>
<s> We do need to be careful in our classifications of the technologies we are developing.  </s>
<s> I would like to cite a recent discussion I had with some colleagues at work.  </s>
<s> I tried to present to them RDF using the angle of what the technology could hold for developing a network of metadata (or a 'semantic web', if you will).  </s>
<s> Although my presentation started as just that - a presentation - we quickly lapsed into discussions about where RDF can and probably will go.  </s>
<s> The opinion of some very experienced people - whom have seen the rise and fall of previous 'killer technologies' - seemed to think that RDF wouldn't be used for the purposes of describing web pages, etc. Rather, that it would still be successful, but probably be employed in some other technology probably totally unrelated to realising the 'semantic web' vision.  </s>
<s> Such as the rise and fall of HTML, from its initial incarnation to the presentational-emphasis language we have today.  </s>
<s> As a student of the field, I'd consider my opinions and views fresh and relatively untainted, and I tend to agree with my colleagues.  </s>
<s> RDF just seems too complex to be adopted my the masses for the purpose it was intended.  </s>
<s> The technology is so powerful, however, that it will almost certainly find a purpose somewhere.  </s>
<s> If, however, we can limit the contact people have to have with raw RDF (or even raw semantic modelling - to a certain extent) through well-designed, user-friendly, powerful applications, then we can help stop the RDF drift away from where it would do most good, and help realise the technology.  </s>

<s> The word mechanics reminds me of the interplay between "statistical mechanics" and thermodynamics.  </s>
<s> The first describes phenomena on the micro level and the second on the macro level.  </s>
<s> Small scale bits like XML/RDF are the substrate of any scheme to build a semantic level.  </s>
<s> In reality, I cannot see how an idea such as "user driven semantics" would work in terms of how RDF evolves.  </s>

<s> To me, one of the most intriguing aspects of TBL's description of a Semantic Web is the parallel with the *flaws* of the WWW.  </s>
<s> There were many people in the 80's working on hypermedia systems, and a significant reason that they stalled and the WWW took off is that they cared about ensuring consistency, bidirectional links, etc., and Tim was willing to let go of that.  </s>
<s> The result is  1 billion WWW pages, and probably  10 billion links.  </s>
<s> A small percentage of the pages are broken, but on the whole the WWW provides tremendous value.  </s>
<s> Similarly, I view most of what has been done in AI as focused on consistency, correctness, etc., which (so far) has limited the successes it can claim.  </s>
<s> If you're looking for a Semantic Web that can give you  </s>
<s> "truth", we've got a long wait.  </s>
<s> If you're looking for something that improves search results through related concepts and simple inferences, in  </s>
<s> a few years you should be able to get something that's useful, but not  </s>

<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Well, I was trying to cover myself :-) I'm imagining that first a group of technologists has to "agree" on some kind of standard, and then their work has to be adopted by a large enough group of webmasters for the whole thing to be "useful".  </s>
<s> However, because the Web is described by Zipf's law [1], you might get good value out of convincing "only" the top 100 sites (in page views) to  </s>

<s> Is this not a serious "flaw"?  </s>
<s> Rule based systems, yes that was a requirement that was in fact often missing.  </s>
<s> Many other appraoches had no need for consistency (e.g. genetic algorithms).  </s>

<s> The web is now a commercial playground, not a research "sandbox".  </s>

<s> Jakob Nielsen shows that both "page requests" (for a site such as "The figure shows incoming page-requests to a single site.  </s>
<s> Other studies have found that Zipf curves characterize the outgoing page requests from the employees of an organization (there are a few pages that everybody look at and a large number of pages that are seen only once)."  </s>
<s> So the law applies for "page popularity" plotted against "hits per month" (his terminology).  </s>
