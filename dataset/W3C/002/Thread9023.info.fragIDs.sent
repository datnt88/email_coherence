<s> Hi all, We 'flattened' the nodes because that is, in essence, what serialization is doing.  </s>
<s> The real question is why does every node have to be in a node-set in order for it to appear in the serialization, i.e. why can't we just refer to an entire subtree.  </s>
<s> Before I answer, I would point out that XPointer is based on XPath, and XPath has the same capability w.r.t. its possible use for indicating  </s>
<s> subtrees rather than individual nodes (e.g. its use in XSLT, which does not need all descendants because it can naturally recurse when necessary).  </s>
<s> In other words, XPath is a tool for indicating node-sets.  </s>
<s> The node sets can be interpreted in any way necessary according to the needs of the consuming application (they could be considered as the roots of subtrees, individual nodes, or the heads of sublists of siblings, ...) Anyway, we selected to interpret the result of an XPath as indicating individual nodes to be serialized.  </s>
<s> This is legal under the  </s>
<s> interpretation of the word "set".  </s>
<s> Indeed, it is even possible to do this with XPointer (location-set), and I advocated this at one point, but the group decided against using XPointer only because we wanted a shorter time to REC (though this was over a year ago!).  </s>
<s> Aside from legality, the individual node interpretation of XPath results was necesssary in order to implement the notion of signature filters, which specify the portion of a document to be signed and/or the portion to be omitted, the latter being inherently more secure.  </s>
<s> I did an RSA 2000 presentation on this issue and numerous emails exist in the archive about 'document closure'.  </s>
<s> The basic idea is that if you specify the portions of a document covered by a signature, then it is easy to add to the document without breaking the signature.  </s>
<s> It becomes very difficult to assess whether the additions have an implicit impact on the signed material.  </s>
<s> By comparison, if a signature says "sign everything except X, Y, Z" then additions other than X, Y and/or Z will break the signature.  </s>
<s> It is comparatively easier to establish the security of a message if all you have to prove is that X, Y and Z cannot cause a security problem within the application domain (or that any such possibility is covered by post-core-validation application-specific steps).  </s>
<s> In essence, we made easy things a little harder to say so that we could make hard things possible to say.  </s>
<s> Finally, as to the speed issue that the originator is experiencing, I'd say he is suffering from a non-optimized implementation.  </s>
<s> The reason is that an O(n) traversal of the nodes of a parse tree is sufficient for including all such nodes in a node-set.  </s>
<s> Since all members of the node-set will be rendered in a serialization, the cost is O(n).  </s>
<s> Thus, the cost of putting all nodes in a node-set should (or can at least) be commensurate with serialization.  </s>
<s> If it is taking progressively longer to calculate the node-set as the XML document grows, then the XPath implementation needs to be optimized.  </s>
<s> Alternately, we only require behavior equivalent to the evaluation of the (//.  </s>
<s> | //@* | //namespace::*) expression.  </s>
