When running HTMLTidy from NoteTab Pro, I get the following error: Error: Can't open ""C:\TIDY\config.cfg"" 
Info: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" Info: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 0 warnings, 1 error were found! 
This document has errors that must be fixed before 
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version. 
To learn more about HTML Tidy see http://tidy.sourceforge.net 
Please send bug reports to html-tidy@w3.org 
HTML and CSS specifications are available from http://www.w3.org/ Lobby your company to join W3C, see http://www.w3.org/Consortium Coming from a programming background, my gut feeling is that the nested double quotes are probably gumming up the works. 
At any rate, the necessary config file is where it's supposed to be, and it's not read-only. 
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Hmm, change how NoteTab Pro calls HTML Tidy or use a different editor? 
Why do you consider HTML Tidy beeing the problem? 
First, this may be more a NoteTab problem than a Tidy problem, so you might get better answers in the NoteTab mailing list at NoteTab expects the config file to be "Tidy.cfg" in the NoteTab Pro directory. 
Where it's picking up that ""C:\TIDY\config.cfg"" from is beyond me -- have you by some chance set an environment variable (i.e., HTML_TIDY) that overrides the default? 
If so, I would either remove that variable altogether and use the default location and name, or remove the extra double quotes around the path name.
