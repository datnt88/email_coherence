<s> Howard's Comments on Requirements Howard  </s>
<s> Section 2.0 - Introduction  </s>
<s> "Native operating system methodsare ineffective because the users  </s>
<s> responsible for modifyinginformation on the Web site are generally not  </s>
<s> logged ininteractively to the server in a manner that maps their  </s>
<s> identityto a local user-id."  </s>
<s> While I am aware of systems, such as FrontPage, which create user-ids  </s>
<s> that only exist for FrontPage and not the underlying system, the  </s>
<s> majority of web servers I am familiar with map web based authentication  </s>
<s> directly to user IDs.  </s>
<s> The use of the clear text password challenge is  </s>
<s> often used to map users to their UNIX Ids and the use of NTLM is widely  </s>
<s> used in NT environments to map users to their accounts.  </s>
<s> I think the next  </s>
<s> sentence, regarding different types of ACL systems is strong enough to  </s>
<s> justify the existence of this draft, the sentence quoted above is not,  </s>
<s> in my opinion, needed.  </s>
<s> "The "htaccess" file utilized on many Web Servers todaydeals principally with read permission, and is unsuitable for themore complex access control issues that exist in the distributedauthoring environment."  </s>
<s> Howard, I second your comment that this sentence is dated and should be  </s>
<s> removed.  </s>
<s> "This document describes requirements for a set of methods which could  </s>
<s> be implemented within the framework of the proposedHTTP standard for the following:" Howard, I second your comment that the word "methods" should be changed to "mechanisms".  </s>
<s> One of the lessons we learned from our work on the DAV requirements document is that a good requirements document does not  </s>
<s> proscribe how something is achieved, only the requirement that it be  </s>
<s> achieved.  </s>
<s> ": Creation and modification of security policies: Assignment of  </s>
<s> security policies to resources: Querying for policy information on a  </s>
<s> resource: Types of standard access control types" Howard, I agree with your comment that having a list such as the one above is a good thing.  </s>
<s> However I have some serious reservations about the definitions of the term "security policies".  </s>
<s> That issue is further addressed below.  </s>
<s> Section 3 - Terminology  </s>
<s> I think the term principal should be defined in DAV and, at best,  </s>
<s> repeated verbatim in the ACL draft.  </s>
<s> I also believe a definition should  </s>
<s> be provided for both policy and ACL.  </s>
<s> As I have learned talking to different folks about security there are a lot of subtle differences in  </s>
<s> the way people use security terms.  </s>
<s> For example I use the word ACL in a  </s>
<s> way that most folks use the word ACE.  </s>
<s> Also, I agree with your comments  </s>
<s> that we will have to require the definition of some sort of  </s>
<s> extensibility mechanism along with some basic access controls.  </s>
<s> I believe  </s>
<s> you are dead on when you say that just passing around blobs that will  </s>
<s> get defined at some point in the future buys us nothing.  </s>
<s> This having been said I would like to see the terms Application and Server Based Application both stricken from the terminology section.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> definitions aren't, in my opinion, useful.  </s>
<s> Section 4 - General Principles I agree that this section requires significant work.  </s>
<s> Also, URLs are generally opaque to clients.  </s>
<s> Servers spit them out,  </s>
<s> clients just move them around.  </s>
<s> I suggest we follow the same rule when it  </s>
<s> comes to identifying principals.  </s>
<s> The requirement document should not require that principals can generate or even dissect principal identifiers.  </s>
<s> Rather I suggest we intentionally leave undefined how it is  </s>
<s> a principal comes into possession of a principal identifier.  </s>
<s> In fact I would suggest we stick to the agreements made at the Orem meeting that the DAV ACL mechanism would ignore issues of how principal  </s>
<s> identifiers are created or what they represent and instead define what a  </s>
<s> principal can do once they have such an identifier and the authorization  </s>
<s> to use it.  </s>
<s> Section 5.1 - Setting of Access Not to be picky but can we please use the word "control" instead of "constraints"?  </s>
<s> I believe the later to be common usage.  </s>
<s> We also need a  </s>
<s> very detailed definition of what an access control is.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, we don't know what it is we are requiring.  </s>
<s> Section 5.2 - Inheritance I am not clear as to what problem is introduced into the protocol by lazy inheritance.  </s>
<s> Inheritance is a mechanism to specify ACL information  </s>
<s> for resources within a certain scope.  </s>
<s> If a resource is available in the  </s>
<s> scope, regardless of how it got there, then it is expected to have the  </s>
<s> specified ACL information.  </s>
<s> So, examining the situation strictly from the  </s>
<s> view "on the wire" there is no discernable difference between lazy and  </s>
<s> normal inheritance.  </s>
<s> As such we should be able to specify them the same  </s>
<s> way.  </s>
<s> Either way I do not believe we can escape inheritance.  </s>
<s> Just about every  </s>
<s> ACL system I am aware of, from UNIX to the high end document management  </s>
<s> servers support inheritance as a way for someone to allow controlled access to creation capabilities within their namespace.  </s>
<s> Section 5.3 - Reporting to Server-Based Applications I believe this section is inappropriate to a protocol requirements document and should be removed.  </s>
<s> We are dealing strictly with the  </s>
<s> protocol definition and the expected behaviors from the commands passed  </s>
<s> through that protocol.  </s>
<s> How those behaviors get enforced on the server is  </s>
<s> out of scope for both the requirements and the protocol.  </s>
<s> Section 5.4 - Access Control [Judy: for Access Constraints] Ahh the snake biting its own tail.  </s>
<s> I would recommend that the  </s>
<s> requirements only state that there be a way to control who has the right  </s>
<s> to change access controls.  </s>
<s> The actual form of that mechanism should be  </s>
<s> left to the protocol group.  </s>
<s> Section 5.5 - Standard Access Attributes  </s>
<s> While I think it is appropriate for the requirements document to mandate  </s>
<s> that some set of rights MUST be supported by all servers I additional  </s>
<s> believe that we need to make it clear that it is up to the protocol to  </s>
<s> decide how to group these rights.  </s>
<s> For example we may create a "list"  </s>
<s> right which provides both the rights Judy lists in section 5.5.2 rather  </s>
<s> then two separate rights.  </s>
<s> The final decision should remain with the protocol designers.  </s>
<s> Section 5.6 - Discovery "Plain"?  </s>
<s> I think that term is inappropriate.  </s>
<s> I believe the requirements  </s>
<s> document should restrict itself to specify that discovery must be possible through a mechanism that is capable of producing machine processable output.  </s>
<s> Human readable descriptions, in my experience, actually hinder rather than help interoperability.  </s>
<s> A goal referenced  </s>
<s> several times through out the ACL requirements document is the desire to have webdav tools be able to interact with multiple systems.  </s>
<s> It is only by carefully defining every word and utterance that these tools can be  </s>
<s> sure of providing their users of a consistent, well defined, experience.  </s>
<s> When we start to require 'Human readable' viewing then we remove the ability for the tool to frame the user's experience and we hinder the cause of interoperability as natural language is significantly less well  </s>
<s> defined than a well defined schema.  </s>
<s> Additional requiring a "human readable" view for webdav compliant devices that engage exclusively in machine to machine community, such as a printer on a network, is inappropriate.  </s>
<s> Over all I find myself in general agreement with Howard's comments.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> Yaron,  </s>
<s> What you're saying is often true for intranets, but is often not true for  </s>
<s> extranets or ISPs.  </s>
<s> How about if we change it to:  </s>
<s> "Native operating system methods are not always applicable because web server user identities are not always mapped to native operating system  </s>
<s> identities, especially in situations where the web server may be accessed by  </s>
<s> users outside of the enterprise which maintains it."  </s>
<s> It might also be reasonable to add:  </s>
<s> "In many cases, web server access control is based on the IP addresses or  </s>
<s> DNS names of clients.  </s>
<s> Native operating systems do not generally support  </s>
<s> this type of access control on a per-resource basis."  </s>
<s> A fundamental question for our access control requirements is whether the  </s>
<s> protocol should support this type of access control.  </s>
<s> I'd vote yes, simply  </s>
<s> because it is widely used.  </s>
<s> It could be argued that we should take a stand  </s>
<s> for better security and deprecate this practice by not supporting it, but  </s>
<s> who is to say that IP addresses and DNS names will not be more secure in the  </s>
<s> future?  </s>
<s> Does a "principal" consist of a user identity, as determined by some  </s>
<s> authentication method, or does it also take into account client IP address,  </s>
<s> DNS name, and possibly other properties?  </s>
<s> Is a principal defined by a  </s>
<s> description in terms of attributes, or is defined as a specific,  </s>
<s> authenticated user identity?  </s>
<s> Going, going...  </s>
<s> While I understand and agree with a desire to support "open user authentication", I don't see that this by itself implies that references to user identities should not be standardized in the access control protocol.  </s>
<s> Once a user has authenticated to a server in some way, the server could map  </s>
<s> the authenticated identity to a WebDAV-specified form of user reference.  </s>
<s> Access control policy could be conveyed between client and server, using this standardized form of reference to users.  </s>
<s> The need to reference unique user identities goes beyond access control per  </s>
<s> se. I notice that for purposes of identifying a lock owner, XML is used (section 5.6.2.5 of the DAV spec).  </s>
<s> If a client program wants to compare user identities for equality, for example, to test if the current user is the lock owner, how is that done?  </s>
<s> It seems that the XML user reference must  </s>
<s> contain some component that uniquely identifies a user with respect to the server, and the client must understand enough about the particular XML schema being used to compare the appropriate parts of the XML text in an appropriate way.  </s>
<s> No doubt this is a hard problem, and one for which I don't claim to have all the answers, but just specifying an XML representation, while wonderful for extensibility, does not seem to advance the cause of interoperability much.  </s>
<s> I prefer "access control" myself, but the more important thing is to define what it is, as you suggest.  </s>
<s> I understand/like models with ACLs made up of ACEs, with each ACE allowing or denying specified access rights under certain specified conditions, which usually have to do with attributes of the client user, potentially including references to authenticated user identities.  </s>
<s> Are there any alternative proposals?  </s>
<s> Lazy inheritance need not affect the protocol design if we so choose.  </s>
<s> However, I think that means that when viewing the access control on a resource, you would not see or be able to set any lazily inherited controls from a WebDAV client, although you would still be subject to these controls when attempting to access the resource.  </s>
<s> That would tend to relegate the administration of lazily inherited controls to server administrators, or encourage proprietary extensions to WebDAV to enable end-user administration.  </s>
<s> I have no problem with that.  </s>
<s> If the access control protocol does convey lazily inherited access control  </s>
<s> information between client and server, then it must, at a minimum, provide a  </s>
<s> mechanism to distinguish between access controls which are directly bound to a resource and those which are lazily inherited.  </s>
<s> It may also be necessary to distinguish between types of access control placed on a collection, as applying to the collection itself, or applying (via lazy inheritance) to resources in the collection.  </s>
<s> With internal and external members of collections, there is a potential for even finer distinctions.  </s>
<s> I don't disagree, but the inheritance model needs to be elucidated, even if it's just to say that inheritance is server-specific and outside the scope of this protocol design.  </s>
<s> Even with that statement, I'd add: 1) The WebDAV access protocol conveys only access controls which are directly bound to, and applicable to accesses to, a given resource.  </s>
<s> There may be access controls bound to a resource which do not affect accesses to the resource, and there may be access controls which are not directly bound to the resource, which nevertheless may affect accesses to the resource.  </s>
<s> Rationale: Allows servers to implement lazy inheritance of access controls, if desired.  </s>
<s> 2) Access controls may be implicitly bound to a resource as a side-effect of resource creation, through mechanisms outside the scope of this specification.  </s>
<s> Rationale: Allows servers to implement non-lazy (got a better word?) inheritance of access controls, if desired.  </s>
<s> One could replace "inheritance" with "assignment" in the above, and it would be less biased toward the mechanism of inheritance, per se.  </s>
<s> Going, going...  </s>
<s> Well, that's fine with me, but won't the protocol group's first question about this be: what is the requirement?  </s>
<s> If access controls are allowed on viewing/setting access controls, there must be some way to end the potential recursion, and if attachment of access controls by reference is allowed, then cycles should be prohibited.  </s>
<s> I'd say that server implementors ought to be able limit how many levels of this they'll support, including not supporting it at all.  </s>
<s> What access control applies to the most meta of the access controls should also be left to the implementor.  </s>
<s> So I'd propose a requirement: "The protocol must provide an optional mechanism for setting access controls on the viewing and setting of access controls, but need not (and probably should not) support cyclic bindings.  </s>
<s> The protocol should provide a mechanism for a server to reject such an operation as unsupported, and ideally provide a way for the client to determine, without side-effects, whether the server supports this operation, and if so, how many levels are supported."  </s>
<s> Or, if the group prefers: "There is no requirement for the protocol to enable access controls to be set on the viewing and setting of other access controls.  </s>
<s> The mechanisms for administering the controls on the viewing and setting of access controls are outside the scope of the protocol."  </s>
<s> The list of standard access attributes seems to me to be a requirements issue, although I can imagine valid reasons for postponing the decision.  </s>
<s> Could you elaborate on why you think it should be deferred?  </s>
<s> By the way, is there a good reason to call these "access attributes" instead of "access rights"?  </s>
<s> I notice that you seem to prefer "rights", as do I. I guess if your model of ACEs is: if attribute-expression then allow/deny where rights may be part of the attribute-expression , e.g.: if (access-type=read AND dns="*.foo.com")  </s>
<s> OR (access-type=modify) then deny then these rights might behave just like other attributes which might be used in the attribute-expression .  </s>
<s> But then I would use "access attributes" to refer to all of the kinds of attributes that may appear in the attribute-expression , and refer to the rights as "rights", or maybe "access types".  </s>
<s> Personally, I prefer a model of ACEs that is more like: if attribute-expression then allow/deny rights which makes it a little easier to sort out the ACEs that apply to a particular access type and to understand their effect..  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> The rationale:  </s>
<s> 5.6.1 Rationale It will be necessary for WebDAV tools to understand what the WebDAV server understands insofar as access control, as well as a description in human-readable terms of how the server will treat changes to a particular access control [Judy: constraint].  </s>
<s> seems to imply that software interpretation, as well as human-readability are required.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the text of 5.6.1 belongs in 5.6, and a new 5.6.1 is needed, one which would justify the need for each of these.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the requirement for human-readability should actually be a requirement for a textual representation, suggesting the use of XML, without making a value judgment about its readability.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback.  </s>
<s> Howard  </s>
<s> Section 2.0 - Introduction - I would like to see something along the lines of the following two sentences appear in the requirements document: "The protocol MUST NOT place any restrictions on the content of principal identifiers" and "This protocol MUST NOT restrict or influence choice of authentication mechanism."  </s>
<s> This gets us out of the business of worrying about IP based authentication or what have you.  </s>
<s> BTW there are certain intranet scenarios where IP based authentication is totally appropriate.  </s>
<s> As for your suggested alternative text, I can live with them as motivating statements for the two requirements list above.  </s>
<s> Section 3.0 - Terminology - Damn Damn Damn Damn the definition ended up somewhere on the editing room floor.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly had a really good definition that we stole but it seems to have fallen out of the spec.  </s>
<s> Jim, do we still have it around?  </s>
<s> In a nutshell a principal is ANY authenticated entity.  </s>
<s> The method of authentication is completely undefined and principal identifiers are treated as opaque tokens by the protocol.  </s>
<s> The client and/or server may understand it but the protocol does not need to.  </s>
<s> The ACL spec comes in once identification and authentication have been dealt with.  </s>
<s> Section 4.0 - General Principals - What is the compelling reason for requiring principal identifiers to always be non-opaque?  </s>
<s> I can see the reason why sometimes it would be extremely useful to have non-opaque principal identifiers but I do not see the compelling reason why the ACL protocol would need to require the use of such non-opaque identifiers in order to execute all of its duties.  </s>
<s> Section 5.1 - Access Control - I don't know if there are alternative proposals but Paul Leach and I will be submitting this week a protocol draft which meets the requirements of the requirement draft as it now stands and is based on ACEs.  </s>
<s> That is, of course, just one proposal.  </s>
<s> However I thought it would be useful to let people see what this stuff looks like when implemented on top of DAV.  </s>
<s> BTW the proposal WILL support having ACLs on properties.  </s>
<s> Section 5.2 - Inheritance - I basically agree across the board, except that I believe the protocol MUST specify inheritance in the case of creating a new resource.  </s>
<s> Additionally, given the design of DAV I don't believe that ACLs can apply to external members, external members are records not resources.  </s>
<s> That having been said one could apply ACLs to the ability to create and remove external members.  </s>
<s> Section 5.4 - ACLs on the ability to set/view ACLs - Oh major ick.  </s>
<s> I can live with the language but I would bet money that the final protocol will support an ACL which controls the ability to set/view ACLs.  </s>
<s> I think it is o.k. to let certain issues "hang out" for a while until the group has had some time to chew over the ideas.  </s>
<s> This is just the first official version of the draft.  </s>
<s> Section 5.5 - ACE Model - I actually prefer a model more along the lines of principal- grant- right, right, right, right, ... - deny- right, right, right, right, ... The decision to grant or deny is completely based on authentication of the principal, how that happens is outside the scope of the ACL protocol.  </s>
<s> Section 5.6 - Discovery - What is the compelling reason for a text requirement?  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> 5.6.1 Rationale It will be necessary for WebDAV tools to understand what the WebDAV server understands insofar as access control, as well as a  </s>
<s> in human-readable terms of how the server will treat changes to a particular access control [Judy: constraint].  </s>
