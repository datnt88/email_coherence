Hi Folks, I've added the decisions made to the face to face page at: and notes from the i18n meeting. 
I don't intend to do any more minutes than this and will be seeking approval of the minutes at this Friday's telecon.

Shouldn't that be *NOT* start with a combining character? 
I18N suggests that comparison of URI's behaves as if they are UNICODE normalised, but not does require that such normalization is performed. 
I18N agree that RDFCore requires a transitive string comparison algorithm and requests that the specs do not mislead application developers into thinking they are not permitted to implement a more flexible string matching algorithm, e.g. on queries. 
I18N note that the strings defining languages occasionally change and suggests that RDFCore may choose to use URI's to name languages. 
RDFCore agree to consider. 
I18N found the proposed solution of literals being a pair of a string and a language tag acceptable. 
I18N agree that n-triples is an internal tool for the WG and developers and is not subject to the same internationization concerns of more public syntaxes. 
I18N request that the specs make this limited role for n-triples clear. 
There was some dicussion of RDFCore concerns of lack of implementation of charmod and other specs delaying completion of RDFCore. 
I think there was also a concern that the relevant I18N specs would not be at the appropriate recommendation status when the RDF specs are ready to move forward.

Thanks Graham. 
Fixed.

JOKE: We could ensure that by putting in a large number of last call comments. 
Somewhat more seriously ... At this stage I am planning to make a last call comment on charmod's 2nd last call to the effect that the existence of royalty free normalizing transcoders for a large number of character encodings should be an exit criterion for charmod CR. 
I believe that charmod's 2nd last call may get out before we do. 
I believe we are progressing faster than charmod.
