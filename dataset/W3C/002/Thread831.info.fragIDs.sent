<s> I am a first time website creator.  </s>
<s> I created several pages using HTML.  </s>
<s> I used notepad to write all my code.  </s>
<s> I then changed my code to follow the XHTML specifications (I think).  </s>
<s> I have not obtained a server yet, so I can't go to your site and put in my URL address.  </s>
<s> I have downloaded a copy of html Tidy.exe  </s>
<s> I would like to use HTML Tidy to see if my code is written correctly.  </s>
<s> I have visited your website to see if I can figure out how to use HTML Tidy, but I believe I am too basic in DOS (and probably web knowledge) to follow the instructions on your site.  </s>
<s> Can you please help me.  </s>
<s> I appreciate that you usually deal with people more knowledgeable with HTML and DOS than I am, and you may not be able to help me.  </s>
<s> However, if you can I would appreciate it greatly.  </s>

<s> Does the info on URL:http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/faq.html#what-now help?  </s>
<s> If not, it might be worthwhile to download a text editor that integrates easily with HTML Tidy, like NoteTab or HTML-Kit.  </s>
<s> Or use this graphical front-end for HTML Tidy: If you don't like having choices | Rijk van Geijtenbeek made for you, you should start | Documentation &amp; QA making your own.  </s>
<s> - Neal Stephenson | mailto:rijk@opera.com  </s>
<s> You can either run Tidy in a console window from the command line, or you may prefer to use a tool the provides a GUI front end.  </s>
<s> You can find several of these linked off the SourceForge page at: Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>
