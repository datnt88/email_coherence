<s> Title: Binding Extensions to WebDAV Author(s): G. Clemm, J. Crawford et al. Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-bind-01.txt Pages: 19 Date: 2003-2-10 This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource.  </s>
<s> Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource.  </s>
<s> Servers are required to insure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created.  </s>

<s> To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command.  </s>
<s> To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader.  </s>
<s> Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages.  </s>
<s> Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft.  </s>

<s> The example in para 2 of section 3.2 incorrectly states: For example, if collection C1 is mapped to both /CollX and /CollY, and C1 contains a binding named "x.gif" to a resource R1, then either [/CollX, x.gif] or [/CollY, y.gif] can appear in the DAV:parent-set of R1, but not both.  </s>
