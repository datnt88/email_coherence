<s> I've attached a working draft of the XML spec DTD to this message.  </s>
<s> This  </s>
<s> isn't a "public" draft; I'd like folks to beat on it a bit and send me  </s>
<s> comments over the next week before I make it real.  </s>
<s> If I'm lucky, I will have finished the documentation by then too.  </s>
<s> I've done the following: #1997-03-10: maler #- Merged the character entity and table modules into the main file.  </s>
<s> #- Added ldquo and rdquo entities.  </s>
<s> #- Added common attributes to prodgroup.  </s>
<s> #- Made the email element in header optional.  </s>
<s> #- Removed reference to the SGML Open table model.  </s>
<s> #- Added ednote element.  </s>
<s> #- Added quote element.  </s>
<s> #- Updated XLink usage to reflect 3 March 1998 WD. #- Added "local" entities to the class entities for customization.  </s>
<s> #- Parameterized several content models to allow for customization.  </s>
<s> If you search through the file for # in the first column, you'll find all the locations where something significant changed.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Eve  </s>
<s> May I comment from the more distant perspective of someone who writes for SDO's other than the W3C?  </s>
<s> Alignment attributes.  </s>
<s> No default.  </s>
<s> -- !ENTITY % trtd.att "align (left... bgcolor CDATA #IMPLIED  </s>
<s> I raised an eyebrow when I saw this.  </s>
<s> What happened to the separation of content and style?  </s>
<s> !ELEMENT bibl (%bibl.pcd.mix;)* !-- HREF attribute: bibl optionally functions as a hypertext reference to the referred-to resource through this attribute.  </s>
<s> --  </s>
<s> Anders Berglund in his massive DTD for the ISO/IEC gave a lot of structure to the bibliography which was almost an approximate match for the well known BibTeX, whereas %bibl.pcd.mix; looks more like free flowing text at the mercy of the editor's initiative.  </s>
<s> A DTD for more general use might need more structure here.  </s>
<s> I couldnt find an element for a normative reference as opposed to an informative bibliographic reference.  </s>
<s> Normative references are very strong in the ISO/IEC.  </s>
<s> They effectively write the referenced text into the specification in a normative way.  </s>
<s> !ENTITY % pubdate.mdl  </s>
<s> "day?, month, year"  </s>
<s> Since ISO 8601 calls for the order year,month,day and since this is  </s>
<s> required by law in at least one country, perhaps it would be better to say "year,month,day?".  </s>
<s> ISO/IEC JTC1 specifications are required to have statements of their scope and field of application, their normative references, their terms and definitions and the requirements they satisfy.  </s>
<s> It would be easier to identify these components in an exchanged text if they had specific elements.  </s>
<s> An attribute could indicate that the material was not available.  </s>
<s> It would also be helpful to identify parts of a specification which are published separately, e.g. ISO/IEC 8859 Parts 1 through 10.  </s>
<s> Most SDO texts have reference numbers, and some have several.  </s>
<s> For example ISO/IEC 2022 is also ECMA-35.  </s>
<s> It would be convenient for database applications to have this information in a suitable element.  </s>
<s> SDO's such as the ITU have more than one official language, and there are National Body (NB) members of JTC1 that have more than one official language.  </s>
<s> The ITU works in French, English and Spanish.  </s>
<s> It would facilitate exchange in such cases if the DTD allowed multilingual specifications, or at least specification of which language is in use, and identification of the translations.  </s>
<s> !ELEMENT subtitle (#PCDATA) !ATTLIST subtitle %common.att;  </s>
<s> Subtitles would need language attributes for a JTC1 text.  </s>
<s> !ENTITY % header.mdl  </s>
<s> "title, subtitle?,  </s>
<s> version, w3c-designation, w3c-doctype, pubdate, notice*, publoc, prevlocs?,  </s>
<s> latestloc?, authlist, status, abstract, pubstmt?, sourcedesc?, langusage, revisiondesc"  </s>
<s> Most of this is metainformation, yet I found no reference to the Dublin Core.  </s>
<s> Was this deliberate?  </s>
<s> Roger Roger Price Dept of Computer Science, Umass Lowell rprice@cs.uml.edu  </s>
<s> Your comments are definitely welcome!  </s>
<s> Please keep in mind that this DTD was originally designed for a very small audience and purpose, so expanding it to serve as a suitable format for ISO standards would take a heck of a lot of work and change a lot of basic design assumptions.  </s>
<s> Alignment attributes.  </s>
<s> No default.  </s>
<s> -- !ENTITY % trtd.att "align (left... bgcolor CDATA #IMPLIED  </s>
<s> Hey, it's a geometric table model... :-) This was taken straight out of HTML.  </s>
<s> !ELEMENT bibl (%bibl.pcd.mix;)* !-- HREF attribute: bibl optionally functions as a hypertext reference to the referred-to resource through this attribute.  </s>
<s> --  </s>
<s> W3C doesn't seem to have stringent requirements on the format of bibliography entries, so we went extremely simple.  </s>
<s> I'd be happy to pop in a more robust model if it seems warranted.  </s>
<s> Since the DTD now has a distinction between normative and informative div1's, it may make sense to split up bibref, either by adding an attribute or by creating a parallel element.  </s>
<s> I have no preference; I used the order in which the components appear as a guide.  </s>
<s> (Previously, it was an undifferentiated field.)  </s>
<s> I suspect that these items, being specific to the nature of an ISO/IEC specification, would require a specialized header element.  </s>
<s> I've now made the content model of header parameterized, so if you really wanted to shoehorn an ISO document into this format you could do it by customizing the DTD.  </s>
<s> !ELEMENT subtitle (#PCDATA) !ATTLIST subtitle %common.att;  </s>
<s> Again, such changes would be appropriate if we expand the scope.  </s>
<s> !ENTITY % header.mdl  </s>
<s> "title, subtitle?,  </s>
<s> version, w3c-designation, w3c-doctype, pubdate, notice*, publoc, prevlocs?,  </s>
<s> latestloc?, authlist, status, abstract, pubstmt?, sourcedesc?, langusage, revisiondesc"  </s>
<s> Well, yes, in the sense that the only requirement was to capture the fields that W3C requires.  </s>
<s> We made no attempt to make the meta interoperable.  </s>
<s> Probably we should utilize RDF here eventually... Eve  </s>
