<s> Based on conversations I've had with various members of the  </s>
<s> working group, I'd like to propose that we remove external references from the current document.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, all of us who would like to see external references in WebDav believe that they are most useful if they are named and/or numbered.  </s>
<s> The current  </s>
<s> proposal, which includes external references which are neither named nor numbered, seems like an unnecessary and unsatisfactory compromise.  </s>
<s> I have a proposal for named/numbered collections which I'll post shortly, but I wouldn't want to see it slow down the current WebDav document, so I'd be happy to have it proceed separately.  </s>
<s> -- Ellis  </s>
<s> Speaking for myself only, I don't agree.  </s>
<s> I don't see the need for naming or numbering external members (as opposed to ordering *all* members, which I have argued for) and I also believe that external members are quite  </s>
<s> useful even without any naming or numbering at all.  </s>
<s> As evidence for the latter, there is a Xerox product called DocuShare which is a Web-based repository for documents.  </s>
<s> In the DocuShare model, a "collection" (they don't call them collections but that's okay) can store both external members (URLs) and internal members.  </s>
<s> There is no ordering or numbering.  </s>
<s> (Everything has a name, it's true, but DAV already provides a name in the form of the displayname property.) So I must respectfully deny your assertion.  </s>
<s> We need external members, and we don't need numbering.  </s>
<s> Removing external members would hurt, and I see nothing to gain by holding out for "numbered" external members.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.  </s>
<s> I was suggesting naming and numbering *all* members.  </s>
<s> Both ADDREF and PUT take a Position header, much like your ordering proposal.  </s>
<s> The difference is that, for numbering, the Position header can take an index as an alternative to a resource URI, which allows multiple instances of the same external resource at different places.  </s>
<s> In talking to Judith Slein at the IETF meeting, she mentioned that this was an issue for Xerox as well, since a compound document might indeed need to have references to the same external document in multiple places.  </s>
<s> There might be cases like DocuShare in which unnamed/unnumbered external members are useful, but I believe such cases represent a relatively small minority of the uses of external references in collection-like entities now and in the future.  </s>
<s> But, given that you're a true believer in unnamed/unnumbered external references, and given where we are in the evolution of the spec, I'll retract my proposal to remove external references from the spec, and instead integrate unnamed/unnumbered external references with my proposal.  </s>
<s> -- Ellis  </s>
<s> Another spam filter message.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Good.  </s>
<s> Just to add my voice here: we have a requirement for unnamed/unnumbered external references in our Smart Delivery collections as well.  </s>
<s> It is our belief that such cases represent the *majority* of the items in our collections.  </s>
