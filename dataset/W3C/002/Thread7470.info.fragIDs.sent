Based on conversations I've had with various members of the 
working group, I'd like to propose that we remove external references from the current document. 
As far as I know, all of us who would like to see external references in WebDav believe that they are most useful if they are named and/or numbered. 
The current 
proposal, which includes external references which are neither named nor numbered, seems like an unnecessary and unsatisfactory compromise. 
I have a proposal for named/numbered collections which I'll post shortly, but I wouldn't want to see it slow down the current WebDav document, so I'd be happy to have it proceed separately.

Speaking for myself only, I don't agree. 
I don't see the need for naming or numbering external members (as opposed to ordering *all* members, which I have argued for) and I also believe that external members are quite 
useful even without any naming or numbering at all. 
As evidence for the latter, there is a Xerox product called DocuShare which is a Web-based repository for documents. 
In the DocuShare model, a "collection" (they don't call them collections but that's okay) can store both external members (URLs) and internal members. 
There is no ordering or numbering. 
(Everything has a name, it's true, but DAV already provides a name in the form of the displayname property.) So I must respectfully deny your assertion. 
We need external members, and we don't need numbering. 
Removing external members would hurt, and I see nothing to gain by holding out for "numbered" external members. 
Perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. 
I was suggesting naming and numbering *all* members. 
Both ADDREF and PUT take a Position header, much like your ordering proposal. 
The difference is that, for numbering, the Position header can take an index as an alternative to a resource URI, which allows multiple instances of the same external resource at different places. 
In talking to Judith Slein at the IETF meeting, she mentioned that this was an issue for Xerox as well, since a compound document might indeed need to have references to the same external document in multiple places. 
There might be cases like DocuShare in which unnamed/unnumbered external members are useful, but I believe such cases represent a relatively small minority of the uses of external references in collection-like entities now and in the future. 
But, given that you're a true believer in unnamed/unnumbered external references, and given where we are in the evolution of the spec, I'll retract my proposal to remove external references from the spec, and instead integrate unnamed/unnumbered external references with my proposal.

Another spam filter message.

Good. 
Just to add my voice here: we have a requirement for unnamed/unnumbered external references in our Smart Delivery collections as well. 
It is our belief that such cases represent the *majority* of the items in our collections.
