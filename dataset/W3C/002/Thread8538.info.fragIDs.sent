<s> Hello, A question regarding requirements of the XML Signatures spec, specifically enveloped signatures and XPath requirement.  </s>
<s> The spec reads (chapter 10): "Signature, Enveloped  </s>
<s> The signature is over the XML content that contains the signature as an  </s>
<s> element.  </s>
<s> The content provides the root XML document element.  </s>
<s> Obviously, enveloped signatures must take care not to include their own value in the calculation of the SignatureValue."  </s>
<s> The interop requirements doc reads: "Feature: Enveloped Signature MUST requires: XPath selector that drops SignatureValue" I remember there was some talk about this at the FTF meeting in San Jose.  </s>
<s> It was discussed that it could be possible to detect this particular XPath  </s>
<s> expression without implementing the entire XPath support.  </s>
<s> Has anyone worked out a (standard?) XPath expression for excluding the  </s>
<s> Signature or SignatureValue element?  </s>

<s> At the very least, serialize() needs access to the namespace prefix.  </s>
<s> I still don't understand.  </s>
<s> In an XPath transform, the inputs are essentially  </s>
<s> a resource and an XPath expression.  </s>
<s> The resource is parsed into an XML document, the XPath context initialize, and the XPath is evaluated.  </s>
<s> Now you have an XML document and a node list (temporarily treating other return types as degenerate), which is simply a list of pointers into the XML document.  </s>
<s> Evaluation of the XPath doesn't (can't) provide any more  </s>
<s> information than is already available in the document instance.  </s>
<s> In fact the opposite may be true, since the XML document may contain more information than is exposed in the XPath data model.  </s>
<s> Also, I think that serialization is the one thing that you would not expect an XPath engine to provide (unlike parsing).  </s>
<s> I do not expect an XPath engine to provide parsing.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's doesn't, as an example.  </s>
<s> Likewise, my XML processor may indeed provide a serialization feature.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's does, for example.  </s>
<s> I'm not able to use the existing functionality that may be provided by a processor because a specific implementation strategy has been prescribed - the serialize() function.  </s>
<s> Now, I don't believe the Microsoft serializer IS quite adequate because your constraints are too severe - but that's a separate potential issue.  </s>
<s> As I indicated previously, I would not expect an XPath implementation to be optimized for returning the huge strings that could result from the  </s>
<s> serialize() function.  </s>
<s> And as I indicated previously, the necessity/danger of user intervention on the serialized string has not been justified.  </s>
<s> Even the necessity of a two-step process of serializing and then converting to UTF-8 gives me pause for thought - it looks like I might need two separate serialize() functionalities to obtain maximum performance.  </s>
<s> I still don't understand this argument either.  </s>
<s> If the serialize function  </s>
<s> can be called automatically for nodesets as you prescribe, this would seem  </s>
<s> to indicate that there is not a necessity to expose it to the user in all cases.  </s>
<s> If you are not using the prescribed XPath extension mechanism in all  </s>
<s> cases, how does this contribute to maintaining "the property that dsig is an  </s>
<s> application of XPath"?  </s>
<s> The output of the XPath processor is not the end result of the transform in all cases.  </s>
<s> Doing more or less back-end work is a pretty abstract distinction.  </s>
<s> I feel that it is already an appropriate application of XPath to locate  </s>
<s> nodes in an XML document.  </s>
<s> Going beyond this to serializing within the XPath  </s>
<s> expression itself doesn't contribute to the impression that dsig is an XPath application.  </s>
<s> In fact, my gut feeling is that it is abuse because it appears to short-circuit the primary XPath return type of nodeset.  </s>
<s> The redundancy argument still applies.  </s>
<s> I can call the serialize() function, or not, with the same result.  </s>
<s> Without some use cases justifying the need for the long form, the short form looks perfectly adquate to me.  </s>
<s> Note that there is no standard mechanism defined by XPath to "call"  </s>
<s> extension functions outside of the XPath expression.  </s>
<s> The XSLT spec  </s>
<s> carefully uses descriptions like "the resulting object is converted to a  </s>

<s> Instead the root of the input XML document is provided as the context node of the initial evaluation context.  </s>
<s> Certain assumptions about what information the parser must retain have been expressed, but all of these assumptions seem to be necessary to support other functionality of XPath.  </s>
<s> Specifically, I assume that the QName of an element, attribute or namespace node can be created using the information available in the parse tree of any processor that is bundled with an XPath engine.  </s>
<s> 2) Exact order is eliminated; lex order on input is eliminated; lex order of attribute and namespace nodes in the output has been specified in accordance with group feedback.  </s>

<s> In fact the opposite may be true, since the XML document may contain more information than is exposed in the XPath data model.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> The exact point I'm trying to make is that information needed for serialization (specifically, the namespace prefix) is not publically available.  </s>
<s> However, we can deduce from the XPath specification that the required information (e.g. namespace prefix) is available privately to the XPath evaluator.  </s>
<s> It must be available since otherwise the XPath evaluator would be unable to do anything with the initial namespace declarations created during evaluation context initialization.  </s>
<s> Since the required information is available internally, AND certain existing XPath function must be able to access that information, we can deduce that the information is available to XPath functions.  </s>
<s> Hence, since serialize() is defined as an XPath function, it must be able to access namespace prefixes and document order positions, whether or not they are in the public data model exposed to XPath expression authors.  </s>
<s> I do not expect an XPath engine to provide parsing.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's doesn't, as an example.  </s>
<s> john Microsoft has an XPath engine.  </s>
<s> Firstly, tell me where it is so I can look at it.  </s>
<s> Is it open source?  </s>
<s> Second, regardless of whether it provides a parser in the concrete sense, it must be coupled with a parser in the abstract sense.  </s>
<s> You must initialize the evaluation context, you must provide a context node, position and size, the context node, position and size together form a node-set, and the XPath evaluator must be able to derive from that node-set the namespace prefixes and the document order positions.  </s>
<s> Regardless of where you got the processor, you have had to create enough data structure SOMEHOW to support the described operations.  </s>
<s> /john Likewise, my XML processor may indeed provide a serialization feature.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's does, for example.  </s>
<s> I'm not able to use the existing functionality that may be provided by a processor because a specific implementation strategy has been prescribed - the serialize() function.  </s>
<s> Now, I don't believe the Microsoft serializer IS quite adequate because your constraints are too severe - but that's a separate potential issue.  </s>
<s> john If your serialization function were adequate, then I wonder why you can't call it from your serialize() implementation?  </s>
<s> As to its adequacy, if the tool doesn't work, then don't use it.  </s>
<s> You can only reuse code in a new application if it fits the application.  </s>
<s> However, the serialization described in the spec is QUITE easy to implement, so I cannot fathom why it would be a 'potential issue'.  </s>
<s> As I indicated previously, I would not expect an XPath implementation to be optimized for returning the huge strings that could result from the serialize() function.  </s>
<s> And as I indicated previously, the necessity/danger of user intervention on the serialized string has not been justified.  </s>
<s> Even the necessity of a two-step process of serializing and then converting to UTF-8 gives me pause for thought - it looks like I might need two separate serialize() functionalities to obtain maximum performance.  </s>
<s> The need for serialize() has been justified on several levels.  </s>
<s> Firstly, there is no security threat in allowing user intervention on the serialized node-set.  </s>
<s> For you to argue otherwise would require that you explain why it is significantly different from writing a different XPath expression.  </s>
<s> The XPath expression is signed, so its modification of the input follows a well-known behavior that we can prove is the correct behavior leading to the given message digest.  </s>
<s> Secondly, I've justified it from the specification standpoint.  </s>
<s> By defining the behavior as a function library addition to XPath, the result of the DSig WG's work can continue to be viewed as an application of XPath, not as an extension of XPath.  </s>
<s> Thirdly, I've justified it on technical grounds.  </s>
<s> There is information required for serialization that is not available in the public information but which MUST be available to the implementations of certain XPath functions.  </s>
<s> Please have another look at how XPath handles the namespace declarations in the evaluation context.  </s>
<s> If I have misread something, please let me know, but I did ask for clarification on this point, and noone (including James Clark) has refuted this point yet.  </s>
<s> As for two serializations, that's not happening.  </s>
<s> The first act is a 'serialization' of the node-set.  </s>
<s> The second action is a character transcoding to UTF-8.  </s>
<s> My original assumption was that implementations would not lose track of the input document's encoding.  </s>
<s> This was based on the fact that I specified a parse() that would do this.  </s>
<s> You specifically along with others wanted to get rid of the parse().  </s>
<s> The natural result is that I can no longer claim that the input document stays in the same encoding.  </s>
<s> Since I also lose the BOM, UTF-8 is the only viable alternative.  </s>
<s> serialize(), however, cannot output UTF-8 because it is an XPath function, which must output a string.  </s>
<s> The details of what that means are specific to the XPath implementation itself.  </s>
<s> Transcoding to UTF-8 is not an action that fits within XPath.  </s>
<s> I still don't understand this argument either.  </s>
