<s> Hello, The issue with whitespace in XML element content has been very briefly discussed during interop testing.  </s>
<s> I would like raise this issue on the list, as I believe many people expect insignificant whitespace to be cleaned up by the C14N algorithms.  </s>
<s> The current specification provides no way for an application to skip or cleanup insignificant whitespace from a signed XML document before digesting.  </s>
<s> However, 'insignificant' comment elements are skipped by the default C14N algorithm!  </s>
<s> I think we could make use of a transformation algorithm that cleans up insignificant whitespace, the algorithm should obviously detect xml:space attributes.  </s>

<s> Hello Petteri, The only insignificant whitespace is the whitespace between elements in element content.  </s>
<s> With an XPath/nodes-based approach, and assuming it is a validating processor and you have the DTD (not sure that's how it's defined at the moment), you can get rid of that.  </s>
<s> However, you cannot get rid of whitespace in element content.  </s>
<s> The XML spec only says (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-white-space):  </s>
<s> The value "default" signals that applications' default white-space processing modes are acceptable for this element; the value "preserve" indicates the intent that applications preserve all the white space.  </s>
<s> Because you don't know what the default processing of the application is, you can't get rid of the (maybe insignificant) whitespace.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hi Petteri, The upcoming C14N draft is quite a bit clearer about retention of all whitespace in character content (except \r characters that disappear due to line delimiter normalization).  </s>
<s> It is both specified in the prose and shown by example.  </s>
<s> In other words, xml:space is an attribute needed by other applications.  </s>
<s> However, I like this as a transform, though I don't know whether the chairs will approve of adding it at this time.  </s>
<s> Chairs?  </s>
<s> Seems to me that if you have a DTD, then you can decide what constitutes insignificant whitespace, which is whitespace found in content models other than mixed those containing #PCData.  </s>
<s> This could get tricky in the second case, since it's not the whole content model containing a #PCDATA, but just the parts where #PCDATA is allowed.  </s>
<s> However, we cannot count on having the DTD nor on being able to read it at that level if it were.  </s>
<s> Instead, it might make sense to define the transform in terms of the XPath data model.  </s>
<s> Any text node containing only whitespace could be consider insignificant.  </s>
<s> This rule could be constrained by xml:space="preserve" provided the attribute is in the node-set and contained in an element ancestor of a 'whitespace' text node.  </s>

<s> Hi all, The Xpath function normalize-space() seems to provide a fair bit of the functionality needed to deal with this problem.  </s>
<s> If desired, space normalization could be another boolean flag for C14N (like comment vs. no comment).  </s>
<s> We would probably want both as parameters (currently, 'with comments' is triggered by a separate URI, but we'd want to account for all combinations without an explosion of URIs).  </s>
<s> The change would be that, when rendering a text node, render normalize-space(string(textnode)) if the normalize space flag is true.  </s>
<s> It's a little trickier though because we'd have to keep track of whether we are rendering the content of an element for which xml:space="preserve" exists and is in the output node-set.  </s>
<s> Question: Do we want C14N to specify this additional functionality, and if so should it be RECOMMENDED or REQUIRED to implement?  </s>
<s> Note that the following simple XPath transform can do most of the work (use currently posted new processing model): This expression eliminates all text nodes that contain only whitespace.  </s>
<s> This gets rid of whitespace between one start tag and the next, one end tag and the next and between start and end tags-- unless intervening character data appears in the text.  </s>
<s> Although the function normalizes spaces within such character data, there is no way to change the string as it appears in the node-set/parse tree.  </s>
<s> The only way to turf that kind of whitespace is to modify C14N.  </s>
<s> Any votes in favour?  </s>
<s> Chairs?  </s>
