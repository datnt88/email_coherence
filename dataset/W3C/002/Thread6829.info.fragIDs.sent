<s> I've upgraded the XMLspec DTD to Version 2.1.  </s>
<s> You can find it here:  </s>
<s> Changes since V2.0 are all backwards compatible.  </s>
<s> The changes that will be of most interest to spec authors are as follows (see the DTD or documentation for an exhaustive list): - Added the proto element for function prototypes a la XPath.  </s>
<s> - Added the phrase-level elements function, var, sub, sup, phrase, el, att, and attval.  </s>
<s> - Allowed status and abstract to appear in the W3C-dictated order.  </s>
<s> - Updated XLink usage somewhat.  </s>
<s> - Added a common diff attribute.  </s>
<s> - Added a div5 element.  </s>
<s> - Expanded the issue markup to handle issues lists better.  </s>
<s> - Added an example element.  </s>
<s> Though the documentation is accurate with respect to V2.1, it's getting long in the tooth; when I do V3.0 I'll try to overhaul it and add lots of examples.  </s>
<s> I do plan a V3.0 that will have some backwards-incompatible changes; I will distribute it with an XSLT stylesheet to upgrade legacy documents.  </s>
<s> Ben Trafford and Chris Maden are working on a canonical XSLT stylesheet for converting XMLspec documents to HTML; it will cover all markup and will use approved W3C style.  </s>
<s> It will be announced here when it becomes available.  </s>
<s> If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to let me know.  </s>

<s> Thanks, we'll try and bring the mathml spec into line...  </s>
<s> Do you have copies of the current MathML spec stylesheets?  </s>
<s> They are available (W3C access) at but I could send copies to anyone without access if that is a problem.  </s>
<s> Hopefully we could rebuild our HTML one as an extension importing any `canonical' HTML sheet.  </s>
<s> Currently it is a much modified sheet based originally on Eduardo Gutentag's xmlspec.xsl.  </s>
<s> Also there is an XSL sheet going to latex that is used for the two pdf versions of the mathml spec but would probably work for any other xmlspec based document.  </s>
<s> If I thought anyone would use it we could redo this as a `canonical' sheet for xmlspec which is imported by a mathml specific stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Also at the above URL is a stylesheet that converts an XSL stylesheet that writes HTML to one that writes XHTML (taking care of compatibility issues like avoiding hr/ ) This is used for the XHTML version of the mathml spec.  </s>
<s> David  </s>
<s> I've copied Ben and Chris; hopefully they can steal some stuff from your stylesheet wholesale.  </s>
<s> I think it would be cool to offer this output option.  </s>
<s> (The original XML spec was made available in a bunch of page-oriented forms, but since then few specs have done it.)  </s>
<s> Cute! I will add a mention of your stylesheets to the next rev of the documentation.  </s>
