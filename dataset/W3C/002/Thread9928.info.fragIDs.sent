I have sent, at last, the datatypes message to rdf interest and rdf logic and await the explosion. 
I have modified it from the draft approved by the WG in the light of recent discussion. 
I trust the WG will approve of the modification. 
At the f2f and elsewhere, concern has been raised the we might simply repeat the discussion, in all its confusion and volume, that we have had in RDFCore, in a wider forum. 
It would be a disaster if that were to happen. 
I am not sure what other WG's have done in the past, and would welcome guidance from those who have been here before. 
However, I strongly suggest that members of the WG refrain from any form of advocacy for their preferred position on the other lists. 
We are seeking input from the community on this issue, not a debate. 
I recognise that what is advocacy and what is helpful explanation is a difficult line to draw. 
I am loathe to suggest gagging people, but I also suggest that folks leave it to me to answer for the WG on any questions or issues that arise on the other lists. 
If anyone is dissatisfied with anything I say, then raise that with me first and we will correct it.

I'm happy with that. 
I would further recommend that replies from the WG include a very strong aversion to address questions about "Why not option X" and simply focus on answering questions that enable folks to decide between A and D and take the replies as they come. 
I.e., those replies that attempt to debate issues other than the explicit choice between A or D are simply ignored -- in the interest of avoiding long discussion threads -- and folks should be made aware that if they can't choose between A or D, then their input in this matter is out of scope, for the time being. 
Of course, folks will be able to raise other issues about datatyping once the first WD is published. 
Cheers, Patrick 
I have some sympathy with Peter's position, and I am sorry that Brian did not give us a chance to comment on his text before sending it. 
In particular I think the fact that: Test A*: 
Jenny ageInYears "10" . 
John ageInYears "10" . 
ageInYears rdfs:range xsd:decimal . 
holds in all cases is relevant and was omitted.

Well, I'm sure it's been very challenging for Brian to get anything written down that this cantakerous group would fully agree on ;-) Still, I think we can simply take whatever feedback we get, avoid any lengthy discussion beyond helping folks choose between A and D, and make our own determination within the WG. 
So to that end, the inquiry should produce valuable feedback (and also will alert us to key issues that must be addressed better in the WD). 
Cheers, Patrick 
I've been feeling the time pressure. 
Hmm, These test cases only relates to the situation where there are no range constraints on the properties. 
wasn't enough. 
I'm happy to send an amendment, but I'm worried about the form you suggest, as in the tidy case its a contradiction. 
I think we need to use drange, which could open another can of worms. 
I could send: 
These test cases only relates to the situation where there are no range constraints on the properties. 
I perhaps did not emphasize this point enough. 
Where the appropriate range constraints are present, all solutions produce the "expected" answer, e.g. 
an RDF processor could conclude that Jenny and John have the same age. 
Note however, that there may be issues handling very general properties, such as the container membership properties and rdf:object where it isn't really feasible to use a range contraint.
