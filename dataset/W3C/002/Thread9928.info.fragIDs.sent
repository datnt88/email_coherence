<s> I have sent, at last, the datatypes message to rdf interest and rdf logic and await the explosion.  </s>
<s> I have modified it from the draft approved by the WG in the light of recent discussion.  </s>
<s> I trust the WG will approve of the modification.  </s>
<s> At the f2f and elsewhere, concern has been raised the we might simply repeat the discussion, in all its confusion and volume, that we have had in RDFCore, in a wider forum.  </s>
<s> It would be a disaster if that were to happen.  </s>
<s> I am not sure what other WG's have done in the past, and would welcome guidance from those who have been here before.  </s>
<s> However, I strongly suggest that members of the WG refrain from any form of advocacy for their preferred position on the other lists.  </s>
<s> We are seeking input from the community on this issue, not a debate.  </s>
<s> I recognise that what is advocacy and what is helpful explanation is a difficult line to draw.  </s>
<s> I am loathe to suggest gagging people, but I also suggest that folks leave it to me to answer for the WG on any questions or issues that arise on the other lists.  </s>
<s> If anyone is dissatisfied with anything I say, then raise that with me first and we will correct it.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I'm happy with that.  </s>
<s> I would further recommend that replies from the WG include a very strong aversion to address questions about "Why not option X" and simply focus on answering questions that enable folks to decide between A and D and take the replies as they come.  </s>
<s> I.e., those replies that attempt to debate issues other than the explicit choice between A or D are simply ignored -- in the interest of avoiding long discussion threads -- and folks should be made aware that if they can't choose between A or D, then their input in this matter is out of scope, for the time being.  </s>
<s> Of course, folks will be able to raise other issues about datatyping once the first WD is published.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> I have some sympathy with Peter's position, and I am sorry that Brian did not give us a chance to comment on his text before sending it.  </s>
<s> In particular I think the fact that: Test A*:  </s>
<s> Jenny ageInYears "10" .  </s>
<s> John ageInYears "10" .  </s>
<s> ageInYears rdfs:range xsd:decimal .  </s>
<s> holds in all cases is relevant and was omitted.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Well, I'm sure it's been very challenging for Brian to get anything written down that this cantakerous group would fully agree on ;-) Still, I think we can simply take whatever feedback we get, avoid any lengthy discussion beyond helping folks choose between A and D, and make our own determination within the WG.  </s>
<s> So to that end, the inquiry should produce valuable feedback (and also will alert us to key issues that must be addressed better in the WD).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> I've been feeling the time pressure.  </s>
<s> Hmm, These test cases only relates to the situation where there are no range constraints on the properties.  </s>
<s> wasn't enough.  </s>
<s> I'm happy to send an amendment, but I'm worried about the form you suggest, as in the tidy case its a contradiction.  </s>
<s> I think we need to use drange, which could open another can of worms.  </s>
<s> I could send:  </s>

<s> I perhaps did not emphasize this point enough.  </s>
<s> Where the appropriate range constraints are present, all solutions produce the "expected" answer, e.g.  </s>
<s> an RDF processor could conclude that Jenny and John have the same age.  </s>
<s> Note however, that there may be issues handling very general properties, such as the container membership properties and rdf:object where it isn't really feasible to use a range contraint.  </s>
