After all this discussion I still ask: Is it legal to write file uri like the following file:/e:/xxx.pdf or should it be file:/e%3a/xxx.pdf 
or both are valid ?

Officially, there has been no update to the "file" URI specification since RFC 1738. 
(While some of the URI schemes defined in RFC 1738 have been updated, many of them have not; that's why RFC 1738 isn't "obsoleted" yet.) In RFC 1738's definition of "file:" URIs, there _must_ be a host field, although the host can be omitted. 
So, if you're asking is it 'legal' to write 'file:/e:/xxx.pdf', the answer is no, not according to RFC 1738, you must write file:///e:/xxx.pdf 
which is valid. 
The lack of updates to bring the RFC 1738 definitions more in keeping with the actual implementations (including platform dependent specifications for how to handle drive letters and UNC paths) is really a shame. 
I'll add this to the agenda for the upcoming URI BOF at the next IETF meeting.

From RFC 2396 I understood it replaces RFC 1738. 
"This document defines the generic syntax of URI, including both absolute and relative forms, and guidelines for their use; it revises and replaces the generic definitions in RFC 1738 and RFC 1808. 
" And in RFC 2396 ' file:/e:/xxx.pdf' 
file:/e:/xxx. 
file:/e:/xxx.pdf' 
pdf' seems to be legal as an absolute URI. 

absoluteURI = scheme ":" ( hier_part | opaque_part ) hier_part = ( net_path | abs_path ) [ "?" query ] net_path = "//" authority [ abs_path ] abs_path = "/" path_segments    --- so file:/e:/ file:/e file:/e:/ :/... is acceptable. 1) Which RFC should I follow in case of file URIs 2396 or 1738 ? 
2) About the escaping of ':' seperator of the drive letter. 
is " file:///e%3a/xxx.pdf 
file:///e%3a/xxx. 
file:///e%3a/xxx.pdf 
pdf" also valid ?
