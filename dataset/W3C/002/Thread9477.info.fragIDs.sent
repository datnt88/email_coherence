<s> In the resolution of issues the WG decided to allow rdf:li elements as typed nodes.  </s>
<s> This was at the time an arbritary decision, made primarily to ensure that there was a definite answer.  </s>
<s> There has been implementor feedback that this was not a good decision.  </s>
<s> The WG will also be considering by Friday issue: where it is proposed to disallow names from the RDF namespace in inappropriate contexts, e.g. rdf:Description not be allowed on a property element.  </s>
<s> I propose o Use of rdf:li is an error o be deleted o that the test cases for rdfms-rdf-names-use should illustrate this error.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Yes, I agree.  </s>
<s> This is a rather bizarre case.  </s>
<s> (Would it be easiest on implementers to say that the effect of using rdf:li as a typednode is undefined?)  </s>

<s> Graham Klyne said:  </s>
<s> Since we previously said in earlier test cases that it was allowed, I prefer to make the existing test case an error.rdf  </s>
<s> rather than delete it from the list of approved tests.  </s>
<s> This change shouldn't break earlier code since rdf:li as an element name was not explicitly in the old grammar (except by matching the old typedNode) and the feedback from the probably, only, implementors who looked at the change is the reason we are junking it!  </s>
