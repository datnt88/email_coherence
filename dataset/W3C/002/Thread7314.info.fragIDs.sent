<s> I agree that WEBDAV shouldn't become involved in specifying implementations, but I do think it is not only appropriate but necessary for us to specify requirements for access control.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the term ACL conjures up images Windows NT, OpenVMS and some flavors of UNIX.  </s>
<s> As such, it does sound like an implementation approach, but I think access control is a design issue and not an implementation issue.  </s>
<s> Or am I missing the point?  </s>

<s> I think it's the List part of ACL (Access Control List) that gets into implementation.  </s>
<s> If I understand, everyone wants access control specified, but doesn't want to restrict how it's done to lists,at least in the design.  </s>
<s> Directory based, role based, ... , don't have a list per se.  </s>

<s> By all means it makes sense to manage the "lists" through a directory service.  </s>

<s> How can an interoperable client deal with an access control policy if it doesn't have an implementation that fits the structure?  </s>
<s> I think the answer is "policy is embedded in forms".  </s>
<s> The "access control policy" for a resource is linked metadata, but there is also a method for associating an access control policy with a realm.  </s>
<s> We need to define the realm, too.  </s>
