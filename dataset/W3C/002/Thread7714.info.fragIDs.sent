<s> Joe,  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that methods only return a multistatus when they effect multiple resources.  </s>
<s> So for example, you could DELETE a collection  </s>
<s> and get a multistatus if it failed indicating which resource in the collection couldn't be deleted.  </s>
<s> If the DELETE failed because the collection itself was locked, then you could also return a single status as the  </s>
<s> members were unaffected.  </s>
<s> Similarly, if the method succeeded, you would just  </s>
<s> get a 200 status code for the whole operation.  </s>

<s> PROPPATCH uses 207 responses for methods on single resources, I think?  </s>
<s> Yes, so if it failed, why not return a 4xx class response which is what 4xx class responses are for?  </s>
<s> The 'degree' to which it failed (i.e., which resources couldn't be deleted) is indicated only by the response body, but the bottom line is that the request did NOT succeed, which is what 2xx responses are for.  </s>
<s> I'm not trying to suggest that multistatus responses should be scrapped, only that they should not have a fixed status code.  </s>
