<s> Hello Joseph, I think there are still two errors in the SignatureProperties section (5.29 of the current editor copy of the XML-Signature working draft:  </s>
<s> element name='SignatureProperty' complexType content='mixed' any namespace='##other' processContents='lax' minOccurs='1'  </s>
<s> maxOccurs='unbounded'/  </s>
<s> attribute name='Target' type='uriReference' use='required'/ attribute name='Id' type='ID' use='optional'/ /complexType /element  </s>
<s> 1. Since the content model is mixed, also a SignatureProperty Element with no subelements, but only textual content should be allowed.  </s>
<s> Therefore the minOccurs attribute should have a correct value of '0'  </s>
<s> !ELEMENT SignatureProperty %Object.ANY; !ATTLIST SignatureProperty Target CDATA #REQUIRED Id ID #IMPLIED !ENTITY % Object.ANY  </s>
<s> '(#PCDATA|Signature|SignatureProperties|Manifest)*' 2. The content model for SignatureProperty according to the DTD definition allows also things like Signature and SignatureProperties, which are in the namespace of XML-Signature.  </s>
<s> This is in contradiction with the declartion of namespace='##other' in the schema above.  </s>
<s> Regards, Gregor Gregor Karlinger Phone +43 316 873 5541 Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications Austria  </s>
<s> Ok. Fixed.  </s>
<s> !ELEMENT SignatureProperty %Object.ANY; !ATTLIST SignatureProperty Target CDATA #REQUIRED Id ID #IMPLIED !ENTITY % Object.ANY  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> This isn't really a mistake as much as a best effort since the DTD is limited (and I didn't want to create too many entities) and the schema permits specificity and I know it wouldn't make sense just to throw a naked signature in SignatureProperties... I could create a SignatureProperties.ANY that was #PCDATA only, I could make the schema definition ##any, or leave it as is.  </s>
<s> What's your preference?  </s>

<s> The schema declaration is fine.  </s>
<s> It expresses what we want, namely that anything is allowed except structures from the dsig namespace.  </s>
<s> None of the possible solutions for the DTD corresponds with this intention; I think the less ill one would be to declare SignatureProperty #PCDATA only,  </s>
<s> since it does not contradict the schema definition so obvious as the current content model ;-)  </s>
