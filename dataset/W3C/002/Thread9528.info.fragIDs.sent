<s> Dave  </s>
<s> OK, fair enough (though it really is mostly a syntax issue, in fact).  </s>
<s> Let me try to summarize.  </s>
<s> First, there are two separate issues/proposals which can be discussed  </s>
<s> separately, though they do fall naturally together:  </s>
<s> 1. Provide a way to allow two different occurrences of the same literal to be distinguished in the syntax.  </s>
<s> (must-do)  </s>
<s> 2. Allow literals as subjects.  </s>
<s> (optional)  </s>
<s> Let me focus on the first as it is the most important.  </s>
<s> In the current draft of the MT document, RDF graphs are required to  </s>
<s> be 'tidy', which is defined to mean that labels uniquely identify  </s>
<s> their node, ie no two nodes have the same label.  </s>
<s> "Label" here refers to both urirefs and literals; that means that, with this definition, any literal can occur in a graph only in one place, labelling one single node.  </s>
<s> This is not acceptable if we are ever going to allow nontrivial datatyping, since (if we do) that would mean that we will want one occurrence of a literal to mean one thing, and a different occurrence to mean something else, so we cannot require that they be the same occurrence in the graph.  </s>
<s> (Exactly how the different occurrences of, say, "010701" are inferred to be of type integer, or string, or date, or whatever, is another issue that we can discuss separately; the present point is only that different occurrences of the same literal might be somehow treated differently, so cannot be forced to be syntactically identical.)  </s>
<s> So, if we have (or even contemplate the possibility of some extension of RDF ever having) nontrivial literal datatyping, then we have to relax the strict tidiness condition on literals, and allow the same literal label to appear at several places in the graph.  </s>
<s> So far, no problem.  </s>
<s> The problem arises in describing these graphs in N-literals syntax.  </s>
<s> In brief, you can't.  </s>
<s> That is, there is no way to tell, given an Ntriples document, which of several alternative RDF graphs it might be supposed to indicate, since if the same literal occurs in several different triples, you might or might not make them them be the same node, and there's nothing in the Ntripledoc that tells you which is intended.  </s>
<s> And moreover, it matters, since the different graphs will have different meanings in the model theory (if it is extended to allow complex datatyping.)  </s>
<s> So we need a way to indicate, in an Ntriples document, which of the various occurrences of a literal are supposed to go onto the same node in the graph, and which are not.  </s>
<s> The proposed 'Ntriples++' extension is one way to do that, which uses the same node-indicating scheme as Ntriples already uses for blank nodes, but lets it be applied to literals as well (optionally).  </s>
<s> This wasn't a problem, to emphasize, when literals are not typed (or if they all have the same type, eg string) since then we can safely impose tidiness on literals as well as on urirefs.  </s>
<s> But I really do think that it would be a mistake to take this (slightly) easier way out, since the resulting language will not *permit* complex datatyping, even in any extension built on top of it.  </s>
<s> This would for example cause DAML+OIL to no longer be RDF-compatible.  </s>
<s> OK, that's the pressing matter.  </s>
<s> The other matter is less pressing.  </s>
<s> If we were to allow literals as subjects, then this proposed extension to the Ntriples syntax could also be used to specify graphs in which datatyping information was specified directly, by simply asserting that a (particular occurrence of a) literal has a datatype as its rdf:type.  </s>
<s> (see  </s>
<s> ) This would provide a simple, obvious mechanism for declaring datatypes which would integrate smoothly into both the (extended) RDF syntax, and also the proposed model-theory treatment of datatypes.  </s>
<s> (sketched in And I can see no rational reason to prohibit it, other than it possibly being beyond our charter.  </s>
<s> So this seems to me to be some extra support for the proposal to allow literals as subjects.  </s>
<s> (However, even if this proposal is rejected, the previous point stands on its own.  </s>
<s> ) I hope this covers the issues adequately.  </s>

<s> No; because we can consider the typed datum to be the literal, not its (unicode) representation.  </s>
<s> These are all distinct wherever we need them  </s>
<s> to be, and the "same" for the purposes of tidyness where we need them to  </s>
<s> be.  </s>
<s> If you do this the problem you describe goes away (I think).  </s>
<s> This is an interesting point.  </s>
<s> What I'm suggesting is that there is an "inherent type" associated with a literal.  </s>
<s> This is distinct from any assertions made in a graph.  </s>
<s> We can go one step beyond a model theory by  </s>
<s> talking about categorising which interpretations we consider to be  </s>
<s> valid; for instance, we might require that integer(23) rdf:type xsd:Integer .  </s>
<s> should be ok in all valid interpretations, but integer(23) rdf:type foo:NegativeInteger .  </s>
<s> should not be.  </s>
<s> This becomes less of a problem if you adopt the notion of multiple "literal instances" as was recently suggested.  </s>

<s> Pat Hayes said:  </s>
<s> If this is a requirement of the MT, do you require RDF/XML 1.0 to generate such models?  </s>
<s> i.e. should rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:ex="http://example.org/properties/" generate http://example.org/  </s>

<s> "blah" .  </s>
<s> http://example.org/ http://example.org/properties/bar  </s>
<s> "blah" .  </s>
<s> I'm assuming this is optional but recommended?  </s>
<s> And RDF/XML 1.0 continues to be unable to generate such models; which  </s>
<s> we can record in the syntax doc if/when we make this decision.  </s>
<s> Thanks; that was the explanation I was looking for.  </s>
<s> Should get people thinking :) I suggest these two things, especially #1, are substantial and need discussion and WG consensus.  </s>
<s> This could wait till the next version of the MT working draft is ready for us to review.  </s>
<s> Which is real soon, yeah?  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Ok, what IS a literal, exactly?  </s>
<s> Please write a few of them down so I can see them, if you would be so kind....  </s>
<s> They have to be things that we can include in Ntriples documents and use as graph labels.  </s>
<s> If you mean that the literal IS something like an externally tagged label, where the tagging is included as part of the literal, then that is what I originally had in mind when writing the MT, but that has been strongly rejected by others.  </s>
<s> So what exactly is the label in the graph?  </s>
<s> You seem to be saying that the problem just goes away by magic if we say that two things are the same and also not the same.  </s>
<s> I think that is the solution I originally had in mind.  </s>
<s> However it does not seem to be acceptable to most people, in particular to the DAML folk, and it doesn't seem to match up with the general usage of 'literal'.  </s>
<s> Also it is still a hedge around the basic problem, which is that insisting on uniqueness of literals is a lot less reasonable than for urirefs, and is liable to lock us into a box we would rather not be in, and there is no real RDF reason why we need to.  </s>
<s> We invented Ntriples ourselves, right, so we can re-invent it just as easily.  </s>
<s> The type has to be associated with a particular *occurrence* of a literal, and the only thing we have in the graph syntax to distinguish one of these from another is the node it is attached to.  </s>
<s> If there is going to be *any* kind of way to indicating the datatype of a literal by some means in the graph, then we cannot have the literal typing done by the literal label itself.  </s>
<s> In any case, putting datatype information into the label is just as much an extension to the current language; and this generalization would not rule it out; so this keeps our options open.  </s>
<s> This IS model theory; you are stating semantic conditions on an interpretation.  </s>
<s> But look: what is integer(23) here?  </s>
<s> A literal?  </s>
<s> If you can tell that its an integer by looking at it, what do you need that triple for?  </s>
<s> And if that triple is true, does _:xxx rdf:type xsd:Integer .  </s>
<s> have to be entailed by it?  </s>
<s> If its not a literal, what is it?  </s>
<s> Maybe I missed that.  </s>
<s> Pointer?  </s>
