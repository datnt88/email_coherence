<s> No, there is much more at stake here.  </s>
<s> We are talking about developing the protocol for managing documents on the Web.  </s>
<s> This involves access to a variety of sources, only one of which is the traditional file system.  </s>
<s> Of further interest is access authentication (notice I did NOT say ACL) and document privacy (although this is a very sticky problem, see my comments earlier today on the list server).  </s>
<s> "Generation X" is going to require the secure and authenticated sharing of documents to move various projects ahead.  </s>
<s> Traditional document management system (DMS) functions like check-in, check-out, document control, version control, etc. must be supported as well as the simple file system access.  </s>

<s> After reading Jim Whitehead's "Requirements on HTTP for Dist.  </s>
<s> Editing", I found myself asking the question, "To a first approximation, aren't we just reinventing a file system protocol (e.g. NFS, Andrew, etc.)?" Did I miss something important?  </s>

<s> I've been thinking about the exchange we've had about "distributed editing vs reinventing file system protocol", and trying to extract from it: * Which requirements for distributed editing can NOT be met by a file system protocol?  </s>
<s> * Are those requirements explicitly described in the "Requirements on HTTP for Distributed Editing" (an unfortunate title).  </s>
<s> I think that most of the requirements are 'information hiding' rather than 'capabilities' requirements (e.g., "clients need not be aware of server's locking scheme in order to add a new version" is an information hiding requirement.) Larry  </s>
<s> My comments below: -src  </s>
<s> I think that most (if not all) file systems will have a problem with a presistant lock and in maintaining the ownership of that lock.  </s>
<s> Generally, if a file system is advised that a file is to be locked to prevent writing by anyone other that the lock holder, that lock is only honored until the file system is restarted.  </s>
<s> This is reasonable because the assumption is that the process editing the document will have gone through the same state change as the file system and will therefore know that the lock must be re-aquired.  </s>
<s> This will not be the case with distributed authoring.  </s>
<s> The file system state will be a non-issue as far as the authoring process is concerned.  </s>
<s> For these and the other reasons I've stated, the working group is working toward augmenting existing protocols to allow persistant-state (lock being one of the states) processing of documents in a global context.  </s>
<s> The intent is that the requirements be explicit.  </s>
<s> We spent several hours on the requirements during our last meeting.  </s>
<s> Jim will soon publish the result and I anticipate more discussion.  </s>
<s> This will be a great opportunity for you to see where we are.  </s>
<s> Information hiding is only one of the aspects of the requirements.  </s>
<s> State hiding is another.  </s>
<s> Persistance yet another.  </s>
<s> This is far from a simple case.  </s>

<s> All: (I was out most of last week, so this my first real opportunity to respond.)  </s>
<s> The only issue I want to raise is the following -- must the distributed authoring be done with a single protocol or can a collection of protocols be employed to accomplish the task?  </s>
<s> Is it an absolutely necessary to support traditional document management systems?  </s>
<s> If there is a solution that solves all of the problems being addressed by a traditional DMS and does more, couldn't we skip the traditional DMS solution?  </s>
<s> This is not idle speculation on my part.  </s>
<s> In my day-to-day activities, I use a distributed document management system that has local file locks, but no global (remote) locks.  </s>
<s> (Actually, there is one global lock, but it could easily be removed.) -Wayne  </s>
