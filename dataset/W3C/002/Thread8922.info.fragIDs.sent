Hi guys, I had a quick question regarding Canonical XML and instances of XML Schemas. 
Section 2.1 of the Canonical XML standard specifies what the canonical output for attributes should be. 
"the attribute value normalization and entity reference resolution MUST be performed in accordance with the behaviors of a validating XML processor" Is there any guidelines on how to handle data of a content model in the instance of an XML Schema ? 
Example, if we have the following XML Schema and my instance looks like should the Canonical form of this instance be A) price 12.00 /price B) price 12.00 /price Notice that the white space has been stripped out from (B), whereas it is being retained in (A). 
Any comments would be greatly appreciated. 
Regards Don 
Hi Don, By validating XML parser, we mean validation as described in the XML recommendation, not XML schema validation. 
So A) would be rendered. 
This is not to say that future canonicalization algorithms will not be defined to rely on such things as schema validation. 
A good first, though, would be an XPath reliant on the latest infoset (but that's beside the point of your interest).

John, A followup question. 
If the XSDL instance document has default attributes, are they supposed to be added to the canonical form? 
So, continuing Don's example, let's say Price has a default attribute defined, "maximum", with a value of "500". 
However, the source instance doesn't contain the "maximum" attribute. 
Does the "maximum" attribute show up in the canonical form?
