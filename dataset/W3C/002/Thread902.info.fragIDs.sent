<s> OK, i have now managed to resolve my problems with the batch files and have started processing my documents.  </s>
<s> The latest problem I have now is that Tidy keeps on hanging on a particular document.  </s>
<s> The only obvious problem I can see is that there are 4 /font tags in a row a few lines after the last warning.  </s>
<s> I have tried running the page through TidyUI, but that fails.  </s>
