<s> I've got a problem with table data.  </s>
<s> When I use tidy with these options  tidy -asxml -m filename.htm  </s>
<s> each table data is converted in this way: original td, in a single line  </s>
<s> after using tidy, in two lines height="1" border="0" /td How could I avoid this inconvenience?  </s>

<s> Have you tried "wrap: 0" in the config?  </s>
<s> I edit at tiny point sizes cause I like long lines so I never wany an arbitrary wrap point.  </s>
<s> I never get this behavior with my config.  </s>
<s> Though, that does remind me.  </s>
<s> It does still insert a blank line between lines of TD foo /TD which is terribly annoying.  </s>
<s> Anyone know how to fix that?  </s>
<s> or does it do that by nature.  </s>
<s> When I get a chance I'll see if I can actually get around to making a couple patches.  </s>
<s> As of R6, I notice that the tag: input type=string name=something value= is now treated as though it said: input type=string name=something value="value" which seems odd, to say the least.  </s>
<s> Is this related to the "bug-fix" described as "Fixed a bug where createElement() was not properly setting Node.tag if the tag to be added could not be found in the the TagTable.  </s>
<s> A generic entry is now used instead of leaving the entry set to null."?  </s>
<s> I would have thought that treating it as an empty string input type=string name=something value="" would have been a safer choice.  </s>
<s> This should not have changed from that bug fix since "input" should have been found in TagTable all along.  </s>
<s> Can you provide the actual HTML page along with your configuration file or command line options and I'll try to reproduce the problem.  </s>

<s> I think Russell must be using -asxml.  </s>
<s> I've reproduced this in both JTidy and the official 4-Aug-2000 Tidy.  </s>
<s> Problems occur with both input and option elements.  </s>
<s> Here's the test file: Hitting the submit button in a browser produces the following URLs: IE 5.5: http://www.w3.org/?option=option+1&amp;input=&amp;submit=submit  </s>
<s> Netscape 4.7: http://www.w3.org/?option=&amp;input=&amp;submit=submit  </s>
<s> (these are the only browsers I have ready access to) Tidy changes both of the valueless value attributes as follows: default options: value="" -asxml: value="value" So with default options, Tidy appears to be correct (for option value , Tidy has chosen to simulate Netscape's behavior).  </s>
<s> However, with -asxml, Tidy appears to be plain wrong.  </s>
<s> One possible fix is to modify parseAttrs() in lexer.c to detect if the attribute name is "value" and it has no value and its owning element is either "option" or "input" (the owning element name would have to be passed in as an additional argument).  </s>
<s> When this condition occurs, Tidy should set the value to "" or simply discard the attribute altogether.  </s>
<s> I've taken the "discard" approach and applied it to our local copy of JTidy, and it seems to work.  </s>
