<s> FYI, Marimba, Netscape, Sun, Novell, and At Home have submitted a NOTE to the W3C for discussion titled the "The HTTP Distribution and Replication Protocol."  </s>
<s> This proposal can be found at: Further discussion of DRP can be found at Marimba's DRP page: Also submitted was the "Generic Diff Format Specification," a binary diff transfer format, available at: This proposal overlaps the current and intended functionality of WebDAV in the following ways: 1. DRP and WebDAV both have mechanisms for retrieving a listing of a collection of resources.  </s>
<s> However, while WebDAV only returns a single hierarchy level at a time, DRP has a requirement that a listing of a consistent configuration of resources be retrievable, and this implies encoding multiple hierarchy levels.  </s>
<s> DRP stores directory information in a single resource, while WebDAV employs an INDEX method.  </s>
<s> 2. DRP provides a mechanism for identifying a particular version of a resource using a content identifier URI which is intended to encode an MD5 hash (or other guid) which identifies the particular version.  </s>
<s> This differs from the WebDAV model where each version is an individual resource, with its own URL. 3. DRP provides a mechanism for retrieving a difference between two versions of a resource by providing the identifiers for two different versions of the resource.  </s>
<s> This differs from the intent of WebDAV to define a DIFF method which would perform a difference between two resources.  </s>
<s> The DRP proposal was discussed at the W3C Push Workshop held this past Monday and Tuesday.  </s>
<s> At present, discussions are being held to determine the best forum for work on DRP.  </s>
<s> Due to the overlap in functionality, this working group was one (of many) suggestions for where DRP work should take place.  </s>
<s> Other options discussed were a W3C working group, or its own IETF working group.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> It's important that "distribution and replication" and "authoring" have the same model of "versions", since, well, how are users going to author the material that is to be distributed and replicated?  </s>
<s> This is a matter of either getting DRP to adopt WEBDAV's versioning model or vice versa.  </s>
<s> The sooner the better.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> I agree with this, particularly since DRP seems to deal with the notion of configurations and deltas which is close to our hearts.  </s>
