<s> Performance: C14n:53037 [ms] Exclusive C14n:72584 [ms] Xerces2 serializer:13219 [ms] These are time for serializing a DOM tree representing a small document 10000 times.  </s>

<s> in The test program loaded the document once and executed (exc-)c14n 10000 times on PIII-900 + Linux 2.4.18 (the time for loading and parsing document is *NOT* included) with following results: C14n: 4550 [ms] Exclusive C14n: 4500 [ms] There were no visible difference in doing c14n with or without comments.  </s>

<s> Joseph, please remove question marks for libxml on iterop report (http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/02/01-exc-c14n-interop.html) since it does support "#default" prefix and the performance does exceed c14n performance.  </s>

<s> Ok, please let me know if optimization increases the performance.  </s>
<s> My goal is that the performance should be no worse than c14n in general, and with optimization in some scenarios, faster.  </s>
<s> So I hope the 27% decrease can be mitigated in the general case.  </s>
