<s> Hello, A question regarding requirements of the XML Signatures spec, specifically enveloped signatures and XPath requirement.  </s>
<s> The spec reads (chapter 10): "Signature, Enveloped The signature is over the XML content that contains the signature as an element.  </s>
<s> The content provides the root XML document element.  </s>
<s> Obviously, enveloped signatures must take care not to include their own value in the calculation of the SignatureValue."  </s>
<s> The interop requirements doc reads: "Feature: Enveloped Signature MUST requires: XPath selector that drops SignatureValue" I remember there was some talk about this at the FTF meeting in San Jose.  </s>
<s> It was discussed that it could be possible to detect this particular XPath  </s>
<s> expression without implementing the entire XPath support.  </s>
<s> Has anyone worked out a (standard?) XPath expression for excluding the  </s>
<s> Signature or SignatureValue element?  </s>

<s> From: John Boyer [mailto:jboyer@PureEdge.com] john Right.  </s>
<s> The exact point I'm trying to make is that information needed for serialization (specifically, the namespace prefix) is not publically available.  </s>
<s> Yes it is.  </s>
<s> It's in the original document as attributes or namespace information items, and is exposed through the XPath data model as namespace nodes.  </s>
<s> Since you own the document passed to XPath, there is nothing it knows that can't be derived publicly.  </s>
<s> However, we can deduce from the XPath specification that the required information (e.g. namespace prefix) is available privately to the XPath evaluator.  </s>
<s> It must be available since otherwise the XPath evaluator would be unable to do anything with the initial namespace declarations created during evaluation context initialization.  </s>
<s> It is available to the XPath evaluator because it is in the document.  </s>
<s> It is passed to the XPath evaluator through the context node.  </s>
<s> You still have this information outside XPath.  </s>
<s> Since the required information is available internally, AND certain existing XPath function must be able to access that information, we can deduce that the information is available to XPath functions.  </s>
<s> Hence, since serialize() is defined as an XPath function, it must be able to access namespace prefixes and document order positions, whether or not they are in the public data model exposed to XPath expression authors.  </s>
<s> /john  </s>
<s> The serialize function has available what is passed into it as arguments.  </s>
<s> If it is a nodelist, the function can follow these pointers back to the original document, and get this information.  </s>
<s> Also, I think that serialization is the one thing that you would not expect an XPath engine to provide (unlike parsing).  </s>
<s> I do not expect an XPath engine to provide parsing.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's doesn't, as an example.  </s>
<s> john Microsoft has an XPath engine.  </s>
<s> Firstly, tell me where it is so I can look at it.  </s>
<s> IE5 shipped with an "XSL Pattern" engine in MSXML - see the selectNodes and selectSingleNode DOM extensions.  </s>
<s> The latest MSXML technology updates this to an almost complete subset of XPath.  </s>
<s> Docs and downloads can be found at  </s>
<s> Is it open source?  </s>
<s> No.  </s>
<s> Second, regardless of whether it provides a parser in the concrete sense, it must be coupled with a parser in the abstract sense.  </s>
<s> Indeed XPath evaluation is a service provided through DOM extensions, specifically as methods on DOM Node objects.  </s>
<s> The inverse would also be possible - an XPath object that was given various context nodes.  </s>
<s> Your spec should not unduly constrain the use of either of these types of implementation.  </s>
<s> Which XPath processor are you using to evaluate this design?  </s>
<s> I'm really only familiar with a small class of processors - Microsoft, Oracle, and to a lesser extent others within XSLT implementations.  </s>
<s> You must initialize the evaluation context, you must provide a context node, position and size, the context node, position and size together form a node-set, and the XPath evaluator must be able to derive from that node-set the namespace prefixes and the document order positions.  </s>
<s> Regardless of where you got the processor, you have had to create enough data structure SOMEHOW to support the described operations.  </s>
<s> /john  </s>
<s> Yes, which brings up a nasty point I hadn't realized before.  </s>
<s> Our implementation does not currently allow you to pass in any function bindings (except when used within XSLT).  </s>
<s> So I wouldn't be able to build a full implementation of XPath transforms on MSXML without some pretty painful hackery.  </s>
<s> It would be much easier if no extension functions were needed.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't put too much weight on this, but it may be evidence of a class of simple XPath processors that couldn't be used for XPath transforms.  </s>
<s> Likewise, my XML processor may indeed provide a serialization feature.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's does, for example.  </s>
<s> I'm not able to use the existing functionality that may be provided by a processor because a specific implementation strategy has been prescribed - the serialize() function.  </s>
<s> Now, I don't believe the Microsoft serializer IS quite adequate because your constraints are too severe - but that's a separate potential issue.  </s>
<s> john If your serialization function were adequate, then I wonder why you can't call it from your serialize() implementation?  </s>
<s> As to its adequacy, if the tool doesn't work, then don't use it.  </s>
<s> You can only reuse code in a new application if it fits the application.  </s>
<s> However, the serialization described in the spec is QUITE easy to implement, so I cannot fathom why it would be a 'potential issue'.  </s>
<s> /john  </s>
<s> I will defer this to another thread.  </s>
<s> As I indicated previously, I would not expect an XPath implementation to be optimized for returning the huge strings that could result from the serialize() function.  </s>
<s> And as I indicated previously, the necessity/danger of user intervention on the serialized string has not been justified.  </s>
<s> Even the necessity of a two-step process of serializing and then converting to UTF-8 gives me pause for thought - it looks like I might need two separate serialize() functionalities to obtain maximum performance.  </s>
<s> john The need for serialize() has been justified on several levels.  </s>
<s> Firstly, there is no security threat in allowing user intervention on the serialized node-set.  </s>
<s> My term "dangerous" was clearly a poor one in this context :-) I meant not that a security risk was imposed, but that it would be quite easy to damage the well-formedness of the XML document.  </s>
<s> Manipulating XML through string manipulation is unquestionably more prone to error than manipulating it through structural methods.  </s>
<s> You can tell the user "well, you're stupid and you broke it" but unless there is a compelling reason to ALLOW him to break it, it seems self-evident that it's best not to.  </s>
<s> For you to argue otherwise would require that you explain why it is significantly different from writing a different XPath expression.  </s>
<s> The XPath expression is signed, so its modification of the input follows a well-known behavior that we can prove is the correct behavior leading to the given message digest.  </s>
<s> Secondly, I've justified it from the specification standpoint.  </s>
<s> By defining the behavior as a function library addition to XPath, the result of the DSig WG's work can continue to be viewed as an application of XPath, not as an extension of XPath.  </s>
<s> XPath transforms is an application of XPath which is comprised of several parts: - parsing the document from a stream - identifying the nodes to keep/trim using an XPath  </s>
<s> - trimming the tree  </s>
<s> - serialization of the result Note that the last two are described as coincident by the serialize() function.  </s>
<s> This is a perfectly good application of XPath.  </s>
<s> Providing  </s>
<s> serialize() does not make it a better application of XPath, any more than removing it would make it less of an appropriate XPath application.  </s>
<s> If somehow it were shown that the serialize() function is necessary to make XPath transforms an application, what about the case when it is performed automatically?  </s>
<s> Does somehow this use constitute an XPath extension?  </s>
<s> The logic of your assertion totally escapes me.  </s>
<s> Thirdly, I've justified it on technical grounds.  </s>
<s> There is information required for serialization that is not available in the public information but which MUST be available to the implementations of certain XPath functions.  </s>
<s> Please have another look at how XPath handles the namespace declarations in the evaluation context.  </s>
<s> If I have misread something, please let me know, but I did ask for clarification on this point, and noone (including James Clark) has refuted this point yet.  </s>
<s> As for two serializations, that's not happening.  </s>
<s> The first act is a 'serialization' of the node-set.  </s>
<s> The second action is a character transcoding to UTF-8.  </s>
<s> My original assumption was that implementations would not lose track of the input document's encoding.  </s>
<s> This was based on the fact that I specified a parse() that would do this.  </s>
<s> You specifically along with others wanted to get rid of the parse().  </s>
<s> The natural result is that I can no longer claim that the input document stays in the same encoding.  </s>
<s> Since I also lose the BOM, UTF-8 is the only viable alternative.  </s>
<s> serialize(), however, cannot output UTF-8 because it is an XPath function, which must output a string.  </s>
<s> The details of what that means are specific to the XPath implementation itself.  </s>
<s> Transcoding to UTF-8 is not an action that fits within XPath.  </s>
<s> /john  </s>
<s> My concern here is that if serialize() is called automatically, I can envision a single step in which the document is serialize directly to UTF-8 as a performance gain.  </s>
<s> When serialize() is called explicitly, it looks like a two-step process is needed - serialize into a string to be returned from the XPath engine (presumeably Unicode) and then a conversion to UTF-8.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this is a real issue, but it does appear that there may be difference in optimization potential and thus performance between the two uses.  </s>
<s> Users would need to be aware that explicit use of serialize() may be slower than automatic use - another small argument against including it.  </s>
<s> I still don't understand this argument either.  </s>
<s> If the serialize function can be called automatically for nodesets as you prescribe, this would seem to indicate that there is not a necessity to expose it to the user in all cases.  </s>
<s> If you are not using the prescribed XPath extension mechanism in all cases, how does this contribute to maintaining "the property that dsig is an application of XPath"?  </s>
<s> The output of the XPath processor is not the end result of the transform in all cases.  </s>
<s> Doing more or less back-end work is a pretty abstract distinction.  </s>
<s> I feel that it is already an appropriate application of XPath to locate nodes in an XML document.  </s>
<s> Going beyond this to serializing within the XPath expression itself doesn't contribute to the impression that dsig is an XPath application.  </s>
<s> In fact, my gut feeling is that it is abuse because it appears to short-circuit the primary XPath return type of nodeset.  </s>
<s> john The specification very clearly points out that the XPath can return a node-set.  </s>
<s> However, to run a digest algorithm, we need a string.  </s>
<s> /john  </s>
<s> This is true but doesn't address my point.  </s>
<s> I think it's great that a user can return a nodeset and it'll get serialized automatically.  </s>
<s> In fact, it's so great I can't see why anyone would ever need to bother with calling serialize() explicitly.  </s>
<s> The redundancy argument still applies.  </s>
<s> I can call the serialize() function, or not, with the same result.  </s>
<s> Without some use cases justifying the need for the long form, the short form looks perfectly adquate to me.  </s>
<s> Note that there is no standard mechanism defined by XPath to "call" extension functions outside of the XPath expression.  </s>
<s> The XSLT spec carefully uses descriptions like "the resulting object is converted to a string _as_if_ by a call to the string function" (emph added.)  </s>
<s> A similar approach would be appropriate in describing XPath transforms.  </s>
<s> I don't see a concrete problem that serialize() solves.  </s>
<s> I do see some concrete reasons not to have it - performance, implementation flexibility, eliminating redundancy, simplified syntax.  </s>
<s> john Sure, as long as you can guarantee that the moment we yank serialize, we aren't going to have half a dozen different people writing in to say that "my-favorite-XPath-engine doesn't have access to namespace prefixes" or "my-favorite-XPath-engine makes it really inefficient to do document order".  </s>
<s> First of all, I can't guarantee people won't complain.  </s>
<s> I can't even guarantee their complaints won't be justified.  </s>
<s> I only can state that I'm not aware of any implementations that would have problems with this, and it's hard to imagine how they could and still conform to namespace nodes in the XPath data model.  </s>
<s> You have not previously presented evidence of such implementations or even their potential.  </s>
<s> My goal is to enable a wider range of XPath engines to be used, and I would welcome more details about constraints on specific implementations.  </s>
<s> Also, I do like the idea of being able to tweak the data in certain ways once it has been serialized.  </s>
<s> One could wrap a root element around a list of elements, one could prepend some simple material to make the result of the transform more usable to certain software.  </s>
<s> /john  </s>
<s> Structural manipulations like this should be left to XSLT, which is designed to perform exactly this type of operation without damaging well-formedness or the meaning of the document.  </s>
<s> In summary, I still haven't found even one of your arguments for exposing serialize() to the user compelling.  </s>
<s> Since we aren't converging on solutions, perhaps we should focus instead on converging on a clean statement of our different positions?  </s>
<s> There appears to be very little in the way of hard technical arguments either way, so a win/loss outcome seems unlikely.  </s>
<s> Hi John, If I have the following markup, How do I ask XPath for the xyz part of e?  </s>
<s> I seem to be able to find out that the element has a local name of e and a namespace uri of URI, but in order to serialize the element, I need to have the xyz.  </s>
<s> What function or node tells me this?  </s>
<s> John Boyer Software Development Manager PureEdge Solutions, Inc. (formerly UWI.Com) Creating Binding E-Commerce jboyer@PureEdge.com  </s>
<s> Donald-LDE008; TAMURA Kent; Christopher R. Maden; Ed Simon  </s>
