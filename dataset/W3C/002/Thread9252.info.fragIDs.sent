<s> Issue rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty: Is a super/sub-property of a transitive property necessarily transitive?  </s>
<s> e.g. anc is a transitive property par is a sub-property of anc but is not transitive anc-or-unc is a super-property of anc but is not transitive  </s>
<s> Might be good to explain that 'anc' means 'ancestor' and 'par' means 'parent' and 'unc' means whatever it does mean (uncle??).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, the point of the example is rather opaque.  </s>
<s> You are right (perfect guess!), it's better to have those names.  </s>
