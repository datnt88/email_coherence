<s> Here's some questions (with proposed answers) to get us thinking about rdfms-graph.  </s>
<s> I'm also curious whether there are other questions that should be considered part of the resolution --  </s>
<s> the issue description isn't really enough for me to tell.  </s>
<s> 1) Does an RDF graph have a URI?  </s>
<s> It is a Resource, and it can.  </s>
<s> M&amp;S does not define a specific one.  </s>
<s> 2) Is an RDF graph a set or a bag?  </s>
<s> A set, as it has conjunctive assertion semantics, or whatever they're called: (A &amp;&amp; A) = (A) 3) Can a node exist in a graph without any properties?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> This is indicated in the current XML syntax with an empty Description element.  </s>
<s> Do people disagree and/or think there are other questions that need to be answered?  </s>

<s> The use case I have in mind is a metadata repository where new resources are constantly being added, but they may be 'tagged' at a later time.  </s>
<s> In this case, an empty would indicate that the resource urn:myscheme:some_object_id is a part of the current domain of discourse, but nothing has been said about it.  </s>
<s> So the resource is flagged as one that needs someone to meta-tag it.  </s>
<s> Of course, there are many other ways to solve this such as meta-meta info to indicate the tagging information, but this isn't reason enough to explicitly disallow it... cheers, - steve Stephen Petschulat Graham Klyne imore.com  </s>

<s> Your approach seems entirely reasonable to me as an application design, but  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that it's something we want to be forced to standardize, which I fear may be the result of allowing it in the abstract RDF syntax.  </s>
<s> E.g. when exchanging RDF between systems (the reason for standardization), do we really want to specify that the existence of a node, without properties, is significant?  </s>
<s> If so, we must define the significance, and that looks  </s>
<s> awkward to me.  </s>
<s> I suppose I'm not arguing to prohibit property-less nodes so much as saying I don't think we should try to define them as part of a standard.  </s>
<s> IMO, the abstract syntax and associated semantics where such things appear is intended to unambiguously specify the intent of what we do define, not to prohibit (or say anything about) what we don't define.  </s>
