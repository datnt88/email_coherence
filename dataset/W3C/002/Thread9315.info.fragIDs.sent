<s> I know what this is getting at (and I know why "thingies" is being used), but on the other hand, you've got to admit the humor in a bare reading of this, which suggests we're going to clarify the semantics of RDF by mapping its concepts to "thingies" (or groupings of them).  </s>

<s> Seems like it would be a rather significant change to: if subjects and predicates could be literals.  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> The revised MT allows this, but if the syntax excludes it, the model theory will not complain.  </s>
<s> However, it does suggest that there is no pressing need to exclude it, at least on semantic grounds.  </s>

<s> This would be OK if the EXT mapping were extended to the set LV of literal values, but I didnt know if that was considered legitimate.  </s>

<s> It also easy to have only some literal values be predicatable, as long as we can characterize the relevant subset.  </s>
