<s> Can we assume that TLDs will be non-numeric?  </s>
<s> It looks to me that the BNF is ambiguous between hostname and IPv4 addresses because the BNF for hostname doesn't rule out  </s>

<s> Larry  </s>
<s> Yes, but we can't assume that the last domain is a TLD.  </s>
<s> Yes, it says that in the text describing the rule: The production for host is ambiguous because it does not completely distinguish between an IPv4address and a hostname.  </s>
<s> Again, the "first-match-wins" algorithm applies: If host matches the production for IPv4address, then it should be considered an IPv4 address literal and not a hostname.  </s>
<s> All of our attempts to disambiguate within the grammar itself did not work because, without a trailing ".", there is no way to know which is the TLD.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> there's no document I am aware of that explicitly precludes "numeric" TLDs.  </s>
<s> RFC 1123, section 2.1 says "... at least the highest-level component label will be alphabetic" but that's probably due to the fact that additional TLDs were not yet on the table.  </s>
<s> I'd see that as descriptive instead of normative.  </s>
<s> However, as a consequence, hostnames that look like IP addresses are (obviously) not allowed, and operational wisdom will hopefully continue to help this assumtion be true.  </s>
<s> Again, the "." is not part of the domain name.  </s>
<s> It's a user interface issue, as is using non-FQDNs.  </s>
<s> In the context of UR*, the "U" doesn't really make sense for non-FQDNs.  </s>
<s> -Peter  </s>
<s> I guess we need to make sure we have similar text in IRI.  </s>
<s> BTW Roy, when can we expect your revised RFC2396 text to move ahead?  </s>
<s> IRI has a dependency on it.  </s>

<s> I cannot tell you when it will move ahead -- it was ready to move ahead five months ago when a dozen people suddenly decided to read the whole thing and submit comments without considering the discussion already on the mailing list.  </s>
<s> The comments created an entry-barrier that has been difficult to overcome due to other stuff of greater importance (getting married).  </s>
<s> The next draft will probably be generated next week at ApacheCon, after which you can gauge the winds of IETF as well as I. ....Roy  </s>
