prepared to comment on scope, structure and outline and any related related documents that might be of interest.

A minor quibble: I am listed (last bullet) as taking a crack at "Layered Examples (aka 'roll your own'); just to clarify, what I agreed to take a crack at here was how you layer DAML (and/or presumably other languages) on RDF (i.e., how you get from RDF to languages like DAML). 
I didn't want anyone to be misled as to what I was planning to work on (in addition to the Basic Data Model discussion, that is).

Eric, I've just noticed that two weeks have flashed by since the primer telecon and we all promised to produce something by then... er, now. 
Where do you want us to send copy? 
Is there a central place or should we use the maillist or are you looking after it?

Please at least copy the main RDF Core WG mailing list (putting the string 'PRIMER' in the subject line so we can find it again). 
Thanks, Dan 
I've got a draft of a model section *almost* (but not quite) ready to go out; should ship tomorrow or Sunday.

:) yeah... blink and 2 weeks have passed 
Assignments should be sent to the w3c-rdfcore-wg list with PRIMER in the header. 
From here I'll integrate these into a (more) coherent whole and announce the results.

excellent... thanks Frank! 
Attention Primer subgroup... what's the status on the other assignments? 
An elevator speech (1, 3, 5 min explanations) was agreed to be of use for the first category of people. 
Ora and Eric agreed to start working on this. 
Due to the fact that both are traveling next week, they agreed to have something available two weeks from the meeting date. 
? 
Basic Data Model: Frank and Pat agreed to start working on the Basic Data Model ? 
Reification: Bill will work on this as he's spent a lot of time in the past thinking/explaining this part of the spec ? 
Typing System: Ora will take a crack at the Typing System section ? 
Light Weight Ontology: Sean agrees to work on this section ? 
Layered Examples (aka 'roll your own'): Frank will take a crack at how you layer DAML (and/or presumably other languages) on RDF (i.e., how you get from RDF to languages like DAML).
