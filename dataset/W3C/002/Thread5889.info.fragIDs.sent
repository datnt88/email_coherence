Hi Folks, I have several questions: 1. XML Schema distinguishes between "defining" and "declaring", e.g., you "define" types, but you "declare" elements. 
Does OWL make such a distinction? 
That is, do you "define" a class, or do you "declare" a class? 
Do you "define" a property, or do you "declare" a property? 
2. Consider this ObjectProperty (er) definition from the OWL Guide: 1 
I have two questions about it: (a) How is it different than if rdfs:range had been used: 
1 
If the two forms are equivalent, then when should each form be used? 
(b) I am struggling to understand why one would ever put a cardinality 
in a property definition - cardinality seems to me to be something that a class would want to assert, i.e., "when used in this class the property has a cardinality of 1". Can someone please elaborate upon when you would use cardinality in a property definition? 
Thanks! /Roger 
Roger, I inadvertently left you and public-webont-comments off my 
message [1] yesterday in response to your question. 
The WebOnt members meeting in Boston subsequently agreed that there are problems with several of the examples in 
Appendix C of the OWL Guide. 
Thanks!

Subject: ObjectProperty defined using rdfs:range, equivalent to using owl:allValuesFrom?

OWL doesn't really have any notion of defining or declaring. 
There are some aspects of these, but really all you do is provide information about a class, a property, or an individual. 
This is an error in the Guide. 
Part of the meaning of this can be captured as but this misses the part that would appear to require that the property is total. 
If it was valid syntax, it should mean the same as if rdfs:range was used. 
Only one is possible. 
In general, global conditions of this sort are to be avoided. 
Instead use restrictions, which are local to classes. 
Sometimes, however, it is useful to provide a global domain or range. 
Also, some conditions on properties can only be stated globally, such as transitivity and inverse.
