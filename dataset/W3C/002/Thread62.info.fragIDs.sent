<s> However, about 2 days or so ago the volume went from probably 20 msg a month or so to a hundred or more a day.  </s>

<s> Two things appear to have gone wrong in the very week that I was travelling and away from email!  </s>
<s> First there were a lot of bounced messages Second there was some weird problem whereby old mail was suddenly reposted without any obvious reason.  </s>
<s> Our sysadmin kindly noticed the problem and stepped in with a fix - thanks Gerald!  </s>
<s> Hopefully the volume of email will drop to a low level as I for one can't afford much time to work on Tidy.  </s>
<s> There are more pressing tasks such as drafting briefing packages and charters for further work on HTML at W3C. Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>
