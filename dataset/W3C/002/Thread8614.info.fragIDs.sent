<s> Hi Eric, I'd be interested in a more specific version of your comments.  </s>
<s> Although, c14n is doing what is intended, there is some good food for thought (below) if I've interpreted you correctly.  </s>
<s> Also, please refer to the version of the document you are reading.  </s>
<s> My comments refer to [1].  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-c14n-20000907  </s>
<s> Firstly, C14N is actually best-suited to standalone documents.  </s>
<s> However, I think you are using the term 'standalone document' to mean something different than its definition in the XML 1.0 specification.  </s>
<s> I believe you mean that you want to canonicalize the file containing the root element, but not include information that the document obtains from external sources.  </s>
<s> See below for some advice on this.  </s>
<s> In general, it is a good thing that the canonical form should change the information value of the document changes by simply moving it to a different box.  </s>
<s> It is, at that point, a different XML document, and it is the stated purpose of C14N to report a difference.  </s>
<s> However, the term 'document' as it appears in XML 1.0 is seemingly different from how you are using it.  </s>
<s> By document, you seem to mean 'file containing root element'.  </s>
<s> Again, see below for some advice on this.  </s>
<s> As for the loss of DTD (as well as the loss of entity references), we're aware that we're tossing out this information.  </s>
<s> We're doing this so that C14N can be implemented with baseline XML 1.0 processors.  </s>
<s> For the most part, the loss of information does not hurt the canonical form, but there are a few limitations, which are given in [1] (as well as advice on how to avoid or overcome these limitations).  </s>
<s> However, I cannot tell for sure, but it sounds like you may be trying to use canonical forms in the creation of a XML document development environment, not an XML processing application.  </s>
<s> I can imagine that your processing needs would be far greater than those of an XML 1.0 processing application.  </s>
<s> However, it also stands to reason that you would have much more sophisticated tools at your disposal than we are assuming.  </s>
<s> As such, may I recommend a simple round of pre-processing and post-processing.  </s>
<s> Firstly, the loss of entity references seems to be causing difficulty.  </s>
<s> However, in a development environment, your tool simply *must* be able to track any and all entity references, so turning each reference into character data before running the canonicalizer should be a piece of cake.  </s>
<s> Secondly, your tool simply must have access to the doctypedecl, so prepending it to the canonical form as a post-processing step of canonicalization should also be simple.  </s>
<s> The results of these two easy steps should make the canonical forms of much more value within your application.  </s>
<s> In general, the core specification cannot assume the implementer has access to such advanced tools, but perhaps an additional paragraph in the limitations section spelling out the information above wouldn't hurt.  </s>
<s> Please let us know if this information works for you, or please feel free to elaborate if I've gone down a path other than the one you intended...  </s>

<s> John, There were 2 different comments in my email, sorry if I haven't been clear about it.  </s>
<s> In both cases, I am not questioning the legitimacy of the behavior defined in c14n, but rather suggesting to clarify the point in the spec.  </s>
<s> The first point which was my starting point is about comparing 2 XML documents (or maybe should I say files) considered as standalone including their internal document type definitions.  </s>
<s> I reckon that it's a specific need which should be addressed using specific tools.  </s>
<s> One of the way to do it is to use a specific parser like the one I have described in a recent article [r1] and eventually to use its canonized output.  </s>
<s> [r1] http://www.xml.com/pub/2000/08/09/xslt/xslt.html  </s>
<s> The second point was to highlight the fact that a canonical XML document, even if you control it's source as a file (stored in your local hard drive), is a function of many factors (including the time and the full request header sent to include the external entities) and that you are canonizing a picture of this file/document rather than the file/document itself.  </s>
<s> This point is independent of the first one (even if it's related) but I think it might be worse mentioning it and it's about this second point only that I had written:  </s>
<s> I am reading this same version.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I meant the document considered as standalone (like if we had forced its standalone attribute to "yes").  </s>
<s> Yes, I should have written "file" rather than "document".  </s>
<s> Yes, I agree.  </s>
<s> Yes, it's basically what I have described in [r1].  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> In fact you've gone one of the paths I intended !  </s>
<s> Thanks Eric  </s>
