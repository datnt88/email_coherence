<s> Hello Alan, You mentioned it, DASL define a mini query language to query property mostly and "server-defined" query languages, that can do want they want (the only thing those languages need is clients supporting those languages).  </s>

<s> In the past, we produced both a Scenarios and a Requirements specification.  </s>
<s> I believe that both are still largely valid.  </s>
<s> The only significant new factor that has emerged since these documents were initially drafted is the XML Query effort.  </s>
<s> The scenarios and requirements documents can be found at: - Jim  </s>
<s> That's what I would think as well...  </s>
<s> Both properties and content searchability would be good.  </s>
<s> Not sure if anybody ever answered your basic question about whether DASL addresses content querying.  </s>
<s> It does.  </s>
<s> Here is the query fragment that would search the body of a document: This is similar to the property queries, but it does not name a property, therefore it's the content that must be searched for the string.  </s>
<s> Note that it's possible to do exact string matching ("Peter Forsberg") and string-by-string matching ("Peter" and "Forsberg", not necessarily together).  </s>
<s> Section 5.13.1 of DASL shows both examples.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> Lisa, which version are you referring to?  </s>
<s> According to [1],  </s>
<s> - "contains" is an optional operator (so cou can't rely on it being supported)  </s>
<s> - the method of matching is only loosely defined; in particular you can't rely on it doing "exact" matching.  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.webdav.org/dasl/protocol/draft-dasl-protocol-00.html  </s>
<s> true  </s>
<s> true.  </s>
<s> I was looking at the same draft.  </s>
<s> But I think Alan wanted to know if DASL addressed body content searching at all, which it does.  </s>
<s> If the server supports it, the client can use it (as usual).  </s>
<s> lisa  </s>
<s> This may be a bit of a can of worms, but is there any interest in using the structure of content in queries?  </s>
<s> For example, being able to query on the content's "Title" or "Author".  </s>
<s> I am thinking of Dublin Core metadata sort of approach - not XPath or XML Query since the content can be anything (PDF, GIF, etc).  </s>
<s> Allowing something like Dublin Core would allow a level of structure to be imposed.  </s>
<s> If this was considered useful, would the better approach be to define additional live properites that were automatically extracted from the content (hence its really just querying on properties after all, not content itself), or to allow querying on properties or content.  </s>
<s> I guess I am sort of asking should allprops return the Dublin Core like elements too?  </s>
<s> (It could be expensive to compute).  </s>
<s> I do a fair bit of work with a search and retrieval protocol, Z39.50.  </s>
<s> It is based on the Dublin Core idea of separating your access points for searching from the physical representation of the data.  </s>
<s> It allows querying on "Title" as an abstract concept, without requiring that it be possible to return a "Title" out from the data.  </s>
<s> It takes a different view on query capabilities too - it says you have terms that can have constraints applied.  </s>
<s> Specifying a property name to search within is a constraint.  </s>
<s> Specifying  (greater than) is a constraint.  </s>
<s> It does not use 3 value logic.  </s>
<s> It more says 'return all records that contain some data that match the condition'.  </s>
<s> WebDAV might not have the same problem of repeating values as properites have only one value.  </s>
<s> Personally I would like to search on parts of the content using Dublin Core (or other) metadata standards.  </s>
<s> Should I do this using WebDAV properties bound to parts of the content of the resource?  </s>
<s> Any other ideas?  </s>
<s> Thanks Alan ps: I am not likely to do this any time soon.  </s>
<s> Just thinking about the future.  </s>
