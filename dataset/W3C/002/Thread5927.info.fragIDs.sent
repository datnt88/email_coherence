<s> Yaron How about this as an idea ... Commerce One changes our IP statement on the WS Chor from "undeclared" - which coincindentally is the same as BEA's - to one of "non-declared (RF)", i.e. if there are any patents which Commerce One owns in the ideas in the spec (which I don't beleive there are) then they would be made available on RF terms - I don't have the precise legalese but I will get it.  </s>
<s> Also please note that my original email stated an intention, which still stands, that IF the spec was adopted we would give the relevant IP to the W3C.  </s>
<s> This means, more specifically, that we would give the copyright to the W3C (since that is the only real IP we have) and also make available on RF terms any "essential claims" in patents that are required to implement the spec that might exist - which is what you really need to do.  </s>
<s> However, as I don't believe Commerce One has any patents (I'm double checking) you seem to be demanding, before you read the spec, that we give away IP to the W3C that we can't give because it doesn't exist.  </s>
<s> This does not make sense.  </s>
<s> Now let's look at this from a Commerce One perspective.  </s>
<s> If I adopt your reasoning, it would suggest that Commerce One (or anyone else for that matter) should not read any BEA specs for the same reasons as you state - we would run a risk of "polluting" our ideas with BEA IP without knowing what the consequences are.  </s>
<s> Removing this risk would require that BEA make an immediate declaration that any IP you have that could affect the development of the choreography spec be made available on RF terms.  </s>
<s> Is BEA prepared to do this?  </s>
<s> If you don't does it mean I shouldn't read any of your emails as I might be polluting my thinking with BEA's ideas which could mean that BEA will charge me royalties later?  </s>
