At last Friday's telecon we discussed how to proceed with the datatypes document. 
I believe the following suggestion was made and found support: o that we publish a datatyping WD o the we reaffirm our decision that the datatyping work is rec track o that we keep open the option of merging the datatyping WD into other documents in the future (likely schema and model theory) To keep things moving along, I propose that we adopt this plan.

I support this plan.

I not only support it; I encourage you and Pat to work on getting a draft for the WG to look at :) It doesn't require a WG meeting decision in order for people to get draft docs for review.

The timeframe/schedule I have in my mind is to have a rough draft to the WG by April 4th, then weekly revisions to the WG thereafter, and a first public draft just before the WWW conf, around May 1st.

I'll be out of town at a meeting.
