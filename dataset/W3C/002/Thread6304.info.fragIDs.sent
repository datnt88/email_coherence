<s> Agreed! I love the new design.  </s>
<s> It's a keeper!  </s>

<s> Hi, the new (25 Aug 2000) design of your front page is a big improvement from earlier, IMO.  </s>
<s> /Mats Nygren  </s>
<s> Overall, I like it.  </s>
<s> A few suggestions though... gotta suggest something...  </s>
<s> It would be handy to include links to the specs on the front page.  </s>
<s> for exmple, to reach the HTML 4.01spec, you have to click on HTML and hunt around... it's one quarter down the page ... unless you spot the HTML 4/3.2.0 link about 3/4 down the page... in which case you then have to click yet again.  </s>
<s> To make the list a bit quicker to scanyou could then nest items, e.g. o HTML - 4.01 spec - HTML Tidy - HTML Validator The HTML link goes to the home page of course.  </s>
<s> It would be convenient for people with screenreaders to have links at the top jumping to the index, news, and sitemap (or whatever to call the second column).  </s>
<s> Otherwise they have to tab through all those links on the left...  </s>
<s> You might want them to define a class that makes them hidden to keep the present look.  </s>
<s> It's good that you described the layout in the table summary, but the links would be more useful.  </s>
<s> I looked at the use of H2 and H3 (using the WAVE, and although they make the size of the type right, they don't really seem to be the logical choice.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest re-doing to use them in more logical order and then using CSS to get the sizes what you want.  </s>
<s> Aside from that though, which is getting into the details.  </s>
<s> good job!  </s>

<s> This is a good point.  </s>
<s> However, we intend to address it by improving the TR page rather than putting more links on the home page.  </s>
<s> For instance, we'd like to allow users to search for specs by title, author, etc.  </s>
<s> That's a pending project...  </s>
<s> There are links at the top defined by the LINK element.  </s>
<s> Lynx renders these, for instance.  </s>
<s> But they are not rendered on the screen by most browsers.  </s>
<s> Ok, we'll look at that.  </s>
