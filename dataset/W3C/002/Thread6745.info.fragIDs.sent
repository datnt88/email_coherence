What is the accepted way of doing links in the published HTML for W3C specs? 
Specifically, I'm concerned with the use link targets such link such as a href="#foo" . 
While this is allowable in XHTML, this is not compatible with HTML and does not follow the XHTML guidelines for compatibility with HTML browsers; such links do not work, for example, in Netscape 4.x browsers. 
I have noted an increasing number of such links in W3C documents, and I note with great concern that the W3C link validator does not even so much as give a warning for such links which are effectively BROKEN for all Netscape users. 
Personally, I'd like to see our pub styles indicate that W3C specs should follow the XHTML compatibility guideline are used, and I'd like to see the link validator give errors (or at least warnings) for link targets using an id since that won't work in many of the deployed browsers.

I agree with Paul that the XHTML compatibility guidelines are a good idea to maintain for our specs.

One clarification: this *is* compatible with HTML, see "12.2.3 Anchors with the id attribute" [1] of HTML 4, for example. 
RFC 2070 [2], which was published in January 1997 (as old as HTML 3.2), also added the "id" attribute on most elements. 
The "id" attribute can be found even in the first proposal of HTML+ (in 1993), so this is really an "old" feature in HTML. 
Nowadays almost all browsers except Netscape 4.x supports the "id" attribute as an anchor. 
You may call it as an incompatibility with legacy HTML browsers (such as Netscape 4.x), but please don't call it as an incompatibility with HTML. 
Because it is Netscape 4.x which is broken, not links. 
I'm not against using both the "id" and "name" attributes (when it is feasible), but the link validator MUST NOT give "errors" for perfectly valid link targets, and they do work in many of the deployed browsers (except Netscape 4.x).

I believe it is also the case that where Netscape 4x would display alt text as a tooltip, but not title text, Netscape 6x displays title text in the tooltip, but not alt text. 
Do people think we should (on practical grounds) apply the same text to both alt and title elements, or is it better practise to wean people off the idea that alt text will appear in a tooltip?

No question that Netscape 4.x is broken in this respect, but... 
...[change "give errors" to "give warnings" and] I disagree completely here. 
The validator gives warnings for things 
like a missing or extra trailing slash and such, and the fact is that for the large proportion of real people out there using Netscape 4.x, these links simply do not work. 
Let's face facts, if the W3C were a corporation trying to attract customers with its public web site, it wouldn't put up pages that don't work for a large segment of the population regardless of "whose fault it is." 
We should change the validator so that it gives warnings for links that do not follow the XHTML compatibility guidelines.

...[change "give errors" to "give warnings" and] I don't disagree with you. 
We should clearly distinguish errors and warnings, that's why I quoted "errors".

Well, alt text is required by HTML, and by WCAG - 2 W3C recommendations. 
Putting the same thing into a title attribute that is in an alt attribute isn't an intrinsically bad thing, but it isn't the best way to go in some circumstances either. 
Title doesn't seem to mean the same thing as alt (although it isn't so well defined what title _does_ mean). 
title is probably about the closest thing to a 'tooltip' attribute that there is (although the concept plays a little differently in a voice-based system, of course).
