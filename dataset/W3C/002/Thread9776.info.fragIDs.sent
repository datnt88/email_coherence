Given that I objected to the proposed resolution of this issue at the last meeting I have been asked to provide an alternative resolution. 
My proposal: An rdf:ID attribute is permissable on all property elements and always refers to the resource that is the reification of the triple corresponding to that property element. 
Notes: - this allows rdf:ID and rdf:resource on the same property element which is a change. 
- this favours a reading of the relevant contradiction in M&amp;S in which para232 is dropped and para214 is preferred. 
Reasons for this are: 
- M&amp;S is contradictory and has widely varying implementations of its reification syntax. 
- This WG must resolve the contradiction. 
- My proposed resolution is very simple, and hence makes reification significantly more usable, and less of a barrier to RDF take-up. 
More detail in: I will post a follow-up with some implementation details. 
Jeremy 
The important test cases are: [1] RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:a="http://example.org/" [2] RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:a="http://example.org/" [3] RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:a="http://example.org/" The current WD (which is like a reading of M&amp;S giving priority to para232 over para214) has [1] as identifying the object resource, and [2] as identifying the reification and [3] as undefined. 
M&amp;S with the priority-reading gives [3] as reification. 
No implementations that I know of implement M&amp;S with the priority-reading in that if [1] is reification then so is [3]. 
(No - I haven't checked SiRPAC - this might do it). 
Some implementations have [1] as reification (e.g. RDFFilter; resource (e.g. VRP, http://wonkituck.wi-inf.uni-essen.de/rdfs.html 
).

I like this proposal.

That is much more regular and simple. 
I remember the first time I spotted para 232 and was 'surprised'. 
I see no contradiction. 
I see an overriding of a general rule in a specific case. 
The original WG did not have to include the bit about ID in para232. 
They could have said nothing. 
The fact they did say something suggests to me that they MEANT to override para214. 
In my view, what you propose is better than the original, but it is a change to the original spec, not a clarification of a contradiction. 
Is that true of the common case? 
That is over egging things a bit. 
Do you really think the problems with reification lie in this obscure bit of syntax? 
Brian 
I tend to agree with Jeremy here. 
I think that being able to use the rdf:ID= syntax consistently to identify the subject of the reification quad, and to imply the presence of the quad statements in the graph, would make reification much more comfortable to use. 
Much criticism of reification has been about the triple-bloat. 
I expect that implementations can optimize the internal storage of triples to overcome this; Jeremy's proposal makes a similar optimization available in the XML-serialized form.

Jeremy: 
Brian: 
We differ. 
It is true that it is a change; but we are required to change contradictory text. 
Jeremy: 
Brian: 
This is one of the problems. 
My personal preference is to drop reification entirely; I am not yet ready to propose that yet. 
If we are keeping it we should do our best to make it usable, within the constraints of our charter. 
I feel very unhappy with keeping reification if we do not address any of the problems with it.

I should state in advance that I had no intention of causing Jeremy to explode!... 
I wrote some test cases ages ago that did this (just about when we started producing these). 
However, in an IRC conversation with Brian I had to concede that what I'd suggested (which is what you propose) was not the current state of play regarding whatever meaning could be gleaned from the M+S - rdf:ID plays an overloaded role in that document. 
We both comiserated but at the time, it seemed that producing test cases that describe what the M+S said (not what we thought it should say) was the honest thing to do; this is the (spurious?) backwards-compatibility argument. 
If we're going to produce a uniform interpretation for rdf:id then I'm all for what you propose. 
I was still labouring under the (mis?)apprehension that such tidying behaviour required more than an asthetic argument* if it was going to break/change the meaning of existing RDF documents.

Not as randy or clumsom as a blaster. 
I find it spurious. 
It is at least as honest to say that M&amp;S does not make sense, and has not had sense made out of it by the community. 
BTW: The first version of ARP implemented my proposed resolution, but Brian persuaded me that I should do otherwise about version 1.0.3. 
I probably would have done better to have dug my heals in then.
