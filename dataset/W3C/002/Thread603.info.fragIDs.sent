<s> "table" is for tabular data, not for layout.  </s>
<s> If it's just layout that your after, Alex, then ask yourself if it can be done without table entirely, or at least will minimal use of tables.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you'll wind ut with just one table per form.  </s>
<s> In any case the extra white space after the form can be gotten rid of in MSIE4/5 by including this style sheet info: form { margin-bottom: 0; } Nescape 4 pays little attention to that, but who really cares about Netscape 4 these days?  </s>
