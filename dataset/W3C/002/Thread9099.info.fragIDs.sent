<s> Hello *, Is it a validity signature ship W3C XML Signature standards?  </s>
<s> Original XML: Hello,world!  </s>
<s> Hello,everybody!  </s>
<s> Signed XML: Hello, Reference URI="#AMsgSign"" Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#signatureProerties" World Hello,everyBody!  </s>
<s> Many Thanks, Amdrew  </s>
<s> (a) You missed some tags (e.g the closing tag from the SignatureProperty) (b) you have multiple root elements (two msg elements) (c) it seems that you don't sign the message itself, but only the properties (only on reference for #AMsgSign)  </s>
<s> But regardsless of these, it looks good.  </s>
<s> But I guess that's not what you wanted to sign.  </s>

<s> Yes, I just want to sign part of one xml elementary element instead of the whole element.  </s>
<s> But I'm not sure whether XML Signature standards permit this.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Christian!  </s>

<s> Hi Andrew, Not directly.  </s>
<s> All of the text in an element is gathered as one text node as far as Xpath filtering is concerned.  </s>
<s> Your application is free to put this extra information into the message element before signing, though.  </s>
