<s> Hi all, Here are some requirements for our discussion on Monday... User should be able to know what their permissions are on attributes before trying Query across attributes (in one service): what query language?  </s>
<s> Ability to know (partial?) list of attributes at design time Ability to know type of attributes ahead of time Input/output messages that manipulate attributes can be validated against WSDL Support for static attributes Ability to restrict access on a per attribute basis.  </s>
<s> Ability to restrict read vs. write access Attributes can be inherited through WSDL 1.2 inheritance Support metadata on attributes (creation date, type, description...) Allow bulk retrieval of several attributes in one operation Attributes can be of any schema type (simple or complex) Regards, William William Vambenepe Web Services Management Operation HP OpenView Division  </s>

<s> Our goal should *not* be to develop max number of specifications, but a few cohesive and coherent specifications.  </s>
<s> As you probably know by now, I disagree with this statement :-) Suggesting that the WSDL specification should talk about required or optional operations is like saying that the C++ language specification dictates the use of commit() and abort() methods because some applications require transactional behaviour.  </s>

<s> I thought that attributes were about exposing access to state and not about stateful web services.  </s>
<s> I see a subtle difference.  </s>
<s> The web services-oriented architecture is stateless.  </s>
<s> Attributes could provide the syntax for exposing state but the semantics of stateful services should not be part of a WSDL specification (that's my personal view anyway).  </s>
<s> IMHO, it would be better if we address the security interfaces in this specification, leaving, of course, the implementations to  </s>

<s> I differentiate between mechanics and mechanisms we define the mechanics, the platforms do the mechanisms.  </s>
<s> In that  </s>

<s> these security aspects are NOT orthogonal to the serviceData  </s>
<s> mechanics.  </s>
<s> I see transactions, coordination, orchestration, business processes as very important in web services.  </s>
<s> They all require common interfaces.  </s>
<s> Should we also include these in the specification of the language that is used to describe those interfaces?  </s>

<s> Perhaps the analogy is not to a C++ language specification, but to a component model.  </s>
<s> It is not the language specification that dictates the usage of some interfaces or methods, but the definition of these models.  </s>
<s> For example, EJB 2.0 CMP model defines both attributes that describe state in its abstract model and also well defined syntax to access these attributes via get/set methods.  </s>
<s> Without defining how the access should happen in a uniform and well understood way, just defining a set of attributes may not be that useful.  </s>
<s> What I am not clear about is your position actually.  </s>
<s> I have been trying to follow your postings.  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting that a set of attributes that describe state is not a useful concept or are you suggesting that providing an agreed convention for accessing them (perhaps via a set of operation conventions) should not be targeted by the WSD wg?  </s>

<s> At best, the assertion we can make is that there is no well defined mechanism for defining explicitly what external state is, or how internal state is exposed.  </s>
<s> If I were to provide a counter method on a service which returned the next integer to the client, would this service be stateless or would its state be undefined with respect to WSDL today?  </s>
