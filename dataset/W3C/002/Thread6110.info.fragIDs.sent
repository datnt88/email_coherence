But if the policy cannot reference the choreography then it becomes a 
useless policy. 
In case of doubt, I am not saying that the choreography should reference the policy, but that the policy should reference the choreography. 
This type of issue the tip of a HUGE iceberg, specifically how do you 
combine things together. 
Now this is not, IMO, part of the discussion for this group, but to get flexibility in automated systems that is comparable to that which humans can provide, there is a lot of work to be done. 
To illustrate lets take a few examples of the combinations that you might need to consider in order to make a decision on what to do ... 1. Choreographies are only allowed if the messages are digitally signed. 
2. Business Partners require that messages are digitally signed. 
3. A partner requires that the messages sent to some, but not all, of the services they offer are digitally signed. 
4. Repeat the above with some combination of reliable messaging protocol (you can chose your flavor) 5. Repeat the above with different message formats depending on the location in which they are being used, for example you need VAT in europe and sales tax in the US. ... and I haven't even started to consider some of the policy decisions you mentioned earlier such as whether or not international orders are accepted. 
If you think about the number of possible combinations or matches you would have to make in order to realize interoperability is effectively infinite. 
This means that: 1. 
You can't test them all - there are too many 2. The SME's won't implement them all - they can't afford to. 
The only way out of this is to define profiles of sets of accepted standards and policies that apply - unfortunately no one is working on this ... yet.

DB I think it more likely that the policies will most often apply to services rather than choreographies. 
For example the "no international orders" policy could apply to *all* orders. 
The actual choreography used to place the order is irrelevant. 
/DB 
That's precisely my point. 
I want to find specific services based on the policy. 
For example, if the policy says "no international order" and some service says "I use this policy" and "My country != 
US", then I would not bother using that service. 
DB Yes there is. 
But it is only really relevant to your internal business process (or orchestration) rather than to the choreography because ultimately only the sender of the order and nobody but the sender of the order can decide whether or not to send the order - it's a private process. 
/DB 
Let's say that I find a service. 
I find a policy. 
There is no association between the policy and the choreography. 
Finding the policy is as useful as knowing that the service definition was created on a Sunday afternoon. 
But if there is some way for me to determine that the service would apply the policy as part of the chorography, then MY implementation can do a lot of interesting things, like favoring or avoiding that particular service. 
Of course it's only relevant to my internal implementation, and if my internal implementation never evaluates the policy it would still be acting based on the choreography. 
Which is something I don't belive we've refuted so far. 
But if the policy cannot reference the choreography then it becomes a 
useless policy. 
In case of doubt, I am not saying that the choreography should reference the policy, but that the policy should reference the choreography.

I understand what you say, I don't understand how it relates to what I have said. 
Here's a case in point. 
On-line banking. 
All messages digitially signed, sent over RM, for all message formats ever used. 
Mandated by banks, FDIC, the Global Domination ATM Network, or whoever. 
Doesn't matter. 
There is no complexity in reach agreement it's a done deal. 
The bank also have policies that apply to specific accounts which may be FDIC, bank-specific, IRS, BBB whatever. 
I don't care how expensive it is to define these rules because the rules would be defined regardless of which technology we use. 
In fact, they are already defined. 
And I don't care how expensive it is to reach agreement with a million customers because the bank simply publishes it's rules - take it or leave it - and does not try to reach agreement. 
And I don't care if UDDI is trusted or not, because the bank already has mechanisms to make it available securely from a trusted source. 
But, I know that some rules are different from bank to bank (e.g. the cost of a returned check) and some rules are different from account to account within the same bank (e.g. the cost of an overdraft withdrawl). 
And given that the rules are already there, I can select which account to use when/where, if I only know which rules apply to which operation I am about to perform. 
So yes, there is complexity in the world and we haven't solved it. 
And it applies in a lot of cases that like it or not will not be able to use the capbilities we are discussing right now because they already have too many problems reaching agreement. 
And any solution to that problem is outside of this working group. 
But there are too many use cases where it's simply not-a-problem. 
It's not a problem to reach agreement, and it's not a problem to have an unreadable 32-page booklet listing all these rules and policies. 
So now the question is - since as you said the technology is already there - can we capitalize on that? 
If my bank already has a 32-page booklet with rules and regulations, can I just expose some of them as part of it's Web service definition?

Dear All, I have been following all the very interesting discussions and work going on in this group for sometime and if time permitted I would have joined. 
The reason I jump in here is that Im leading a effort within UN/CEFACT to look a agreements and contracts in a project called Unified Business Agreements and Contracts , UBAC for short. 
In UBAC we approach electronic collaborations from an agreement point of view, i.e. how do we make global business level agreements electronically interpretable and integrated with varous mechanisms for business collaborations / choreographies ? 
When reading Davids email I realized that we are touching the same problematic areas and It may be if interest to you to know that we exists and were working on the border of profiling business realtionships. 
I have attached a contribution from EDIFICE / RosettaNet / ESIA/EECA that shows a way to legally organize business relations. 
The UBAC project is also going to work with business level artifacts such as commitments, fulfillments of for example payment, delivery.
