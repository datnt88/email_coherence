<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> As I recall, you made this comment when you reviewed the spec.  </s>
<s> right before it was released.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure why it wasn't addressed then, but language to this effect will be added to the next draft.  </s>
<s> like:  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Hmm. Right now we use the link element in the source property, which is defined: Combined with the definition of link: This allows the source property to contain multiple links, each of which can have multiple sources and multiple destinations, as is shown in the example in Section 12.11.1.  </s>
<s> It seems that there is a slight advantage to keeping the definition of link singular (i.e., only one single link) since this way you can specify a property to only include a single link.  </s>
<s> If link was defined like: It would be impossible to specify only a single link without creating a new production.  </s>
<s> So, my inclination is to leave the specification as-is.  </s>
<s> Do you agree?  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> This one is moot.  </s>
<s> I think that i.e. is OK here, but the best solution is to rewrite the sentence so i.e. isn't needed.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Yes, you are right about the definition of link.  </s>
<s> Keep it the way it is.  </s>
<s> Jim/Judith, I am little bit confused with COPY, MOVE and DELETE operations.  </s>
<s> I have gone through the scenarios document, and protocol document.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> would appreciate if someone can explain to me how the following scenarios are handled using the current protocol spec.  </s>
<s> I am not trying to take whole group back to use case analysis stage, but, my objective here is to make sure  </s>
<s> that current protocol has all definitions and explanations to have a clean implementation.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, to overcome some  </s>
<s> of the limitation each implementor will choose their own way of interpretion and which lead to interoperability issues.  </s>
<s> Scenario A:Jane directs that the page P and all subordinate objects be  </s>
<s> deleted from the web W. Joe directs his web browser to retrieve page P from the web W.  </s>
<s> Issue here is: If deletion of page P and associated subordinate objects  </s>
<s> from the Web W takes sometime to process, then Joe requests this page and by that time  </s>
<s> some references to that page might have deleted already and hence joe sees broken links on  </s>
<s> page P. This throws an integrity issue.  </s>
<s> Or in other case, assume joe had already started editing  </s>
<s> this page P. Jane deleted this and when joe gets into publishing stage there is no matching  </s>
<s> properties associated with the same document.  </s>
<s> Scenario B: Jane directs that collection C be moved to collection D.  </s>
<s> While this move operation in progress.  </s>
<s> joe directs his editor to take a write(exclusive)  </s>
<s> lock on Collection D. This request will succeed as MOVE operation hasn't taken any explicit lock  </s>
<s> on Collection D. If this assumption is right, then, rest of the move operation will fail as  </s>
<s> EXCLUSIVE WRITE lock has acquired by joe on collection D and jane cannot be completed either server will be  </s>
<s> WAITING for lock release on collection D.  </s>
<s> I think, to make the spec more clearer, good add some more explanation on  </s>
<s> COPY, MOVE and DELETE methods, how locks are issued on source and target resources for these operations and  </s>
<s> impact of this on relevant methods.  </s>

<s> Maybe I am assuming too much, but if I was a user of a commercial-grade  </s>

<s> I  </s>
<s> would assume this without it being in the spec, as this has been standard practice in the relational DB world for a number of years, and this problem is nearly (maybe exactly) isomorphic to the "SQL DELETE on related tables" problem.  </s>
<s> (For a non-DBA, it seems like I've spent a lot of time on DB-related issues...) However, other users might make a different assumption.  </s>
<s> (For a freeware WebDAV system, it might be acceptable to let Joe look at a page with broken links while a deletion was in progress.  </s>
<s> One of the major strengths of Tim BL's approach to hypertext was breaking out of the Dexter hypertext model, where every link was guaranteed to work -- Dexter-based hypertext would never have worked over the Internet, which is never all working at the same time.)

<s> Perhaps this indicates the need for a sentence or two in the spec to explicitly call out this possibility for integrity violations.  </s>
<s> I acknowledge in advance the need for a balance between tutorial/cautionary material and straightforward exposition, but if this is a plausible misunderstanding then perhaps it is good to try a little harder to fend it off.  </s>

<s> There are at least two possible ways of handling this situation, and both are completely acceptable (intentionally so) according to the current language in the -06 spec.  </s>
<s> These two situations correspond to the two different types of servers in Mark Fisher's post (database and "freeware") a) ("freeware") The server happily returns page P to Joe, and page P may very well contain broken links.  </s>
<s> As both Jim Davis and Mark fisher have pointed out, the web is optimized for distribution and availability, so this choice is consistent with the design principles of the web.  </s>
<s> b) (database) A smarter web server might note that P's namespace is being deleted, and prevent accesses to this namespace while the operation is taking place.  </s>
<s> Again, both are legal.  </s>
<s> The advantage of this is that a DAV server implemented on a file system doesn't have to use an internal transaction manager, while a DAV server implemented on a database or a document management system can be much more intelligent by making use of its native capabilities.  </s>
<s> If Joe is editing page P without having first taken out a lock, then it is acceptable to Joe to have P change while he is editing it.  </s>
<s> If it is unacceptable to Joe that P change while he is editing it, then Joe must take out a write lock prior to starting his edit session.  </s>

<s> There are many cases here: 1) If Joe's lock on D is processed before Jane's MOVE operation, the MOVE will fail.  </s>
<s> 2) One server strategy is to pause operations on D while the MOVE was taking place.  </s>
<s> In this case, the MOVE would finish, then the lock operation would be performed.  </s>
<s> 3) Another strategy is to allow the operations to interleave, allowing the MOVE to start, and then, while the MOVE is underway, start performing the LOCK.  </s>
<s> Even if the MOVE does not MOVE all members of the source collection to the destination, the semantics of MOVE are such that a partial failure does not result in a rollback on failure, so it is OK to interleave without knowing the final outcome.  </s>
