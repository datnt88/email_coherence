<s> As promised at the last telecon, there's a new version of the Primer at  </s>
<s> This is ready for WG review as far as I'm concerned.  </s>
<s> The main thing it lacks that I'd meant to do (which I assume can be done either during review time or after last call) is links to definitions in Concepts and other documents (the terms are there, and mostly italicized; what needs to be done is turn them into links).  </s>
<s> I changed a bunch of figure numbers around (they were all messed up for various historic reasons), so there are a whole lot of figures that need to be moved along with the html file into CVS space (I assume Eric can do this?).  </s>
<s> Anyway, the manifest for the whole shebang is: rdf-primer-20021217.html fig1dec16.png  </s>

<s> NB: The rdf metadata file needs to be updated to identify the new version; I didn't get around to doing that either.  </s>

<s> Way to go Frank.  </s>
<s> I've uploaded this to along with all the figures.  </s>
<s> I had a problem with the figures.  </s>
<s> They appear to have been loaded into cvs as text files and when I check them out they are corrupt, so I had to download them individually from the web and load them into the new directory.  </s>
<s> Seems to have worked though :) Happy Holidays Brian  </s>

<s> This file doesn't validate Frank, but I expect you are now on holiday and we can fix this up in the new year.  </s>

<s> Thanks Brian.  </s>
<s> I'm on the road now (at a motel), so I'll have a look at the uploaded version when I have a better Internet connection.  </s>
<s> Regarding validation, yeah (Eric had taken care of the validation of the other versions, so I didn't do it for this one either, not to mention being in a bit of a rush).  </s>
<s> However, I *did* (this time) validate the RDF/XML examples (at least the ones that weren't using extensions, and provided namespaces), and found a few glitches (we might want to consider filling out some of those other examples so they validate too).  </s>
