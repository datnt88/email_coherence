As promised at the last telecon, there's a new version of the Primer at 
This is ready for WG review as far as I'm concerned. 
The main thing it lacks that I'd meant to do (which I assume can be done either during review time or after last call) is links to definitions in Concepts and other documents (the terms are there, and mostly italicized; what needs to be done is turn them into links). 
I changed a bunch of figure numbers around (they were all messed up for various historic reasons), so there are a whole lot of figures that need to be moved along with the html file into CVS space (I assume Eric can do this?). 
Anyway, the manifest for the whole shebang is: rdf-primer-20021217.html fig1dec16.png 
fig2dec16.png 
fig3dec16.png 
fig4dec16.png 
fig5dec16.png 
fig6dec16.png 
fig7dec16.png 
fig8dec16.png 
fig9dec16.png 
fig10dec16.png 
fig11dec16.png 
fig13dec16.png 
fig14dec16.png 
fig15dec16.png 
fig16dec16.png 
fig17dec16.png 
fig18dec16.gif fig19Adec16.gif fig19Bdec16.gif (the gap between fig11 and fig13 is deliberate). 
NB: The rdf metadata file needs to be updated to identify the new version; I didn't get around to doing that either. 
Regarding the following: I get a "multiple choice" and then an "access denied" when I try to reference --Frank snip

Way to go Frank. 
I've uploaded this to along with all the figures. 
I had a problem with the figures. 
They appear to have been loaded into cvs as text files and when I check them out they are corrupt, so I had to download them individually from the web and load them into the new directory. 
Seems to have worked though :) Happy Holidays Brian

This file doesn't validate Frank, but I expect you are now on holiday and we can fix this up in the new year.

Thanks Brian. 
I'm on the road now (at a motel), so I'll have a look at the uploaded version when I have a better Internet connection. 
Regarding validation, yeah (Eric had taken care of the validation of the other versions, so I didn't do it for this one either, not to mention being in a bit of a rush). 
However, I *did* (this time) validate the RDF/XML examples (at least the ones that weren't using extensions, and provided namespaces), and found a few glitches (we might want to consider filling out some of those other examples so they validate too).
