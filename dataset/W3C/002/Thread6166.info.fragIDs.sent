PFTF'ers: I'm having trouble connecting to Longfellow - are others having problems?

I got in 617 252-1038. 
There are only a couple of us on. 
Gah - I'm getting random beeps and no connection at that number, repeatedly. 
Grrr. 
I think I may need to tender regrets myself! 
:( I'll try for a few more mins - please feel free to continue the discussion without me or we can just try again next week with more of a full crew.

Given that I'm kind of unconnected for the moment and far away, I don't know what happen. 
Apologies for this trouble again. 
Things don't work right by themselves if you're not around.

Apparently Colleen, Paco, and Steve made it on - I don't know if my problem was the bridge or the hotel phone system.... 
In any case, they punted after a little while and we'll try again next week.
