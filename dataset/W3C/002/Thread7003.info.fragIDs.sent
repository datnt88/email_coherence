<s> [This has mainly to do with keeping an administrative track of what tags one uses, and is therefore more of an implementation and usage matter than a syntax issue.  </s>
<s> N.B.  </s>
<s> I would not have much of a problem with any of this, but you can see that the W3C or some large organization would have to be very careful indeed in its tag policies.]  </s>
<s> The main question that I want to address in this email is, "could/should one mint a tag for an event occurring on e.g. 1-3-8 on 1-3-18?".  </s>
<s> This all stems from one of the most interesting aspects of the "tag:" delegation, which is its dependence upon the notion of "tag time", i.e. one particular day on or after 1st January 2001.  </s>
<s> This raises the  </s>
<s> question: how specific is this particular unit of time given the resources that it is binded to?  </s>
<s> For example, I had always considered the date-stamping of URIs as popularized by the W3C to simply mean "what on 2001/03 we referred to as EARL" for /2001/03/earl/ (this is supported by a quote from "Cool URIs Don't Change" [1]).  </s>
<s> That is until I saw the TANN URI proposal [2], which states:- An example: W3C obtained "w3.org" on 1994-07-06.  </s>
<s> Had this TANN scheme been in place, W3C might have used "tann:1994-07-06,w3.org," for the first few weeks.  </s>
<s> If it wanted, come August 1 it could switch to "tann:1994-07,w3.org,".  </s>
<s> Come Jan 1, it could switch to "tann:1995,w3.org," which would be a good name to use until some problem arose.  </s>
<s> If in July of 2000 (say), it realized a wholely new organization and policy was needed, it could start using "tann:2000,w3.org,".  </s>
<s> Also, if some need arose for a temporary namespace, an arbitrary narrow time could be used, like "tann:2000-01-01-00-00-00.00001,w3.org,".  </s>
<s> (This is probably best avoided by using sensable namespace policies.)  </s>
<s> This implies that the shorter the time period, the more whimsical the resource being identified.  </s>
<s> It also implies that long time periods are very broad, and should have distinct namespace policies.  </s>
<s> In other words, "1" would be something which is used "until some problem arises".  </s>
<s> However, this seems to go against the flow that each date component in a tag identifies a particular *day* and not a longer period of time.  </s>
<s> This appears to be something that has changed in the transition from tann = tag, and yet some of the semantics of tann are being alluded to, i.e. that the more general the resource, the shorter the date component in the tag.  </s>
<s> Thus, although the first day of a particular day is still just a day, it could be envisaged as having some kind of special meaning in that it is a very general identifier that has a certain namespace policy, whereas three part date components are for more pointed identifications.  </s>
<s> As a practical example, earlier today, I looked out of my window onto the lawn outside to see a blackbird hopping around... let's mint a tag to identify that particular blackbird:- tag://sean@mysterylights.com;1-4-28/blackbird  </s>
<s> Now, the only reason that I should ever want to reuse that URI is if I saw possibly another blackbird on the same day, or if I wanted to issue some other remark about a blackbird.  </s>
<s> However, due to persistence, that URI is now bonded to that particular resource, so what would I use to represent another blackbird?  </s>
<s> What if I want to refer to the concept of the blackbird in the 1-4-28 tag in a different context; would I use the date where I create that new context?  </s>
<s> One idea would be to use the date of something in that path itself (e.g. tag://sean@mysterylights.com;1-4-28/2001-4-10/myconcept) which identifies the "myconcept" on that particular date, but that goes against the flow of having a dating system for the authority component in the first place.  </s>
<s> However, in some cases (e.g. for dates before 2001) this would probably be necessary.  </s>
<s> Still, the general rule still holds true that, "concepts that one rarely refer to should have the three tier part, whereas the broader concepts get the 1sts".  </s>
<s> One problem with using "1" as a very generic namespace is that if I want to create a very whimsical term on that date, I have to be wary of the policy for using "1" which I will no doubt want to use again.  </s>
<s> In this case, you could just prepend a "1" to the path or something; no big deal.  </s>
<s> In other words, there is a big difference between "The Simpsons" and "the episode of Simpsons I watched on a particular day".  </s>
<s> In actual fact, I think that unless this is some *really* important namespace, reusing the 1st of January namespace is a bit lazy; simply not wanting to type a few extra digits.  </s>
<s> Why not use a slightly more specific URI if it clears up the confusion?  </s>
<s> Still, there are some advantages to using the date part as put out in the TANN proposal: i.e. that tags could then point to any kind of concept: from those well thought out (using shorter date components) to those which are thought up quickly, and may only apply for a short time period.  </s>
<s> For example, I am always creating concepts and so on that I use in emails (hey, I'm an SW developer)...  </s>
<s> I don't want to have to keep track of all of these for any longer than a day, so I can just use the three-tier date component for them, knowing that I'll get 353 of them a year, and will not have not reuse these at some point in the future.  </s>
<s> If I want a structured namespace that I can use in a project or something, I can use a "first of the month" or possibly "first of the year" tag.  </s>
<s> Also, I guess it would be legal to use subdomains at ones domain name?  </s>
<s> e.g. tag://sbp.infomesh.net;1/myterm  </s>
<s> This is not something that could be particularly constrained by the specification for tags itself, because it is fully up to the user how they manage their own tag space, but I do think it would be sensible to advise people on the best practices in managing their namespaces.  </s>
<s> Certainly, date stamping, and using URIs to identify abstract resource in general is an very difficult concept for some people to grasp, especially those that only know about HTTP URLs, and look upon them as simply locations for some data.  </s>
<s> Another part of this problem is related the difference between 2x3 and 3x2; they are different strings, but they both have the same answer mathematically.  </s>
<s> If I was referring to this sum as a mathematical expression, would I use "/math/2x3" or "/math/3x2"?  </s>
<s> I conclude that it doesn't matter as long as one refers to the same namespace consistently, or states an equivalence in a particular implementation.  </s>
<s> P.S. Sorry about the "rant" nature of this email (which reminds me a little of [3]), but it is an important topic.  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI states:- 1998/pics can be taken to mean for your server "what we meant in 1998 by pics", rather than "what in 1998 we did with what we now refer to as pics."

<s> :Sean :hasHomepage http://purl.org/net/sbp/ .  </s>
<s> I really think tag is a good idea (though I'd appreciate a more unique name, as Sean does) and something that's very much needed.  </s>
<s> But there have been two issues about the tag spec that have bothered me:  </s>
<s> 1) Why does tag insist on using such strange dates?  </s>
<s> It seems that the magic date 2001-1-1 will cause confusion and misuse of tags.  </s>
<s> Certainly it confused me for a bit.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't it be simpler just to specify full dates as in the original proposal -- I think this would make more sense and be more compatible.  </s>
<s> You seem to indicate that the shortness rule is because you need to encode these in barcodes.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems unlikely that the few extra characters needed will make that much of a difference.  </s>
<s> And even if they do, can't you put this in the barcode encoding/decoding mechanism, and not bother the users with it?  </s>
<s> 2) Similarly, the rule that you can mint tags on dates before you've "owned" the domain just seems silly.  </s>
<s> There is no technical reason for this, it just seems like an exception so that people can use the magic date mentioned above.  </s>
<s> People are highly unlikely to do diligent research on past domains, and thus will probably accidentally run into conflicts.  </s>
<s> Since the scheme can make a simple change to prevent this, I think it should.  </s>
<s> Overall, I think the tag scheme should be simple.  </s>
<s> This will insure that it will be understood and used properly.  </s>

<s> Hi Aaron, I wanted to respond to your posting about bicycles but that'll have to wait 'cause I'm about to go to a conference for a few days.  </s>
<s> But I think I have time for a reasonably sensible response to this one:  </s>
<s> As has been said during this discussion, it'll be software that produces tags by-and-large, so I'm not too worried about mistakes.  </s>
<s> I'm more concerned about practices (see my response to your next point).  </s>
<s> The date is almost always used opaquely: as I'm sure you appreciate, its role is to make the tag unique and it's not a timestamp of any resource.  </s>
<s> So I'm less concerned as to whether it can be construed very easily as opposed to moderately easily, and more concerned about brevity.  </s>
<s> Of course, brevity can be undone by long specific identifiers (not to mention long domain names) but I'd like to try to make brevity possible.  </s>
<s> The majority of tags will contain very short date strings like ";1" and ";2-3", thus making them that bit easier for humans to write and say to one another.  </s>
<s> Aesthetically, I just like the way that that those short strings are unobtrusive.  </s>
<s> (I'm settling down to the idea of seeing a ';' in there but 'semi-colon' isn't very nice to say as compared to 'dot', 'dash' etc. 'Comma' would be phonetically nicer.) I used the term 'tag' because literal tagging of physical entities is my original motivation.  </s>
<s> Linear barcode symbologies (like some other id technologies) aren't very forgiving when it comes to length.  </s>
<s> Yes, I could have special conventions for writing tags into barcode form, which would be converted into canonical tag form.  </s>
<s> But then we have things floating around that sort of are tags and sort of aren't.  </s>
<s> We went through a process of allowing multiple forms for tags but Sandro persuaded me not to and now I'm a true convert to that idea.  </s>
<s> I think you (and several others) are right that our motivations are less than convincing.  </s>
<s> In our defence, it's not that we specifically want to make it possible for just about everyone to use ";1" but that we think people would be sorely tempted to do that and we wanted to see if there was a valid way for that to be done.  </s>
<s> I'm tempted to remove the use of unassigned authority names from the proposal.  </s>
<s> I also think we should consider removing the parts about putting hints in the specific identifiers, and how those who mint tags can declare their true identities (by using an appropriate authority name).  </s>
<s> It seems to have created more trouble than it was worth to make that explicit.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Yes but I think the '/' in the tag authority is (was) the really confusing bit.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback.  </s>
