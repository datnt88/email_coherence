<s> This brief answer is in reference to the question asked by Larry.  </s>
<s> In our system we factor the following services: a) Delta based version storage b) Version management c) Meta object d) Configuration management, and e) Workspace management The key in (a) is an ability to identify deltas by name and to associate some meta date to the delta (in order to properly support merge).  </s>
<s> (b) essentially becomes name management.  </s>
<s> Meta objects in our case is more than the attribute/value pair or links pointing to large documents.  </s>
<s> We use a multiple-inheritance based object model (particularly useful in Product Data Management).  </s>
<s> Configurations are snapshots that contain many versioned objects and configuration management has to deal with serving up configurations as versionable objects.  </s>
<s> Finally, workspace management has to deal with creating a "place" in which users prepare and committ many long term transactions (i.e., in this case configurations).  </s>
<s> Workspaces have a notion of views and there is a view service provided.  </s>
<s> Again, in our implementation, each of these services can be separated across different servers.  </s>
<s> We believe that the above approach can lead to very large scaling of a DAV system.  </s>
<s> I can't tell if these considerations have gone into the design of the current protocol.  </s>

<s> I think most people are aware of the considerations, but might have a different model for what the scaling issues are.  </s>
<s> The general principle for scaling in DAV is that every object that can be manipulated independently is a resource, and has its own URL.  </s>
<s> The relationship between resources is always determined by operations on (one of) the related resources, rather than, say, by string manipulation of the URLs.  </s>
<s> (The only exception to this is the possible relationship of a 'realm' to a partial URL string, in the same way that HTTP authentication and cookies are tied to realms.) Because resources are linked by URLs, resources need not reside on the same physical machine.  </s>
<s> At least, that was the general idea.  </s>
<s> It's up to you to evaluate whether the design and its elaboration meets your needs.  </s>
<s> By stoping at the "resource" boundry and also by not separating the services offered by a DAV system we are not scaling the DAV system itself.  </s>
<s> Here are some examples.  </s>
<s> In existing version control systems the management of delta is done in atleast four ways that I know of - full copies, forward deltas, reverse deltas, and change sets.  </s>
<s> Each of these are appropriate for different types of media and different applications.  </s>
<s> If we pull this service out as a separate piece, then we can plug and play different "storage management" services for different applications and we can allow users to mix and match them too.  </s>
<s> Similarly configurations and versions are intimately related and another server can be used to manage these two together.  </s>
<s> This is already done by commercial companies today.  </s>
<s> In fact, placing the name management functionality in different places in the client-server pipe (i.e., client, group proxy, server) limits/makes-possible different types of configuration serving.  </s>
<s> etc., etc.  </s>
<s> This is why I wondered if a service model had been developed.  </s>

<s> Since we're talking at the abstract layer, it's easy to generate misunderstanding.  </s>
<s> A "resource" is in fact a service; an object, if you will.  </s>
<s> (I'd disagree with the post that we're not adopting an "object-oriented" framework; I think the 'web' is object-oriented in that resources are the objects, URLs are object pointers, although web resources normally only offer methods of GET, PUT and POST, although we're considering additional resource-based methods; insofar as we add additional methods, it ties the delivery of services to those transports that offer additional methods.) We've noted, for example, that the resource of "the source" is a different resource from "the generated content", with a link relationship of derived-from.  </s>
<s> So you can 'get the source' by applying the GET method to the source instead of applying it to the derived content, e.g., for web pages with server-side includes.  </s>
<s> However, with this choice, we're also allowing the source and the generated content to be on separate machines.  </s>
<s> Scalability and distribution are good properties in the abstract, but in practice, it's possible to carry the abstract goal farther than necessary, while at the same time, burdening the implementations with too many levels of indirection.  </s>
<s> So we need to carefully balance the separation of objects against actual practical needs.  </s>
<s> The main "scalable" case I'd like to argue for, for DAV (and perhaps this is a request to add something to the requirements document) is that it should be possible to do authoring against a completely separate machine than the machine(s) that are actually serving the content being authored.  </s>
<s> I'm imagining for security &amp; firewall considerations, as well as for load distribution, that one might want to have a separate server which handles all authenticated operations of update, but that, as far as the user and client are concerned, they *start* with the web server.  </s>
<s> That is, if you have "davserver.host.dom" and "www.host.dom",  </s>
<s> you might find that the URLs for the version tree, the source of documents, etc., are all "http://davserver.host.dom", even though the documents that you're actually authoring are "www.host.dom".  </s>
<s> It should be possible to not have to authenticate against the machine that is actually serving the documents.  </s>
<s> Your scenarios are interesting; the question is whether a standard should dictate a service model, or just allow a wide variety of service models.  </s>
<s> Although any product architecture needs a service model, we're clearly trying to support "all of them".  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should instead try to focus on just documenting the service models of the products that we're trying to support.  </s>
