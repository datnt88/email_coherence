<s> I have some difficulty with this.  </s>
<s> It is perfectly legitimate to include more than one of the first triplet (Issuer+Serial, SKI, and Subject).  </s>
<s> In fact, it is both normal and advisable to include Subject and SKI together.  </s>
<s> X509CRL, when found by itself, does not specify a certificate at all - so it makes sense with either Issuer+Serial or Certificate.  </s>

<s> Any of the first three triplet can be included, but only one of each.  </s>
<s> The CRL issue is interesting though.  </s>
<s> I have to admit that I have not thought about the best way to include the CRL.  </s>
<s> However, I do think that the other parts of the element declaration below make sense... --Kevin  </s>
