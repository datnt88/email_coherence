<s> Whilst I am trying to clean up a some files, a couple of questions have arisen.  </s>
<s> 1. How can I use the Win32 version to clean a batch of files in a directory and sub directories, I cannot find any info on the command line instructions anywhere.  </s>
<s> 2. Is there a tidy setting to strip out blank lines?  </s>
<s> If there isn't one what do I need to do to put this on the wish list?  </s>
<s> I know I can deal with the above when I get around to writing my own tidylib wrapper, but my priority at the moment is to tidy up this current load of documents.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>

<s> RTFM.  </s>
<s> There is scads of docs on the command line tool on the project page.  </s>
<s> See:  </s>
<s> It'll take you 5 minutes to get the gist of it.  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
<s> % for /R %a in (*.html) do tidy "%a" Type `for /?` on the command line for more information.  </s>
<s> Tidy doesn't support this at the moment.  </s>
<s> I'd recommend using a post processor, e.g. Perl like % tidy example.html  </s>
<s> | perl -ne "print if /\S/"  </s>
<s> Hi Charles,  </s>
<s> OK when I first looked, all I found were docs on the using the API.  </s>
<s> I have now found the right docs, but have hit a couple of problems.  </s>
<s> I have created a config file (with the help of your UI) as follows:- indent-spaces: 0 wrap: 0 write-back: yes indent: auto output-html: yes logical-emphasis: yes drop-proprietary-attributes: yes drop-font-tags: yes wrap-sections: no wrap-asp: no wrap-jste: no wrap-php: no enclose-text: yes enclose-block-text: yes word-2000: yes tidy-mark: no I ran several test using your UI and it was doing roughly what I wanted, however I then tried running the latest win32 build using the following command line:- c:\tools\tidy\tidy.exe  </s>
<s> -config c:\tools\tidy\InitialCleanUp.tidy -m filename.htm  </s>
<s> -f errs.txt and it produced an error.. Fatal Error: Panic - tree has lost it's integrity Also, now your UI no longer works.  </s>
<s> Any ideas why this would have happened.  </s>
<s> Also a pointer towards doing a batch convert would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help so far.  </s>

<s> Hi Bjoern, Thanks for the response.  </s>
<s> OK, you have completely lost me now.  </s>
<s> I tried the command line (tidy.exe for /?), But it didn't work.  </s>
<s> I am using the 27 February, 2003 for Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP Where do I go from here.  </s>

<s> `for` is part of your shell, most likely `command.com`,  </s>
<s> `command.exe`  </s>
<s> or `cmd.exe` depending on your Windows version.  </s>
<s> Let's try it this way: C:\Windows\ for /? Tidy is not involved.  </s>
<s> Also try: tidy -? tidy -help-config  </s>
<s> Hi Bjoern,  </s>
<s> OK, now I know what you are talking about, I was getting a bit lost there.  </s>
<s> I have cobbled together a batch file as follows:- FOR /R %%a IN (*.htm) do c:\tools\tidy\tidy.exe  </s>
<s> -config c: \tools\tidy\InitialCleanUp.tidy -m "%%a" -f errs.txt  </s>
<s> This cleans one document and then seems to stop.  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker The Virtual World (UK) Limited Cirencester, United Kingdom  </s>
<s> Try: FOR /R %%a IN (*.htm) do call tidy  </s>
