Whilst I am trying to clean up a some files, a couple of questions have arisen. 
1. How can I use the Win32 version to clean a batch of files in a directory and sub directories, I cannot find any info on the command line instructions anywhere. 
2. Is there a tidy setting to strip out blank lines? 
If there isn't one what do I need to do to put this on the wish list? 
I know I can deal with the above when I get around to writing my own tidylib wrapper, but my priority at the moment is to tidy up this current load of documents. 
Thanks in advance.

RTFM. 
There is scads of docs on the command line tool on the project page. 
See: 
It'll take you 5 minutes to get the gist of it. 
take it easy, Charlie 
% for /R %a in (*.html) do tidy "%a" Type `for /?` on the command line for more information. 
Tidy doesn't support this at the moment. 
I'd recommend using a post processor, e.g. Perl like % tidy example.html 
| perl -ne "print if /\S/" 
Hi Charles, 
OK when I first looked, all I found were docs on the using the API. 
I have now found the right docs, but have hit a couple of problems. 
I have created a config file (with the help of your UI) as follows:- indent-spaces: 0 wrap: 0 write-back: yes indent: auto output-html: yes logical-emphasis: yes drop-proprietary-attributes: yes drop-font-tags: yes wrap-sections: no wrap-asp: no wrap-jste: no wrap-php: no enclose-text: yes enclose-block-text: yes word-2000: yes tidy-mark: no I ran several test using your UI and it was doing roughly what I wanted, however I then tried running the latest win32 build using the following command line:- c:\tools\tidy\tidy.exe 
-config c:\tools\tidy\InitialCleanUp.tidy -m filename.htm 
-f errs.txt and it produced an error.. Fatal Error: Panic - tree has lost it's integrity Also, now your UI no longer works. 
Any ideas why this would have happened. 
Also a pointer towards doing a batch convert would be appreciated. 
Thanks for all the help so far.

Hi Bjoern, Thanks for the response. 
OK, you have completely lost me now. 
I tried the command line (tidy.exe for /?), But it didn't work. 
I am using the 27 February, 2003 for Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP Where do I go from here.

`for` is part of your shell, most likely `command.com`, 
`command.exe` 
or `cmd.exe` depending on your Windows version. 
Let's try it this way: C:\Windows\ for /? Tidy is not involved. 
Also try: tidy -? tidy -help-config 
Hi Bjoern, 
OK, now I know what you are talking about, I was getting a bit lost there. 
I have cobbled together a batch file as follows:- FOR /R %%a IN (*.htm) do c:\tools\tidy\tidy.exe 
-config c: \tools\tidy\InitialCleanUp.tidy -m "%%a" -f errs.txt 
This cleans one document and then seems to stop. 
Any ideas?

Try: FOR /R %%a IN (*.htm) do call tidy
