<s> I have been using Tidy for some time but keep having to fix a recurrent bug result: I have the output set to XHTML, but Tidy invariably alters "&amp;amp;" to "&amp;mp;".  </s>
<s> I have gone through and manually changed every single preference that Tidy offers to no avail.  </s>
<s> This sounds like an old bug that was fixed quite a while ago.  </s>
<s> What version of Tidy are using?  </s>
<s> The current version is dated 4 August 2000.  </s>

<s> Any reply to this?  </s>
<s> May we assume that this is fixed?  </s>
