<s> I think the best way to way to use variants is to limit one's use of variants to being a mechanically generated rendition of some other preexisting variant of the document.  </s>
<s> For example, the original document might be a word processing document.  </s>
<s> Another variant of it could be a postscript rendition of the document.  </s>
<s> For an image, a second variant could be a postage stamp version of the image, or a PDF version of the image.  </s>
<s> I don't think that a hand translated version of a document should normally be stored as a variant.  </s>
<s> I think that in general the best thing to do is to store hand translated versions as separate documents:  </s>
<s> Consider the properties of the document.  </s>
<s> Properties like title, author, and keywords are generally string properties that should be translated along with the content when the document is hand translated.  </s>
<s> Often, the character set should be different in the translated version as well.  </s>
<s> For example, let's say you have an English document in ASCII and you translate it to Japanese using an Asian character set.  </s>
<s> People fluent in multiple languages are relatively rare.  </s>
<s> Most of us have one language we prefer to operate in, so if you are a system administrator designing the schema for a document collection, you should accommodate that case well.  </s>
<s> Therefore, you want to design the schema such that English speakers can find the English version of the document by its title, author, and keywords in English in ASCII, and a Japanese speaker can find the document by those attributes in Japanese in an Asian character set.  </s>
<s> This means you need an English title attribute for the document and a Japanese title attribute for the document if you store the hand translated version of the document as just a variant of the original document.  </s>
<s> But that approach doesn't scale.  </s>
<s> Suppose you could potentially also have a French, Norwegian, German, or "any language on Earth" translation of the document?  </s>
<s> Having an English_title, a Japanese_title, a French_title, etc. for the document is an approach that is not very appealing and clearly doesn't scale well.  </s>
<s> (For example, if you stored the properties in certain RDBMS's, if you had a title, author, and keywords attribute defined for every language on Earth, you would exceed the maximum number of columns allowed for a table.)  </s>
<s> The leading alternative is to simply have one title attribute, e.g., Title, and store each translation of the document as a separate document.  </s>
<s> Each separate version of the document would have the title in the appropriate language in the appropriate character set.  </s>
<s> Then, all users could query the Title attribute in their preferred language in their preferred character set.  </s>
<s> (Let's assume that the collection uses UCS or Unicode as the underlying character set, so that it can deal with virtually any character set in a uniform manner).  </s>
<s> Then everyone's query would find a copy of the document they can read, if one exists.  </s>
<s> (Of course, associating hand translated versions of a document with each other is often desirable, but doing that is a separate issue.  </s>
<s> Multiple alternatives exist.) So, I think we should refrain from using hand translations of documents as an example of variants, because, while we can't prevent people from storing hand translations as variants, I feel that would be encouraging bad practice.  </s>
<s> I think we should use better chosen examples, based on mechanically generated renditions, and design for that case.  </s>
<s> Alan Babich  </s>
<s> The current versioning &amp; variants proposal stores every version/variant as a separate resource, meaning that each one can have totally separate properties.  </s>
<s> Doesn't that solve your problem?  </s>
<s> Hand translated variants can be extremely important; without them (or some ad hoc mechanism to do the same thing), there's no way to publish a document in multiple languages without requiring the user to pick one manually.  </s>

<s> It's unclear to me to what degree Alan's later post in this thread ("Yes.")  </s>
<s> reflects a retractment of this position, so let me add my voice to John Stracke's in saying that in my view WebDAV has a strong requirement to provide authoring support for both human and mechanically generated variants.  </s>
<s> The Web provides retrieval functionality for variants, and our authoring support should allow most common variant cases to be remotely authored.  </s>
<s> But, I sense that there may have been a terminology mix-up between Web and Document Management use of the terms variant, document, and resource, which seems to have been resolved, so I won't beat this issue any further.  </s>
