<s> Just wanted to pass along some Mozilla information I heard last week.  </s>
<s> Turns out that, at present, no one on the Mozilla team is working on integrating WebDAV functionality, a definite bummer.  </s>
<s> But, it appears that now would be a very good time for volunteers to join the Mozilla team and implement DAV, since the Mozilla editor is currently being re-built, and it would presumably be fairly easy to add WebDAV support in during this rebuild process.  </s>

<s> (But as I am mostly into Python and my time is quite limited I cannot do that.  </s>
<s> But maybe one day I will port it to Python and write the DAV FS with this.. But we will see :)  </s>
<s> At least it would make sense to have a look at it and tell them where some hooks should be added to do it later, etc. Usually they're quite open (as far as I experienced..) regards, Christian  </s>
<s> Take a look at DAV4J on http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com.  </s>
<s> It presents a client API for accessing WebDAV resources that would make building clients much easier.  </s>

<s> No. Why would you want to bloat the OS with something that most processes don't need?  </s>
<s> Now, a common library that apps can use easily, that'd be different; but it certainly doesn't belong in the kernel.  </s>

<s> IMHO, WebDAV definitely has its place in a filesystem implementation.  </s>
<s> It'd be convenient, but think about the security problems: given existing HTTP authentication protocols, the filesystem code would have to have the cleartext password of each user.  </s>

<s> As for the secure authentication, that is an issue that has to be dealt with for WebDAV (and HTTP in general) anyway.  </s>
<s> Yes, but the point is that any acceptably strong authentication system is going to involve credentials that can't be reused.  </s>
<s> (E.g., if I'm running through a proxy, then the proxy can steal my credentials if I use Basic authentication, but not if I use Digest.) This is more or less OK if only your browser has the credentials; but, if you want to do a filesystem, it's going to need access to all the credentials of all the users who want to use it.  </s>
<s> (For example, with Samba, if I want a filesystem to be mounted at startup, I have to put the password into the appropriate /etc/rc.d  </s>
<s> script.) |John Stracke | My opinions are my own | S/MIME &amp; HTML OK | |francis@ecal.com|============================================| |Chief Scientist | NT's lack of reliability is only surpassed | |eCal Corp. | by its lack of scalability.  </s>

<s> Here's one idea at least But I don't think he's been looking at this for quite a while.  </s>
<s> This approach seems to have occurred to several people.  </s>
<s> There was a paper in the 1997 Usenix Annual Technical Conference titled: "Extending the Operating System at the User level: the Ufo Global File System" Albert D. Alexandrov, Maximilian Ibel, Klaus E. Schauser, Chris J. Scheiman pages 77-90 "Ufo is a global file system.  </s>
<s> It allows users to treat remote files exactly as if they were local.  </s>
<s> Currently, Ufo supports file access through the FTP and HTTP protocols and allows new protocols to be plugged in.  </s>
<s> Ufo is implemented entirely at the user level using the Catcher.  </s>
<s> The Catcher is our tool for extending the functionality of standard UNIX operating systems completely at the user level.  </s>
<s> It works by intercepting selected system calls at the user level, using the existing /proc interface."  </s>
<s> I contacted them about a year ago, and told them about DAV.  </s>
<s> They mentioned that the project was no longer active, but that source code was available if someone was interested in picking it up and extending it.  </s>
<s> Their approach may be Solaris-specific.  </s>
<s> I did download their binary executable and ran it on a Solaris machine, and it worked pretty well.  </s>
<s> It was kinda neat being able to do an "ls" of the Internet-Drafts directory (and very useful to be able to use the ls wildcards to only find specific I-Ds).  </s>
<s> Of course, this approach highlighted for me why you want to have both tool integration and OS support.  </s>
<s> For example, if using Ufo (i.e., using only an OS integration) I wanted to do a grep of the I-D directory, it would be a really long operation, where every I-D would be locally downloaded, then searched.  </s>
<s> If, however, grep knew about DASL, it could then turn its request into a DASL query, which would execute much faster.  </s>
<s> It seems to me the advantage of OS integration is compatibility will all existing file-based tools, at the cost of some operations taking longer than the same operation performed by a tool that was tightly integrated with DAV, and hence could take advantage of DAV features to perform the operation in the most efficient way.  </s>
<s> So, I see advantages to both approaches, with the tight integration into every tool being the best possible choice.  </s>
<s> But, since this is going to take a while to occur, OS-level integration gives a good level of compatibility for the interim as tools add DAV support.  </s>
