<s> Hi Phill,  </s>
<s> When we considered how to partition our namespace for algorithm and structure purposes, we had two options: [a] http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#foo [b] http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig/foo RDF had already made significant use of "#foo" and this approach makes it much easier to maintain all the URIs with respect to dereferencing in that I don't need a directory, instead, the namespace URI is redirected to the latest version of the spec for which there are actual fragments explaining/corresponding to that URI.  </s>

<s> I don't think there is a problem with the "#foo" URIs.  </s>
<s> The problem is with the toplevel "#", should it be treated like a trailing slash and ignored or is it significant?  </s>
<s> It is like my refusal to administer UNIX systems.  </s>
<s> I have no difficulty using or administering the system myself but I want to minimize the number of queries I get from people who are having problems and think that I might be able to help.  </s>
