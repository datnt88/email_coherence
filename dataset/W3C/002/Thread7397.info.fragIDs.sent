<s> You are correct, each versioned component in the hierarchy path will have to resolve its revision.  </s>
<s> This will require both a branch label and version label because we support multiple lines of descent, and it may be impossible or undesirable to require unique lables across branches (they may not all be available at any given point in time).  </s>

<s> Let's do the easy one first: why do you need versioned collections?  </s>
<s> (Saying why you need something is always easier than saying how you will make it work :-).  </s>
<s> If you make a (non-collection) resource revision immutable, one of the things you freeze is any references it contains to other resources.  </s>
<s> Those references will be invalid if you don't save the "state" of the namespace that the containing collections provide.  </s>
<s> This makes versioned collections essential for any application that wants to version a resource whose semantics depend on other resources that it "contains" or "refers to" (such as a book made up of chapter resources, or source code that includes header resources.  </s>
<s> I believe though that the solution is reasonably straightforward, namely, that you use the same branching/labeling conventions for your collection resources that use for your non-collection resources, and then use a consistent rule/convention when selecting both the collection and all its members.  </s>
<s> This is one of the reasons why I believe the VPortal mechanism (which selects a revision from just a single versioned resource) will not prove to be very useful, while the dynamic configuration mechanism (which provides a mechanism for consistently selecting revisions from an entire collection) will be both necessary and sufficient.  </s>

<s> But isn't that what configuration management is for?  </s>
<s> Traditionally, "configuration management" includes: - artifact indentification - change tracking - version selection and baselining - software manufacture (building derived files) - managing concurrent update Some of these are clearly concerns of WebDAV (e.g. managing concurrent update), and others are clearly not (e.g. software manufacture), and others fall in the middle somewhere.  </s>
<s> Given the prevalence and importance of Web resources that refer to other Web resources, maintaining the validity of those references under versioning does seems like an essential aspect of WebDAV (and the CM vendors have pretty standard approaches that are reasonably straightforward to apply).  </s>
