Hi, 
The XHTML link on the main page is to http://www.w3.org/MarkUp and my browser (IE 6 SP1) wonders if I want to download the file MarkUp.

This is almost certainly because your browser is telling the W3C site that it accepts XHTML by sending application/xhtml+xml in the Accept: header. 
If you have installed XML Spy that would explain it, since it incorrectly causes this to be added to the IE accept: head; but there may be other reasons.

In other words: 1. Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe) 2. Check [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Accepted Documents] to see if 'application/xhtml+xml' got added 3. If it's there, delete it 4. Quit Registry Editor and restart IE Then you should be able to access http://www.w3.org/MarkUp with IE, i.e. it gets 'text/html'. 
IE doesn't support the 'application/xhtml+xml' media type yet. 
If the above process didn't fix your problem, please let me know.

Thank you Steven and Masayasu, this has fixed my problem. 
I do have XML Spy, along with other XML/XSLT tools installed. 
Thanks again, Bruce Krautbauer
