<s> I am currently evaluating Ultraedit and noticed the TIDY that came with it.  </s>
<s> I tried it against a simple Micrsoft word 2002 "save as html" file and got lots of errors.  </s>
<s> This is just a headup notice on the chance that you have not tried it against miscrosoft generated code.  </s>

<s> Hi Erwin, Turns out Microsoft Word produces html that is sub-standard, very sub-standard in many ways.  </s>
<s> But there are some configurable options in Tidy that may help you out, take a look at these.  </s>
<s> Word-2000 http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#word-2000  </s>
<s> force-output http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#force-output  </s>
<s> bare http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#bare  </s>
<s> Also look at Microsofts own cleaning app I have been working on a custom app to convert Word output to XHTML and learning alot about what it takes to clean up the junk and leave behind useful info.  </s>
<s> Cheers  </s>

<s> Erwin - to utilize the power of Tidy against the putrid HTML(if you can call it that) of Word.  </s>
<s> You have to use a config file in association with Tidy.  </s>
<s> I am about 95% successful in cleaning it up with a config file that looks like this: word-2000: yes new-empty-tags: o, head literal-attributes: no indent: auto indent-spaces: 2 tidy-mark: no wrap: 72 markup: yes output-xml: no input-xml: no doctype: omit show-warnings: yes numeric-entities: yes uppercase-tags: no uppercase-attributes: no char-encoding: latin1 clean: yes quote-marks: yes quote-nbsp: yes quote-ampersand: yes break-before-br: no drop-empty-paras: yes drop-font-tags: yes enclose-text: yes write-back: yes new-empty-tags: o, style, head markup: yes error-file: err.txt  </s>
<s> The only thing that I have found that this will not do is to remove the "smart-tags" that windowsXP puts in there (I assume this is because the word-2000 option was written befor ethe marvelous invention of these dumb smart-tags).  </s>
<s> Also, my config file removes the " head " tags and everything between them.  </s>
<s> In addition, if you end up downloading the Microsoft clean up tool, it is ok, but is 100% incompatible with office XP, and will not install on anything other than office2000.  </s>
<s> However, you can extract a file called "filter.exe" from the install files and use it in the command line.  </s>
<s> I am anxious to try the "force-output bare" option myself.  </s>
<s> If you have trouble getting the filter.exe  </s>
<s> file, let me know and i can email it to you.  </s>
<s> peace, dude in oregon  </s>
