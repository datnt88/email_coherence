<s> To Whom It May Concern,  </s>
<s> I just wanted to let you know that the downloadable spec for HTML 4.01 (PDF Version) has an incorrect file extension and link.  </s>
<s> It is not gzipped.  </s>
<s> Just remove the gz extension, making it a PDF file and change the appropriate link.  </s>
<s> It is in fact, a PDF file.  </s>

<s> I believe that the links and gzipping are correct, and that your client is unzipping the document on the fly.  </s>
