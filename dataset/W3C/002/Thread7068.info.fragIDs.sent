<s> The IETF Internet Draft Basic Network Media Services with SIP, http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-burger-sipping-netann-08.txt, amongst other things establishes a URI convention for addressing named resources at an automaton (in this case, a media server).  </s>
<s> Input is solicited on the use and applicability of a URI convention in the sip: and sips: URI scheme.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your consideration.  </s>
<s> Hi Eric!  </s>
<s> I didn't notice the change as SIP was being developed, but somewhere along  </s>
<s> the line the SIP URI scheme (RFC 2543) seems to have slipped from following the generic pattern, used by http and others (with the "authority" component introduced by "//"), to a pattern that looks more like  </s>
<s> that seems like an unfortunate slippage, but I suppose it's to late to fix that now.  </s>

<s> Do you mean the convention to pick out some user names and use them to denote something else than users?  </s>
<s> In general, such conventions are considered a bad idea (the less of it the better), but I don't understand enough of SIP to assess this particular case.  </s>
<s> In addition to the arguments you give in section 6, proliferation should also be looked at.  </s>
<s> With postmaster@example.org,  </s>
<s> there is only one such address used up, and everybody in the email community knows this rather well.  </s>
<s> Your draft already has three or four, and there might be more  </s>
<s> in the future.  </s>
<s> People won't necessarily know what they all mean, and may not suspect that they stand for something special.  </s>
<s> One solution to this problem may be to change sip:annc@example.net.... to sip:special-annc@example.net (choose whatever appropriate for the 'special' prefix).  </s>
<s> Another issue I think is the use of URIs within URIs.  </s>
<s> You use examples with quotes: sip:annc@ms2.example.net;  </s>
<s> \ play="http://audio.example.net/allcircuitsbusy.g711" and examples without quotes: sip:annc@ms.example.net;  </s>
<s> \ play=file://fs.example.net/clips/my-intro.dvi; \ content-type=video/mpeg%3bencode%d3314M-25/625-50 My general observation of practice in many different places is to 1) not use quotes or anything similar, and 2) to only escape what needs to be escaped (although more escaping is often done because implementations of escaping try not to be context-dependent).  </s>
<s> As an aside, the 'locale' production also has problems, because it limits languages to those that have two-letter codes (see RFC 3066).  </s>

<s> In theory, any special prefix suffers the same problem.  </s>
<s> "annc" takes away from the namespace the same as "special-annc".  </s>
<s> In practice, it is in fact the way SIP is used that makes the namespace issue a non-problem.  </s>
<s> The "reserved" users are typically at a device or proxy.  </s>
<s> They are not exposed externally, as discussed in Section 6 of the draft.  </s>
<s> That is an excellent suggestion which will go into the next draft.  </s>
<s> Absolutely correct -- I'll fix this one, too, refering to RFC3066.  </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your review of the draft!  </s>

<s> It's dangerous to assume that names of any kind will never leak out.  </s>
<s> One idea would be to prefix them with "sip" and follow them with "master".  </s>
<s> People are already used to the idea that names ending in "master" have  </s>
<s> special meaning: postmaster, newsmaster, webmaster.  </s>
<s> "annc" looks much more like a plausible username (for "Ann C.") than sipanncmaster does.  </s>

<s> If we were to assume that a URL -at a host- somehow leaked out as a URI -in a domain-, would John's proposal, to prepend the user name with 'sip' and postfix it with 'master' alleviate the potential problem?  </s>
