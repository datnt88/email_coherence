<s> Following up on Frank's excellent reification process, and the decision we made last week support the provenance use case, I'm wondering if we can move forward on reification.  </s>
<s> I wonder if at this weeks telecon we can decide that the answer to the question: Does stmt1 rdf:type rdf:Statement .  </s>

<s> stmt2 rdf:predicate predicate .  </s>

<s> Regarding Graham's entailment:  </s>
<s> ex:subj ex:prop ex:obj .  </s>
<s> entails _:r rdf:type rdf:Statement .  </s>
<s> _:r rdf:subject ex:subj .  </s>
<s> _:r rdf:predicate ex:prop .  </s>
<s> _:r rdf:object ex:obj .  </s>
<s> Whilst I see the sense behind it, I'm a bit concerned by the practical implications of all the statements in my graph entailing their reifications.  </s>
<s> So from a standpoint of simplicity and pragmatics, I propose that there are NO other entailments in the model theory to do with reification.  </s>

<s> What do you see the practical implementations of this entailment being?  </s>
<s> Given the view of  </s>
<s> as a "stating" (inscription, statement occurrence, aka "triple"), I  </s>
<s> don't see how we can logically (?) deny that the presense of this triple entails that "there exists a statement with [such and such characteristics]".  </s>
<s> Haven't we just said it?  </s>
<s> Does the problem have to  </s>
<s> do with what we say instances of rdf:Statement are (statements or triples)?  </s>
<s> I.e., we can't say "there exists a statement..." because it isn't one, it's a triple?  </s>
<s> A more practical issue, it seems to me, is that even if all the statements in your graph entail their reifications, what's the point?  </s>
<s> There's no way (in RDF) to associate any generated reifications with the  </s>
<s> original triples.  </s>
<s> Conversely, if I have some way of identifying triples by associating URIs with them, I can define triples expressing provenance or anything else about them without any special reification syntax.  </s>
<s> Mind you, given that I can identify individual triples in this way, I still might find it useful to have a "standard" vocabulary, like rdf:predicate , for referring to the various parts of the triples, but that wouldn't necessarily have anything to do with provenance.  </s>

<s> Nah, its just that if I've got an "inferencing model", our term for an implementation of a graph that implements the closure rule, I'll have all these entailed reifications which are just so much junk getting in the way.  </s>
<s> Yes. Much better put; I think that's what was really on my mind.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> My original idea was something like that even if you were somehow "logically compelled" to admit these entailments (by which I meant they would be proper if you did them, although I didn't think you actually had to), there wouldn't be any reason to do them.  </s>
<s> Pat's comment on the "logical compulsion" aspect that "the 'world' being described by an RDF graph isn't required to include the graph itself" was further clarification.  </s>
