<s> Sorry to pollute the mail list with a mundane posting  </s>
<s> [Not sure what went wrong, but her'e a second attempt ...] Sorry to pollute the list with a banal topic but while thinking about what needs to be documented wrt the WG's test cases in: it seems like a consistent file naming convention would be useful.  </s>
<s> Anyhow, below are some related questions and comments.  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> 1. Would the person(s) that created the following test cases: ./rdfms-abouteach/test1.rdf ./rdfms-aboutEach-on-object/test1.rdf ./rdfms-nested-bagIDs/test1.rdf ./rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr/test1.rdf please tell me if these are legitimate test cases or not?  </s>
<s> That is, were they created soley as a way to test writing on the W3C's site or are they good tests?  </s>
<s> If they are good tests then would whomever created the test cases, please create a corresponding N-Triples file?  </s>
<s> 2. The most common practice is to name files that contain illegal RDF: error nnnn .nrdf where nnnn is a sequence number and I believe the "nrdf" means "not RDF".  </s>
<s> Since the file naming convention should probably be documented [for the public], I'm wondering if we want to stick with this convention.  </s>
<s> It seems kind'a redundant to name them both error and nrdf and that simply error nnnn .rdf would be sufficient to convey that the file is illegal RDF. 3. The following files: ./rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test1.nt ./rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test1.rdf ./rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.nt ./rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.rdf do not follow the commonly used file naming convention of: test nnnn .rdf  </s>
<s> Although I don't recall any discussion of "the" file naming convention, I think it would be good to be consistent thus I would recommend that the following files be renamed to test000{1,2}.{nt,rdf}.  </s>
<s> Likewise, to be consistent with other error files the following file: ./rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/error1.rdf should be renamed to error0001.rdf or error000.nrdf  </s>
<s> depending on what folks think about #2 above.  </s>
<s> 4. I like the way Aaron created an "Overview.html"  </s>
<s> file in: Although I don't a README-type file should be required, it is a nice touch.  </s>
<s> BTW Aaron, can this file be obsoleted: ./rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/index.html  </s>
<s> Hi Art,  </s>
<s> I actually took those from the issues list and used them "to test writing on the W3C's site", no less, no more please remove them as this is half baken work (sorry, next time I will try to do better) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
