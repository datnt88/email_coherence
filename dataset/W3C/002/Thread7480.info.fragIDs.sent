<s> It seems to me that WebDAV is silent on this question - it just does whatever HTTP 1.1 does.  </s>
<s> HTTP mandates support for UTF-8, which defines the encoding (your point number 3).  </s>
<s> I don't see (but may have missed) any language that prohibits other encodings.  </s>
<s> By "same encoding" did you mean same algorithm (e.g. always UTF-8) or  </s>
<s> byte-for-byte identical when using the same algorithm?  </s>
<s> If the latter, section 3.4 of RFC 2068 says "a character set may provide more than one sequence of octets to represent a particular character", which to me implies that HTTP servers in general, and WebDAV serves in particular, need not guarantee that the octet sequence returned by a GET is byte for byte identical with the one created with a PUT.  </s>
<s> I don't even see a requirement there that the sequence returned be the 'canonical' one, if there is a choice.  </s>
<s> That's my opinion, but I don't consider myself expert.  </s>
<s> Jim  </s>
<s> That's starting to answer the question for entities; HTTP/1.1 doesn't have properties.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1, at the start of section 9.6, says ``The PUT method requests that the  </s>
<s> enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI''.  </s>
<s> I'd say the most natural interpretation of this is that the entity body be preserved byte-for-byte.  </s>
<s> I assume that properties will be treated just like entity bodies.  </s>
<s> the  </s>
<s> Uh, I think you'll find some disagreement on this.  </s>
<s> For one thing, consider  </s>
<s> active content (e.g. server side includes).  </s>
<s> Earlier traffic on this list (Sorry, I don't have time to search for it) has stressed the *absence* of any such guarantee.  </s>
<s> WebDAV does not, for example, promise that the result of a COPY is byte-for-byte the same.  </s>
<s> It says (7.8.1) the result is "a new resource ... whose state and behavior match that of the source resource as closely as possible".  </s>
<s> This is the last I'll say on the topic.  </s>
<s> Hopefully someone better informed will speak up.  </s>
<s> OK, thanks.  </s>
<s> I too hope others speak up.  </s>
<s> Am I right in presuming a server is allowed to offer "content negotiation" over  </s>
<s> charset of a resource given to it, necesarily in exactly one charset, by PUT? Presumably a server is also allowed to be completely inflexible in its "content negotiation" over charset.  </s>
<s> If these things are so, then I would not be surprised to hear that (1) a server is allowed, but certainly not required, to return exactly (byte-for-byte) the given entity body when given no guidance through Accept-Charset, and (2) a server is allowed, but certainly not required, to map given entity bodies into a single charset preferred by the server and offer only that charset in "content negotiation", and (3) lots of other variations, as these are all a matter of server policy, which the protocol aims to not restrict.  </s>
<s> Does WebDAV have anything like charset negotiation for properties?  </s>
<s> If not, it's not obvious to me that the above analysis would apply to properties.  </s>
<s> Section 14.2 of defines the accept-charset header that allows charset negotiation.  </s>
<s> This would apply to any method it is used with.  </s>
<s> Thus sending accept-charset with a PROPFIND does cause negotiation over the charset used in the PROPFIND response.  </s>
<s> Section 15 of specifies that all DAV systems MUST support the charset requirements of XML.  </s>
<s> Section 2.2 of http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#syntax specifies that all XML systems MUST support UTF-8 and UTF-16.  </s>
<s> Therefore you are guaranteed that that all DAV servers will be able to accept properties in UTF-8 or UTF-16 and be able to return properties in one of those two charsets.  </s>
<s> I hope this clarifies matters, Yaron  </s>
<s> HTTP explicitly places no requirements on the relationship between the data sent by a PUT and the data returned by a subsequent GET.  </s>
<s> Any number of transformations (including charset, encoding, or whatever) might be applied, for example.  </s>
<s> # HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin # server.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> I think you are reading too much into that sentence.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 does not define the extent to which a successful PUT affects the overall state of the origin server, such as how many new resources are created as a result of the PUT (versioning), or how it may impact interdependent resources (collections, derived resources like server-side include, etc.).  </s>
<s> However, it does define the semantics of what the PUT means for the exact resource being PUT.  </s>
<s> In particular, the origin server is not allowed to transform the content and then reply with 200 or 204 -- doing so would destroy the correspondence between the resource and the entity-header fields PUT with the entity, and make operations like a write-read-verify impossible.  </s>
<s> The only way to allow that sort of thing would be to introduce a new response code for 2xx Accepted with Transform, which would tell the UA that it needs to re-GET the resource if it wants to know what was actually created.  </s>
<s> [BTW, I do think it would be a good idea for WebDAV to add such a response code.]  </s>
<s> Folks who are worried about derived resources like server-side includes or automatic charset translaters should rest easy -- WebDAV servers will not allow such resources to be PUT directly.  </s>
<s> Instead, the server must inform the client that the derived resource does not allow PUT, and that its "source resource" is at another URL.  </s>
<s> The same applies to resources that are negotiation handles for variants.  </s>
<s> In addition to simplifying the semantic questions, this approach makes it easier for a server to control read access for things that non-authors should never see.  </s>
