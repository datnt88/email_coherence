Previous threads can be followed from following the actions recorded in the meeting at 
I have amended the previous resolutions (#3-#5,#6 deleted in above) to give the following with new #3-#9 expanding on grammar and document changes. 
1. The current RDF/XML syntax uses the following attributes in the syntax: about aboutEach aboutEachPrefix ID bagID resource parseType -- List of RDF attributes (henceforth The List) The remaining concepts are not in the list because: a. Seq Bag Alt Property Statement These are rdfs:Class-es and can never be used as attributes b. RDF Description Syntax only things that have no current use as attributes c. li _ n subject predicate object type value Not allowed to be used unprefixed according to the grammar Note Re: aboutEach aboutEachPrefix Note that there are other issues relating to aboutEach and aboutEachPrefix. 
The resolution of those issues may affect the inclusion of these attributes in The List. 2. Namespace qualification MUST be used for all RDF attributes on The List, where the namespace URI is The meaning of the attributes is defined by the appropriate RDF M&amp;S sections and is not modified here. 
3. The updated grammar productions required for #2 in are as follows. 
[6.6] idAttr ::= ' rdf:ID="' IDsymbol '"' [6.7] aboutAttr ::= ' rdf:about="' URI-reference '"' 
[6.8] aboutEachAttr ::= ' rdf:aboutEach="' URI-reference '"' 
' rdf:aboutEachPrefix="' string '"' 
[6.9] bagIdAttr ::= ' rdf:bagID="' IDsymbol '"' [6.11] typeAttr ::= ' rdf:type="' URI-reference '"' [6.18] resourceAttr ::= ' resource="' URI-reference '"' [6.32] parseLiteral ::= ' rdf:parseType="Literal"' [6.33] parseResource ::= ' rdf:parseType="Resource"' 4. Namespace qualification MUST be used for all property attributes. 
Discussion: this is to address the point Art Barstow raised in when he pointed out the grammar allowed non-prefixed properties. 
5. The updated grammar production required for #4 is: [6.19] Qname ::= NSprefix ':' name 6. As a consequence of #4 the following paragraph is removed from It is recommended that property names always be qualified with a namespace prefix to unambiguously connect the property definition with the corresponding schema. 
in the annotated M&amp;S copy this is http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#215 
since this is now required, not optional. 
7. There are certainly other changes needed throughout the rest of the document such as all the examples and all other mentions of the attributes - there are probably over a hundred of these. 
8. Non-prefixed RDF elements (NOT attributes) are allowed when a default XML element namespace is defined with an xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" attribute. 
9. The grammar changes required from #8 in are all productions mentioning an rdf: element: 6.1, 6.3, 6.25, 6.26, 6.27, 6.29 which need to be changed to also allow the unprefixed form, for example: [6.1] RDF ::= [' rdf:RDF ' ] obj* [' /rdf:RDF '] 
[' RDF xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" ] obj* [' /RDF '] 
and so on for the other productions, but this is rather verbose to express in this BNF and might be better addressed by more words.

Er... thanks for the details about which parts of the spec are affected, but the action item is also about test cases; I don't see any here; you're still getting those together, right? 
Please let's not wordsmith this resolution stuff any more. 
As a group, we made the relevant decisions and we're done with this, provided the associated actions get done presently; i.e. provided you provide test cases and BrianM links them from the errata document, as we agreed last Fri. 
Brian, the errata 
still shows Updated $Date: 2001/03/05 14:36:19 $ Did EricM get you what you need to write to it? 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
Dave sent the tests separately: 
Speaking of the errata - would it be appropriate for the errata to contain pointers to discussions/justifications in the w3c-rdfcore-wg mail archive? 
Strong agreement. 
I'm getting to that, hopefully tomorrow.
