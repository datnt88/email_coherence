Last week we discussed teleconference facilities at the f2f. 
Of the folks who can't be there, who would participate in a telecon starting at 4pm (10am EST, 7am PST) each day? 
I suggest we summarize the decisions made earlier in the day and discuss any issues held over for the telecon. 
I'd like to stress though, that the folks attending the telecon, are empowered to make decisions. 
Eric - can you please book a conference bridge for those times for two hours (we don't have to use it all) and telecon facilities at the f2f venue.

Do you mean each day of next week, or just of the RDF Core part? 
If the former, I can be on it except Wednesday.

The teleconference has been booked and I'm pleased to say we were able to get the same number that is burned into all of your brains.
