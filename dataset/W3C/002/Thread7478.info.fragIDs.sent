<s> Based on the minutes of the April 2 WebDAV meeting, it looks to me as if  </s>
<s> there is no consensus that ordered collections are needed.  </s>
<s> (Those who were  </s>
<s> present, correct me if this is the wrong interpretation.)  </s>
<s> A number of requirements (3.2.6 - 3.2.8) for complicated sorts of orderings will probably be dropped because they are equivalent to creating multiple collections, each with a single, simple ordering.  </s>
<s> These were the requirements for multiple orderings on a single collections, for orderings that include a single member multiple times, and orderings that include only a subset of collection members.  </s>
<s> Once these go away, requirement 3.2.3 becomes simply the requirement that a client be able to request that a  </s>
<s> response to a PROPFIND present the members order defined for that collection.  </s>
<s> So suppose we allow only a single ordering, and that it must contain each collection member exactly once.  </s>
<s> Now it seems reasonable to say that we are getting nothing beyond what we could already get from a search with a sorting capability.  </s>
<s> (I'm trying to reconstruct a train of thought from the minutes.  </s>
<s> Correct me if I am wrong.)  </s>
<s> My view about this is that if we didn't have an ordering capability independent of search, we would in effect be implementing ordering as a property on each member of a collection.  </s>
<s> I want to suggest that this is a bad implementation of ordering.  </s>
<s> In particular, it violates requirement 3.2.9 that it be possible to modify an ordering efficiently.  </s>
<s> Search with sort works well for ordering if the property that is the basis of the sort has a semantic life of its own independent of the ordering.  </s>
<s> That is, if we assign values to the property *not* based on solving the problem of getting the resource to sort to the right position, but based on some intrinsic feature of the resource.  </s>
<s> So I assign a value to "Author"  </s>
<s> based on who created the resource, and it happens that I can sort  </s>
<s> alphabetically on author.  </s>
<s> Or I can assign a value to "Difficulty-level" and then it's possible to sort from easy to difficult.  </s>
<s> But if I have 15 chapters of a book that I want to appear in a certain  </s>
<s> order, assigning a value to an "order" property is a bad way to get them to sort into that order.  </s>
<s> I can't just assign 1 to the first chapter, 2 to the second, etc., unless I know that I will never want to insert a new chapter in the middle of the book.  </s>
<s> I can leave gaps between the values to allow for some number of insertions, but those might get used up.  </s>
<s> In short, maintenance of an ordering implemented in this way is extremely inefficient.  </s>
<s> So my view is that a better implementation of ordering is the one many people have had in mind all along: as a property on the collection that lists its members in the desired order.  </s>

<s> Hmm. I wouldn't go this far -- my sense of the room was there is  </s>
<s> substantial support for ordered collections.  </s>
<s> Exactly what is meant by  </s>
<s> "ordered" was the topic underlying most debate.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Not exactly -- ordered collections can support arbitrary orderings (i.e., put "bar" first, "foo" second, "xxx" third, etc.) which is impossible to accomplish with sorting.  </s>
<s> This isn't the only possible ordering.  </s>
<s> As you point out in your last paragraph, ordering information could be maintained in a property on the collection.  </s>
<s> Or, perhaps the repository for ordering state isn't even available via a WebDAV abstraction (e.g., a database record), and is only retrievable via a WebDAV property.  </s>
<s> Short answer: I don't think this creates any efficiency concerns.  </s>
<s> So this scenario sounds like a good use of DASL.  </s>
<s> This sounds like a good use of DAV ordered collections.  </s>
<s> Well, I tihnk this will need to be explored in the protocol document for  </s>
<s> ordered collections, but it strikes me that this might be a good way to  </s>
<s> quickly retrieve the ordering of a collection.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if PROPFIND of Depth 1 can also retrieve the ordering of a collection, perhaps we don't want two ways of getting at the same information.  </s>

<s> Discussions of the WEBDAV working group are archived at URL: http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth .  </s>
<s> Abstract The base WebDAV protocol [Goland et al., 1998] provides basic support for collections.  </s>
<s> It defines a MKCOL method for creating collections and specifies how other HTTP and WebDAV methods interact with collections.  </s>
<s> It supports only internal members of collections, which it defines as members whose URIs are immediately relative to the URI of the collection.  </s>
<s> This draft sets out requirements for more advanced, optional collection functionality.  </s>
<s> It extends the base functionality in two general directions: support for referential members, and support for ordered collections.  </s>
<s> A separate WebDAV specification is expected to define protocol elements providing the functionality described here.  </s>
<s> 1 Terminology The terminology used here differs from that in the base WebDAV protocol specification [Goland et al., 1998], particularly in its definition of internal member resource.  </s>
<s> Collection A resource that contains member resources Member Resource A resource contained by a collection Referential Member Resource A member resource that has no content of its own, but rather is a reference to another resource  </s>
<s> Strong Reference A reference whose integrity is guaranteed by the server Weak Reference A reference whose integrity is not guaranteed by the server  </s>
<s> Internal Member Resource A member resource that either has content of its own or is empty, but is not a reference to another resource Target Resource The resource referenced by a referential member of a collection 2 Introduction and Rationale The simple collections that the base WebDAV specification supports are powerful enough to be widely useful.  </s>
<s> They provide for the hierarchical organization of resources, with mechanisms for creating and deleting collections, copying and moving them, locking them, adding resources to them and deleting resources from them, and getting listings of their members.  </s>
<s> Delete, copy, move, list, and lock operations can be applied recursively, so that a client can operate on whole hierarchies with a single request.  </s>
<s> Many applications, however, need more powerful collections.  </s>
<s> There are two areas in particular where more powerful functionality is often needed: referential members and ordering.  </s>
<s> This draft details the additional functionality that is needed in these two areas.  </s>
<s> 2.1 Referential Members Referential members make it possible for many collections, on the  </s>
<s> same or different servers, to share the same resource.  </s>
<s> Because the collections share the resource by referencing it, only one  </s>
<s> physical copy of the resource need exist, and any changes made in  </s>
<s> the resource are visible from all the collections that reference  </s>
<s> it.  </s>
<s> So, for example, the mathematics department at one university can create a collection of resources on fractals that contains some local resources, but also references resources at several other universities.  </s>
<s> A manufacturing company develops and maintains its product maintenance manuals on the Web, with a separate collection for each product manual.  </s>
<s> Each manual is divided into sections, one section for every product component.  </s>
<s> Since many of the company?s  </s>
<s> products contain some of the same components, many of the product maintenance manuals have sections in common.  </s>
<s> Each manual may have some unique sections, which are internal members of its collection.  </s>
<s> But for product components that are common to multiple products, the manual has a referential member that references a resource in a shared library.  </s>
<s> 2.2 Ordered Collections It is useful for many applications to be able to impose an ordering on a collection.  </s>
<s> In the product manual application  </s>
<s> above, the sections of each manual may be ordered so that they can be printed together as a book.  </s>
<s> A configuration management application might use a collection to represent a version series, in which case the "derives from" relationship might be represented as an ordering on the collection.  </s>
<s> A collection ordering may sometimes be based on property values.  </s>
<s> An example of such an ordering is one that is alphabetical by author?s last name, or one from most recent to oldest last- modified-date.  </s>
<s> An ordering need not be based on property values, however.  </s>
<s> A professor may order a collection of course readings in the sequence that makes sense to coordinate them with her lectures, where there is no property on the member resources that could be used to create this ordering.  </s>
<s> WebDAV already provides tools that could be used for creating and maintaining ordered collections.  </s>
<s> For example, using only the base WebDAV specification, an application could create a WebDAV property called "Order" on a collection resource.  </s>
<s> The value of this property might be a list of the URIs of the collection members.  </s>
<s> What the base WebDAV specification does not do is standardize a single way to represent orderings for collections.  </s>
<s> Different applications and services should be able to operate on the same collection without private agreements about how to manage and examine its order.  </s>
<s> To make this possible, there needs to be a standard way to manipulate and retrieve the order of a collection, and a standard representation of the ordering.  </s>
<s> In any situation where collaborative management of a collection  </s>
<s> takes place, and different authoring tools or WebDAV servers might  </s>
<s> be used by the collaborators, standardization is important.  </s>
<s> It is also important where a different tool may be used to view the collection from the one that was used to create it.  </s>
<s> So for example, two users from different organizations, using different authoring tools, are working together to create a collection.  </s>
<s> One of the tools uses a property on the collection  </s>
<s> called "Order" to store an ordering of the collection.  </s>
<s> The other  </s>
<s> tool uses a property on the member called "SequenceNumber".  </s>
<s> If each user adds some members to the collection, there will be no reliable ordering.  </s>
<s> 3 Requirements  </s>
<s> 3.1 Referential Members of Collections Requirements 3.1.1  </s>
<s> - 3.1.5  </s>
<s> follow naturally from the definition of Referential Member Resource.  </s>
<s> Although the behavior of referential members could be forced to be different from what is described in these requirements, the fact that referential members are references to other resources makes the behavior described here the natural one, and the easy one to implement.  </s>
<s> 3.1.1  </s>
<s> The same resource may be referenced by referential members of multiple collections.  </s>
<s> This is the primary benefit that referential members bring.  </s>
<s> Resources can be shared by multiple collections, which may reside on the same server as the shared resource or on other servers.  </s>
<s> 3.1.2  </s>
<s> The same resource may be referenced by more than one referential member of the same collection.  </s>
<s> It is often useful to allow the same resource to be referenced in a collection multiple times.  </s>
<s> Typically, these are cases where the collection is ordered.  </s>
<s> Consider a case where a collection represents a book, with one member resource for each page in the book.  </s>
<s> A particular graphic needs to appear in several places in the book, and so needs to appear in the collection several times.  </s>
<s> 3.1.3  </s>
<s> It is possible for the same resource to be an internal member of a collection and also to be referenced by one or more referential members of that same collection.  </s>
<s> In the example just described, the collection might contain the graphic as an internal member, which is also referenced by referential members of the same collection so that it can appear multiple times in the book.  </s>
<s> 3.1.4  </s>
<s> Operations on a referential member do not affect the resource it references.  </s>
<s> There needs to be some way to operate on the referential member itself.  </s>
<s> If requests to the referential member were automatically redirected to its target resource, this would not be possible.  </s>
<s> Passing operations through to the target resource would expose servers to the risks of circular references and long chains of references that refer to other references.  </s>
<s> In addition, passing operations through to the target resource can be problematic if the referential member and the target resource are on different servers.  </s>
<s> Issues about what credentials to use would need to be addressed.  </s>
<s> Requirement 3.1.6  </s>
<s> makes it unnecessary for the server to pass operations through to the target resource.  </s>
<s> The client can always obtain the URI of the target resource and operate directly on the target.  </s>
<s> 3.1.5  </s>
<s> Operations on a resource do not affect weak references to them.  </s>
<s> This requirement is the mirror of 3.1.4.  </s>
<s> Just as we do not expect operations on a reference to affect its target, so we do not expect operations on a target to affect references to it.  </s>
<s> Locking a target does not cause the references to it to be locked.  </s>
<s> Modifying the properties of a target does not cause changes in the properties of references to it.  </s>
<s> Etc.  </s>
<s> Just as in 3.1.4  </s>
<s> passing operations through to the target can be problematic, so here reflecting operations back to the referencing resource can be problematic if the referential member and the target resource are on different servers.  </s>
<s> Issues about what credentials to use would need to be addressed.  </s>
<s> The requirement cannot apply to all referential members, however.  </s>
<s> Section 1 defined weak references and strong references.  </s>
<s> Strong references are those whose referential integrity is guaranteed by the server.  </s>
<s> Weak references are those whose referential integrity is not guaranteed by the server.  </s>
<s> For strong references, some operations on targets must cause changes in references to them.  </s>
<s> For strong references, if the target is moved, the reference must change to reflect the new location of the target, for example.  </s>
<s> Requirement 3.1.11  </s>
<s> makes it possible that some servers will support strong references.  </s>
<s> Consequently, the requirement cannot apply to all referential members, but only to weak references.  </s>
<s> 3.1.6  </s>
<s> For any referential member of a collection, it is possible to obtain the URI of the resource it references.  </s>
<s> This will allow clients to resolve references themselves in order to operate on the target resources.  </s>
<s> 3.1.7  </s>
<s> It is possible to add a referential member to a collection.  </s>
<s> 3.1.8  </s>
<s> It is possible to remove a referential member from a collection.  </s>
<s> It is important to note that this is a different operation from deleting the referential member?s  </s>
<s> target resource.  </s>
<s> According to requirement 3.1.4,  </s>
<s> operations on a referential member do not affect the target resource, so removing a referential member from a collection does not cause its target resource to be deleted.  </s>
<s> 3.1.9  </s>
<s> It is possible for a referential member of a collection to carry its own properties, distinct from those of the resource it refers to.  </s>
<s> There are properties like "who added this resource to this collection" and "when was this resource added to this collection" that clearly belong to the referential member, and not to its target resource, which may be referenced by referential members of many collections.  </s>
<s> 3.1.10  </s>
<s> A listing of the members of a collection shows both the internal members and the referential members.  </s>
<s> A listing of collection members with Depth = 1 shows all members of  </s>
<s> the collection, whether internal or external.  </s>
<s> If Depth = infinity,  </s>
<s> however, the listing will not follow references into any collections to which they may refer.  </s>
<s> This is to avoid the risk of being caught in a circle of references.  </s>
<s> 3.1.11  </s>
<s> It is possible to request creation of a referential member that the server will guarantee to have referential integrity.  </s>
<s> For some applications, broken references are unacceptable.  </s>
<s> Breakage may be unavoidable when a target resource resides on a different server from the referential member that references it.  </s>
<s> Servers can, however, maintain the integrity of referential collection members when they receive MOVE or DELETE requests for resources under their own control.  </s>
<s> For applications that require referential integrity, it must be possible to specify with a request for creation of a referential member that its integrity  </s>
<s> be guaranteed.  </s>
<s> If the server cannot honor this request, it must decline to create the referential member.  </s>
<s> A referential member whose integrity is guaranteed by the server is called a strong reference.  </s>
<s> 3.1.12  </s>
<s> For any member of a collection, it is possible to discover whether it is an internal or a referential member.  </s>
<s> Since operations on referential members are not passed through to their targets, it is important for clients to be able to discover which members are referential.  </s>
<s> Then the client can resolve the references for the referential members to perform operations on their targets.  </s>
<s> 3.1.13  </s>
<s> It is possible to discover whether a referential member is a strong reference or a weak reference.  </s>
<s> Knowing whether a referential member is strong or weak allows a client to choose intelligently its own strategy for working with  </s>
<s> referential members.  </s>
<s> For example, if a client does not know whether a particular reference is strong or weak, it may choose to recreate that referential member to be sure of referential integrity; but if it knows that the reference is strong, it will not bother to do this.  </s>
<s> 3.1.14  </s>
<s> It is possible to discover whether a resource is the target of a strong reference.  </s>
<s> This requirement insures that both ends of a referential integrity relationship have the same information available.  </s>
<s> 3.2 Ordered Collections 3.2.1 Ordering is sufficiently standardized that different applications and servers can operate on the same ordering without private agreements.  </s>
<s> Applications and servers can apply an ordering to a collection?s members or discover the ordering of a collection's members without private agreements.  </s>
<s> They can also modify an ordering, at least with the help of a human user for semantics (See 3.2.2), without private agreements.  </s>
<s> This is the minimum that is needed to support collaborative management of an ordered collection, where different authoring tools might be used by the collaborators.  </s>
<s> It is also what allows a different tool to be used to view the collection from the one that was used to create it.  </s>
<s> Finally, it is needed in order for servers to list collection members in order, as required by 3.2.3.  </s>
<s> 3.2.2  </s>
<s> The semantics of an ordering are discoverable.  </s>
<s> The semantics of an ordering is the principle or rule according to which the collection members are ordered.  </s>
<s> This principle must be discoverable if someone (or some application) other than the one that created a collection is to be able to add a member to it and determine where it makes sense to position the new member in the collection's ordering.  </s>
<s> In some cases it may be possible for the semantics to be expressed in a machine-usable way, so that an application could automatically position a new member in the ordering.  </s>
<s> In other cases the semantics may require a human user to apply them.  </s>
<s> In either case they should be discoverable.  </s>
<s> 3.2.3  </s>
<s> When a client requests a listing of the members of a collection, it can request that the collection ordering be applied to the response.  </s>
<s> The server may decline to support the request for an ordered response.  </s>
<s> Although servers may ignore the request that the member listing be ordered, defining a request syntax that includes an ordering makes it possible for servers to free clients from the burden of applying the ordering to the member listing.  </s>
<s> 3.2.4  </s>
<s> It is possible to order the members of a collection in a client-specified way, not necessarily based on property values.  </s>
<s> Orderings that are based on property values can be obtained by a search protocol that supports sorted result sets.  </s>
<s> This set of requirements is not concerned with such orderings.  </s>
<s> It is intended primarily to support orderings that cannot be obtained by sorting on property values.  </s>
<s> A property is not always available that can serve as the basis for a desired ordering.  </s>
<s> For example, a professor may wish to order a collection of course readings in the sequence that makes sense to coordinate the readings with her lectures.  </s>
<s> But the properties of resources at the Web site are standardized and do not include one that is appropriate to use for this purpose.  </s>
<s> Even if the professor in the example could create a "sequencenumber" property to use in sorting the collection, this strategy would be undesirable unless she knew she would not be adding any readings or changing the order of her lectures once the values of sequencenumber were set.  </s>
<s> Inserting a new reading into the sequence would require updating the sequencenumber property of each reading that comes after the new one in the sequence.  </s>
<s> Ordered collections are intended to support this sort of case, where sorting based on a property value is impossible or inefficient.  </s>
<s> 3.2.5 Internal and referential members may be intermixed in the same ordering.  </s>
<s> The professor in the previous example may store some readings as internal resources of the collection, but reference others from servers at another university.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, all the readings need to be included in the ordering for her students?  </s>
<s> use.  </s>
<s> 3.2.6  </s>
<s> It is possible to modify an existing ordering efficiently.  </s>
<s> The implementation of orderings and operations on them should minimize the number of round trips and the amount of data transferred when modifying an existing ordering.  </s>
<s> This includes cases where a single collection member is inserted into an ordering or removed from an ordering, as well as cases where many collection members are moved to different positions in the ordering.  </s>

<s> Super job Judy!  </s>
<s> I have a few, mostly nitpicky comments below.  </s>
<s> 1) I have is the perception that there are really two different kinds of  </s>
<s> ordered collections.  </s>
<s> The first are "live" collections where the ordering is  </s>
<s> maintained by the server, and any attempt by the client to place a resource  </s>
<s> at a specific location in a collection will (unless the client is lucky and  </s>
<s> places the resource where the server would put it anyway) not work.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> second are "static" collections where the client maintains the ordering, and places resources in exact locations.  </s>
<s> With "live" collections, the server  </s>
<s> maintains the semantics of the ordering, whereas with "static" collections, the client maintains the ordering.  </s>
<s> I think the ordered collections protocol draft needs to support both kinds.  </s>
<s> I think it would be useful to add some discussion of this distinction to Section 2.2 (which touches on it in the second paragraph), since these categories and labels will be useful in our discussion.  </s>
<s> 2) Requirement 3.2.3 should be strengthened so a server always has to return  </s>
<s> the members of a collection in order.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking of wording something along the lines of: When a client requests a listing of the members of a collection, this listing is returned in the order specified by the collection.  </s>
<s> 3) I think requirement 3.2.6 (it is possible to modify an existing ordering efficiently) should be removed.  </s>
<s> As stated it would be hard to determine whether a given protocol did or did not meet the requirement.  </s>
<s> I think there is agreement in the working group that the ordering protocol needs to be efficient, but adding a requirement for this doesn't really contribute much towards achieving this goal.  </s>
<s> Minor points follow:  </s>
<s> I'd add "referential" before integrity in both these definitions.  </s>
<s> Instead of "physical copy", I prefer the term "authoritative location" since  </s>
<s> it is technically possible to have the same physical data chunk accessible  </s>
<s> at multiple locations (e.g., a file which can be accessed via FTP and HTTP),  </s>
<s> so by referring to one of these location with a referential member, the referential member doesn't really point to the physical data chunk, it points to one location at which that physical data chunk can be accessed.  </s>
<s> I prefer the wording: For many applications, it is useful to impose an ordering on a collection.  </s>
<s> At the end of the last sentence, add "across tools."  </s>
<s> Rather than debating exactly what we mean by "natural", I think that the word "naturally" should be removed from the first sentence, and the second sentence should be removed.  </s>
<s> of  </s>
<s> infinity,  </s>
<s> Since a listing of collection members with depth infinity will also list the internal and external members of a collection, I recommend changing the first sentence to read: A listing of collection members with Depth = 1 or Depth = infinity shows all members of the collection, whether internal or external.  </s>
<s> "with" -- "in"  </s>
<s> The Enterprise may boldly go, but in this case, I think the client should "intelligently choose".  </s>
<s> That's it.  </s>
<s> I think we should be able to wrap these up soon after the Redmond meeting.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Thanks for your comments, Jim.  </s>
<s> I've made most of your suggested changes, but I'm hesitating about a few of them.  </s>
<s> I think that we have gradually been paring back the ordered collections  </s>
<s> requirements to arrive at a point where the server is not required to maintain orderings in any way -- so that orderings are always "dead," client-maintained.  </s>
<s> Jim Davis has expressed his opposition to server-maintained orderings.  </s>
<s> In the more distant past, Yaron did, too, although he may not care so much now that ordered collections are in a separate specification.  </s>
<s> So I'm a little reluctant to add back in a requirement for "live" orderings.  </s>
<s> That said, here's a related problem.  </s>
<s> Based on the LA meeting, I took out the requirements for orderings that contain only a subset of collections members and for orderings that contain a collection member more than once.  </s>
<s> The implication is that each collection member must be in an ordering  </s>
<s> exactly once -- I should have added a requirement to this effect to make it  </s>
<s> explicit.  </s>
<s> But once we say this, the server is required to do some work to maintain the integrity of the ordering -- it must prevent clients from adding members to orderings more than once and it must make sure that when a member gets added to a collection, it gets added to the ordering somewhere.  </s>
<s> This is, by the WebDAV definition, "live," whether or not the ordering is server-maintained (read-only).  </s>
<s> Again, Jim Davis and Yaron have both opposed requiring a server to apply the ordering to any list of collection members it returns.  </s>
<s> Jim's view is that it is just as easy for the client to retrieve the ordering and apply it.  </s>
<s> So that's how 3.2.3 got weakened to its current state.  </s>
<s> Are there others who think it should be strengthened again?  </s>
<s> I've stayed with "physical copy" because I think it's clearer and it's really the point.  </s>
<s> Whether the referential member points to its target at the FTP location or the HTTP location, the important thing is that we didn't have to make a physical copy of the resource inside the collection in order to get access to it through the collection.  </s>
<s> I kept this as it was because it's really true that there will be no  </s>
<s> reliable ordering.  </s>
<s> Period.  </s>
<s> It's not that one tool could get you access to  </s>
<s> a reliable ordering, but the other could not.  </s>
<s> Once you have modified an ordering using each of the tools, neither ordering is reliable any more.  </s>

<s> With "live"  </s>
<s> collections,  </s>
<s> Ahh. In this case, then, a note stating that the intent is to only support non-live ordering should be added.  </s>
<s> Well, this is certainly live in the sense that the server is performing some consistency checks before allowing a resource to be added to a collection, but it isn't live in the sense the server will be doing the actual ordering.  </s>
<s> So, I don't see a problem with the language in this case -- for any operation, the server is always allowed to perform some checks.  </s>
<s> However, this does raise a problem with repsect to referential members of collections, since we allow in 3.1.2 the same resource to be referenced multiple times int he same collection.  </s>
<s> However, since we haven't said anything about having a local name for references, this implies to me that the same URI can appear in a collection mutiple times (once as an internal member, and then potentially multiple times as an reference).  </s>
<s> An ordered collection then has to handle this situation.  </s>
<s> Except that I think they were thinking the server would be performing some action like alphabetizing the listing before sending it out.  </s>
<s> If the ordering is static (non-live), then returning the members of the collection in order seems reasonable to me.  </s>
<s> OK.  </s>
<s> OK. - Jim  </s>
<s> I've submitted a new draft of the collection requirements to Internet-Drafts, so they should be available in a few days.  </s>
<s> I made the following changes, mostly in response to Jim Whitehead's recent comments: 1.  </s>
<s> I added a paragraph discussing server-maintained vs. client-maintained orderings, and stated explicitly that the requirements are only for client-maintained orderings.  </s>
<s> 2. I added a requirement (3.2.2) stating that collections are not required to be ordered.  </s>
<s> 3. I added a requirement (3.2.4) stating that each collection member must appear in the ordering exactly once.  </s>
<s> I added some text explaining the implications of this for server behavior.  </s>
<s> 4. I added a requirement (3.2.5) stating that orderings must not contain resources that are not members of the collection, and again discussed the implications of this for server behavior.  </s>
<s> 5. I strengthened 3.2.6 to say that a server must return listings of collection members in the order specified by the collection ordering.  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> I added a requirement (3.1.15) stating that a referential member of a collection is itself a resource.  </s>
<s> I think this was already implied by the requirement that referential members be able to carry their own properties, but it needed to be made explicit.  </s>
<s> As Jim noted, this has implications for 3.2.4.  </s>
<s> ordering, and places resources in exact locations.  </s>
