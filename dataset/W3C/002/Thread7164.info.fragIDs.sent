<s> One other simpler modification to the grammar to address the problem of the path being undefined is: net-path = "//" authority net-path-suffix net-path-suffix = ["/" path-segments] path = abs-path / rel-path / net-path-suffix Of course, //ABCD+y in http://ABCD+y would still be parsed as a path.  </s>

<s> br br URI = scheme ":" ["//" authority] path [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] br br This rule reflects the five-component structure and the statement br that a path always exists, even if it is empty.  </s>
<s> It can be made br to work with either of the two following definitions of path: br br path = abs-path / rel-path br path = segment *( "/" segment ) br br Running a parser based on either of these changes with br all the test cases listed in section 5.4 (both normal and br abnormal examples) gives precisely the same results as br with the grammar of bis-02 or bis-03.  </s>
