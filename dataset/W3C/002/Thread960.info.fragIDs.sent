Hi, I found the tidy config option to supress warnings, but how do I get Tidy to also never show error messages? 
I am using it in an application where I want it to do the best it can do, but never complain 
about it. 
Thanks!

I couldn't find a setting to stop error messages, but I wrote a simple callback function which always returns false, and then registered it with tidySetReportFilter(), and that stops it from printing anything. 
I may fine-tune that later to report only useful information.
