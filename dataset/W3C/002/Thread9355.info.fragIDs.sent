It appears to me that we have two separate issues here: 1. 
The association of data type to literal. 
2. The prescriptive/descriptive nature of data types. 
Can you enlarge on that second point? 
I have no idea what you mean, and it doesn't seem to have come up before. 
For what its worth, I have always assumed that RDF is basically a descriptive language, so if 'prescriptive' is somehow in contrast to descriptive then I might take umbrage.

There was discussion about this a few weeks ago in the rdf-interest list (or was it rdf-logic...?) 
Anyway, the gist is that if both a local type and a range are defined, then the range can be seen as prescriptive such that a value can be deemed invalid if the local type is not equivalent to or a subclass of the range type. 
If no local type is defined for the value, then the range can be seen as descriptive of the type of the value. 
The latter is all fine and good, until we think about lexical forms and the fact that lexical forms are specific to a given data type, and thus, the descriptive approach is not reliable as it may suggest an interpretation for which the lexical form is either not valid or "unknown". 
See my other discussion about this point posted today, along with the assertion (which you are apparently going to take umbrage about) that range is *only* prescriptive... Cheers, Patrick 
Given the capabalities of RDFS, how could you know that one type is NOT a subClassOf another?

Thanks, but I still don't know what you are talking about. 
What does it mean to say that a value is 'invalid'? 
The way I see RDF is that triples make assertions. 
More triples make more assertions, which restrict the set of satisfying interpretations. 
There is no notion of some part of a triple being 'invalid': if you can write it down, then it ought to mean something. 
(If some construction is meaningless then we should rule it out as syntactically illegal; but there is a strong RDF cultural bias against this kind of restriction, for methodological reasons having to do with the 'open-ness' of the semantic web. ) 
Well, it can be unknown: that is harmless. 
I agree that we need some security against *incorrect* interpretations being used on literals, so they are interpreted in ways that are not the way intended.
