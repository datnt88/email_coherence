<s> Hi all, in our draft we have introduced the Reference's Type attribute to allow the signer to give a hint that the data referenced is of a special kind, such as Manifest, Object, SignatureProperty.  </s>
<s> In section 5.2 "The SignatureProperties Element" we define the type identifier for signature properties:  </s>
<s> Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig#SignatureProperty  </s>
<s> My question now is: What is the actual data this type identifier qualifies?  </s>
<s> Is it the enveloping SignatureProperties Element, or is it a single SignatureProperty child Element, as the name of the type identifier suggests?  </s>

<s> I don't think I can speak very well to the functionality or requirements of this feature, but I believe the spec says the actual data referenced is the thing pointed to by a Reference.  </s>
<s> Kind of awkward I agree... good ideas are welcome!  </s>

<s> The Reference Element  </s>
<s> The optional Type attribute contains information about the type of object being signed.  </s>
<s> This is represented as a URI.  </s>
<s> For example: Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig#Object" Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig#Manifest" Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig#SignatureProperty"  </s>
<s> The Type attribute applies to the item being pointed at, not its contents.  </s>
<s> For example, a reference that identifies an Object element  </s>
<s> containing a SignatureProperties element is still of type #Object.  </s>
<s> The type attribute is advisory.  </s>
<s> No validation of the type information is required by this specification.  </s>

<s> Hello Joseph, I think it would be a good idea, to change the identifier to #SignatureProperties, because only the enveloping SignatureProperties Element currently has defined an Id attribute, contrary to SignatureProperty.  </s>
<s> Otherwhise it would not be possible to refer to such an item using our XPointer shortcut as part of a URI reference.  </s>
<s> Gregor Gregor Karlinger Phone +43 316 873 5541 Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications Austria  </s>
<s> The other approach is to place an ID attribute in SignatureProperty, which seems like a better idea.  </s>
<s> So the identifier is the same, and SignatureProperty now has an ID.  </s>
<s> The grammar for SignatureProperty and SignatureProperties permits multiple instances of both, and that begs the question of what the semantic meaning is.  </s>
<s> Now, the grammar doesn't explicitly say this, it just states that you can place arbitrary content in an Object, and consequently you can repeat SignatureProperties if you so decided.  </s>
<s> But there's also the questin of where the Target attribute properly sits.  </s>
<s> Options: A. Remove all Targets; the SignatureProperty can only apply to the Signature it is within.  </s>
<s> (What if nested?)  </s>
<s> B. One and only one SignatureProperties per Signature, which includes a Target attribute that defines to which Signature the SignatureProperty(s) apply.  </s>
<s> (Remove Target from SignatureProperty(s)).  </s>
<s> C. Other?  </s>
<s> I advocate B.  </s>

<s> Hi Joseph,  </s>
<s> I am sorry, but I do not understand this question.  </s>
<s> If we restrict the properties to be applied only to the signature they are within, I do not see a problem with nesting.  </s>
<s> Can you please give an example?  </s>
<s> If we make this restriction (I do not see an argument against it), I suggest  </s>
<s> to reject the SignatureProperties element at all, since it only works as an additional "container" level between Object and SignatureProperty, but nothing else.  </s>
<s> In this case I also suggest to reject SignatureProperties.  </s>
<s> Instead, supply each SignatureProperty element with an Id AND a Target attribute.  </s>

<s> suggest  </s>
<s> That's a good point.  </s>
<s> It is rather superflous.  </s>
<s> I'd be interested in what others have to say...  </s>
<s> Well, I changed the example to make it clearer this is what should happpen (though I'm hesitant to make the change of removing SignatureProperties' ID, or the element itself without further discussion (though I agree with you on removing it.))  </s>
