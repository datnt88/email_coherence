Hi, We use the URI &amp;dsig;dsa-sha1 to identify the DSA signature algorithm; similarly, &amp;dsig;rsa-sha1 to identify RSA with 
SHA-1. 
I don't believe that we should use these same URIs 
to identify the actual public key encoding. 
The hash 
algorithm is unrelated to the key encoding. 
I would suggest 
that, for the purposes of RetrievalMethod, we use the URIs: 
In particular, bear in mind that additional documents will be produced that define rsa-md5, etc. at which point key encoding URIs will become confused if they are not clarified here.

Following up to, and changing, my opinion: 
I'm not sure that the language used in 4.4[1] is entirely correct: "The following list summarizes the |KeyInfo| types defined by this specification. 
[...]" 
Technically, the DSA and RSA types are |KeyValue| types, not |KeyInfo| types. 
I would suggest that we move all the text for RSA and DSA down to just above the text for &amp;dsig;rawX509Certificate and there state that the RSA and DSA |KeyValue| structures may appear as the target of a |RetrievalMethodType| identified by the URIs: 
Merlin [1] http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html#sec-KeyInfo r/merlin@baltimore.ie/2001.04.10/10:40:44 
Merlin, I' agree, and I've done this a few times myself (starting tweaking the document on this note to improve it, then confusing myself!). 
But I think your suggestion of needing different URIs for the algorithm versus their structure is an improvement. 
Ok, if I understand, you are suggesting: 1. 
We keep the &amp;dsig;dsa-sha1 and &amp;dsig;rsa-sha1 algorithm identifiers. 
2. We create section 4.4.2.1 and 4.4.2.2 for a DSA and RSA key values, and 
give them their own URIs. 
3. How much of section 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 do we move up in 4.4.2? Everything after the example SignatureMethod?

Hi Joseph, Yes, yes, and I think everything after the example SignatureValue?

Hi Joseph, Looks good; I like this structure better. 
Minor nitpick on section 4.4: "The following list summarizes the KeyInfo types defined in this section." 
The list is a) not an exhaustive list of the KeyInfo types defined in the section (reading "type" as described in the first paragraph, and not as "identifier") and b) not exclusively composed of KeyInfo types (if "KeyInfo types" refers just to elements of the KeyInfoType choice). 
Perhaps you'd consider a reordering: 4.4 The KeyInfo Element Existing paragraph: KeyInfo is an optional element... Existing paragraph: If KeyInfo is omitted, the recipient... Existing paragraph: The schema/DTD specifications of these types... 
The following list summarizes the types of KeyInfo and KeyValue that are defined in this section, that may be used within the Type attribute of RetrievalMethod and Reference elements to describe the referent key material. 
[ list 1 ] Existing paragraph: In addition to the types above... [ list 2 ] I don't really like the 4-line paragraph above, and it forward-references KeyValue and RetrievalMethod; you might prefer some clearer explication. 
Also, sticking those three existing paragraphs together triplicates the articulation that keying information may be brought in from external namespaces. 
But that is really of minor concern.

Your examples aren't truly MINOR nitpicks. 
Having just reread section 4.4 and approved of its recent changes, I have some. 
In the first paragraph after the numbered list in section 4.4.4, some text reads "MUST refer to the certificiate (sic) or certificates ...", which should be fixed. 
Two paragraphs later, the word "terminates" is misspelled as "termiantes". 
Furthermore, in the sample KeyInfo, the intermediate cert subject is missing a comma ("OU=FVTO=IBM" should be "OU=FVT,O=IBM") and the delimiter between the word "issuer" and its DN should be a space rather than a comma for consistency. 
In section 4.4.6, there are some similarly trivial problems. 
The expression "at least" is missing a space between its component words, and the phrase "replaced all-together" should probably be "replaced altogether" or even "replaced entirely".
