<s> I have just had a look on section 4.3.3.2 (The Reference Processing Model), and I have the following question: The second bullet in the list describing the default behaviour of a Transform's behaviour with respect to the input they require:  </s>
<s> "* If the data object is a node-set and the next transform requires octets, the signature application MUST attempt to convert the node-set to an octet stream using the specified canonicalization algorithm."  </s>
<s> I think that it is not clear what "THE SPECIFIED CANONICALIZATION ALGORITHM" means.  </s>
<s> If the intention is to use the c14n algorithm specified in the CanonicalizationAlgorithm element within SignedInfo, this should be clearly expressed in a sentence like "... to an octet stream using the canonicalization algorithm specified for canonicalizing the SignedInfo element.".  </s>

<s> This paragraph tells: "If the data object is a node-set and the next transform requires octets, the signature application MUST attempt to convert the node-set to an octet stream using Canonical XML [XML-C14N]" Ok, but c14n with comments or without comments??? Best regards.  </s>

<s> Why, for conversion of the node-set to an octet-stream it needs to use c14 omit-comments and not with-comments?  </s>
<s> Regards.  </s>
<s> Gianni Sargentini.  </s>
<s> Because the WG decided that c14n omitting-comments is a REQUIRED algorithm and with-comments is not required, so an algorithm had to be used that MUST be implemented on any platform.  </s>
<s> Christian  </s>
<s> And if you really want the comments, you can insert an explicit c14n-with-comments transform.  </s>
