<s> - a lock is a resource (by definition: it's identified by a URI) - a lock token is a URI - one could identify LOCK with BINDing the lock token to the lock resource and UNLOCK with deleting the lock token, and that wouldn't affect the basic functionality of shared locks However, the difference is that if we have a 1-1 relation between lock tokens and lock resources, each lock will have it's own timeout value and owner, and I think this is what's implemented in moddav and IIS.  </s>
