<s> Hi Janet, As pubrules are under discussion, I'd like to raise the matter of the errata link in RECs.  </s>
<s> A couple of months ago, it was proposed that this be moved into the "header", rather than stay buried in the SoTD section.  </s>
<s> I forget where it was discussed, but there appeared to be consensus to make this change.  </s>
<s> I see that it has not been implemented, eg: What is the next step?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Misha  </s>
<s> Hi, Charles.  </s>
<s> Thanks for this clarifying suggestion for pubrules.  </s>
<s> As for explanations; Pubrules is owned by the W3C Communications Team - to the person, our Webmaster implements these, and I sign the document.  </s>
<s> Changes in Pubrules are suggested at times by Working Groups and at times by the W3C Team.  </s>
<s> These suggestions are discussed by the W3C Communications Team, and we come to consensus on what changes to make to Pubrules, if any.  </s>
<s> When we decide on a change, we post an announcement to Chairs.  </s>
<s> We describe the change, and notify the Working Groups that there is a "grace" period of 30 days.  </s>
<s> That is to say, in thirty days time, the change is concretized.  </s>
<s> In that thirty day period, compliance to the change is encouraged, but non-compliance is not penalized.  </s>
<s> I hope I got the gist of your question.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if I can provide more clarity.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Janet  </s>
<s> The process for requesting a publication date is ... Publication requests should be sent to webreq@w3.org  </s>
<s> (archive) and w3t-comm@w3.org  </s>
<s> (archive)... -- http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules  </s>
<s> I suggest that this should be a must, for the sake of clarity.  </s>
<s> I would also like it to be a lot clearer how changes to the policy are decided, and how notice of them will be propogated, in particular to the people who have to comply with them.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell there have been messages to the list saying that things have changed, but there is no assurance that will happen.  </s>
<s> I don't wannt to overburden the process, but it is helpful to have some clarity about who is responsible and who is expecting information to come to them.  </s>
<s> cheers Charles  </s>

<s> Hi Misha, The Comm Team has decided to go ahead with this, but has not announced the change to pubrules yet.  </s>
<s> I would rather Janet do this, but she is on the road today.  </s>
<s> Susan or Dom, can you propose text here and we can just ask Janet to sign off on it?  </s>

<s> That discussion[3][4] led to the sample Rec[1] being modified.  </s>
<s> It now shows a compact way of adding not only errata, but also translations and alternative formats in the head.  </s>
<s> But it is true that the sample is two clicks away from the pubrules[2].  </s>
<s> Ian promised that somebody from the comm team would change the text, so, while waiting for that, I just added a direct link to the sample Rec.  </s>
