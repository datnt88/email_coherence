<s> Hi Karl and Joseph, Thanks for the clarification Karl.  </s>
<s> However, it was not the intent of XPath transforms to create something that was unusable.  </s>
<s> I would classify your results as demonstrating that the current formulation is, in a practical sense, unusable.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, it is not a goal of the standards process to be so concerned about release dates that we fail to fix something that is very obviously broken.  </s>
<s> I am disappointed that this did not come up sooner.  </s>
<s> I don't think the problem rests entirely with the fact that we visit every node of the document.  </s>
<s> It may be that this is a slow operation with current implementations of XPath, but in XFDL this is how our current signature filters work, and our results are in the fraction of a second range-- just like your XPointer results.  </s>
<s> However, if there is no way to get the XPath transform as currently designed to have fraction of a second performance on, say, a 100k XML document, then we need to return this specification to CR and redesign the XPath transform into something that we can actually recommend.  </s>
<s> At the very beginning of this process, I recommended a design similar to the XFDL filter that was very quickly vetoed (verbally).  </s>
<s> I will describe it below, but in defense of the group, I would point out that it was vetoed because it seemed possible to say everything using our current design rather than the design I first mentioned.  </s>
<s> However, our results must be both possible and practical, lest the result be not work recommending.  </s>
<s> The XFDL design specifies subtree roots *and* uses one of two keywords: keep or omit.  </s>
<s> If you say 'keep', then the subtrees specified are the ones kept by the signature filter.  </s>
<s> If you say 'omit', then the entire document except the specified subtrees are omitted.  </s>
<s> With that, I would  </s>
<s> propose a different XPath transform that has the following content model (expressed in XML examples): and where expr is an XPath expression that indicates a node-set S. The context of the expr is the root node of the octet stream or node-set passed as input.  </s>
<s> If the 'keep' parameter is used, then the output would be a node-set O containing the elements of S plus all elements, namespaces and attributes with an ancestor in S (i.e. S indicates a set of subtrees to include in the output).  </s>
<s> If the 'omit' parameter is used, then the output would be the node-set of the entire document less the node-set O that would be constructed for the keep parameter.  </s>
<s> I understand that there may be a process delay, but there is little point in having such a protracted process leading up to recommendation if we cannot fix things that are very badly broken from a practical standpoint.  </s>
<s> The above design has been working for PureEdge for years now, it has the desired run-time profile, and will not take implementers more than a few days to fix (plus a bit of extra admin time to change posted examples to deal with a different namespace).  </s>
<s> We really need to do this if software implementations are to meet all of DSig's requirements.  </s>
<s> It is utterly impossible to perform server-side validation if each one takes a couple of seconds.  </s>

<s> if you carefully design you system, you do not even need anything else. of course, one can create super-funky-complex signing schemes, but who really needs these things when you can realize it with a simple solution?  </s>
<s> A. Presently we say be careful with XPointers in URIs because of implementation issues: XPointer is not widely implemented, not yet REC, and we don't quite trust consistent application interpretations of fragment identifiers.  </s>
<s> Should we relax the discouragement of XPointer?  </s>

<s> an earlier version of the Xerces parser had problems handling XPointers in URIs, but it was simple to fix.  </s>
<s> anyway, if they would have implemented their URI class according to the URI specification, it wouldn't have been a problem at all.  </s>
<s> i did not see a complete XPointer implementation yet.  </s>
<s> i searched for one last year, when i needed XPointer first.  </s>
<s> i did not find one easily, so i cxonsidered to implement this part of XPointer which 'makes sense'; i.e. just the XPath related stuff, but not any of these features like selecting parts of text, ranges, .... these features might be of use for text-processing systems but not really for data-processing systems which use XML to encode structured data.  </s>
<s> referencing elements by IDs, i would discourage.  </s>
<s> if you use IDs, you cannot extract signed content from one document and combine it with other signed parts into a new document.  </s>
<s> you might get ID clashes, which you cannot fix, because the IDs are covered by the signatures.  </s>
<s> one would break the signatures in renameing the IDs.  </s>
<s> i would not discourage XPointer in general.  </s>
<s> it is similar as for other standards.  </s>
<s> a fraction of this standard is useful for the majority of its users, but a good portion is "i am wondering who really needs this".  </s>
<s> experience?) B. Specify a new XPath transform that is at least very fast for subtree selection and hopefully faster for omission filters -- I'm not sure how to do the latter yet.  </s>
<s> if you design a new transform, i would recommend to specify one which allows to specify a complete sub-tree with all attributes and namespace nodes.  </s>
<s> i guess this is the most important type of reference required.  </s>
<s> omission filters, i do not use any longer.  </s>
<s> i jsut used them to exclude the own signature during signing, but with the type of XPointer references i use now, i do not need this omission filter any longer.  </s>
<s> i think i could live without this omission filters, because i cannot imagine a reasonable other use-case for them.  </s>
<s> who needs a filter like "just sign all attributes which's name is ..."?  </s>
<s> 3. Since the enveloped signature transform is specified via an XPath expression (though it is not required to be the means of implementing it) how do you implement that and how is its performance?  </s>
<s> the signature is never part of the signed document.  </s>
<s> consequently, i structure my documents that this is really the case.  </s>
<s> this means, the signature is never the descendant of any of its signed elements.  </s>
<s> in my use-case the signature is a sibling of the signed content, if it is inside the same document.  </s>
<s> and if the signature is detached, there is no problem anyway.  </s>
<s> putting all singed data into the Object element of a signature and then signing the complete document excluding the signature itself, is "not a nice design" putting it mildly.  </s>
<s> to sum up: using XPointers instead of XPath filters was a good decision with hindsight.  </s>
<s> using an uncritical subset of XPointer, this which is just a different notation for XPath expressions, is really woth the effort. the effort to implement this subset of XPointer that you really need is little, if you already have a XPath preocessor.  </s>
<s> this was one Java class with ~200 lines of code in my case.  </s>

<s> John, this sounds like a good technical approach.  </s>
<s> As I've mentioned before, I don't think cycling in our current dual/over-extended process is the right timing/process approach.  </s>
<s> Regardless, if you're willing to do the work (and it sounds like this issue has the attention of the implementors) I'd suggest writing up a draft as we did with exc-c14n.  </s>
<s> Moving an external document is much easier with respect to focus, process, and attention then trying to address a problem in the larger document.  </s>
