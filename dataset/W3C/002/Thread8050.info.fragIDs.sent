<s> Clients currently have no reliable means of forcing the server to authenticate them (they can try to preemptively send credentials, but this works only for basic auth, not for digest).  </s>
<s> This can lead to situations where the client finds out that it was required to authenticate too late and only after doing lots of work, such as when putting a large file only to get a 401 back at the end of the transfer.  </s>
<s> To address this problem, it was proposed to add a Force-Authenticate OPTIONS header which would force a compliant server to issue an authentication challenge to the client, a la: Force-Authenticate = "Force-Authenticate" ":" ("T" | "F") The Force-Authenticate header would be used with the OPTIONS method to specify that the client wants to be challenged for authentication credentials to the resource identified by the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> A value of "T"  </s>
<s> indicates that a compliant DAV server MUST respond with a 401 Unauthorized status code (see [RFC2068], section 10.4.2) if the resource identified by the Request-URI is protected, i.e., there exists a DAV method (read, write, or otherwise) that may result in a 401 response for this Request-URI.  </s>
<s> Put another way, if the server does *not* respond with a 401, it is guaranteeing to the client that any DAV operation it may want to apply to the Request-URI will not return a 401.  </s>
<s> This means that the client has a way of finding out beforehand whether it needs credentials to perform an operation, and the server has the option of saying "no credentials necessary" if it is sure that in fact no credentials are necessary (for example, servers that have no access control at all, if any such exist).  </s>
<s> I thought it was important to keep this option open, although I suspect that most servers would always want to challenge since they couldn't really be sure.  </s>
<s> Comments?  </s>

<s> I think this thread is diverging a bit from the key aspects of the proposal to use the If header instead of inventing a new header.  </s>
<s> In particular, suppose a client used the new header.  </s>
<s> This request will fail against every existing DAV server.  </s>
<s> Suppose instead the client used the If header, using the: If ("a" Not "a") form.  </s>
<s> This request will do what is desired against every existing DAV server that: - supports the If header (correctly) and that - does any authentication checks before the If checks.  </s>
<s> For all new DAV servers, they can equally well either implement a new header, or could implement the If header (which they should do anyway), and make sure they do any authentication checks before the If check (which they should do anyway).  </s>
<s> I believe it is clear that it provides increased interoperability to use the If header approach, since this provides at least some interoperability with existing servers, while the new header (or new anything) approach does not.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> First, I bet that 100% of all non-broken, existing servers do authentication checks before looking at the request resource and its properities like locks.  </s>
<s> It's the sensible thing to do, as a user might not even have read permission on the resource.  </s>
<s> So one probably should prevent him/her from finding out about the lock status of the resource.  </s>
<s> No, and why should they?  </s>
<s> There's nothing in RFC2518 that requires servers to support locks only for authenticated users.  </s>
<s> If a resource is publicly writable, there may be nothing to prevent unauthenticated users from taking out locks and using lock tokens.  </s>
<s> Recall that the If header can also be used with ETags, which are not at all associated with how a user is authenticated.  </s>
<s> Also, recall that in order to "do authentication checks", the server must respond to the client with a 401 with the WWW-Authenticate header, then the client must make another request.  </s>
<s> Of course if the client sent its authentication information on the first request, the server is likely to check it.  </s>
<s> However, the client can't even send its authentication information if it doesn't yet know whether the server supports digest or basic, or what realm, nonce, etc.  </s>
<s> That's why Ilya wants to be able to ask the server to reply with a WWW-Authenticate header.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> the fact that this may already work with some implementations is a plus.  </s>
<s> on the other hand it would pretty much be a hack.  </s>
<s> when i see something like If: ("a" Not "a"), client authentication is not exactly the first thing that comes to mind.  </s>
<s> a new header would make this idea very explicit and probably less prone to implementation errors.  </s>
<s> however, i'd like to see this feature implemented in some shape or form, so if there's consensus on the If header, it'd be fine with me.  </s>
