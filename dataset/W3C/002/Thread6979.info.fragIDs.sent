<s> Dear all, My name is Juan Carlos Cruellas and I am involved in a work dealing with electronic signature formats.  </s>
<s> ETSI has issued its standard TS 101 733 "Electronic Signature Format" which defines a format for electronic  </s>
<s> signatures valid in the long term (by usage of timestamping techniques).  </s>
<s> The core format is based on the CMS structure defined in the RFC 2630, with the adition of a number of what in CMS document are known as signed and unsigned attributes (additional information qualifying the digital signature for people familiar with XML terminology).  </s>
<s> At the same time, ETSI, being aware of the growing importance of XML syntax and of the works dealing with digital signature in XML, expressed its interest in having something similar to its electronic signature but in XML syntax.  </s>
<s> ETSI launched a work whose final objective is to define new XML types able to contain identical information (semantically speaking) to the information contained in the new ASN.1 structures defined in the ETSI document.  </s>
<s> The results of this work will be then, new XML types whose data can be incorporated to the XML digital signature structure defined by the W3c/IETF digital signature group.  </s>
<s> We, at the UPC, are in charge of the editorial work of this specification, and there have been produced a number of drafts.  </s>
<s> The reason for send you this e-mail is related with the following problem: In ASN.1 the usual way for identifying, let's say a Policy for signature, is an OID.  </s>
<s> In XML, identification and reference of objects is made using URIs.  </s>
<s> So the problem appears when one treats of incorporating information of an OID in an XML document by converting it in a special form of an URI.  </s>
<s> ETSI thinks that this is a very generic topic where both sides, ASN.1 people and XML people will likely have something to say.  </s>
<s> The alternatives raised up to now are: 1.  </s>
<s> The draft being produced by Michael Melling (draft-mealling-oid-urn-...) where the proposal is made of representing OIDs as URNs, leading to something like: urn:oid:1.3.6.1 2. A URL with a fixed a base and appended the OID in an human readable format:  </s>
<s> e.g.,  </s>
<s> ic-signature-standard(1733)/part1(1)/idupMechanism(4)/etsiESv1(1)  </s>
<s> 3. As an URN but with the human readable text included: urn:oid:itu-t(0)/identified-organization(4)/etsi(0)/electronic-signature-sta ndard(1733)/part1(1)/idupMechanism(4)/etsiESv1(1)  </s>
<s> These three proposals have been discussed among several people in the XML digital signature group, ETSI group, and the group that works in the production of the RFC draft and different views have been expressed.  </s>
<s> Concerns on possible mismatching between numbers and text in the representation with text, have been raised.  </s>
<s> In the same direction, it has been said that automatic processing is facilitated if only numbers appear.... But human readibility have been argued as a critery supporting the incorporation of the text.  </s>
<s> Besides the former, the issue raised by approaches 2 and 3 is the identification of the organization "in charge" of the OID, which is repeated.  </s>
<s> Arguments against these repetitions have also been raised...  </s>
<s> It is our intention, by sending this e-mail to ask your opinion on this issue, in order to get a major number of views and take, in the end, a better decision.  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for your time and interest.  </s>
<s> Best regards.  </s>

<s> Howdy, This is perhaps a good time to point out that there is a maximum length of URIs.  </s>
<s> Whether it's de jure (can't find the reference just this minute) or de facto, URIs of longer than 255 characters will cause problems.  </s>
<s> Which sort of argues for the URN:OID proposal from Michael Mealling, of the 3 you have outlined, since (apart from anything else) the ones with "human readable" components seem capable of being quite expansive.  </s>

<s> It is desirable to avoid new XML types unless the type is really different.  </s>
<s> The criteria for when you have a novel type vs. just appearing in a new location are different.  </s>
<s> This is a domain analysis issue which affects your total XML usage profile.  </s>
<s> This can be separated, a bit, from the smaller question of how to identify a resource (the signature-related policy) in URI-conformant form within this XML application profile.  </s>
<s> You may view the task before you as a special case of schema mapping as used for data mediation.  </s>
<s> An example approach supported by running code is discussed in http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/get/SIDL-WP-1999-0126  </s>
<s> http://www-di glib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/get/SIDL-WP-1999-0126  </s>
<s> It sounds as though one approach here could be to start with one mapping at the level of CMS to XML Schema.  </s>
<s> Then use XML Schema to derive the ETSI signature-in-XML practice (presuming it is actually more restrictive than the general XML signature practice) as a mutual specialization of the ETSI-signature specialization of CMS and the XML-Signature target environment types.  </s>
<s> You have both problems.  </s>
<s> Yes, in XML all you are basically required to do is to represent the policy identity in some scheme conforming to the general requirements for URIs.  </s>
<s> That is all that XML per se requires of you.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, you do need to survey your user community for what operations on "policy on which signature depends" need to be supported consistently and interoperably.  </s>
<s> The OID-using community needs to form their own consensus a) that they want a URI-conforming transliteration or representation for OIDs and b) how much they wish to standardize this and how (numbers vs. expanded form, etc.).  </s>
<s> However, you also have the problem in the ASN.1-based usage pattern of how to deal with policies identified by any URI, and not just the OID-identified policies.  </s>
<s> You need to expand this to ASN.1 people, XML people, and URI people.  </s>
<s> It is important to distinguish what aspects of this design problem are properly in the purview of which group to hold the ultimate decision power on.  </s>
<s> format:  </s>
<s> -organization(4)/etsi(0)/electron  </s>
<s> This is IMHO significantly less than the highest and best use of the URI space.  </s>
<s> The OID using community has the option of pursuing recognition (using the standard IETF scheme recognition processes) for either a sub-scheme of urn: as proposed by Mealling or a top-level scheme parallel to URN.  </s>
<s> But using the one does an HTTP GET on it, is going to generate more heat than light and should be avoided.  </s>
<s> The point is that the information model for OIDs defines the number form and the text form as synonyms.  </s>
<s> So it is not a question of picking which one you use in a URI scheme.  </s>
<s> The service that you offer to the "policy publisher" is broken if someone wishing to follow the policy cannot easily move back and forth between the two synonymous forms of identification defined in the OID pattern of practice.  </s>
<s> The reference model for your security architecture should include a model (a schema of [possibly virtual] data) which defines this synonym relationship and the rules for each variant form.  </s>
<s> This synonym relationship between variant data forms must also be covered by conversion services in order for the alternative pattern not to break the application of policies in the signature practice.  </s>
<s> The pattern of practice that you have to standardize among those using OIDs to identify policy descriptions that signatures will depend on has to be broader than just one data representation.  </s>
<s> The appropriate bundle to standardize is an "application profile," a bundle of representations and services which assures a healthy life-cycle for the identification of the policy document and its reference and recovery as appropriate.  </s>
<s> What is the existing best current practice for moving back and forth between numeric and textual forms of OIDs?  </s>
<s> Is this service part of the standards profile of what to implement with regard to the proposed ASN.1-based security services?  </s>
<s> Is it [like LDAP] already covered with URI-conformant service identification forms of reference?  </s>
<s> If humans don't have access to the human information of "whose policy are you following" then the system is broken.  </s>
<s> Human interpretation of the context of policy on which the signature depends is a valid requirement, and the ASN.1-based signature application profile should support it well.  </s>
<s> This does not [by virtue of logic] have to be satisfied by putting the human-comprehensible information in the data of the XML signature block.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if current OID use policies allow for the use of the text form with the numeric form as an ad_lib alternative, this (signature practice) may not be the place to standardize on numbers.  </s>
<s> If OID doctrine says that numbers are the standard and text synonyms are a permitted alternative, then you have to think twice before breaking this OID tradition.  </s>
<s> You may well have internationalization or canonicalization problems with respect to the longer forms of the OIDs, but this is a small matter of programming, and there are resources in the canonicalization methods associated with XML signature and the work on internationalization of URIs that may be of assistance.  </s>
<s> This is a decision to be worked out by the OID using community.  </s>
<s> One option is to decide, in signature practice, to standardize on the numeric form of OIDs.  </s>
<s> In this case, it is important that there be services which are highly available that allow one to trace back from numeric OIDs to text OIDs and human readable representations of the policies.  </s>
<s> This is a problem wired into the logical definition of the OIDs.  </s>
<s> There are logically two questions, and they need to be separated.  </s>
<s> 1) If the publisher of the policy wishes to identify their policy by an OID, how to provide for URI-conformant expression of this identification suitable for use in XML and 2) Given all URI-conformant forms of identification, which will be equally acceptable to XML, do policy publishers really wish to always identify their policies via the OID route?  </s>
<s> [major IMHO disclaimer] I would be thinking of setting up the model of what the information is you actually capture in the OID dictionary, and be preparing to deal with any form of identification which succeeds in reproducing this information.  </s>
<s> The binding from information fields to OID path order may in fact be introducing constraints that you would like to get out from under eventually.  </s>
<s> You will probably be under pressure, if you decide to remove the redundant reference to the congnizant organization, to demonstrate a reference implementation of all relevant transforms.  </s>
<s> This doesn't seem like a serious technical risk if you develop the binding in a schema-based environment.  </s>
<s> An excellent move.  </s>
<s> I would also encourage you or someone on your team to monitor what is going on in the security and information services working groups in the Global Grid Forum http:// http://www.gridforum.org/  </s>
<s> www.gridforum.org/ .  </s>
<s> They have the same general problem and may have valuable ideas to contribute to a solution or may be good customers for what you work out.  </s>
