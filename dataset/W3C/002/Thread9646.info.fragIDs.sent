<s> I think that the union treatment of rdfs:drange does this nicely.  </s>
<s> Consider the following example, including all *four* datatyping idioms (inline, value triple, doublet, and datatype triple): ppp rdfs:drange xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> aaa ppp "10" .  </s>
<s> bbb ppp _:1 .  </s>

<s> ccc ppp _:2 .  </s>
<s> _:2 rdfs:dlex "10" .  </s>
<s> _:2 rdfs:dtype xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> eee ppp _:3 .  </s>
<s> _:3 xsd:integer "10" .  </s>
<s> All of the above idioms define the pairing ("10",xsd:integer) which unambiguously denotes the integer value 'ten'.  </s>
<s> The property value of ppp is either a member of the lexical space (literal) or member of the value space (bNode) and the graph syntax makes it crystal clear which partition of the union the  </s>
<s> actual property value corresponds to; with no conflict nor confusion of the global range typing for any of the idioms.  </s>

<s> ? unions aren't partitioned, that is precisely the problem.  </s>
<s> A union is just a big set that contains everything in all the other sets.  </s>
<s> Think of mixing two colors of sand.  </s>
<s> So if the datatype class is this union, then a range statement refers to the entire union, which hardly restricts the datatyping at all.  </s>
<s> Also, some datatypes (eg some date formatting) may have value spaces which overlap lexical spaces of others, which would produce even more confusion when unions were formed.  </s>
