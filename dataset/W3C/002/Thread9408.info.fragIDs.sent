<s> That doesn't work.  </s>
<s> If it entails that, then it must also entail: _:b rdf:type rdf:Bag.  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:_1 "abc".  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:_2 "def".  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:_2 "abc".  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:_1 "def".  </s>
<s> so just saying 'can be permuted' isn't enough.  </s>

<s> I had assumed that: aaa rdf:type rdf:Bag .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_NNN bbb .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_MMM ccc .  </s>
<s> = aaa rdf:_MMM bbb .  </s>
<s> where aaa is a bNode or URI and bbb, ccc are anything.  </s>

<s> I don't think that works.  </s>
<s> Consider a bag {* "aaa" "bbb" "bbb" *} The 3^2=9 edges would be: aaa rdf:_1 "aaa" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_2 "aaa" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_3 "aaa" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> But, on removing duplicates, which the MT tells us are redundant: aaa rdf:_1 "aaa" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_2 "aaa" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_3 "aaa" .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .  </s>
<s> Now does that bag contain 2 "aaa"s and 1 "bbb", or 1 "aaa" and 2 "bbb"s, or something else?  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>
<s> Ah. OK, that would work, as long as one doesn't think that aaa rdf:_NNN bbb .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:_NNN ccc . is a contradiction.  </s>
<s> However, the other problem remains, that there seems to be no way to distinguish a bag from a set.  </s>
<s> For example, if the bag [aaa aaa bbb] has both aaa and bbb in every position, then how does it differ from the bag [aaa bbb] ?  </s>
<s> They both have bbb in the second place.  </s>
