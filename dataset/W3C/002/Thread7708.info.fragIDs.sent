Finally this is available for you to peruse. 
Note that this is a proposal for a set of OPTIONAL properties that make it easier to do client-side GUIs for DAV. 
Lisa A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories. 
Title: Additional WebDAV Collection Properties Author(s): A. Hopmann, L. Lippert Filename: draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt 
Pages: 5 The WebDAV protocol defines a basic set of properties that should be understood by all DAV servers. 
This document defines a small set of additional properties that are very useful for displaying navigation interfaces for WebDAV enabled web sites. 
A URL for this Internet-Draft is: Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. 
Login with the username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. 
After logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then "get draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt". 
A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail. 
Send a message to: mailserv@ietf.org. 
In the body type: "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt". 
NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility. 
To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command. 
To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader. 
Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages. 
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft. 
greetings; Is the nature and behaviour of structured documents specified at any other place in webdav specs? 
I note the term for the first time in "1.7 The isstructureddocument Property". 
Just to check, I went back through "draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-10" and find that the word "structured" appears in generic or colloquial senses only and that there is neither a description of the content nor one of the behaviour of such a resource. 
If this document (draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt) is the only place where the term appears, then a more extensive definition and a distinction between structured documents and generic collections are necessary. 
for instance, is the intended hierarchy collection structured-document directory or is it collection structured-document directory Note that I very much welcome the introduction of s-d's as specialized collections, as webdav, in its present form, is a bit fixated on "directories / folders" as the only collection forms. 
Where, for example, I would like to consider a patient record to be a special form of collection, I'd be stretching the present spec. 
on the other hand I can't express enough if I try to model them as generic resources. 
bye, 
I agree that if we tackle this problem, we should use existing tools for implementation if possible. 
MIME is certainly a candidate to be taken seriously. 
I see compound documents as a conceptual layer on top of WebDAV collections or MIME multipart or ... 
The practical problem with layering like this is that you can't actually vary the lower layers and still keep interoperability. 
How many implementations of HTTP, or SMTP, have you seen that were not running over TCP? 
It could be done, but the resulting software would be limited to a small island of connectivity. 
Similarly, if a compound document spec just specifies the concepts, and leaves the representation up to implementers, then we don't have interop. 
Whatever working group addresses this problem may want to layer the spec conceptually, but they should make sure they specify a recommended representation, too. 
Otherwise we'll all be stuck using different representations, and we'll have chaos until everybody migrates to whatever representation Microsoft decides to build into Office. 
(No offense meant. 
Microsoft *might* spontaneously come up with the best of all possible protocols; but the point of standards bodies is to make sure we don't have to rely on them to do so.) |John Stracke | My opinions are my own |S/MIME &amp; HTML OK | |francis@appoint.net|==========================================|
