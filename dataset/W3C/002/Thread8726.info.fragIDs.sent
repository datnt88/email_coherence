I would like to discuss again the following problem regarding the (lack of) expressiveness of the DTD content model of XML 1.0: In our "Object" element (and in some other places) we allow any well-formed XML element, which need not essentially be defined in the grammar given by the XML document's corresponding DTD. 
But how should we express this "freedom" with the limited means of the DTD content model for an element? 
* (#PCDATA) limits the allowed content of the element to character data only; no tags are allowed. 
* (ANY) limits the allowed content to any elements DEFINED WITHIN the DTD; so this is also too restrictive. 
In opposition to these restrictions, XML Schema allwows us to declare exactly the content model we have in mind by using the any wildcard 
element (see [1]). 
Possible solutions (?): * Skip DTD definitions and only use Schema definitions (very radical suggestion, I have to admit) * Incorporate some clarification into the draft that our intended content model for "Object" (and some others) cannot be expressed by the limited means of XML DTDs, but only the approximation which can be currently found in our DTD definitions. 
(I have seen a red-colored sentence in the introductional part of the 18022000 draft, but it has been removed again; cf [2]) In any case, I think (ANY) would be a better approximation than (#PCDATA), which is currenlty used.

I was thinking #PCDATA might be the better route, I didn't like the sentence that we interpret what ANY means as it is clearly defined by the XML spec. 
However, I'm not convinced this is the right choice, this is something I hope we get more feedback on. 
Regardless, a validator [1] will fail on examples of either case. 
[2] is an example where there is mixed content in a Signature Method with the #PCDATA version of the DTD; [3] is the same example using ANY. 
Both cause errors ... [1] http://www.stg.brown.edu/service/xmlvalid/
