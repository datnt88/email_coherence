<s> Could someone set me straight on whether WebDAV makes any committment about  </s>

<s> Is the proper term 'empty' resource or 'null' resource, by the way?  </s>
<s> And where is it defined?  </s>
<s> In RFC 2068?  </s>

<s> about  </s>
<s> We don't explicitly permit this operation in the -07 spec.  </s>
<s> because if you  </s>
<s> create properties on a null resource, that resource becomes non-null, and  </s>
<s> then has a body as well.  </s>
<s> This creates an awkward situation where there is  </s>
<s> a non-null resource without a content type.  </s>
<s> To set properties on a null resource, first do a PUT with a Content-Type header and a zero length body,  </s>
<s> creating a resource with a known content type, and an empty body.  </s>
<s> Then, perform a PROPPATCH on this empty resource.  </s>
<s> We've been trying to distinguish between an empty resource (zero length), and a null resource (what happens after a delete).  </s>
<s> This is not defined primarily to avoid stepping into the pit called "defining the HTTP object model".  </s>
<s> I don't believe RFC 2068 defines "null" resource.  </s>
<s> One awkward question that would need to be addressed to define "null resource" is this: since methods are invoked on resources, what entity  </s>
<s> generates a 404 (Not Found) message for a particular URI when that URI  </s>
<s> identifies a non-existent (or null) resource?  </s>
<s> Also, what entity returns a 200 (OK) after a successful DELETE?  </s>
<s> These are interesting questions, however, I don't think the DA spec. is well-served by trying to answer them, since these answers do not generate extra interoperability.  </s>
<s> However, I do think that someone should address these concerns, but in a different forum than an interoperability specification.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Roy Fielding will in his Ph.D. dissertation.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I would like you to clarify this, so there is no doubt.  </s>
<s> It should be either explicitly forbidden, explicitly allowed ('may'), or explicitly required.  </s>
<s> At the very least, it should explicitly be left undefined, which  </s>
<s> would serve as a warning to the cautious not to rely upon it.  </s>
<s> I had been assuming for weeks that it *was* supported, because LOCK seems to rely on it.  </s>
<s> My server supports it, and I've written client code that relies on it.  </s>
<s> Naturally I'll change my code to comply with the standard, but I want the standard to be clear on the point.  </s>
<s> So. Are you saying that a PROPPATCH on a null resource MUST fail (with a 404)?  </s>
<s> I would be the first to admint that making such support mandatory would be  </s>
<s> a burden on implementors, at least those implementing on a file system.  </s>
<s> It  </s>
<s> was a pain for me, that's for sure.  </s>
<s> Another clarifiction question: 6.3 says that a write lock on a null resource makes the resource act "in all ways as a null resource, except that it MUST respond to a PROPFIND request".  </s>
<s> This raises two questions  </s>
<s> 1. What about the collection that contains it?  </s>
<s> In particular does the null resource appear in its list of members if one does a PROPFIND of non-zero Depth?  </s>
<s> 2. What about PROPPATCH?  </s>
<s> Does that work?  </s>
<s> Oh, and I know it's picky, but shouldn't UNLOCK also be included in the list of requests it must support?  </s>
<s> yours in seeking clarity  </s>
<s> Jim  </s>
<s> Again, my apologies for the slow response.  </s>
<s> These are excellent questions, thank you for posting them!  </s>

<s> is  </s>
<s> body,  </s>
<s> which  </s>
<s> Yes. We need to add language to Section 7.2.1 to explicitly state that a 404 response MUST be returned after performing a PROPPATCH on a null resource.  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that Yaron is also working on a definition of a null resource for inclusion in the draft to help avoid confusion about what constitutes a null resource.  </s>
<s> I believe the definition will be mostly operational to avoid some of the definitional difficulties I mentioned in a previous email.  </s>
<s> be  </s>
<s> It  </s>
<s> Sounds like a good reason not to have it in the spec.  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> I just knew questions like this were lurking beneath this seemingly innocent-looking feature :-)  </s>
<s> Yes, a locked, null resource does appear in the list of members if one does a PROPFIND of non-zero depth on a parent resource, to provide a discovery mechanism to find locked, null resources.  </s>
<s> Section 6.3 will be amended to explicitly mention this behavior.  </s>
<s> No, because if you were allowed to PROPPATCH, this would add state to the resource beyond that state automatically created by the LOCK.  </s>
<s> This non-LOCK-created state should presumably be kept around after an UNLOCK, which is at odds with the current definition that an UNLOCK of a locked null resource reverts the resource back to its null state.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Hopefully yours in providing clarity.  </s>
