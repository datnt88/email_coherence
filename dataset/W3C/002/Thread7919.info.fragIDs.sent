<s> I'm interested in the list's thoughts on two ideas for DAV improvements: The first is to introduce a GETSRC method to support access to the unprocessed source of a resource.  </s>
<s> This would decouple the dynamic response of a resource (GET) from its static source (GETSRC).  </s>
<s> The second is to introduce the MULTIPUT method to support "PUT with PROPPATCH" scenarios.  </s>
<s> MULTIPUT would accept some subset of multipart MIME packages and atomically write them to the server.  </s>
<s> This would support the update of a resource and its metadata in one transaction.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> From: Jim Whitehead [mailto:ejw@cse.ucsc.edu]  </s>
<s> These are very good questions.  </s>
<s> One possible set of answers:  </s>
<s> In general, I believe having distinct URL's for different resources is far superior to defining new methods.  </s>
<s> How would you set access control on the "source" resource?  </s>
<s> The dav:readsrc privilege.  </s>
<s> Since it is likely that the privileges for the "source" resource will be very different from those on the "non-source" resource, I'll also need a dav:writesrc, etc, effectively doubling the privilege space, just so that the server can avoid allocating a new URL to the source resource?  </s>
<s> In many cases, there actually will already be a separate URL (e.g. a /xxx.jsp resource which generates the /xxx.html  </s>
<s> file).  </s>
<s> Also, what about PUT?  </s>
<s> Is an authoring client going to do a PUT to /xxx.html in .jsp  </s>
<s> format, and then a GET will return something in .html  </s>
<s> format?  </s>
<s> Then what happens when a naive client tries to PUT something in .html  </s>
<s> format to /xxx.html, and then get some unexpected error message (or even worse, the html file will just overwrite the .jsp  </s>
<s> resource and generate strange errors at the next GET).  </s>
<s> Looks like we probably should have a PUTSRC, to match the GETSRC.  </s>
<s> How would you get the properties of the "source" resource?  </s>
<s> In this model it's not a different resource, so you'd use PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> If you want information about the src, then dav:srccontentlength, dav:srcetag, dav:srccreationdate, dav:srclastmodified... properties would need to be defined.  </s>
<s> It probably would make more sense to just have a PROPFINDSRC.  </s>
<s> And probably a COPYSRC.  </s>
<s> And an xxxSRC for any new WebDAV method that could reasonably be applied to either the original resource or to the "source".  </s>
<s> I continue to believe that GETSRC (and its other xxxSRC friends) would be a very unfortunate direction to pursue.  </s>
<s> In particular, I think having the separate URL is a clear win for clients.  </s>
<s> I'd  </s>
<s> be interested in even a partially compelling story from the server vendors as to why they cannot generate additional URL's for the source resources (or in many cases, expose the source resource URL, when it already has its own URL).  </s>
<s> I'd much rather do nothing here, than do something wrong.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> No reason here other than "haven't spent time on it (yet)."  </s>
<s> I pretty much know how I'd do it -- there isn't any technical problem with it.  </s>
<s> One new directive and a little code to auto-generate the DAV:link property.  </s>
<s> If client were pushing for it, then I probably would have coded it already.  </s>
<s> Kind of a chicken and egg thing.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
