<s> Hello, I am trying to convert a HTML file to an XHTML using tidy.  </s>
<s> I am using the following commandline - tidy -asxhtml -o out.xhtml  </s>
<s> in.html  </s>
<s> This runs and gives out a lot of warnings and errors regarding unrecognised tags etc.  </s>
<s> But on windows, the out.xhtml  </s>
<s> file is created, whereas on linux, it just prints out the errors and warnings and quits.  </s>
<s> I downloaded the recent versions of tidy from http://tidy.sf.net  </s>
<s> What am I missing?  </s>
<s> TIA VaibhaV  </s>
<s> Have an example?  </s>

<s> Doh! It seems there was a change from the 15th to the 18th that fixed this bug.  </s>
<s> I usually don't update the windows binaries if the source changes in that little of time.  </s>
<s> I've uploaded new ones: http://tidy.int64.org  </s>

<s> Hello, I am not exactly sure about this.  </s>
<s> Did you update the windows binaries?  </s>
<s> I need to use the linux binaries which are not working as the windows binaries are.  </s>
<s> :D Thanks, VaibhaV  </s>

<s> The output file was created, but that's all- it was empty.  </s>
<s> If you read the output, tidy said there are errors you need to fix before it can continue.  </s>
<s> It also says what the errors are.  </s>
