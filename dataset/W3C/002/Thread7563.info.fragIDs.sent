<s> WebDAV replies are never intended for direct human viewing, right?  </s>
<s> Is there a reason then that the WebDAV spec uses text/xml and does not even mention application/xml?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the latter is closer to the intended use of WebDAV XML (as opposed to XML markup that's embedded in HTML).  </s>
<s> If this is right, the spec should say that a WebDAV server MUST accept both application/xml and text/xml, and MUST generate application/xml.  </s>
<s> Would this be good, aside from the fact that it would require change to some existing softwares?  </s>

<s> The IANA content type categorizations have never been particularly usefull wrt text.  </s>
<s> According to the rules html should have been  </s>
<s> application/html since it is not ascii text...  </s>
<s> I would recommend text/xml since if the DTD is declared a generic xml text viewer could well make a decent job at presenting the content and in general XML is aimed as a text markup language..  </s>

<s> There was never a requirement that text/* be ASCII.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, 'application/html' is more appropriate for HTML 4.0, because HTML now includes script tags and other processing elements that are not merely text and its annotations but program.  </s>
<s> I would favor the registration of application/html, however.  </s>
<s> Let's not compound the error by making it again.  </s>
<s> This is not a good argument; you could configure your system to view application/xml as well as text/xml.  </s>
<s> It's more of an issue of security considerations.  </s>
<s> I am puzzled why you say that.  </s>
<s> RFC 2046 section 4.1 says, of the text media type 'In the absence of appropriate interpretation software, it is  </s>
<s> reasonable to show subtypes of "text" to the user, while it is not reasonable to do so with most nontextual data.  </s>
<s> Such formatted textual data should be represented using subtypes of "text".' It seems to me HTML fits the criteria of being 'reasonable' to show to a user who lacks suitable interpretation software.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I very retro here, but I still edit HTML with Emacs, which displays only ASCII (sometimes Latin-1).  </s>
<s> I suppose by the same token the XML generated by WebDAV is also meaningful even without interpretation software, after all the WebDAV specification is full of examples which are supposed to be meaningful to humans.  </s>
<s> I am still confused about the distinction.  </s>
<s> RFC 2046 was written long after the decision was made.  </s>
<s> Tim was told to use application/html on various grounds but did not see any reason to break the installed base.  </s>
<s> As Larry points out HTML 4.0 now has imperative scripting gunk thrown in, the point is however that once you step beyond flat ascii plaintext people start saying application/*.  </s>
<s> The real problem is that the taxonomic classification is not quite as appropriate as it might appear.  </s>
