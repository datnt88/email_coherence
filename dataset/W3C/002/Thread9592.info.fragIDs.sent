<s> Guys, I have an urgent question.  </s>
<s> In a recent email, Peter P-S claimed the following:  </s>
<s> It appears to me that there is such a distinction in RDF graphs, and, moreover, both {  "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#_1" "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type" "http://www.w3.org/2001/01/rdf-schema#ContainerMembershipProperty"  } and {  "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#_01" "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type" "http://www.w3.org/2001/01/rdf-schema#ContainerMembershipProperty"  } are legal RDF graphs, only one of which is RDFS-entailed by the empty RDF graph.  </s>
<s> If Peter is right then we need to fix something; that is, either  </s>
<s> leading zeros in CMP names should be syntactically illegal, or else I need to tweak the RDFS semantics to make those CMP syntactic forms have their obvious meaning.  </s>
<s> I don't know for sure, however, if they are syntactically legal or not.  </s>
<s> Can anyone answer that question, please?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> My take on this: The namespace  </s>
<s> is controlled by W3C.  </s>
<s> We can say that it does contain the name _:1 and it  </s>
<s> does not contain the name _:01.  </s>
<s> I have never seen it suggested before that  </s>
<s> _:01 was legal.  </s>
<s> I suggest that we make it clear in the vocabulary document  </s>
<s> that it is not.  </s>

<s> In 1999, W3C published a recommendation that was all about the namespace  </s>
<s> called "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#".  </s>
<s> At that time W3C gave no hint  </s>
<s> that this namespace contained things named 'nodeID', 'datatype' etc.  </s>
<s> The spec was somewhat elusive on whether one could expect in the future for revelations about such things to be made.  </s>
<s> In 2001-3 we've revealed our view that there are other  </s>
<s> occupants of this namespace, ie. nodeID, datatype etc.  </s>
<s> I believe we need to decide whether to 'seal up' this namespace with the publication of our specs, or whether to allow the possibility that further occupants of the ns may be subsequently 'revealed'.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we can do this incrementally, by saying that the ns remains potentially open for future additions, but that we definitively assert that it doesn't contain anything with a name beginning with '_0'.  </s>
<s> In other words, we should decide whether we're claiming the RDF specs provide an exhaustive account of the things that are named in that namespace.  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> I think it's a reasonable and pragmatic approach to say that it doesn't contain names beginning "_0" (for reasons of possible confusion of container vocab.) without saying that the namespace is sealed for all time.  </s>
<s> Looking beyond that case, I suggest that it's probably appropriate to say as little as necessary about the future population of this (or any) namespace.  </s>
<s> Maybe it is more important to say what should be the expectations of any namespace used for RDF vocabulary (a kind of "cool URIrefs don't change" exhortation, maybe)?  </s>

<s> Thinking about it, things might not be that easy.  </s>
<s> May need a tweak to concepts.  </s>
<s> I remember Danbri being concerned about urirefs that don't denote.  </s>
<s> We may be back into an area similar to the "who defines what a uri means" teritory in that might be needing to say in the abstract syntax that undefined names from namespaces are syntactically invalid.  </s>
<s> Pat, I think we want to say there ain't no such thing rdf:_01.  </s>
<s> Is there a neat way to say that?  </s>
