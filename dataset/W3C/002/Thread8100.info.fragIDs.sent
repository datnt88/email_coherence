I'd be very surprised if anyone has shipped an implementation using the "*-bytes" property names yet (I know Apple hasn't because we're waiting for a consensus on the issues), so this is probably the best time to make a name change. 
I agree. 
At first I wondered about the discussion. 
For me a byte had 8 bits. 
But octets avoids all discussions how many bits it has. 
So now would be the 
time to change. 
Cheers, Edgar 
P.S. I didn't get any reaction on some earlier posts. 
But I guess silence 
means disagreement :-), so it's ok.

Current plan: I'll change it to octets. 
I had a hard time determining 
consensus on this one given the reaction at the in-person meeting.

I think the consensus at the WG meeting was that using the word "octet" was 
dumb, as we don't refer to "mega-octets" rather than megabytes, but that we 
should clarify that "byte" refers to 8 bits for the sticklers.

Well. 
This is an application of WebDAV, and WebDAV is an extension to HTTP. 
Can't we just stick to HTTP terminology?
