We are trying to use HTML tidy version 13th January, and are experiencing a removing them in the cleaing process. 
We have tried teaching tidy about these tags as empty and also as inline, but neither have been successful. 
Is there any way to teach tidy that these tags are not empty, but contain an 
attribute, even though there is nothing in between the tags? 
Attached please find a copy of our config file, in which we defined the Tidy requirements. 
Any insight you can provide would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks. Karen Schlesinger &amp; Scott Shandler 
What possible reason would you have for empty tags? 
What are you trying to style when there is nothing to style inside the tags? 
According to the DTD, TABLE requires TBODY, either explicitly or implicitly, which in turn requires at least one TR where each contains at least one TD or TH. 
It is just not legal to have TABLE /TABLE , ID attribute or no. (Adjust case appropriately for XML.) 
With DHTML (the DOM) you can add content. 
You can tell Tidy to leave empty P s alone with the "drop-empty-paras" option, but apparently not DIVs or SPANS. 
I've previously tricked Tidy before by 
IMO, there should be a "drop-empty-elements-with-IDs" option (though with hopefully a shorter name :). 
Or better yet, just a "drop-empty-elements" option, period. 
drop-empty-paras was too focused on one element.

I have run into a problem I need to get clear in my mind. 
Tidy allows (and creates) the following URL formats. 
The W3C validator passes the following URL formats. 
a href= 
"http://www.xxxxxxx.com/yyyyyy/zzzzzz.htm" a href="http://www.xxxxxxxl.com/yyyyyy/zzzzzz.htm" 
Are the above valid but bad HTML? 
Should a URL be all on one line unbroken like the following?

After the  and the element name, you can have any whitespace before and after 
the attribute name, before and after the = sign, or between the attribute value 
and the closing  of the start tag. 
Bad? 
How so? 
The following is perfectly valid: 
a href = "foo" 
If by bad, you mean hard-to-read, well yes -- in that example. 
But in the case 
of long URLs, it sometimes makes sense to linebreak before or after attributes, 
since you don't want to break the URL itself.

I that, I believe, is possible also for elements that lack id. 
Since an id is not really necessary for an empty span to have (or get) meaning this is not entirely logical.

Thank You I originally had the same thought but was being led astray.

Another reason is that you can use style sheets to style the empty element. 
One of the reasons I won't let Tidy loose on the RichInStyle.com test suite (http://richinstyle.com/test) is that it takes exception to things like div style="background: red; height: 100px; width: 100px; border: solid; float: left" , dropping them and making the test page useless. 
Yes. There should be a way of saying "leave empty elements alone, period". 
It probably ought to even be the default.

Thanks for your feedback. 
I am working on tweaking the rules tidy uses to prune empty elements. 
However, an empty table element is an error according to the HTML specs. 
I would be grateful if you could explain why you need an empty table element?

Can't the empty tags be inserted themselves in the same manner relative to the position of contentful markup (:before/:after)? 
AFAIK, the only tags that make sense when empty are TD, TH (which can be made to render as non-empty using CSS), and BODY. 
Even empty paragraphs make no sense in HTML (how can you reasonably describe nothingness as a paragraph?) except as a presentational abuse of HTML.
