<s> Title: URI Scheme for SNMP Author(s): D. Black, K. McCloghrie Filename: draft-black-snmp-uri-02.txt Pages: 11 SNMP and the Internet-Standard Management Framework are widely used for management of communication devices, creating needs to specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object instances) from non-SNMP management environments.  </s>
<s> For example, when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP access), there is a need for a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device for management.  </s>
<s> URLs fit this need well, as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols.  </s>
<s> This document defines a simple URI scheme so that SNMP can be designated as the protocol used for management.  </s>
<s> This scheme also allows URI specification of individual MIB object instances.  </s>

<s> To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command.  </s>
<s> To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader.  </s>
<s> Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages.  </s>

<s> Correct. RFC 2396 did allow it, but 2396bis does no longer.  </s>
<s> The proposed snmp URI scheme looks almost like a hierarchical uri, but as you noted it differs significantly.  </s>
<s> I'm in no way fluent on SNMP, but it would seem prudent to either go the "opaque way" and use another character than '/' for separating components, or go the "hierarchical" way and shift the engine/context parts into the path part of the uri.  </s>
<s> One simple way could be the usage of query parameter or always treat the first two path segments as engine/context identifier with a defined constant for default values.  </s>
<s> //Stefan  </s>
<s> It is noted in the "draft-black-snmp-uri-02.txt" that "The encoding rules specified in [RFC 2396] and [RFC 2732] apply to SNMP URIs, ....".  </s>
<s> Is this draft valid as long as it refers to the RFC2396?  </s>
<s> (It is assumed that the RFC2396bis will have different RFC number in the future, not overwrite the current RFC2396.) Should the draft reflect the RFC2396bis syntax instead of RFC2396 otherwise?  </s>
