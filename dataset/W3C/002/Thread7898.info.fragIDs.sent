What should I respond if a client asks for the properties Getcontentlength or GetContentType on a collection? 
The spec states: 
"The getcontentlength property MUST be defined on any DAV compliant resource that returns the Content-Length header in response to a GET." 
But it doesn't say, if the value a supposed to be the same as if I perform a 'Get' on that url. 
The collection itself doesn't normally have a content, so does this mean that if the collection have a default page. 
That it should return the values of that page? 
Or if the server is set to send a generated HTML page listing the children, should the values be text/html and the size of that page? 
Or have I missed something in the spec?

GET on a collection is not covered by DAV. 
You want to get the contents of a collection, then do a PROPFIND. 
You therefore don't have to maintain those proprties for collections (they 
also don't make sense).

WebDAV should still say what it means if a property "must be defined", but 
doesn't have a value... 
What does it mean to have a property that must be defined, but has no 
meaningful value? 
It means your spec has a design flaw. 
What is an example of such a thing? 
--Dylan 
For DAV:getcontentlength, RFC 2518 states, in section 13.4, that it contains "the Content-Length header returned by a GET without accept headers." 
I'm finding it difficult to see how you came to this interpretation. 
Yes, that was the intent for collections. 
If you can retrieve the contents of resource R via a GET on URLs collection/ and collection/index.html, then this implied to me that resource R had two URL mappings. 
In particular, it meant that a GET on collection/ was 
non-zero, and should result in a value for DAV:getcontentlength and DAV:getcontenttype. 
That was also the intent. 
Now, given the performance implications of this, I can easily see why a server might not want to compute a value here. 
Seems like it would be handy to have a value a server could use to indicate that the content length is variable, and dynamic, like d:dynamic/ and thus allow a server to avoid computing the contents of dynamic resources. 
Doesn't look like it.

Agreed, I'll add this to the issues list. 
Makes sense to me for a server to just give the property an empty value for these cases.

dynamic would be useful as a return value for any resource that has contents generated dynamically, like a servlet. 
This would be 
a REALLY great addition, IMHO.

At least in the case where the server in fact does not support GET on properties.
