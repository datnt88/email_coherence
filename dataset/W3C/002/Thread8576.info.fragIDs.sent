<s> Etc.  </s>
<s> [6]  </s>
<s> i agree that when software applies a signature automatically, there's no reason to worry about signing external references.  </s>
<s> but, when a human must choose deliberately to apply a signature, there's ample reason to sign external references.  </s>
<s> these two scenarios differ in two important ways: * a human's deliberate signature tends to be long-lived, while an automated signature tends to be short-lived; * with a human's deliberate signature, the human-interpretable representation tends to be legally binding, while with an automated signature, the underlying document format tends to be more important than the human-interpretable representation.  </s>
<s> so, for automated signatures, i agree with mr. eastlake that SHOULD is appropriate.  </s>
<s> for deliberate human-chosen signatures,  </s>

<s> * stability: for long life, a signed document's represen- tation must not depend on changeable external stylesheets, transforms, or parameters, unless those external components are signed, too.  </s>
<s> all three properties refer to a notion of "sameness."  </s>
<s> no doubt,  </s>
<s> the application designer must decide what's "the same," and what's  </s>
<s> not. in some contexts, pixel-by-pixel match-up may be necessary; in others, font changes may be acceptable, without violating this notion of "sameness;" in other contexts still, even automated translation from text to audio might be an acceptable change that shouldn't invalidate the signature.  </s>
<s> i've seen discussed three alternative ways to guarantee these signature-properties: * "...it is the transformed document that MUST be represented to the user and signed."  </s>
<s> (paraphrasing mr. reagle's 8/1 message [5]).  </s>
<s> * or, the signature can apply to all external references that affect the human-interpretable representation.  </s>
<s> * or, the signed document can carry a separate signature for each external reference that affects the human- interpretable representation.  </s>
<s> all three seem acceptable to me.  </s>
<s> thus, i suggest that when a human signs an XML document, the signature must be bound either to a human-interpretable representation of the document, or else to a fixed procedure for preparing such a representation.  </s>
<s> because the draft fails to require "MUST see what was signed," i suggest that the draft violates one of the XML Signature Requirements [7] that is central for XML signatures' security: "4.  </s>
<s> The signature design and specification text must not permit implementers to erroneously build weak implementations susceptible to common security weaknesses (such as downgrade or algorithm substitution attacks)."  </s>
<s> - sec 3.3, "Cryptography and Processing," [7] this is exactly my complaint about the current draft spec.  </s>
<s> compliant implementations can verify a signature as valid, even when unsigned transformas and external references have caused the document represen- tation's contents to change substantially.  </s>
<s> it's arguable whether my  </s>
<s> concern is more of a security problem than a crypto problem, but plainly, the bullet 4 text speaks both to crypto flaws and to security holes.  </s>
<s> from my reading of the current draft, compliant and useful applications can be written for either type of signature, human-chosen or automatic.  </s>
<s> but, the draft offers several pitfalls for an application programmer who wants to support legally-binding human-chosen xml-signatures.  </s>
<s> mr. reagle's external stylesheet example, cited above [4], is an example of such a pitfall.  </s>
<s> other examples are external references to pricing data, or to boilerplate contractual terms.  </s>
<s> as a cryptographer and security architect for a PKI security company, i'm very concerned that XML signatures should _gracefully_ support both automated signatures and humans' deliberate signatures.  </s>

<s> [2] my work with swick: http://world.std.com/~dtd [3] the draft i read: [4] reagle's mail: [5] reagle's text: [6] eastlake's reply: [7] requirements:  </s>
<s> Hi Don, I am certain that I am among the advocates who feel that an XML signature can only be legally binding if all components necessary to recreate what the user actually 'saw' are reproduced (for visually impaired persons, we assume either that a different XML document appropriate to their needs was created  </s>
<s> (e.g. one involving sound operatives) or that the appropriate application  </s>
<s> tool was applied to the markup (e.g. IVR rendition)).  </s>
<s> However, I do think that the spec adequately addresses our mutual concern without the need for an enormous amount of extra programming on your part.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, the two external information entities which qualifies what one sees that will be most used are images and stylesheets.  </s>
<s> An image can be that of a corporate logo, which can have a profound effect on whether one chooses to sign.  </s>
<s> And an XSL stylesheet is most often used to match XML data and describe how to present it by producing as output HTML with the important parts of the XML data embedded.  </s>
<s> In both cases, a signature on the XML is at least suspect and more likely useless without having the signature also cover the externally referenced information.  </s>
<s> The Signature element provides the capacity to set this up such that the XML libraries you procure should function as you want without any extra programming on your part.  </s>
<s> In fact, there are cases where it can be done in multiple ways.  </s>
<s> If you would like to sign your XML data plus some external image or other binary file, you simply add an extra Reference to your Signature element.  </s>
<s> If you would like to qualify your XML data with an XSL transformation, you can either sign the XML data plus add an extra reference to sign the XSL stylesheet, or you can add the stylesheet as a Transform, so that you can sign the output result.  </s>
<s> The principal difficulty is in writing software that could, for all XML markup, determine the external information entities required to completely specify the signing context.  </s>
<s> For example, how do you know that images are being referenced, esp.  </s>
<s> if they are only referenced by the result of an XSL transform?  </s>
<s> It is simply not possible to assess the external dependencies of any XML document.  </s>
<s> XML is a grammar with no lexicon.  </s>
<s> Those who intend to use XML must invent a lexicon and a set of semantics for that lexicon.  </s>
<s> Any keyword can be created by the lexicon's creator, and its associated meaning can be a reference to an external document.  </s>
<s> For example, XHTML still contains an IMG tag with a SRC attribute, even though XML has a facility-- often not used-- for referring to external unparsed entities.  </s>
<s> Moreover, a keyword could refer to multiple references with the semantic that the digest validation of any one of them is sufficient (some copies of a resource may be non-accessible or non-applicable in certain regions).  </s>
<s> Since all of these semantics have not yet been defined, there is no way that we can define an algorithm that resolves the semantics to determine the correct set of external references that MUST validate in order to produce the legally binding signature.  </s>
<s> Instead, what we are providing is the facility for specific applications (i.e. lexicon deployments) and more to the point specific documents to have Signature elements that are crafted to fit the particular needs of that document.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, we did not feel the problem was solvable by middle-ware XML signature implementations such as the one you want to build.  </s>
<s> Only the end-user application can examine the document in the context of its application-specific XML lexicon/semantics to determine the external entities that must be part of the signature, and then read the list of References to ensure that the material was included.  </s>
<s> Although this is one way to solve the problem, I actually believe that a completely different route will be taken.  </s>
<s> I think that the presentation layer, the rules for moving data from XML data structures into presentation, and the Signature element that captures these business rules will be vetted either by the validator or by independent parties.  </s>
<s> I think that the party that approves the document will do so by signing the bits that have been approved, a sort of seal of approval.  </s>
<s> Finally, I think that a signature on an actual legal agreement will cover the data added to specify the terms of the agreement as well the approval signature.  </s>
<s> This scheme would work particularly well if the approval phase were done by an independent organization.  </s>
<s> For example, suppose we are dealing with a financial document such as a mortgage application.  </s>
<s> The validator is the bank, the approver of the electronic mortgage application would be either the bank itself or by an independent organization-- a Bureau of Electronic Banking Documents.  </s>
<s> The validator can be the bank when the signer trusts the bank, and the bank simply wants to ensure that neither the signer nor a 3rd party interfered with the operation of the document in unapproved ways.  </s>
<s> The signer is also likely to retain an e-copy of the document, so if there is a dispute, the signer can have the document examined by an expert.  </s>
<s> Anyway, the point is that I doubt that even the end-user application will have to directly determine the external information dependencies and test whether they were signed.  </s>
<s> The validation of certain signatures is likely to be the extent of application code.  </s>
