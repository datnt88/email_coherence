<s> A good thing in general.  </s>
<s> Maybe "valid" but not "conforming", the recommendation restricts the value further to match the Name production in XML 1.0 and "1" doesn't do so.  </s>
<s> Upcoming Tidy versions will include better checks for name and id attributes.  </s>
<s> I understand that the name attribute is depreciated in xhtml  </s>
<s> "deprecated", it already was in HTML 4.01.  </s>
<s> _Required_, the name attribute only may be used for better compatibility.  </s>
<s> Newer XHTML versions don't include the name attribute at all.  </s>

<s> There isn't and I don't see any good reason to change that.  </s>

<s> Do a two step process, use tidy to convert to XHTML, then use XSLT to strip off the id attribute.  </s>

<s> NMTOKEN in loose xhtml, but the id is invalid.  </s>
<s> Or better, don't use IDs beginning with numbers.  </s>
<s> Will work just fine.  </s>
<s> As we move to XHTML, NAME will disappear and be supplanted by ID. IDs can't start with a number.  </s>
