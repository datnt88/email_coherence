<s> For certain applications, it is important to be able to specify the order of members of a collection.  </s>
<s> For example, a compound document made of pages wants a well defined order of the pages.  </s>
<s> The spec says nothing whatsoever about the order of members when one does an INDEX.  </s>
<s> It should say something, even if what it says is "no promises".  </s>
<s> I would like to have ordered collections, but I can appreciate that in the interests of simplicity you might not want to support this.  </s>
<s> If there is interest in extending the spec to support ordered collections, I would be happy to write up some ideas about how to do it.  </s>
<s> Basically, I'd suggest adding headers to PUT and ADDREF allowing you to specify the URI of a resource that the resource being added is to come either after or before.  </s>
<s> I would not propose any method for re-ordering collections at this time.  </s>
<s> I have what I hope is a set of simple questions.  </s>
<s> Given: a typical webpage with text and inline graphics.  </s>
<s> Is it "a compound document" by default or must it be declared as such??  </s>
<s> Before anyone answers, let me further ask  </s>
<s> a. suppose I want to edit/replace one of the graphics.  </s>
<s> Under the WEBDAV protocol, do I request/lock just the graphic?  </s>
<s> a1. If yes, does this also request/lock the document containing it?  </s>
<s> a2. If no, what happens when someone requests the enclosing doc?  </s>
<s> b. suppose the graphic in question is referenced by more than one document (like a background, or "line" glyph).  </s>
<s> b1.  </s>
<s> Does my having "checked it out" affect requests to any or all of the documents which reference it?  </s>

<s> I don't think DAV has any concept of "compound document".  </s>
<s> There is nothing to declare.  </s>
<s> You might store the page and its graphics in a collection, but that says nothing about the relationship amongst the pieces.  </s>
<s> And it has nothing to do with the topic of whether collections might have an optional order.  </s>
<s> As for your other questions, I am no expert but here's my answers.  </s>
<s> If I am wrong someone will correct me.  </s>
<s> Yes. No need to lock the others.  </s>
<s> No. If you lock a member, the other members remain unlocked.  </s>
<s> Requests, as in GET?  </s>
<s> The spec says that GET is entirely unaffected by LOCK.  </s>
<s> This should answer the remaining questions as well.  </s>
