At the last IETF in Was DC, it was suggested (by me I think) that we should change the d:getlastmodified property from using HTTP-Date to ISO-8601 dates. 
I would like to do this now before to many clients and servers exist, and we can never change it. 
Many people at the meeting agreed with me, but we did not know what problems this might cause existing clients and servers. 
So here is the question, can we make this change. 
Xythos currently uses HTTP-Date, but we will have no problem updating to ISO-8601 (and then patching our client's servers). 
Thanks, Kevin 
One line change for me. 
Not a problem.

I'm happy to make this change in sitecopy+cadaver.
