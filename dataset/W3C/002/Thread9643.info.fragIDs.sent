7: Face to face meeting See: Received regrets for the F2f from Frank Manola Stephen Petschulat Aaron Swartz Ron Daniel Had a straw poll on interest in participating in the F2f by phone and/or IRC and got interest from several people for phone access. 
ACTION: 2002-02-15#1 EricM: Find details of phone access during F2F ACTION: 2002-02-15#2 Brian: Consider holding teleconference(s) during F2F 8: Model Theory WD OLD ACTION 2002-02-08#2: Publication of RDF Model Theory WD Completed: RDF Model Theory W3C W3C Working Draft 14 February 2002 Congratulations were given to Pat and thanks to EricM for helping the with the publication process. 
9: Status of Test Cases WD OLD ACTION: 2001-11-30#3 JanG Get access to test case areas of W3C site CONTINUED OLD ACTION: 2002-01-11#2 JanG Post summary of Test Cases WD outstanding updates to list. 
CONTINUED OLD ACTION: 2002-01-11#1 bwm Persue CVS access for Jan with EM CONTINUED Question was raised if Pat Hayes was subscribed to www-rdf-comments and its purpose. 
He wasn't so would look into subscribing. 
ACTION: 2002-02-15#3 Brian: Announce new Model Theory WD to appropriate lists: rdf-logic, interest, ... 10: WG Status Brian noted that the status of the working group needed to be considered since it is chartered to finish early 2002. 
At present, the group has approximaltey 28 open issues, 7 postponed and 26 closed. 
This will be on the agenda for the F2F. 
11: Preparing for the f2f * rdfms-seq-representation: The ordinal property representation of containers does not support recursive processing of containers in languages such as Prolog. 
ACTION: 2002-02-15#4 PatH: Send a few paragraphs to the list to address this * rdfms-assertion: RDF is not just a data model; an RDF statement is an assertion. 
Brian said the director has an architectural requirement that we say something about this. 
PatH said that he was already down to do this ACTION: 2002-02-15#5 PatH, Graham: Will draft some appropriate words on the nature of assertions * Schema Issues Postponed, danbri not present * Contexts Pat Hayes noted that webont are discussion such things and if it was possible to say something on this, we should. 
This is mostly on how it could be fixed, could do, rather than must-do and would be more likely something for a future RDF Core WG with a new charter. 
ACTION: 2002-02-15#6 PatH: Draft something on contexts for the WG to consider in order to indicate to others our position 12: Issue rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr Clarify the interpretation of an ID attribute in the propertyElt production within a Description element with a distributive referrant. 
Propose: o the WG resolves that this issue be closed on the grounds that with the removal of rdf:aboutEachPrefix and rdf:aboutEach there are no distributive referrants and the issue is mute. 
See: APPROVED [scribe note: typo in proposal? 
"moot" not "mute"?] 13: Issue rdf-terminologicus The RDF community needs a precise terminology to enable it to discuss issues. 
(Martyn Horner) Propose: o the WG resolves that this issue is addressed by the primer and that this issue be closed. 
See: Discussion later brought up the note that the current editors draft of the primer has no glossary section so original working amended to the above. 
APPROVED 14: Issue rdfms-graph Formal description of the properties of an RDF graph. 
Propose: o the WG resolve that the model theory is a formal description of the properties of an RDF graph and that this issue be closed. 
See: APPROVED 15: Issue rdf-formal-semantics The RDF Model and Syntax Rec and RDF Schema CR do not provide a formal specification of the semantics of RDF. 
Propose: o the WG resolves that the model theory defines formal semantics for RDF and that this issue be closed. 
See: APPROVED 16: Issue rdfms-fragments Propose: o The WG resolves that the meaning of absolute URI's with fragment ID's is a matter of web architecture and beyond the scope of this WG and that this issue be closed. 
See: This item was skipped. 
17: Issue rdfms-literals-as-resources Consider replacing literals with resources whose URI uses the data: URI scheme. 
Propose: o the WG resolve that the proposed change would be a major change to the RDF specification and is out of scope for this WG. See: APPROVED 
18: Issue rdfms-literalsubjects Should the subjects of RDF statements be allowed to be literals? 
Propose: o the WG resolves that the current syntaxes (RDF/XML, n-triples, graph syntax) do not allow literals as subjects. 
o the WG notes that it is aware of no reason why literals should not be subjects and a future WG with a less restrictive charter may extend the syntaxes to allow literals as the subjects of statements. 
See: 
The above resolution was updated (one word change from agenda text). 
Clarification was asked by DanC whether for any entailments in the model theory, statements ended up with literal subjects. 
DanC's example was does { age rdfs:range rdfs:Literal. 
bob age "23". 
} entail { "23" rdf:type rdfs:Literal } JanG and PatH responded that no, it would not happen and that there are guards in the model theory to stop the above case. 
APPROVED 19: Issue rdf-containers-otherapproaches The design of the RDF Model collection classes exhibit various awkward features. 
Might these be augmented with a 'better' design? 
Propose: o the WG resolves this issue is out of scope for this WG but places the issue on the list of to be considered by a future WG. See: APPROVED 20: Issue rdfms-uri-substructure xmlns, uri+name pairs or just uris..? Clarification needed Propose: o the WG resolves to close this issue on the grounds that changing how resources are named on the web is a web architecture issue and beyond the scope of our charter. 
o Whereas: (a) the RDF 1.0 spec says that property and class names are computed from element and attribute names by concatenating their namespace names with their local names (b) it's useuful to be able to process RDF with XPath and XSLT, where even though concat(namespace-name(qname1), local-name(qname1)) is the same as concat(namespace-name(qname2), local-name(qname2)) the qnames themselves may not compare equal in XPath expressions. 
(c) lots of implementors have looked for advice on how to serialize RDF, and, in particular, how to compute a namespace name and localname from the name of a property or a class. 
the WG advises RDF schema/namespace/vocabulary designers (d) choose namespace names that end in non-xml-name-characters such as / # ? 
and we advise implementors of RDF serializers: (e) in order to break a URI into a namespace name and a local name, split it after the last XML non-name character. 
If the URI ends in a non-name-character throw a "this graph cannot be serialized in RDF 1.0" exception. 
See: The proposal in the agenda was amended in (e) in order to get the maximally-allowed XML name to be made from the characters at the end of the URI as Brian discussed in APPROVED ACTION: 2002-02-15#7 DaveB: Add sections addressing this resolution to the Syntax WD. ACTION: 2002-02-15#8 JanG: Add test cases based on those suggested by Dan in: 21: Issue rdfms-boolean-valued-properties No standard vocabulary is defined for representing boolean valued properties. 
The author of this suggestion proposes the introduction of two new properties, rdf:is and rdf:isNot. 
To represent the fact that someone likes chocolate, their resource could have the property rdf:is with a value of foo:ChocolateLover. 
Propose: The WG notes that since a boolean-valued property can be identified with a class, rdf:type can be used to represent boolean valued properties. 
Thus: foo chocolateLover true . 
foo rdf:chocolateHater true . 
can be represented by foo rdf:type ChocolateLover . 
foo rdf:type ChocolateHater . 
The WG notes that RDF(S) defines no built in mechanism for expressing that ChocolateLover and ChocolateHater are disjoint classes. 
The WEBONT WG are defining mechanisms for such expressions. 
The WG resolves to close this issue. 
See: The second of the alternative proposals in the agenda (above) was discussed. 
APPROVED 22: Model Theory for Containers Discussion of PatH's proposal for the semantics of rdf:Bag: and DanC's noted an idea on bags (isn't really a bag, but a bag nearby) that he would write up for the group: ACTION: 2002-02-15#9 DanC: Write up rdf:Bag idea and send to list 23: Reification Items from FrankM's Reification "subagenda" in 23.1 Entailment #1 Does? 
stmt1 rdf:type rdf:Statement . 
stmt1 rdf:subject subject . 
stmt1 rdf:predicate predicate . 
stmt1 rdf:object object . 
stmt2 rdf:type rdf:Statement . 
stmt2 rdf:subject subject . 
stmt2 rdf:predicate predicate . 
stmt2 rdf:object object . 
stmt1 property foo . 
entail: stmt2 property foo . 
Discussion of this entailment; FrankM proposed that the answer is NO. Some people are confused or don't care too much about it. 
APPROVED: Answer to above entailment is NO. 23.2 Interpretation of decision Discussion of what words to say about this, where and if reification syntax now has a meaning. 
No consensus on agreeing if the above entailment (and reification decision) was cast into English right. 
23.3 Entailment #2 Does? 
ex:subj ex:prop ex:obj . 
entail _:r rdf:type rdf:Statement . 
_:r rdf:subject ex:subj . 
_:r rdf:predicate ex:prop . 
_:r rdf:object ex:obj . 
APPROVED: The answer is NO ACTION: 2002-02-15#10 JanG: Add both entailments #1 and #2 to the test case suite JanG noted he has to work with Jos on manifests and support for entailment tests in the test cases areas. 
23.4 Not explicitly discussed. 
Sergey asked if we have a mechanism for reification or not, it seems we are deprecating it, so we should at least clarify a mechanism for serialising reified statements. 
DanC noted the syntax is still there and it is DaveB noted the mapping is described in the syntax WD. 24: Datatypes Review status and plan. 
Lots of discussion till meeting close and afterwards. 
DanC asked had S-B had gone away? 
wants to constrain the string values of a statement to the lexical range of the datatypes. 
Discussion continued as the meeting closed. 
END OF MEETING Some sketchy post meeting chat notes: DanC's question and ways to implement it - new machinery / properties or can do with existing ideas? 
DanC wants to talk of the lexical space of the datatype. 
DanC gave this example: foo dc:date "apple" dc:date rdfs:range xsdt:date.lex 
would be datatype-illegal Somebody suggested xsd:date rdfs:range xyz would allow URI xyz to be used as the lex space of the xsd:date datatype but might need some MT tweaks (not rdfs:range but rdfs:drange?) Sergey replied to this later in more detail: Supporting only W3C XML Schema datatypes as built-ins. 
What does it mean to implement RDF datatypes as currently specified Renaming rdf:value - having opposite properties [scribe: See attached IRC log for some notes, those after meeting end are more intermittent] Dave 14:28:03 logger_3 logger_3 has joined #rdfcore 14:28:03 carter.openprojects.net topic is: RDF Core WG Meeting 15:00-16:00 UTC Friday Agenda: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0388.html 14:28:03 carter.openprojects.net

15:37:42 dajobe-scribe danc: bag isn't really a bag, but a bag nearby, we can explain that 15:37:48 dajobe-scribe pathayes: sounds interesting 15:38:03 dajobe-scribe ACTION danc: write up this up today 15:38:11 dajobe-scribe s/this/his idea on the explanation/ 15:38:13 dajobe-scribe item 23 reification 15:38:23 dajobe-scribe subagenda 15:38:28 dajobe-scribe reif item 1 15:38:35 dajobe-scribe (frankm) 15:38:42 dajobe-scribe entailment 1 15:38:50 dajobe-scribe frankm: do we agree the item is no? 15:39:03 dajobe-scribe some agreements 15:39:13 dajobe-scribe jos: i have a problem with this; subject should be more defined 15:39:18 dajobe-scribe * dajobe-scribe not recordign this well 15:39:41 dajobe-scribe jos: could say this entailment is true 15:39:47 dajobe-scribe frankm: I'm confused by this 15:40:03 dajobe-scribe the source that pathayes is refering to is the source of the original stratement 15:40:06 dajobe-scribe (path) yes 15:40:18 dajobe-scribe .. so I could write stm1 source uri 15:40:27 dajobe-scribe ... why would I need that reification syntax anyway? 
15:40:38 dajobe-scribe ... I could just make all teh statemsnts I want about that thing 15:40:38 DanCon JosD, as far as I'm concerned, this rdf:subj/pred/obj stuff is worthless, but as graham said, it's "mostly harmless". 
15:40:43 dajobe-scribe path: talk about the subject 15:40:53 dajobe-scribe ... and provides an explict rdf map to the triple 15:40:59 dajobe-scribe ... oh, nevermind! 
15:41:06 AaronSw AaronSw has joined #rdfcore 15:41:17 dajobe-scribe josd: I don't care too much. 
It could work but it is meaningless 15:41:31 dajobe-scribe bwm: if there is no actual dissent, lets decide and move on? 
15:41:37 dajobe-scribe frankm: Agreed the answer is no? 15:41:43 dajobe-scribe APPROVED entailment 1 answer is NO 15:41:50 dajobe-scribe reification agenda item 2 15:41:59 DanCon hmm... I'd like to suggest that reification gets no screen-space in the primer. 
15:42:08 dajobe-scribe frankm: have we decided an isntance of rdf:Statement is a stating? 
15:42:15 dajobe-scribe danc: what is the impact? 
15:42:25 dajobe-scribe ... what docs will change? 
15:42:35 dajobe-scribe pathayes: some of the words in M&amp;S seem to say the opposite 15:42:40 dajobe-scribe danc: where will we write this down? 
15:42:50 dajobe-scribe ... in model theory / primer, that replace m&amp;s 15:42:58 dajobe-scribe frankm: are we contradicting something int he current docs? 
15:43:10 dajobe-scribe danc: my prefication is that we leave it in the syntax doc and that is all 15:43:20 dajobe-scribe pathayes: in primer maybe for reassurance? 
15:43:50 dajobe-scribe daveb: already in syntax doc, in simplest form 15:43:59 dajobe-scribe bwm: rdf community familiar with the Stating term 15:44:04 dajobe-scribe frankm: should be explained 15:44:12 dajobe-scribe patrick: an occurance of the statement 15:44:20 dajobe-scribe aaron: in the glossary 15:44:49 dajobe-scribe frankm: resolve to agree that they are statings? 
15:45:05 dajobe-scribe bwm: are we clear on what we agreeing? 
15:45:15 dajobe-scribe frankm: guidance for documetn writers 15:45:21 dajobe-scribe pathaes: something in MT doc 15:45:45 dajobe-scribe +sergey 15:45:48 dajobe-scribe discussion of what goes where 15:45:56 dajobe-scribe sergey: this vocab is undefined everywhere? 
15:46:13 dajobe-scribe frankm: not discusing reification cvocab? 
15:46:17 dajobe-scribe sergey: yes we are 15:46:27 dajobe-scribe danc: yes answer is they turn into non-magical properties 15:46:37 dajobe-scribe pathayes: not meaningless, no special meaning 15:46:43 dajobe-scribe sergey: don't get the difference 15:47:17 dajobe-scribe frankm: want to make a decision on "the meaning of rdf:Statement" and seperate issue of the 4-triple vocab 15:47:45 dajobe-scribe rond: uncomfortable approving statment versus stating, want something more concrete 15:47:52 DanCon the most I can do with "an rdf:Statement represents a stating" is abstain. 
I don't think it's an interesting thing to decide. 
15:48:12 dajobe-scribe frankm: talking about appearances of various things in rdf 15:48:34 dajobe-scribe jang: point2 is casting into English what is meant by the entailment in point 1 15:48:43 dajobe-scribe danc: hard to agree to that? 
15:49:14 dajobe-scribe bwm: move on for now to reification item 3? 15:49:41 dajobe-scribe frankm: believe item 2 follows from 1 15:49:44 dajobe-scribe (sounds of dissent in bg) 15:49:49 dajobe-scribe reification item 3 15:49:55 dajobe-scribe and an entailment 15:50:01 dajobe-scribe frankm: do we agree the answer is NO? 15:50:22 dajobe-scribe ... does a triple entail it's reification? 
15:51:04 DanCon action on the test case editor? 
15:51:05 dajobe-scribe APPROVED the answer is no to entailment 15:51:11 dajobe-scribe no 2 under item 3 15:51:25 dajobe-scribe bwm: no more reification issues left? 
15:51:35 dajobe-scribe ACTION jang: add to test suite? 
15:51:40 dajobe-scribe s/?// 15:52:09 dajobe-scribe jang: need to work with jos on this 15:52:15 dajobe-scribe sergey: do we have a mechanism for reification or not? 
15:52:22 dajobe-scribe ... seems we are deprecating it 15:52:36 dajobe-scribe ... so we should at least clarify a mechanism for serialising reified statements 15:52:41 dajobe-scribe xfering across the network 15:52:48 dajobe-scribe danc: syntax still there 15:53:01 dajobe-scribe pathayes: yes, but where is the connection between the original triple and the 4-triple reificaiton 15:53:07 dajobe-scribe danc: in teh syntax 15:53:36 dajobe-scribe daveb: yes, there is a section on this in the syntax 15:53:57 dajobe-scribe bwm: to sergey, move this to the list 15:54:10 dajobe-scribe .. use cases based on how do I do this? 
15:54:31 dajobe-scribe frankm: something w.r.t. frank's point of identifiying the original triple 15:54:33 DanCon take what? 
15:54:35 DanCon action on who? 
15:54:37 dajobe-scribe s/frank/path/ 15:54:39 DanCon whatever. 
15:54:56 dajobe-scribe item 24 main agenda - datatypes 15:55:19 dajobe-scribe still some bits incomplete in last thing (V3?) posted to list 15:55:22 dajobe-scribe (pathayes) 15:55:34 dajobe-scribe ... true local typing 15:56:06 dajobe-scribe ... magic triple asserts everything is local in item 3 15:56:07 dajobe-scribe (!) 15:56:18 dajobe-scribe ... gives the user more options 15:56:34 dajobe-scribe ... not more complexity, just draws users attention to more options 15:56:46 dajobe-scribe s/item 3/section 10 of v3 datatyping doc/ 15:56:54 dajobe-scribe danc: has S-B gone away? 
15:57:09 dajobe-scribe danc: ie. range of this property is constrained to literals that are the lexical representation of dates 15:57:12 dajobe-scribe pathayes: still there 15:57:26 dajobe-scribe for a datatype? 
15:57:27 dajobe-scribe bwm: no 15:58:02 dajobe-scribe danc: such as one for the xsd:date 15:58:35 dajobe-scribe pathayes: says yes 15:58:42 dajobe-scribe bwm: misunderstanding the Q? 15:58:57 dajobe-scribe bwm: foo dc:date "10" 15:59:05 dajobe-scribe bwm: date rdange xsd:date 15:59:08 dajobe-scribe and have xsd:date.lex 
15:59:19 dajobe-scribe danc: not what I mean 15:59:35 dajobe-scribe ... want to constrain the strings you have as property values 15:59:44 dajobe-scribe pathayes: how do you do that? 
15:59:53 dajobe-scribe danc: want to constrain to the lexical range of the datatypes 16:00:03 dajobe-scribe pathayes: no, can't do that - can't label lexical spaces of the datatypes 16:00:28 dajobe-scribe literals as subjects could do this 16:00:36 dajobe-scribe (danc, pathayes) 16:00:55 dajobe-scribe bwm: out of formal meeting time 16:01:08 DanCon ok; I already sent "where did S-B go?" mail. 
16:01:09 dajobe-scribe ... ahve a document, try to use that as the basis for our datatypiung solutoion 16:01:19 dajobe-scribe bwm: and moving fwd 16:01:26 dajobe-scribe ... can continue to discuss here 16:01:38 dajobe-scribe END OF MEETING 16:01:45 dajobe-scribe ---- 16:01:53 dajobe-scribe datatypes chat: 16:02:54 dajobe-scribe patrick: literals as subject and untidy literals 16:03:16 dajobe-scribe two different properties prop1 and prop2 with two different ranges 16:03:19 DanCon p1 range decimalInteger 16:03:22 dajobe-scribe one is decimalInteger and other is octalInteger 16:03:25 DanCon p2 range octalInt. 
16:03:28 DanCon x p1 "10". 
16:03:32 DanCon y p2 "10". 
16:04:10 dajobe-scribe - "10" is in lexical space of both datatypes (danc) 16:05:04 dajobe-scribe patrick: and an app that says give me triple and the property hanging of the literal node is going to g et the wrong value since the literal can be the wrong one - decmial or octal 16:05:25 dajobe-scribe danc: "10" is both an octal and a decimal numeral 16:05:55 dajobe-scribe patrick: but if you are doing a queyr and get back a literal node, and then ask for the peopreties of tat literal, you get both datatypes since literals are tidy 16:06:00 dajobe-scribe (am I recording this righ?) 16:06:17 dajobe-scribe pathayes: you want literals to denote their values? 
16:06:32 dajobe-scribe ..l. wwould the datatyping barf if given this? 
16:06:37 DanCon * DanCon isn't too worried about the record 16:06:47 dajobe-scribe * dajobe-scribe will slow down then 16:06:53 dajobe-scribe discussion 16:08:57 dajobe-scribe pathayes: if literals could be subjects... 16:08:57 JosD JosD has quit 16:09:40 dajobe-scribe danc: handy to give our users names for lexical spaces, mapping , ... 16:09:52 dajobe-scribe bwm: feedback from users, too complex to explain? 
16:10:17 dajobe-scribe patrick: someone going to ask xsd to do it? 
16:10:19 dajobe-scribe danc: we can do it 16:10:53 DanCon I'd be quite happy to make up a name for "the lexical space of a (property used as a) datatype" 16:11:07 dajobe-scribe discsuion of sergey's proposal for union 16:11:25 dajobe-scribe sergey: also like danc's proposal 16:11:45 DanCon dc:date rdfs:range [ is lexicaSpace of xsdt:date ]. 16:11:46 dajobe-scribe ... have the values and the lexical spaces 16:12:05 dajobe-scribe patrick: get rid of the value idiom? 
16:12:57 dajobe-scribe wasn't that 4 months ago? 
16:13:02 dajobe-scribe discussion 16:14:23 dajobe-scribe danc: let me build an expression for the property I want, need a lexicaSpaceof property 16:14:46 dajobe-scribe ... tricky since there are many "the ranges" for a datatype 16:15:42 dajobe-scribe danc: want to conclude foo dc:date "apple" is false 16:15:55 dajobe-scribe phahes: but no negation 16:16:03 dajobe-scribe danc: but datatypes give us this 16:17:21 dajobe-scribe discussion of rdf reasoners and datatypes 16:18:28 dajobe-scribe and application space 16:18:47 dajobe-scribe patrick: using the knowledge in rdf and doing more 16:20:31 dajobe-scribe * dajobe-scribe wonders what it means to implement RDF datatypes, as currently speciifed 16:21:37 DanCon to me, to implement datatypes is to parse a document and say "nope; that document is broken. 
it says 'apple' is in the range of the XML Schema date datatype" 16:22:32 dajobe-scribe so a document that generated foo dc:date "apple" (with datatype checks) would be illegal? 
16:23:21 DanCon if that document also said dc:date rdfs:range xsdt:date.lex, then yes, it would be datatype-illegal 16:23:28 dajobe-scribe that's what I meant 16:23:51 dajobe-scribe datatype-illegal: hmm 16:29:59 dajobe-scribe discussion of just having xsd datatypes only 16:32:01 dajobe-scribe phayes: said, I think: the name for the lex space of the dc:date rdf:type of the range of the datatype 16:32:09 dajobe-scribe s/of the/is the/ 16:32:23 dajobe-scribe ugh, try 2 16:32:34 dajobe-scribe phayes: said, I think: the name for the lex space of the dc:date rdf:type is the rdfs:range of the datatype 16:36:21 dajobe-scribe examples based on xsd:date 16:36:27 dajobe-scribe danc: says as a property; patrick as a class 16:37:03 dajobe-scribe used with a pair (subject, object), danc interested in the range - the lexical space 16:37:57 dajobe-scribe so can make a property [xsd:date xsd:range xyz] 16:38:06 dajobe-scribe and xyz can be used as the lex space of the datatype 16:38:07 dajobe-scribe (all danc) 16:38:23 dajobe-scribe jang: but no guarantee that it is just what you want 16:38:32 dajobe-scribe danc: want that guarantee 16:38:35 dajobe-scribe phayes: could od this 16:38:59 dajobe-scribe sergey: not sure range does this 16:39:20 dajobe-scribe phayes: could but an extra condition, when it is a datatype 16:39:26 dajobe-scribe sergey: ugly? 
16:40:10 dajobe-scribe ... but sometimes want to use the whole range [not sure about recording this right] 16:41:55 DanCon * DanCon takes another call briefly. 
16:42:03 DanCon * DanCon returns 16:43:31 DanCon does DatatypeSummary3 say what the class extension of xsdt:date is? 
16:44:51 dajobe-scribe pathayes doc: http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/DatatypeSummary3.html 16:47:24 PatH PatH has quit 16:47:44 DanCon * DanCon must run soon 16:47:56 dajobe-scribe several people want to rename rdf:value as used here for datatypes 16:49:19 dajobe-scribe telecon slot runs out in 10 mins I think 16:50:16 dajobe-scribe rdf:value and lform - opposite properties? 
16:50:48 dajobe-scribe pathayes suggested ^ 16:51:00 dajobe-scribe bwm: some m&amp;s examples wouldn't fit that? 
16:51:18 dajobe-scribe discussion of what to call new property(s) 16:51:30 dajobe-scribe in order to stay away from rdf:value 16:52:55 DanCon ciao, all. 
16:58:07 dajobe-scribe have we invented anonymous predicates? 
16:58:22 dajobe-scribe dajobe-scribe has quit 16:59:34 em em has quit 16:59:49 AaronSw * AaronSw suspects that telecon is over... 16:59:51 AaronSw AaronSw has left #rdfcore

Could my posting please be added as a "Further Discussion" reference for this issue, if that can be done even after it is agreed to be closed? 
I did not bring this up during the telecon as I did not feel it should delay approval of the action or that rewording of the resolution was manditory. 
Nor did I wish to consume further valuable time on it. 
Still, I would like for there to be some kind of mention somewhere about the tidy/untidy, meaningful/nonmeaningful subjects issue, and I think my use case referenced above is a reasonably specific and precise summary of the issue. 
Thanks, Patrick
