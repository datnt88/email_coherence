<s> Behalf Of Sijo Mathew Hi all, Could somebody on the list help me to find out the exc-c14n output of the following xml document.(Assume  </s>
<s> that the, InclusiveNamespacesPrefixList is null).  </s>
<s> foo:mynode xmlns="http://default.org"  </s>
<s> xmlns:foo="http://foo.org"  </s>
<s> regards, Sijo Sijo Mathew Atinav Inc. www.atinav.com  </s>
<s> Tony, Thanks for the reply.  </s>
<s> But, I couldn't correctly identify the rule that was applied to render the following output element.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that, out of the 4 rules given in the section 3 of the exc-c14n specification, 1) rule-1 and rule-2 have nothing to do with this case.  </s>
<s> 2) rule-3 applies only to namespace nodes *with prefixes*.  </s>
<s> In our case the namespace node rendered has no prefix.  </s>
<s> 3) rule-4 says when to render xmlns="".  </s>
<s> But, we have no such node in the output.  </s>
<s> After all, the inherited rules from C14N cannot not be applied, as we  </s>
<s> have a null InclusiveNamespacesPrefixList.  </s>
<s> Could you specify, what is wrong with my undestanding of the exc-c14n spec...? regards, Sijo  </s>
<s> Sure they can.  </s>
<s> Re-read the spec.  </s>
<s> It's rule 3, with an earlier sentence in mind, "A similar definition applies  </s>
<s> for an element E in a document subset that visibly utilizes the default namespace declaration, which occurs if E has no namespace prefix."  </s>
<s> I can see where you got confused; however, as hard as I try I can't easily reformulate rule 3 to include this caveat every time the term "prefix" is used without making it completely unreadable.  </s>
<s> Consequently, I propose this imperfect eratum with the expectation that should a second revision ever issue, we'll need to maybe introduce a new defined term or re-structure these rules to better express our intent:  </s>
<s> E04 2003-07-02 (Editorial) In section 3. Specification of Exclusive XML Canonicalization, rule 3 needs to be read to include non-empty default namespace declarations, consequently it should read as, 3. A namespace node N with a prefix that does not appear in the the InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList [INS: (including non-empty default namespaces with a "null" prefix) :INS] is rendered if all of the conditions are met:  </s>
<s> Thanks Joseph, for adding the erratum.  </s>
<s> But as you said, it would be nice to restructure the rules to include the same, especially because this is an issue with the core part of the specification.  </s>
<s> Suggestion : I think, merging the same with rule-3 may not be easy, but of course you can add a separate rule.  </s>
<s> Thanks once again, regards, Sijo  </s>
<s> applies  </s>
