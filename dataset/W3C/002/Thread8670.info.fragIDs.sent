'Section 6.4.2 PKCS1' has long stated that an example will be provided? 
Does anyone care to provide one, or should we delete that editorial note? 
(Also, we do want to call this section 'PKCS1' right?) 
The output of the RSA algorithm is an octet string. 
The SignatureValue content for an RSA signature shall be the base64 encoding of this octet string.

I can transcribe a certificate's signature (from a test system) in this form if desired. 
However, this would not be as easy to understand as the example in DSS. 
It would be something like: the following value (128 bytes binary, 172 characters of base 64) is a signature value for this algorithm associated with the following public key (140 bytes binary). 
This brings up a second question. 
Which parts of the ASN.1 wrapping are to be included? 
A 1024-bit signature may be encoded in either 128 or 129 bytes, depending on whether the high-order bit is 0 or 1, and there is also the "extra-bits" byte, which is almost always zero. 
Here are the examples of what I mean, for a typical 512-bit signature: 03 42 00 00 85 zy (62 more bytes) 03 41 00 62 yz (62 more bytes) Where do we start the conversion to base 64 - with the 03 byte, the first 00 byte, or the first byte after the 00's? 
Key Values were somewhat clearer, but not absolutely so. 
Here is a fairly typical example for a 1024-bit RSA key: 30 81 89 02 81 81 00 C4 xy (126 more bytes) 02 03 01 00 01 Does the value to be converted for the exponent start with "C4" or with "00"?

Here are sample values for a PKCS-1 signature as promised earlier: The following signature value represents a digest value for the public key given in this example: RSAKeyValue modulus="AQAB" exponent= "AMQO0hFPntMkB+a5vZGwgzfaN2jyKOx2z+7V+ljqHC2QLTX8sUmQ1NepLC+lo7m2nzqjRKXMEd0XRbE+2wqp1zwXuRC4ebuFRMtfTM8ZF0YKzL2r88gaVUYAVMFJVeX6CuYYZm5LUIcjXcv+i6UEYQ1A7E7yvoPVHI+O3rPQECd1" The value of this public key exponent includes an ASN.1-DER sign-suppression byte as part of the data converted to base 64. 
The data converted for public key exponent will always start with between 1 and 8 zero bits, inclusive.
