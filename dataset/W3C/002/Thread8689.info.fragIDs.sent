<s> Actually, the limitations of the XPath model should not necessarily be a limitation of c14n, especially in such a simple case.  </s>
<s> For starters, the current goal is to have a consistent way of writing XML 1.0, so for this version we could simply render the root node as ?xml  </s>
<s> version="1.0"?  </s>
<s> #xA rather than producing nothing as the result of the root  </s>
<s> node.  </s>
<s> This seems like a good idea since we really don't know what's coming in future versions of XML, so deciding how to canonicalize it now may not be appropriate.  </s>
<s> For example, it could happen that neither infoset nor xpath have a data model that adequately captures the next version of XML.  </s>
<s> However, even if you want to preserve the XML version, the fact that c14n applies an xml processor to the input to produce a node-set does not change the fact that c14n *has* the input and can therefore recover the version, although an application function hook may be required to help with character encoding issues for non-UTF.  </s>
<s> Also, the absense of a version should be construed as 1.0.  </s>
<s> This seeming need for a character encoding function hook actually leads one to a solution that might be more appropriate for something like DSig.  </s>
<s> We need c14n to do things like canonicalize SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> If the SignedInfo is coming from an XML document with version  1.0, we would like to know that, but the canonicalizer will only receive the SignedInfo text.  </s>
<s> Somehow, the version info either needs to be prepended to the SignedInfo, or the surrounding document's version must simply be known by "implementation-specific" means and provided to the canonicalizer as an additional parameter (we already provide the input and an optional XPath expression as parameters, so one more won't hurt).  </s>
<s> So, if c14n received a version string of "anything", it could render the following text for the root node of the node-set (if it is in the output node-set):  </s>
<s> Finally, as you can see, there are lots of options for solving this problem,  </s>
<s> and using XPath as a basis is not really causing a problem.  </s>
<s> In fact the only problem I do have is that the c14n issues list has not been provided to  </s>
<s> me, so the current version has not accounted for things like this because I didn't know about them.  </s>
<s> With respect to the issue above, what do people think is the best choice:  </s>
<s> A) ignore version  </s>
<s> B) use a version of 1.0  </s>
<s> C) recover version from input document (kind of hard) D) parameterize version, with default of 1.0 Obviously I like the last one best, and thanks David for bringing this up again.  </s>

<s> John, you're right in that some of these things were discussed before but not all the context has a been public since it were part of the deliberations of the Syntax WG. (Consequently, my impulse is just to go with any assumption/decisions made in the original draft unless we have a good reason to over turn it.)  </s>
<s> However, in rooting through the archives, this specific issue was discussed exactly a year ago and actually brought to XML Signature list.  </s>
<s> [1] You can find an official poll of this WG at [2] (and a resulting thread).  </s>
<s> Since we can't predict the future, if there's a new XML, people could always right a new C14n.  </s>

<s> Note: if we leave the XML Decl out, and specify that this C14n spec applies *only* to XML 1.0 documents, we can postpone the decision about whether XML1 and XML2 docs can ever be canonically equivalent to the time we write the XML2 c14n spec.  </s>
