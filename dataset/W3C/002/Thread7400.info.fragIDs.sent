A new revision of the WebDAv Distributed Authoring Protocol has been submitted to the Internet Drafts editor, and will be available in the Internet Drafts directory in the next few days as 
draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-09. 
This revision addresses Keith Moore's comments on the previous (-08) revision, and resolves problems submitted to the list. 
While a detailed list of changes to the specification is currently under preparation, major changes include: * changed to be in agreement with newer XML namespace proposals, 
specifically WD-xml-names-19980916 * changed status code 425 (Insufficient Space on Resource) to 507 (Insufficient Storage) * added language to clarify meaning and requirements for namespace consistency * added charset attribute to Content-Type headers for text/xml bodies in examples * added charset encoding attribute to XML examples The authoritative revision of the specification is always the text version, which is available at: 9.txt A more readable variant of the protocol is available in PDF at: 9.pdf (Note that the PDF variant still needs to be checked for widows and orphans, have the headers and footers formatted right, and make sure examples fit on one page, etc. 
As a result, expect a new PDF version in the next few days.) A variant of the protocol which has all changes marked is available as a Word 97/98 document at: 9-tracked.doc 
(Note: the page numbers are incorrect in this variant, due to complications with change tracking.) 
If you find any problems with these documents, please report them to the list quickly! 
After a brief last call for comments 
draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-09 will go before the IESG for approval as a Proposed Standard.

Access forbidden. 
Not a problem with the document exactly but it does make more detailed comments hard.

Dana, Sorry about that -- today you get the "bad timing of the day award." 
Earlier today I received some complaints that the change-tracking-enabled variant of the -09 spec. 
wasn't displaying correctly because it was returning the wrong MIME type (text/plain instead of application/msword). 
You tried to access the text variant just as I was discovering that, on our web server, if your .htaccess file (the Apache config file where you map MIME types to file extensions) isn't group and world readable, it shuts down access to the entire directory. 
This lasted for about 2-3 minutes, which is why you get the bad luck award... :-) It should be working now.
