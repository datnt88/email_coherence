<s> This issue was originally raised by Sanford Barr: The description of the issue is: Is there a need for a PUTL (put which succeeds only if the resource is locked) method to avoid certain classes of overwrite conflicts, or a need to restrict the behavior of PUT on WebDAV servers to only accept writes if the resource is locked?  </s>
<s> Additional background rationale is provided in Section 6.7 ("Usage Considerations") of RFC 2518: Two clients A and B are interested in editing the resource ' index.html'.  </s>
<s> Client A is an HTTP client rather than a WebDAV client, and so does not know how to perform locking.  </s>
<s> Client A doesn't lock the document, but does a GET and begins editing.  </s>
<s> Client B does LOCK, performs a GET and begins editing.  </s>
<s> Client B finishes editing, performs a PUT, then an UNLOCK.  </s>
<s> Client A performs a PUT, overwriting and losing all of B's changes.  </s>
<s> There are several reasons why the WebDAV protocol itself cannot prevent this situation.  </s>
<s> First, it cannot force all clients to use locking because it must be compatible with HTTP clients that do not comprehend locking.  </s>
<s> Second, it cannot require servers to support locking because of the variety of repository implementations, some of which rely on reservations and merging rather than on locking.  </s>
<s> Finally, being stateless, it cannot enforce a sequence of operations like LOCK / GET / PUT / UNLOCK.  </s>
<s> WebDAV servers that support locking can reduce the likelihood that clients will accidentally overwrite each other's changes by requiring clients to lock resources before modifying them.  </s>
<s> Such servers would effectively prevent HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 clients from modifying resources.  </s>
<s> WebDAV clients can be good citizens by using a lock / retrieve / write /unlock sequence of operations (at least by default) whenever they interact with a WebDAV server that supports locking.  </s>
<s> HTTP 1.1 clients can be good citizens, avoiding overwriting other clients' changes, by using entity tags in If-Match headers with any requests that would modify resources.  </s>

<s> Once again, just to get discussion going... I'll note that there hasn't seemed to be a lot of people asking for this so I'd suggest in the interest of keeping the spec simple that we defer this proposal until there appears to be more demand.  </s>
<s> The proposal actually provided for an option that didn't require a change to the functional spec so that remains an option for those that might later discover that this is important.  </s>
<s> I guess I'd consider a proposal to recomend that people lock resources before they do PUT on them.  </s>
<s> I'd actually prefer to not even do that though.  </s>
<s> I think we've made the issues clear enough in the spec.  </s>
<s> People can chose to put a lock on the resource if they want.  </s>
<s> Other opinions?  </s>
<s> J.  </s>
<s> We certainly should not restrict the behavior of PUT to only accept writes if the resource is locked (for the reason given in 2518, namely interoperability with non-locking clients).  </s>
<s> The If header allows you to specify that a PUT should only succeed if the resource is locked, so I see no reason to add a PUTL method.  </s>
<s> So I agree with Jason's conclusions (i.e. reject this proposal).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>

<s> - Jim Is there, or should there be, anything in WebDAV that prevents a server from refusing to process any PUT requests for an unlocked resource?  </s>
<s> Seems to me that this issue fits cleanly into the set of decisions that are left to the server implementer and that can be decided without impacting WebDAV compliance.  </s>
