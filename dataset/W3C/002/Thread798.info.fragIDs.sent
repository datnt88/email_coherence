<s> I have absolutely no clue how to run Tidy.  </s>

<s> How do I use Tidy??? Do You Yahoo!? Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo! Mail  </s>
<s> Well, Win2000 is pretty good (at least by Microsoft's dubious standards) and certainly way ahead of WinMe (a real pile of shinola).  </s>
<s> More to the point, I routinely and successfully use Tidy under Win2000.  </s>
<s> When you say that the program just sits there, doing nothing, do you mean that you can't even run it, or that it appears to run but does nothing of use?  </s>
<s> If the former, you have a Tidy-unrelated problem and you'll have to figure out for yourself how to get a command line prompt, etc.  </s>
<s> If the latter, just what does it do?  </s>
