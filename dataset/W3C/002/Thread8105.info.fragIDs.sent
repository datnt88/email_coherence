<s> Stumbled across this recent press release: "To meet the needs of enterprise developers, XMLSPY 5 builds on the success of previous award winning versions through the addition of several key new features: Enhanced WebDAV Support -- Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is a standardized set of extensions to the HTTP (web) protocol, which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage XML files located on remote web-servers.  </s>
<s> XMLSPY 5 and AUTHENTIC 5 now support Delta-V (http://www.webdav.org/deltav/), an extension to the WebDAV protocol which enables check-in/check-out functionality when used in conjunction with a WebDAV server, thus supporting XML content editing in a truly collaborative, distributed environment, such as the Web."  </s>
<s> Interesting.  </s>
<s> A trace reveals that it does indeed PROPFIND some DeltaV properties, but it's unclear what it does with them.  </s>
<s> After switching off autoversioning on our server, I wasn't able to PUT resources anymore.  </s>
<s> No Checkin/Checkout menu item in sight.  </s>
<s> Did anybody else have more success?  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> OK, I finally got feedback from Altova.  </s>
<s> The Home Edition doesn't seem to do DeltaV, but the Enterprise Edition does.  </s>
<s> Once an external web folder is added to a project, version-controlled resources can be checked-in and checked-out.  </s>
<s> Checkin even prompts for DAV:comment (I think this is the first client doing this :-).  </s>
<s> I haven't managed to enable version-control using XML-Spy, though.  </s>
<s> Some more info is at: Julian  </s>
