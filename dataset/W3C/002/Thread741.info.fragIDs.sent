<s> How do I get Tidy to leave my entities alone ?  </s>
<s> e.g., if I have an entity in my HTML doc.  </s>
<s> instance that is not recognized by Tidy (not in entities.c),  </s>
<s> Tidy changes the ampersand to &amp;amp;, which I do not want it to do.  </s>
<s> I want the entity to pass through Tidy unscathed -- i.e. it ought to leave: &amp;num; &amp;ast; alone, but instead, it erroneously changes them to: &amp;amp;num; &amp;amp;ast;  </s>
<s> Also, what if I want it to change a literal " in CDATA into  ??  </s>

<s> try quote-ampersand: no  </s>
<s> OK, this helps to leave &amp;foo; and &amp;num; and &amp;ast; alone, but I DO also want NAKED "&amp;" to be changed to &amp;amp; (which this does not do) -- is that possible, or is it too much to expect both?  </s>
<s> Also, both using AND not using --quote-ampersand no, Tidy changes by to a literal " mark, which is extremely annoying.  </s>
<s> I'd think that at least one of them would leave it untouched.  </s>
<s> Help !  </s>

<s> Which version of Tidy are you using ?  </s>
