Do we have a clear consensus on what name we are going to give to the property that links a value to its literal? 
We've been using rdf:value, but people want to protect that for legacy purposes. 
Bear in mind that it has the bnode denoting the value at the blunt end, and the literal itself at the sharp end, so if it says 'value' then it ought to be 'valueOf' Possibilities include 
rdf:dlit rdf:dlex (to suggest the LEXical space of a Datatype) 
rdf:valueOf 
rdf:nameIs

I suggest use of rdfs namespace, rather than rdf. 
My personal preference is for rdfs:lex (rdfs:dlex if this is more consistent with other names), but I don't care strongly.

sounds good, rdfs:dlex 
Jos ps there's too much in it, but just to give an idea of an entailment 
test case (containing other etc's and still using rdf:dlit) -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Feb/0022.html 
I have several times suggested rdf:lform, which is derived from the official XML Schema terminology for 'lexical form' which is what in fact the object of such a property is. 
Per Brian's suggestion of adding new vocabulary into the RDFS rather than RDF space, it should then be rdfs:lform. 
Not very mnemonic, but I could live with either. 
Though I think rdfs:lform is better. 
Though I understand what it means, after a bit of work, this "feels odd" to me for some reason. 
I think because it is "reversed" compared to most property name readings which say what the property value is rather than how it relates to the subject. 
I could live with it if I had to, but I still think it's a little odd. 
Don't like this. 
It's not a name. 
It's a lexical form. 
Too much semantic baggage with 'name'. 
Nope. 
Patrick 
I can live with it.

Right. 
It also sounds rather like 'dyslexia' if you say it fast, which I also kind of enjoy.
