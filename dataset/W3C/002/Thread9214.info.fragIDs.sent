<s> Revising in light of an error pointed out privately by Stefan Kokkelink - thanks!  </s>
<s> Here goes  </s>
<s> The confusion is the different interpretation of rdf:ID in propertyElt when the element is empty / non-empty.  </s>
<s> 1. if the propertyElt is an *empty* XML-element, an rdf:ID is the identifier of the target resource: Jan Grant has been working on empty elements but not considered rdf:ID so far: The current relevant words are [[3.  </s>
<s> r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or a new resource.  </s>
<s> If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new resource.]]  </s>
<s> section 6 paragraph beginning [[Properties and values expressed in XML attribute form within an empty XML element E..., second sentence of item #3] so the answer to the test case Brian McBride gave in rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:random="http://random.ioctl.org/#" is that the statement: (http://random.ioctl.org/#bar,  </s>
<s> http://random.ioctl.org/#someProperty,  </s>
<s> document-URI#foo) should be generated; no reification occurs since rdf:ID identifies a resource, not a statement here.  </s>
<s> 2. if the propertyElt is an *non-empty* XML-element, an rdf:ID is the identifier of the reified statement: [[The value of the ID attribute, if specified, is the identifier for the resource that represents the reification of the statement.]]  </s>
<s> section 6 paragraph beginning [[Within propertyElt (production [6.12]),]] So stating the issue again: [[The propertyElt production 6.12 of the grammar does not allow both an ID attribute and a resource attribute to be specified.]]  </s>
<s> and goes on to give an example with an empty element.  </s>
<s> In case #1 (empty element) since rdf:ID points to the target resource, adding rdf:resource as well would have two statement objects which does not make sense.  </s>
<s> Aside: I don't know why rdf:resource alone wasn't used uniquely to point to a target resource rather than both rdf:ID and rdf:resource being allowed.  </s>
<s> I suspect you often want to point to local IDs and making rdf:ID be the identifier of a reified statement wouldn't make sence because there are potentially many statements generated from propName, propAttr - so which one would it be?  </s>
<s> 6.12 part 4 which applies in this case is currently:  </s>
<s> ' ' propName idRefAttr?  </s>
<s> bagIdAttr?  </s>
<s> propAttr* '/ '  </s>
<s> and remains valid (ID and resource are alternatives).  </s>
<s> In case #2 (non empty element), the current 6.12 part 1 is ' ' propName idAttr?  </s>
<s> ' ' value ' /' propName ' ' where no rdf:resource attribute is allowed and rdf:ID identifies the reified statment.  </s>
<s> It does not make sense to add rdf:resource here, since in that case if the value of the property was a resource, case#1 could be used to perform that.  </s>
<s> In summary - no change need be made to the grammar although some clarifications are obviously needed since this wasn't too clear.  </s>

<s> It was my understanding that the issue was the fact that statements using resources as objects could not be reified.  </s>
<s> For example: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:e="http://rdf.example.org/#"  </s>
<s> would be expected to create the triples: #bar e:someProperty #baz .  </s>
<s> #foo rdf:type rdf:Statement ; rdf:subject #bar ; rdf:property e:someProperty ; rdf:object #baz .  </s>
<s> But the grammar does not allow this because of the (somewhat unexpected and little-known) usage of ID to name a new property.  </s>
<s> Along with Jan Grant's proposal for removing the creation of new resources on empty propElts, I think that the use of ID to name them should also be removed.  </s>
<s> Thus your option 2 would always be the case.  </s>

<s> I'm not following you here Dave. is clearly legal and the rdf:ID attribute defines the URI of the refied statement the property represents.  </s>
<s> The question that arises is whether is legal, with again the rdf:ID attribute defining the URI of the reifed statement.  </s>
<s> It does seem a bit irregular to allow the use of an rdf:ID attribute to identify the reifed statement in the case where the object  </s>
<s> is a literal, but not in the case where it is a resource.  </s>
<s> And strictly speaking, the grammar does not rule it out as the rdf:resource attribute  </s>
<s> matches the idAboutAttr?  </s>
<s> in the production and the rdf:ID attribute matches the propAttr*.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> My take on Dave's comments in: is that you two agree in this case (non-empty propertyElt) but I should let Dave speak for himself :-).  </s>
<s> I think it does rule this out - see below.  </s>
<s> But when a propertElt is empty, idAboutAttr is not part of the grammar: [6.12] propertyElt ::= ' ' propName idAttr?  </s>
<s> ' ' value ' /' propName ' '  </s>
<s> ' ' propName idAttr?  </s>
<s> parseLiteral ' '  </s>
<s> literal ' /' propName ' '  </s>
<s> ' ' propName idAttr?  </s>
<s> parseResource ' '  </s>
<s> propertyElt* ' /' propName ' '  </s>
<s> It seems like the intent of the idRefAttr (in the last option of [6.12]) is to make it illegal for an empty propertyElt to contain both an id and resource attribute.  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> I think thats exactly right Art.  </s>
<s> The question is whether the spec *should* allow: not whether it does allow it.  </s>
<s> What I've seen so far is an answer that says the spec doesn't allow it.  </s>
<s> I feel that doesn't fully answer the issue raised.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I know that Dave seems to feel differently about this, but I see a simple solution to this and empty property elements: - Define an empty property element to be an empty literal - Define an id and a resource to be the reification of the statement  </s>
<s> So simply: becomes: #foo :bar "" .  </s>
<s> and becomes: #foo :bar #bat .  </s>
<s> #baz rdf:subject #foo ; rdf:predicate :bar ; rdf:object #bat .  </s>

<s> We *can* do these things - i.e. changing the RDF/XML syntax but we need good reasons.  </s>
<s> Neatness is one but I feel it isn't strong enough to counterpoint breaking existing parsers; make no mistake - this would be a change in the meaning.  </s>
<s> I feel we should be making changes additions, removals, modifications that break existing code only if absolutely necessary for important reasons such as removing ambiguity.  </s>
<s> In this case we can write a better explanation of what is already allowed in the syntax and there is already a way to do what is required - make the property statement and give an ID for the reified statement, so there is no requirement for any new syntax.  </s>
<s> If this was RDF/XML syntax version 2 (no backwards compatibility required) then we wouldn't be starting from here.  </s>

<s> Sorry for not being clear, but I see a very good reason for this.  </s>
<s> It seems that consensus suggests that:  </s>

<s> should result in an empty literal for the value of propName.  </s>
<s> In such a case, something like: could only be understood as assigning foo to the reification of the  </s>
<s> statement.  </s>
<s> Similarly, would also assign foo the the reification of the statement.  </s>
<s> Certainly this does change the meaning, but it changes it to be more consistent and brings it in line with what (IMO) the majority of RDF authors expect.  </s>
<s> I doubt that many (if any) RDF authors understand the current wackiness and even fewer have built documents on it.  </s>
