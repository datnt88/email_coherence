<s> Well, it still seems to be not quite there... 1) The sun/valid/out/optional.xml file needs to not end with a line break for the expected results comparison to work.  </s>
<s> This was either added by sending it as an attachment or introduced by a text editor, or perhaps even CVS, but the correct contents do not end with a line break.  </s>
<s> 2) The sun invalid test descriptions still reference the file sun/invalid/not-sa03.xml, which is now a not-wf test.  </s>
<s> The reference needs to be moved/removed as appropriate.  </s>
<s> 3) The ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml file is still referenced as a not-wf test despite being well-formed.  </s>
<s> As I mentioned in my previous note: "This file had been corrupted, see TS09 and TS13, but seems to have been fixed now.  </s>
<s> The test description needs to be changed back.  </s>

<s> As far as I know, this is used to uniquely identify a release of the test suite so that when someone says they conform to the suite you can ask them to tell you which version they are using.  </s>
<s> This information needs to be different any time there is a public release of any changes so that we can maintain some sanity in supporting this stuff.  </s>
