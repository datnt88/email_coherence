<s> Transformations  </s>
<s> Are transformations to be applied in the order specified?  </s>
<s> If the Transformations element is omitted, the only operation performed is the default c14n algorithm (null or identity).  </s>
<s> Am I correct in reading this as "the spec will eventually define a default c14n algorithm, which will be either null or identity"?  </s>
<s> I assume this same default will apply to SignedInfo when its c14nAlg is omitted?  </s>
<s> If so, language should be added to sec 4.0 or 4.1.  </s>

<s> The current consensus is that at the top level, the ObjectReferences in SignedInfo, core processing includes validating the digest.  </s>
<s> One motivation, among others, was that a core signature operation whose behavior does not include verifying that the item referenced is the item signed would be deficient at best.  </s>
<s> In building an application, you can have the ObjectReference point to a Manifest (or other document of your definition, such as a TTP request/response) which contains references to other objects.  </s>
<s> In this case, the core behavior would validate the digest on the Manifest, but not the referenced objects.  </s>

<s> We'll add the language to 4.1 for the SignedInfo default.  </s>

<s> There seemed to be reasons for allowing dsig applications to check signatures without checking integrity of the Objects - e.g. a scenario where a trusted third party can wittness the validity of signatures without knowing the signed content.  </s>
<s> The consensus was to check the digest of the objects indicated by signedobjectref.  </s>
<s> We perceived 'manifest' as just another object whose digest should be validated by core signature behavior.  </s>
<s> The manifest idea could then implement the feature you are interested in.  </s>
<s> Create a 'manifest' element listing the resources and their hashes.  </s>
<s> A signature would hash the manifest and digitally sign the hash.  </s>
<s> Verification would validate the integrity of the manifest element.  </s>
<s> It would then be the app's responsibility to validate or not validate the hashes it contains.  </s>
<s> The idea is that we need both methods.  </s>
<s> Obviously you understand the need for the manifest method.  </s>
<s> However, if we just had a method that validated manifests, then we could not say that core signature behavior was capable of validating the actual data that most people want to sign.  </s>
