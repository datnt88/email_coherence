<s> WRT 2001-10-12#2 - review the test cases in: for issue: 1. test001.rdf - since RDFS: already allows a property to have more than one domain, it's not clear if this TC is designed to verify that or is intended to reflect a WG decision.  </s>
<s> In either case the purpose of the test case should be included in the file.  </s>
<s> See attached test001.rdf  </s>
<s> 2. test002.rdf - looks OK.  </s>
<s> I added a Description and defined  </s>
<s> some Classes for the values of the range properties.  </s>
<s> See attached test002.rdf  </s>
<s> 3. I don't understand TC's test003.rdf and test004.rdf are supposed to test so I don't approve them.  </s>
<s> 4. axioms.n3 - I propose that NO N3 files get approved at this point.  </s>
<s> Attached are my re-workings of test00{1,2}.rdf and test00{1,2}.nt  </s>
<s> fine, I've updated that one, however without the 2 extra triples to "define some Classes" (see point 3.)  </s>
<s> idem  </s>
<s> Art, the idea was that and and rdfs-entails and some evidence for that can be found at  </s>
<s> and as you can see there is no need to "define some Classes" because that information can be RDFS entailed  </s>
<s> OK :-|  </s>
<s> Jos PS the $Id$ in the .rdf  </s>
<s> files doesn't seem to be evaluated (in the .nt  </s>
<s> it's ok)  </s>

<s> the issue resolution is - Multiple domain and range constraints are permissable and will have conjunctive semantics.  </s>
<s> so suppose we have ex:baz1 ex:bar ex:baz2 .  </s>
<s> #test003 and ex:bar rdfs:domain ex:Domain1 .  </s>
<s> #test001 and ex:bar rdfs:domain ex:Domain2 .  </s>
<s> #test001 then we can rdfs_entail ex:baz1 rdf:type ex:Domain1 .  </s>
<s> #test004 and ex:baz1 rdf:type ex:Domain2 .  </s>
<s> #test004 now, it is that last 'and' that expresses those 'conjunctive semantics' i.e. ex:baz1 in in the intersection of ex:Domain1 and ex:Domain2 the same story for rdfs:range  </s>
