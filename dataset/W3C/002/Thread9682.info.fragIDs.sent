<s> Summary: Some changes have been made to the RDF language (deletion of aboutEach*) and definition of terms (rdfs:domain, rdfs:range).  </s>
<s> This would normally call for a change of namespace URI's.  </s>
<s> If they are not changed, a strong case must be made.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> If it is in fact decided that the namespaces must change, I propose that there be a single new namespace for all RDF, RDFS, RDFD terms.  </s>
<s> A common source of typos and confusion for new users is keeping straight whether to use rdf: or rdfs: (and soon even rdfd:) etc. so I think that having a single namespace would be beneficial.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> I have a lot of sympathy for this idea, and I can't offhand think of any disadvantages.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> *If* we changed, I'd argue to put RDF 'model' and RDFS properties and classes in a common schema, and datatyping in a separate one.  </s>
<s> Unless we get rapid community buy-in on our datatyping design, which we're yet to see.  </s>
<s> Another namespace for syntactic constructs (rdf:about, rdf:resource) seems plausible and neater, though I don't see any great demand for it.  </s>
<s> That said, I don't think we should change the namespace.  </s>
<s> We should instead be clear about taking this seriously, and poll the tool and content creators whose work this will affect.  </s>
<s> My instint is that they'd support us staying with the old namespace URIs.  </s>

<s> agreed Jos  </s>
<s> I propose we close rdf-namespace-issue as follows.  </s>
<s> Is this enough to close the issue or does someone need to write the text  </s>
<s> for the specs?  </s>
<s> Anyway, this should be enough for discussion at a telecon.  </s>
<s> The RDF Core WG resolves... - that it does NOT intend to create new namespace URI references to name the RDF Schema namespace[1] and the RDF model/syntax namespace[2].  </s>
<s> - that we solicit feedback during Last Call from implementors and content producers on this decision, acknowledging that while there have been changes to the specs associated with [1] and [2], there are also significant costs associated with moving RDF to use new URIs.  </s>
<s> (@@ also ptr to charter which has nice words on this tension)  </s>
<s> - that we do not know at this stage whether the RDF Core specs will change further as a result of Last Call feedback, and consequently make for a more compelling case for namespace change.  </s>
<s> - that the final RDF Core RECommendations will set clearer expectations about the impact of subsequent revisions to RDF on the use of these namespaces.  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# [2] http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#  </s>
<s> I don't think so; I don't think it makes the case for why we should be able to keep the old namespace name even though we're changing the language.  </s>
<s> It suggests that there is a case to be made, but it doesn't make the case.  </s>
<s> I'd like to help write it, but I'm not in a good position just now.  </s>
<s> perhaps pasting those words in is a step forward.  </s>
<s> That's another promise that I'd like fullfilled before we close the issue.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> I agree with all below; have no time to spend on this right now.  </s>
<s> I'll bookmark this for next time... My action was, I believe, to propose closure.  </s>
<s> I withdraw from any aspirations to do so; I sketch a path towards closure (below); the final RDFS tweaks before publication may make a little progress on this, but no promises.  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> I was fine with this until I noticed DanC's comment.  </s>
<s> Here's some suggested extra text to replace your first point: - that it does NOT intend to create new namespace URI references to name the RDF Schema namespace[1] and the RDF model/syntax namespace[2].  </s>
<s> Although there have been changes to the definition of some RDF vocabulary in this namespace, we believe the changes do not change the meaning of any existing RDF for which there is an unambiguous and widely-used meaning.  </s>
