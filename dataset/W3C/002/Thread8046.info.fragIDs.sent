<s> RFC 2518 is silent on cookies.  </s>
<s> It requires support for RFC2068 (now RFC2616), but does not reference the HTTP Cookie RFC (RFC 2965).  </s>
<s> Some WebDAV servers, however, rely on setting cookies to keep a session for an unauthenticated user.  </s>
<s> For Basic authentication, cookies can vastly reduce the number of times a nearly-clear-text password is sent over the network, so cookies can make the interaction more secure.  </s>
<s> Session cookies are less secure than Digest authentication, however servers with low security requirements and high performance requirements may prefer to use cookies.  </s>
<s> In addition to being used for keeping sessions, cookies may be used to keep track of other client preferences (this is theoretical as I do not know of any actual examples).  </s>
<s> Thus, it was proposed that RFC2518 bis reference RFC2965, and say that  </s>
<s> "clients SHOULD support cookies".  </s>
<s> Discuss? Lisa  </s>
<s> My first impression is that I wouldn't want anything stronger than this.  </s>
<s> It doesn't seem like something that's strictly required.  </s>
<s> Just something that appears to be prudent in a quality product.  </s>

<s> Adding a "SHOULD" requirement that client authors implement a separate 26-page RFC would not appear to be prudent in a quality protocol spec.  </s>

<s> I agree with Stefan (i.e. that nothing about cookies should appear in 2518bis), for the reasons he states, unless I hear a compelling argument for why clients should be required to accept cookies in order for WebDAV to work properly.  </s>

<s> I generally agree with the previous posts in this thread - against cookies, or at least the language above being included in RFC2518 bis.  </s>
<s> Aside from the other reasons brought up previously, cookies break the REST architectural model.  </s>
<s> Rather than further entrench their use, it would be nice for WebDAV to help move HTTP away from the use of cookies.  </s>

<s> I also strongly oppose any mention of cookies, and would vehemently oppose any proposal that clients SHOULD support cookies with WebDAV.  </s>
<s> In addition to all the very good arguments mentioned so far, I would add that the cookie spec *requires* providing explicit user control of the use of cookies.  </s>
<s> This means that clients which support cookies have to support a whole bunch of UI that has arguably nothing to do with distributed authoring, either complicating their user model or forcing them to tie together the use of their client with the use of a browser (where cookie control UI typically lives).  </s>
<s> By the way, Adobe has yet to test against a WebDAV server that does cookie-based authentication that did not (in our view) start out with some serious security holes.  </s>
<s> Even our own implementations, for use with servers that provided Web-based UIs, took months to get to a reasonably-secure place.  </s>
<s> If I were to advocate that the spec say anything about cookies, it would be that servers SHOULD NOT use cookies as an authentication mechanism.  </s>
<s> dan  </s>
<s> Consensus on requiring clients to accept cookies is quite clear: we should NOT require WebDAV clients to accept or use cookies.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the text in RFC2518 (silent on cookies) is sufficient and nothing needs to be added.  </s>
<s> lisa  </s>
<s> I also agree that WebDAV should say nothing about cookies.  </s>
<s> We don't have any plans to add support for cookies to our client.  </s>
