<s> This actually makes the example of the size property even more meaningful, as it shows the ambiguity even more clearly.  </s>
<s> Since there is no single derived type "responsible" for disambiguation, there is no explicit means to decide *which* range should be used to interpret the non-locally typed literal.  </s>

<s> True, but this seems to be a general problem with any datatyping scheme, even the URV idea.  </s>
<s> If I use a URV with a 'unioned' type name, something has to be able to fit the right part of the datatype mapping with the particular lexical form it finds itself combined with.  </s>
