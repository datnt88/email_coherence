<s> [In reading this note, I have found it sounds negative.  </s>
<s> My experience with Tidy and HTML, though frustrating at times, has been quite positive.  </s>
<s> I am impressed with both.]  </s>
<s> I'm new to HTML and hate to bother you with questions or suggestions you have no doubt received many times.  </s>
<s> Do you have a list of Frequently Asked Questions that I could look over ?  </s>
<s> My second question concerns "Flowing text around images" in the Advanced part of your Introduction.  </s>
<s> The br clear="all" tag is used but not explained, and I have no idea where to look for it.  </s>
<s> Somewhere in this  </s>
<s> overwhelming amount of hyper-linked stuff on HTML there must be a lookup table for br ... and for clear="all".  </s>
<s> Can you tell me where to find it ?  </s>
<s> (I really have tried.  </s>
<s> My Sam's Teach Yourself HTML4 (Sec.  </s>
<s> Ed.) shows br but doesn't discuss 'clear', and the values "none" and "all" could use some explaining, for example why 'none' doesn't signify canceling the br !) My third question concerns the command line.  </s>
<s> My first use of Tidy was frustrating because the file I directed errors to using -f came up with 0 bytes, even though I already knew of several errors/warnings and Tidy found 12 on a later run.  </s>
<s> I didn't use -m on the command line because I wanted to look at the original text with the error list to match line numbers.  </s>
<s> I expected to ignore the stdout output.  </s>
<s> On the later run, I safe-copied the file and used -m, which got me the Tidy'd output and the error list, but it quickly became obvious that the line numbers were indeed those on the (lost) original text.  </s>
<s> So my third question is "Why was the error output file empty ?", and  </s>
<s> my fourth question is "How do you recommend relating the error messages to the Tidy'd code ?  </s>
<s> I am as much interested in furthering my education  </s>
<s> now as I will be in simply getting robust HTML code later on, and line numbers on a long (altered) text would save a lot of unnecessary scanning.  </s>
<s> I suppose my fifth question is "Would you consider adding a command line option to show relevant line numbers in the Tidy'd text, perhaps in !  </s>
<s> ...  comment form ?".  </s>
<s> My fifth question is "Why did Tidy erase my comment lines ?". I have  </s>
<s> learned the hard lesson about documenting my code, but Tidy cleaned out my implementation and futures notes !  </s>
<s> My final question is a reaction to the difficulties of printing a hyperlinked text, even one as simply-linked as your excellent Introduction to HTML.  </s>
<s> Is there some way to print (e.g.) the HTML  </s>
<s> standard in one pass ?  </s>
<s> Is there a one-file version available anywhere ?  </s>
<s> You're doing great work.  </s>
<s> I hope these questions don't take too much time away from your constructive efforts.  </s>
<s> Thanks, R. Keir  </s>
<s> The archives of the HTML Tidy mailing list are at: ...and they may be searched for particular content.  </s>
<s> However, if you're new to HTML, then you will likely wish to augment your reading of this list, which specifically concerns the operation of the HTML Tidy program, with one dedicated to general HTML questions.  </s>
<s> For example, the USENET news group: comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html  </s>
<s> ...would be directly targeted to your HTML questions.  </s>
<s> There are a number of HTML resources on the Web.  </s>
<s> The primary source is the HTML specification itself.  </s>
<s> For example, the HTML 4.01 Specification is available at: ...and the BR element is described at: (The index of the full specification lists all of the elements, such as BR, and attributes, such as CLEAR.) Other useful HTML resources are at:  </s>
<s> My first use of Tidy was frustrating because the file I directed errors to using -f came up with 0 bytes, even though I already knew of several errors/warnings and Tidy found 12 on a later run.  </s>
<s> What specific command line did you use?  </s>
<s> Using, e.g.: tidy -f t.err t.html ...will indeed write errors and warnings to the "t.err" file, and will write the tidied markup to the screen.  </s>
<s> Personally, I load the file to be tidied into a text editor that provides the position of the cursor (i.e., row and column) in its status line.  </s>
<s> Alternately, I use FrontPage (carefully!  </s>
<s> :-), as its "HTML view" also reports the cursor location.  </s>
<s> So when Tidy gives me an error, I can locate the offending construct from the location information reported.  </s>
<s> I'll defer that question to Tidy's author.  </s>
<s> I have not observed that Tidy removes comments.  </s>
<s> Were your comments syntactically correct?  </s>
<s> Note that one of Tidy's jobs is to make invalid HTML valid, so if you have a malformed comment, Tidy could make the file valid either by correcting the comment or by removing it.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the latter is happening?  </s>
<s> At the top of the HTML 4.01 Specification (see the preceding link) are links to versions of the standard in various formats.  </s>
<s> For printing, I would recommend obtaining either the PDF or Postscript versions.  </s>
<s> You're welcome.  </s>

<s> My first use of Tidy was frustrating because the file I directed errors to using -f came up with 0 bytes, even though I already knew of several errors/warnings and Tidy found 12 on a later run.  </s>
<s> There were some previous versions of Tidy (on most platforms) that had a bug that caused an empty errors file to be created - the current 04 Aug 00 version does not have that bug.  </s>
<s> Also I have noticed that the order of the arguments on the command line can make a difference when involving error files - I defer to Dave that his example above as being the correct way; you should check for yourself to see if order matters for you.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>
