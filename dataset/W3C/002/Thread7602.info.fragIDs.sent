<s> Given the *current* spec :-), has anybody noticed that you can actually have a locknull resource that does not have any *direct* locks on it?  </s>
<s> For example: Establish a locknull as /a/b with a shared lock.  </s>
<s> Now, lock /a with a Depth: infinity lock, shared.  </s>
<s> Finally, unlock /a/b with the first locktoken.  </s>

<s> Thanks Greg.  </s>
<s> I've added that scenario to the list of locking issues.  </s>
<s> This isn't perhaps that unexpected.  </s>
<s> If one models the lifecycle of a resource as a finite state machine, then it goes from non-existant (i.e., a reference to resource whose current state is undefined) to lock-null on LOCK.  </s>
<s> More locks leave it in this state.  </s>
<s> It only leaves this state and goes back to non-existant if there are no more locks.  </s>
<s> A PUT moves it from the lock-null state to the existing-resource state, etc. Greg Stein gstein@lyra.org on 11/11/99 07:58:06 PM Subject: locknull resources Given the *current* spec :-), has anybody noticed that you can actually have a locknull resource that does not have any *direct* locks on it?  </s>
