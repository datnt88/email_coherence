<s> Another charter item which isn't met yet, and with no progress in 5  </s>
<s> years, is the ACL goals document.  </s>
<s> Attention went from goals to specification and never returned.  </s>
<s> The ACL  </s>
<s> specification may no longer be very much in line with the goals  </s>
<s> document any more (somebody would have to reread the goals document to  </s>
<s> see).  </s>
<s> It doesn't really matter because events left the goals document behind.  </s>
<s> The main reason for the goals document to be standardized would have been to enforce some process on getting ACL itself to RFC but that's done now anyway.  </s>
<s> So, to perform good housekeeping on our charter, does anybody object to  </s>
<s> simply removing this goal from the charter?  </s>
<s> Again, feedback and discussion within 2 weeks would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
