Hi 
I just checked out my personnel web site with www.echoecho.com it said Error: unknown attribute "HEIGHT" for element tr . 
even though this passes by tidy and it is my HTML book maybe http://www.echoecho.com/ is wrong

Hi Eric, 
It doesn't look like HTML allows a "height" attribute on tr . 
I checked the HTML 4.01 and 3.2 specs. 
So echoecho is right. 
As for Tidy, there is a known problem with its checking of illegal attributes. 
The problem is that in most cases, Tidy does not check attributes on a per-element basis. 
Because "height" is allowed on certain other elements like img and object , Tidy ends up allowing it on ALL elements. 
And your HTML book seems to be wrong. 
Unfortunately, many HTML books contain mistakes like this.

Pixels have no unites in HTML, that'd be 
See http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#edef-TR 
Tidy is wrong for HTML 4.01 documents. 
Tidy should warn about the illegal value and the HTML beeing proprietary where the latter would be hard to implement.

Also, as far as I've heard, tr doesn't have a height attribute.
