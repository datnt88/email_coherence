I am an ignorant newbie that usies NoteTab for text editing and basic HTML coding. 
Note Tab has an option to "Tidy HTML" that apparently uses the program tidy.exe but I can't figure out how to get tidy.exe. 
I went to SourceForge.net and downloaded SOMETHING, but Windows 98 doesn't recognize it as an executable. 
What am I doing wrong???

Well, what *exactly* did you download? 
There's a whole bunch of stuff at sourceforge, some of it entirely inappropriate for the Windows environment (as with many things there). 
Try http://tidy.sourceforge.net/trt/tidy_win32.zip , which you'll need to unzip. 
That should, at least, get you an executable, albeit a little out-of-date (July last year). 
Or maybe Notetab is looking for a DLL, in which case go looking at http://htmltrim.sourceforge.net/tidy.html . 
Here you'll also find the latest (month-old) version. 
Download tidy-exe.zip 
from http://htmltrim.sourceforge.net/tidy.html 
and uncompress the file using your favourite zip tool, http://www.winzip.com for example.
