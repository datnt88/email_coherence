<s> Hi Joseph, Firstly, the correspondence cited was not restricted to having a node-set containing one node for each element of the document, as claimed by the author of the response below.  </s>
<s> It had to do with the fact that the result of id() is indeed 'exfoliated' and, because of a syntactic limitation of XPath, one must create an expression which generates one node for every node in the document, then filter down to element E and its descendants (including namespace and attribute nodes).  </s>
<s> More importantly, the author is also incorrect in his assertion that there is no evidence in XPath to support the assertion of an 'exfoliated' node-set result from the id() function.  </s>
<s> My opinion is based on [1] as well as email received from James Clark and Steve DeRose (the editors of the XPath specification).  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#function-id  </s>
<s> The Xpath specification is quite clear about the meaning of the id function [1].  </s>
<s> According to [1], the result of the id function is a node-set containing the element(s) matching the identifier(s) given by the function's input parameter.  </s>
<s> A single identifier results in a node-set containing a single element.  </s>
<s> The output node-set does not contain the element node plus its descendants plus all of the namespace and attribute nodes of these elements.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, the problem remains one of how to think about and hence process a node-set.  </s>
<s> If a node-set is a set of nodes, then the result of id("E") is insufficient to indicate the desire for a textual rendering of E and all of its content, namespace declarations and attributes.  </s>
<s> Only by interpreting a node-set as something other than a set of nodes-- specifically, a subtree-root-set-- does id("E") become sufficient.  </s>

<s> There is no debate that the referent of a barename XPointer == XPath id() function is a nodeset consisting of a single element node (or none).  </s>
<s> It would be incoherent for it to be otherwise -- the nodeset  </s>
<s> refered to by an expression consists of those nodes which satisfy the expression, and e.g. the children of a node with id 'foo' cannot also have id 'foo', so by definition cannot be part of the referent of id(foo).  </s>
<s> What _is_ at issue is what the meaning of this single-element nodeset is.  </s>
<s> In the first instance, it means that element node is the referent of the relevant XPointer.  </s>
<s> The spec. is at pains to point out that  </s>
<s> XPointers don't _return_ anything, they _point_ to things.  </s>
<s> And in the XPath data model, just like the Infoset, when you point at something, you implicitly point at everything you can access from it.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> language and the principle are no different from e.g. fragment identifiers for text/html -- they point to the element with the relevant 'name' attribute, but if you GET them you get the subtree rooted there.  </s>

<s> Hi Henry, Yes, what is very much at issue is how to interpret a node in a node-set.  </s>
<s> However, the assertion that a node in a node-set is meant to indicate "point at everything you can access from it" is flawed on two counts: 1) every node in the entire document is accessible from any node in the document.  </s>
<s> 2) your intent in making this statement is to have each node be representative of the subtree for which it is the root.  </s>
<s> This is a subset of what is reachable from the node, but more importantly it defies the use of the term 'set'.  </s>
<s> The XPath spec is quite clear about the fact that a node-set contains no duplicates.  </s>
<s> If the intended meaning of 'node' is 'self plus all descendants including namespaces and attributes', then it should be impossible for me to produce a node-set containing an element and a child of that element since the child is already implicitly included by virtue of including its parent.  </s>
<s> Current implementations permit a child to be a node-set with its parent, substantiating the view of node-set as a 'set of nodes', not a set of subtree roots.  </s>
<s> Moreover, the view that xpointers 'point to things' rather than 'return things' has little to do with the problem and serves only to cloud the issue.  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, the XPath specification says "Each function in the function library is specified using a function prototype, which gives the return type...", which substantiates the view that the id() function *returns* a node-set.  </s>
<s> So, XPointer's claim that "XPointers don't _return_ anything, they _point_ to things" simply means that they return a node-set that 'points to' or indicates certain nodes (locations in the case of Xpointer).  </s>
<s> However, the problem is and has always been about what do you do with the 'pointer'?  </s>
<s> What does it mean to 'dereference' the pointer.  </s>
<s> Applications of XPath and XPointer are free to define what they intend to do with the output  </s>
<s> result of the XPath or Xpointer expression.  </s>
<s> In the case of XPath, I have interpreted the node-set as a set of nodes because that's what the W3C chose to call it and because that's how XPath expression evaluators act.  </s>
<s> So, within XPath serialization and c14n, the act of dereferencing a node-set produces the text of precisely and only those nodes that are actually in the node-set.  </s>
<s> There is no substantiation within XPath to interpret a node-set as a  </s>
<s> subtree-root-set because a node and its child can appear in the node-set.  </s>
<s> Finally, the emails from DeRose [1] and Clark [2] are in the dsig archive.  </s>
<s> [1] [2] They are about the interpretation of an expression like id("E")/descendant-or-self::node() which will only produce a node-set containing E and its descendant elements, PIs, comments, and text, but will exclude the namespace and attribute nodes of E and its descendant elements.  </s>
<s> In your prior email [3], you used the term 'exfoliated', by which one must assume you meant that you found no evidence that id("E") would produce a result that was devoid of the descendants, namespaces and attributes of E. My reference those emails from Clark and DeRose was intended to substantiate the point that indeed the result of id("E") is 'exfoliated' and further that, by design, the namespace and attribute nodes are omitted from descendant class axes (which also implicitly substantiates the viewpoint that one should create a node-set indicating a node AND its descendants when one INTENDS TO indicate or 'point to' the node AND its descendants).  </s>

<s> Hi Henry, Actually, there isn't much doom and gloom going on, and we seem to be doing better than being close to a resolution.  </s>
<s> We already have a number of  </s>
<s> resolutions.  </s>
<s> All of this began very simply when I pointed out a necessary correction to the dsig spec because there was a difference between what the xpath expression id("E") returns versus what our spec claimed would be the serialized result.  </s>
<s> Most of what you wrote below explains the basic notions of XPath, which I have been actively working with for almost a year now.  </s>
<s> There is no confusion on my part regarding these basic issues, and I have indeed written  </s>
<s> much of the same material in recent emails.  </s>
<s> However, I would disagree on one minor point: the definition of string-value does not provide a definition of subtree that includes namespace and attribute nodes.  </s>
<s> Please look again at the definition of string value, especially the string-value description for element nodes [1], which states that the string value of an element is the concatenation of the string values of its *text node descendants*.  </s>
<s> In other words, no visitation of namespace and attribute nodes is performed by the string-value DFS algorithm.  </s>
<s> This entire thread would have been very small if namespace and attribute nodes were included in descendancy because we could've just serialized the node-set result of id("E")/descendant-or-self::node() Despite this minor point, I am glad that you (and Daniel Veillard [2]) agree that applications are free to use node-sets in any way that is convenient, since I believe it makes the most sense for the purpose of serializing or canonicalizing XML to treat a node-set as a set of nodes, where inclusion in the set means inclusion in the textual output, and exclusion from the set means exclusion from the textual output.  </s>
<s> The major source of our prior disagreement seems to have been the assertion that a node-set should always indicate subtree roots, which was not justified by subsequent comments that Xpointers are pointers taht indicate what is accessible (since everything is accessible from any point in the tree).  </s>
<s> Furthermore, as I pointed out to the dsig group yesterday, and with which you indicate agreement below, we are free to define the XPointer URI="#E" as  </s>
<s> indicating E plus all nodes that have E as an ancestor.  </s>
<s> In other words, subtree(id("E")).  </s>
<s> This segues nicely to my final question.  </s>
<s> As I pointed out in prior emails, the actual XPath expression that corresponds to the above definition of URI="#E" is somewhat clumsy, but it is possible to say what we mean to say in an XPath expression.  </s>
<s> This is why I claim that we do not, in fact, have a doom-and-gloom problem.  </s>
<s> However, you made the statement that defining a subtree() function would "be counterproductive, as that function flattens the tree and loses information in doing so."  </s>
<s> Notwithstanding Dan Veillard's comments to the contrary [2], I do not think this is the case.  </s>
<s> When we create a node-set containing the entire subtree, the document order of the nodes retains the information necessary for us to create a canonical form or a serialization that can be passed to a digest algorithm (where document order for namespace and attribute nodes is defined by sorting [3, 4]).  </s>
<s> Could you please explain if this does not adequately address your concern about a flattened tree?  </s>
<s> In conclusion, then, I really do not think we disagree on much if anything now that we have both familiarized ourselves with the other's position.  </s>
