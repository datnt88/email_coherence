<s> This closes action: 2002-02-26#12 DaveB Propose n-triples changes to represent the new form of rdf literals.  </s>
<s> in F2F minutes http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020225-f2f/  </s>
<s> During the F2F I was actioned to come up with a syntax to support the structured literal form we agreed.  </s>
<s> I discussed this with Dan Connolly what we could do and we agreed something like the following was sufficient:  </s>
<s> xml(" b foo /b ") XML content, no language xml(" b foo /b ", "en") XML content, language given "en"  </s>
<s> "chat" Unicode string, no language "chat"-en Unicode string, language given as "en" Features: * Makes all existing literals legal * Provides only one way to encoded the literal-structures and so in that sense is canonical.  </s>
<s> In order to try this out, I've implemented the above in my N-Triples parser, and it works just fine.  </s>
<s> Issues: 1. "chat"-en might not be good enough if languages can contain whitespace or other things (I need to check the RFCs) Solution if this is needed: "chat"-"en" 2. Want one way to describe all literal structures: Solution: literal(unicode string value, unicode string language, boolean isXML) and define the abbreviated forms in terms of that 3. I assume "chat" != "chat"-"" (need to check language RFCs) Solution if this is needed: Restrict the language string to always 1+ chars I'm propose to change the N-Triples specification to have this notation unless specific problems are raised with it.  </s>

<s> Jeremy Carroll said:  </s>
<s> Can't be (a) since the "" content is just a sequence of characters.  </s>
<s> Oh, that's interesting.  </s>
<s> I had been assuming that it was well-balanced xml.  </s>
<s> No, that's why I posted the proposed new productions to make it quite clear:  </s>
<s> langString ::= '"' string '"' ('-' language) xmlString ::= 'xml' langString  </s>
<s> and in the existing grammar at http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#string string ::= character* with escapes as defined in section Strings  </s>
<s> Legal - yes, this changed NTriples doesn't care.  </s>
<s> However: the NTriples that are generated from RDF/XML will *not* generate such a literal.  </s>
<s> If we went with xmlString ::= 'xml"' xmlExclusiveC14Nstring '"' ('-' language) xmlExclusiveC14Nstring ::= as defined by http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-exc-c14n then there would be further requirements  </s>
<s> That's fine.  </s>
<s> If that's the case then:  </s>
<s> b) legal but different from xml(" b foo /b ") (and not representable in RDF/XML?)  </s>
<s> looks like the attractive answer to my question.  </s>
<s> It is an answer from my current defn :) Dave  </s>
<s> I'm happy with this.  </s>
<s> The 'xml' is more mnemonic than '1'.  </s>
<s> Should we consider the '-' separator as superfluous?  </s>
