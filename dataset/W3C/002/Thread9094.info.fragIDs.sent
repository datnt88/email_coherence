Is there any

Sorry, I was not aware of that. 
We are retaining 'shorthand pointer' as the normative term, but now define it using: A shorthand pointer, formerly known as a barename, consists of an NCName alone. 
Please let us know as soon as possible if this is unsatisfactory, as we are scheduled for a PR review this coming week.
