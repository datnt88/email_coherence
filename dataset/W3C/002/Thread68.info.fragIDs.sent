<s> Hi, I'm trying to use JTidy to convert HTML to XHTML.  </s>
<s> I had trouble installing JTidy and had to change the batch file to complete the install (I've attached my updated version).  </s>
<s> When I run the test program from the JTidy  </s>
<s> website, 'code example of using Java Tidy as a parser', on any web page it  </s>
<s> spits back 6/7 errors and real bad HTML code.  </s>
<s> The worst error I get is 'unexpected /head tag in meta tag'.  </s>
<s> This is the cause of the garbage HTML created by JTidy.  </s>
<s> I think either the install went wrong or my config settings are wrong.  </s>
<s> During the install, the .properties  </s>
<s> file wasn't created so I just copied it  </s>
<s> from the download.  </s>
<s> I havnen't changed the config settings since install.  </s>
<s> Could you please send me some suggestions as to how to get it working.  </s>
<s> Thanks David Hinshelwood CRL NMSU (505) 645 5537 (home)  </s>
<s> David -- It's a little hard from your email to determine exactly what your configuration looks like.  </s>
<s> Basically, all you should need to actually run JTidy, I think, is the Tidy.jar file which is included in the  </s>
<s> distribution.  </s>
<s> Make sure that it is specified in your CLASSPATH.  </s>
<s> Can you send me privately the URL or the actual text of a web page that is giving you these "unexpected /head ..." messages.  </s>
<s> I'll run it here and see if I have the same problem.  </s>
<s> We can go from there and determine if the problem is in JTidy or your setup.  </s>

<s> David -- Okay, I see what you mean now.  </s>
<s> First of all, I set up Tidy on my own by just extracting everything from the zip file and that seemed to work just fine.  </s>
<s> I think your installation is working fine also.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the example that you're using, 'code example of using Java Tidy as a parser' from the JTidy page, has the following line in it: tidy.setXmlTags(true);  </s>
<s> This means that the _input_ is XML so that is what Tidy is expecting.  </s>
<s> However, your input is HTML, not XML.  </s>
<s> Either comment out or delete the line and you'll see much better results.  </s>
<s> You'll get a lot more errors but they'll be legitimate errors in your page.  </s>
<s> You might also try substituting the line tidy.setXHTML(true);  </s>
<s> This tells Tidy to _output_ XHTML although I'm not sure what effect that has when your using the pretty printer in the TestDOM class in the example rather than the built-in one inside Tidy.  </s>
<s> To use that one, and bypass all of this other coding, change t.print(tidy.parseDOM(in,  </s>
<s> null)); to tidy.parseDOM(in, System.out);  </s>
<s> HTH, Gary  </s>
