<s> Are there permissible implementation differences that are not covered off by throwing a c14n transform after (or before and after)?  </s>
<s> Or rather, is there an XSLT conformance mode that guarantees any implementation adhering to that mode produces the exact same output (except possibly for differences that can be corrected by c14n, and possibly only if the input is canonicalized)?  </s>
<s> Or is it the case, for example, that random extra whitespace may be added outside of start tags by some processors and not by others?  </s>

<s> The XSLT spec requires XSLT processors to create a "result tree".  </s>
<s> How and whether an XSLT processor writes the "result tree" is up to the processor itself.  </s>
<s> After processing with XSLT and before signing, applications SHOULD canonicalize the output from the result tree.  </s>

<s> For example you can say that you want some items sorted, and can indicate that the sort order should be according to e.g. Swedish practices, but you are not guaranteed that your processor knows Swedish sorting, nor are you sure that all processors do exactly the same for Swedish even if they know it.  </s>

<s> I think the question to ask is "Given a result tree, is it possible to correctly write out two different XML streams such that the canonicalized form of the streams are different?"  </s>
<s> If the W3C (including ourselves) have done things right, the answer should be "No.  </s>
<s> A result tree has only one canonical form associated with it." (Admittedly, I'd like to think more about this question but my standards time is kind of pre-occupied on the encryption front right now.) Just like the IETF interop testing uncovered some subtle parser nuances that need refinement, I expect there will be similar discoveries with XSLT tools.  </s>
<s> Let's face it, because digital signatures must be absolutely 100% unforgiving to any discrepancy (as they must be), bringing digital signatures to the world of XML will be a very effective way of flushing out bugs in both XML-related specs and the tools built on those specs.  </s>
