<s> Dear Folks, One of my users has reported a problem when tidying his XHTML on the Mac platform.  </s>
<s> I have since reproduced his problem with the Windows versions of Tidy, so this is a non-platform specific problem that I look to your advice on.  </s>

<s> Hello Terry, Tidy is right about what it's doing - the input file does not appear to be valid XHTML 1.0.  </s>
<s> I used the WDG Validator [http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/direct.html] because it allows direct HTML input, while the W3C Validator [http://validator.w3.org/] only allows URL and uploaded File validation, yet I believe them to be fairly identical.  </s>
<s> Please see following snippets from the reference: "Empty elements must either have an end tag or the start tag must end with / .  </s>
<s> For instance, br/ or hr /hr ."  </s>
<s> [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.6] "Include a space before the trailing / and  of empty elements, e.g. br / , hr / and img src="karen.jpg"  </s>
<s> alt="Karen" / .  </s>
<s> Also, use the minimized tag syntax for empty elements, e.g. br / , as the alternative syntax br /br allowed by XML gives uncertain results in many existing user agents."  </s>
<s> [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines]  </s>
<s> The output file ALMOST validates, the validator still complains about the LEFTMARGIN and TOPMARGIN attributes in BODY.  </s>
<s> I have mentioned this before, it would be a very nice addition if tidy  </s>
<s> would allow to suppress "illegal" attributes.  </s>

<s> This seems a very important point.  </s>
<s> Some "deprecated" (lets not call the illegal) attributes can be hived off into stylesheets.  </s>
<s> But, as I posted earlier, I would like to raise the issue of whether Tidy should or should not "transform" deprecated attributes, or indeed elements themselves, into "recommended" forms.  </s>
<s> For me at least, the most important of these is embed and applet , both of which appear to require transformation to object (or possibly the little used or implemented iframe ).  </s>
<s> Once in XML of course, XSLT can be used to achieve further transformations.  </s>
<s> so, should one in general  suppress  or  transform  "illegal" attributes, elements and the like?  </s>

<s> Chemistry, Imperial College, London, SW7 2AY, UK.  </s>
<s> I believe there should be a configuration option to either "leave", "drop" or "transform to CSS" deprecated attributes.  </s>
<s> Most important to me is that tidy's output is VALID HTML, especially proprietary Microsoft Tags/Attributes should be simply dropped.  </s>
<s> Of course some people will disagree, that's why having this as a configurable option is desirable.  </s>
<s> SUGGESTION: fix-bad-attributes: leave, drop, convert If set to _drop_, deprecated attributes will be discarded.  </s>
<s> If set to _convert_, causes Tidy to replace deprecated attributes by appropriate style rules.  </s>
<s> The default is _leave_.  </s>
<s> REMARK: "deprecated" varies depending on the selected DTD, of course... (attributes that are deprecated in STRICT version might be compliant with the TRANSITIONAL version, and this should be recognized).  </s>
<s> Any comments or objections?  </s>
<s> sebastian  </s>
<s> Sounds great: Great solution, but also great effort to implement it: How do you convert undefined elements/attributes? :-) Seriously: Attributes and Elements can be deprecated, obsolete, known proprietary (e.g. M$ or NN) or unknown (typos, ...).  </s>
<s> Conversion for the first two classes would be great, for the third one: terrific, for the last one - impossible.  </s>

<s> so, should one in general  suppress  or  transform  "illegal" attributes, elements and the like?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Or rather, it all depends.  </s>
<s> On _which_ attribute, _why_ the HTML is being tidied, _whether_ an acceptable transformation exists, _what_ the output is to be used with.  </s>
<s> Obviously, if you have HTML-for-browser-foo using attributes that are specific to browser foo, and you want to use the tidied HTML with browser foo, a default behaviour of leaving non-standard attributes just the way they are is pretty much ideal.  </s>
<s> Equally obviously, if (as happens to be the case here), there are attributes you never wanted in the first place but the editor you use insists on putting them in, you want them deleted.  </s>
<s> Even more obviously, if there is important presentation information which _can_ be expressed in a standard way using style sheets, you'd like to do that (so that browser Bar can handle the file), but you might well want to keep the old attributes as well (so that old browser Foo, which can't handle CSS2 yet, can still render the file).  </s>
<s> It's the kind of problem options files are designed to help with.  </s>
