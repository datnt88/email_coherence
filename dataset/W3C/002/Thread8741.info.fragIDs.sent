<s> So the results of recent discussion on this topic were rather muddled/mixed which is not surprising given the state of the issue smile .  </s>
<s> Our own discussion was split [2] with some confusion regarding the meaning of "unspecified".  </s>
<s> Additionally, the brief discussion at the XML Plenary meeting didn't give us an inescapable argument either [1].  </s>
<s> However, I think John's recently analysis [2,c] is delightfully unmuddled (just two variables and their enumeration).  </s>
<s> I'm not of a strong technical  </s>
<s> opinion either way (I've flip-flopped a few times), and my interest in this is much more at the meta-level that the following two requirements be met: 1.  </s>
<s> That the conformance requirements and expectations regarding Canonical XML and its applications be straightforward.  </s>
<s> Even if this means being aggressive with considering things in or out of scope we need to ensure a developer can understand and implement the spec in an interoperable way as easily as possible.  </s>
<s> 2. The way in which we should respect the Plenary Decision is by not requiring XML processors to do things counter to the Plenary Decision.  </s>
<s> Consequently, from a procedural point of view, in order to bring this issue to a close, we need to opt for one of these options and ask for opposition.  </s>
<s> So given the previous discussion and John's proposal of: go with Choice #1 as it is specified above, i.e. REQUIRE implementers to A) not use Type 1 processors, B) generate errors if Type 2 processor used and non-absolute namespace URI found, or C) use a Type 3 processor.  </s>
<s> [2,c] please express your acceptance of this proposal or opposition (and reason why) by Wednesday October 27th.  </s>
