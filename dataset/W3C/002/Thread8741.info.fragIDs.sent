So the results of recent discussion on this topic were rather muddled/mixed which is not surprising given the state of the issue smile . 
Our own discussion was split [2] with some confusion regarding the meaning of "unspecified". 
Additionally, the brief discussion at the XML Plenary meeting didn't give us an inescapable argument either [1]. 
However, I think John's recently analysis [2,c] is delightfully unmuddled (just two variables and their enumeration). 
I'm not of a strong technical 
opinion either way (I've flip-flopped a few times), and my interest in this is much more at the meta-level that the following two requirements be met: 1. 
That the conformance requirements and expectations regarding Canonical XML and its applications be straightforward. 
Even if this means being aggressive with considering things in or out of scope we need to ensure a developer can understand and implement the spec in an interoperable way as easily as possible. 
2. The way in which we should respect the Plenary Decision is by not requiring XML processors to do things counter to the Plenary Decision. 
Consequently, from a procedural point of view, in order to bring this issue to a close, we need to opt for one of these options and ask for opposition. 
So given the previous discussion and John's proposal of: go with Choice #1 as it is specified above, i.e. REQUIRE implementers to A) not use Type 1 processors, B) generate errors if Type 2 processor used and non-absolute namespace URI found, or C) use a Type 3 processor. 
[2,c] please express your acceptance of this proposal or opposition (and reason why) by Wednesday October 27th.

Martin Duerst (adhere to plenary decision and motivation) b. Mark Bartel (2 adds extra requirements) However, also states that this doesn't require a fail, just that it won't interoperate. 
c. Boyer (Easiest on implementation/conformance front) Option 2 Interpret as String. 
a. Petteri Stenius (Meaning we don't try to interprate the values) b. Gregor Karlinger (We don't bother with URIs beyond treating them as string) c. Merlin Hughes (1 requires us to understand what a URI is) d.

Joseph, this proposal is fine with me.

Hello Joseph, I fully agree to go with your and John's conclusions. 
Regards, Martin.
