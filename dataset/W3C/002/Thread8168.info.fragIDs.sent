<s> PM Subject: RE: Issue: IS_HREF_A_CHILD_OF_KEEPALIVE  </s>
<s> There is a much deeper issue with keepalive, and that is that no client at the interop claimed to use the feature.  </s>
<s> Therefore interoperability has not been, and cannot easily be, demonstrated.  </s>
<s> Are there now clients out there that can demonstrate that keepalive works?  </s>
<s> Or is it one of those ideas that just isn't useful enough to clients for them to implement?  </s>
<s> If its not useful enough for clients to implement, then it should be removed from WebDAV so the protocol can go to the next phase of standardization.  </s>

<s> We originally envisioned that there would be servers with multiple sets of live properties active in different parts of its namespace, in which case it was unclear how to handle the semantics of a COPY from one live property space to another.  </s>
<s> Keepalive was designed to make these copies more predictable from the client side.  </s>
<s> But, these kinds of servers aren't prevalent, and it's not clear that clients really want these semantics anyway.  </s>
<s> The lack of adoption speaks volumes.  </s>
<s> I'm in favor of dumping it -- a later extension could add it back in, if desired.  </s>
