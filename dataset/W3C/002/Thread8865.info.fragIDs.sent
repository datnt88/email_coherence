Hi folks, Yongge Wang and I have taken a cut at extending the DSIG syntax to allow ECDSA. 
(See the I-D referenced below.) We'd like to solicit comments from anyone in the group that can find time to look ... in particular, did we do the extension correctly, etc. 
We're hoping that if we can get the extension mechanism correct, our work could help people who come along later and want to add support for other alogrithms ... Best regards.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories. 
Title : ECDSA with XML-Signature Syntax Author(s) : S. Blake-Wilson, Y. Wang Filename : draft-blake-wilson-xmldsig-ecdsa-00.txt 
Pages : 7 Date : 14-Nov-00 This document specifies how to use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with the XML-digital signature syntax. 
The mechanism specified provides integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that includes the signature or included by reference. 
A URL for this Internet-Draft is: Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. 
Login with the username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. 
After logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then "get draft-blake-wilson-xmldsig-ecdsa-00.txt". 
A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

In the body type: "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-blake-wilson-xmldsig-ecdsa-00.txt". 
NOTE: The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility. 
To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command. 
To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader. 
Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages. 
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft.

This draft doesn't contain any examples yet, so it's fairly hard to critique, or test against. 
It did take a while to do the examples for PKCS-1. 
This may be an ignorant comment by someone who is far from being an XML guru, but I didn't see a revised version of the Schema definition of KeyValue incorporating ECDSAKeyValue, which would naturally go in there.

Hi Tom, Sorry for the delay ... I wanted to get back to the office and consult with our XML expert before responding! 
Thanks for the comments. 
We're working on some examples, and are planning to post them as a separate document. 
I'm not sure how we left out the updated schema for KeyValue ... we've added it now and are planning to wait a little while to see if any more comments come in before we post it. 
Thanks again.

Hi, Tom, Does this example make sense? 
I have tried to open it with the IBM XML Viewer, it seems ok... Note that I used the option: !DOCTYPE Signature SYSTEM "xmldsig-core-schema.dtd" ..... 
and the file xmldsig-core-schema.dtd was downloaded from and this file contains an error: line 109 should be: !ELEMENT SignatureProperty %SignatureProperty.ANY; 
(The last ; is missed in the downloaded file).

Ok, fixed in editors' copy: (Unfortunatley, the tool I use to validate DTDs (XMetal Rules Maker) doesn't catch these errors.) Joseph Reagle Jr. W3C Policy Analyst mailto:reagle@w3.org

Thank you. 
I would remove the "X509Certificate" from the example, as it isn't necessary with both SubjectName and IssuerSerial present, and the value given seems far too short.

Hi, Tom, thanks for your comments... 
I will rewrite the example and contruct some authentic values... (the values in the previous example is just some garbage characters)... 
I will do this after come back from IETF meeting in San Diego next week.. best regards, Yongge "Tom Gindin" tgindin@us.ibm.com on 12/08/2000 07:02:15 PM Subject: Re: ECDSA in XML Thank you.
