<s> Hi folks, Yongge Wang and I have taken a cut at extending the DSIG syntax to allow ECDSA.  </s>
<s> (See the I-D referenced below.) We'd like to solicit comments from anyone in the group that can find time to look ... in particular, did we do the extension correctly, etc.  </s>
<s> We're hoping that if we can get the extension mechanism correct, our work could help people who come along later and want to add support for other alogrithms ... Best regards.  </s>

<s> Pages : 7 Date : 14-Nov-00 This document specifies how to use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with the XML-digital signature syntax.  </s>
<s> The mechanism specified provides integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that includes the signature or included by reference.  </s>

<s> This draft doesn't contain any examples yet, so it's fairly hard to critique, or test against.  </s>
<s> It did take a while to do the examples for PKCS-1.  </s>
<s> This may be an ignorant comment by someone who is far from being an XML guru, but I didn't see a revised version of the Schema definition of KeyValue incorporating ECDSAKeyValue, which would naturally go in there.  </s>

<s> Hi Tom, Sorry for the delay ... I wanted to get back to the office and consult with our XML expert before responding!  </s>
<s> Thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> We're working on some examples, and are planning to post them as a separate document.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how we left out the updated schema for KeyValue ... we've added it now and are planning to wait a little while to see if any more comments come in before we post it.  </s>
<s> Thanks again.  </s>
