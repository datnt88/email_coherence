<s> If you're not on the IETF-Announce list, you might not have seen this announcement about the upcoming meeting in Yokohama.  </s>
<s> To bring our "agenda" up-to-date, here's what I think the largest and hardest issues are for RFC2518 bis: - Whether/how to change the If header rules and syntax - Whether/how to change the source property definition Although the If header has been shown to be interoperable in its simplest form with locktokens, it hasn't been shown to be interoperable in its more advanced forms or with ETags.  </s>
<s> The source property has not had any demonstrated interoperability to my knowledge.  </s>
<s> I'd like to encourage anybody with ideas on what to do with either of these two features to make concrete proposals to the list.  </s>
<s> If your proposal is  </s>
<s> "leave things the way they are", I'd like to see some discussion on how to meet the requirements for going to proposed standard (how to demonstrate interoperability, and how much interoperability is enough).  </s>
<s> Another ACL draft is expected before the Yokohama cut-off, therefore ACLs will probably also be discussed in Yokohama.  </s>
<s> I'll be asking for a meeting slot.  </s>

<s> If headers with ETags do not add any value to the protocol.  </s>
<s> For GET rfc2616 already defines If-Match and friends.  </s>
<s> Since the ETag only captures content changes (property changes have undefined effect on ETags), IF headers for ETag lack a use case.  </s>
<s> Having never encountered a client using them, I propose to drop ETags in IF headers.  </s>
<s> The remaining "more advanced" features of IF I can think of are: - not - use of URIs with locktokens URIs with locktokens are in use by us (both server and client).  </s>
<s> Does anyone have a use case for "Not"?  </s>

<s> OK; if we drop ETags in If headers how are servers intended to handle requests using the old syntax, or do you believe that is not an issue (if so, why)?  </s>

<s> We can handle this similar to the "keepalive" body for COPY requests.  </s>
<s> Do we know a client using IF headers with ETags?  </s>
<s> If it is a feature not used by anyone, it has not proven interoperability and we should change/discard it.  </s>
<s> If we discover that it is used, or if someone can explain the use case and benefits, that is a completely different matter.  </s>

<s> An etag in an If: header can be used to assert that a file has been unchanged since you last fetched it.  </s>
<s> Specifically, that you still have the locktoken *or* (you lost it and) it is unchanged.  </s>
<s> This is to cover the case where lock a file, fetch it, and then attempt to  </s>
<s> PUT the file back.  </s>
<s> The PUT should succeed if you have the locktoken *or* if you lost your lock but the etag matches what you GET'd (thus: nobody else  </s>
<s> changed it).  </s>
<s> Arguably, the semantic could be manufactured with other combinations, but I'd suggest that is your use case.  </s>

<s> mod_dav handles the current If: header specification (entirely), so no skin off my back to keep the current spec.  </s>
<s> However, it is some nasty code that I'd just as soon remove.  </s>

<s> So I change my mind and am in favour of keeping If: headers functionality as they are described in 2518.  </s>
<s> Regarding potential length of this header: would it be ok to allow whitespace between tokens, so that the header can be more easily split on several lines?  </s>

<s> My preference is not strong, but I do agree with Geoff that we should consider removing ETAG support from the IF: header unless someone steps forward for a good reason to keep it.  </s>
<s> The discussion has bounced around a bit, so I'll try to point out what hasn't been covered.  </s>
<s> As Geoff said... The functionality of ETags in IF: headers appear to already be available via other means.  </s>
<s> Stephan's question about whether any *clients* submit Etags in IF: headers hasn't been answered.  </s>
<s> Obviously if no clients use it, it's not a big issue, but please explain further.  </s>
