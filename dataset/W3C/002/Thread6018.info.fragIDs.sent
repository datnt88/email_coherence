<s> Hi, I'm a newcomer to the list and "choreography" lingo so forgive me if I have missed some important context.  </s>
<s> I've been reading through the archives and noted that you're grappling with the issues of behavioural composition in a distributed context.  </s>
<s> I spent several years of my PhD on this issue and hope that I can help.  </s>
<s> The thesis describes a choreography (or coordination) language, a formal execution semantics for the language, and a prototype for a distributed, asynchronous runtime engine implementing the semantics.  </s>
<s> The approach does not require any central mediator because execution progresses based on partial state held at each participant.  </s>
<s> I've included some references to papers at the end of this email and can supply copies of those and the thesis on request.  </s>
<s> The third paper is preceding but related work on the business/legal aspects of implementing contracts that I think might be quite relevant to choreography use cases.  </s>
<s> The thesis has overview and example chapters that are fairly approachable for those without significant interest in the more formal and technical aspects of the work.  </s>
<s> I'll try to follup up on a few threads with more specific comments.  </s>

<s> Dear Andrew, Welcome from me!  </s>
<s> I am sure others will welcome you as well.  </s>
<s> It sounds to me as if the work you have done is exactly on the topic we are trying to produce a 'standards' solution for.  </s>
<s> Personally I would be happy with the 'technical' content of what you say below as an expansion of our 'Mission Statement'.  </s>
<s> This W3C WS-Choreography group has just set up a task force to look at formalisms we could base our work on.  </s>
<s> The lead is Frank (Francis McCabe fgm@fla.fujitsu.com)  </s>
<s> and you may wish to make contact with him and that 'sub-group'.  </s>
<s> Mike Champion (Mike.Champion@SoftwareAG-USA.com) and Monica Martin (Monica.Martin@Sun.COM) are leading an 'Inputs' task force looking at some existing languages such as WSCI, BPSS and so on.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps you - looks like you will have some interesting contributions to make.  </s>
<s> Personally I appreciate your bringing in the idea of contracts.  </s>
<s> I think they are very relevant, but I was waiting until the group was a bit further along before raising.  </s>
