<s> Howdy. I've got a small issue with this option.  </s>
<s> Given the following file test.htm:  </s>
<s> hello  </s>
<s> If I execute: tidy --hide-endtags true test.htm  </s>
<s> I'll get back: hello And similarly for large files - it strips off the html and body tags.  </s>
<s> Any suggestions?  </s>

<s> You didn't cite a target HTML version, but the DTD for HTML 4.01 has, for the HTML and BODY elements: ...which indicates that both the start and end tags for those elements are optional.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I'm not clear as to what you prefer.  </s>
<s> Is your issue that the option should be renamed to reflect the omission of *all* optional tags, and not simply optional end tags, or that HTML Tidy should omit optional end tags but not optional start tags?  </s>
<s> In other words, do you recommend  </s>
<s> renaming the option and keeping the current behavior, or do you prefer that Tidy instead generate: hello for your test case?  </s>

<s> Hmm, interesting question.  </s>
<s> Perhaps for this option the end-tags shouldn't be removed if the start tags are also optional.  </s>
<s> In this case the start and end tags are jointly optional, but not separately.  </s>
<s> And then an option could permit removal of _all_ optional tags.  </s>
<s> Or, at least that would solve this particular problem.  </s>
<s> Thank you for replying.  </s>
