This is not possible with the current webdav spec. 
The source file must reside on a DAV-enabled server, or at least one that makes sense of a COPY request. 
However, Xythos' dav implementation makes this possible by supporting COPY with a Source: header. 
So you could perform your request with two transactions: COPY /temp HTTP/1.1 Host: www.W1.com 
Source: http://www.s2.com/D1/F1 COPY /temp HTTP/1.1 Host: www.W1.com Destination: http://www.s1.com/D1/F1 Again, assuming S1 supports PUT and W1 is an Xythos Dav server.

- Jim Hi, I require a clarification in the functioning of the WebDAV. 
Consider a set up like below : S1W1S2 S1 and S2 are two normal servers, while W1 is a webserver with the DAV inculcated. 
If I want to get a file F1 from W1(at directory D1 say) to S1(at directory D2) I can say : COPY /~D1/F1 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.W1.com Destination: http://www.S1/D2/F1 W1 would then transfer the file from W1 ro S1. What should happen if I want to stream the file from S2 to S1 via W1 ? 
Would the following transaction be performed by W1 ? 
COPY /~D1/F1 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.S2.com Destination: http://www.S1/D2/F1 
If no, then what should be transaction to be sent across to W1? If yes, then : Would W1 create a file and retain a copy for itself while transferring it to S1 ? 
Any sort of clarification would be most welcome. 
Thanks, Sathya

Would the following transaction be performed by W1 ? 
COPY /~D1/F1 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.S2.com Destination: http://www.S1/D2/F1 No, the transaction would be performed by www.S2.com (since that is the host you sent it to). 
W1 is never mentioned in this request, and therefore is not involved in processing it. 
If no, then what should be transaction to be sent across to W1? Some have asked for a Source: header for COPY to allow you to copy to a WebDAV server (the Destination: header only lets you COPY from a WebDAV server). 
If both a Source and Destination header were supported at the same time by a server, you could get the functionality you are asking for. 
But note that a non-WebDAV server does not have collections, so even if you tried to copy something that looked like a collection (e.g. copying /x/y, when there is a resource /x/y/foo.html), 
unless you are copying from a WebDAV server, you would just copy the content of whatever GET would return from /x/y, and not a collection (or any properties, since only WebDAV resources have properties). 
I would probably vote against such a Source header for COPY, because of these edge cases around copying a collection, but I could be swayed (:-).
