<s> Can I use tidy while leaving the indents of my page as they were?  </s>
<s> If not, then I would like to make this a feature request because I'm not always happy with the way tidy reformats a page.  </s>
<s> regards, Pim van Arend.  </s>
<s> No. The first paragraph under the subtitle "Layout style" within possible but also why it can't be an added feature.  </s>
<s> If you're desperate to preserve a laboriously contrived layout -- and I know I sometimes am -- then here is a (probably more laborious) workaround.  </s>
<s> Ignore Tidy's standard output and instead read its error/warning file (the file you specify after the "-f" switch), making your own corrections to the original file as appropriate.  </s>

<s> I should have read this more carefully.No  </s>
<s> more questions ;)  </s>
<s> thanks, Pim van Arend.  </s>
<s> Yes, I do this too.  </s>
<s> However, you have to watch out for a few things that Tidy changes without warning you about - double quote marks (") changed to , apostrophes to &amp;#39;, and lone ampersands (&amp;) to &amp;amp;.  </s>
<s> While sympathising with the original request, I think it is outside of Tidy's original remit, which is (as I understand it) to correct an HTML file so it is legal.  </s>
<s> This necessarily entails disassembling it, and the corrected result can only be re-created to some defined standard, as indentation may HAVE to be changed to make the file legal.  </s>
<s> I think Tidy should be treated as a "first pass" engine, and if you want to re-edit the output to your indentation standard, then that is up to you.  </s>
<s> Incremental code changes can then be re-checked, errors noted, and the original files corrected by hand.  </s>
<s> As Mr.Evans says, this is a rather laborious approach, but once done, incremental changes are easier.  </s>
<s> Or, of course, you could learn to love the standard output style adopted by Tidy.  </s>
<s> :-) Regards, Peter  </s>
<s> Another thing to try would be: - Before running Tidy, Find and Replace all tabs with an HTML entity that you don't already have in your code.  </s>
<s> - Run Tidy on the resulting mess with indenting turned off.  </s>
<s> - Replace all of the entities in the resulting code with tabs again.  </s>
<s> Voila!  </s>
<s> If you use BBTidy with BBEdit on the Mac, just write a little AppleScript to do this for you.  </s>
<s> Tabs are searched for using "\t".  </s>
