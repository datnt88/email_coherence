Is there available anywhere an open source example of using webdav to retrieve 
files through a browser and seemlessly work with them using a client application 
- word perfect or ms word. 
Then, be able to save these files with same type of 
interface one would experience as if saving to local disk? 
there will be ... in one week! 
worked on it for my bacc.work on university - now I have to join the code with the CVS from Group-Office (group-office.sf.net) ... so, if you 
are patient, you can see it in less than one week! 
If you can't wait, I can give you an account on the test-server for now...

I'm not sure about what you're looking for. 
If you use MS Office, you can open/modiffy/write back resources on a WebDAV server out of the box. 
If the server happens to support DeltaV and autoversioning, this will work automatically as well. 
For OpenOffice, there may be a few issues with autoversioning DeltaV servers, as (last time I checked), OpenOffice does not lock resources... Julian 
Michael, I am interested in seeing it also, as soon as it is released. 
I am not in a rush for it, so when you have it out is fine. 
Thank you.
