Hello. 
I'm trying to implement an svg viewer, but I don't understand the test: coordSystem-unitsProcessing-BE-04.svg 
especially the 3 skewed circles with radius expressed in user space units, pixels, and percentage. 
How exactly is the radius computed ? 
There is some discussion as comments in the test file, but it's still strange for me... First, the inverse matrix is computed. 
Then the length ot the diagonal of the viewport. 
Then something in relation with what could be the "translate" coordinates of the inverse matrix, then the radius. 
Could someone be kind enough to explain me what happens here ? 
I find the CR pretty vague on that subject... Thanks, st?phane.

in fact, for the last circle (the green one), the test file reads: !-- Draw marker using percentages. 
This should yield a value of 3.536 -- !-- in user space. 
10px = 2.222% of 450px -- shouldn't it be 10px of hypot(450,450) instead of the width (450) ? 
ie instead of 10/450, we should have 10/hypot(450,450) = 10/636 = 1,572% stephane conversy ecole des mines de nantes 
Stephane, The latest draft of the SVG specification changed the rules on units processing, making this test obsolete. 
The SVG working group is very close to releasing an updated version of the test suite which is consistent with the latest SVG draft specification. 
Until the new test suite is available, I recommend referring to the Nov. 2 specification rather than the current public test suite, which is was posted in June, I believe. 
You have every right to complain about how slow the SVG working group has been in updating the test suite. 
We all apologize. 
But the delays haven't been because of lack of effort. 
We have invested lots of time in developing new tests and correcting existing tests over the past months. 
The delays have to do primarily with the amount of work in ensuring that the test suite is of good quality.

Salut Stephane, There will be a new public release of the test suite very soon which is updated to the latest specs. 
In particular, units processing has changed in the latest SVG spec and the new (as yet unreleased to the public) test suite reflects this.
