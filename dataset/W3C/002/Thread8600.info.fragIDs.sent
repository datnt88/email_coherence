<s> Otherwise, the material in KeyInfo would seem to be largely untrustworthy even if our signatures validate.  </s>
<s> After validation, we would have to dig up the real information from the actual certificates just to be sure that all of this identity information wasn't substituted on us by an attacker.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, perhaps it is done this way to force application developers to obtain the information (like subject name) from the certificate to avoid attacks from those who would generate a faulty signature.  </s>
<s> In which case, why bother breaking this information out into XML?  </s>

<s> True that once it is fully explained, it seems obvious.  </s>

<s> Our approach is different, and I think rightly so, because we are dealing with a new paradigm with how applications integrate security.  </s>
<s> On the XML Encryption list, there has been quite a discussion recently about securing names so I'm glad the question came up again.  </s>
