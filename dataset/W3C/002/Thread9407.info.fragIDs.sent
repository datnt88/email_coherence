[i'm trying to do something] 
As promised in the last telecon of 2001-09-14 [14:20:20] spetschu-scribe em: does DanBri need help from the group? 
What can we do to help? 
[14:20:28] spetschu-scribe DanBri: test folks can help out [14:21:02] spetschu-scribe JosD: I could help look at the NTriples cases ]] -- http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2001-09-14.html 
I started with that at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range but W3C team should give appropriate access rights. 
In the mean time it can be found at Issue rdfs-domain-and-range: Should a property be allowed more than one rdfs:range property? 
What should the semantics of multiple domain and range properties be? - Multiple domain and range constraints are permissable and will have conjunctive semantics. 
test001 describes a property with rdfs:domain the intersection of 2 domains test002 describes a property with rdfs:range the intersection of 2 ranges test003 sample statement test004 entailed description using test001, test002, test003 and axioms axioms a couple of N3 rules to infer rdf:type information I hope the rdf-to-nt is quite straightforward. 
The entailment stuff is there to support the issue resolution. 
We've been testing that with CWM and Euler. 
For Euler we have java Euler test001.nt 
test002.nt 
test003.nt 
axioms.n3 
test004.nt which is like test001 test002 test003 axioms.n3 
|= test004 and it gives the appropriate evidence for the entailment. 
For CWM we have python /n3/cwm.py 
test001.nt 
test002.nt 
test003.nt 
axioms.n3 
--think and we see that that includes the statements in test004 Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
Excellent Jos! 
The dir and all of the files are now readable at: 
Art, Jos, Thanks Jos. 
I guess this sort of test case does not fit the "here's the RDF/XML, this is what it means in n-triples" pattern very well, which seems to suggest 
we need a new pattern for defining schema test cases. 
Did you guys have something in mind?

Brian: 
In testing ARP I work through a zip file finding all pairs of RDF and NT and check they are the same. 
I noticed that this test case still supports that. 
I think it is important that someone wishing to run automated tests off the test cases should be able to, without having to code in lots of specific filenames. 
I note that the zip file version is more useful than the web version for automated testing, since it is fairly hard to automatically work through all the files in a web directory.

Brian, Art, 
You've seen that very good Brian! 
There is indeed little value in the individual cases but I still believe very hard in the "this is what it means in n-triples" when one applies the "entailment pattern" *across* the cases, and I mean also cases at other places. 
I think it is the beauty of something like uri1 uri2 uri3 |= uri4 that it can explain further meaning. 
I also think that it is perfectly automatable (at least we do it right now) but we indeed need some conventions for that.

You old charmer you .. :) 
So Jos, would you be willing to draft something for inclusion in the test cases WD which explains how these tests work. 
The syntax test cases area easy. 
The directory name tells me what is being tested. 
The RDF/XML files define the input and the equivalent .nt 
files define the correct output. 
If my implementation produces equivalent output to the .nt 
file, then it processing that test case correctly. 
Its probably best to assume that a significant part of our audience may be new to FOL. 
Brian 
give me some time, and I'll give it some try... 
That's true, but there are some nice pieces like Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/
