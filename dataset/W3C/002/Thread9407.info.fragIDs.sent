<s> What can we do to help?  </s>

<s> I started with that at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range but W3C team should give appropriate access rights.  </s>
<s> In the mean time it can be found at Issue rdfs-domain-and-range: Should a property be allowed more than one rdfs:range property?  </s>
<s> What should the semantics of multiple domain and range properties be? - Multiple domain and range constraints are permissable and will have conjunctive semantics.  </s>
<s> test001 describes a property with rdfs:domain the intersection of 2 domains test002 describes a property with rdfs:range the intersection of 2 ranges test003 sample statement test004 entailed description using test001, test002, test003 and axioms axioms a couple of N3 rules to infer rdf:type information I hope the rdf-to-nt is quite straightforward.  </s>
<s> The entailment stuff is there to support the issue resolution.  </s>

<s> Art, Jos, Thanks Jos.  </s>
<s> I guess this sort of test case does not fit the "here's the RDF/XML, this is what it means in n-triples" pattern very well, which seems to suggest  </s>

<s> Brian:  </s>
<s> In testing ARP I work through a zip file finding all pairs of RDF and NT and check they are the same.  </s>
<s> I noticed that this test case still supports that.  </s>
<s> I think it is important that someone wishing to run automated tests off the test cases should be able to, without having to code in lots of specific filenames.  </s>
<s> I note that the zip file version is more useful than the web version for automated testing, since it is fairly hard to automatically work through all the files in a web directory.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Brian, Art,  </s>
<s> You've seen that very good Brian!  </s>
<s> There is indeed little value in the individual cases but I still believe very hard in the "this is what it means in n-triples" when one applies the "entailment pattern" *across* the cases, and I mean also cases at other places.  </s>
<s> I think it is the beauty of something like uri1 uri2 uri3 |= uri4 that it can explain further meaning.  </s>
<s> I also think that it is perfectly automatable (at least we do it right now) but we indeed need some conventions for that.  </s>

<s> You old charmer you .. :)  </s>
<s> So Jos, would you be willing to draft something for inclusion in the test cases WD which explains how these tests work.  </s>
<s> The syntax test cases area easy.  </s>
<s> The directory name tells me what is being tested.  </s>
<s> The RDF/XML files define the input and the equivalent .nt  </s>
<s> files define the correct output.  </s>
<s> If my implementation produces equivalent output to the .nt  </s>
<s> file, then it processing that test case correctly.  </s>
<s> Its probably best to assume that a significant part of our audience may be new to FOL.  </s>

<s> That's true, but there are some nice pieces like Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
