Geoff and I have volunteered to author a standalone WebDAV Locking specification 
Thanks, please do it. 
Unless people can think of new arguments, I'd propose that the WG simply votes on the issue. 
To restate our proposal: 1) We will *not* add locking discussion to BIND (in fact, we may want to remove some locking-specific preconditions). 
2) We'll extract all parts relevant to Locking from RFC2518, integrate GULP and resolve all locking related issues from the RF2518 issues list, and publish this as a separate LOCKING document (starting as Proposed standard updating RFC2518). 
3) As a consequence, the authors of RFC2518bis should remove the locking part of the specification (once both RFC2518bis becomes a Draft standard and LOCKING is a Proposed standard, it will be relatively simple to advance LOCKING as well). 
4) draft-ietf-webdav-bind-05 as published can be wg-last-called after possibly referencing the LOCKING spec. 
+ 1 Cheers, Edgar

Thank Heaven. 
As an observer, this was going in a terrible direction. 
In fact, it seems that DAV gets increasingly complex all the time, without apparent convergence. 
Furthermore, the server-side implementations outside Apache appear to be withering away. 
As such it seems less like a W3C standard and more like a private protocol for special purposes, owned by the Apache working group and a few client vendors who implemented it. 
Is WebDAV really a standard? 
I think not.

I take that as agreement that locking should be moved into a separate document, instead of having advanced protocols (such as BIND) having to extend/fix RFC2518's definition of locks? 
Well, it's a proposed standard, and many many clients and servers are using it. 
It's somehow "beyond hype", but that's not necessarily bad. 
Our customers definitively use WebDAV intensively, be it for editing using Microsoft Office, for mass import/export, or as transport protocol for interconnecting separate servers. 
Thanks for the feedback, Julian
