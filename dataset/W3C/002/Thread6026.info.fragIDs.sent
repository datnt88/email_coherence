<s> I certainly don't think that is it sufficient to model only bilateral  </s>
<s> transactions.  </s>
<s> Many business transactions have multiple actors, and we want  </s>
<s> to build standards that will work for common service transaction models.  </s>
<s> 3. There also seemed to be agreement that dynamic participation is a required feature (i.e., not all participants in a choreography may be known in advance).  </s>
<s> This is a must-have - limiting ourselves to predetermined transaction sequences will not work; this is inconsistent with the WS architecture model and with the needs of the users of WS technology.  </s>
<s> 4. There is an expressed preference not to require a dependency on WSDL (although as Martin noted there is a requirement in the charter that WSDL 1.2 be supported).  </s>
<s> (Maybe abstract WSDL is ok?) Dependency and support are two different animals - we can support WSDL, without requiring it.  </s>
<s> This is probably the best approach, IMHO. 5. Declarative vs. executable model.  </s>

<s> --Jon  </s>
<s> I was originally thinking that a multi-party choreography can always be  </s>
<s> broken down into multiple "inter-dependent" bi-party choreography.  </s>
<s> But I  </s>
<s> am convinced that this is NOT always possible.  </s>
<s> See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-chor/2003Mar/0052.html  </s>
<s> So I think bi-party choreography is a special case of multi-party choreography.  </s>
<s> Bi-party choreography has some interesting properties that  </s>
<s> can simplify the modeling.  </s>
<s> (e.g. Bi-Party choreography doesn't need to  </s>
<s> worry about dynamic participation because any change of a binding can simply terminate the choreography).  </s>
<s> I think we should covered multi-party choreography.  </s>
<s> In additional, we may  </s>
<s> also need to investigate this special subset called bi-party choreography.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Ricky  </s>
<s> Ricky: It is also interesting to introduce the perspective of why a multi-party can be used for?  </s>
<s> Both a multi-party and binary can be used to represent what is going to happen (see Assaf's presentation on causality).  </s>
<s> A binary collaboration can easily be used as part of an agreement, as well as to configure run-time engine that "monitor" the choreography (firewall concept).  </s>
<s> In the case of a multi-party, we might want to ask whether the goal is simply to represent what is going to happen such that each party can infer what they need to do.  </s>
<s> Hence decompose the multi-party into bilateral behavior (which will itself be decomposed in unilateral behavior).  </s>
<s> Is there a need to establish multi-party agreements based on a multi-party choreography definition?  </s>
<s> At the run-time engine level, things gets far more complicated because unless there is a party that touches all the "bilateral choreographies", it is impossible without special run-time to "monitor" the multi-party choreography.  </s>
<s> So the question arise, is the goal of a multi-party choreography specification to allow configuration of run-time engines?  </s>
<s> In think in the light of this, we should not conclude that binary is a special case of multi-party.  </s>
<s> They may well have both distinct features (control flow?) and applications.  </s>
<s> I am also wondering if the group wants to keep as a requirement that says that in the choreography specification there is no distinction between the choreography involving "internal" services as opposed to external services.  </s>
<s> A separate layer of the specification should allow for annotating that this particular message exchange is external and may have more qualifiers.  </s>
<s> However, at the pure choreography specification level, the choreographies should not be distinguished.  </s>

<s> JJ, comments inline  </s>
<s> I think the "monitor" doesn't restricted to binary collaboration.  </s>
<s> It applies to multi-party as well.  </s>
<s> Decomposing multi-party into bi-party may lost some information about dependencies (see the doctor/patient use case) and is not always possible.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand "unilateral behavior", sounds like it is a private implementation.  </s>
<s> I guess a multi-party choreography is only useful when all defined roles agree to conform to.  </s>
<s> So this is a multi-party agreement.  </s>
<s> I think it is possible to monitoring all traffic pattern of a single party conforms to a multi-party choreography.  </s>
<s> (you still need to have multi-party definition to do that).  </s>
<s> If every party agrees to put a monitor, then you certainly can get the whole picture.  </s>
<s> But even monitor one party can provide high value.  </s>
<s> Does multi-party covers the case when N = 2 ?  </s>
<s> Is so, then bi-party is a special case of multi-party.  </s>
<s> But I agree that bi-party may have some extra properties (such as a simpler role binding model) that we should take a serious look at.  </s>
<s> If choreography is only meaningful to specify a contract between multiple "domain of control", then it should only focus in the message exchange across the boundary, which means external services ?  </s>
<s> Right ?  </s>
