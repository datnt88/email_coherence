Primarily intended for DaveB, Art, Jan. 
I attach the beginnings of a declarative approach to triple generation, and I am interested in what anybody thinks. 
It is based on top of the Lexical-Functional Grammar formalism (used by computational linguists). 
I hence work from the EBNF form of the grammar rather than the Infoset form. 
I am really interested in responses like, "hmm interesting but here's a better way :-)" Jeremy 
Nice work! 
But... Here are the intended symbols, I hope they come out right on your browser. 
Regrettably they don't come out right in my browser :-) 
I think it is almost impossible to get 'math' symbols to come out right in more than about half the extant browsers. 
It might be better to use &amp;-escapes with the character names. 
I notice that the Encyclopedia of Philosophy uses little gifs for things like quantifiers and subset in its HTML, presumably in desperation.

Interesting approach, but I haven't yet fully grasped what's going on. 
I (too) have problems with the math symbols -- is there any chance of posting a PDF or postscript? 
Also, I think there may be some overlap with some ideas that Sandro Hawke has been looking at, which he calls "Blindfold Grammars" #g

Combining these two approaches in MINSE: which takes plain text math such as: 'deriv(f(x), x) = 'lim((f(x+h)-f(x))/h, h- 0) and converts them to ASCII art: d f(x + h) - f(x) ---- f(x) = lim ----------------- dx h - 0 h or images: ml(h_@(rtarrow)_0))_@bar(f@paren(x_+_h)_-_f@paren(x),h)_ [ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/

I attach two PDF files, the A3 version has the desired 2D layout, the A4 version is presumably more printable. 
In a chat before the teleconference with Dave Beckett he argued, fairly convincingly: + we shouldn't impose another formalism on our target developer community. 
It may be more realistic to assume XSLT for example. 
+ he also found my working from the EBNF rules as somewhat disingeneous. 
If we are saying that they are syntactically flawed (which is the motivation for an infoset approach), it then seems strange to motivate our triple production on top of them. 
(I hope I haven't misrepresented DaveB). 
I am trying to argue in favour of a formal declarative spec for triple production; without going to extremes (e.g. xml:lang can be added using English text) Jeremy
