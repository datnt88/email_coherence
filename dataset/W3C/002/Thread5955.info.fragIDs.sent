Any suggestions? 
I have until 8:00pm my time (UK) to firm this up and get it out.

I have the glossary with questions for the group to address and will distribute this afternoon (MT). 
Thanks. 
As indicated, attached is the working glossary with the comments I received from Assaf and Hugo. 
I also heard from Mike Brumbelow, who wishes to assist on glossary. 
Mike, please do a pass over this for tomorrow and once the discussion gets going, we'll do so as well. 
Those items in red in the document are changes made from comments received. 
Comments / questions are also inserted in these sections, for team discussion at the appropriate time. 
As well, as requested last week, I've added additional detail to my two cases for consideration with some potential areas to mine for requirements. 
These scenarios were based on real world requirements in European and high technology/electronic component industries. 
Thanks.
