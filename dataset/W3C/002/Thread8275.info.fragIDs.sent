<s> Hi.  </s>
<s> As RFC3253 already talks about bindings, shouldn't the BIND spec be labelled as "updating RFC3253"?  </s>
<s> The benefit being that a reader of RFC3253 using the RFC Index could actually find out that there's an additional document that may help understanding RFC3253.  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> I agree that some reference to RFC3253 would be useful (e.g. something like "this provides a detailed description of the binding model that is implicit in RFC3253"), but I wouldn't say that it "updates" RFC3253, since it doesn't change anything in RFC3253.  </s>

<s> Well, "updates" is the only type of link we *can* use (nothing else would create a forward reference in the RFC Index).  </s>
<s> Besides, I'd say that it in fact "updates" RFC3253, because it updates RFC2518's descriptions for MOVE, COPY, DELETE etc in presence of  </s>
<s> multiple bindings.  </s>
<s> Thus, it indeed updates both RFC2518 and RFC3253.  </s>
<s> Regards, Julian  </s>
<s> In general, I don't see much of a problem with indicating that a spec like this "updates" a previous document even if the document doesn't change specific items in the previous document.  </s>
<s> Speaking personally, when I see "updates", I take it as "read both".  </s>
<s> The contrast is, obviously, with "supersedes" which implies one can/should read only the second document.  </s>
<s> Just my take on it, regards, Ted Hardie  </s>
<s> And "read both" is what I'd really like to express.  </s>
<s> Geoff?  </s>
<s> However, looking at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-07.txt , section 2.11:  </s>
<s> Updates Specifies an earlier document whose contents are modified or  </s>
<s> augmented by the new document.  </s>
<s> The new document cannot be used alone, it can only be used in conjunction with the earlier document.  </s>
<s> So maybe we need to leave it as is...  </s>
<s> Regards, Julian  </s>
<s> Why doesn't "augmented" cover this case?  </s>
<s> My reading of the text above is  </s>
<s> that "it can only be used in conjunction with the earlier document" _for_the_  </s>
<s> areas_of_overlap.  </s>
<s> That is, you can update RFC XXXX and still have material that is stand alone that is not overlapping with RFC XXXX.  </s>
<s> Ted  </s>
<s> Well, that would make sense, but in that case maybe draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis should be clarified... Regards, Julian  </s>
<s> In the context of that statement in RFC2223bis, I think we're best off just saying that the BIND document updates 2518, and not 3253.  </s>
<s> It just isn't the case that the BIND document "can only be used in conjunction with" 3253, while this is the  </s>
<s> case for 2518.  </s>
<s> In addition, there really is no pressing need to get a connection between BIND and 3253.  </s>

<s> I think RFC2223bis is plain wrong here and needs to be fixed.  </s>
<s> For instance, RFC2396 (URI) "updates" previous URL specs that in fact not only contained URL syntax, but also specific schemes such as "ftp".  </s>
<s> However, RFC2396 clearly can be used without the documents it's updating.  </s>
<s> Hm. As RFC3253 speaks of bindings, and also introduces operations that create additional bindings to the same resource, I'd think that it makes a lot of sense to have that link... Regards, Julian  </s>
<s> I raised the issue on the ietf-discuss mailing list ( http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/ietf/Current/msg23697.html ) and consensus seems to be that "updates" can be used even if the new document does not *require* the previous document (such as in RFC2396 updating the URI syntax without repeating definitions of specific URI schemes such as "ftp").  </s>
