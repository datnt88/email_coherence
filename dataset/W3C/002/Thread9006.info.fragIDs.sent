I missed the earlier announce I suppose, but I'm cc:ing this call to the xmldsig and xenc lists. 
Both of those specs are dependent on XML1.0 and I haven't considered the 1.1 spec closely enough to understand if xmldsig and xenc could also work with 1.1 . 
I hope to think about it more carefully and that others in the WG will do the same!

Chairs, especially those of the following WGs: I18N DOM XSL XML Protocol XML Query XML Schema XML Signature The XML 1.1 Last Call period ends in a little over a week. 
Please let us know if you will be sending in a review by June 28th. 
thanks, Paul Grosso, Arnaud Le Hors Co-chairs, XML Core WG 
This is the last call announcement for XML 1.1 aka http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/ Abstract This document describes XML 1.1, a deliverable of the XML Core Working Group as defined in the XML Blueberry Requirements. 
XML 1.1 was formerly known as XML Blueberry. 
This document takes the form of a series of alterations to the XML 1.0 Recommendation [XML1.0], and its numbered sections correspond to those of the XML 1.0 Recommendation. 
Sections of that Recommendation that do not appear in this document remain unchanged in XML 1.1. 
Status of this Document This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. 
Other documents may supersede this document. 
The latest status of this document series is maintained at the W3C. 
This is a Last Call Working Draft of the XML Core Working Group (member only), for review by W3C members and other interested parties. 
This document has been produced as part of the XML Activity, and may eventually be advanced toward W3C Recommendation status. 
Being a Working Draft document, this specification may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. 
The test cases described and referred to in this document may also be updated, replaced or obsoleted at an any time. 
It is therefore inappropriate to use W3C Working Drafts as reference material or to cite them as other than "work in progress". 
A list of current W3C working drafts can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/ . 
This draft document will be considered by the W3C and its members according to W3C process. 
This document is made public for the purpose of receiving comments that inform the W3C membership and staff on issues likely to affect the implementation, acceptance, and adoption of XML 1.1. 
While this and subsequent drafts of this specification will be written as a series of alterations to the XML 1.0 Recommendation to facilitate editing and review, it is likely that the final XML 1.1 Recommendation will take the form of an integral revision of the XML 1.0 specification. 
We explicitly invite comments on this draft. 
The Last Call review period ends at 2359Z on 28 June 2002. 
Comments should be sent to www-xml-blueberry-comments@w3.org . 
This is the preferred method of providing feedback. 
Public comments and their responses can be accessed at Other notices The XML Core WG makes a special feedback request on the issue of Normalization checking in XML 1.1. 
Among other things, the decision to mandate that XML 1.1 processors do normalization checking means that some potential (though probably rare in practice) well-formed XML 1.0 documents would not be XML 1.1 documents. 
The XML Core WG also notes a minority opinion at supporting the addition of 0x1-0x1F to the allowed range of characters in XML documents and accordingly makes a special feedback request on this issue. 
The following are the working groups that are especially invited to review the draft: I18N DOM XSL XML Protocol XML Query XML Schema XML Signature The decision to go to last call is minuted at: Paul Grosso, Arnaud Le Hors Co-chairs, XML Core WG

This is the last call announcement for XML 1.1 
More specific comments upon reading it more closely: [[The first character of a Name must be a NameStartChar, but any other characters are NameChars; this mechanism is used to prevent names from beginning with Latin (ASCII) digits or with basic combining characters.]] 
I never understood this discrimination against numbers and wonder if there was much demand to finally permit them and it was decided against? 
(Or where did this constraint come from in the first place?) 
[[In order to be well-formed, all XML parsed entities (including document entities ) must be fully normalized as per the definition of [Charmod] supplemented by the following definitions of relevant constructs for XML:]] Note that "[Charmod]" links to [[ [3] S ::= (#x9 | #x20 | #xA | #xD | #x85 | #x2028)+]] [[Change "1.0" everywhere to "1.1"]] 
FYI: Canonical XML does not emit a version in the presumption that a version-less instance is 1.0 . 
I see nothing here that conflicts with that 
understanding. 
Additionally, xmldsig and xenc are firmly rooted in XML 1.0, so any subsequent comments apply to whether new versions of those specifications would have any particular problems with XML1.1 as specified. 
[[2.13 Normalization Checking [NEW] ] No problem here, most all xmldsig and xenc processing recommends the input to be in normalized form. 
"the XML processor used to prepare the XPath data model input is required (by the Data Model) to use Normalization Form C [NFC, NFC-Corrigendum] when converting an XML document to the UCS character domain from any encoding that is not UCS-based (currently, UCS-based encodings include UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE, UCS-2, and UCS-4)." [c14n] [[2.3 Common Syntactic Constructs]] With respect to line-end and white-space characters, no forms of c14n would likely to want to canonicalize these as well. 
(For example, the Attribute node serialization [2]). 
[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n Attribute Nodes- a space, the node's QName, an equals sign, an open quotation mark (double quote), the modified string value, and a close quotation mark (double quote). 
The string value of the node is modified by replacing all ampersands (&amp;) with &amp;amp;, all open angle brackets ( ) with , all quotation mark characters with , and the whitespace characters #x9, #xA, and #xD, with character references. 
The character references are written in uppercase hexadecimal with no leading zeroes (for example, #xD is represented by the character reference &amp;#xD;). 
This is an unofficial response. 
Joseph Reagle scripsit: 
It comes from SGML, but in general most computer languages don't allow identifiers that begin with digits, so they don't get confused with numbers. 
Just so.
