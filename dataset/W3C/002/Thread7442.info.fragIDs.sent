<s> Can we drop this from the spec (8.8.2)?  </s>
<s> It's also bogus to specify copying a live property "octet for octet", since there is no canonical serialized form of a WebDAV property.  </s>

<s> While I deeply respect your intuition and judgement, I would rather see someone propose an actual scenario that breaks.  </s>
<s> Since we know the current definition is no good, how could we be worse off?  </s>
<s> Bear in mind, this problem could only arise when a resource is copied to a location where some property are not live.  </s>
<s> This has never happened yet, because no WebDAV server in existance supports copying to a different server.  </s>
<s> So there can't be a compatibility issue with an existing implementation.  </s>
<s> How can you throw away all live properties without breaking locking?  </s>
<s> Mmm, but those scenarios can probably be addressed by having the client copy the properties by hand: a sequence of COPY, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH will provide the same behavior as the current spec.  </s>
