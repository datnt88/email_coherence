The elements owner, prop, and resourcetype are declared ANY. 
The XML spec section 3.2 says that ANY means "any declared element type", but as I understand this, this would exclude character data from appearing in the element. 
I think at least the first two should be declared to be Mixed instead. 
Any XML experts care to comment? 
ANY allows anything, character data or any element.

What then is difference between ANY and Mixed? 
ANY does include #PCDATA (what is termed character data in the XML spec). 
The difference between ANY and mixed content is that ANY allows any element that is declared in the DTD to turn up as content (along with the character data), while with mixed content you still have to specify which elements are allowed as content (along with the character data). 
Thus this is only really an issue if you want to validate the document, or use the DTD as a guide to which elements are allowed where; if you never want to validate and any element is always allowed anywhere then mixed content and ANY are essentially equivalent. 
I agree that the XML spec could be a little clearer on this.
