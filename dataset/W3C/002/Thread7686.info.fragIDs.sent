<s> Well, "timeout type" is used slightly inconsistently within the spec.  </s>

<s> So this is one meaning for "timeout type" -- the TimeType within the Timeout request header.  </s>
<s> It is this sense of "timeout type" that is used in section 13.8.  </s>
<s> During the creation of the spec., we had discussions about whether to support different kinds of lock refresh policies, and potentially having the  </s>
<s> ability to say whether the timeout was absolute, or could be refreshed by actions on the resource.  </s>
<s> In the end, the spec.  </s>
<s> states that locks should be  </s>
<s> refreshed by actions on the resource by the lock owner, but this hasn't been  </s>
<s> widely implemented (to the best of my knowledge), since it adds a fair performance penalty to all operations.  </s>
<s> There is currently an item on the DAV issues list "LOCK_REFRESH_BY_METHODS" that suggests the current SHOULD-level requirement for refreshing the lock timer based on actions by the lock owner should be removed.  </s>
<s> However, it is this notion of locks being  </s>
<s> refreshed by user activity that results in the mention of "activity-based timeout policy" in 8.10.8.  </s>

<s> you referenced.  </s>
<s> As near as I can tell, there are many similarities between the semantics for Jini leases and WebDAV locks.  </s>
<s> Jini leases allow an object to request a lease that lasts forever, or for a specific time period, similar to WebDAV locks which can be requested for a specific time period in seconds, or with the value "Infinite".  </s>
<s> Jini leases  </s>
<s> can be refreshed, as can WebDAV locks, by re-requesting the lock.  </s>
<s> Jini leases can be canceled before the time period ends, as can WebDAV locks, using the UNLOCK method.  </s>
<s> Was there some specific Jini lease semantic that you particularly think WebDAV would benefit from?  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> leases  </s>
<s> Yes. a) You can request an "infinite" lease, but you must be prepared for the server to return to you instead a finite lease.  </s>
<s> You must then renew that lease before it expires if you want it to persist without interruption.  </s>
<s> b) The renewal of the lease is an explicit action on the part of the client, and is required to occur within a specific time interval.  </s>
<s> There is no implicit anything.  </s>
<s> This is, IMHO, significantly less complicated to implement robustly and correctly than implicit renewal.  </s>
<s> And of course, truly infinite locks are highly suspect in a distributed environment.  </s>
<s> It could be argued that leases shouldn't permit them at all -- but it suffices to interpret "infinite" to mean "the longest period a server chooses to tolerate possibly holding a resource for a client that's never coming back." -- Kaelin Become a Venture Technologist... http://www.everest.com/careers/  </s>
