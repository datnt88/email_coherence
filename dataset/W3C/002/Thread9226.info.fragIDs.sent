My mistake - got the date wrong in the title. 
Brian 
All, 
Disapointed to say this, but having failed to make sufficient progress with this issue in the past few days I would like to relinquish some of the 15-mins of agenda time allocated for today's discussion. 
I am also (due attendance at an offsite meeting) going to be joining by mobile phone, likely without IRC/Web access, so don't feel in a position to lead effective discussion of the containers-model issue at this point. 
Brian, could you (again my apologies for the timing) reorder the agenda accordingly? 
As a stopgap, I'll report my current thinking/progress by email here. 
I am now of the opinion that some relatively minor rewording of the formal model portion of the specification, plus ammendments/additions to Dave and Brian's 'Container syntax' proposal will allow us to deal with the 'representing partially described containers' of the container issue. 
Brief version: "use rdf:li for complete description of containers; use rdf:_n for partial descriptions; amend spec to make this distinction clear". 
I hope to have a complete and coherent proposal to the list in time for discussion at the next meeting. 
Dan (who is coming to terms with his first hard disk failure in 5 years, and giving thanks for CVS...)
