<s> This outlines a suggested plan for organizing the reification discussion at our 2002-02-08 telecon, together with some basic input.  </s>
<s> Fortunately,  </s>
<s> I could steal all of this from recent email (the question is whether I've stolen the right stuff!).  </s>
<s> My overall intention is to see if everyone (a) agrees on what the decision to be made is and, if so (b) is prepared to decide on which option we ought to take.  </s>
<s> A possible (c) should be some discussion of what to do about the option we *didn't* take (e.g., what do we tell the community about it, or how do we modify the published documents), but that needs to await (b).  </s>
<s> --Frank Overview: In http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0064.html  </s>
<s> Brian summarized the issue, saying:  </s>
<s> The formal section of M&amp;S defines rdf:Statement to apply to the  </s>
<s> triple  as Dan pointed out.  </s>
<s> However, the examples of reification suggest its  use for provenance, for which stating is more useful.  </s>
<s> I suggest that we don't make a big mountain out of this.  </s>
<s> There are two concepts, (subject, predicate, object) and stating.  </s>
<s> We have one URI, rdf:Statement.  </s>
<s> We pick one concept for rdf:Statement to apply to, and the other will be defined in some other vocabulary(s).  </s>
<s> Does it really matter a whole lot which is which?  </s>
<s> Process: In http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0207.html  </s>
<s> Jeremy (basically agreeing with Brian on what the issue was) suggested the following process, which makes sense to me:  </s>
<s> We now have some idea of the entailments we are discussing.  </s>
<s> I think it is important that we do not vote on these inidividually, and potentially end up with a self-contradictory set of statements (logic is not democratic).  </s>
<s> I think we should instead try to group sets of answer to the entailments in two (or maybe three) consistent positions and then have a straight vote to decide between them.  </s>
<s> e.g.  </s>
<s> A Stating reading, for the use-case of provenance, having the following entailments hold: and having the following entailments not hold: OR A Statement reading, for maximum consistency with para 162 and 163 of M&amp;S, having the following entailments hold: and having the following entailments not hold: OR In summary, I think we should have a statings versus statements show-down, using the entailments to help clarify what each position means.  </s>
<s> Jeremy also noted in an earlier message that if it turns out that provenance and quoting [insert definition here] are NOT supported by what we decide reification is, then we need to document some recommended solutions for those who want to do those things [I agree; this is a (c) issue].  </s>
<s> Test cases/entailments: I've gleaned the following from the message traffic [add any others you like].  </s>
<s> Case 1 is the one most of the discussion has been about.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that a "statement" reading of Case 1 says "yes" to this entailment, and that a "stating" [inscription?]  </s>
<s> reading says "no". 1. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0018.html  </s>

<s> stmt2 rdf:predicate predicate .  </s>

<s> stmt1 property foo .  </s>
<s> entail: stmt2 property foo .  </s>
<s> 2. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0202.html (Brian) if we decide that: s1 rdf:type rdf:Statment .  </s>

<s> s2 rdf:predicate predicate .  </s>
<s> s2 rdf:object object .  </s>
<s> s1 prop value .  </s>
<s> entails s2 prop value .  </s>
<s> then to be consistent we must also decide that anything (and nothing) entails: _:s rdf:type rdf:Statment .  </s>
<s> _:s rdf:subject subject .  </s>
<s> _:s rdf:predicate predicate .  </s>
<s> _:s rdf:object object .  </s>

<s> I don't see the consistency issue here assuming Tarski's A deductive theory is called CONSISTENT or NON-CONTRADICTORY if no two asserted statements of this theory contradict each other, or, in other words, if any two contradictory sentences at least one *cannot* be proved.  </s>
<s> where is the inconsistency Brian???  </s>
<s> It's actually "good luck" that we *cannot* prove everything!!!  </s>
<s> Jos  </s>
<s> ps I agree with 3  </s>
<s> This is intuition; I'm woefully ignorant on all this logic stuff.  </s>
<s> 3 seems to imply that you need the existence of a statement in a graph to entail the reified statement, which is what I'd expect if the reified statement represented an *occurrence* of a statement, i.e. a stating.  </s>
<s> If one regards statements as the sort of abstract things that the formal part of M&amp;S suggests to me (pps, danc and others), then to borrow a phrase from Pat, they all exist in "platonic heaven" - no occurrence is required to entail them.  </s>
<s> So I find the combination of: o a reified statement models a statement o you need an occurence of a statement to entail its reification tingles my antenae.  </s>
<s> I will now curl up into a feotal ball and await a kicking from the logicians.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Jos--  </s>
<s> My understanding was that this was teasing out whether statements were in "Platonic space" ("of course there's a statement that says that....somewhere") vs. in some more restricted (and interesting) domain.  </s>
