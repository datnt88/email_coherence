<s> Having consulted with my colleagues I will *not* be proposing to drop reification.  </s>
<s> However, in the feedback I got the following suggestion was made:  </s>
<s> There are two use cases which, if not supported by reification, you need to at least document recommended solutions - provenance and quoting.  </s>
<s> One approach might be to not remove reification but to relegate it to an advisory section.  </s>
<s> In particular, leave in the rdf:Statement, rdf:subject etc tags as reserved tags.  </s>
<s> Have two "how to's" which describe how one might represent provenance or quoting in RDF and say that you have reserved the tags "rdf:Statement" etc for this purpose but they have no special semantic status other than being the recommended type tags to use if you are trying to encode ground facts which happen to be about RDF statements.  </s>
<s> This approach allows us to: - avoid the "RDF is (NOT) its own metatheory" hole.  </s>
<s> - avoid the stating versus statement problem (depends on usage).  </s>
<s> - keep the good bits of reification (have standard vocab.  </s>
<s> for modelling RDF).  </s>
<s> It is characterised by there being no model theory for reification.  </s>
<s> I am well aware that Pat may yet produce a reification rabbit out of his hat, but currently this sort of approach is my favourite.  </s>
<s> We could even throw out all the syntax for reification and still follow this suggestion; it is more within charter not to do so, and I will not be proposing such a step.  </s>

<s> I'm sympathetic, but some comments / nits.  </s>
<s> re 'reserved the tags "rdf:Statement" etc', they're not tags, they're RDF classes and properties.  </s>
<s> One class (rdf:Statement) and three properties (rdf:p/s/o).  </s>
<s> Like other classes and properties, they have various representations as XML elements/tags.  </s>
<s> saying they're to be used 'for this purpose' (provenance and quoting) doesn't adequately describe the meaning of these constructs.  </s>
<s> What *is* an instance of rdf:Statement?  </s>
<s> We need to give a clear answer, rather than allude to possible uses for the class.  </s>
<s> That's the mistake the old spec fell into (cont.  </s>
<s> below).  </s>
<s> How so?  </s>
<s> Giving a clear definition for rdf:Statement, rdf:predicate, rdf:object and rdf:subject might avoid the stating/statement problem.  </s>
<s> If  </s>
<s> we fail to define rdf:Statement clearly, we'll continue to have stating/statement problems.  </s>
<s> I can't see how merely saying " rdf:statement and p/s/o are 'reserved for quoting, provenance etc." fixes this problem.  </s>
<s> One way to be clear when defining classes is to give identity conditions for members of the class, eg. specify whether members of rdf:Statement are uniquely picked out by their predicate/subject/object properties.  </s>
<s> I suspect that if we explore that route, we'll find the statement/stating confusion unwravels into the need to be more careful distinguishing URIs from the resources they name.  </s>
<s> Yep.  </s>
<s> Somewhere we need to write down a clear account of rdf:Statement; if it looks mathematical, the Model Theory spec seems a reasonable home for it.  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> I think I was advocating a substantially more woolly position than you appear to want.  </s>
<s> A few inline comments follow ...  </s>
<s> Words typically have more than one (related) meaning falling into different usage patterns.  </s>
<s> It works in natural language, I have yet to be convinced that giving (not particularly formal) definitions that follow the  </s>
<s> "provenace" model and the "quoting" model is not a solution.  </s>
<s> e.g. when discussing the provenance of an RDF statement: 1: A different resource is used for each occurrence of the statment.  </s>
<s> 2: The resource is of type rdf:Statement 3: The s/p/o properties are as follows: [ omitted ] 4: dc properties are used to describe provenance.  </s>
<s> [I am not suggesting (4) is correct, merely an example] This sort of resource is referred to as a "stating" when quoting Each rdf:Statement resource is uniquely identified by its s/p/o.  </s>
<s> This sort of resource is referred to as the Statement.  </s>
<s> We observe that each stating as a natural Statement corresponding to it.  </s>
<s> While it may seem confusing to have both Statements and Statings represented in the same way, in practice context will disambiguate.  </s>
<s> It is clear to merely say that the rdf:Statement corresponds to the triple in n-triple and the rdf:subject is the first field, the rdf:predicate is the second, the rdf:object is the third.  </s>
<s> Clarity only vanishes when we claim some deep metaphysical truth about  </s>
<s> *identifying* a triple with its reification.  </s>
<s> If the reification merely models the triple then it is not difficult.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> This seems fine to me.  </s>
<s> One nit...  </s>
<s> Do you mean "there being no special model theory"...  </s>
<s> I see no reason why the standard model theory should not apply -- we just don't (yet) try to say anything specific about the intended interpretation of the reserved vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Well, yes.  </s>
<s> I would personally prefer to see rdf:ID= in property elements used consistently to identify the corresponding rdf:Statement resource, etc. #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>
<s> well, in an earlier MT draft, there was some of that stuff but ... (don't get me wrong) where are we w.r.t. that???  </s>
<s> I'm much more in favor of unasserted triples like the ones in a set of statements enclosed by N3's { } or so, but that is out of scope of course :-( and so I would propose to drop reification a bit in the spirit of You know you've achieved perfection in design, Not when you have nothing more to add, But when you have nothing more to take away.  </s>

<s> Jos  </s>
<s> I'm sympathetic with what you say here, but I'm not sure that there's much we *can* (easily) say about a statement within the RDF framework as currently formalized.  </s>
<s> We might say that the intended interpretation of any instance of rdf:Statement is that it denotes some RDF statement.  </s>
<s> But what does that actually mean?  </s>
<s> What properties does an rdf:Statement instance have that distinguish it from any other RDF resource?  </s>
<s> You suggest identity conditions.  </s>
<s> But I think that could take us into an area of conflict with other work (DAML+OIL/WOL) that build on RDF.  </s>
<s> Architecturally, I think that core RDF is the wrong place to make this kind of assertion.  </s>
<s> One thing that I can imagine doing, but something that I think is beyond our current charter, is to have a way of relating an rdf:Statement instance to a truth value; i.e. a way of saying that an rdf:Statement corresponds to an asserted triple.  </s>
<s> A simple example might be similar to the style of RDFS-entailment, such that: s a rdf:Statement ; rdf:predicate pred ; rdf:subject sub ; rdf:object obj ; rdf:hasValue rdf:True .  </s>
<s> statement-entails: sub pred obj .  </s>
<s> (I don't think this particular approach is especially useful; e.g. for provenance we'd want to be able to make the entailment also depend in some way on expressed trust in the source of the statement, but I think that's still an area for experimentation.) Earmarking the vocabulary and indicating it's intended interpretation without saying anything else (yet) about its semantics, as Jeremy suggests, possibly leaves open the path to some future enhancements, without committing to exactly what they would be until we have some experimental experience.  </s>

<s> This is precisely what I had suggested some time ago with my X proposal, which also takes into account issues such as trust/authority, as well as source, authentication, scope, and all other qualifications of statements.  </s>
<s> It's just an issue of (a) having only one representation for statements and (b) shifting matters of assertion, trust, etc. to a suitable ontology (or ontologies) for qualifying statements.  </s>
<s> E.g. s a rdf:Statement ; rdf:predicate pred ; rdf:subject sub ; rdf:object obj ; rdf:assertedBy auth://abc.com/john.doe  </s>
<s> ; rdf:source http://www.abc.com/~jdoe/what-I-know.rdf ; rdf:scope dilusions ; rdf:authentication esl:SHA1:i8...a82 .  </s>
<s> and the triple s,p.o is just a resource-centric view of that knowledge derived from the qualified statement, as Graham points out.  </s>
<s> All statements are "reified", per se.  </s>
<s> Assertion is taken to be an issue of relevance to any given process -- and selection of relevant statements is based on a statement's qualification properties.  </s>
<s> I.e. assertion is a preliminary query on the statements in a knowledge base to select knowledge of relevance to a subsequent query or operation.  </s>
<s> C.f. Of course, changes of a magnitude such as suggested above are totally beyond the scope of the present charter, which is why I dropped discussion of the X proposal (for now ;-) Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> This seems to me to be the central problem.  </s>
<s> *How* will 'context' disambiguate?  </s>
<s> What context, in any case?  </s>
<s> If RDF had contexts, it would be a different language.  </s>
<s> The trouble with this kind of approach (not to reification in particular, but more generally) is that if there is no way in the language to state a distinction, and if the same constructs are used to say different kinds of things, then confusion will be inevitable.  </s>
<s> Maybe some people will manage to get by, but someone else will be confused (or, worse, some other piece of software will get confused.)  </s>
<s> Surely it is better to provide a way to state or somehow indicate the distinction, and allow both kinds of things to be said more clearly.  </s>
<s> If you want strict backward compatibility and don't like new syntactic conventions, then make the one you like best be the unmarked case and mark the other one.  </s>
<s> No, its still a problem.  </s>
<s> There are at least two distinct senses of 'model a triple' involved here, and you have to choose one of them.  </s>
<s> Other people will understand you to be meaning the other sense, however, and will draw conclusions you didn't intend.  </s>
<s> Even if you only want to use RDF for some private purpose, we have to make it capable of being published on a web and 'understood' by people/agents who have no way of knowing what we had in mind when we wrote it.  </s>

<s> This was what motivated my suggestion of two new classes rdf:Assertion and rdf:Quotation, both rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Statement, to provide a means of distinction for the purpose of intepretation.  </s>
<s> That was my take.  </s>
<s> Right. rdf:Assertion is the unmarked case, implied by actual property arcs from subject nodes to object nodes, and rdf:Quotation is available as an alternate to rdf:Statement providing for the slightly different interpretation of "utterance" rather than statement.  </s>
<s> This approach seems backwards compatable with (most) current usage while allowing those who want the quotation distinction to achieve it explicitly.  </s>
