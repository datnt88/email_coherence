<s> The part of this that throws me for a loop is that web folders expects UTF-8 encoded URLs in the href field of the PropFind response, but it does not send the same URLs back to you and instead goes out of its way to use local encoding.  </s>
<s> My observations working with web folders is that the input URL is based on the local codepage, and that accept-language is the best way I've found to guess what that code page is.  </s>
<s> Also, when web folders sees characters outside of the range of the local codepage these render as ?  </s>

<s> The form field names and values are escaped: space characters are replaced by `+', and then reserved characters are escaped as per [URL]; that is, non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by `%HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character.  </s>

<s> To process a form whose action URL is an HTTP URL and whose method is `GET', the user agent starts with the action URI and appends a `?' and the form data set, in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded' format as above.  </s>
