I just looked at draft-vandesompel-info-uri-01 for the first time, and am puzzled by something. 
The reg_name component introduced in RFC-2396 seems tailor-made for a URI scheme like info, and yet info chooses not to use it. 
RFC-2396: URI that are hierarchical in nature use the slash "/" character for separating hierarchical components. 
Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the 
URI is governed by that authority. 
This authority component is 
typically defined by an Internet-based server or a scheme-specific registry of naming authorities. 
info-uri-01: An "info-identifier" is constructed by appending an "identifier" component to a "namespace" component separated by a slash "/" character. 
The "info" URI scheme supports hierarchy as indicated by the presence of the slash "/" character. 
Values for the "namespace" component...identify the public namespace in which the (unescaped) value for the "identifier" component originates, and are registered in the "info" Registry, which guarantees their uniqueness. 
The alignment looks perfect, but info: does not use "//" and does not call its "namespace" an "authority". 
Why? 
If info: doesn't use reg_name, what ever would? 
If the approach being taken by info: is considered to be proper, then the conception of reg_name from RFC-2396 is being abandoned. 
Indeed, the reg-name token in 2396bis seems to be targeting a different 
usage. 
Whereas the RFC-2396 reg_name was a kind of non-host authority 
that could not have a port number, the 2396bis reg-name is a kind of 
host and can have a port number. 
Maybe the 2396bis vision is not to 
provide for abstract registered naming authorities as described in RFC-2396 and info-uri-01, but merely to allow network entities (hosts, 
services, domains) to be named using more naming systems than just RFC-1123 hostnames. 
Is that the intention? 
On the other hand, if the intention of 2396bis is that reg-name can 
really be an abstract naming authority, shouldn't info: be using it? 
Could there be a better candidate? 
AMC P.S. This is one of several points of confusion that perhaps a successor to RFC-2718 could address by offering more guidelines about appropriate and inappropriate uses for each component of the generic URI syntax. 
For example, it might discuss how to decide whether to use an authority, and if not, whether to use a leading slash, and when to use a fragment vs. query-string vs. path-segment vs path-segment-with-semicolons vs. userinfo. 
No. What the syntax allows and what a specific scheme uses are two 
different things. 
There is nothing wrong with a scheme that only uses a subset of the available syntax, provided it avoids the 
reserved characters that would indicate otherwise. 
Moving reg-name under host has the appropriate impact of reserving the ":" and "@" 
characters for a specific purpose, but no effect on any URI that might have been defined to use the old reg_name (which also reserved those characters). 
The result is simply less ambiguous to parse. 
The "info" scheme proposal misuses almost every single aspect of URI syntax, philosophy, technology, and accepted best practice. 
There is 
no need for it to exist at all. 
Yes, it would be better to use either 
the generic authority syntax or the URN authority syntax for new URI schemes that make use of delegated naming authorities. 
....Roy 
Well, gee Roy. 
You might like to help us out some by expanding on some of these claims.They are a little expansive. 
We are very much trying to be consistent with URI syntax, philosophy and technology and are carefully tracking latest changes in -bis. 
(I won't claim 'accepted best practice' because this is a new URI scheme which does not have comparable antecedents.) 
We have received no feedback on the list since submitting the -01 revision last December, so it is difficult to know if we have introduced elements that are inconsistent with URI practice. 
It is certainly not our intention to 'misue'. 
But somehow there is felt to be a clear need which is what is driving this application. 
There are problems with both of these approaches which have been carefully documented in the FAQ (available at http://info-uri.info/ and presented earlier on this list when the -00 draft was posted.

Sorry if I'm jumping in on this thread out-of-context (I can't find the beginning of it) but I'd like to address the subject line.... Please look at: and consider these two entries: 'lccn', and 'srw'. 
Lccn has no authority component because the info:lccn just takes an existing lccn, normalizes it, and sticks it in a uri. 
No authority, because nobody is coining the URI. 
In contrast, for srw, someone is coining the uri, and there is an authority component built into the syntax (as for several other entries .... doi and netref for example).

RFC-2396 explicitly allows unescaped colons and at-signs in reg_name, while 2396bis clearly disallows them in reg-name. 
Consider foo://a@b+c:4/. 
According to RFC-2396, there is only one way to decompose it: reg_name=a@b+c:4 there is no port there is no userinfo According to 2396bis, there is only one way to decompose it: reg-name=b+c port=4 userinfo=a Your claim of "no effect" requires me to ask: Was this new interpretation of existing URIs a goal of the grammar change, or an unanticipated side-effect of it? 
Thanks, that helps. 
In the current 2396bis draft, it's not clear (to me) that the "host" component, despite it's name, might not refer to a host at all. 
The natural assumption is of course that a component named "host" refers to a host. 
The last three paragraphs of section 3.2.2 reinforce that assumption: even as they warn that a reg-name is not necessarily a hostname, they focus on network issues that apply only to hosts, not to registry-based naming authorities like LCCN. 
The very first sentence of that section is probably left over from an earlier draft: The host sub-component of authority is identified by an IP literal encapsulated within square brackets, an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form, or a host name. 
Maybe something like this would clarify your intended semantics: The host sub-component of authority is either an IP literal encapsulated within square brackets, an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form, or a registered name. 
If it's a name, it can refer to a network host or some other kind of naming authority (the sub-component is called host for historical reasons). 
AMC 
I have now read the FAQ. 
I looked for a description of problems with the generic-authority approach, and this was the closest I could find: 
Location dependence - URI schemes are variously categorized as 
location-dependent or location-independent with respect to whether the URI contains a network authority component. 
The FAQ consistently puts the word "network" in front of the phrase "authority component", as if the //authority component of a URI can refer only to network entities. 
But the authority component is not restricted to network entities, and was introduced in RFC-2396 to remove that restriction. 
RFC-1738: //login (IP-based user@host:port) RFC-1808: //net_loc (same thing, renamed) RFC-2396: //authority authority = server | reg_name (server is another renaming of net_loc/login, reg_name is new) It seems to me that reg_name was introduced specifically to hold names like info's namespace component. 
(I just wish it had been introduced in a way that avoided type-ambiguity. 
In foo://bar/, is bar a hostname or not? 
You can't know unless you know the foo scheme. 
I wonder if it's not too late to fix that. 
Even while I'm arguing that info: ignores the intent of RFC-2396, I worry that conforming to that intent would create problems.) 
Please look at: http://info-uri.info/registry and consider these two entries: 'lccn', and 'srw'. 
Lccn has no authority component because the info:lccn just takes an existing lccn, normalizes it, and sticks it in a uri. 
No authority, because nobody is coining the URI. 
I don't see how that matters. 
RFC-2396 says: 
Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming 
authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the 
URI is governed by that authority. 
I think that describes lccn as well as it describes srw. 
The string "lccn" is mapped by the info registry to something (a spec or an organization or a series of specs issued by an organization or whatever) that governs the syntax and semantics of the rest of the path. 
By the way, there is something screwy about the web server at info-uri.info. 
Apparently, if the User-Agent request field is absent or begins with anything other than "Mozilla", a cryptic XML error page is returned. 
AMC 
From: "Adam M. Costello BOGUS address, see signature" 
Lccn has no authority component because the info:lccn just takes an existing lccn, normalizes it, and 
sticks 
it in a uri. 
No authority, because nobody is coining the URI. 
the 
But nobody (person or agent) has the authority to coins an info:lccn uri. 
A given string either is or isn't one: if it is of the form 'info:lccn/xxx' and there exists an lccn that normalizes to 'xxx' then it is, if not it isn't. 
And in the latter case, in the future when such an lccn does exists then that string becomes an info:lccn uri automatically, upon assignment of the lccn. 
So I'm not sure what an authority component adds. 
--Ray 
Ray Denenberg, Library of Congress scripsit: 
You talk as if LCCNs grew on trees, literally. 
The authority to coin an info:lccn URI is one and the same with the authority to assign the corresponding LCCN, just as is the case with urn:isbn URIs, since the 
meaning of the URI is tied to the meaning of the "number". 
In effect, then, the authority component of LCCNs is "lccn".

Good. 
Then info *does* have an authority component. 
Its the info namespace (see info scheme bnf at 
--Ray 
No, it has has an arbitrarily different syntax that serves the same purpose as the authority component in the generic syntax. 
The urn scheme has one as well -- that has proven to be a bad idea. 
The point was that a generic concept like naming authorities should be expressed using a generic syntax, since then you get implementations for free, which is especially valuable given the cost of maintaining a delegated naming system. 
....Roy 
Roy T. Fielding scripsit: 
Can you elaborate on this latter point? 
My objection to info: has been precisely that it should be split up into a number of urn: schemes. 
Knowledge studies others / Wisdom is self-known; John Cowan 
Muscle masters brothers / Self-mastery is bone; jcowan@reutershealth.com Content need never borrow / Ambition wanders blind; www.ccil.org/~cowan 
Vitality cleaves to the marrow / Leaving death behind. 
--Tao 33 (Bynner) 
Yes, that was my objection as well. 
The different authority syntax for urn prevented its deployment for many years, but I think that has finally been resolved. 
URNs would have been deployed in 1994, at least in terms of WWW client and proxy behavior, were it not for a 
disagreement over the syntax. 
New schemes should learn from that lesson 
and try to be uniform whenever possible, ....Roy 
Query this statement about 'uniformity'. 
Do we not need to distinguish between identifier authorities and namespace authorities? 
INFO like URN is only a namespace authority (i.e. we are seeking to deal with the issue of namespace delegation) and cannot (and will not and must not) vouch for identifiers minted under those namespaces. 
In essence, INFO is just a URN-lite introduced because of technical and social (read cultural) problems with registering new URN NIDs. 
(One could argue that INFO is redundant and everything can be done under URN. 
But actual practice is clearly and significantly otherwise and the Web continues to remain hostile to accepting new information spaces. 
The issue is real, persistent and will not go away.) BTW - I fail to discover any injunction in the following extracts that a (namespace) authority must/should be disclosed within a URI string and that 'uniformity' requires any such disclosure. 
Maybe lack of any authority component should be a deprecated feature of URIs - if that would be the right thing to do. 
But is it now? 
[rfc 2396] 3.2. 
Authority Component Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the URI is governed by that authority. 
This authority component is typically defined by an Internet-based server or a scheme-specific registry of naming authorities. 
[2396bis-04] 3.2 Authority Many URI schemes include a hierarchical element for a naming authority, such that governance of the name space defined by the remainder of the URI is delegated to that authority (which may, in turn, delegate it further). 
The generic syntax provides a common means for distinguishing an authority based on a registered name or server address, along with optional port and user information.
