<s> I just looked at draft-vandesompel-info-uri-01 for the first time, and am puzzled by something.  </s>
<s> The reg_name component introduced in RFC-2396 seems tailor-made for a URI scheme like info, and yet info chooses not to use it.  </s>
<s> RFC-2396: URI that are hierarchical in nature use the slash "/" character for separating hierarchical components.  </s>
<s> Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the  </s>
<s> URI is governed by that authority.  </s>
<s> This authority component is  </s>
<s> typically defined by an Internet-based server or a scheme-specific registry of naming authorities.  </s>
<s> info-uri-01: An "info-identifier" is constructed by appending an "identifier" component to a "namespace" component separated by a slash "/" character.  </s>
<s> The "info" URI scheme supports hierarchy as indicated by the presence of the slash "/" character.  </s>
<s> Values for the "namespace" component...identify the public namespace in which the (unescaped) value for the "identifier" component originates, and are registered in the "info" Registry, which guarantees their uniqueness.  </s>
<s> The alignment looks perfect, but info: does not use "//" and does not call its "namespace" an "authority".  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> If info: doesn't use reg_name, what ever would?  </s>
<s> If the approach being taken by info: is considered to be proper, then the conception of reg_name from RFC-2396 is being abandoned.  </s>
<s> Indeed, the reg-name token in 2396bis seems to be targeting a different  </s>
<s> usage.  </s>
<s> Whereas the RFC-2396 reg_name was a kind of non-host authority  </s>
<s> that could not have a port number, the 2396bis reg-name is a kind of  </s>
<s> host and can have a port number.  </s>
<s> Maybe the 2396bis vision is not to  </s>
<s> provide for abstract registered naming authorities as described in RFC-2396 and info-uri-01, but merely to allow network entities (hosts,  </s>
<s> services, domains) to be named using more naming systems than just RFC-1123 hostnames.  </s>
<s> Is that the intention?  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if the intention of 2396bis is that reg-name can  </s>
<s> really be an abstract naming authority, shouldn't info: be using it?  </s>
<s> Could there be a better candidate?  </s>
<s> AMC P.S. This is one of several points of confusion that perhaps a successor to RFC-2718 could address by offering more guidelines about appropriate and inappropriate uses for each component of the generic URI syntax.  </s>
<s> For example, it might discuss how to decide whether to use an authority, and if not, whether to use a leading slash, and when to use a fragment vs. query-string vs. path-segment vs path-segment-with-semicolons vs. userinfo.  </s>
<s> No. What the syntax allows and what a specific scheme uses are two  </s>
<s> different things.  </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with a scheme that only uses a subset of the available syntax, provided it avoids the  </s>
<s> reserved characters that would indicate otherwise.  </s>
<s> Moving reg-name under host has the appropriate impact of reserving the ":" and "@"  </s>
<s> characters for a specific purpose, but no effect on any URI that might have been defined to use the old reg_name (which also reserved those characters).  </s>
<s> The result is simply less ambiguous to parse.  </s>
<s> The "info" scheme proposal misuses almost every single aspect of URI syntax, philosophy, technology, and accepted best practice.  </s>
<s> There is  </s>
<s> no need for it to exist at all.  </s>
<s> Yes, it would be better to use either  </s>
<s> the generic authority syntax or the URN authority syntax for new URI schemes that make use of delegated naming authorities.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> Well, gee Roy.  </s>
<s> You might like to help us out some by expanding on some of these claims.They are a little expansive.  </s>
<s> We are very much trying to be consistent with URI syntax, philosophy and technology and are carefully tracking latest changes in -bis.  </s>
<s> (I won't claim 'accepted best practice' because this is a new URI scheme which does not have comparable antecedents.)  </s>
<s> We have received no feedback on the list since submitting the -01 revision last December, so it is difficult to know if we have introduced elements that are inconsistent with URI practice.  </s>
<s> It is certainly not our intention to 'misue'.  </s>
<s> But somehow there is felt to be a clear need which is what is driving this application.  </s>
<s> There are problems with both of these approaches which have been carefully documented in the FAQ (available at http://info-uri.info/ and presented earlier on this list when the -00 draft was posted.  </s>

<s> Thanks, that helps.  </s>
<s> In the current 2396bis draft, it's not clear (to me) that the "host" component, despite it's name, might not refer to a host at all.  </s>
<s> The natural assumption is of course that a component named "host" refers to a host.  </s>
<s> The last three paragraphs of section 3.2.2 reinforce that assumption: even as they warn that a reg-name is not necessarily a hostname, they focus on network issues that apply only to hosts, not to registry-based naming authorities like LCCN.  </s>
<s> The very first sentence of that section is probably left over from an earlier draft: The host sub-component of authority is identified by an IP literal encapsulated within square brackets, an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form, or a host name.  </s>
<s> Maybe something like this would clarify your intended semantics: The host sub-component of authority is either an IP literal encapsulated within square brackets, an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form, or a registered name.  </s>
<s> If it's a name, it can refer to a network host or some other kind of naming authority (the sub-component is called host for historical reasons).  </s>

<s> I have now read the FAQ.  </s>

<s> location-dependent or location-independent with respect to whether the URI contains a network authority component.  </s>
<s> The FAQ consistently puts the word "network" in front of the phrase "authority component", as if the //authority component of a URI can refer only to network entities.  </s>
<s> But the authority component is not restricted to network entities, and was introduced in RFC-2396 to remove that restriction.  </s>
<s> RFC-1738: //login (IP-based user@host:port) RFC-1808: //net_loc (same thing, renamed) RFC-2396: //authority authority = server | reg_name (server is another renaming of net_loc/login, reg_name is new) It seems to me that reg_name was introduced specifically to hold names like info's namespace component.  </s>
<s> (I just wish it had been introduced in a way that avoided type-ambiguity.  </s>
<s> In foo://bar/, is bar a hostname or not?  </s>
<s> You can't know unless you know the foo scheme.  </s>
<s> I wonder if it's not too late to fix that.  </s>
<s> Even while I'm arguing that info: ignores the intent of RFC-2396, I worry that conforming to that intent would create problems.)  </s>
<s> Please look at: http://info-uri.info/registry and consider these two entries: 'lccn', and 'srw'.  </s>
<s> Lccn has no authority component because the info:lccn just takes an existing lccn, normalizes it, and sticks it in a uri.  </s>

<s> The string "lccn" is mapped by the info registry to something (a spec or an organization or a series of specs issued by an organization or whatever) that governs the syntax and semantics of the rest of the path.  </s>

<s> Query this statement about 'uniformity'.  </s>
<s> Do we not need to distinguish between identifier authorities and namespace authorities?  </s>
<s> INFO like URN is only a namespace authority (i.e. we are seeking to deal with the issue of namespace delegation) and cannot (and will not and must not) vouch for identifiers minted under those namespaces.  </s>
<s> In essence, INFO is just a URN-lite introduced because of technical and social (read cultural) problems with registering new URN NIDs.  </s>
<s> (One could argue that INFO is redundant and everything can be done under URN.  </s>
<s> But actual practice is clearly and significantly otherwise and the Web continues to remain hostile to accepting new information spaces.  </s>
<s> The issue is real, persistent and will not go away.) BTW - I fail to discover any injunction in the following extracts that a (namespace) authority must/should be disclosed within a URI string and that 'uniformity' requires any such disclosure.  </s>
