The 'mailto' [1] and proposed 'sms' [2] schemes allow multiple resources to be identified by a single URI; e.g., sms:+41796431851,+4116321035 Is this encouraged in new schemes? 
I.e., is it a good idea to have a one-to-many uri-to-resource mapping?

The first paragraph of the Introduction in RFC2368 not withstanding, I think both documents identify an action ("send mail this way", or "send an sms this way") instead of actual mailboxes or end points. 
I would prefer documents to be precise about what they actually identify but as long as they do so and people use the identifier in a way consistent with that statement then I think its ok.... 
In other words, the SMS document has it right: the URI here identifies and "SMS message" not the end point for an SMS message. 
An end point is needed as part of an "SMS message" in order to be meaninful but it isn't the end point that's being identified. 
In many cases people have been using mailto:foo@bar.com 
to identify the human user who currently 'uses' that mailbox and IMHO, that's also a serious semantic mistake... -MM

I'm a bit surprised by this; I had though that it was agreed that mailto specifically does not specify an action, but only identifies a mailbox; it's up to the consumer of the URI to determine what to do with it when it's dereferenced. 
Where does it say this? 
The abstract says This memo specifies a URI (Universal Resource Identifier) scheme "sms" for specifying a recipient (and optionally a gateway) for an SMS message. 
I'd think that identifying messages is best left to mechanisms like mid's. 
I'd agree with that; one should say 'the person who uses the mailbox foo@bar.com'; 
e.g., [ foaf:mbox foo@bar.com 
]

If it identified just the actual mailbox then you shouldn't be able to specify things like a Subject since mailboxes don't have Subjects. 
Maybe the word 'action' is wrong. 
Hmm... the 'message' itself? 
I dunno how to say it exactly. 
But 'mailbox' isn't right either.... 
If its only a recipient then how can it contain the body of the message that's going to be sent to the recipient(s)?

mailto allows you to specify a subject, body, etc. in the query component, which is defined by 2396 as: "...a string of information to be interpreted by the resource." 
Considering other uses of queries, this seems to fit in nicely. the argument bar=baz, and it also affects the message sent when dereferencing the URI. 
mailto:bob@example.net?Subject=Make+Money+Now can cause a message with that subject to be sent when dereferenced, but it can also be used to locate a message in the mailbox. 
sms uses a parameter to specify a body, which seems broken. 
This is one of the things I'll be commenting about.

This touches on something that's been on my mind for a while. 
If a query is "a string of information to be interpreted by the resource," isn't it the case that a URI with a query refers to a resource, rather than just identifies one? 
E.g., http://www.example.com/foo?bar=baz is a reference to the resource http://www.example.com/foo . 
I.e., shouldn't the definition of URI-Reference (rather than URI) 
include not only fragments, but also queries? 
Mark Nottingham 
Definitions are often choosen on their practical value, rather than on philosophical considerations. 
In this case, the URI is what you (e.g.) send to the server, the URI Reference is what you (e.g.) put into an attribute.
