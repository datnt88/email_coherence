<s> The 'mailto' [1] and proposed 'sms' [2] schemes allow multiple resources to be identified by a single URI; e.g., sms:+41796431851,+4116321035 Is this encouraged in new schemes?  </s>
<s> I.e., is it a good idea to have a one-to-many uri-to-resource mapping?  </s>

<s> The first paragraph of the Introduction in RFC2368 not withstanding, I think both documents identify an action ("send mail this way", or "send an sms this way") instead of actual mailboxes or end points.  </s>
<s> I would prefer documents to be precise about what they actually identify but as long as they do so and people use the identifier in a way consistent with that statement then I think its ok....  </s>
<s> In other words, the SMS document has it right: the URI here identifies and "SMS message" not the end point for an SMS message.  </s>
<s> An end point is needed as part of an "SMS message" in order to be meaninful but it isn't the end point that's being identified.  </s>
<s> In many cases people have been using mailto:foo@bar.com  </s>
<s> to identify the human user who currently 'uses' that mailbox and IMHO, that's also a serious semantic mistake... -MM  </s>

<s> I'm a bit surprised by this; I had though that it was agreed that mailto specifically does not specify an action, but only identifies a mailbox; it's up to the consumer of the URI to determine what to do with it when it's dereferenced.  </s>
<s> Where does it say this?  </s>
<s> The abstract says This memo specifies a URI (Universal Resource Identifier) scheme "sms" for specifying a recipient (and optionally a gateway) for an SMS message.  </s>
<s> I'd think that identifying messages is best left to mechanisms like mid's.  </s>
<s> I'd agree with that; one should say 'the person who uses the mailbox foo@bar.com';  </s>
<s> e.g., [ foaf:mbox foo@bar.com  </s>

<s> Mark Nottingham  </s>
<s> If it identified just the actual mailbox then you shouldn't be able to specify things like a Subject since mailboxes don't have Subjects.  </s>
<s> Maybe the word 'action' is wrong.  </s>
<s> Hmm... the 'message' itself?  </s>
<s> I dunno how to say it exactly.  </s>
<s> But 'mailbox' isn't right either....  </s>
<s> If its only a recipient then how can it contain the body of the message that's going to be sent to the recipient(s)?  </s>

<s> mailto allows you to specify a subject, body, etc. in the query component, which is defined by 2396 as: "...a string of information to be interpreted by the resource."  </s>
<s> Considering other uses of queries, this seems to fit in nicely. the argument bar=baz, and it also affects the message sent when dereferencing the URI.  </s>
<s> mailto:bob@example.net?Subject=Make+Money+Now can cause a message with that subject to be sent when dereferenced, but it can also be used to locate a message in the mailbox.  </s>
<s> sms uses a parameter to specify a body, which seems broken.  </s>
<s> This is one of the things I'll be commenting about.  </s>
<s> Mark Nottingham  </s>
<s> This touches on something that's been on my mind for a while.  </s>
<s> If a query is "a string of information to be interpreted by the resource," isn't it the case that a URI with a query refers to a resource, rather than just identifies one?  </s>
<s> E.g., http://www.example.com/foo?bar=baz is a reference to the resource http://www.example.com/foo .  </s>
<s> I.e., shouldn't the definition of URI-Reference (rather than URI)  </s>
<s> include not only fragments, but also queries?  </s>
<s> Mark Nottingham  </s>
<s> Definitions are often choosen on their practical value, rather than on philosophical considerations.  </s>
<s> In this case, the URI is what you (e.g.) send to the server, the URI Reference is what you (e.g.) put into an attribute.  </s>
