<s> At yesterdays telecon, by majority vote, we took two decisions about datatyping which, if taken together, make RDF datatyping effectively unusable by anyone except librarians.  </s>
<s> I cannot produce a coherent model theory for datatyping which satisfies both of these conditions at the same time, and would suggest that one of them should be reconsidered.  </s>
<s> This message tries to briefly explain the problem, and suggest some alternative ways out of it.  </s>
<s> I recommend option C below.  </s>
<s> The decisions were that (1) we should support the S-B idiom: Jenny ex:age "10" .  </s>
<s> ex:age rdfs:range xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> and (2) that the literal in such examples should denote itself, ie the above asserts that Jenny's age is the string '10'.  </s>
<s> (BTW, I know I voted for 1, but at the time I didn't think that anyone who voted for 1 could possibly vote for 2 as well.  </s>
<s> )  </s>
<s> The problem with this combination is that it seems to have the inevitable consequence that the class named by a datatype name must be the set of *lexical forms* of that datatype, rather than the value  </s>
<s> space of the datatype.  </s>
<s> In this example, it requires RDF to treat xsd:number as a class of numerals - character strings which denote numbers - rather than a class of numbers.  </s>
<s> The problem now is that if that is what the datatype class name is used for, then there is no way to refer to the class of values of a datatype.  </s>
<s> This might be appropriate for an ontology dealing with documents, of course, such as Dublin Core or SS/BB, but it is fatal for any kind of applied ontology work or interfacing to most applications, and will be immediately (and correctly) rejected by DAML+OIL and Webont as unacceptable and unworkable.  </s>
<s> Now, one option here would be to just smile at this - after all, we are the RDF WG, not Webont - but I would suggest that if we are at all interested in the possibility of RDF being acceptable as a foundation for any more ambitious efforts, rather than an dead end, we should pay attention to the likely needs of most people on the planet, who will want to use numerals to refer to numbers, rather than treating the entire XML datatyping scheme as a way of  </s>
<s> classifying character strings.  </s>
<s> I have been trying to come up with some way out of this dilemma, and there are several options I can see.  </s>
<s> Right now I personally prefer B, but think that C is the best (simplest) compromise, and one that would be acceptable to the most people (both on and off the WG). A. The S-B idiom could be replaced by something more complicated which expresses the intended restriction of the literal to the space of lexical forms of the datatype.  </s>
<s> For example, it could be done by replacing the rdfs:range assertion by the linked pair of range assertions:  </s>
<s> ex:age rdfs:range _:x .  </s>
<s> xsd:integer rdfs:range _:x .  </s>
<s> If that is acceptable, then that solves the problem, since it frees up the datatype name itself to have the value space as its extension when used as a class name.  </s>
<s> However, I have a nagging feeling that it  </s>
<s> will not be acceptable to some people, since anyone who thinks that S-B is meaningful as it stands is probably under the impression that datatype class names *do* refer to sets of lexical forms, and will therefore find this puzzling.  </s>
<s> That would require us to reconsider decision (1).  </s>
<s> B. We could follow the approach outlined in ***Note, there are still some bugs in the MT equations in that document.***.  </s>
<s> which supports the the S-B idiom, but assigns it a different meaning: according to this approach, Jenny's age would be ten rather than '10'.  </s>
<s> However, the intended restriction to the datatype range works, eg the literal "humpty" rather than a numeral would still produce a datatyping error.  </s>
<s> This proposal also the merit of not requiring the use of rdfs:drange; it works by 'overloading' rdf:range.  </s>
<s> It can also, with a little tweaking to the MT, be used with tidy literal nodes (and although, as noted in the document, that would need to be revised if literals were allowed to be subjects, I would predict that tidy literal nodes would need to be reconsidered in that case anyway.)  </s>
<s> I believe this is the first proposal that combines tidy literals with the possibility of having datatype-sensitive denotations for literals, by the way.  </s>
<s> That would require us to reconsider decision (2) C. (New idea, see for a write-up.)  </s>
<s> If we are willing to re-introduce rdfs:dtype (or some other special vocabulary) then it is possible to combine the two decisions coherently, with the S-B idiom suitably modified.  </s>
<s> That is, we can use rdfs:dtype to impose 'lexical' constraints on the in-line literal use, as in S-B, and also 'value' constraints on the bnode idiom: Jimmy ex:age _:x .  </s>
<s> _:x rdfs:dlex "10" .  </s>
<s> at the same time, without getting the ranges mixed up.  </s>
<s> The first asserts that Jenny's age is the lexical form '10'; the second asserts that Jimmy's age is the number ten.  </s>
<s> The idea here is that the rdfs:drange assertion is used PURELY to assign datatype restrictions to properties, and says NOTHING AT ALL about their ranges.  </s>
<s> So rdfs:drange and rdfs:range are completely independent; neither is assumed to be a subproperty of the other.  </s>
<s> This frees up the rdfs:drange from any commitment to the rdfs class interpretation of the datatype, and allows us to continue to utilize the class name to refer to the value class (and use the idiom suggested in A above to refer to the lexical class, if required) independently of the imposition of datatyping conditions.  </s>
<s> Of course we cannot use rdfs:range in this case, so this would require us to reconsider decision (1); but the required change is minimal.  </s>
<s> In many ways C, is the 'leanest' option so far, in the sense that it provides the most flexibility with the minimum of syntactic and MT complexity; it uses tidy literals which always denote themselves, and leaves the undatatyped MT completely unchanged.  </s>

<s> I have no problem with the basic concept behind this, but I think that this specific version of it isn't going to work since it's impossible to write in RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> I think Brian made it very clear that the range in one wasn't necessarily rdfs:range.  </s>
<s> It could also be rdfd:range.  </s>

<s> One way to express the above semantics, which I've proposed before with no response whatsoever from anyone, is to use a specific range property that asserts a lexical space specific constraint on property values.  </s>
<s> I.e. rdfs:lrange.  </s>
<s> It can be easily expressed in RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> It has clear, reasonably mnemonic meaning to users.  </s>
<s> It leaves rdfs:range to denote constraint to value space.  </s>
<s> It is close enough to rdfs:range that it will seem familiar while having a mnemonic distinction (l for lexical).  </s>
<s> I'm not saying yet which of the three proposals, if any, I wan't to vote for (have to sleep on it a bit) but I think rdfs:lrange would sufficiently address the objections to the expression of this particular approach.  </s>
<s> That's true.  </s>
<s> Though from the perspective of the less-technical users, a somewhat mnemonic property would I think be appreciated, and the least amount of new vocabulary as possible.  </s>
<s> Using rdfs:range and rdfs:lrange provides that and covers the bases.  </s>
<s> Of course, no matter what we call the ranges or how we express them, having range constraints for both value and lexical space in the same graph will raise a conflict.  </s>
<s> This is a problem with cohabitation of the inline and bNode idioms that was pointed out since the earliest considerations of S. If we are to allow both idioms to co-exist in the same graph, and I think we must, then we will need a third "flavor" of range constraint -- one which allows members of either lexical or value space, leaving it to the graph syntax (literal or bNode) to discern the distinction.  </s>
<s> If it is a literal, it is a member of the lexcal space.  </s>
<s> If it is a bNode, it denotes a member of the value space.  </s>
<s> I think that perhaps Pat's finding of such a "union" range constraint as unworkable hinges on the fact that it treats the internal structure of the datatype as opaque, not concerning itself about whether there actually are two different spaces and what their relationship is, but just treats all members of all spaces as equal members of the *RDF* datatype class.  </s>
<s> It may very well be that this is too ambiguous for e.g. entailment proofs (though I'm not sure we have fully explored the options there) but it does meet the needs to express datatyping in both inline and bNode idioms and constrain property ranges to either flavor of idiom.  </s>
<s> I don't want to reduce the utility of RDF datatyping for WebOnt, but at the same time, don't want to see it too cumbersome and confusing for the metadata and content management communities also.  </s>
<s> And there  </s>
<s> is always the option of providing a solution now that has minimal definition in the MT and the remainder expressed in axiomatic rules and by other explicit means (even if less formal that the MT) which captures the idioms and expected meaning of them insofar as humans are concerned, and then continue to work on a more comprehensive MT treatment of datatyping in terms of the MT -- i.e. if we decide at this very moment in time to only capture pairings in the MT, per the "Dummies" proposal, that doesn't mean that we have given up on an MT account of datatyping suitable for WebOnt, only that that must come as a subsequent (possibly immediate) next step, either by us (if we still have time/energy) or by WebOnt or some other WG. Need to think on this still a little bit (as I'm sure we all do).  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> Following Patrick's suggestion, I would like to urge that we allow the use of rdfs:lrange.  </s>
<s> I know this looks like terminology-bloat, but it makes possible a very elegant and I think easy-to-use way to display the user options (see *** below).  </s>
<s> In the interests of everyone's sanity, I will not put this up as yet another web document.  </s>
<s> Right, I like this idea and suggest that we adopt it.  </s>
<s> So the definition of rdfs:lrange is as follows: aaa rdfs:lrange ddd .  </s>
<s> means that the rdfs:range of aaa is the lexical space of the datatype ddd .  </s>
<s> (The MT is: IEXT(I(rdfs:lrange)) = { x,y : u,v in IEXT(x) implies L2V(y)(v) is defined } That makes this synonymous with aaa rdfs:range _:x .  </s>
<s> ddd rdfs:range _:x .  </s>
<s> but we can relegate that to an appendix somewhere.  </s>
<s> We also have to say what rdfs:lrange means if ddd is not a datatype.  </s>
<s> It could still mean the same as the bnode pair, or it could be vacuous.  </s>
<s> Whatever, a technical niggle.)  </s>
<s> Fair enough, even though our priorities differ.  </s>
<s> I really do not think that this proposal is cumbersome or confusing.  </s>
<s> Clear your minds for a second of all the debates, take a deep breath, and imagine, if you can, a blank sheet of paper, and then write this on it: aaa rdfs:range xsd:number .  </s>
<s> just means the range of aaa is the set of numbers, ie the value space of the datatype (and has no special datatyping effect on any literals.) aaa rdfs:lrange xsd:number .  </s>
<s> just means the range of aaa is the set of numerals, ie the lexical space of the datatype (and has no special datatyping effect on any literals.) aaa rdfs:drange xsd:number .  </s>
<s> doesn't say ANYTHING about the rdfs:range, but it does impose datatype-checking on literals (used in either mode, ie with an rdfs:dlex triple - when the bnode is constrained to the datatype value of the literal - or the S-B idiom - when the literal is constrained to be in the lexical space of the datatype; see the figure in Intuitively, the first is all about the value space, the second is all about the lexical space, and the last is all about the lexical-to-value mapping (and what it does to literals).  </s>
<s> So if you want to be DC-sloppy, just use rdfs:drange; you get full datatype checking but no range constraints.  </s>
<s> (The range could be the union in this case, or it could be something else.) If you want to be precise about your ranges, use one of the first two options.  </s>
<s> If you want to be precise and also use datatype-checking, use one of the first two plus the third (it works with either one equally well, so that range precision can be added later without having to re-do the datatyping).  </s>
<s> If you want to be precise about ranges, do datatyping and ALSO allow sloppiness, all at the same time, then you have to be slightly clever, and use three properties such as ageAsNumber/ageAsString/age, with the first two being subproperties of the last one and the three options applied to each one (in that order.) This provides both 'exact' options and also the 'sloppy' option, but the same datatyping works for them all.  </s>
<s> This is the only time you have to think about schemas.  </s>
<s> Pat PS.  </s>
<s> Just as a general plea to the WG: OK, we have to coddle our DC-style users.  </s>
<s> But please, guys, bear in mind that having RDF be a foundation for Webont is not just a sci-fi fantasy.  </s>
<s> It is really the only long-term reason for having RDF around.  </s>
<s> It is vitally important that RDF be provided with at least a minimal ability to express what needs to be said in a semantically precise way.  </s>
<s> It is going to have to be able to express, maybe indirectly, *any* content that can be said in *any* Web language.  </s>
<s> Already there is enormous 'layering' hooha going on which arises from RDF's weaknesses as a foundation.  </s>
<s> If we make it so dumbed-down that it can ONLY be used for DC-style apps, then we will have shot Webont in the foot.  </s>
<s> PPS.  </s>
<s> It occurs to me that we could use the name rdfs:dcrange rather than drange, and say that it means "Datatype Check on range".  </s>
<s> That might make the DC users feel even more at home.  </s>

<s> There was no requirement in what we agreed that the range constraint property was rdfs:range or that value of the property was xsd:integer.  </s>
<s> No. What we decided leaves us free to use a different range property or xsd:integer.lex.  </s>
<s> In my view, webont are a very important customer of our work.  </s>
<s> When I took this on, I believed that the major challenge we faced is that RDF is trying to serve two masters, those who want a simple meta data language and those who want a formal foundation for it.  </s>
<s> That's hard, but that is what we are trying to do.  </s>
<s> At the very least we must not mess things up for webont to build on rdf.  </s>
