<s> What happens if they want to rely upon the HTTP header to carry that information?  </s>
<s> What happens if the type KeyInfo object changes (a newer version with a tweaked namespace) and while they want the URIof the KeyInfo signed, they don't want its Type signed and consequently don't have the ability to change it?  </s>
<s> Since we aren't specifying any MANDATORY application behavior with respect to type, why REQUIRE the syntax?  </s>
<s> I'm not wondering if it's easy to do, I'm wondering what requiring it benefits?  </s>
