<s> The objectreference to X in M MUST use an xpath of string(child::text()) followed by a base64 decode (Rich must uses these transforms whether he acknowledges it or not).  </s>
<s> Yes, I acknowledge this approach if we are using XPath.  </s>
<s> Another possibility would be to define and name a transform which performs these two functions (we need one for base64-decode anyway).  </s>
<s> We could even define "safe" transforms, and surely this one will be both common and safe.  </s>
<s> Rich indicated that he did not like the manifest idea and wanted core behavior to do the work.  </s>
<s> The stated reason was so that he could get off-the-shelf software to do the work.  </s>
<s> Yet, it is quite likely that vendors will implement the manifest part of the spec, making API calls available to applications like CoreValidate() and ManifestValidate().  </s>
<s> One extra function call is not a lot to ask!  </s>
<s> If manifest is likely to be implemented, perhaps we should make it part of core behavior.  </s>
<s> It does seem unlikely that core behavior will be modified to solve this problem since it REQUIRES the ability to transform the ObjectReferences in SignedInfo.  </s>

<s> Hi Rich, If manifest is likely to be implemented, perhaps we should make it part of core behavior.  </s>
<s> I honestly don't understand why we are shoving a common problem toward local hacks.  </s>
<s> Where's the interoperability of our spec?  </s>
<s> Sure, we can tell them how to work around it (they'll never see this discussion), or let them figure a way out.  </s>
<s> But it is a workaround for a shortcoming of the spec, IMO.  </s>
<s> I agree about it being a shortcoming in the spec, which is how I represented it at FTF#2.  </s>
<s> Although everyone hated the SignedInfo transform, your suggestion to make Manifest part of core twigged a sequence of ideas: How about this.  </s>
<s> In SignedInfo, we have either an Object (for those who want small signatures) or a single ObjectReference.  </s>
<s> But what if ObjectReference had an extra attribute that controlled whether or not its DigestValue has to be checked.  </s>
<s> Then, what if this attribute were carried forward to ObjectReferences appearing in a Manifest.  </s>
<s> AND, what if the ObjectReference in SignedInfo pointed to a Manifest.  </s>
<s> Now, we have overcome the technical shortcoming.  </s>
<s> Manifest under its current definition doesn't validate the DigestValue entries of its ObjectReferences, and this can still be done with the suggestion above by having ObjectReferences whose attributes indicate no DigestValue validation.  </s>
<s> For your problem, the Manifest would indicate an element X containing the base-64 encode version of a PDF document using an ObjectReference having an attribute indicating that the DigestValue should be validated.  </s>
<s> The signature's SignedInfo would indicate the Manifest in an ObjectReference, and the Transform in that ObjectReference would omit the Location, IDRef, base64 transform and Xpath string(child::text()).  </s>
<s> This allows you change the location without breaking the signature WITH A CORE SIGNATURE THAT IS SECURE because the Manifest transform in SignedInfo is COMPLETELY SIGNED!! In conclusion, all of SignedInfo would be signed (!), and in particular, and more importantly the signature includes the entire transform that controls what part of the manifest is omitted.  </s>
<s> This is the same as my 'bottom turtle' approach, except that it doesn't seem like a hack in core behavior.  </s>
<s> Best of all, we've only added *one* attribute to our current syntax!  </s>
<s> Can someone shoot themselves in the foot by transforming the DigestValue or DigestMethod out of the manifest.  </s>
<s> Of course they can, but they can do that with our spec now.  </s>
<s> However, in both the current spec and in this proposal, it is easy to determine that the signature should be thrown out and the document developer shot because the complete manifest transform is signed.  </s>
<s> So, the ONLY thing new in this proposal is the addition of an ObjectReference attribute that would require Manifest to validate an ObjectReference's DigestValue, which would allow generic scenarios such as those proposed by Rich and Larry to be verifiable with core processing rules.  </s>
<s> John Boyer Software Development Manager UWI.Com -- The Internet Forms Company P.S. Adding another transform to do an XPath string(child::text()) is, to me, as undesirable as the addition of IDREF.  </s>
<s> Basically, XPath can already identify elements by an Id attribute, and it can even do so in the absence of a validating processor.  </s>
<s> The point being that if you don't want to implement full XPath compliance you don't have to.  </s>
<s> In your app you can choose to only support specific XPath phrases like string(child::text()) and /descendant::node()[@id='X'].  </s>
<s> These phrases will be interoperable with applications that choose to fully support XPath or any superset of your phrase selection.  </s>
<s> To me it would be better to require support for specific phrases than to create alternate syntax that duplicates the abilities of XPath.  </s>
<s> But, for what it's worth, if it makes somebody's life easier, then I'm not so interested in preventing duplication of XPath capabilities as I am in having XPath in the first place.  </s>
<s> It does seem unlikely that core behavior will be modified to solve this problem since it REQUIRES the ability to transform the ObjectReferences in SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> To the extent that this is an unpopular idea is the same extent to which it is decided that scenarios like those described by Rich and Larry are application-specific.  </s>

<s> Agreed. Good post, John.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Rich  </s>
<s> It finally clicked with me how John's XPath exclusions (aka closure) are restricting what can be added to the manifest (anything else breaks the signature).  </s>
<s> Brilliant!  </s>
<s> The simple change he is proposing satisfies my requirements.  </s>
<s> It allows changes in location from internal (base64) to external (raw), external to internal, and external to external by allowing one or more of these specific transforms (or locations) to be changed without breaking the signature.  </s>
<s> At the same time, it prevents arbitrary transforms because they  </s>
<s> break the manifest signature, so security is maintained.  </s>
<s> I think this adds a lot of power and flexibility to the standard (it resolves my outstanding  </s>
<s> problems), and includes these new capabilities in core behavior.  </s>
<s> Are there any objections to this approach?  </s>

<s> Since the majority WG opinion is against option 1, it seems that our chairs should bring about a decision process so the WG can close this issue.  </s>
<s> It is true that a major problem with the idea of transforming SignedInfo was that that the transform affected itself.  </s>
<s> By having the transform only affect a single ObjectReferece or block of ObjectReferecnes, but not itself, you get rid of that problem.  </s>
<s> However, having to have transforms at all for very common cases still seems ugly to me.  </s>
<s> And flags as to whether something should be checked also have problems, like criticality flags.  </s>
<s> The verifier has to know what needs to be checked for its application in most cases.  </s>
<s> If it can tell what flags to "mandate" verification are correct, then it doesn't need the flags.  </s>
<s> And the flag technique fails complete for cases where verifying any one, say, of the N things in a Manifest is adequate.  </s>
<s> Or where verifing a specific item in the Manifest which depends on other (possbily separatly/differently signed) parts of the message is adequate.  </s>
<s> By the way, going back to a single Manifest pointed to from SignedInfo is heading in the dirction of the Richard Brown proposal.  </s>
<s> I have an alternative proposal I will post as a separate message.  </s>
