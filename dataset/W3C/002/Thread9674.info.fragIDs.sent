<s> Is there an approved way to indicate the three parts of a literal in Ntriples?  </s>
<s> Or should we just take the line that while literals are defined to have three parts, we will proceed as though they were just strings, really?  </s>
<s> I would prefer it if we had a notation which did in fact exactly reflect our decisions, if only to be able to avoid having weasel-wording in the spec.  </s>
<s> For example, right now the MT is obliged to say something like this:  </s>
<s> "An RDF literal has three parts (a bit, a character string, and a language tag [@@reference@@]), but we will treat them simply as character strings, since the other parts of the literal play no role  </s>
<s> in the model theory."  </s>
<s> which is tacky, to say the least.  </s>
<s> BTW, what is the normative reference to go in there?  </s>

<s> Nowhere at present; we additionally don't define what a literal is, according to our decisiions.  </s>
<s> The existing MT talks about string literals (since we postponed XML stuff till later) and uses string equality.  </s>
<s> The answer is captured in the issues list from various minutes.  </s>
<s> I'll try to find the bits we decided.  </s>
<s> Issue http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xmllang (and Issue http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xmllang) say: a literal consists of three components: * A representation of the parseType, which is a single bit * A language indicator which is a string as defined in XML * A fully normalized UNICODE string.  </s>
<s> -- decided in http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020225-f2f/#d-2002-02-26-1 (Aside: although I see no response from the issue raiser, timbl) Issue http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces * the exact form of the string value corresponding to any given XML Literal within RDF/XML is implementation dependent.  </s>
<s> * the string value is well-balanced XML * taking the exclusive canonicalization of both the original XML Literal in its containing document, and the string value of the literal produce the same character string.  </s>
<s> (this will be used as the basis for test cases) * the canonicalization above is without comments i.e. CONFORMANCE should be tested by canonicalizing without comments; comments may be included in the string representation of a literal -- decided http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Mar/0235.html "Notes from I18N/RDFCore Meeting" * 18N agree that RDFCore requires a transitive string comparison algorithm and requests that the specs do not mislead application developers into thinking they are not permitted to implement a more flexible string matching algorithm, e.g. on queries.  </s>
<s> * I18N found the proposed solution of literals being a pair of a string and a language tag acceptable.  </s>
<s> Some discussion of the literal equality stuff proposed by John Cowan: Literals are equal iff: 1) the strings are equal, and 2a) at least one string does not have a tag, or 2b) one tag is a prefix of the other within the meaning of RFC 3066 (i.e. "fr"/French is not a prefix of "fry"/Frisian but is a prefix of "FR-CA"/Canadian French).  </s>
<s> -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0653.html but we backed off from the prefix stuff, allowing applications to be more permissive on matching language tags while letting RDF just use simple (case-independent) equality.  </s>
<s> Trying to summarise An RDF literal consists of three components: * [literal-value] A fully normalized Unicode string.  </s>
<s> * [literal-is-XML] A representation of the parseType, which is a single bit.  </s>
<s> If the bit is set, the [literal-value] must be interpreted as serialized XML rather a sequence of Unicode characters.  </s>
<s> * [literal-language] A language indicator string Constraints On [literal-language] * Any allowed xml:lang content as defined in For XML literals; that is, when [literal-is-XML] is set.  </s>
<s> * the exact form of [literal-value] corresponding to any given XML Literal within RDF/XML is implementation dependent.  </s>
<s> * [literal-value] is well-balanced XML * Taking the exclusive canonicalization of both the original XML Literal in its containing document, and [literal-value] produce the same character string.  </s>
<s> * The canonicalization above is without comments i.e. CONFORMANCE should be tested by canonicalizing without comments; comments may be included in [literal-value] Equality If [literal-is-XML] is set Two RDF literals are equal if and only if Taking the exclusive canonicalization of both [literal-value]s produce exactly the same sequence of Unicode characters.  </s>
<s> AND If either literal has an [literal-language] they must be present in both and identical strings (case independent comparison) otherwise Two RDF literals are equal if and only if Both [literal-value]s are identical AND If either literal has an [literal-language] they must be present in both and identical strings (case independent comparison) Implementors Note: It is recommended but not required that the case of [literal-language] is normalized to lowercase so that comparison is simple string equality.  </s>

<s> but as Pat said, the MT can consider literals opaque once the equality rules are clear.  </s>
<s> Dave PS The N-Triples literal stuff is designed that if you do a dumb US-ASCII compare of the characters, you get equality (as long as the language tags are lowercased)  </s>
