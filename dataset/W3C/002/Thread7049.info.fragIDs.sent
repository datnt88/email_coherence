<s> As you may know Microsoft is going to remove the userinfo from http URLs for Internet Explroer, so that URIs like: won't work anymore.  </s>
<s> While discussing that I and some others looked up what RFCs have to say about it and the result is quite confusing.  </s>
<s> Summary: 1738 says "not allowed": 3.3.  </s>
<s> HTTP: No user name or password is allowed  </s>
<s> URIs and not 1738 anymore 2616 refers to 2396 for http URIs  </s>
<s> 2396 says it merges/updates/revises/replaces 1738/1808 in respect to scheme-specific URIs.  </s>
<s> It doesn't list userinfo for http.  </s>
<s> So, is 1738 still relevant here?  </s>
<s> 2396bis doesn't list userinfo in the BNF syntax, but it's mentioned as an example.  </s>
<s> It's also deemed "not recommended" in general in most of the documents and looking thru some of the documents and discussions you can find under the various links at it seems like everyone thinks it's valid.  </s>
<s> Well, is it a valid http URI or not?  </s>
<s> Why is there so much confusion in the documents?  </s>
<s> Could you please add a definitive statement on userinfo in 2396bis and either add it explicitely to the BNF syntax or clearly state it's invalid?  </s>

<s> Only for the syntax constructs.  </s>
<s> The syntax for the http scheme is defined in 2616 and does not allow userinfo.  </s>
<s> 2396 defines the generic syntax for all schemes, some of which include userinfo as a valid option.  </s>
<s> It is not appropriate for it to say anything more than it already does, which is basically that it is not recommended for any scheme.  </s>
<s> Getting implementers to understand that passive user security is more important than backwards compatibility has proven to be difficult.  </s>
<s> The spec has to draw a fine line between describing how existing systems work and how they should work, particularly when the software  </s>
<s> is revised faster than the specifications.  </s>

<s> This prompted me to review the security considerations in: I think they cover this pretty well, but wonder if it's worth considering: (a) changing the section names for 7.4 and/or 7.5 to make it more obvious that they make reference to 'userinfo' parts of a URI.  </s>
<s> (b) adding some commentary to the effect that individual URI schemes may prohibit (are encouraged to prohibit?) the use of userinfo to ameliorate such security concerns.  </s>
<s> For example, update section 7.4 thus: 7.4 Sensitive Information in 'userinfo' component It is clearly unwise to use a URI that contains a password which is intended to be secret.  </s>
<s> In particular, the use of a password within the userinfo component of a URI is strongly discouraged except in those rare cases where the 'password' parameter is intended to be public.  </s>
<s> Because of the potential security concerns with the userinfo component (see also section 7.5 below), its use may be prohibited within some URI schemes that otherwise conform to this generic syntax.  </s>
<s> Such restriction is permitted and, where security concerns arise, encouraged.  </s>
<s> Consult the corresponding URI scheme specification for specific information about the fields allowed by various applications.  </s>

<s> Use of the format "user:password" in the userinfo field is deprecated.  </s>
<s> Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first colon (":") character found within a userinfo sub-component unless such data is the empty string (indicating no password) or "anonymous".  </s>

<s> But it's the userinfo which is "anonymous" not the  </s>

<s> Maybe rephrasing it to  </s>

<s> Kai Kai Schaetzl, Berlin, Germany  </s>
<s> I think that's exactly what it means--if the password is "anonymous" or "" then it may be shown.  </s>
<s> I don't know the rationale for this recommendation, but the intended meaning seems clear to me.  </s>
<s> If it appears ambiguous to some, maybe it should be rephrased to leave no room for doubt: Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first colon (":") character found within a userinfo sub-component unless the data after the colon is the string "anonymous" or the empty string (indicating no password).  </s>
