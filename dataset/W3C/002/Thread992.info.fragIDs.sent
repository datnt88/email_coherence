<s> Almost certainly not quite what you're after, but for HTML validation in any recent vim you can: vi my.html :compiler tidy :make Then jump/cycle through the errors/warnings as if they were compiler errors.  </s>
<s> Really depends what you're trying to achieve through the GUI.  </s>

<s> I'am searching a complete GUI Front end of HTML TIdy similar to http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyGUI/snap.gif, but for gnu/linux systems.  </s>
<s> That is; a GUI Front end that has all the functions de Tidy command line program in a nice graphic interface.  </s>
<s> By other side, her vim example didn't work me because to the following error message:  </s>
<s> Don't is a command of the vim editor: compiler tidy I use 6.0z alpha vim release in Mandrake Linux 8. Going to see if i can update it ;)  </s>
<s> Finally, sorry for my English, i speak Spanish Languaje and use a dictionary for translate her messaje ;).  </s>
