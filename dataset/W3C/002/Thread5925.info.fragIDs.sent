Assaf Here are two example choreographies with the same identical roles. 
The first does not allow cancelation of the order once it has been accepted. 
Choreography One BUYER SELLER 1. Order ---------- Either ... 2. ------------ Order Response ... or ... 3. ------------ Error Response The second does allow cancellation or chances after acceptance Choreography Two BUYER SELLER 1. Order ---------- Either ... 2. ------------ Order Response ... or ... 3. ------------ Error Response If Order Response received then, at Buyer's discretion, either ... 4. Change Order ---- 5. ------------ Change Order Response ... or ... 6. Cancel Order ---- 7. ------------ Cancel Order Response If Change Order Response received, and at Buyer's discretion then repeat from step 4. These choreographies are different but the roles (and often the messages) are identical.

[David Burdett] Not sure. 
For example if you design four different choreographies that are alternative ways of doing the same thing (e.g. placing an order), wouldn't the role stay the same? 
I need to see something more concrete here to understand what it means to stay the same role. 
What would make a role the same across two choreographies?

At most the relationship between choreographies will be akin to a type library that gets used in multiple progams. 
[David Burdett] Agreed. 
Martin.

RE: Requirements: Decisio n Po ints Requirement Proposals Assaf I always tend to think that one role can take part in multiple choreographies, for example a buyer could take part in: 1. 
Several different choreographies each of which resulted in the placement of an order 2. A separate order status choreography that could work with any of the different choreographies. 
I also recognize that the same choreography and roles could be invented multiple times. 
For example, the shoe industry could invent a choreography for placing orders that was identical to one developed by the wine industry but they give the choroegraphies different identifiers (URIs) for choreography itself and each of its roles. 
This is really a broader standardization issue that will only be solved when there is choreography instance standardization. 
For example the UBL initiative is developing standard representations and semantics for order documents using XML schema. 
We really need standard order placement choreographies to be developed using WS-Chor ... but we need WS-Chor first.

CHOREOGRAPHY RELATED 1. 
A role may take part in one or more choreographies For example a buyer there are several different ways of 
placing orders that 
involve different sequences of messages. 
However the basic 
role stays the 
same. 
That depends on how you define a role. 
You can define a role as being a component of the choreography in which case a role participants in one choreography. 
That does not restrict an entity from being multiple roles in multiple choreographies. 
You can define roles that participate in any number of choreographies, but I'm not sure what it buys you, and if you're having problems reaching agreements you probably would have a problem agreeing to use the same role in multiple choreographies. 
(Again, won't restrict the same entity ...) I accept that as a party intending to buy products I would assume the role 'buyer' in one choreography, 'procurer' in another, and 'sucker' in a third one. 
On the other hand, I may be expected to operate in the same way in all three choreographies, i.e. implement the same interface, but that brings us back to the role=interface equality, mobile process model and all other undesirable solutions. 
4. A choreography specifies the sequence, conditions and 
dependencies of 
sending one or more messages This is really the core of what choreographies are all about. 
The only 
question I would have is whether this is compatible with the 
ideas of 
pi-calculus, and if it isn't does it matter? 
Yes it does. 
And if it doesn't then pi-calculus wouldn't be relevent to our work.

I assume what you mean by same role is not the fact that both 
choreographies choose to call it 'buyer', but the fact that in both of them the buyer would be able to act in the same way against the seller. 
Am I correct? 
In that case, would it make more sense to define the buyer's participant 
and then create two choreographies using that reusable definition?

I really mean that a buyer can act in *different* ways with a seller, i.e. different choreographies, for the same purpose, e.g. placing an order. 
and then create two choreographies using that reusable definition? 
I'm not sure what you mean by buyer's participant. 
I really think that you need to define the roles and then identify the role being taken by a participant in an instance of a choreography. 
Does the following agree with your thinking? 
1. 
A participant (or party) is an organization or business that suppports one or more choreographies (e.g. for different ways of doing business with partners) 2. A party can take many roles, e.g buyer, seller, etc 3. A role can be taken by many parties, e.g many businesses can be a buyer 4. Choreography definitions are designed to meet some useful "purpose" (e.g. place an order) 5. 
More than one choreography can exist that meets the same "purpose", e.g. there is more than one choreography for placing an order 6. 
A choreography involves two or more roles, e.g. a buyer, seller, etc 7. The roles are depend on the "purpose" of the choreography rather than the individual choreography. 
e.g. you always have a buyer and a seller when placing an order irrespective of the actual choreography being used. 
8. Therefore the same roles may be used by more than one choreography. 
Thoughts?

accepted. 
Unless a role materialises as a concrete thing (say with a wsdl interafce and some predefined operations), then I am not sure what it means to say a role may be used by more than choreogarphy, aside from the syntactic name being the same. 
Martin. 
When I build a system to participate in a choreography what role it takes has no meaning to me unless the role also says what it should do or expect other participants to do. 
Essentially, I need a definition of its commitments. 
If the commitments are similar across two choreographies then that system can participate in both of these choreographies. 
If the commitments are widely different but they so happen to have the same name, it really doesn't help the system participate in more than one choreography. 
So again, it boils down to: is the role just a fancy name, or is there more information associated with that role, and in this case, can we define that information specific for the role and use it to define any number of choreographies?
