<s> CHOREOGRAPHY RELATED 1.  </s>
<s> A role may take part in one or more choreographies For example a buyer there are several different ways of  </s>
<s> placing orders that  </s>
<s> involve different sequences of messages.  </s>
<s> However the basic  </s>
<s> role stays the  </s>
<s> same.  </s>
<s> That depends on how you define a role.  </s>
<s> You can define a role as being a component of the choreography in which case a role participants in one choreography.  </s>
<s> That does not restrict an entity from being multiple roles in multiple choreographies.  </s>
<s> You can define roles that participate in any number of choreographies, but I'm not sure what it buys you, and if you're having problems reaching agreements you probably would have a problem agreeing to use the same role in multiple choreographies.  </s>
<s> (Again, won't restrict the same entity ...) I accept that as a party intending to buy products I would assume the role 'buyer' in one choreography, 'procurer' in another, and 'sucker' in a third one.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I may be expected to operate in the same way in all three choreographies, i.e. implement the same interface, but that brings us back to the role=interface equality, mobile process model and all other undesirable solutions.  </s>
<s> 4. A choreography specifies the sequence, conditions and  </s>
<s> dependencies of  </s>
<s> sending one or more messages This is really the core of what choreographies are all about.  </s>
<s> The only  </s>
<s> question I would have is whether this is compatible with the  </s>
<s> ideas of  </s>
<s> pi-calculus, and if it isn't does it matter?  </s>
<s> Yes it does.  </s>
<s> And if it doesn't then pi-calculus wouldn't be relevent to our work.  </s>

<s> Assaf said ...  </s>
<s> choreographies choose to call it 'buyer', but the fact that in both of them the buyer would be able to act in the same way against the seller.  </s>
<s> I really mean that a buyer can act in *different* ways with a seller, i.e. different choreographies, for the same purpose, e.g. placing an order.  </s>
<s> and then create two choreographies using that reusable definition?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you mean by buyer's participant.  </s>
<s> I really think that you need to define the roles and then identify the role being taken by a participant in an instance of a choreography.  </s>
<s> Does the following agree with your thinking?  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> A participant (or party) is an organization or business that suppports one or more choreographies (e.g. for different ways of doing business with partners) 2. A party can take many roles, e.g buyer, seller, etc 3. A role can be taken by many parties, e.g many businesses can be a buyer 4. Choreography definitions are designed to meet some useful "purpose" (e.g. place an order) 5.  </s>
<s> More than one choreography can exist that meets the same "purpose", e.g. there is more than one choreography for placing an order 6.  </s>
<s> A choreography involves two or more roles, e.g. a buyer, seller, etc 7. The roles are depend on the "purpose" of the choreography rather than the individual choreography.  </s>
<s> e.g. you always have a buyer and a seller when placing an order irrespective of the actual choreography being used.  </s>
<s> 8. Therefore the same roles may be used by more than one choreography.  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>

<s> accepted.  </s>
<s> Unless a role materialises as a concrete thing (say with a wsdl interafce and some predefined operations), then I am not sure what it means to say a role may be used by more than choreogarphy, aside from the syntactic name being the same.  </s>
<s> Martin.  </s>
<s> When I build a system to participate in a choreography what role it takes has no meaning to me unless the role also says what it should do or expect other participants to do.  </s>
<s> Essentially, I need a definition of its commitments.  </s>
<s> If the commitments are similar across two choreographies then that system can participate in both of these choreographies.  </s>
<s> If the commitments are widely different but they so happen to have the same name, it really doesn't help the system participate in more than one choreography.  </s>
<s> So again, it boils down to: is the role just a fancy name, or is there more information associated with that role, and in this case, can we define that information specific for the role and use it to define any number of choreographies?  </s>
