<s> There a couple of talks on structured document management at XML/MT '99 (www.gca.org/attend/1999_conferences/xml_99/default.htm), including one which specifically mentions WebDAV (abstract below).  </s>
<s> WebDAV seems like a natural fit for this application with its support for hierarchical collections.  </s>
<s> My personal interest is an XML browser/editor which can edit in place objects within a document (vs. the whole document) using WebDAV.  </s>
<s> Is anyone working on this?  </s>
<s> If anyone is planning to attend in Philadelphia and would like to get together informally to discuss current WebDAV-related initiatives, please send me e-mail and I'll help coordinate a time and place.  </s>

<s> Approaches for structured document management Timothy Arnold-Moore, Michael Fuller, and Ron Sacks-Davis, Royal Melbourne  </s>
<s> Institute of Technology (Australia) Document Management Systems (DMS) are tools to manage centralized repositories of documents, providing controlled access to documents and tracking the changes made to the documents.  </s>
<s> This presentation compares traditional DMS functionality with more recent DMS functional extensions and the even greater functionality available with structured document support through SGML or XML, and then summarizes the architectural differences among the three approaches.  </s>
<s> It also discusses relevant standards and initiatives, including ODMA, WEBDAV, and WAPI.  </s>
<s> I think you missed one of the talks at XML '99 :-) ... WebDAV: Web-Based Distributed Authoring and Versioning  </s>
<s> WebDAV is an exciting new technology for the World Wide Web.  </s>
<s> WebDAV stands for Web-Based Distributed Authoring and Versioning, and provides a way to remotely author and manage your web servers (whether you are an author or an adminstrator).  </s>
<s> The WebDAV protocol is specified by RFC 2518 as an extension to the HTTP protocol, utilizing XML for client/server interactions and communication of metadata.  </s>
<s> This talk will present an overview of WebDAV, its benefits for users, and scenarios for effective deployment.  </s>
<s> It will continue with a discussion of the available tools, applications, and programmatic APIs available for working in WebDAV-enabled environments.  </s>
<s> In closing, the session will detail the future direction of the WebDAV protocol and how it could drive the next step in the evolution of the Web. by Greg Stein, Independent Software Developer (Wednesday, 9:45am) You might surmise that I'll be there, too :-).  </s>
<s> Yes, I'd be interested in getting together.  </s>
<s> It might make sense to put something on webdav.org.  </s>
<s> Should I direct people at you, for setting up a BOF?  </s>
<s> Re: editor.  </s>
<s> WebDAV provides no specific facilities for editing pieces of a document.  </s>
<s> Standard HTTP can do a GET/PUT using ranges, but WebDAV has avoided things like range locks.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g  </s>
<s> Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> I just wanted to say that I think a BOF is a great idea.  </s>
<s> Even though I won't be attending XML'99, if I were there, I'd certainly want to get together with Greg, David, and other DAV folk.  </s>
<s> I'd also definitely attend Greg's talk.  </s>
