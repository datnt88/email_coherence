This addresses ACTION 2001-08-24#3 DaveB: Get syntax draft updated. 
RDF/XML Syntax - RDF Core WG Internal Working Draft V1.23 
I have expanded the introduction, tidied up the document and 
reformatted and did some more tidying of the infoset grammar section 
This is as much as I can do in the time available to allow review it for Friday.

4.4 Production description (was 6.3 description) element([namespace name]=rdf-ns, [local name]="Description", [attributes]=set(idAboutAttr?, bagIdAttr?, propertyAttr*), [children]=list()) | element([namespace name]=rdf-ns, [local name]="Description", [attributes]=set(idAboutAttr?, bagIdAttr?, propertyAttr*), [children]=list(propertyElt+)) 
I was wondering if there was any difference by saying element([namespace name]=rdf-ns, [local name]="Description", [attributes]=set(idAboutAttr?, bagIdAttr?, propertyAttr*), [children]=list(*)) and the same for 4.5 and 4.6 
I actually expanded that from the more compact form and the reason for that is twofold. 
Firstly, empty elements in XML use a different form than elements with content and having this explict makes it clear which one are talking about. 
From an implementation point of view, the empty/non-empty cases are an important distinction. 
Secondly, we can use the answers from the empty-elements decisions that Jan wrote for property elements, to directly write down the answers to what statements are generated from the grammar: but maybe in the next version

For production 6.1 you write that RDF can be: 
rdf:RDF " description* " /rdf:RDF " | description 
This is a pretty big change, since M&amp;S never allowed RDF documents without their surrounding rdf:RDF tags. 
I don't believe the Working Group ever made a decision on this issue. 
I'm not certain that I disagree with it, but I feel it's important for the WG to be aware of the issue.

Hi Dave, [you must have been working very hard!]

Very nice work Dave! 
Just a couple of comments. 
With the explicit removal of container support, the syntax is obviously simpler and the issues rdf-containers-syntax- {ambiguity,vs-schema} are addressed. 
I wonder, however, if this neat trick will create more confusion. 
Since the prose in M&amp;S 1.0 implies that values for parseType other than Literal and Resource are allowed, perhaps 4.6 should accomodate that case (e.g. parseType="daml:Collection"). 
Art P.S. A nit - missing ')' at the end of the third option of 4.6. 
I'm looking at $Revision: 1.24 $ $Date: 2001/08/28 15:04:46 $ The added/removed distinction doesn't show up with stylesheets turned off. 
It's fine to use stylesheets to make a nice style, but please check that essential distinctions are visible without the stylesheet. 
Hmm... I was going to say that it's not critical for this first release, but evidently it is: 2.The document must conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, Level A. Use the WCAG 1.0 Checklist (5 May 1999 version). 
-- http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules 2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
6.1 Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets.

Hi Dave, Excellent work. 
I've only a few comments: 
Status section, near end Comments on this document are invited and should be sent to the public mailing list www-rdf-comments@w3.org or to the RDF Core Working Group. 
suggest delete 'or to the RDF Core Working Group' - rdf-comments is the right channel. 
Section 1 para 2 The RDF Core Working Group was chartered to revise RDF in light of this implementor feedback, addressing these issues, making decisions on ambiguous cases, changes where necessary, and to record these as potential errata for the original document. 
These changes have to be checked with the developer community as to their affect on existing implementations and documents. 
Lets stick closer to the actual wording in the charter, e.g. 
The RDFCore WG is chartered to respond to the need for a number of fixes, clarifications and improvements to the specification of RDF's abstract model and XML syntax. 
The WG wishes feedback from the developer community of the effects of its proposals on existing implementations and documents. 
4.1, table rows 2&amp;3 element([prop1]=value1, [prop1]=value2, ...) prop2? 
4.8 Sorry, don't know my infoset well enough. 
Does defining an attibute to take a value of type ID have a similar effect as DTD ID's? 
e.g. only one per element. 
Does it have implications for what the ID denotes e.g. something in this document. 
4.12 Grammar is ambiguous since both productions match a typeAttr. 
Statement somewhere (4.1?) that if a production matches an 'any' or something more specific, the more specific production applies. 
Also affects 4.4 and 4.5. 
Appendix A Does this document reference n-triples, schema primer, schema datatypes? 
Nits: Ignorable. 
Section 1 para 1 RDF Model &amp; Syntax used an EBNF form plus explanatory text to define and explain the XML syntax. 
change to 'explain the RDF/XML syntax'. 
Section 1 para 4 spelling 'resulting' Section 1 para 4 'in terms of XML characters'. 
delete XML. 
Section 3 para 1 delete 'that endorse the changes from the issues list.' Brian 
I agree; excellent work (reads fine in IE5 anyway!). 
I only have one concern, and that is that the title seems inconsistent with the contents. 
Mind you, I like (and we need) those contents, but the title leads me to expect a self-contained document describing the RDF/XML Syntax. 
That's what I expect we will publish under this title. 
What we have is a document that describes the process by which we're evolving the syntax, which needs to be used together with the M&amp;S to really understand the changes we're in the process of making. 
I'm a little concerned that if the world hears we're publishing a new "RDF/XML Syntax WD", this won't be what they'll expect to get.

and 
attribute([namespace name]=rdf-ns, [local name]="bagID", [attribute type]=ID) 
Does it say that the type of these attributes must be ID? If so, RDF/XML document without DTD cannot use ID and bagID attribute because they become CDATA. 
And a RDF/XML parser may produce different results wheter it reads an external dtd subset or not.
