Dean, See "Uniform Resource Identifiers for Television Broadcasts" 
"Jerding, Dean" a x rit : Where is the latest specification for the "tv:" scheme? 
I'm new to this list, so apologize if this is documented elsewhere. 
What I have seen on w3 was just a draft of a proposal with some unfinished areas such as tying in to ATSC, DVB, etc SI specifications. 
Scientific-Atlanta is using our own version of a "tv:" like URL scheme so we'd like to contribute to the specification and abide by the standard.

(was: Re: "lid" URLs) Dan, i think that at least the "tv:" scheme seems to be ready to be forwarded to the IESG for adoption - what do you think ? 
There was not much discussion last time you did an update, so maybe it's time to wrap this up. 
-Philipp Dan Zigmond a x rit : 
Agreed. 
We were a little careless in our terminology (as others 
also 
pointed out), and I just haven't gotten around to revising the 
drafts.

I've just noticed a couple of Internet drafts that propose and

URI scheme called lid: draft-blackketter-lid-00.txt draft-finseth-isanlid-00.txt 
I have two thoughts: (a) these lid:'s look more like URNs to me (b) the lid draft claims that lid:'s are simulatneously URIs and 
URNs, but 
they don't conform to URN syntax (in not having a leading "urn:" 
or 
namespace identifier parts). 
I don't have a problem with URL-schemes that have URN-like 
semantics, 
since there are enough of them already (cid, news, etc.). 
I think 
the 
wording (saying that lid URLs are URNs) probably needs to change, 
since 
it just adds confusion.
