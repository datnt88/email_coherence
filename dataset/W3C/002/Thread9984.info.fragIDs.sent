Sigh, I didnt get much time free today. 
The Lbase appendix is in better shape and Ive rewritten a few paragraphs in the datatyping section. 
It still needs a lot of editing work (references, boilerplate, CSS pruning and HTML cleanup) , but it would OK to 
snapshot this now for content review.

Sigh, me neither (off sick...) but I think I can have a shippable RDFS out tonight or tommorrow. 
Apologies for the delay.

Thanks Pat. 
Lets get this out there. 
My advice, we don't need Lbase. 
You can't even refer to it at present and I don't want getting the lbase note published as a dependency. 
Danbri has that action and he is clearly not well. 
Its the technical meat of the MT we need. 
The finer points of editing can wait, though html cleanup cannot.

Poor Danbri. 
First toothache then sick. 
Don't overdo things. 
Just send us what you've got so far. 
I'll finish of this draft (or find someone to do it.) I should have done this earlier instead of leaving you to struggle on. 
Sorry. 
Brian 
Per your suggest Pat, I've copied a snapshot to the archive: You might like to base further work on this version as I've cleaned up the html to the point where it validates.
