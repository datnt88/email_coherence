<s> I can still do a GET on each server and the result will be from the same resource but only one of the servers will be able to serve up the dav:bindings property.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately the language in section 11 speaks of the dav:bindings property being on a resource so the presumption is that if I can get the dav:bindings property through one binding then I MUST be able to get it through the other.  </s>
<s> I believe this is too strict a requirement.  </s>
<s> As such I move that the language in section 11 be clarified so as to specify that the dav:bindings property may not necessarily be available through all bindings on the resource.  </s>
<s> This seems right to me.  </s>
<s> It also points out that till now we've been thinking that capabilities vary by resource, so that responses to OPTIONS vary by resource.  </s>
<s> When we consider situations where there are multiple bindings to the same resource, it turns out that capabilities really vary by URI, and responses to OPTIONS with different request-URI but the same resource may be different.  </s>
<s> So we need also to take another look at the wording of section 15 Capability Discovery, as well as 9 (which you discuss in another note).  </s>

<s> One possiblity is to say that "all dead properties of a resource must be available from all bindings to that resource".  </s>
<s> This acknowledges that the behavior of live properties can be "special", including acting differently at different bindings to that resource.  </s>

<s> One of the big mistakes WebDAV, in my opinion, made was differentiating between live and dead properties.  </s>
<s> I think this is a meaningless differentiation.  </s>
<s> For example, one can take any property, declare it "alive" and instantly get around the requirement that dead properties be available everywhere.  </s>
<s> "Maul, I have you now, that is a dead property and therefore must be available through all bindings!" "I see you are weak in the ways of WebDAV Qui-Gon, my server is enhanced so that all properties are treated as alive, therefore I do not have to make them all available through all bindings!" "But Maul, No! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...." (or whatever sound one makes when a light saber is thrust through one's chest) Yaron  </s>
