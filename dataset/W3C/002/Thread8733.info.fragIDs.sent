<s> Brian, Sorry for the confusion.? I misspoke in my email.? I meant KeyValue, not KeyInfo.? KeyInfo is very valuable.? KeyValue is a specific form of KeyInfo.?

<s> --Barb -----Original Message----- Barb, If the intent is to leave out issues related to trust management then I suggest my proposal that no KeyInfo element be required is the best solution.  </s>
<s> A digital signature specification that chooses to leave out trust management issues is bound to have interoperability issues in that domain.  </s>
<s> Attempting to find a common ground for interoperability without addressing trust management is a tall order, and I contend that KeyValue only complicates the issue for implementers.  </s>
<s> Consider an implementation that is deployed in a PKI-enabled environment, a likely scenario.  </s>
<s> Why force it to deal with KeyValue-related trust issues out-of-band, or otherwise, when such issues can be dealt with cleanly using some combination of the X509Data elements?  </s>
<s> There are plenty of places in the spec where application-specific content can hinder interoperability, perhaps this should be another one.  </s>
<s> As for DSA parameters, there is no trust management architecture in which DSA parameters used to validate a signature should be extracted from the message they will be used to verify.  </s>
<s> As such, they need never be present in the message and users can be spared passing around thousands of needless bits by requiring their absence.  </s>
<s> - Carl ----- Original Message ----- Carl: In response to your first issue: Do not assume that because an application includes a KeyValue as KeyInfo that the recipient does not have some a prior validation for that key.  </s>
<s> Unlike PKIX, we explicitly chose to leave trust managment mechanisms out of this standard, and we selected KeyValue as the MUST implement option to assure basic interoperability.  </s>
<s> I believe that presumption of a trust model (as in values passed must be trusted) is also the basis of your second issue.  </s>
<s> Barbara Fox Microsoft -----Original Message----- 1) Why require support for unprotected, unvalidated keys?  </s>
<s> It seems a little strange to make KeyInfo OPTIONAL to accommodate applications that, for whatever reason, do not wish to disclose KeyInfo then to mandate that applications wishing to use some form of KeyInfo provide support for what may be the weakest option.  </s>
<s> Perhaps no KeyInfo option should be required.  </s>
<s> 2) DSA support is required.  </s>
<s> Where the KeyValue element is used to identify a DSA key the presence of parameters is required (see section 6.4.1).  </s>
<s> The DSA parameter problem present in X.509 described by Santosh Chokhani (see http://www.cygnacom.com/downloads/dsaflaw.zip ) is also a problem here.  </s>
<s> Parameters found in KeyValue cannot be trusted, should not be used and thus need not be included.  </s>
<s> The requirement that parameters must be included should be replaced with a requirement that parameters must be absent and be obtained from a trusted source.  </s>
<s> 3) Section 4.4 states that "applications may define and use any (KeyInfo) mechanism they choose through inclusion of elements from a different namespace."  </s>
<s> This doesn't appear to be possible given the current DTD and schema definitions.  </s>

<s> Barb, Thanks to Brian's comments I understand now the idea is for KeyInfo to serve as a "hint" and little/nothing more.  </s>
<s> However, I still fail to see where KeyValue provides anything in the way of "base interoperability" where a PKI application receives a key via KeyValue from a non-PKI application and thus fail to see why KeyValue is required.  </s>
<s> It seems only to provide enough interoperability for a non-PKI application to deliver a key that cannot be validated to a PKI application.  </s>
<s> Without clarification in the text as to the intent, I believe the structures provide too much of an invitation to be used in a manner not consistent with the intent.  </s>
<s> As for the DSA parameters, since using them directly from a KeyValue is not the idea, why mandate their inclusion?  </s>
<s> Certainly there would be no harm in relaxing the requirement that every KeyValue include them; a simple minOccurs=0 seems appropriate.  </s>
<s> It would definitely save many bits spent on information that's really more nice to have than necessary for many/most implementations.  </s>
<s> -Carl  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the issue here is not so much a burden on developers, but rather a question of NEED vs. WANT.  </s>
<s> From the xmldsig-requirements document section 2.5: "The specification must only require the provision of key information essential to checking the validity of the cryptographic signature.  </s>
<s> For instance, identity and key recovery information might be of interest to particular applications, but they are not within the class of required information defined in this specification.  </s>
<s> [List(Reagle)] " This information is not "essential".  </s>
<s> It may be nice to have during path development, but you can perform path development without this information as well..  </s>
<s> The issue to me is not that the standard provides a mechanism to encode key information in this field, but that it REQUIRES it.  </s>
<s> DSA key and parameter information is not required to perform path development, it only assists in path development.  </s>
