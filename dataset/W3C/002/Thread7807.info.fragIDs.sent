<s> If a server uses your recommended oredering for the propstat XML element and sends the status first, then starts streaming data out of its property store, and then detects an error ... there's no way to put that error into the response, since you've already sent the status, right?  </s>
<s> Assuming the server isn't streaming the data out doesn't work either -- if the server reads the entire property out before marshalling the response, then it can detect ahead of time that there was an error, and just not send any information at all for the property, thereby avoiding the case that motivates the ordering change in propstat.  </s>
