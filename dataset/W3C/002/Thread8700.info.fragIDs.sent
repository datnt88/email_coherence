<s> Attribute-Value Normalization Before the value of an attribute is passed to the application or checked for validity, the XML processor must normalize it as follows: -- a character reference is processed by appending the referenced character to the attribute value -- an entity reference is processed by recursively processing the replacement text of the entity -- a whitespace character (#x20, #xD, #xA, #x9) is processed by appending #x20 to the normalized value, except that only a single #x20 is appended for a "#xD#xA" sequence that is part of an external parsed entity or the literal entity value of an internal parsed entity --other characters are processed by appending them to the normalized value If the declared value is not CDATA, then the XML processor must further process the normalized attribute value by discarding any leading and trailing space (#x20) characters, and by replacing sequences of space (#x20) characters by a single space (#x20) character.  </s>

<s> "--a character reference is processed by appending the referenced character to the attribute value" if you had &amp;#xD; in an attribute value of your inital document, then the processor would have dereferenced the character to #xD so when you serialize it, you have a #xD character in atribute value.  </s>

<s> Hi Kevin, Good question.  </s>
<s> #xD, #xA and #x9 can appear in a normalized attribute value if they were created by character references.  </s>
<s> This would not appear to be the case from the XML 1.0 spec (specifically the passage you cited), but please see the XML errata [1,2].  </s>
