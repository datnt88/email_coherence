<s> Depends on what you mean by "has the right to list the collection but not its members".  </s>
<s> If the client does not have the right to even see the names of the members, then the collection should just look empty, since the client should not be able to even know it has members.  </s>
<s> If the client has the right to see the name of members but not to see the properties of members, then listing their names with the Forbidden status seems reasonable to me.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff members I think we have identified something that needs to be clarified in RFC2518: Given a collection X, where the principal does have rights to list the collection itself, but not it's members.  </s>
<s> Currently our server will distinguish between depth 0 and 1, that is a  </s>
<s> PROPFIND with depth 0 will report the collection (and it's properties) OK, while a PROPFIND with depth 1 will result in something like: This is because once a response element for X is available, there's no other way to distinguish between the case where the collection actually is empty, or the collection is non-empty, but the principal doesn't have the right to list it's members.  </s>

<s> When security is so tight that people aren't allowed to even know about the existence or non-existence of members, these cases (a collection that's empty versus one that contains members "invisible to you") aren't supposed to be distinguishable.  </s>
<s> To see this, consider the case where a collection has some visible and some invisible members (from a particular user's point of view): just the visible members should be listed.  </s>
<s> But I think there's an entirely different spec issue here: whether or not DAV collections can hide the existence of members at all.  </s>
<s> Section 8.1 on PROPFIND says:  </s>
<s> Consequently, the multistatus XML element for a collection resource with member URIs MUST include a response XML element for each member URI of the collection, to whatever depth was requested.  </s>
<s> Each response XML element MUST contain an href XML element that gives the URI of the resource on which the properties in the prop XML element are defined.  </s>
<s> This seems to require you either: a. to list the members and then say 403 for any properties, or  </s>
<s> b. to return 403 for any PROPFIND with depth  0 on the containing collection.  </s>
<s> Note that neither of these options meets the security requirements of "a user must not be able to determine whether or not a collection has a given member," but I don't think that 2518 intended to make it illegal for servers to enforce this kind of security.  </s>
<s> So I think there is a spec issue here.  </s>
