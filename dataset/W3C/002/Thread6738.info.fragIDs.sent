<s> some thoughts about xmlspec and docbook...  </s>
<s> I attended an event in Washington last week on XML publishing format to present how we use XML in the W3C DOM WG. Seems that some organizations are interested in using the same XML Schema (or whatever you like as a schema).  </s>
<s> OASIS is leading towards the XML version of DocBook.  </s>
<s> The W3C started to use xmlspec in 1996/1997 with the XML specification itself.  </s>
<s> I didn't look closely at DocBook and I'm still wondering how far we go into producing a common schema for specifications, but is there any chance that we can merge both somehow (or use a correct extension mechanism)?  </s>
<s> Benefits are not obvious between organizations since the documents format  </s>
<s> are differents but for applications who would like to be able to use our XML documents, it would improve a lot their situation (I'm thinking about NIST in particular here).  </s>
<s> Given that some people on this list are both in W3C and OASIS, maintaining both formats, how huge is the gap between xmlspec and docbook?  </s>
<s> I'm personnally not favoring xmlspec or docbook.  </s>
<s> Using an XML format is a sufficient reason for me as long as I can describe well enough the DOM specifications (i.e. an XML format without support for interface would be useless).  </s>

<s> Considering article in DocBook to be roughly equivalent to spec , I arrive at the following comparison (off the top of my head): DocBook Articles vs. XMLSpec - The "meta" is quite different, XMLSpec has a whole bunch of W3C-specific metadata.  </s>
<s> This could (should?) be addressed by creating an XML namespace for the W3C metadata.  </s>
<s> The DocBook TC is evaluating what to do with meta and allowing namespaced meta seems like a good idea.  </s>
<s> - XMLSpec tag names are often HTML-derived so they tend to be shorter.  </s>
<s> (e.g. p vs. para , att vs. sgmltag class='attribute' .)  </s>
<s> - DocBook probably has more "wrappers".  </s>
<s> - DocBook uses the CALS table model, XMLSpec uses HTML.  </s>
<s> (But they aren't that far apart, really.)  </s>
<s> - XMLSpec has more "special purpose" elements (e.g., specref/ , bibref/ , etc. where DocBook has just xref/ ).  </s>
<s> I think working towards some common format would be a really good idea.  </s>
<s> Q1: Are we willing to break legacy in significant ways?  </s>
<s> Could the XMLSpec doctype be made more DocBook-like and vice versa?  </s>
<s> Q2: Assuming that neither community is willing to accept all the suggestions of the other :-), should we define an isomorphic set of tags?  </s>
<s> Q3: Can this be addressed organizationally?  </s>
<s> Could the W3C be persuaded to accept DocBook documents as specs?  </s>
<s> Could OASIS be persuaded to accept XMLSpec?  </s>
<s> Adding markup to DocBook, if there are justifiable use cases in the computer documentation domain, is pretty straightforward.  </s>

<s> Passmore  </s>
<s> I would say that's the job of the editor so we should not let us stopped by this issue.  </s>
<s> I would suggest to keep the XMLspec format here (and in general to always prefer the "special purpose" elements over a general element).  </s>
<s> I don't know about the XSL but the DOM generator is doing different manipulation depending on the element (specref, xspecref or bibref).  </s>
<s> This will force the DOM working group to revise its DOM generator and the XSL for the DOM Test Suites but it is possible to do it.  </s>
<s> I'm waiting for more feedback before asking the group directly.  </s>
<s> As Dan pointed out, the W3C has no constraint on tools used to produce as long as the resulting document HTML valid and conforms to the W3C style.  </s>
<s> I don't think that all working groups are ready to switch to XML yet unfortunately.  </s>
<s> We will need to ask/persuade the working groups who are currently using xmlspec to switch to the new format.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>

<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> I tend to favor the other approach myself, allowing the link behavior to be determined by the thing it points to.  </s>
<s> But I don't feel very strongly about it.  </s>
<s> Yes, we definitely need more feedback.  </s>
<s> It's too early to start changing things :-)  </s>
<s> That will probably be easier than persuading the working groups not currently using XML at all to start using it :-) Be seeing you, norm Norman.Walsh@Sun.COM | If you're strong enough, there *are* no XML Standards Engineer | precedents.--Scott  </s>

<s> This isn't practical in the general case.  </s>
<s> For example, how would you be able to tell, by looking at the thing linked to, that a reference to another W3C specification is normative vs. non-normative?  </s>
<s> I realize that XMLspec currently doesn't make this distinction, but it's something that has been brought up a few times.  </s>
<s> The association may have semantics that neither of the endpoints has on its own.  </s>

<s> Right -- either RDF, or XLink arc roles that are harvestable as RDF if you wish... My point was that you can't tell by inspection what the semantic is; a human has to decide and record it.  </s>

<s> Well, that may be true in the general case, but an xref to a bibl is probably a bibref and an xref to a div is probably a specref, etc.  </s>

<s> This is all a bit theoretical at the moment, and depends on editorial style and available markup.  </s>
<s> Arc roles are more flexible precisely because you don't have to keep inventing new elements, and yet they give you lots of expressiveness.  </s>
<s> (But both allow a human to make and apply a judgment, which a raw ref element doesn't give you.) E.g., the current style is to use bibrefs to link to bibls, but there's been some talk about also/instead linking directly to the cited work.  </s>
<s> If we adopted a style where you link directly to the other document, and you wanted to indicate whether the other document is normatively or non-normatively cited, you could use an arc role to indicate this.  </s>
<s> In fact, using XLink extended links, you could handily link the citation both to the bibliography entry and to the external document.  </s>
