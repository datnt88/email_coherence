At our IETF working group meeting, a number of people pressed us to add security issues to the WEBDAV requirements document. 
There was a lot of concern that we are greatly expanding the opportunities for attack, but saying nothing about security. 
There was a sense that we need to say something about three separate areas: Authentication Access Control Interoperability with existing security protocols I took an action to start conversations on the mailing list on these topics, so let me do that. 
Authentication: WEBDAV should support Basic and Digest Authentication, just as HTTP 1.1 does. 
Anything beyond this? 
Access Control: WEBDAV should provide a way for authors to specify access control for resources that they create, within bounds set by the server administrator. 
A WEBDAV server should at a minimum be able to use the access control mechanisms provided by the operating system. 
It should also allow repositories standing behind it to use their own access control mechanisms. 
Interoperability with existing security protocols: WEBDAV should be able to interoperate with (which protocols?) to protect both client and server from attacks on their data, running applications, operating systems, and hardware; and to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit. 
What's different about WEBDAV that it should lead to more serious or different security problems than HTTP? 
We're encouraging people to publish via WEBDAV, and to publish work-in-progress. 
We're giving people new tools for organizing materials on the Web. 
Links are probably the most fundamental new factor we are introducing. 
Can we (should we) provide a means to limit who can link objects together? 
Who can put a link or any other metadata on a resource? 
Who can put a resource into a collection? 
If a resource belongs to several collections with different access control rules, which ones apply?

Well, just to calibrate: I think from a user point of view, being able to say "this is public" or "this is private" for a new document the user has stored is far more important for DAV than being able to do "MOVE" or "COPY". 
Do you agree? 
A good question. 
At the risk of sounding evasive, I'd have to say "It depends". 
There are several scenarios I'm concerned about where the user will probably never want explicitly to alter access permissions on a document. 
For example, there are small departmental web servers where everything is always public to people in the department. 
Or there are situations where you have a private directory on a server, accessible only to you, where you author documents. 
When the document is finished you COPY it to a public area. 
In these scenarios MOVE and COPY are more important than the ability to specify public/private. 
On the other hand, I agree that there are scenarios where the ability to specify public/private is really important. 
There are also scenarios where the ability to specify cache-control information is more important than either security or MOVE/COPY. 
And there are also situations where it's crucial that the user be able to say "Return this document if the requester supports frames, return this document if it doesn't." 
To me all of these situations are just variants on managing and administering a web server. 
That's why I'm reluctant to address security - I'm afraid it's the first step down a slippery slope.

To me all of these situations are just variants on managing and administering a web server. 
This, IMHO, is the crux of the issue. 
It's a matter of proper balance between these needs in any given context.
