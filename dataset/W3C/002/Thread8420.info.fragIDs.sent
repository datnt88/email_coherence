<s> Hi, Maybe my reading of RFC 2518 is not thorough enough.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that: XML elements are allowed in a copy method to modify the copying behavior.  </s>
<s> But, what kind of XML elements are allowed and how should they be interpreted?  </s>
<s> Thx, -Stanley  </s>
<s> You are correct, but this functionality hasn't been widely implemented.  </s>
<s> It turns out the server knows more about what properties can and should be kept live on a COPY operation, so the clients never provided this information and servers didn't need it anyway.  </s>
<s> In RFC2518bis this has been removed.  </s>
