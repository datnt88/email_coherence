Sergey's S-A and S-B are indeed very interesting e.g. :Karel :age "13" . 
# S-B and :Karel :ageInYears [ xsd:decimal "13" ] . 
# S-A are like 2 paths between :Karel and "13" and I think one can cope easily with that via :age ont:samePropertyAs ( :ageInYears xsd:decimal ) . 
and all of this is just N-Triples. 
The rules for ont:samePropertyAs are generic and allow us to entail the same stuff from different descriptions.

Does ont:samePropertyAs in DAML ONT allow path expressions like the one you suggested above?

I would think (and hope) so, but I'm still trying to get at WebOnt speed... 
I first thought to use eg:chainOf, but then I thought that ont:samePropertyAs would be better... At least the ( ) thing is a DAML list (also with a similar chain of bnodes). 
The whole idea is pure "declarative".
