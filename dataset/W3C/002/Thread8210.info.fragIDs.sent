<s> (sorry, operator error) The example response is: and the spec says furthermore: "In this example the lockdiscovery property is empty which means that there are no outstanding locks on the resource."  </s>
<s> What's the point in returning the DAV:lockdiscovery property if it will always be empty (otherwise a 200 would have been returned).  </s>
<s> And shouldn't the response better be: ...because the error condition applies to the complete resource, not a specific property?  </s>
