<s> The next technical meeting on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning is currently scheduled for November 14-15 at Xerox PARC, in the SF Bay area.  </s>
<s> Larry Masinter has graciously offered to host this meeting -- thank you!  </s>
<s> Unlike the past meetings, this one is planned for two days to allow sufficient time for discussion of draft specifications for achieving distributed authoring and versioning capability.  </s>
<s> Please let me know soon if these dates will not work for you.  </s>
<s> So far these dates seem good for most people, based on email contact with people, and an informal show of hands at the Cambridge meeting.  </s>
<s> More details on registration, etc. will soon be forthcoming.  </s>

<s> I'll admit, I am extremely envious, and sorry I am the only european in the group.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I cannot afford to take part to any meeting in the  </s>
<s> States unless I find some funding on the way, which, at the state, seems at best unlikely (Microsoft?).  </s>
<s> I was wondering if there could be a willingness to organize one of our meetings at the University of Bologna, Italy.  </s>
<s> Bologna is the oldest universities of the western civilization, having been founded in 1088 (one, zero, eight, eight) for lax and medicine studies.  </s>
<s> Besides being famous for art and cuisine, Bologna is also 1/2 from Florence, Venice and Ravenna, and has a good air connections with most European airports (Rome, Paris, Brussels, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, etc.).  </s>
<s> I could organize something around December or January.  </s>

<s> At present, the majority of active participants on this list are located in the United States, with slightly more on the West Coast than on the East Coast.  </s>
<s> This has been the driving factor in keeping the meetings in the US.  </s>
<s> I'm game for holding a meeting in Europe, especially since I've never been to Italy, but I suspect that many of the people who have been coming to these meetings would be unable to make it.  </s>
<s> My fear is we would end up losing several months, or end up with a result which did not reflect a consensus view, if we were to hold a meeting in Europe at which there was poor attendance.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I do realize that the web was invented in Europe, and there are many people there who are knowledgable about the WWW, and versioning issues.  </s>
<s> It certainly would be nice if their knowledge could be easily applied to this effort.  </s>
