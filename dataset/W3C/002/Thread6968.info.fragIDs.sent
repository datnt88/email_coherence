<s> Subject: Re: UR* schemes [was: 3rd IETF/W3C coordination call...]  </s>
<s> I believe Tim's argument against more central registries is that it would be even better to have no central registries.  </s>
<s> We have one central registry, DNS, and that should be enough.  </s>
<s> We have problems enough with that one registry.  </s>
<s> No, I don't think so.  </s>
<s> The reason DNS has been a problem is arguably that it there is too much control in one place - so one particular enterprise (NSI) has been able to unfairly restrict access to the registry and to demand tribute from those using it.  </s>
<s> ICANN might help that situation (only time will tell) - but it's been incredibly difficult to get it going, largely due to  </s>
<s> opposition  </s>
<s> from NSI and NSI-funded loonies - partially because NSI could use the tribute money to build its war chest.  </s>
<s> You tell an awful story of a public trust being given to a commercial entity and commercially exploited.  </s>
<s> But because we (the community) have badly managed this thing there is no reason to double the problem.  </s>
<s> Let us do our utmost not to wring our hands over NSI's control but to ensure as speedily and effectively that it be done well under ICANN.  </s>
<s> Imagine the situation if NSI had control over all of the ICANN registries because they were all under the DNS root.  </s>
<s> Now this perverts the argument.  </s>
<s> NSI may have "control" over the IETF in that it can charge IETF $100 for the use of the name "ietf.org".  </s>
<s> NSI coulld in principle (though at risk of a bloody revolution) try deleting ietf.org if the IETF didn't pay, or just from malice or incompetence.  </s>
<s> But these are unlikely scenarios.  </s>
<s> But otherwise, NSI has no control over what IETF does with that space.  </s>
<s> The IETF defines what document is identified by The IETF can, without any recourse to NSI or ICANN, set up (say) a MIME type registry by defining (say) to be a document defining the MIME type application/xml This uses the DNS root in a very minor way, giving all control of content to the IETF.  </s>
<s> It has the advantage of using a space which is everywhere dereferencable using a well known protocol whose evolution is under IETF control.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, it's a feature of many registries that they use compact encodings (e.g. to minimize payload impact) and/or human-meaningful strings.  </s>
<s> You can of course define Content-type: to take as a parameter a URL relative to http://www.w3.org/mime-types/, which leaves it as a first class object (anyone can play with one) with a short form for those types which have passed muster at the IETF.  </s>
<s> I see absolutely no value and much harm in trying to use DNS names for port numbers, autonomous system numbers, DNS query types,  </s>
<s> etc. I wouldn't suggest DNS names by themselves, but http space is much more appropriate.  </s>
<s> specially when poulated with XML, it allows much more flexible control  </s>
<s> And to encode header field names, URI prefixes, etc. as DNS names strikes me as a very dubious compromise - it's essentially saying that it's more important to keep the protocol registries absolutely open (or more accurately, to put all of the control in one place)  </s>
<s> Here you confuse the control NSI has in registering the "ietf.org"  </s>
<s> name with the control the IETF has with its contents.  </s>
<s> This is a bit like saying that the state of Massachusetts controls my car.  </s>
<s> I used their space to register it, but I control its contents and direction!  </s>
<s> and to encourage vendor-specific protocol extensions, than it is to make the prefixes terse, meaningful to humans, or transcribable, or to try to encourage review or standardization of extensions.  </s>
<s> The balance between experimentation and standardization is a crucial part of our world.  </s>
<s> The methods we have used to strike a compromise up till now have involved "x-" and either "ignore what you don't understand" or "panic at what you don't understand".  </s>
<s> Neither of these is strong enough for the future.  </s>
<s> We must have private experiments (or local use) and standards, and have both well defined.  </s>
<s> For this, the languages must be first class objects, so we have free expression coupled with an explict system of review and endorsement.  </s>
<s> IETF working groups have a lot of latitude when choosing extension mechanisms for new protocols - see RFC 2434.  </s>
<s> Different groups choose different mechanisms for different protocols after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each.  </s>
<s> This seems entirely appropriate.  </s>
<s> Each group then sets up a standards process for its area of interest.  </s>
<s> One should recognise, however, that developers of a spec which references a list of specs should not always assume that their own process will be the only one which will W3C's XML references a set of namepsaces.  </s>
<s> There is no assumption that all namepsaces to achieve standards status must pass though the W3C.  </s>
<s> To make such an assumption would put a bottleneck on development.  </s>
<s> So, a namepsce is a identified by a URI.  </s>
<s> This doesn't stop us setting up, later, a "better namespaces bureau" which endorses namespaces which have gone though some general standards track.  </s>
<s> IIRC we discussed this topic in a previous teleconference, so I don't think we should spend time on it again.  </s>
<s> Pointer?  </s>
<s> Sure, but do URNs really offer anything new, or is it only an illusion of something new?  </s>
<s> This has been discussed many times.  </s>
<s> URNs are a notational convention.  </s>
<s> They were deliberately made to look different than other kinds of URIs in the hope that users would associate somewhat different semantics with URNs than with other URIs.  </s>
<s> There is an imputation of "semantics" on other URIs which is a political statement not a technical one, an derrogation of other URIs to leave a niche for URNs.  </s>
<s> In so doing, the set of identifiers is split into two, and hence the web is split into two.  </s>
<s> This is purely a human-interface issue.  </s>
<s> Well, no, when you make a syntax deliberately different just to make a point you also make a technically messy system.  </s>
<s> We agree that it is possible to build protocol engines that allow URLs to be stable over a long time,  </s>
<s> It is not an "engine" in as much as an insitutional commitment by the party owning the URI - with any URI, http: or some "URN" scheme.  </s>
<s> but the point of URNs is to make that stability (or at least, the intent of stability) a visible part of the identifier.  </s>
<s> You cannot make stability out of syntax.  </s>
<s> This could have been done in many ways, but after much deliberation the URN working group chose a particular syntax for URNs and particular rules for assigning them to ensure (if those rules are followed) uniqueness and stability.  </s>
<s> The rules can be applied to URIs just as well.  </s>
<s> You cannot enfore uniqueness wiith syntax either.  </s>
<s> The work is done, the decisions have been made, it's now up for users and implementors to decide whether they are sufficiently valuable to use.  </s>
<s> I will however note that in relation to the first topic, the URN group worked very hard to avoid having a central point of control over URN space - especially over URN resolution - while still preventing conflicts in URN assignment, realizing that such control would be an impediment both to deployment of URNs and to their long-term stability.  </s>
<s> You might or might not believe that they were successful - but this was one of the tough problems that they tried to tackle.  </s>
<s> Let those who would tackle these problems do so for their own web sites, establishing a persistence policy and a contractual commitments which allow URIs to be trsuted as persistent.  </s>
<s> Trying to sum up my concerns about the whole URN development: 1.  </s>
<s> It is based on a lack of society to currently to support the facilities for persistence (including soft redirection) in HTTP.  </s>
<s> 2. The lack of URN dereferencing protocol may lead to a reinvention of HTTP, with consequent unnecessary and serious complication of the web;  </s>
<s> 3. The suggestion that URNs will solve the persistence problem is causing serious archive maintainers to ignore their duty of persistence while "waiting for URNs", and thus making the problem much worse.  </s>
<s> 4. The actual registry of URN names is in fact more or less at the "/etc/hosts" stage, and has yet to reinvent the hierarchical structure of DNS and the social structrue of ICANN  </s>
<s> 5. In this "waiting", web sites fail to learn to use HTTP redirects properly (eg http://www.isi.edu/div7/iana/) and browsers fail to distinguish a "found" lookup and a "moved" redirection, making understanding of the semantics  </s>
<s> of HTTP in the community worse.  </s>
<s> Tim  </s>
<s> Keith  </s>
<s> Tim, I'm not going to get into a long argument here about the use of URLs in protocol parameters.  </s>
<s> Many of the issues involved either have nothing to do with the URI list, or would need to be discussed in a much wider community for the discussion to be meaningful.  </s>
<s> But IMHO the goals are highly dubious and the result you seem to want would be extremely difficult to acheive.  </s>
<s> OTOH, there are probably *some* protocol parameters for which it would be appropriate to either define a mapping between those parameters and URIs, or to delegate a portion of that parameter space to be filled by suitably encoded URIs or DNS names.  </s>
<s> Content-types might be an example of such a parameter space, though I have reservations about this.  </s>
<s> But these would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by folks knowledgable in each of the protocols.  </s>
<s> (e.g. issues regarding assignment of content-types should probably be discussed on the ietf-types@alvestrand.no  </s>
<s> mailing list.) As for URNs (which have nothing whatsoever to do with the above), I find the argument against URNs fairly vacuous.  </s>
<s> URNs are intended as a syntatic convention for the benefit of humans.  </s>
<s> Saying that there should not be URNs is a bit like saying that there should be no syntactic conventions in human language, e.g. that there should not be a convention that adverbs in English end in -ly.  </s>
<s> Note that the -ly convention is useful even though not all adverbs end in -ly (and that not all words ending in -ly are adverbs) -- the convention still works often enough that it assists our brains in their interpretation of adverbs (both in assigning meaning to the word and associating it with the appropriate adjective or verb) when we hear or read them.  </s>
<s> Similarly, the URN: prefix convention is intended to allow our brains to distinguish them from other URIs and to think "this is highly likely to be a stable reference".  </s>
<s> Of course, the fact that syntactic conventions are often useful in languages doesn't mean that the URN: convention is useful enough to be worth the trouble, but saying that there should be no such convention is a bit like saying that people shouldn't be able to coin new words.  </s>
<s> People do coin new words, and new language conventions, and they succeed or fail based on whether other people adopt those words and conventions.  </s>
<s> URLs *can* be stable references, but there is no way to know whether they are stable or not by looking at them.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the inclusion of temporal things in a URL like protocol-specific prefixes, company- specific domain names, and human readable directory and file names decrease the liklihood that a URL can have a stable meaning over a long period of time - because old protocols (including http) will eventually fall into disuse and new ones will be written, companies will merge or split up, domain names will change hands, directories will be reorganized, file and directory names will contain words that change meaning (or contain trademarks that change hands), etc.  </s>
<s> Some but not all of these can be fixed by adding a level of indirection.  </s>
<s> If you consider the lifetime of a work to be several decades or even centuries (the CNRI folks used to say 150 years because that was something close to the then-current limit for copyright) and you want to keep the same resource identifier associated with the work for that time, you need to avoid including things in that identifier that will damage the ability of the identifier to be associated with that resource over several decades.  </s>
<s> Since the meaning of almost any word can change, you want to avoid loading the resource identifier with temporal meanings.  </s>
<s> (no matter how hard you try, you can't get cern to send redirects for your web pages after you move if they don't want to do so... even though the mechanisms to to this exist in http. the only way to solve this problem is to not include cern's name in the name of your web pages in the first place.)  </s>
<s> These were the justifications behind having a slightly different syntactic convention for URNs than for other URIs.  </s>
<s> Different people can have different opinions on whether URNs are sufficiently valuable to be worth the trouble.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile, folks who don't want to assign URNs to their resources are not forced to use them.  </s>
<s> But given the design goals and constraints for URNs, the syntax that emerged is a fairly straightforward and obvious result.  </s>
<s> Of course it remains to be seen whether people accept the URN: convention - this will ultimately be decided based on whether or not it is useful.  </s>
<s> My guess is that it will initially be useful to a certain, fairly limited, sets of people (e.g., the Internet equivalent of library catalogers) and after it is established in certain circles the convention might eventually enjoy wider use (just as happened with ISBN numbers).  </s>
<s> But URNs were never intended to replace URLs (except perhaps early on before the URN problem was well articulated), there is very little overlap between the uses of the two, and folks who try to use URNs to replace URLs are likely to end up disappointed with the results.  </s>
<s> false.  </s>
<s> there were other motivations for URN development; and many of the problems addressed by URNs cannot be solved by indirection in HTTP.  </s>
<s> it's extremely unlikely that HTTP will be reinvented anytime soon; it has such mindshare that any new protocol for the same design space as HTTP would have a very difficult time displacing HTTP, even if it were significantly faster, less complex, better adapted to wireless, whatever.  </s>
<s> in other words, it would be difficult for something to replace HTTP even if it were better than HTTP for HTTP's design space.  </s>
<s> Indeed, the big problem in applications these days is to keep people from using HTTP (and LDAP) for purposes for which they are not well suited.  </s>
<s> OTOH, any protocols designed specifically for URN dereferencing would have vastly different requirements and therefore different characteristics than HTTP.  </s>
<s> this is not reinventing HTTP, it's inventing a new protocol for a new purpose.  </s>
<s> this seems entirely appropriate if sufficient value can be added to make the extra complexity worthwhile.  </s>
<s> well, URNs are here now, so they don't need to wait any longer.  </s>
<s> true, there has been a somewhat-persistent (hopefully not long-term- persistent) belief that URNs would prevent URLs from ever becoming stale, end nuclear war, cure world hunger, etc.  </s>
<s> The fact that people believed things like this only means that URNs were misunderstood.  </s>
<s> While such understanding is unfortunate, it doesn't mean that URNs are useless or that they cannot survive this misunderstanding.  </s>
<s> A great deal of misunderstanding results every time a new net protocol is widely hyped in the trade press, but usually the hype fades after a while and folks can use (or not use) those protocols according to whether it actually makes sense to do so - rather than based on their buzzword compliance or lack thereof.  </s>
<s> this is an interesting point.  </s>
<s> as URNs aren't supposed to contain much that is human meaningful (it interferes with their purpose) having hierarchy in URN NIDs doesn't necessarily seem like a good idea.  </s>
<s> The main purpose of the NID is to separate URN space into multiple sub-spaces, both for distributed control, and to allow grandfathering of existing stable identifiers under URN space.  </s>
<s> In this sense it is vaguely analogous to TLD space in the DNS.  </s>
<s> Some delegation of NID-space (not in an explicitly hierarchical fashion) might be useful, but probably only if whoever was running the NID registry were exercising too much control.  </s>
<s> However, given the purpose and anticipated uses of URNs it seems unlikely that control of URN NID space would be anywhere nearly as controversial or hotly contested as control of DNS TLD space, at least not in the near term.  </s>
<s> At some point it might be appropriate to delegate control of URN NID space to ICANN rather than IANA, precisely because of the ICANN social structure.  </s>
<s> But it's difficult to see why this would be useful - or what difference it would make - in the near term.  </s>
<s> IIRC, there are already visibility, public review, and multiple levels of appeal for URN namespace review.  </s>
<s> And ICANN currently has the contract to run IANA, so the same people would handle the assignment in either case.  </s>
<s> in general there seems to be a lag - often measured in many years - between the time that protocol features are developed and the time that it takes for implementors to get the subtle features right, and even more time before users to figure out how to use them properly.  </s>
<s> (and the two happen in strict order - users won't utilize them until vendors get their implementations right) so if "serious archive maintainers" aren't providing persistence for HTTP-accessible resources using HTTP-accessible features (to the degree that this is feasible) then my guess is that it's because they don't yet understand how to use those HTTP features, and that this is largely because the browsers don't implement them properly.  </s>
<s> And I don't see how the presence or absence of URNs has much effect on whether browser vendors implement redirects correctly for HTTP.  </s>
<s> Keith  </s>
<s> Howdy, Let me leap into this stream and straighten out a few things about URNs.  </s>
<s> "URN" is not a notational convention, it is a URI scheme that defines a particular syntax and resolution specification.  </s>
<s> That syntax is used to allow sub-delegation of namespaces, and the resolution specification specifically supports the further subdelegation of namespace components -- partitioning the space of identifiers, or providing multiple redundant services for identifiers, or providing different end-resolution protocols for identifiers, for instance.  </s>
<s> This approach was selected in an effort to maximize the ability to support persistence in naming.  </s>
<s> It is true this cannot be enforced.  </s>
<s> But now that the specifications are on the table, it is time to stop arguing about what a URN "is" philosophically, and look instead at what the URN scheme _does_.  </s>
<s> There are communities that have applications for making their resources available on the net (note: I said net, not necessarily Web) that want a scheme that _does_ the above.  </s>
<s> They need software that can recognize identifiers that belong to this scheme, so that the software can apply the correct resolution steps and achieve the expected result, in a controlled fashion (by selecting resolution services from those discovered, not by being "bounced" in a redirect from one to another).  </s>
<s> So, if you want to argue that it could all be done in HTTP, sit down, write up the proposal for how to use HTTP (redirects and all) to establish and maintain a global resolution service for the URN scheme, to do what URN does today.  </s>
<s> If it's better than what exists today, let's replace the current one.  </s>
<s> But saying URNs are "bad" is extremely pass?, and some of this is beginning to sound like "stupid user" stories.  </s>
<s> The users are the customers, and they'll pick what works for them.  </s>
