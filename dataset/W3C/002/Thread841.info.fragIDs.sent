Hi, I am interest in understanding the underline architecture of Tidy as I want to hack and add features to it such as support coversion to xhtml-print. 
I could not find any documentations that can help me in this. 
Does any one has any or knows where I can get my hands on the developers guideline or something in that nature. 
Thank you, Peter
