<s> Good Morning Folks, I have been attempting to get IE5 to talk to our apache 1.3.14 server using the mod_dav module.  </s>
<s> Having played around extensively I cannot, for the life of me, get IE5 talking to the server.  </s>
<s> It appears that I need to install Frontpage extensions.  </s>
<s> In reading the archives of this list, I can't see anywhere that this gets a mention as being a requirement.  </s>
<s> My understanding of IE5 Web Folders was that it was fairly compliant and did not require extensions.  </s>
<s> Am I barking up the wrong tree?  </s>
<s> If this is not the right list for these comments, can somebody please point me in the right direction?  </s>

<s> IE5 and mod_dav are very interoperable.  </s>
<s> The dav-dev@lyra.org mailing list is the right place.  </s>
<s> See: For the information that we'll need to diagnose your problem, then post to the dav-dev list.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g ps. w3c-dist-auth is generally "implementation agnostic" and is about the protocol itself.  </s>

<s> I don't have any problems with web folders, Office 2000, IE5, or DreamWeaver, but FrontPage, Visual InterDev, and VS.NET don't do WebDAV.  </s>

<s> I can tell you mod_dav definitely works with Web Folders.  </s>
<s> (So does my product, Xythos WebFile Server, on apache or off).  </s>
<s> The trick may be that you've got to set up a web folder: IE 5.5 doesn't know that it's talking to a WebDAV server unless you tell it.  </s>
<s> Depending on the OS, this is done by creating a new network place in "my network places" or a new web folder in "Web Folders".  </s>
<s> We've got instructions on www.sharemation.com  </s>
<s> to help people do this.  </s>
<s> Frontpage extensions are irrelevant.  </s>
