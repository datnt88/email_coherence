<s> RFC 2518 section 8.7.2 speaks of PUT on Collections.  </s>
<s> It basically seems to say that RFC 2518 is intentionally silent on the matter.  </s>
<s> I'm curious...  </s>
<s> I generally thnk of PUT and GET as complimentary.  </s>
<s> I'd expect collections to be able to accept PUT requests because they can accept GET requests.  </s>

<s> Generally speaking, GET on a DAV collection Ought To work just like it would if that resource weren't DAV--it should treat it as a GET on index.html, or whatever.  </s>
<s> We don't want to break existing browsers, after all.  </s>
<s> That being said, it might be nice if a DAV client could customize, or at least query, which resource(s) a collection uses (plural because it can be handy to specify a search list: index.cgi,  </s>

<s> Maybe a DAV:defaultresource property, which contains a list of resource elements; each element contains (or is) either an href or a DAV:directorylist/ .  </s>
<s> Some servers might not support setting it, but querying it should be fairly easy.  </s>
