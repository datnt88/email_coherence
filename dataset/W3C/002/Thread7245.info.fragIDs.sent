<s> Here is my 1-2 paragraph summary of the WEBDAV Working Group meeting held at the Munich IETF.  </s>
<s> The WEBDAV Working Group met at the Munich IETF on Monday, August 11, 1997, from 13:00 to 15:00.  </s>
<s> There were 54 attendees throughout the duration of the meeting.  </s>
<s> The meeting was chaired by Jim Whitehead, and notes were recorded by Del Jensen.  </s>
<s> The meeting began with a short overview presentation on WebDAV, which was followed by a presentation giving an overview of the design of the properties and collections functionality in the WebDAV protocol specification.  </s>
<s> After this presentation, the remainder of the meeting was concerned with discussing a series of open issues.  </s>
<s> During the issues discussion, the attendees were in favor of the following recommendations: - The DAV property identifiers (i.e., ";DAV/" + property URL), discussed in Section 2.4 of draft-ietf-webdav-requirements-01.txt, should not be used, and should be removed from the spec.  </s>
<s> - The SEARCH method (Section 2.6.5) should be renamed to PROPGET (or GETPROP or FINDPROP), and should be limited to retrieving just named resources from a given resource.  </s>
<s> There should be an additional mechanism  </s>
<s> for retrieving the names of all properties on a given resource without  </s>
<s> having to retrieve their values as well.  </s>
<s> - The property attributes "live" and "readonly" (Section 2.3.1, 2.3.2) should not be returned with each property instance retrieval, but should instead be retrievable via a schema discovery mechanism (TBD) which would state the extent (i.e., which namespace) and attributes (live, readonly) of a property.  </s>
<s> - The Depth header (and hence recursive semantics for method invocations)  </s>
<s> should be moved to a separate specification, which will proceed separately  </s>
<s> from draft-ietf-webdav-protocol.  </s>
<s> There was a suggestion to not use a Depth  </s>
<s> header, but to instead define separate functions (e.g., DEEPCOPY) for the  </s>
<s> recursive analog to existing methods.  </s>
<s> - Atomic locking of collections (Section 5.3.1.2 of draft-ietf-webdav-re quirements-01.txt) was discussed, and it was agreed that the requirement should stay as-is, that efforts should be made to satisfy this requirement in the protocol specification, but that there should be an awareness that this requirement might not be satisfied.  </s>
<s> - Authoring support for language variants was discussed, and no firm resolution was achieved.  </s>
<s> - Jim Whitehead ejw@ics.uci.edu  </s>
<s> My experience is that recursive or multi-level methods for copying data  </s>
<s> structures are actually quite varied, and that the reason for doing the  </s>
<s> separation is that you will find that you need more information than just the depth to determine the actual semantics of the operation, and that further "copy to N levels" is fundamentally a different operation than "just copy this top-level operation".  </s>
<s> (E.g., as a point to consider, note that typical Lisp language definitions have had many different copy operations, depending on how carefully they attempted to preserve structure.  </s>
<s> While it is possible to overload a single copy operation just by adding additional parameters, the implementations were considerably different.)  </s>
<s> I have been thinking about this and I admit that I change my view depending upon the prevailing winds.  </s>
<s> On one hand methods are NOT implementation bound, they are abstractions.  </s>
<s> So a Depth header would say "Instead of just copying the resource, copy the resource and all its children."  </s>
<s> Same abstraction, even if the implementation is completely different from the way a single copy is implemented.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, additional semantics are caused by the Depth on say a move where there are order requirements such that the hierarchy must first be created and then the resource moved.  </s>
<s> Still, I'm not fully convinced that this change is far enough from the spirit of move to require a separate method name.  </s>
<s> Currently the only thing that I really like about a new method name is that it means we don't have to use PEP.  </s>
