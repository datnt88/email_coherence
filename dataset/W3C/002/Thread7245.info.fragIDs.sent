Here is my 1-2 paragraph summary of the WEBDAV Working Group meeting held at the Munich IETF. 
The WEBDAV Working Group met at the Munich IETF on Monday, August 11, 1997, from 13:00 to 15:00. 
There were 54 attendees throughout the duration of the meeting. 
The meeting was chaired by Jim Whitehead, and notes were recorded by Del Jensen. 
The meeting began with a short overview presentation on WebDAV, which was followed by a presentation giving an overview of the design of the properties and collections functionality in the WebDAV protocol specification. 
After this presentation, the remainder of the meeting was concerned with discussing a series of open issues. 
During the issues discussion, the attendees were in favor of the following recommendations: - The DAV property identifiers (i.e., ";DAV/" + property URL), discussed in Section 2.4 of draft-ietf-webdav-requirements-01.txt, should not be used, and should be removed from the spec. 
- The SEARCH method (Section 2.6.5) should be renamed to PROPGET (or GETPROP or FINDPROP), and should be limited to retrieving just named resources from a given resource. 
There should be an additional mechanism 
for retrieving the names of all properties on a given resource without 
having to retrieve their values as well. 
- The property attributes "live" and "readonly" (Section 2.3.1, 2.3.2) should not be returned with each property instance retrieval, but should instead be retrievable via a schema discovery mechanism (TBD) which would state the extent (i.e., which namespace) and attributes (live, readonly) of a property. 
- The Depth header (and hence recursive semantics for method invocations) 
should be moved to a separate specification, which will proceed separately 
from draft-ietf-webdav-protocol. 
There was a suggestion to not use a Depth 
header, but to instead define separate functions (e.g., DEEPCOPY) for the 
recursive analog to existing methods. 
- Atomic locking of collections (Section 5.3.1.2 of draft-ietf-webdav-re quirements-01.txt) was discussed, and it was agreed that the requirement should stay as-is, that efforts should be made to satisfy this requirement in the protocol specification, but that there should be an awareness that this requirement might not be satisfied. 
- Authoring support for language variants was discussed, and no firm resolution was achieved.

My experience is that recursive or multi-level methods for copying data 
structures are actually quite varied, and that the reason for doing the 
separation is that you will find that you need more information than just the depth to determine the actual semantics of the operation, and that further "copy to N levels" is fundamentally a different operation than "just copy this top-level operation". 
(E.g., as a point to consider, note that typical Lisp language definitions have had many different copy operations, depending on how carefully they attempted to preserve structure. 
While it is possible to overload a single copy operation just by adding additional parameters, the implementations were considerably different.) 
I have been thinking about this and I admit that I change my view depending upon the prevailing winds. 
On one hand methods are NOT implementation bound, they are abstractions. 
So a Depth header would say "Instead of just copying the resource, copy the resource and all its children." 
Same abstraction, even if the implementation is completely different from the way a single copy is implemented. 
On the other hand, additional semantics are caused by the Depth on say a move where there are order requirements such that the hierarchy must first be created and then the resource moved. 
Still, I'm not fully convinced that this change is far enough from the spirit of move to require a separate method name. 
Currently the only thing that I really like about a new method name is that it means we don't have to use PEP.
