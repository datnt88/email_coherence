Hi, first off - great tool. 
Our organization is moving to HTML for all internal documentation, and I've just began to use Tidy to clean up Word 2000 files. 
There is one problem I'm having though - in netscape/ie, tables look weird when there are empty cells (no regular border resulting in a large blank patch in the middle of the table). 
The original word2000 files used to put a &amp;nbsp; in the empty cells to fix this, but unfortuantely Tidy strips this out. 
Is there an option to make sure tables appear regularly gridded? 
(I'm presuming a space or character in every cell is the only way to achieve this right? 
While I'm here - anyone know of a decent wysiwyg HTML editor for windows for the non-techies in our orgnaization? 
Thanks, 
nick

I use Netscape Communicator's composer for simple HTML pages, or to very quick create a basis to work on (then run it thru Tidy then start the hard stuff by hand).

Hello Nick, 
put a BR into the otherwise empty table cell and it will appear as you wish (as long as you wish the cell to be at least one line high). 
If you _must_ - use Macromedia's Dreamweaver... 
But nothing can substitute profound knowledge of the HTML Standards. 
them, if the stuff at www.w3.org appears to be too "dry" or "techie"...

Thanks Sebastian, I believe either a space or br will work. 
My question however was was if there is a way for Tidy to strip out spaces? 
Asking all Word users to manually break each cell of a very large table so there exists a br instead of a space is hardly an option. 
My fault - I should have said we need a free/open-source editor, not a commercial site manager. 
Dreamweaver doesn't really cut it for site-management here - no support for CVS versioning or ssh/scp syncronization.

Hello Nick, well, do you have Perl available? 
I would use a small Perl script to post-process the Tidy output and fix things like your empty table cell problem. 
a regular expression like the following should do the job: # put a BR into empty table cells $tidied_data =~ s/( TD[^ ]*? )\s*( \/TD[^ ]*? )/$1 BR $2/gsi; # replace &amp;nbsp; with a BR in otherwise empty table cells $tidied_data =~ s/( TD[^ ]*? )\s*&amp;nbsp;\s*( \/TD[^ ]*? )/$1 BR $2/gsi; # do both at once and for table headers as well $tidied_data =~ s/( T[HD][^ ]*? )((\s*&amp;nbsp;)?\s*)( 
\/T[HD][^ ]*? )/$1 BR $3/gsi; Regarding the Editor, I have no better suggestion, sorry. 
Have a nice day, Nick... we shouldn't be working on a holiday... ;-) sebastian

Netscape has been suggested. 
What about Amaya? 
To my frustration it's not available on Macs, but it is available for UNIX and Windows. 
It doesn't do downloads, and it doesn't handle some of the picture formats out there, but it *does* get its HTML right, which is more than you can say for any other HTML editor I've seen. 
It has one particularly nice feature: it can show you what the document would look like in a plain-text browser, which can help you produce more accessible text.
