Hi all! 
I have asked this question some time ago, but I cannot remember if there has been an answer to it. 
So please apologize if you feel a bit bored ;-) 
Why is the content model chosen for the Transform element "mixed"? 
All other elements which describe an Algorithm, like * SignatureMethod * DigestMethod * CanonicalizationMethod 
are useing the same structure, except that their content model 
is "elementOnly". 
My way of thinking is that if I would like to specify parameters for an algorithm, I have do invent an Elemenent which I can then put into the Transform Element representing the algorithm. 
Why is it allowed to specify text as parameter content for a Transform, whereas it is forbidden for all other types of algorithms?

The theory was that people might want to provide elements or charactered data (or both) since we could not anticipate the various expressions and transforms applications might want to perform. 
But that these were rather straightforward. 
There's no compelling argument that this must be the way it is. 
Are you suggestion we move all the Methods to mixed as well?

Yes, I think it would be fine to have the same structure for all kind of algorithms.
