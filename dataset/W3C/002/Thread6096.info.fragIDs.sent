<s> Thanks for taking the time to write this paper, I think it makes a very important and clear distinction between CPL and CDL, which fit well with  </s>
<s> Martin's definition of orchestration.  </s>
<s> I agree pretty much with everything you say, except for one point: you are talking about "prose" and "non-executable logic".  </s>
<s> I strongly disagree with that point.  </s>
<s> If it is true that as a global view, a CDL does not have an engine to ensure its execution, one of the value of a machine processable CDL is  </s>
<s> that each party can validate the choreography of messages based on rules  </s>
<s> defined in a CDL.  </s>
<s> So for me it is a requirement that the "prose" you are talking about be machine processable.  </s>
<s> Again, if you are a big organization, you are going to receive in the order of 100,000 to 1,000,000 messages per day.  </s>
<s> Having a CDL that help you validate whether or not you are supposed to receive any of these messages before you start processing them is going to save a lot of code  </s>
<s> within each application (not too mention that a given choreography could  </s>
<s> involve multiple of your applications, which would compound the problem).  </s>
<s> However there is catch when expressing this business logic.  </s>
<s> In order for  </s>
<s> each participant to "know" the state of the choreography, this business  </s>
<s> logic can only be expressed on the information being exchanged by any two parties.  </s>
<s> For instance we could not have a transition "if I approved your order" because the buyer has no way to know this information from the supplier unless you specifically exchange a message containing this information.  </s>
<s> This type of information becomes "prose".  </s>
<s> Interestingly enough, the business logic of CPL is the prose of CDL.  </s>

<s> -----Original Message----- From: public-ws-chor-request@w3.org  </s>
<s> Yaron deserves thanks for producing this detailed writeup.  </s>
<s> A couple of first-pass comments:  </s>
<s> 1. It is stated that in a cDl (Choregraphy description language), "the logic that controls a particular transition is given in prose rather than in an executable form" (p.1).  </s>
<s> The issue I see with this is that it's unenforceable.  </s>
<s> Also there's no guarantee that implementation stays in sync with the description.  </s>
<s> 2. The notion of an abstract process is introduced in the 2nd use case, as a point intermediate in complexity and specificity between a  </s>
<s> choreography description and an executable choreography.  </s>
<s> This is  </s>
<s> interesting.  </s>
<s> Actually if you take the whole document, there are 4 possible levels discussed: a. Choreography description subset that allows round-tripping  </s>
<s> b. Full choreography description  </s>
<s> c. Abstract business process d. Executable business process.  </s>
<s> The implications of these various levels for the spec are not fully clear to me.  </s>
<s> I wonder if Yaron had something like the "external" portion of BPEL in  </s>
<s> mind at the abstract business process level.  </s>
<s> --Jon  </s>
<s> What you call non-executable I actually call executable.  </s>
<s> Different from  </s>
<s> an implementation, since a service can't execute a choreography on its  </s>
<s> own, it takes two to tango, and even all services involved can't execute  </s>
<s> the choreography based strictly on the choreography definition, they  </s>
<s> need more information than that (the implementation details).  </s>
<s> But at the  </s>
<s> end of the day, given the choreography they participate in and the  </s>
<s> implementation that acts on it, they end up executing the choreography.  </s>
<s> Prose is not on of my favorite terms.  </s>
<s> It seems to suggest that perhaps XHTML might be a better starting point then say WSDL ;-)  </s>

<s> Here's my $0.02c on Yaron's paper which I find expresses thoughts generally  </s>
<s> similar to my own.  </s>
<s> 1. Introduction: CDl is a set of rules that can be used to validate the  </s>
<s> correct execution of a choreography instance raising errors if the rules are  </s>
<s> not followed 2. Requirements:  </s>
<s> a) a CDl should also be extensible, for example there are multiple different ways of placing an order where each one is gradually more complex  </s>
<s> than an earlier version [1] b) Components such as reliability and security should be in a separate  </s>
<s> layer otherwise the choreography is not reusable  </s>
<s> 3.2 Use Case: Equal Partners a) I can envisage a situation where the same business process could sometimes be implemented reliably and sometimes not.  </s>
<s> This suggests that identification of reliability to use with a choreography should be contained in a binding of the the base CDl to an implementation.  </s>
<s> Other things that  </s>
<s> need to be bound in the same way include: message content, message  </s>
<s> packaging, use of security and things like business timeouts.  </s>
<s> 4.5 Segmentation a) If you are hiding part of a choreography, then really the choreography is not a public choreography but is really a private choreography.  </s>
<s> In this case isn't the CDl really more of a template CPl as the complete definition is under the control of just one participant.  </s>
<s> b) Similarly if you have segmentation, then it can tend to inhibit reuse as the part of the choreography that is being segmented out could actually be a common choreography that could have been reused elsewhere c) There is also a difference between C, for example, knowing the complete choreography without knowing which organization is B. This would probably be OK from the privacy of information perspective.  </s>
<s> In fact there can often be multiple different organizations who can be a "B".  </s>
<s> d) Bottom line, I would view each of the interactions described as probably separate choreographies with their own choreography definitions that have then been assembled for use in a business process owned by A defined using a CPl.  </s>
<s> 4.7 Annotations a) I agree that signal messages could be useful.  </s>
<s> However, this really is  </s>
<s> treading into application territory so needs to be treated with care and it would be wise to leave it to later.  </s>
<s> So, how about this as the layers that are required: 1. Template Choroegraphy Definition.  </s>
<s> This is written in a CDl and is something that an organization like RosettaNet could develop, but is not specific on detailed message content  </s>
<s> (as it varies), or the service instances that are used 2. (Actual) Choreography Definition.  </s>
<s> This is optionally based (by reference) on a Template Choreography  </s>
<s> Definition but includes the specific message formats, services, etc that are  </s>
<s> used.  </s>
<s> An open question is whether this is single document or, alternatively  </s>
<s> a Template Choreography Definition with a binding to an instance 3. Segmented Choreography Definition  </s>
<s> This is a single roles view of a Template (?) Choreography Definition and  </s>
<s> could be used as the starting point for a business process to support the  </s>
<s> choreography  </s>
<s> I would like to submit the following use cases and requirements for  </s>
<s> consideration by the working group -  </s>
<s> Besides providing what I personally believe to be critical requirements for  </s>
<s> the success of the working group I also think they help to outline what I  </s>

<s> Of  </s>
<s> course all opinions on such differences are mine and mine alone, your mileage may vary, objects in mirror are closer than they appear.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> I think that to make run-time validation work you need three identifiers in the headers of any message that is received which are: 1.  </s>
<s> The Choreography Definition identifier 2. The Interaction (i.e. message exchange) within the Choreography  </s>
<s> Definition, and  </s>
<s> 3. A Choreography Instance identifier You can then: 1. Map the Interaction to a specific Message format although in reality you are more likely to say that a particular Message format can support various interactions in various choreographies  </s>
<s> 2. Map states and conditions in the choreography to data in specific Message  </s>
<s> Formats.  </s>
<s> As a result you could automatically validate that an individual message  </s>
<s> received conformed to the rules of the choreography.  </s>

<s> -----Original Message----- From: public-ws-chor-request@w3.org  </s>
<s> From what I recall RosettaNet has a finite set of patterns (four that I can recall) and a lot of different PIPs.  </s>
<s> Each PIP is defined individually because it relates to different set of operations.  </s>
<s> Each operation defines which messages are being used, hopefully generically enough to allow some variety.  </s>
<s> But you won't be plugging an RFQ message into a cancel PO PIP, even if the pattern of interaction is the same (request/response).  </s>
<s> To me this seems to tie well to the recommended use of WSDL for abstraction, but I'm beating the same drum over and over ;-) The question I have is what is exactly suggested by the use case.  </s>
<s> The term prose as I read it means a cDl that is not necessarily machine processable, just an artifact that you can use to build machine processable definitions.  </s>
<s> In that case you can get as much abstraction as you want, either by binding things to it or simply by not specifying them.  </s>
<s> We can imagine a language where you just write templates and there's no need for binding.  </s>
<s> Since a lot of people like to see that, that's an option for us to discuss.  </s>
<s> But if that's the case, can't we just ignore WSDL?  </s>
<s> Let other languages or standards deal with how to use WSDL for choreographies and let's focus on those abstract templates.  </s>
<s> Use a cDl language not based on WSDL to write choreographies, and a language based on WSDL to write actual  </s>
<s> choreography MEPs.  </s>
<s> Yaron, if that's what you intended than I need one clarification  </s>
<s> regarding your statement that our deliverables should be based on WSDL  </s>
<s> 1.2.  </s>
<s> Do you mean that we should identify some non-prose cPl language  </s>
<s> that is based on WSDL and adopt it?  </s>
<s> Develop both the prose cDl and  </s>
<s> non-prose cPl and the later should use WSDL 1.2?  </s>
<s> Provide mapping between  </s>
<s> the cDl and some cPl language that does use WSDL and incorporate  </s>
<s> appropriate rules into that mapping?  </s>
<s> In short, where does WSDL come into play with respect to the cDl and cPl?  </s>
<s> arkin  </s>
<s> The purpose of the cDl is to describe the message choreography.  </s>
<s> WSDL 1.2's  </s>
<s> role is to specify the exact messages and MEPs being used in the choreography.  </s>
<s> So the choreography would say something like: "Foo sends message BLAH to Bar" where 'message BLAH' would be a reference to a WSDL service/porttype/operation (or whatever the hell they call it now in WSDL 1.2).  </s>

<s> The way I read some of the e-mails in this discussion they seemed to assume that the cDl may do other things by being even more abstract.  </s>
<s> That's why I asked for the clarification.  </s>
<s> The term prose is also confusing.  </s>
<s> Let's say I have a choreography which  </s>
<s> defines that I send you some message X, get some business activity to occur at your end, and receive a response Y (let's say it's a single operation).  </s>
<s> That definition is not executable in the sense that it's insufficient to get the activity to occur on your side.  </s>
<s> Without the business logic nothing will happen.  </s>
<s> I prefer to think of it as simply being "not an implementation".  </s>
<s> You will still need an implementation of that operation on your side, which is the subject of other specifications (BPEL, Java, etc).  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if I want the activity to be executed all I need to do is perform that operation by sending you message X.  </s>
<s> So as far as I am concerned the operation definition is "executable".  </s>
<s> If I know your end-point I can get it to execute.  </s>
<s> But this is a different part of execution than an implementation, I still need an implementation on my side to invoke it and one on your side to perform it.  </s>
<s> The term prose implies that even this kind of execution is not possible.  </s>
<s> (And I know the term execution is controversial, for some people execution=implementation and for others implementation is an expansion of execution)  </s>
<s> In that case, what is the issue with languages like WSCI and BPEL?  </s>
<s> I know you can define implementations using BPEL which is out of scope, but can't you just use abstracts in this case to get a definition of the message choreography?  </s>
<s> What is missing?  </s>
<s> Similarly with WSCI.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it treads into the possible use as an implementation language (the cPl), but can't we just ignore these capabilities for now and simply exclude them from any resulting specification?  </s>
<s> So far the only thing I understood needs to be changed is removing XPaths.  </s>
