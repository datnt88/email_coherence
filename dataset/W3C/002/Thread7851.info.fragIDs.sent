<s> Does this sentence applies only to user-defined properties and not to DAV build-in properties like the lockdiscovery property?  </s>
<s> What is the correct server behaviour?  </s>
<s> Best, Hartmut  </s>
<s> Hartmut, DAV:lockdiscovery is a live property that always exists for every resource that supports locking.  </s>
<s> So mod_dav is correct in returning the empty property given that there are no locks.  </s>
<s> I suppose IIS could be considered correct too as there isn't that much difference between an empty element and no element in this case.  </s>

<s> It looks like the server implementors decided that lockdiscovery exists on all class 2 DAV resources.  </s>
