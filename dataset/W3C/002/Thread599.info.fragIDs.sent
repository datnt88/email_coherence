Dear Folks, 
When I noticed dozens of hits to my web page today coming from http://tidy.sourceforge.net 
, I checked out the original Tidy page http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ and saw that Dave Raggett has now redirected users to the SourceForge site. 
I guess we had better get our act together and release something grin . 
By the way, I have now got working the automatic uploading to the web site of the Tidy sources, documentation, and executable binaries for a number of 
platforms, whenever something changes. 
This automatic processing begins 11:30 pm PST each night, and should end around midnight (I have staggered the various cron jobs). 
A little bit more fine tuning may occur. 
Let me know of any problems. 
Regards, Terry 
I hope you don't mind the added pressure :-). 
I am still getting lots of emails arising from bugs with my old version. 
Even through we don't have an "official" release yet, users will benefit from the bug fixed included in the prerelease binaries linked from the Source Forge site.

I reckon this is a needed kick in the ... er, I mean nudge in the right direction! 
Thanks. 
The program itself will keep those bug lists coming to you if not changed... "Tidy -v" gives this ... HTML Tidy (release date: ...) See http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett for details and stderr after Tidying says ... To learn more about HTML Tidy see Please send bug reports to Dave Raggett care of Lobby your company to join W3C, see http://www.w3.org/Consortium /Jelks 
Yeah, that's how I ended up pulling an old copy of Tidy from the "wrong" site. 
The search engines also give priority to Dave's old site. 
BTW, thanks again Dave for a great tool (and the rest of ya'll). 
I can only hope that keeping up with the ability to "Tidy" the crud out of MS-Word will continue to be a priority. 
Thanks! -- Sherman Mohler, E-Learning Systems Architect Cisco Learning Institute
