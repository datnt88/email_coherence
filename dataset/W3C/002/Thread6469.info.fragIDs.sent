I really like the idea of this format for collecting user 
feedback. 
However, I note a lot of seemingly irrelevant mail showing up here. 
Can you explain that? 
Thanks 
Thank you. 
That's a good question. 
Every published email address in the world that doesn't bounce is vulnerable to spam. 
(Just for an example, my old addresses from years ago still get spam email every day.) Susan Lesch, W3C 
To solve this problem, we could require subscription to the list (which would be easy) and then we would reduce dramatically the amount of spam). 
Furthermore, we are working on a way to allow people to subscribe to just one w3c list and then for those where they had open access before, they wouldn't have to do anything special. 
In short, we are all suffering from the amount of spam we are getting and we're trying to find reasonable solutions. 
Stay tuned!
