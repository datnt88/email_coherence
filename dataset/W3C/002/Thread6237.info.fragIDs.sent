Agenda for Monday's MEP call, 1:00-2:30pm EDT Wednesday A. Continue discussing the effects of patterns on clients and services[1][2], particularly for cases: 1. Suppose a WSD specifies p2c 2. Suppose a WSD specifies p2e 
3. Suppose one client wishes to invoke a service using a third-party 
to receive the response, while another client wishes to invoke that 
service using classic request/response style. 
How could the service support both? 
B. What to recommend?
