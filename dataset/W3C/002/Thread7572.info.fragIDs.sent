First off, I don't beleve that WebDAV can't have anything to say about the choice of the namespace shape. 
It can (and does) require that URL's ending in "/" act like collections but can't say what collections exist and what 
goes in them. 
If a site chooses to put all of their documents into one collection and all of their "folders" into another, and not allow any to be created anywhere else that is a perfecly valid choice. 
Unfortunately it is not very helpful for someone trying to get at the site with a generic WebDAV client. 
Requiring that there also be a hierarchical representation is not something that WebDAV can do. 
On the other hand, users of a system probably will :-) 
Mapping the project/folder hierarchy from DM systems onto a tree has a couple of difficulties that I can see. 
First is that objects from the DM system can appear in the tree in more than one place. 
Second is that cycles can exist. 
I don't think WebDAV says anything specifically banning the first, but I would be curious as to other people's views on this. 
The second problem relates to depth infinity operations and to user navigation. 
Some of the depth infinity operations such as copy and move can be worked out fairly easily, but PROPFIND is a problem. 
In addition, users navigating down through a cycle can get arbitrarily deep, with arbitrarily long URLs.

I didnt think that was true, because it imposes on existing web servers that mere directories would suddenly become collections. 
However, I think that should be OK, if being a collection doesn't mean servers are required to do any more than they already do to support the collection. 
Still, it becomes kind of meaningless. 
I think there may be a confusion between hierarchical identifiers and collection containment. 
I am distinguishing them, such that the components of a collection may or may not be accessible via hierarchical URLs. 
If there were never any hierarchical URLs, that doesn't mean that resources cannot be members of collections; it would only mean you cannot access the components via extensions of the collection URLs. 
Hierarchial URLs do provide a convenient, more direct access to components of collections, but that is by no means the only way to access components of collections. 
Another way is to first access the 
collection and get lists of component URLs. 
A particular server might want to require the latter approach, perhaps to avoid any dependence that hierarchical URLs impose on the name space, i.e. the resources must be persistently contained within particular collections forever if the hierarchical URL is to be persistent. 
(There is more to that story if you want to hear it.) WebDAV already supports the notion of references to components of collections, so that is not the question. 
Use of references certainly means that collection containment does not necessarily correspond to physical containment, but that is true even without references. 
But furthermore, the existence of references raises other concerns such as containment in multiple collections, and circular references, as John mentioned. 
But regardless of references, we still have a separate question, which is the original question concerning the use of only non-hierarchical URLs with hierarchical collections. 
I still have not seen any reason given for prohibiting that combination. 
It is not sufficient to just say it is merely desirable - there must be some functionality that actually requires it.

If they want to call themselves DAV servers, then, yeah, they have to support things like PROPFIND. 
But we have to be able to go both ways: given a URL, you have to be able to find out what collection it belongs to.
