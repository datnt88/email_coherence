At the WG meeting, it was tentatively decided that the Face to Face meeting called for in the charter should be August 30-31 somewhere on the US West coast. 
Microsoft/Seattle and University of Califnornia/Irvine has tentatively volunteered to host the meeting. 
Because of the lead time required under W3C rules to announce face-to-face meetings, we plan to decide on the date and location within a few days. 
Any comments or other volunteers for space should post to the list immediately. 
Because the XML DSIG W3C workshop was held in the north eastern US and the first Face to Face at the 45th IETF meeting which is being held in Scandinavia, western North America seems like a fair place for the August meeting. 
The co-chairs and likely editors/authors of the main documents believe that the most convenient time for them for teleconferences would be Thursdays at 4PM. 
Tentative initial dates for calls would be Jul 22, Aug 5, Aug 19. 
Main purpose of calls is to coordinate progress on document and other assignments.

Joseph and/or Donald, I think we'll need a time zone to parse this.
