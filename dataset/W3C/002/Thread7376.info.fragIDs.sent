<s> The no-tagged production of an If header is to be applied to every resource to which the method is applied.  </s>
<s> This production can contain both state tokens and etags.  </s>
<s> I understand why the no-tagged production is useful when it contains a state token.  </s>
<s> Many distinct resources can be in the same state.  </s>
<s> I do not understand why this production can contain an etag.  </s>
<s> Unlike a state token, an etag can match at most one resource, and the only way a client could have an etag in the first place is by already knowing the resource.  </s>
<s> So it would always be possible for the client to use the tagged production.  </s>
<s> Can someone provide an example of when it would ever make sense to include an etag in such a production?  </s>
<s> The only reason I can think of is to allow the client to transmit slightly fewer bytes on the wire.  </s>
<s> I am not calling for any changes in the protocol or documentation, but would like to know whether I missed something.  </s>

<s> My interpretation of the No-tag-list production in an If header is that is is used for those cases where the condition (a list of state tokens and/or e-tags) applies to the (single) target resource of the request method, no other resource is effected.  </s>
<s> The Tagged-list production is for methods that effect more than one resource and therefore need to provide matching conditions for each.  </s>
<s> I could also probably come up with some fairly convoluted example where you could use an untagged If header with an e-tag on a Depth Infinity method but that would be besides the point.  </s>
<s> The real point is that we generally don't ban something unless we have a reason to.  </s>
<s> Since we didn't have a compelling reason to keep e-tags out of untagged lists and there is occasion that they could actually be useful in an untagged list, we decided to just allow them.  </s>
