<s> 1.  </s>
<s> All IETF drafts now require a patent statement a the top of the draft.  </s>
<s> Such as statement should be added to the document.  </s>
<s> 2. Example in section 2.0 should be a DSS example as this is the mandatory example.  </s>
<s> I assume that at some point this will be come a verifiable example as well.  </s>
<s> 3. Section 3.0 -- In the ATTLIST SignatureValue is misspelled.  </s>
<s> 4. Section 3.0 -- SignatureValue is no longer an empty-tag element.  </s>
<s> 5. Section 3.0 - Insert reference to Base64.  </s>
<s> 6. Based on input from mailing list -- please change c14nAlg as an element  </s>
<s> to fully spelled out.  </s>
<s> 7. Section 4.3.1 - I know that we were one of the people who wanted to make  </s>
<s> the location optional.  </s>
<s> What we had in mind was the following statement:  </s>
<s> "If the location is omitted, then the content being signed is the first  </s>
<s> Object in the immeadiate surrounding Signature."  </s>
<s> 8. Section 4.3.5 - This is no longer an empty-element tag.  </s>
<s> 9. Section 5.0 -- there are two DTD definitions for Object here.  </s>
<s> 10. Section 6.0 -- The DTD appears incorrect.  </s>
<s> ANY can only occur once and not with any of the current defined items.  </s>
<s> Should ANY be inside of the *?  </s>
<s> 11. Section 7.1 -- Please remove all references to MD5.  </s>
<s> We should not be pushing the older potentially bad hash algorithms (after all MD2 is not here either).  </s>
<s> SHA1 will cover our needs until the AES hash algorithm comes along  </s>
<s> 12. Please remove references to AES algorithms.  </s>
<s> There will be a block  </s>

<s> - Step 4 - space between SignedInfo/Element - Step 5 - references step d - Step f) - should be moved to step 6. 14.  </s>
<s> Section 8.2 - Step 6 - references steps c and d. - Remove last sentence of step 6 -- this would go to description of canonicazation.  </s>

<s> In IETF drafts, the open technical issues are usually a separate section at the end which you already have.  </s>
<s> Reading the "editorial comments" in the  </s>
<s> current draft, however, we find statements like "...However, these applications abuse the notion of the open Web model..." not appropriate to an IETF draft since they are clearly not technical.  </s>
<s> Also, "Security Comments" should go into the "Security Considerations" section.  </s>
<s> Finally, the formatting you're using for both (boxed) will not be carried into the IETF draft.  </s>
<s> We're sure you know that where they are placed now is within the body of the sections and would appear as normal descriptive text.  </s>

<s> When/where was this requirement added?  </s>
<s> None of my drafts have such a statement.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you mean copyright?  </s>
<s> I think the IESG is very close to requiring the ISOC copyright on all standards track drafts but, as far as I know, they have not actually done so yet...  </s>
<s> People wanted Signature spelled out and a few other things but I'm not sure about alg.  </s>
<s> Given that it is immediately followed by an "Alogrithm" attribute, it seem awefully redundant to spell it out.  </s>
<s> Do you mean "... in the element immediately surrounding the Signature."?  </s>
<s> I'd be interested in others input on this point.  </s>
<s> MD5 was traditionally the hash algorithm used in IETF protocols until SHA1 came along.  </s>
<s> Are there examples of IETF protocols with SHA1 but without MD5?  </s>
<s> I think there should be a note saying we expect these things to come along but not table entries for them.  </s>

<s> Based on further thought, I believe this was a reference to the standard boilerplate that says the draft conforms to RFC 2026.  </s>

<s> My worry is less about Alg than c14n.  </s>
<s> No, I mean the immeadiate surrounding Signature  </s>
<s> The location in the SigInfo references the object in the Signature block.  </s>
<s> Why do we even make that statement?  </s>
<s> We should just update the RFC when and if they come out.  </s>
<s> I see no benifits in saying it will be coming, there are a large number of things that I see as coming that are not listed.  </s>
<s> How does the fact they they are coming change this specification?  </s>
<s> Understood. However given these comments qualify text rather than merely identifying holes, I obviously prefer them to be in-line and in context.  </s>
<s> This is a very common convention amongst W3C WD's (see [1,2] for recent examples.) While rarer, it is not impossible to find within ietf-drafts [3,4].  </s>
<s> I do not believe this.  </s>
<s> I am trying to annotate sections that deserve particular technical attention so as to (1) identify issues such that the WG can come to clarity on what the actual issue is prior to finding an answer, (2) identify unstable text for external reviewers and (3) draw early attention to those areas that I think will prompt the Director's attention at one point or another: better early than late.  </s>
<s> Also, these comments serve a useful purpose in forging consensus in that people are more willing to agree to a proposal if their concerns are captured.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, people become stubborn and "vote" no-go instead of a go-with-caveat that can then be tested by time, implementation, and external review.  </s>
<s> If you feel this particular text (or any other) is not quite technical enough it is serving its purpose: I probably have not written it well.  </s>
<s> I am not speaking of open/closed content models for element nesting [6] but of the model in the context of Tim's Web model [7].  </s>
<s> I think what I am trying to capture is something similar to the "design regret" associated with XML1.0 IDREF in that IDREF only provides for inside-the-document linking.  </s>
<s> Consequently, my concern is that if we have a data model that permits parsers to pull out the relations between signatures and their referants, this type of feature if defined as syntactical optional will remain syntactically valid, but will break the data model parsers.  </s>
<s> Now I'm not exactly sure where everyone stood on this, so I added the text based on [8]  </s>
<s> text.  </s>
<s> Understood.  </s>
<s> However, I did not believe it to be misleading in the text version of the text document [5].  </s>
<s> After examining the way ietf-draft conventions, I believe capitalizing the "notes" will be even more effective.  </s>
<s> I will do this in the next version.  </s>

<s> While I don't think there should be idle chatter about the future, it is a matter of judgement how much motivational material there should be.  </s>
<s> Expecially if we drop MD5, saying we expect an AESH to come along provides a concrete motivation for hash algorithm variability in the protocol instead of just saying its always SHA1.  </s>
