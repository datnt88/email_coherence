<s> Our server has been working in the past with earlier implementations of Web Folders without a problem, however, when the client machine is upgraded to Office XP, a document that was accessible previously is now not found.  </s>
<s> I have tracked the problem down to the fact that Web Folders is encoding the URI value a second time before sending the request, which then causes it not to be found on our server.  </s>
<s> For example: In the folder listing we send back the following property: href /dav/webdav/%E8%E2temp%C9.xls /href  </s>
<s> Isn't this wrong in the first place?  </s>
<s> My understanding is that you should send URL-encoded UTF-8.  </s>
<s> Nope.  </s>
<s> The filename is in an "original character set".  </s>
<s> That is then encoded into  </s>
<s> octets for the URL.  </s>
<s> That transformation is not specified anywhere.  </s>
<s> Ideally,  </s>
<s> it is "original - UTF-8", but nobody says it must be.  </s>
<s> In fact, I would say  </s>
<s> it should match whatever encoding was used for the Request-URI (but that is not specified/defined in the request, so you're out of luck again).  </s>
<s> Once you have octets, then you perform the URL-escaping (using '%xx').  </s>
<s> After that, you need to transform the URL into the character set of the  </s>
<s> response body.  </s>
<s> That is usually UTF-8, but it is possible to have the XML in  </s>
<s> a different character set (provided it is specified on the Content-Type  </s>
<s> response header).  </s>
<s> Finally, you must XML-escape the UTF-8 characters of the URL you're  </s>
<s> inserting (e.g. translate '&amp;' to '&amp;amp;') so that you can embed the UTF-8 content into the XML response.  </s>
<s> A long time ago, I captured this as a start of a technical FAQ.  </s>

<s> Lisa, I think the only way we'll ever achieve interoperability for non-ASCII characters in resource names is to select one specific character encoding that needs to be used to map the characters to octets (which in turn then will get percent-escaped in the URL).  </s>
<s> Note that recipients of URLs have no way to find out which encoding was used, so we really need consensus here.  </s>
<s> The big issue is that the current RFCs do not say anything normative about the issue.  </s>
<s> Therefore, in practice URLs do exists which -- after percent-de-escaping -- can not be decoded as UTF-8, and these URLs are fully legal URLs according to RFC2396.  </s>
<s> So my proposal is to add a SHOULD level requirement for generating URL path segments from names that do contain non-ASCII characters, such as filenames in a file system: RFC2396bis currently says [1]: "When a URI scheme defines a component that represents textual data consisting of characters from the Unicode (ISO 10646) character set, we recommend that the data be encoded first as octets according to the UTF-8 [UTF-8] character encoding, and then escaping only those octets that are not in the unreserved character set."  </s>
<s> So we'd be in sync with the latest URI draft, accept we would make it a SHOULD for WebDAV.  </s>
