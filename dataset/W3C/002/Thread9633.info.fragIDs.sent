Latest version of the datatype summary document now available at incorporating ideas arising from discussions with Patrick S. (rdfs:drange and especially section 10). 
Note to WG: this version has NOT yet been OK'd by others (Patrick S, Sergey, Graham, Jeremy, Jos) and so should be considered basis for discussion rather than final offering. 
Changes from version 2 noted by tasteful use of decorator colors.

I would like to "go round the table" of the WG on the latest datatype proposal. 
By go round the table, I mean to solicit the views of each member of the WG, without initiating a debate on members views. 
We can then summarize those views and deal with issues arising. 
Please answer the following questions: o Does the datatyping proposal meet your needs and the needs of your users? 
(Who are they?) (What is missing?) o Are there features that could be dropped and still meet the needs of your users? 
(Which?) 
o Does the proposal 'work for you'? 
o Are there any concerns with the proposal you would like to raise? 
(What are they?)

Almost (there's nothing critical missing really, but...) I think that the adoption of the union interpretation of rdfs:drange and the addition of one more range property rdfs:lrange to constrain property values only to the lexical space of a datatype, would be desireable -- because it allows for the use of the inline (S-B) idiom as a datatyping idiom, and thus provides both for better backwards compatability with present usage as well as for the most intuitive, basic idiom to be retained and used for datatyping. 
The datatype triples idiom. 
Though it's OK to keep it. 
Yes. 
Though the union interpretation of rdfs:drange and addition of rdfs:lrange round things out nicely and would be a better final solution. 
Nothing major.
