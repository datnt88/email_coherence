<s> I can't help thinking that the link to the errata page is often a little hidden at the bottom of the status section, and yet the errata may contain important information.  </s>

<s> I haven't seen anyone on spec-prod complain, and if someone really cares about the production of specs, they should be on this mailing list.  </s>
<s> Unless someone on spec-prod speaks up soon, let's make this change to Susan's document, ask Norm to make the necessary change to xmlspec, and be done with it.  </s>

<s> There are some outstanding additions that would be useful for the mathml spec as well (relating mainly to inline graphics, if I recall).  </s>
<s> If it would be useful I'll try to generate a list of things we added (this isn't entirely trivial as mathml is an extended version of xmlspec version 1 and most of the features got added in version 2 but not necessarily with the same syntax, but I'd like to get the sources back as far as possible to the current xmlspec, just in case we ever get the urge to do a mathml3.)

<s> I have to admit that I've fallen down on the job; I've been meaning to do a comprehensive XMLspec update for at least a year now.  </s>
<s> I've collected a ton of RFEs, and was thinking about doing a backwards-compatible minor update (to V2.2) before considering any of the backwards-*in*compatible options (which would require a V3.0).  </s>
<s> At the same time, I've been feeling like XMLspec was already going in the direction of being a "kitchen sink" DTD -- it's really hard to decide *not* to add features, so it grows.  </s>
<s> A V2.2 might exacerbate the problem, so it's probably a good time to re-examine our premises about what it should be.  </s>
<s> Philippe brings up the idea of possibly merging DocBook and XMLspec.  </s>
<s> I think this would be a very worthwhile discussion, even if the result is to make them much more loosely coupled (e.g. an XMLspec hierarchy/metadata module vs. a DocBook hierarchy/metadata module on top of a DocBook-like information pool?).  </s>
<s> In a separate message I'll send out my current list of XMLspec RFEs...  </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure it's not complete, but it should cover about a year's worth of requests.  </s>
