<s> Addressing ACTION: 2001-08-24#8 Dave Beckett Write up a proposed resolution for reifying using XML attributes anly (sic) The RDF XML syntax defined in M&amp;S allows properties to be written as XML attributes in the Qname form, with values that are strings.  </s>
<s> These are then turned into RDF statements with a string object.  </s>
<s> The syntax also allows the rdf:type property to be used as an attribute with the string value interpreted as a URI-reference.  </s>
<s> M&amp;S defines explicitly other properties including rdf:subject, rdf:predicate and rdf:object In summary, these take as values: Property Property Value rdf:type URI-reference rdf:subject URI-reference rdf:predicate URI-reference rdf:object URI-reference or literal  </s>
<s> These can be used in this attribute abbreviated form since they match the grammar propAttr or typeAttr (for rdf:type).  </s>
<s> Testing the attached example with parser implementations gives different results for the statement values - some literals, some URI-references.  </s>
<s> Thus, we need to clarify what is allowed here.  </s>
<s> Proposed clarification / resolution, test case.  </s>
<s> For properties encoded in XML attribute form, the attribute value is interpreted as a literal for all properties except rdf:type for which it is interpreted as a URI-reference.  </s>
<s> The attached N-Triples defines the model produced by the attached RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> Consequences: rdf:subject and rdf:predicate if used in XML attribute form will generate literal values which are presently forbidden (I think!)  </s>
<s> or maybe just very unexpected.  </s>
<s> If you want to use rdf:subject, rdf:predicate properties, encode them in the property element form (propElt).  </s>
<s> rdf:object can be used but can only take a literal value.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Umm...  </s>
<s> I'm running into the same sort of use/mention issues here as are all over the RDF 1.0 spec.  </s>
<s> The fact that both XML attributes and RDF properties have values is one source of confusion.  </s>
<s> The values/objects of statements whose predicate is rdf:type are not constrained at all, as far as I know, let alone being constrained to a URI-reference.  </s>
<s> i.e. it's not the case that rdf:type rdfs:range xmlschema-datatype:URI-reference.  </s>
<s> right?  </s>
<s> But no matter... the test case you give is clear enough...  </s>
<s> I'm not a big fan of this exception.  </s>
<s> While we're cleaning up this mess, I suggest we get rid of it.  </s>
<s> I think not.  </s>
<s> They might not make much sense, but they're not forbidden.  </s>
<s> quite possibly.  </s>
<s> Yup. rdf:type too, I suggest.  </s>
<s> I suggest the expected results are: _:id1 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Statement" .  </s>
<s> _:id1 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#subject "http://example.com/resource" .  </s>
<s> _:id1 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#predicate "http://example.com/predicate" .  </s>
<s> _:id1 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#object "literal" .  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Since Dave and DanC seem to be in agreement wrt the resulting N-Triples, is anyone aware of implementations that differ from this interpretation?  </s>
<s> [FWIW, this output matches the ARP and SiRPAC parsers.]  </s>
<s> Art Barstow said:  </s>
<s> No, Dan changed rdf:type to take a literal value which is a change beyond what we can justify as a cleanup just because it makes the grammar slightly neater, IMHO.  </s>
<s> The first triple in my original N-Triple output was _:id1 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Statement .  </s>
<s> The original grammar is pretty clear on this point, it intended rdf:type to take a URI-reference.  </s>
<s> rdf:type may also match propAttr but the rdf:type property has a privileged position in the syntax such as its generation from typedNode and this is another place.  </s>
<s> [6.10] propAttr ::= typeAttr  </s>
<s> propName '="' string '"' (with embedded quotes escaped)  </s>
<s> [6.11] typeAttr ::= ' type="' URI-reference '"' [6.14] propName ::= Qname [6.19] Qname ::= [ NSprefix ':' ] name -- http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#propAttr onwards (plus modifying type to be rdf:type as we have already decided) Dave  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly said:  </s>
<s> I would say no.  </s>
<s> I am describing the RDF/XML syntax as described in RDF M&amp;S which does not require or use RDF Schema or XML Schema.  </s>
<s> The restrictions is on how the rdf:type property is used in the syntax as an XML attribute.  </s>
<s> This is mostly done in the grammar EBNF.  </s>
<s> The syntax references I pointed out in: Note: This is about the use of rdf:type as an attribute in *this* XML syntax.  </s>
<s> It does not restrict what rdf:type can point to in the model or of course, anything in other syntaxes.  </s>
<s> Although, for all uses I can remember in RDF/XML rdf:type is used with a URI-reference, the following is perfectly legal RDF/XML: and generates http://example.org/  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type "literal" .  </s>
<s> No. This part of the syntax has a legitimate use and is not too difficult to work out what the grammar meant.  </s>
<s> We should not just throw out syntax with no good reason.  </s>
<s> After emailing that, I changed my mind on illegal - unspecified would be better.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
