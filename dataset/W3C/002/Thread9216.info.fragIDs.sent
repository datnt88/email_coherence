This issue seems to be a simple misunderstanding. 
As explained in a reply by Brian McBride[1] the spec clearly states that the composition function is simple concatenation. 
I see no issue here. 
Can we just take it off the list? 
Or is there something I'm missing?

Likewise, myself. 
It feels a little untidy, but I can't see that it's broken.

Hi Aaron, If what you suggest is correct, then this issue should be quickly resolved when it is scheduled.
