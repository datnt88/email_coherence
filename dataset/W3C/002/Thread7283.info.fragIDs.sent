<s> You can't 'destroy' a URI.  </s>
<s> You can ask to have a resource destroyed,  </s>
<s> and the argument is the URI.  </s>
<s> The HTTP committee struggled mightily with the terminology about resource/entity/variant, and came up with a set of definitions that I hope you adopt rather than reinterpret.  </s>
<s> But it's important to be clear about what the operations operate on.  </s>
<s> I _think_ that all of the operations apply to a resource, not to a URI which identifies a resource.  </s>
<s> It is with some great difficulty tthat you will have to clarify whether versioning actually applies to content-negotiated resources (e.g., same URL but different renditions.) Do the 'attributes' apply to the resource, to the variant, to the version, or to some combination of them?  </s>
<s> Why is the PEP draft mentioned in the references?  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> That's what I'm saying as well.  </s>
<s> The bottom line is: if both the client and the server need to refer to the same thing, give it a name (i.e. a URL) and consider it a resource.  </s>
<s> This is one reason why early attempts to "solve" the versioning problem ended up tied in knots.  </s>
<s> If you decide that everything  </s>
<s> has a URI and that the URI is all that is needed to retrieve a  </s>
<s> resource its not possible to provide versioning through lexical  </s>
<s> properties of the URIs.  </s>
<s> Ie one cannot create a convention that  </s>
<s> I agree with Dan that we have to name everything and keep to the  </s>
<s> principle of only using one typr of URI rather than attempt  </s>
<s> to create ad hoc accessors for "versions" of a URI.  </s>
<s> What we have is not a resource with many versions but a collection of resources and a collection of assertions stating which resources are earlier variant of others.  </s>
<s> Ie if we take the "fred" resource we may have the following URIs :- FredThe resource itself, the operation GET("Fred",t) returns the current value of Fred, the Fred of time t.  </s>
<s> It is the "essence" of Fredishness.  </s>
<s> Fred.v1Fred version 1, A Fred that is known to be immutable in time.  </s>
<s> GET("Fred.v1", t) returns the same value for all values of t.  </s>
<s> This value can be cached since it cannot change by definition.  </s>
<s> Fred.v2Fred version 2, see above.  </s>
<s> The advantage of separating the assertions from the resources is that we then have a scheme in which we can move the assertions about in lieu of objects.  </s>
<s> If we want to synchronise two repositories we can do so by first exchanging the assertions as to which fred versions have changed.  </s>
<s> The other key advantage of this approach is that because we have not relied on particular lexical properties of the labels (ie convention fred;3 fred;4 are versions 3,4 of fred) we can go to offline distributed authoring and make it work.  </s>
<s> Consider the following scenario.  </s>
<s> I have two machines, a laptop and a desk machine.  </s>
<s> I work on projects on both machines, the two machines are only briefly in communication with each other so we have a continuing problem of synchronising two databases.  </s>
<s> I'm using this example because I think it gets to the core of what is hard in the distributed authoring problem.  </s>
<s> If we can solve this problem in a principled manner I think we can do the collaborative, multi-author one as well.  </s>
<s> I also think that it is the key to making the Network computer something that would be an advance on our current systems rather than an Oracle/IBM big systems, MIS centric disaster.  </s>
<s> There is a reason why the world has gone to Microsoft and some people just "don't get it", but thats a digression.  </s>
<s> The rules for the laptop/desktop scenario are as follows:- 1) If compatible changes in the two databases are made the system synchronises transparently.  </s>
<s> 2) If there are collisions the system responds with a semantic level merger of the two systems.  </s>
<s> By "semantic" level I mean that the merger cannot be the CVS style lexical kludge.  </s>
<s> The merger process must exploit structure or else it is all hopeless.  </s>
<s> To make this work I think we need to consider carefully the nature of hypertext structure.  </s>
<s> I believe that hypertext has structure in the broad scale that is as "cliched" as ordinary text but is beyond merely headings, paragraphs etc.  </s>
<s> For example where there is a list of objects there is probably a need for a cliche which allows that list to be extended.  </s>
<s> Anyone who has done requirements engineering will be familliar with a structure of text in which requirements and architecture have to be mutually cross linked.  </s>
<s> The generation of tables of authorities, crossindexing and cross referencing is all part of this structure.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> I think there's a design choice people are facing in trying to reconcile versioning and content negotiation, and I want to argue for one choice over another:  </s>
<s> I have some metapoints on the draft and how it relates to HTTP that I don't think have been raised.  </s>
<s> It took a long time before we got the terminology right in HTTP and without  </s>
<s> doubt this caused the final specification to be delayed for some time.  </s>
<s> The lesson to learn from this is that not having the basics right leads to major problems later on.  </s>
<s> There were a couple of terminology issues that were not realized in the  </s>
<s> HTTP work before very late in the process.  </s>
<s> They may seem to be evident but let me recap them for a moment: 1) A resource is identified by a URL.  </s>
<s> That is, no resource exists outside the URL name space and only resources are accessible through the Web. 2) HTTP transports entities - not resources.  </s>
<s> An HTTP method performs an operation on the resource which in the classic case of "GET" generates a snapshot of what the resource looks like to this particular request.  </s>
<s> Luckily, many requests are very similar and hence the result of a method can often be cached and reused by other clients.  </s>
<s> Note, however, that an entity does not have a URL and hence is not a resource!  </s>
<s> The entity tag or the date can be used by a client to verify that the cached entry is still valid in the sense that it still resembles the result produced by the resource when poked with a similar request.  </s>
<s> 3) All entities in a HTTP response may be subject to content negotiation.  </s>
<s> This includes error messages, redirections, and any other entity type.  </s>
<s> Content negotiation is not limited to "200 OK" responses.  </s>
<s> The server MUST use the vary header to indicate that the entity was negotiated as a function of the request.  </s>
<s> The server may use the Content-Location header to indicate the exact location of the resource corresponding to a particular entity at the time of the request.  </s>
<s> 4) A resource does not move from the origin server.  </s>
<s> Unlike mail where the message is moved around on the Net, a resource stays on the origin server at all times.  </s>
<s> When a client creates a new entity, it includes an entity in the request and asks the server to create a resource with the initial contents being the entity.  </s>
<s> So what does this mean to distributed authoring?  </s>
<s> I think the two main points are: A) Distributed authoring is about editing/creating resources - not entities!  </s>
<s> This is in fact the root of the "editing the source" problem which I haven't seen discussed in the draft (unless I have missed something).  </s>
<s> If the resource is a plain HTML file, then there is no difference between the resource and the entity included in the HTTP response - they contain exactly the same bytes.  </s>
<s> In other words - good old file system semantics hold true and the entity can be edited directly.  </s>
<s> However, if the resource represents dynamic contents, a data base view, a CGI script or a server side include then what you GET is not identical to the resource.  </s>
<s> In this situation, file system semantics break down and the entity can in general not be edited directly.  </s>
<s> B) Content negotiation is not a problem.  </s>
<s> The client can always see if the entity has been negotiated or not.  </s>
<s> If the server provided it with a Content-Location header it can use that when issuing a PUT request (libwww uses this) and if not then it relies on the server to pick the right location based on the entity tag.  </s>
<s> The immediate solution to problem A) is to have two different methods for viewing (GET) and editing (EDIT).  </s>
<s> However, this requires you always to explicitly contacting the server in order to edit a document.  </s>
<s> Hence, off-line editing becomes very hard.  </s>
<s> Also, in all the "plain HTML" cases, having different methods add extra overhead even though there is no difference between the result of the two methods.  </s>
<s> New methods also have the problem that they don't pass old proxies very well.  </s>
<s> Another solution is to have the server indicating when file system semantics do not hold true.  </s>
<s> In order to avoid a new method this can be done by adding a "Link" header to the response indicating the location where the client can get the resource itself and not the entity generated as a response to a GET request.  </s>
<s> In the case of a data base entry, this can be a HTML form for entering/editing data, and in the case of a CGI script or server side include (SSI), this is where the client can get the CGI program or the unparsed SSI file.  </s>
<s> An example: GET /dynamic/contents.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: CGI-server HTTP/1.1 200 OK Link: source.cgi;  </s>
<s> rel="source" etc.  </s>
<s> In this examppe, the link URL is relative to the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> It can of course also be pointing to another server as any other URL.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Henrik  </s>
<s> Since HTTP/1.1 allows GET with a body, why not use something like  </s>
<s> GET URI HTTP/1.1  </s>
<s> Document-Author: ID Want-Source: yes Authors-Credentials: whatever Version-Number: 4  </s>
<s> to retrieve a specific version (given proper credentials, of course, to prevent general users from retrieving old versions).  </s>
<s> Alternatively, a new method could be introduced like SGET to get source minus server side includes etc., but that's an issue for another message.  </s>

<s> Because it completely destroys the idea of being able to link to an arbitrary document from an arbitrary HTML page using a single URI.  </s>
<s> Schemes such as this require all the clients to be rewritten and promote the obsolete hypertext model the Web replaced.  </s>
<s> The key advance of the web was to do away with the need for special editors, convoluted document repositories etc.  </s>
<s> If information is an accessor for a document it bellongs in the URI, otherwise it does not.  </s>
<s> The most that could be done with URIs at a lexical level would be to provide an assertion that the URI conformed to a lexical convention concerning version numbers.  </s>
<s> If we are going to support collaborative authoring it better support divergent versions and at least a hierarchical organisation of the version resources.  </s>
<s> Another point, we need to consider the definition of "set" objects, analogous to the old CMS classes and Groups.  </s>

<s> A Class was a collection of  </s>
<s> particular variants of a resource.  </s>
<s> To make a release one would  </s>
<s> create a class with the versions of the resources used to make that release. the groups were used simply to collect resources together into handy units.  </s>

<s> As anyone who has coded LISP will know files are not a usefull grouping for program objects.  </s>
<s> Indeed there is no single such grouping.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> I guess this depends on the role you expect document versioning to play in the first place.  </s>
<s> If you intend that versions 1 and 2 of the same document should co-exisxt and poth should potentially be available to end users, then you are right: each should ahve its own URI.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if only one version should be available to to end users and old versions exist primarily for contnent developers, then I am not convinced.  </s>
<s> This is a matter for access control, surely?  </s>
<s> Why invent a new scheme when we already have a perfectly good one?  </s>
<s> Don't forget that content developers are just end users with extra privilege.  </s>
<s> I guess I have not bewen viewing multiple versions of a document as separate resources, and have therefore seen the version slection process to be essentially analogous to content negotiation.  </s>
<s> This may be a faulty assumption.  </s>
<s> But consider tht if a resource has variants, those variants MAY have their own URIs.  </s>
<s> It is not required.  </s>
<s> But if they don't have their own URIs you may not be able to determine how to select them.  </s>
<s> Certainly not without new headers.  </s>
<s> I like this idea.  </s>
<s> If version numbers are totally ordered then it is not possible to have parallel development of separate versions.  </s>
<s> Of course, unless parallel development paths are ordered then there is no concept of current version.  </s>
<s> To expand the URL/parallel version model, you could do things like: the file a "user" gets version 1.2.3.4 of somefile (possibly including tagging information for version tracking) a list of versions the latest version of somefile with version tagging  </s>

<s> Yaron responded:  </s>

<s> The draft already allows for this.  </s>
<s> But actually, I meant to make a stronger case that you should NOT try to support choice (b): that is, don't try to allow for 'versioning' to apply to resources that don't have URLs.  </s>
<s> The reason that you shouldn't  </s>
<s> is that you'll have to invent some way of referring to the thing-that-is-versioned in order to talk about the version of it that you want, and that doing so will be hard, and you'll wind up with something that looks enough like a URL in the first place that you might as well have just required there to be a URL anyway.  </s>
<s> The primary reason why content negotiation ALLOWS for multiple representations without specific URLs for each of those representations is to support those situations where the representation is computed on-the-fly, e.g., different charset encodings (EUC, Shift-JIS) of the same Japanese document, different image representations (GIF, PNG, JPEG) of the same original image, or just different pages constructed on the fly from a database.  </s>
<s> I'd claim that in all of those situations, 'versioning' will not apply to the individual representations anyway.  </s>
<s> Are there any situations you can imagine or explain where the versioned representations don't conveniently have URLs but should be versioned independently?  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> A representation (or entity -- same thing) is immutable, the way integers and URLs are immutable.  </s>
<s> How many versions of the number 2 or the string "http://www.w3.org/" are there?  </s>
<s> Well, a 'representation' isn't exactly the 'same thing' as an entity.  </s>
<s> We're working in an area where there aren't enough precise terms.  </s>
<s> It's very risky to try to make a 'plain logic' argument where we're primarily having difficulty with definitions of terms.  </s>
<s> Let's try this out along a different dimension than content negotiation: HTTP supports 'range retrieval' as well as content negotiation.  </s>
<s> Let's suppose that we allow range retrieval for 'pages' out of a single multi-page resource: request: Range: pages=1,2 without giving separate URLs for each page independently.  </s>
<s> There's one URL: but I can either retrieve the whole thing or several pages at a time.  </s>
<s> One might imagine wanting to 'version' the pages independently, e.g., "version 12 of page 7" and "version 9 of page 12" and even have some way of saying "version 10 of the chapter consists of version 23 of page 1, ... version 12 of page 7 ... version 9 of page 12 ....".  </s>
<s> This isn't logically inconsistent, it's just implementationally difficult.  </s>
<s> At least in the context of versioning, the part/whole relationship bears a strong resemblance to the representation/resource relationship.  </s>

<s> Look at it as a big base-256 integer.  </s>
<s> It's still an integer, just like 2. No state.  </s>
<s> No changes.  </s>
<s> No versions.  </s>
<s> A resource, on the other hand, has state, attributes, related resources (i.e. linked resources, or variants, or versions, ...) etc.  </s>

<s> It makes perfect sense for an origin server to say (or for anybody to claim, for that matter) that: is the URL for a resource that represents version 1.2 of the resource at: But it makes no sense to say that the representation: Content-Type: text/plan abc is version 1.2 of the representation: Content-Type: text/plan def any more than it makes sense to say that the number 4 is version 1.2 of the number 2.
