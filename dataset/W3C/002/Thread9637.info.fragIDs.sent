<s> Hey folks, Here's an excercise for those of us who think we fully grok the convergence datatyping proposal ;-) I would like to use the following use cases to clarify exactly what is meant by the various *range constraint properties used by the convergence datatyping proposal.  </s>
<s> I hope this will ensure that we all actually do understand the convergence proposal the same way ;-) Some of these may be "impossible" or "badly formed" cases, or trivial variants of others, and if so, I'd like it to be stated why.  </s>
<s> I've used rdf:lform rather than rdf:value, to avoid  </s>
<s> any influence from existing presumptions about what rdf:value means.  </s>
<s> rdf:lform can be taken to have a range of "lexical form" (member of lexical space) and a domain of "data value" (member of value space) for some datatype.  </s>
<s> Each example should be considered in isolation, the bnodes are not shared between examples and the only other information that can be applied is that provided by the MT, closure rules, etc.  </s>
<s> Specific questions: a) what is the range constraint -- value space, lexical space, both?  </s>
<s> b) what does each bNode, if any, denote?  </s>
<s> c) is there enough information to recognize datatypes?  </s>
<s> d) is there enough information to execute a datatyping mapping to a value?  </s>

<s> a) the value space of xsd:date b) some member of the value space of xsd:date c) no d) no, we do not know what lexical space the literal belongs to, and the rdfs:range constraint say's nothing about lexical representation, only about value spaces  </s>

<s> Continue having a nice weekend ;-) Patrick  </s>
<s> In case it isn't clear to some why the bNode denotes the lexical space of xsd:date, it should be pointed out that this follows from the dual nature of datatype properties and the fact that xsd:date is a subproperty of rdf:lform and rdf:lform has an implicit range of the lexical space of a datatype.  </s>
<s> Thus, from the first triple, we know xsd:date is a datatype class.  </s>
<s> From the second triple we know its range is its own lexical space.  </s>
<s> From the third and fourth triple we see that it shares the same range as dc:date, and thus the range of dc:date is the lexical space of xsd:date.  </s>
<s> And from the last triple we know that the literal is a member of the lexical space of xsd:date and thus, we can determine the TDL pairing.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> OK, I guess.  </s>
<s> But then why not use the rdfd: namespace idea?  </s>
<s> That would make things easier for people, seems to me, since they could very quickly see whether or not datatype magic was being utilized, and we could isolate the 'special' aspects of the MT to a distinct namespace, which I like on aesthetic grounds.  </s>
<s> In any case, can we please get this sorted out, as it is a pain in the anatomy to have to re-draw the diagrams just to change the vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> I prefer rdfs: as well, and it will give the datatyping vocabulary, I think, more "prominence" or "authority" to be within the RDFS namespace rather than somewhere else.  </s>
