<s> I have never formally made a comment about RFC2518's DAV: URI space but I do now.  </s>
<s> I only recently noticed that it invents two completely new URIabuse one of the weakest points of the web, the flat highest level space of URI schemes.  </s>
<s> The URI scheme name if the root of the URI system, and DNS's TLDs being some way below it.  </s>
<s> Imagine the fuss there would have been if WebDAV had introduced a TLD!  </s>
<s> This is a little like introducing an amendment to the constitution to allow change the admission to town museums.  </s>
<s> It is being done at entirely the wrong level.  </s>
<s> I am quite appalled at this abuse of URIspace, and schemes.  </s>
<s> It is quite inappropriate for a specification to am inclined to suggest that the specification be updated to use a URI which the working group has in its power to allocate (such as http://www.w3.org/2001/dav or http://www.ietf.org/2001/dav)  </s>
<s> This would entail all code being rewritten over time to accept first both and then only this space.  </s>
<s> The tedious process of cleaning up this debris in the web's front hall should begin now.  </s>
<s> Looking at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/url-schemes we find that there is *another* space reserved: opaquelocktoken At least this is a real space of identifiers.  </s>
<s> It would be preferable as a question of overall architecture to make this a separate specification, as it is quite general uuid: with knobs on.  </s>
<s> In fact, as there is no spec linking ISO-11578 UUIDs to the uuid: scheme registered with IANA.  </s>
<s> There should, in my opinion, be such a specification.  </s>
<s> There is a fundamental mistake that the URI scheme which is very general is being specified as only applying to a particular class of object.  </s>
<s> opaquelocktoken: would be quire reusable as a piece of technology if it didn't have such an unnecessary restriction.  </s>
<s> I would like to suggest in the future that any new URI scheme be resisted by W3C TAG and IESG unless there really is a new space with new well defined properties being defined.  </s>
<s> It should then be put through a review by IETF and W3C at least, at the start of the design process.  </s>

<s> I don't think anyone would dispute that the "DAV:" hack should be fixed in the next version of RFC2518.  </s>
<s> Now that XML namespaces are stabilized, there is no excuse for non-compliance in the way the DAV namespace is defined.  </s>
<s> I assume that Jim has this on his list of to-dos.  </s>
<s> Jim?  </s>
<s> Hi, it's easy to agree that the namespaceUri was badly chosen -- however I really don't see all servers and clients being converted to support two namespace names.  </s>
<s> Couldn't this be "fixed" easier by registering "DAV:" as an URI scheme (looking at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/url-schemes , it's listed already...).  </s>
