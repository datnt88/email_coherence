<s> Well, To begin with 99.9% of the target users don't see a difference between a Java card and a mobile phone in terms of "proprietary".  </s>
<s> They do however note that the so called "standard PKI card" has zero built-in support in their Windows system, unlike the mobile phone thing that has it as pre-install.  </s>
<s> They also get painfully aware that Dell and many other leading PC manufacturers do not even carry card readers as options, while the WLAN thing is built-in.  </s>
<s> For e-governments and on-line banks, a $50 cost reduction(card + reader + software + support) per customer is welcomed.  </s>
<s> The card vendors have had ample of time to launch a truly standard card including free software, but they didn't.  </s>
<s> Now it is "harvest time" :-) Anders "why would you ever want a smart ID card that only supports a fraction of the other device's ID-related use-cases?"  </s>
