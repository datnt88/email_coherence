<s> At IETF 42, the question was raised: What is the rationale for allowing only one change to an ordering per ORDERPATCH request?  </s>
<s> I believe that the rationale for this decision was that there may be existing DMSs that support only single changes per request, and that we should not require them to change in order to be compliant with the Ordering part of the Advanced Collections specification.  </s>
<s> We can certainly change this position if the consensus of the group is that it is too restrictive.  </s>
<s> An intermediate position might be that we define the ORDERPATCH request to support multiple changes per request, but don't require servers to accept requests with more than one change.  </s>

<s> In fact, since WebDAV servers support locking a collection (to implement LOCK), a DAV layer could lock the collection, then perform multiple individual order change operations, then unlock the collection.  </s>
<s> It might be difficult to implement all-or-nothing semantics with this approach (i.e., perform all these order changes or perform none of the order changes), which is why I suggest making the semantics best effort.  </s>

<s> Right--and (IMHO) this would be much better than forcing the clients to do it instead.  </s>
<s> The server can fake it more efficiently than the client can (if the client has to issue one ORDERPATCH per change), and some servers won't have to fake it at all.  </s>
