<s> Section 9 of the draft attempts to tackle the problem of how to differentiate the behavior of a resource based on its bindings.  </s>
<s> It attempts to discuss the difference between a static and non-static resource.  </s>
<s> However the difference between these two types of resources is so unbelievably arbitrary that I fail to see how attempting to differentiate between them enhances interoperability.  </s>
<s> For example, let us pretend we have the CurrentURI property.  </s>
<s> The value of the property will be the Request-URI of the PROPFIND method used to retrieve the value of the CurrentURI property.  </s>
<s> Now let us pretend we have two servers, A and B. A runs a version of WebDAV that automatically generates the CurrentURI property on top of whatever resources it supports.  </s>
<s> What this means is that even if the underlying data store where the resource is recorded doesn't know about the CurrentURI property, I can still get the CurrentURI property through PROPFIND because A's server will intercept the PROPFIND and insert the data itself.  </s>
<s> Server B doesn't support CurrentURI at all.  </s>
<s> I now have a resource R that has bindings into A and B. This means that if I ask for the CurrentURI property through the binding on A, I will get a result with the URI on A. If I ask for the CurrentURI property through the binding on B, I will not even see the property at all.  </s>
<s> So the question is - Well is this a dynamic resource?  </s>
<s> Is it not?  </s>
<s> Can I have the same resourceID on both URIs in this example?  </s>
<s> How does the language in section 9 help me deal with this?  </s>
<s> Does it actually clarify anything in a useful way?  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell the language in section 9 is just motherhood and apple pie language and that always makes for bad standard language.  </s>
<s> Therefore I move that all the paragraphs in section 9 but the first paragraph be stricken from the BIND spec.  </s>
<s> The first paragraph doesn't really say anything substantive.  </s>
<s> It just introduces the section, listing the methods to which it applies.  </s>
<s> The one substantive statement that I think we would want to keep is "For these methods, no new complexities are introduced by allowing explicit creation of multiple bindings to the same resource."  </s>
<s> I could be persuaded to reduce the section to just that.  </s>
<s> But it still might be worth pointing out that BIND will make it much more common to have multiple bindings to the same resource (even though that was always possible).  </s>
<s> And when there are multiple bindings to a resource, it is possible for a resource's behavior in response to GET, HEAD, PROPFIND, etc., to be sensitive to the URI that was used to make the request.  </s>
<s> Maybe we wouldn't have to discuss the distinction between static and dynamic resources in order to make that point.  </s>

<s> I agree that we want to keep the sentence you identified below.  </s>
<s> I also agree that we want to address the issue of a resource acting differently based on the URI it is addressed from.  </s>
<s> I suspect my problem with the language in the section derives from the differentiation made between static and dynamic resources.  </s>
<s> In my experience one can not really make the distinction because even if a "resource" is just a file in a file system, there is always a server on top of it that may or may not alter its presentation.  </s>
<s> If the language in section 9 were to be re-written with the assumption that ALL resources are dynamic then I suspect we would find the resulting language mutually acceptable.  </s>
<s> In other words, we should remove the terms dynamic/static completely and instead talk about resources and the fact that their presentation can change based solely on what URI they are accessed from.  </s>
<s> We shouldn't even try to address the fact that in some cases, some resources for some period of time may choose to look identical regardless of what URI they are accessed from.  </s>

<s> I agree that there is a perspective that there are no truly static resources in the world, but if we get hung up on that, we're verging on a meta-physical discussion that will distract from the point of this section.  </s>
<s> And if we tried to write something that works for all dynamic resources, there truly wouldn't be anything meaningful said in that section.  </s>
<s> That section is very readable right now and does a good job of conveying a fuzzy concept/behavior: There are a range of resources.  </s>
<s> From the ideal static resource to the most dynamic resource you could imagine.  </s>
<s> One will probably never encounter a resource at either extreme.  </s>
<s> Where a given resource lies between these two extremes is in the eyes of the beholder... but the platonic ideal of a static resource acts in this fashion...  </s>
<s> That being said, feel free to write up a new version of that section, but please don't get overly distracted trying to convey the fact the the nominal "static resource" is only an ideal.  </s>
<s> I do feel if one's focus is too much on that, they will write something less effective than the current text.  </s>
<s> As I said, the current text seems to do a good job conveying a fuzzy topic.  </s>
<s> Here's some text that doesn't mention static / dynamic.  </s>
<s> It doesn't make the simple, idealized statement that we wanted for static resources, but maybe it says enough to be useful: "This section describes the interaction of bindings with those HTTP methods not yet explicitly discussed.  </s>
<s> The semantics of the methods GET, HEAD, PUT, POST and OPTIONS are specified in [HTTP].  </s>
<s> The semantics of PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, and MKCOL are specified in [WebDAV].  </s>
<s> "For these methods, no new complexities are introduced by allowing explicit creation of multiple bindings to the same resource.  </s>
<s> However, the introduction of the BIND method will make it more common for multiple URIs to map to the same resource.  </s>
<s> As a result, the introduction of the BIND method may point up complexities that were already possible, but occurred only rarely in the past.  </s>
<s> "In particular, when there are multiple URI mappings to the same resource, it is possible for the resource's behavior in response to GET, HEAD, PROPFIND, etc., to be sensitive to the URI that was used to make the request.  </s>
<s> For example, the Request-URI may appear in the response entity body for GET on a particular resource, in which case the response entity body produced by that resource will differ depending upon which URI was used to make the request.  </s>
<s> "The only way for a client to determine whether two URIs map to the same resource is by retrieving and comparing the DAV:resourceid property defined in the following section."  </s>
<s> Or we could keep the current text, but add some remarks about the static / dynamic distinction, along the lines that Jason suggests: "This section describes the interaction of bindings with those HTTP methods not yet explicitly discussed.  </s>

<s> However, the introduction of the BIND method will make it more common for multiple URIs to map to the same resource.  </s>
<s> When these methods are applied to the same resource using different Request-URIs, the rules for their behavior depend upon whether the resource is static or dynamic.  </s>
<s> "A static resource is one that always produces the same response to the same method with identiical parameters.  </s>
<s> "A dynamic resource is one that may produce different responses for different submissions of the same method with identical parameters.  </s>
<s> "In reality, a single resource may respond statically to some requests, but dynamically to others.  </s>
<s> However, for a pure static resource, these methods obey the folowing rule: "o A method submitted through one URI mapping, on success, MUST produce the same results as the same method, with the same headers and entity body, submitted through any other URI mapping to the same resource.  </s>
<s> "When applied to dynamic resources, it is not possible to state any such rule.  </s>
