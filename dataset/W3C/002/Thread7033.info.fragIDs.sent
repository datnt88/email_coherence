<s> [ I've cc:d uri@w3.org because I suspect there may be more diversity of input there, but have set replies to www-talk@w3.org, as this is probably out of scope for discussion on the URI list.  </s>
<s> ] I've been reading through most of the fun little brawl that happened on uri@w3.org in July when catching up on my mail (yes, I'm behind).  </s>
<s> It seems to me that there are two possible views of the relationship between URIs and their associated resources;  </s>
<s> * Many-to-One - that is, it's possible for many URIs to identify the same resource.  </s>
<s> In this view, it may be helpful to think of URIs as identifying *interfaces* to resources, rather than resources themselves; i.e., if one asserts that two URIs identify the same resource, it really is the same resource.  </s>
<s> * One-to-One - that is, each URI identifies a separate resource, and one can only assert that the resources they identify are identical in every measurable way, but not the same resource.  </s>
<s> Please note that I'm not saying that in either there's any defined way of looking at URIs and determining the relationships between the  </s>
<s> interfaces that they identify.  </s>
<s> One could, of course, come up with a format that allowed such relationships to be described and advertised by their authorities...  </s>
<s> It's a fairly fine distinction, I know, but I'm not sure that it's universally agreed to.  </s>
<s> What do people think?  </s>
<s> I'm interested to see if there are substantial differences in the URI, REST, Web architecture and Semantic Web communities.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Mark Nottingham http://www.mnot.net/  </s>
<s> That's the current position of the TAG: "Web architecture does not constrain resources to be uniquely named."  </s>

<s> I may be able to speak for the Semantic Web community in this: if you want to use URIs to name things like coffee makers and stars (as we  </s>
<s> do), only a Many-to-One relationship could possibly work.  </s>
<s> Anything which exists (whatever that means) independent of a particular authority can sensibly be given different names by different authorities, and to imagine that it could not be.... to imagine that there is at most one URI which identifies the Sun.... seems pretty unworkable.  </s>
<s> Of course I also see that when you think of URIs (especially working HTTP ones) as communication end-points (or, as I've written, ResponsePoints [1]) they are very, very close to one-to-one.  </s>
<s> Then it really is splitting hairs (in the neighborhood of "http://www.w3.org/" identifying the same thing as "http://www.w3.org") to see whether they  </s>
<s> are 1-1 or 1-many.  </s>

<s> Re: Many-to-One vs One-to-One I think the question is ill-formed; it assumes that the space of resources has a well defined equality relationship.  </s>
<s> Before you can ask if there are two URIs U1 and U2 such that U1 != U2 but ResourceIdentifiedBy(U1) == ResourceIdentifiedBy(U2) you have to know what '==' means for resources.  </s>
<s> But there is no well-defined equality for resources, so the question doesn't make sense.  </s>
<s> many-to-one and one-to-one only apply to spaces with well-defined (and, for that matter, unique) equality relationships.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> From a Many-to-One set, any element is equal to another element in the same set.  </s>
<s> So, you need to define the conditions on the set.  </s>
<s> The formal semantics for RDF talks about there being a *set* of resources.  </s>
<s> To define a set, there needs to be some notion of equality, or sameness, which I would assume to be the notion used in talking about one-to-one or many-to-one.  </s>
<s> Of course, this line is applicable only to a semantic web viewpoint, I guess others might vary.  </s>
<s> Do we mean for resources to be set theoretic in nature?  </s>
