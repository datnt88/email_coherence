Hi Keith, I had a chance to talk to Geoff Clemm today about the Delta-V BOF in Oslo, and the concerns you raised there about whether there are enough people willing to work on a Web versioning and configuration management protocol. 
I'm sure it will come as no surprise to you that I both firmly believe there should be a Delta-V working group, and that I intend to work to help this group reach its goals. 
I decided not to attend the Oslo IETF meeting primarily due to the high cost in time and money of attending, not due to any lack of interest or intent to work on the subject. 
As you know, versioning support has been part of WebDAV's vision from the very first WebDAV BOF in San Jose in Fall 1996. 
Beyond merely being the "V" in WebDAV, I see versioning as a key capability for supporting remote teams working collaboratively to develop complex information artifacts like Web sites, software systems, network protocols, and clusters of related XML documents. 
The Delta-V protocol will provide the ability for Web-based authoring tools to access a spectrum of compatible versioning servers that span a variety of document management, configuration management, file system, and Web portal repositories. 
It also promises a clear migration path for client applications that want to add cross-platform versioning support, leading to a time when versioning support is a native capability of the majority of editing tools. 
It may not be evident from the outside, but the people already working on the Delta-V design are of world-class caliber. 
Geoff Clemm is on the program committee of the Software Configuration Management (SCM) workshop series, the best peer-reviewed venue for publication of work on versioning and software configuration management, and has published several important papers in the field. 
Chris Kaler, Bradley Sergeant, and Jeff McAffer are all senior engineers who have had lead roles in the design of their companies' respective CM repositories. 
David Durand recently finished his Ph.D. on how to do within-document versioning for wide-area non-lock-based collaboration. 
Jim Amsden has deep knowledge on how software development environments employ CM, while Bruce Cragun has similarly deep knowledge on the use of versioning in his document management system. 
With the contributions of the entire mailing list leveraging this extremely talented core group, I have significant confidence that the Delta-V effort will develop an interoperability protocol that is of the highest technical quality, of which the IETF can be proud. 
Furthermore, by developing a key infrastructure for versioning and configuration management, this protocol will further the long-held goal, first pursued with FTP and email, of making the Internet itself a platform for collaborative work. 
I encourage you to approve the Delta-V charter, and to work with us to achieve our goal of improving the document collaboration facilities of the Internet.

Jim, 
The purpose of a BOF is to determine whether there is sufficient interest in forming a working group. 
When I ask for a show of hands of those interested in doing work, and only six people raise their hands, this is not a good sign. 
It raises the question not only as to whether there are enough people to do the work, but also as to whether the BOF has attracted the right constituency. 
When a group that isn't yet chartered claims to have not only a design team but an already mature design, this is not a good sign. 
To me the fact that the WebDAV group did not get versioning done within its alloted timeframe may be an indicator either that the group was spread too thin, and/or that it did not have the right constituency to work on versioning. 
Regardless, the advantage of a new group is that it attracts new blood, and that it allows the participants of a new group to make a fresh start. 
That does not mean that prior art should be ignored or discarded, but neither should the leaders of the group assume a priori that it will be used. 
I'm also concerned that people seem to assume that it's appropriate to do most of this group's work in design teams, and/or in face-to-face meetings outside of IETF. 
Unless such meetings are approved in advance by the area directors, and the other announcement and reporting requirements are met, this is a process violation. 
Numerous groups have been violating these rules, and it should be very clear that this will not be tolerated in the future. 
I am certainly among those who believe that web document management will be hugely valuable, and I certainly want to see this work happen. 
All I have asked for is evidence that a sufficient number of people are willing to do the work (by having them send email to me and my co-AD), and that the work represents a broad constituency of those interested in web document management - so I can have confidence that it will be done in an open fashion rather than by a self-selecting group of narrower interests. 
Considering the number of danger signs I saw in the BOF, I don't think this is an unreasonable request. 
And I'm perfectly willing (eager in fact) to push the group's charter if the proper assurances can be provided.

Keith, 
One of the contributors to the low show of support at the BOF was the perception that, since we had a successful BOF in Minneapolis where there was significant support shown, it was not necessary to repeat this in Oslo. 
Since repeated emails to you from Jim Amsden and myself between Minneapolis and Olso for feedback on our charter were never answered, we assumed you were simply busy, and it never crossed our minds that you needed additional evidence, in the form of a cadre of eager workers, to be convinced. 
I'm a bit confused by this -- I have been laboring under the impression that starting a working group using a reaonably-thought out draft as a starting point is a plus, rather than a minus. 
We've been aware from day one that the mailing list is the final arbiter of consensus on any specification we produce, and hence this design is subject to change based on discussion on the mailing list. 
There has been no conscious effort to stifle discussion. 
In fact, I welcome any and all discussion on our drafts, and I also welcome any ideas you have on how to increase discussion and feedback. 
I agree that the original WebDAV group didn't have sufficient versioning expertise to do versioning well. 
However, the participants on the Delta-V mailing list are substantially different than those who worked on the initial WebDAV specification. 
I think the Delta-V group has a good mix of fresh participants who bring a solid versioning and CM background, as well as people who worked on the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol, so that some design continuity is preserved. 
These should probably be re-stated on the wg-chairs list, then. 
I have been laboring under the impression that full WG meetings outside the IETF needed to go through this approval channel, but that smaller design meetings did not. 
I'll bet I'm not the only chair who is confused about this. 
But, as for wanting to do work outside the IETF in face-to-face meetings, this doesn't surprise me. 
Versioning and CM are topics where it is extremely helpful to be able to draw trees and graphs and point to things and say "that's what I mean". 
ASCII art on a mailing list is a really painful alternative. 
Furthermore, it's hard to get meaningful work done in just a couple of hours in an IETF meeting. 
Frankly, two days of intensive meetings just on a particular subject are more useful in getting work done than 1 or 2 sessions at an IETF meeting. 
But, I agree we need to continue to work hard at making our process as transparent as possible. 
I certainly believe this broad interest exists -- as you've seen, I have been encouraging people on the Delta-V list to contact you and let you know they're interested, and willing to work.

Keith, I have been involved with the versioning work, and will continue to be involved, so long as the IETF sponsors such an activity. 
To be honest, I'm surprised that there is a question about the importance of, or interest in, versioning given that the DAV working group had sufficient interest to include "versioning" in their name. 
I believe that document versioning is a critical part of distributed authoring on the Web and I hope that the IETF decides to (continue to?) sponsor this work.
