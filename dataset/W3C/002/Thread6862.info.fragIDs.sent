<s> I think it's a great idea to provide info on all the XMLspec stuff (along with the other spec production methods, of course)...  </s>
<s> In general, you probably want to point to the spec-prod CVS branch: The XMLspec DTD's latest version is there (I will work to get the old versions in somehow), along with XSLT stylesheets for HTML and FO output, and experimental schemas of various descriptions.  </s>
<s> Most of this is Norm's work.  </s>
<s> The documentation (which I should also get into CVS) is at: There's an appendix (http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report#apps) that describes various tools people have produced, but by now it's probably sorely out of date.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to make it a priority to totally redo the documentation for V3.0, which I hope to attack in the next couple of weeks.  </s>
<s> Some examples: XML specification itself: XLink: XML Base: (nicely formatted) Many other specs use it, though often with a customized version of the DTD.  </s>
