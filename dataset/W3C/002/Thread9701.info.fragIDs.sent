8) Datatypes This is the bottleneck that is keeping us from completing our work; I'd like to spend the majority of time on this call to figure this out. 
Some ready-reference notes/context: a) My analysis digging through the working group and interest group posts on this issue is right in line with Graham's Looking at the various responses to the survey, it seems to me that there isn't a clear community consensus about what is desired or needed. 
More to the point, I think Graham further summed up my views beter than I could articulate these ... Following the lead of others [1,2] I'm thinking it's time to reduce the problem to something we can agree on. 
Agreeing with Jeremy, I think nobody has problems with the local typing idiom. 
Maybe the global datatyping idiom, however seductive, is just a Bad Idea? 
I'm ready to throw in the towel on that bit. 
I think it's better not to try and specify it than to specify it badly. 
#g [1] Jeremy's messages: (latter part, what is URI for "Valentines day MT"?) [2] Guha's message: - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0002.html b) Patrick has sent regrets, but has a clear position on this - If there is a vote regarding tidy/untidy literals this Friday, please accept this as my vote in favor of unitidy literals and against tidy literals.
