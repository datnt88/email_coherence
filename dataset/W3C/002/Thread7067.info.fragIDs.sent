This one never dies, does it? 
In a similar conversation I'm having elsewhere, I pointed to some work Rohit Khare did 3 years ago; a presentation[1] given to TWIST '99, and an article[2] written for his "Seventh Heaven" column he had in IEEE Internet Computing. 
I think these do a fine job at explaining how a single identifier can be both a name and a locator when used in different contexts.

Unresolved problems have a nasty habit of hanging around ;-) 
But what if you need the name of both a non-location resource and it's location in the same context? 
If the same name can denote a location resource in one context and a non-location resource in some other context, fine. 
But the SW is one single context and we need a formal distinction between the two. 
If some folks don't need that formal distinction, fine, but that doesn't mean that those of us who do need such a formal distinction shouldn't seek solutions. 
Thanks for the pointers.
