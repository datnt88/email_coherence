<s> In a similar conversation I'm having elsewhere, I pointed to some work Rohit Khare did 3 years ago; a presentation[1] given to TWIST '99, and an article[2] written for his "Seventh Heaven" column he had in IEEE Internet Computing.  </s>
<s> I think these do a fine job at explaining how a single identifier can be both a name and a locator when used in different contexts.  </s>

<s> Unresolved problems have a nasty habit of hanging around ;-)  </s>
<s> But what if you need the name of both a non-location resource and it's location in the same context?  </s>
<s> If the same name can denote a location resource in one context and a non-location resource in some other context, fine.  </s>
<s> But the SW is one single context and we need a formal distinction between the two.  </s>
<s> If some folks don't need that formal distinction, fine, but that doesn't mean that those of us who do need such a formal distinction shouldn't seek solutions.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the pointers.  </s>
