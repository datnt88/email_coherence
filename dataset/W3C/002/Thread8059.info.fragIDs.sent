? Is it important to be IETF registered ?

Yes. A non-registered URI scheme doesn't have *any* guaranteed uniqueness, so it doesn't serve it's stated purpose...

That's not true. 
If I create a URI scheme where the scheme name is "http://www.xythos.com/storageServer/locktoken/", 
without registering this with the IETF, it can still meet the uniqueness guarantee. 
For that matter, a sufficiently long randomly generated set of characters, as long as it meets the URI formatting requirements, statistically meets the uniqueness guarantee.

You can't create a URI scheme with that kind of scheme name. 
The scheme part of a URI is the string before the first colon, so the URI scheme for that URI is just "http" (which indeed *is* a registered URI scheme). 
And yes, you can use these kinds of URIs for lock tokens. 
How do you "statistically" meet a requirement?
