<s> Guys, I would like some advise on the preferred terminology to use when discussing reification.  </s>
<s> If we start with a triple a b c .  </s>
<s> and reify it, we get a graph of four triples _:x rdf:type rdf:Statement .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:subject a .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:predicate b .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:object c .  </s>
<s> 1. I think it is correct to refer to the second graph as "a reification" of the first triple, is that right?  </s>
<s> 2. Is there a preferred terminology to refer to the bnode which denotes the triple in the reification, ie _:x in this example?  </s>
<s> (If  </s>
<s> not, I will have to make one up.)  </s>

<s> Preferred by whom?  </s>
<s> A possibility is "one of those pieces of reification s@&amp;%*$#t", but that's probably not what you mean (accurate, mind you, but a bit long, and probably wouldn't be allowed in a W3C Rec).  </s>

<s> Heh, unless you ensure it uses "-ize" instead of "-ise" in all the appropriate places.  </s>
<s> Preferred name: "The (b)node that denotes the triple in the reification"?  </s>
<s> It depends on how many times you need to write it.  </s>
<s> "The reifying bnode" might be an acceptable alternative, providing you introduce the phrase first.  </s>

<s> http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ Theoremhood is positively decidable.  </s>
<s> It just takes time at least exponential in the length of the proof.  </s>
<s> yes.  </s>
<s> M&amp;S uses "reified statement".  </s>
