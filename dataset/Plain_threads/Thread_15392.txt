(any hardware independant of a comp?) also im concerned abt compatibility and performance.

(or get an adsl modem with router?)

(and we can also put out the word to the rest of the world not to do business with them... but, honestly, i'll be very surprised if they won't work with you on this.) otherwise, you going to have to leave the first pc in place to do the pppoe and make the conversion from usb. it would have to be running anytime you wanted another computer to access the internet - which is kinda stupid to have to put up with that. as you surmised, the wireless router would be next in the chain. dw
