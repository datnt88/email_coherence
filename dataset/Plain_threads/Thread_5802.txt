(and then there is duel channel memory motherboards). move fast there are getting to be less & less agp motherboards out there. there are a lot of good brands out there so it is all up to you and your wallet. (enjoy your new build) good luck wendell h

8711	5	180398	1977544	1977542	npiesco	6/1/06 7:52 pm	1.14919152e12	wait...	is the x2 just the dual core version of the 64? is it worth going dual core? i've heard arguments for and against it

(that is to make room for the new.) i would wait till the funds are correct and go all out. this way you are good for 1 to 2 years. (time waits for know one) for the guy building the computer: (good luck) wendell h

8711	9	180398	1979635	1977678	islandporgy	6/2/06 7:39 pm	1.14927714e12	best bet pci express motherboard	i would wait, and get a pci express motherboard. you will not be making a bad choice. newer games are coming out, and then you may want to get (microsoft vista). by waiting you will not regret it, that is what i intend on doing. but what you are doing now is good asking questions, i did that for over a year before i built my first. good luck wendell h
