6870	1	11535	131708	131703	col	2/11/04 1:56 pm	1.07650776e12	sorry - should have added teh following	o/s - windows xp home (original installation, not upgrade from previous version) tried removing the driver and forcing an update but still got the problem - though this did fix it long enough for me to run a cleaning disk on the drive. tried different types of disk as well and no format is recognised, (cd cdr cdrw and audio cd)

6870	9	11535	160819	160790	r. proffitt	3/3/04 11:26 am	1.07831316e12	just chiming in. various pieces of that package has had issues since 2000.	after 5 versions (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and now 2004), the only reason i see for it is a cheap way to get nav (which looks like a misfire in 2004) and disk doctor. the rest can be done without. reference  the same bug continues on in most if not all versions.

(system also has norton system works 2004 on it.) i uninstalled the older oem version of nero and installed the newer oem version 5.5.10.53 and everything works great! i really hope this helps someone as it took me a while to figure out what was going on. good luck!
