(oh no, it stays put) but my biggest factor is &quot;expandibility&quot;!!!!!! my system has some components 9including the case), that going on ten years old now. it has four fans, a upgraded 500gb hd, wonderful new flat screen monitor, have gone through keyboards like my wife goes through pantyhose (anyone else now despise wireless keyboards)?? when it comes time to &quot;start over&quot;, i am confident that much of what i am using now will be utilized, and as far as... ahem, uh, tech support....., well, the guy or gal, who built the system for me, has all of the component criteria at their fingertips, no &quot;mystery&quot; gear that's &quot;sorry, you can only use our parts with our components&quot; runaround. now, if there is need for multiple systems say as for a office app, then, i would have to say &quot;dell&quot;, because as a &quot;temp&quot;, i am in many many many offices, and the vast majority is dell. now, if i can only convince my wife that &quot;alienware&quot; really will make the internet a &quot;smoother, faster, cheaper&quot; place to be......

4045	44	291151	2750283	2749425	merl priester	4/12/08 1:27 pm	1.20800682e12	recommendation with reasons	dell as of right now is number one. i have been ordering dell xp boxes right up until last week and i have bought around 6 since jan 1. the vostro pc line is inexpensive overall, works very well, has real xp cd with it, something not even the gateway did as of the last one i bought. some were core2duo most were pentium dual core. for standard office work, the pdc works just fine. if you are looking to play games, do intensive photo work or video encoding, then a much higher end unit is required. but for 80% of users, a basic unit is fine. all were ordered with a 160 min hd, 1 gig ram, dvd rw and a 19&quot; widescreen with xp pro. the prices vary from day to day but the price is usually around 625.00 including tax. w/o pro 525.00 is their standard tech support the greatest, well maybe not, but it is light years ahead of hp/compaq. gold tech support is outstanding. before the acer purchase i would have gone with gateway as 2nd, now i have no idea as to their build quality. hp/compaq is ok but i never liked the restore disk method, having had to do several restores for customers, the options of format or no format is a might on the limited side, as there is no repair or recovery console available. and if you didn't burn yours to begin with and the hard drive fails, you will be paying for a set from hp and waiting a few days. lenovo(ibm) bought one for a customer with decent specs; they were happy with it, but i could see it ran substantially slower than others with even slower cpu. would never buy another. emachine - although they are on the cheap side, i have sold several of these and so far (years have passed) none have died that i know about. they are less expensive and tech support is not bad. the one time i called i got a rep in utah and he was very helpful. (spoke english and knew what he was doing.) sony - worked on a few - didn't care for all the crap that was &quot;sony&quot; tagged and you couldn't remove without screwing up something. i have built a lot of pc's myself for myself and for others (approx 300) so i am not a novice to this. my own pcs will run faster and usually more smoothly than anything off the shelf. that being said, i at this point, would most likely have to weigh the benefits of a custom pc to a dell and then add anything i might want. dell is expensive when adding extras such as a 2nd drive or more ram, but you have to realize that if everyone bought just the basic unit and nothing else, they would raise the price or go broke. i have priced like hardware from dell and hp and almost always the dell is less expensive, so for me it's just a dell.

(that's my conceit) really, it's because i am constantly upgrading to meet current needs for &quot;others&quot;. most folk i deal with don't want to anticipate their future needs. new comers often only want to do the r-mail thing or to write letters. if they associate with other pc users, it isn't long before they want to do more than their pc is really designed for. they oftem experience unnecessary frustration trying to do what they really can't. another problem, especially with some cheaper brand names is that they are harder to upgrade without major parts replacement. let's face it, if it's cheap there is a reason - and it's not a good one! hope this helps someone aviod a pitfall - norm smith

(p.s. if you don;t know what you're doing, then... learn :p)

4045	97	291151	5274123	2750121	9braines	2/14/12 5:12 pm	1.32923952e12	as of 2012; i am revising my post	since my post in 2008, i have personally experience a decline in product quality, and have seen a sharp decline in the quality of products, and support from hp. although, this has been disappointing, i have seen a sharp increase in the quality of products, support, and market share of apple products. while i highly recommend and regard the lenovo thinkpad products, i am now equally convinced that the apple macbook pro is by far a superior product to most every other platform today. to be honest, if i had to buy a computer tomorrow, i would be torn between the latest thinkpad and the macbook pro. i also have removed the ms windows vista business, from my thinkpad in favor of linux ubuntu 11.10.
