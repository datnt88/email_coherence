4057	2	167240	1850942	1850569	vapcmd	4/2/06 8:00 am	1.1439648e12	look at the pc docs and then look inside the case.	and if there isn't a 3.5&quot; drive bay available for a second hdd, see if you have a 5.25&quot; drive bay available. you could put the 3.5&quot; hard drive in a 5.25&quot; bay (mounting kit required). much much better in my opinion to mount a second drive internally for backup and extra disk space....just read the messages about externals in the storage forum. vapcmd
