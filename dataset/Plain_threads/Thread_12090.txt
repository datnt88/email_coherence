13576	6	170241	1935240	1935018	linkit	5/13/06 1:07 pm	1.14752562e12	i agree with nathanpsz2	i have the same fx5500 video card, and i like it. (i'm not a gamer.) in general, it's not that one shouln't get an agp card for an older system. it's that investing so much (about $300 for the 7800gs) on an agp video card is not advisable. if you get a new system, which gamers tend to do more frequently than gereral purpose users, then you can't transfer your $300 investment to the new computer's pci-express x16 slot. imo, a big waste of money.
13576	7	170241	1940472	1935240	sunnydjs	5/16/06 8:35 am	1.1477685e12	yes, i agree!	i understand your point about upgrading agp is a waste of money. my system has been glitching a lot, and i am thinking of getting a new one. that way, i won't have to waste that money that would go toword a new system. thanks for the advice!
13576	8	170241	1940975	1935240	nathanpsz2	5/16/06 10:40 am	1.147776e12	for the price of a 7800gs...	...you can get a new pcie motherboard and a pretty decent pcie card.
