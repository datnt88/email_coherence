9003	5	155071	1725379	1724681	self-destruction	2/6/06 7:17 pm	1.13925342e12	i am going to do the beeping test right now	it is around 10:16 et. i'll try the test and see what i come up with.
9003	6	155071	1725386	1725209	self-destruction	2/6/06 7:23 pm	1.13925378e12	yes i have that full year warranty.	i have very aware if the gnerous full year warranty. companies usually provide 3 months or a little more. i first had this problem in late november. i sent it to cisnet repairs and got it back in late decmeber and now have the same problem again in early february. i think i must be doing something wrong if the same exact problem happened again. i never touched the inside of the pc until sunday and i saw no damage in the pc. i had the pc run through a ups and that didn't stop anything. i am going to perform a bee test if i hear anything.
9003	7	155071	1725479	1724681	self-destruction	2/6/06 8:37 pm	1.13925822e12	i stripped the pc down	something new just happened. ok as i powered up the pc, i heard no beeps. i then looked over at everything, and at a particular corner of my heatsink/fan i smelled a pretty strong burning smell. as i stated earlier, the heatsink/fan was getting alot quieter toward the last fews days the pc was alive. if i just replace heatsink/fan wil the pc continue to work or has the damage to the processor already been damaged?
