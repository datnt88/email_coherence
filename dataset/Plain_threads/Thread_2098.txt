1578	4	237970	2428634	2428056	morphus1	3/13/07 7:00 am	1.1737692e12	thanks	exactly what i was thinking. can i change the bios to read the new cpu? if so can you tell me how? and as to the fan thing i dont have a clue why it doesnt fit the old system was a alu block mounted to the cpu with the fan mounted to the casing. the new systems clamps are completly different to the old.

1578	6	237970	2429044	2428633	wicksey	3/13/07 4:05 pm	1.1738019e12	it should	if you are sure and double check what the bios update will support then it should recognize the celeron d 1.8 you are referring to. it should work because i just changed from celeron d to pentinum d on my intel motherboard but luckily i did not need to update my bios.
