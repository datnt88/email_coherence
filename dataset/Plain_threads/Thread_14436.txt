(my printer is connected to computer a, so i dont need to add it, but if i got add printer and look in network i do see my workgroup there, is only in computer b where is not finding my workgroup)

(its easy... just drop files from pc a to pc b, because pc a can see pc b and not viceversa) then one day i decided to try linux on my desktop and installed fc4 linux and removed windows.... but after a couple of months i realised that i couldnt live with linux (i am not a techie, i am a md )so i reinstalled xp pro again on my desktop and to my surprise the home network worked perfect as it always had. what i am trying to suggest is if you have the time and are desparate to have a network, do what i did (even though there must be a much much simpler way!!)back up, format your hard drive, and reinstall windows xp!! i cant assure this will work but it did for me. besides reinstalling windows will make your pc like a new one that works as fast as it did the day you bought it!
