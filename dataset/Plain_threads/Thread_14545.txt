13784	3	28622	324094	324079	r. proffitt	7/8/04 8:45 am	1.0892763e12	still a little light.	for xp, i found that sp1 was still required and for windows 2000, over 128gb support of ide drives needs sp3 or sp4. both oses need the registry tweak as well, but the service pack that i installed set the key proper. the reply and add new discussion buttons are a tad too close, aren't they? bob
