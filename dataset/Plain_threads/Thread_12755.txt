1185	6	100955	1161795	1160644	bobchiin	4/29/05 4:59 pm	1.11479394e12	ok,i'll try to be more explicit	the reason i have not mentioned companies is because i live in japan and i don't think anyone would be familiar with them. i'm using an adlink transceiver to connect wireless to my current isp. this transceiver is hardwired directly to my buffalo router and then my desktop computer is hardwired from my router. the computer actually thinks it is on a dsl line. i use the wireless capabilities of my router to connect my notebook pc to my isp. i use my isp for e-mail and as a gate to the internet, all of it's other services are in japanese which myself and my computer can't use. the home system that my wife bought is a dedicated internet system only, it doesn't even have a keyboard. everything is controlled by a remote. this home system is preset to connect to a specific isp that is run by the company that sold us this home system. it is primarily for shopping, rental movies, and games. though it takes awhile to get through all of this companies pages, you can surf the internet like any other isp. the fiber optics line was installed by the phone company. the fiber optics line actually comes directly into my house and it has an access switching box at the end. this switching box has exactly one cable plug. if i understand this correctly the fiber optics line itself has no isp of its own but is dependant on whatever is attached to it to provide the isp number. so, this is where i'm lost. if i hook my router to the fiber optics line i should be able to connect to my isp,right? if i connect my wife's home system to the fiber optics line then she should be able to connect to her isp, right? but what happens if i'm connected and she is connected at the same time? reading on the internet, i've found that this is called multihoming, but it cost many thousands of dollars to do it which i'm not willing to pay. is there no simple solution? thanks. bob
1185	7	100955	1162381	1161795	melati hitam	4/30/05 2:52 am	1.11482952e12	ok, now i'm curious...	i understand that, what you want to do is like a dial up connection, where you can use one phone line to connect to different isp... right? but even dial-up.. you can only call one isp at a time... -- you need different phone line to call your other isp at the same time -- now, have you try to connect your device to that line? does it works and connected to your isp? my guess is.. even if it is working.. you will be connected to your wife isp... not your isp.
1185	8	100955	1163627	1162381	bobchiin	4/30/05 10:22 pm	1.11489972e12	thanks	i want to thank everyone for their input. my problem was solved by a telephone call from my isp. they don't support fiber optic connections so the whole thing is moot. i still think the problem can be solved by some kind of switching hardware. after all, isp's surely don't have thousands of physical lines to the internet. rather they probably only have one or two and route their customers through them. anyway, thank you again. bob
1185	9	100955	1164052	1161795	dick white	5/1/05 7:53 am	1.11493398e12	bob, can you try this?	now i think i understand a little more about the configurations of your systems. would you look at a few things and tell us what they look like. first, there is a cable from your adlink transceiver to your buffalo router. second, there must be a cable between the fiber optic wall box and your wife's new internet system. when you unplug the first cable from the adlink and the second cable from the wall box, do the plugs look alike? in other words, are these two cables both standard ethernet cables? if so, let's try step two. what happens when you take the cable between the adlink transceiver and the buffalo router and instead take the end that was in the adlink and plug it into the fiber optic plug. you will need to turn the router off and then turn it back on, and then reboot your computer. if my hunch is correct, you'll be able to reach the internet using your router and your wife's fiber optic line. of course, now your wife's system is unplugged from the internet (and she's angry too ). plug it into one of the other ports on your buffalo router (right beside the cable to your computer. again, if my hunch is correct, her new machine will connect to her isp's pages. let us know what you find. dw
1185	10	100955	1164936	1164052	bobchiin	5/1/05 7:56 pm	1.11497736e12	what i've found out	aside from what i said before about my isp informing me they can't handle a fiber optics connection, this is what i think i know. the connection you suggest is possible. the only thing that is a major problem is that the router has to be able to handle multiple addresses at the same time. most routers sold currently do not have that capability. sadly, i'm not going to be able to try it out because of my own isp's shortcomings. i'll keep trying to find out more info and check into changing my isp also. if i find an affordable and practical solution i'll let you know. thanks again for everyones help and input. bob
1185	11	100955	1165087	1164936	dick white	5/1/05 10:44 pm	1.11498744e12	regarding your isp...	you mentioned that all you use your isp for is email and as a gateway to the internet. is there anything proprietary about the email service? or is it standard pop3? unless your access to the email server is restricted to only ip addresses issued by your isp, then you don't need to be using their connection. another possibility is to ask if your isp's email can be accessed through a web interface from anywhere on the internet - such as if you were traveling and wanted to check your messages from the hotel connection. instead of a hotel, though, you'll be coming across the internet from your wife's fiber isp. i understand that the buffalo router can't handle multiple ip outside addresses, but i don't think you really need a direct connection to your isp in order to reach your email. you can use the buffalo router to obtain an address from the fiber optic isp. the three systems (your desktop, your laptop, and your wife's new system) will then each draw a private non-routable ip address from the router, and the router will manage all the translations between the 3 inside and 1 outside addresses. we may need to sort out the exact method that your wife's network issues ip addresses (static or dynamic) and whether there is a logon of some sort embedded in her system. hopefully those issues will be easy to put into the buffalo router configuration so that it will log onto the fiber optic isp. dw
