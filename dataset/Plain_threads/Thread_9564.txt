3013	3	562247	5306364	5306359	r. proffitt	5/2/12 8:25 am	1.3359471e12	did you check the video card specs?	i've yet to see one that allows all three to be used like you wanted.

3013	5	562247	5306428	5306432	r. proffitt	5/2/12 9:51 am	1.33595226e12	sure. i tend to like the newer 3450 so	here's the 5450 on newegg.  the pcie x1 is what those slots on the motherboard are. if i were to bet, the x16 slot is in use but i can't tell from the post so far. bob

3013	7	562247	5306439	5306436	r. proffitt	5/2/12 10:31 am	1.33595466e12	as to 25, 27, 28.	i think you can figure out that. as to cheapest, you go shopping. i only go as far as this then you get to do the work. sorry if that upsets anyone but this is all volunteer and i only go so far. the juice issue is a good question and why i picked this card. so you don't have a juice issue (unless there is more added to the machine that we know about.) bob.
