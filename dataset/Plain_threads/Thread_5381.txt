(im thinking wide screen) i have been looking at some samsung monitors, but i honestly havent had much of a problem with my nec after all these years. but i am open to suggestons. i also don't want to spend more than $200 for a new monitor. i have no problem with a refurbished monitor. i don't know if all the newer lcd monitors allow me to use a vga cord or not, but i need that also i think. links to things would be appreciated. thanks in advance!!

5971	2	331676	2987626	2986549	fbbbb	2/24/09 12:44 pm	1.23547944e12	with an analog interface...	... you should be able to support bigger monitors at least in terms of pixels. i would suggest you double-check, but 22&quot; level resolutions of 1680 x 1050 - ish should not be a problem. not sure how the bigger picture will look or how it will perform though. (btw your hp link is dead) at $200, you're in 22&quot; territory. samsung make some decent budget 22-inchers - shop around on newegg, etc. i'm not an enormous fan of large cheap monitors (since they tend to be based around tn panels, which results in noticeable colour changes at the edges of a &gt;20&quot; monitor when sitting in front of it), but a 22&quot; is bearable for me for the most part and i'm sure for most, the colour shift wouldn't even register most of the time. i've used the '08 predecessor of this monitor in quad-monitor configurations and i felt it was as good as any 22&quot; monitor i've tried.

(if it did that would be great, just not required.) if i need to sacrafice a little smaller screen to have a better picture (resolution etc) then so be it. i really don't want a monitor that makes it hard to read text. (yes, i use clear type) the nec multisync 1700m+ that i've had for about 8 years has been outstandingly reliable, but was made in 2001, and im sure there are some new monitors out there that would just blow my mind when comparing this nec to whatever is so many years newer. i have looked at ebay, at pacificgeek, ecost, and a few other sites and have been trying to look at the innumerous lcd monitor reviews, and keeping them all straight has become quite a challenge. i have hoped to come across a review site that had a dropdown of features so i could compare easier, but i have yet to find such a site. again, thank you for any input you may have, i am not as technologically (is that a word? heh) smart as many are. thanks again. all links to monitors that might fit what i am asking for would be greatly appreciated.
