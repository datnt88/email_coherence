(the only thing i did that was different was place a colored sheet of paper behind multiple photos to scan multiples simultaneously into photoshop elements. i abandoned that for unrelated reasons.) if you can offer suggestions or possible websites for me to study, i will be so grateful. (sorry for length of message).
