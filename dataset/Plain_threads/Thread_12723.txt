6478	9	335769	3008772	3008761	mrfriendly	3/22/09 5:29 pm	1.23774294e12	that's a problem.	on the stock heatsink/fan a couple of the tabs seem to behaving a problem, they snap in but won't stay so it looks like i'll need a new one anyway, this one has a little mileage on it.
6478	10	335769	3008888	3008772	vapcmd	3/22/09 8:13 pm	1.23775278e12	agree...the stock intel hsf is a problem. take a look	over at  've go great info about the hs fans especially thermal transfer and noise. from there ...you can go to your favorite source, buy it and install it. take a look at those made by xigmatek ....they've got some decent hs fans at reasonable prices ... but it's good to get the bracket kit to avoid the mounting problem. keep us posted. vapcmd
