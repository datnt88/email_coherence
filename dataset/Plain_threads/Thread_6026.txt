(but even if i get no reception in my apartment, i know the transmitter is on because if i take my laptop down the hall, it picks up the neighbor's signal loud and clear.) is there a stronger *receiving* antenna that i can install in my apartment so i can always pick up the neighbor's signal? all the repeaters and extenders i see advertised seem to apply to the sender's location. what, if anything, can i do as the receiver?
