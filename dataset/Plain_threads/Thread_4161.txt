141	2	531579	5156556	5156256	koangal	6/28/11 5:19 pm	1.30928154e12	missing driver	i did consider it might be a driver issue but did not feel comfortable trolling the web looking for a needle in a haystack-correct driver. i did check out the windows 7 compatibility center. they listed 2039 monitors/tv's that are compatible with windows 7. they listed only 3 emachines monitors. my emachines monitor wasn't listed. i don't have the money to take it to a tech and have them fix the problem. so i think i will live with the black bar on my screen since it is not really a distraction. just thought i'd try and fix it if i could.

141	6	531579	5157200	5157134	koangal	6/29/11 5:19 pm	1.30936794e12	i already checked emachines site	the first place i checked for monitor drivers was at emachines website. for my monitor there are no driver updates available. i think since the monitor is four years old they don't bother to offer driver updates. thanks for the info about driver packs not including monitor.inf files, i did not know that.
141	7	531579	5157198	5157200	r. proffitt	6/29/11 5:40 pm	1.3093692e12	did a little digging.	that notes the hide feature and you can try other settings there. however it's possible that since the monitor is pnp (more praying?) that you'll have fun trying video card drivers too. bob ps. yes, it was sold with the westinghouse label and maybe other names.
