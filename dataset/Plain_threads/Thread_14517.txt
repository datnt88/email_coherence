(obviously) is there a good guide that will take us through installing a hard drive, including both physical installation and partitioning and formatting the drive? i would like to go back and double check that everything has been done correctly up to this point. if possible, i would like a guide that goes into detail about some problems we might encounter (like the current one) as well. thanks again.
