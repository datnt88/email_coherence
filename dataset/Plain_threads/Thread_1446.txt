1857	8	102801	1455289	1455212	slaphppy7	10/3/05 7:51 pm	1.12836906e12	hello to all...	...from athens, tx, usa...i usually reside near port arthur, tx, but unfortunately hurricane rita has displaced me for a while, and the instructions i have that helped me get the monitor back up and working are back home...it involves dis-assembly of the monitor and removal of a heat-shield looking thingy inside...i would not want to try to talk you through the process without the details i have back home, so i will post back here (hopefully within a week or so) as soon as i get back home...sorry for the inconvenience... matt
1857	9	102801	1455679	1455212	iammelinda	10/4/05 5:48 am	1.12840488e12	hp replacement policy	after all my ranting last week, i did get the problem solved by hp. even if you are out of warranty, if your monitor meets the requirement shown on their web site you will get a replaement monitor shipped to you and materials for shipping your old one back to them. i strongly disagree with their requiement that you give them a credit card number as collateral and really went to town on customer service but did finally give in and give it to them so i could get back up and running. i was very pleasantly surprised when the new monitor arrived the next day and everything is now working. i kept calling customer service until i actually got an agent i could understand and who spoke with me instead of reading from a script and putting me on hold - once for an hour. i also e-mailed the ceo of hp and got two phone calls the next day from his consumer affairs deptartment. keep at it. it is a defective product and they know about it. good luck.
