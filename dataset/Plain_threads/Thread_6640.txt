6080	1	577439	5383172	5383035	vapcmd	11/10/12 6:05 am	1.3525275e12	looks good from here and i offer the following..	everything looks decent .....case looks great but a little overpriced. suspect you can find the same functionality ....internal and external drives, fans, etc., without spending $189. ram....the timings (latency) are higher (slower) than most dd3 1600....the dimms selected show 11-11-11-30 whereas most ddr3 1600 dimms are 9-9-9-24 and some are 8 -8-8- 24 or even 7. bottomline, for $75 incl shiiping, i'd look for the highest rated 8gb (x2) or 4gb (x4) dimms rated at 9 or better and then pick the kit that gives you your total 16gb here's a well rated 2 dimm x 8gb kit with 8 latency (runs faster than 9 and 11)  here's a well rated 2 dimm x 8gb kit with 9 low latency (runs faster than 11)  let us know what you ultimately choose and how it goes. vapcmd

6080	5	577439	5383337	5383324	vapcmd	11/10/12 12:32 pm	1.35255072e12	another reference site...you pick what video cards	you want to compare.  from there or tom's, i'd head over to newegg to see what actual buyers say about the ones ...top two or three, you like the best. vapcmd
