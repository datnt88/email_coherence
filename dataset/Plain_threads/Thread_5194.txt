5144	1	62577	742407	742392	ray harinec	2/5/05 7:52 am	1.10758992e12	that, simply, is the nature of proprietary	machines. the only way that they can hold costs down and to keep tech support costs to a minimum is to not support every possible upgrade, and then have to create documentation and training material for their tech support. if you have ever worked on military equipment you would realize that, by far, the biggest cost item of the equipment is the documentation, drawings and manuals, so that people can maintain it. you are are correct about someone possibly modifying the bios. in fact if you can get the code for the normal asus mobo of the same bent, the needed code may be found in it and [with some skill] added to the hp bios. they simply purchase the basic bios code and then modify it to their own needs. it may simply change the cpuid number. you can't have both cheap and a versatile, upgradable system. something has to give. btw, just dealt with hp site and tech support. was totally satisfied.
5144	2	62577	742476	742407	psions5	2/5/05 8:26 am	1.10759196e12	-	yes they are nice people, they registered my complaint without any problems. the board is closest to the asus is the a7v8x-la, which i presume they do offer a bios for, is there anyone ith alot of skill out there that can make this work? but my point is they should not be allowed to restrict hardware, i paid 800 fo a computer with a socket 754 motherboard, which means it can have upto 3700+, and i am going to get it one way or another with hp's help or not. im just begging if there is anyone out there who can write bioses, can they please help poor hp owners?
5144	3	62577	742531	742476	ray harinec	2/5/05 8:55 am	1.1075937e12	try posting directly to ed o'daniel	in the subject line. he is a very bright and knowlegeable in these areas.
5144	4	62577	742619	742531	psions5	2/5/05 9:31 am	1.10759586e12	will do	will do when i get a free moment

5144	6	62577	742768	742737	psions5	2/5/05 10:48 am	1.10760048e12	-	well, theyre in my bookmarks list now, while im at it ill think ill throw in some ram dividers and alot of other settings hp seem to hve &quot;forgotten&quot;
5144	7	62577	742799	742737	r. proffitt	2/5/05 11:07 am	1.10760162e12	and there was... mr. bios.	 used to do such things. i haven't checked recently. my parting comment is such machines as &quot;in a box&quot; and there is nothing wrong with hp not offering such. bob
5144	8	62577	743396	742392	jmarchi	2/5/05 4:32 pm	1.10762112e12	you are the exception	there is a good reason hp doesn't bother to upgrade their bios. you are the exception, not the rule. the vast majority of hp/compaq/dell owners never open the cases of their systems, much less upgrade the processors. there is so little demand that they don't have the need to upgrade, it makes no financial sense to them, since most users will keep the systems for 3-5 years and just replace them. the reason you got the bios update you did get was only because the same model board was sold with a faster processor, but the next generation with the faster processor undoubtedly used a different board, so that was the end of the line. you hit the nail on the head when you said, &quot;don't tell me about your upgradable system&quot;. the fact is, people that build their own and are tinkerers are those the upgrade and want upgrades, not the canned system buyers.
5144	9	62577	743746	742799	edward odaniel	2/5/05 8:30 pm	1.1076354e12	i had forgotten them...	and i agree that hp is well within their rights to decline investing in any more bios updates. matter of fact they seem to be right in line with most main board suppliers with their &quot;cut off&quot;.
5144	10	62577	743906	743396	psions5	2/6/05 1:56 am	1.10765496e12	-	yeah, i guess your right, but mr.bios is onto it, so it looks like i might be able to sort this!
5144	11	62577	777493	742392	signcarver	2/19/05 9:27 pm	1.10884842e12	will a 3700 work without other upgrades	my understanding is that at least some of the pc's hp is selling with that board have a very meager powersupply (only 250 watts) i don't know if i would trust a 3700+ on such a system (i don't know how hp gets even the 3400+ to work with it unless they are using a custom, mobile or crippled processor)without upgrading the psu as well and while you are at it replace the graphics card and this and that... you would be better off getting a complete new 939 system before making such an upgrade.
