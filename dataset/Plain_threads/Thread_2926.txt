9251	9	527641	5137314	5137312	r. proffitt	5/24/11 3:41 pm	1.30625166e12	http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/857/midiconnections.jpg	i see the cable there. remember you have 3 or more discussions going on with what i can only guess is 2 per cent of the story. let me part with this. this is over a decade old so you may have to scrounge up the remaining parts if you lost them. bob
