4859	2	297051	2786972	2786954	daylightcnet	6/4/08 5:59 pm	1.21260234e12	thanks for the reply	thanks for your reply. i heard other people say that it would be better to take a dual core, because the quad core is quite good at multitasking, but the dual core performs better at gaming (single application) and in this setup it has a slightly better graphics card. then again in other topics ive been reading that intel is now slightly better with intel core 2 processors then amd. so im getting confused and don't know what is true and or better.

4859	5	297051	2787098	2786953	daylightcnet	6/5/08 1:37 am	1.21262982e12	thank you all for the informative replies.	i am conviced that the intel is faster now reading all those topics. but im also convinced that the gpu is very important. the phenom quad sunk to the bottom of my list at the moment . so i gues it's up to what is more important when gaming. the difference between the amd x2 6000+ and intel's cpu. or the difference between the amd x2 6000+ and intel's gpu. today i will go to the store, see what the opinion is of the guys who will put em together. i bet they have some experience with customers buying them and how things evolved. will report back later what they had to say . and thanks all for the advice, it did help me.
4859	6	297051	2787200	2787098	daylightcnet	6/5/08 6:18 am	1.21264668e12	this is what i went for.	i have ordered my pc, thanks for all the advice. this is the setup i finally went for: intel core 2 quad q6600 (fsb 1066) 4096 mb ddr2-ram 800 mhz asus en9800gx2/g/2di/1g geforce en9800gx2 (1 gb ddr3, 256-bit, 2 x dvi-i)
4859	7	297051	2787573	2787098	ramarc	6/5/08 12:23 pm	1.21266858e12	?	quote: &quot;the difference between the amd x2 6000+ and intel's cpu. or the difference between the amd x2 6000+ and intel's gpu.&quot; intel doesn't make any gpu (except integrated graphics). only get an x2 6000+, if you can't afford a $195 3ghz e8400. the x2 will be slower than any 2.5ghz core2duo.  as for the graphics card, an 8800gtx/768mb is no longer worth its price. the 8800gts/512 has virtually identical performance for less, and the 8800gt/512 is only a bit slower but still fast enough for most gamers.

4859	10	297051	2788229	2788191	daylightcnet	6/6/08 2:50 pm	1.2127638e12	windows xp i think	ive ordered the computer, i don't have it yet, i will have it tomorrow. the os ill be installing will be windows xp, not that i dislike vista, but vista seems to take more resources that i don't need while gaming. also if i check the official game webpages i often see that the minimal/requirement/optimal system page asks for a heavyer system when your os is vista and lower when your os is xp. so if they say xp needs less powerfull system to get the same results then im not going to run vista because it prolly slows the system down a bit. at least thats what my logic tells me, anyone let me know if i am wrong.
