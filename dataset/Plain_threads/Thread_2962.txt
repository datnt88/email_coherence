10336	6	267638	2606967	2606989	ck87.jf	10/14/07 9:26 pm	1.19239716e12	does monitor count?	i had the monitor hooked up, but just now i tried again without monitor, and no beeping. to re-affirm your question, the only things on the table are: power supply, motherboard (on top of static bag), cpu, heatsink/fan. out of curiosity, how much voltage does the speaker need? i could potentially put some voltage straight to it to test it ... so you know, there are nothing on the power/reset/etc jumper pins - i am turning the computer on using a piece of metal across the two power pins.
10336	7	267638	2607003	2606967	r. proffitt	10/14/07 9:33 pm	1.19239758e12	details matter.	while you need to check your work (cmos clear jumpers and such) there is some that run into this dead system where the cpu and motherboard are good but doesn't boot. i made that mistake last week with a new socket 775 system. in the end i had to hit the maker's web site and my 775 dual core cpu wasn't on the list. details are missing so no one but you can check this out. bob

10336	10	267638	2612312	2612269	r. proffitt	10/22/07 8:01 am	1.19304006e12	&quot;any other parts?&quot;	i see you have more work to do. it sometimes takes a few tries for people to get there. bob

10336	12	267638	2612393	2612356	r. proffitt	10/22/07 9:56 am	1.19304696e12	what about the case?	is this still in the case? when i have a dead pc i strip it down to 4 and only 4 parts. this way i know it's just those 4 parts. no case, no ram, etc... bob
10336	13	267638	2612419	2612356	ck87.jf	10/22/07 10:19 am	1.19304834e12	no case	about a week ago, re: troubleshooting by ck87.jf - 10/14/07 7:06 am in reply to: not a failure but a dead pc you built? by r. proffitt moderator anyway, the motherboard is sitting on its static bag, on my desk. so, no shorting on the back of it. so, there is no case.
10336	14	267638	2612434	2604610	r. proffitt	10/22/07 10:21 am	1.19304846e12	then we are looking at the dead part or parts.	no beep means it's dead part(s), incompatible parts or we have something horribly wrong. bob
10336	15	267638	2612469	2612434	ck87.jf	10/22/07 11:33 am	1.19305278e12	okay, so	aside from trying to find a friend with an amd 939, what are my other options to figure out what's dead? i called best buy and circuit city, and for them to diagnose the problem, they both want $50.
10336	16	267638	2612530	2612469	r. proffitt	10/22/07 12:31 pm	1.19305626e12	what else do we have to work with?	here i have a voltmeter, spare psu, speaker so i can get such systems down to motherboard and/or cpu. but current technology only gets us to those parts. i also use the voltmeter to read the cmos battery since if it's too low you will find some boards being held in reset. bob

10336	18	267638	2612739	2612434	ck87.jf	10/22/07 5:36 pm	1.19307456e12	motherboard	my motherboard's page on newegg ...  it says &quot;athlon 64 x2 / athlon 64 fx / athlon 64&quot; for the cpu specs ... i have an athlon 64 x2 i could be wrong, but i believe this is the cpu i got - i'll get my mom to check her purchase history when i can. amd athlon 64 x2 4200+ toledo 2.2ghz
