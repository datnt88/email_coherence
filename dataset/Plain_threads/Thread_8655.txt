'nuff said about pmr. wayne click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. my mini-schnauzer is smarter than your honor student.

1240	10	289799	2780876	2742432	spaghettiwestern	5/25/08 6:49 pm	1.21174134e12	my suggestions	$150 is a very practical range esp if u shop at newegg.com (great service. a lot of free shipping. no hassle awesome return policy. they sell oems tho). anyway i know apricorn and seagate are good companies. i heard about lacie being good but i never see one first hand. just dont get maxtor. but my real suggestion is... use of an external encloser. get an aluminum enclosure with a fan from mapower and a good seagate internal harddrive and ur ready to go. think it'd be a bigger bang for the buck too and not as much bucks lol. hope this helps.
