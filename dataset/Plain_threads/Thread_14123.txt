14561	4	602736	5504853	5504809	mcu_121	10/4/13 7:30 pm	1.380915e12	alright	my operating system is windows xp. my older usb works perfectly in it, but my pc is not responding with this new one nor my friend hard disk. i can make them work if i plugged them before starting the pc. what kind of other details you want to know?.
14561	5	602736	5504868	5504853	james denison	10/4/13 10:03 pm	1.38092418e12	the old one usb1.0?	open the device manager program, then plug in the problem usb device. check the usb section then in device manager, see if you can find any info about what's going on there. i've seen problem where newer fast flash memory cards wouldn't read in a slow reader and maybe the same happens with some of the newer fast usb flash thumbdrives. windows sees it on bootup, but ignores it if plugged later. that's odd, but maybe due to bios settings. while in device manager, look under the computer part (right at the top) and see if it says an acpi computer, which would mean windows takes over for bios when it boots. set bios to be shadowed.

14561	9	602736	5505049	5505047	r. proffitt	10/5/13 10:36 am	1.38096936e12	much more than that.	i don't see make, model, if the drivers are installed and we all know driver update is not to be trusted. we have issues with front usb ports to mention and then after this many posts i don't see anything about the usb sitck details. i do not think i would format the pc. i would like to see every detail. bob
14561	10	602736	5505029	5504781	r. proffitt	10/5/13 10:39 am	1.38096954e12	&quot;when i plugged in my friend hard disk, i also encountered&quot;	maybe this drive is not ready to use? all these posts and i can't find what this usb thing is. it could need preparing for use by deleting any partition on it, create a new partition then formatting it. you bring up a good point here. is this asking a lot of today's users? that is, should products arrive ready to be used? bob
14561	11	602736	5505112	5505029	mcu_121	10/5/13 12:17 pm	1.38097542e12	more informations..	all the drivers are installed, i don't see any yellow question mark on any of them. but in ports (com & lpt) section, i see that (com4) has an &quot;x&quot; sign on it. i have two usb, &quot;imation&quot; 4gb and another one i forgot its company with the size of 2gb. yesterday i bought a &quot;sandisk cruzer facet&quot; usb with the size of 32gb. the problem is that the previous two works perfectly, but only with this new one that i'm facing difficulties in accessing it. and i'm guessing they all use the same drive?. but like i said, i can access it fine if i plug it (or my friend's hard disk) before starting the pc. so you recommend to delete every partition (c,d) and then format it?.
14561	12	602736	5505107	5505112	r. proffitt	10/5/13 12:23 pm	1.38097578e12	no i did not recommend to delete c or d.	&quot; the previous two works perfectly &quot; and i'm guessing the other two are also 32gb sandisk cruzers and this stick does not work on other pcs per your words above so it's back to the store to exchange it. xp does not natively support 32gb memory sticks. here's a link about that issue.  to gain support for such large drives we need xp to be all updated to sp3 as well install kb955704. sorry for all the posts above but there was some basic information missing. bob
14561	13	602736	5505129	5505107	mcu_121	10/5/13 2:47 pm	1.38098442e12	i'll try it	the other two usb i have is (imation) 4gb and another one i forgot its company with the size of 2gb. they do work on the pc. as for the new usb (32gb sandisk cruzers), it works only when i plug it in to the pc before starting it. but it works perfectly fine in my laptop. so the problem is definitely from the pc. i read what is in the link, my problem is slightly different, because my pc does read the usb, but i can't access it. i can only access it with the method mentioned above. i'll try your solution and i'll get back to inform you about the results. thanks for your help.
14561	14	602736	5505164	5505129	r. proffitt	10/5/13 4:31 pm	1.38099066e12	remember you claim it doesn't work on other pcs too.	the other two are well inside what xp sp3 supports. &quot;my pc is not responding with this new one nor my friend hard disk. &quot; and you state the laptop is fine but my bet is it's not xp. xp has many limitations and arcane issues like this one. bob
14561	15	602736	5505260	5504918	james denison	10/6/13 6:09 am	1.38103974e12	that all seems as it should be	where did you get this usb flashdrive? there are a lot of counterfeits out there which claim sizes bigger than they are, speeds faster than they are, and some of them may not work at all. please investigate some of these links and stories, see if it may apply to your situation.
14561	16	602736	5505357	5505164	mcu_121	10/6/13 3:28 pm	1.38107328e12	i think i'm going to format it.	which one it doesn't work on other pcs?. you mean the new one?. no it works on my laptop as i've said, but like you mentioned, my laptop is windows 7. i updated the windows and installed kb955704, but it's still the same. i think i need to format, as you said, it's something from the windows. again thanks very much.
14561	17	602736	5505381	5505357	r. proffitt	10/6/13 3:34 pm	1.38107364e12	this is where you claim it fails.	may as well try formatting but 32gb means every aspect of windows xp from service packs to drivers and that kb must be up to date. in other words, you are seeing where xp is running out of steam and support. bob
14561	18	602736	5505386	5505381	mcu_121	10/6/13 5:25 pm	1.3810803e12	there seems to be a misunderstanding on your behalf..	i said i &quot;tried it in my laptop and it works perfectly&quot;. i didn't say other pcs. the problem is only in my pc. anyway, my pc is kind of old, it may becomes very slow if i installed windows 7. i actually was planning to format it two weeks ago. hopes it going to work.
14561	19	602736	5505388	5505386	r. proffitt	10/6/13 6:34 pm	1.38108444e12	it doesn't matter	but it was a clue there may be an issue with that stick. you wrote &quot;my pc is not responding with this new one nor my friend hard disk.&quot; which is why i thought the stick may be troublesome. i suggest you stay away from big sticks on xp. bob
14561	20	602736	5505490	5505388	mcu_121	10/7/13 2:49 am	1.38111414e12	i think the problem is in my os.	&quot;my pc is not responding with this new one nor my friend hard disk.&quot;, which definitely mean that the problem is absolutely from my pc, because they both worked perfectly fine in my laptop as i mentioned. i think the problem is in my windows xp, and not the sticks, because i can access the usb in my pc if i used the method i mentioned in my previous post (which is plugging it before the pc start-up), but it's not practical.
14561	21	602736	5505501	5505490	r. proffitt	10/7/13 4:44 am	1.38112104e12	and you find no fix it cure.	xp does work with my 32gb stick but at the office we know to update drivers (no, the update driver button has not worked for this in over a decade) and check out the rest of the system. -&gt; now imagine this usb stick ran some code on insertion. your posts have been light on details for a long time. i know folk do not want to reveal model numbers but if you had written it was a vtop usb 32gb stick i might look to see if that had some of the titles that create trouble. no one i know is writing their little usb apps for xp today. if it works, that's a bonus but no makers are fretting about writing &quot;windows vista/7/8&quot; on the product sheet. bob
