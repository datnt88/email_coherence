8901	6	25982	296355	296258	chuckt	6/18/04 11:01 am	1.08755646e12	a hard drive possibility	i believe that the hard drive will be around for a long time, easily 10 years, but i don't think it will be in its current physical configuration. i think a direction it might go is a hard card, where there will be no rotating parts, at least not a rotating magnetic medium. i think there is a possibility that the medium (which might not even be magnetic) will be stationary, and perhaps a laser will scan the surface to read/write the surface. the beam of the laser will be electronically directed to the various areas and depths needed to access the medium areas. that sort of scheme would eliminate the weakest link of today's hard drive method. with no rotating parts, and with electronic means to not only direct the read/write mechanism but also to keep itself calibrated will possibly make this sort of drive &quot;bullet proof.&quot; just a possibility.

(hmmm - i shoulda patented that; now it's an open source idea.)

(that's not how we do it in the printers though - that's a whole other story.) it isn't done with magnetic fields though (but it could be). instead, some use piezoelectric crystals that can be pulsed at extremely high rates. besides, i have already seen a flat card read by a laser, no rotating disks, at a comdex show over 10 years ago. the capacity was &quot;great&quot;, for that time , somewhere on the order on 100mb on a 3 sq inch surface - which is small compared to today's magnetic medium. but it was just a start. i don't know whatever happened to them. i remember they were handing out an entire star trek game on the card for demos. but you had to buy - when it became available - their card reader to read it.
