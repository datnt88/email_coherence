6928	14	161635	1798644	1798484	mgcurious	3/9/06 4:35 pm	1.1419221e12	video cards	at costco.com these are the video cards i can choose from: integrated ati radeon xpress hypermemory [included] nvidia geforce 6200se w/turbocache 256mb support [add $62.00] 256mb ddr ati radeon x1300 pro [add $153.00] the final price with the ati radeon express which is the basic one is $610 so i need a not-too-cheap-but-okay-video card. i know i seem to be asking a lot of questions but i really need a good computer so i don't blow all my money on this one and have to buy another in the near future.
6928	15	161635	1798748	1798644	nathanpsz2	3/9/06 5:35 pm	1.1419257e12	buy it from newegg	newegg.com simply has the best prices on computer components. here's a video card that's cheaper than the ati and performs better. you will also need a new power supply; the standard one doesn't provide enough power for a seperate video card. the first link is the video card; the second one is the power supply. a link takes you to another page. to go to that other page, click on the link. the link will be blue, and when you move your mouse so that the little cursor is on top of the link, the link will become underlined. video card:  power supply:  wasn't that easy?
