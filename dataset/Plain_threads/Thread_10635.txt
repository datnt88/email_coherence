637	8	119275	1354873	1354494	ray harinec	8/11/05 1:39 pm	1.12376754e12	is that 6.5 or 6:5 [a ratio]?	i suspect it is 6.5, the multiplier. thus you are set for the cpu to run at 6.5 times the memory speed [166 mhz]. the one confusion with these settings are that the memory is ddr, thus 2 clocks per cycle. thus it is either 6.5 time 166 = 1.079 ghz or 2 times that = 2.158. i suspect that your problem is that you only have pc2100 memory [your words]. by trying to run at 200 mhz my guess is that the mobo has defaulted to prevent you from not working because there is know way that your memory can run that fast. pc2100 is ddr266, 133/266 mhz times 6.5 = either 0.8645 or 1.729. so what speed is the sytem reporting??? again you need to find out from sis what that chipset does re that memory speed and quad clocking. if it were an intel chipset it would be easy to find out.
637	9	119275	1354888	1353815	ray harinec	8/11/05 1:50 pm	1.1237682e12	probably not bad memory,	just too slow. get pc3200 when you get the new memory. does your mobo support dual channel memory?? if yes, get a &quot;matched set&quot; and run dual memory mode to get maximum memory bandwidth. two 256's in dual channel is better than one 512 in single channel.

637	11	119275	1355356	1354936	ray harinec	8/11/05 5:03 pm	1.12377978e12	are they up to pc4200 yet??	or is that meant to be pc3200?? they are getting close to 4200 i know, but think that may not happen untill ddr2. imho, if running an intel cpu use an intel chipset, but not an intel mobo. intel mobo's offer nothing to help with overclocking or any other of the features that asus, abit, et al offer.

637	14	119275	1357289	1355790	ozos	8/12/05 11:34 am	1.12384644e12	yeah i was gonna say	standard for ddr2 is pc 5400 which is ddr2 667 (it's seeming to be the pc 3200 of ddr2) 6:5 is a ratio it's the fsb/dram ratio the motherboard set a ratio to keep the ram running at stock speeds and the cpu at stock speeds it shouldn't be doing 1.2ghz though... 200 for the cpu's clock factor, or bus, or whatever you'd like to call it would in turn result in an 800mhz fsb (due to the way pentium 4's are designed) i'm guessing however that it's not running 200/166 but instead 166/133 or 166/100 (pc 2100 - 133mhz/ 266 ddr) see if you can raise the cpu's fsb/frequency and set that ratio to auto so the ratio that says 6:5 see if you can change that setting to &quot;auto&quot; and then see if you can change cpu's clock factor (not sure what it's labeling it, but it's the cpu bus speed) to the correct setting (depending on what your chip's correct setting is, if the chip was bought retail boxed it should include documentation to show what is correct)
