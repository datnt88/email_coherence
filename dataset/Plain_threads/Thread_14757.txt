(downloaded from linksys website) then try to connect your new inspiron... if it is connected and you can browse the internet.. you might want to try the security setting... one step at a time.. now look and choose, how you should connect the devices.. modem --&gt; wireless router --&gt; pc's (wired or wireless) modem router -- wireless router --&gt; pc's (wired or wireless)

11799	3	170525	1887014	1884925	gakada	4/19/06 10:00 pm	1.145484e12	ok, now follow the instruction on	installing the router.. usually you need to install the new router drivers first.. do not connect the router yet. (you have to choose one of your computer to do this) again after you insert the drivers cd, follow the instruction.. you may need to restart the computer.. then you have to connect your computer to the new router... using a cable (wired) -- still do not connect the router to the modem yet.. -- you might want to change the ssid name here.. but do not use any security option yet.. now, when your computer can detect the router.. and you get an ip address .. turn off everything.... and connect your router to the modem, and also connect your computer to the router.. using cable (wired) and turn on the modem first... wait for all the light are stabilized... then turn on the router.. and wait for the light stabilized... now you can turn on your computer ... try it, if you can browse the internet.. then you need to go to the linksys website and download the firmware for your router.. (if available.. look at your firmware version) after you update the firmware. then you can try to disconnect the cable from your computer to router.. and try wireless.. (if you use the wireless capable computer to do the set up -- if you use your dell, then just try your inspiron wirelessly) the point here is to follow the instruction on the manual .. as much as possible...

11799	9	170525	1888069	1887546	gakada	4/20/06 10:40 am	1.1455296e12	good to hear that...	as of the firmware installation, you can look in the manual or the linksys website...
11799	10	170525	1889042	1887439	linkit	4/20/06 6:31 pm	1.14555786e12	i care too	i want all the bug fixes and added functionality of the latest firmware. after struggling with too many failed connections with factory installed firmware, i always update the firmware early in the process. the idea of not updating motherboard firmware (bios) until you need to is usually good advice, but network hardware and especially routers seem to have trouble keeping up with more rapidly changing standards. side issue: anyone willing to claim that there is hastily coded firmware on some of these models? i wonder sometimes.
