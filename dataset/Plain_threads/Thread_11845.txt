14350	4	112176	1280792	1279541	dick white	7/5/05 11:02 am	1.12056132e12	(maybe, maybe not...)	he said he's reset it numerous times already. some folks think turning it off and back on is a reset and are unaware of the pinhole in the back for restoring the factory settings. others know of the full reset procedure (but some units require the button inside the pinhole to be already pressed down before the power is turned on at the switch and then hold the button in for 30 seconds or a full minute until all the lights on the front begin flashing. then let go of the pin/paperclip. it takes two hands and some coordination...) or it could have routed its last packet and now needs to be put out of its misery... dw
