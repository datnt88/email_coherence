(well it was color if you hooked it up to a color television) in all honesty, it was pretty darn cool for 1983. at first i only had cassette tape for storage. but soon i got a single sided single density 5.25 in floppy drive. i had a multiplan spreadsheet cartridge and actually tracked financial information with it. i used the ti99-4a for several years for entertainment and real work. i finally replaced it with a 286 that ran dos in 1988.

(apple was a key on the iic.) the closest thing to the internet was a subscription to compuserve where you used cryptic commands and waited a reply. like &quot;go wea lax&quot; i think to get the weather in la. the &quot;fast&quot; response would come trickling across the monitor in simple text that could be seen moving from left to right. a paragraph could take several seconds. wow! printing was on dot-matrix printers. media for programs and data was with 5.25&quot; floppys that had to be shifted in and out. i had an external floppy drive in addition to the built in drive which saved a few steps. (all programs were on floppies because there was no hd.) surprise- it never crashed, ever. that came later with ms-dos pcs. though i have used windows exclusively since because of compatibility with workplace programs, i've always had a 'soft' spot for apple computers - and may again go back.

(i'd started with the law schools trs-80). you had to climb up onto a little platform with a special seat. my very first computer was a nameless little thing that had a cassette tape drive and used the tv as a screen. in 1985 we got a ibm, whichever model was before the at. i too learned basic and told my young son that if he ever typed &quot;format&quot; lightning would strike him dead. but my very first computer experience, indirectly, was in 1967 while my then husband was in grad school. he typed his programs (in fortan, i think) onto little punch cards and submitted them to what i faultily recall as robed priests at the stanford computer center. i used to go over with him in the middle of the night; there was a priestless reader available where you could run your punch cards through and it would print out whatever was on them. so i would type out letters home on punchcards and then print them. so cool to send letters on wide lined computer paper.

(mostly federal contractor), and ga technologies, inc., ending up as a technical training coordinator for radiation monitoring systems in nuclear power plants, for a total of 22 years. most of the computers were called, &quot;mediums systems&quot;, but some were 8086's tied to dec vax'es by serial rs-232 lines in the end. @ my (2nd) wife's insistence, i went back to school (i had 2 years of college b4 the air force) @ night & got an as, aa in business management in 1985, then went on to san diego state (sdsu) full-time for 2 years to finish a bs/ba in information systems in 1986. i eventually got a civil service job with the navy in 1988 here in san diego county as a computer specialist & retired in 2005 with 21 years as a gs-12 i.t. specialist in systems/network administration/management. my work was on concurrent/perkin elmer/masscomp medium systems & networked 286/386/486 pc's (self-taught). i never would've made it thru sdsu w/o my mac: i bought a mac in &quot;the 1st 100 days&quot;, on march 6, 1984 after seeing the super bowl ad in january & have had 1 ever since. it had 1 800/400 kb floppy drive, 256 kb of ram, no hd, a sharp b&w display, & an image writer dot-matrix printer. it was the 1st computer that i could see any use for @ home. i had turned down the opportunity to buy a full-blown apple iie clone in taiwan because i couldn't see what i would use it for! i hooked my mac up to the internet with a 1200/300 baud modem and spent many an &quot;all-nighter&quot; doing assignments after the on-campus computer labs were closed. in october, i will get the latest powerbook core 2 duo (or whatever) 15&quot; mactel laptop & pass this 15&quot; g4 mpb onto my wife (who is now using my 1996 g3 wallstreet). i will max. out the memory & get the largest/fastest hd i can for it, probably on the after market. i am grateful that pc's have given me a career but having seen all of the headaches they cause users & maintainers over the years, i have always found that the macs gave me a much better experience & life. i volunteer @ the local senior service center's computer lab teaching seniors how to survive with the computer of their choice -mac or pc. i am even more excited about using a mac now that they run the unix/linux os underneath the gui, because that was the os i learned in 1988, and i like it a lot. i may even use it on my new mactel powerbook in a partition! but no windows, ever!!!

(my life partner did have a kaypro years before and my first love in college programmed in fortran at a student job on campus so i claim a certain vintage heritage vicariously. as for vintage audio equipment and changing media affecting museums' and archive's ability to preserve valuable recordings: it is an issue that has been barely addressed in the mainstream media but is a serious issue. i'm doing my small part by hanging on to my old columbia gramophone from the 1930's which i purchased in 1973 in the flea market in athens, greece (had it shipped around the horn), reel-to-reel, sony and radio shack cassette decks and a walkman, portable and audiophile adcom cd player, my beloved sony 1970's vintage turntable with strobe for manually adjusting the speed), my 1950's vintage kiddie 45rpm player and my 1960's kid 45rpm and 33 1/3 rpm players, a dictation cassette deck, probably some microphones somewhere for the cassete decks, and a collection of recordings - vintage 45s, 33 1/3s (mono and stereo), and a cylinder for an edison cylinder player (although i don't have one of those...yet). rapid planned obsolecence of computers and computer media seems to be an even worse problem than what has happened in audio.

(i never completed the course even though i paid the full $3,000.) i installed a cd rom and sound blaster card in that machine. i went on to build my own. i still have the one from the school even though i don't run it anymore. the one i built is an amd 586. i bought the machine at a second hand store, brought it home and rebuilt it from the motherboard up. since then i have bought several from the second hand store and got them up and running. i got my son interested to doing this and gave him several of the machines to see what he could do with them. he never completed school, but he can get a machine up and running. right now i am a 66 year old still learning how to make the machine do what i want it to. i still run the unix system at work along with doing database management and spreadsheet reports. i have a lot of memories about the experiences i have had with all the machines i have, and i plan to have more in the future.

(new yorkers: remember 47th st. photo?) they had seven in stock when i called, and only 2 left when i got there. i've had a number of other interesting computers, included three i bought from japan laptop direct. did anyone else ever buy from japan laptop direct?
