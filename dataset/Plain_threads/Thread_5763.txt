205	7	3880	54326	50983	ozos	12/1/03 7:16 pm	1.07030616e12	re:thanks, robert!	you may want to check the specs for xp, i cant remember them off the top of my head, but i do know that it does take a fair amount of system rescources compared to something like win98se or winme also, you may wanto contact dfi and check on what kind of agp slot you have before going out and buying a new video card, if its 8x your fine, if its 4x so-so if its 2x i dont know how much more you could upgrade, maybe a few 32mb cards, if the s3 is integrated you have to disable it to use the new video card. unless windows catches on and does that all of the parts u need can be found at various locations on and off the web.
