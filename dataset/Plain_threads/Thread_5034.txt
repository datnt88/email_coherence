218	4	148436	1656465	1656408	mikuhl	1/8/06 11:21 am	1.13671926e12	sorry	ignore my last post. i have been doing some reading, cable select requires a special cable right? since my old drive has no cs setting wouldn't i just set them as master and slave? would this cause any problems? i don't mean to sound like an idiot but it has been 8-10 years since i have done this! somewhere i read that because one is ntfs and the other fat32 there might be problems? thanks mike
