3532	5	593868	5461534	5461494	vapcmd	5/27/13 9:00 pm	1.3696884e12	i always bulid systems with 2 hdds where the second	hdd is strictly backup for the primary drive. in the event the primary drive dies, i replace it and use the data from the backup on the 2nd hdd to restore a full working image to the new primary hdd. then i wipe the original drive and send it for warranty replacement. fast and easy. beats the heck out of finding all the installation discs, the serial numbers, reloading all the sw, setting preferences, etc., makes me tired just thinking of it. vapcmd ps..good choice on the ram !
