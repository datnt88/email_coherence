4820	0	549104	5239991	nr	dezlan	12/2/11 9:45 am	1.3228191e12	is my power supply faulty?	first off my system specs- &lt;span&gt; 8gb kingston, hyperx x2 grey ddr3 ram &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; xfx, radeon hd 6950 1gb gpu &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; samsung 1tb spinpoint sata &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; lite-on, blue-ray disk combo drive &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; msi h67ma-e45 mobo &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; thermaltake tr2 standard 500w power supply- 24 pin &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; intel core i7-2600 quad core 3.4ghz &lt;span&gt; now for my problem- (i don't know a ton about computers, but i'll try to describe it to the best of my ability) a few weeks ago, my pc started cutting off without warning- then it would boot back up and either run fine or cut off again within 10-30 mins. i set my computer to not cut off if it encountered a problem with the ram, instead it would show the blue error screen- haven't seen it yet, so i'm assuming it's not that. i've also heard that software issues can cause a system to fail, so i'm booted into safe-mode at the moment. should i just do a full re-install of windows and see if that helps? a few hours ago, my pc cut off and attempted to reboot and cut off a few seconds into it. then repeat. i had to flip the power switch in the rear to stop the process. is it safe to continue using or should i leave it be until i can figure out the problem? i've heard that power supplies in general can be prone to failing after short periods of time, i've only had this build for about 4-5 months. any help would be great, i'm pretty lost at the moment. &lt;span&gt;
