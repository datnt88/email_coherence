10581	3	508718	5038953	5038943	noblepuker	12/3/10 6:40 pm	1.2914016e12	yes	im not on the geek squad..yet,but from wat i've seen,it defaults to the lowest mhz....yes.

10581	8	508718	5039648	5039654	noblepuker	12/4/10 5:21 pm	1.29148326e12	oops,i meant 267mhz.lol	i can't subtract apparently...your losing 267mhz. my advice doesn't exactly instill confidence.lol
