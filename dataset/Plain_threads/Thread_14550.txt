here is my log from the burn. thanks for any help i get. windows xp 5.1 ia32 winaspi: - ahead winaspi: file 'c:\program files\ahead\nero\wnaspi32.dll': ver=2.0.1.74, size=164112 bytes, created 10/26/2004 5:35:34 pm nero version: 6.6.0.3 recorder: &lt;_nec dvd_rw nd-3550a&gt; version: 1.05 - ha 1 ta 0 - 6.6.0.3 adapter driver: &lt;atapi&gt; ha 1 drive buffer : 2048kb bus type : via inquiry data (1) -&gt; atapi, detected: atapi connected to mmc as unknown drive with class-nr : 1 drive is autodetected - recorder class: std. mmc recorder cd-rom: &lt;liteon dvd-rom ltd163 &gt;version: gdhj - ha 1 ta 1 - 6.6.0.3 adapter driver: &lt;atapi&gt; ha 1 === scsi-device-map === diskperipheral : maxtor 6l080l4 atapi port 0 id 0 dma: off cdromperipheral : _nec dvd_rw nd-3550a atapi port 1 id 0 dma: on cdromperipheral : liteon dvd-rom ltd163 atapi port 1 id 1 dma: on === cdrom-device-map === _nec dvd_rw nd-3550a d: cdrom0 liteon dvd-rom ltd163 e: cdrom1 ======================= autorun : 1 excluded drive ids: writebuffersize: 40894464 (0) byte showdrvbufstat : 0 bufe : 0 physical memory : 255mb (261132kb) free physical memory: 161mb (165648kb) memory in use : 36 % uncached pfiles: 0x0 use inquiry : 1 global bus type: default (0) check supported media : disabled (0) 1.2.2006 burn dvd image 12:38:06 pm #1 text 0 file reader.cpp, line 127 reader running 12:38:06 pm #2 text 0 file writer.cpp, line 122 writer _nec dvd_rw nd-3550a running 12:38:06 pm #3 text 0 file burncd.cpp, line 3151 turn on disc-at-once, using dvd media 12:38:06 pm #4 text 0 file dlgwaitcd.cpp, line 256 last possible write address on media: 2295103 (510:01.28, 4482mb) last address to be written: 2285879 (507:58.29, 4464mb) 12:38:06 pm #5 text 0 file dlgwaitcd.cpp, line 268 write in overburning mode: no (enabled: cd) 12:38:06 pm #6 text 0 file dlgwaitcd.cpp, line 2309 recorder: _nec dvd_rw nd-3550a, media type: dvd+r 12:38:06 pm #7 text 0 file dlgwaitcd.cpp, line 430 &gt;&gt;&gt; protocol of dlgwaitcd activities: &lt;&lt;&lt; ========================================= 12:38:06 pm #8 text 0 file threadedtransferinterface.cpp, line 830 setup items (after recorder preparation) 0: trm_data_mode1 (2 - cd-rom mode 1, iso 9660) 2 indices, index0 (150) not provided original disc pos #0 + 2286030 (2286030) = #2286030/508:0.30 not relocatable, disc pos for caching/writing not required/not required, no patch infos -&gt; trm_data_mode1, 2048, config 0, wanted index0 0 blocks, length 2286030 blocks [_nec dvd_rw nd-3550a] -------------------------------------------------------------- 12:38:07 pm #9 text 0 file threadedtransferinterface.cpp, line 1040 prepare recorder [_nec dvd_rw nd-3550a] for write in cue-sheet-dao dao infos: ========== mcn: &quot;&quot; toctype: 0x00; session closed, disc not fixated tracks 1 to 1: 1: trm_data_mode1, 2048/0x00, filepos 0 0 386822144, isrc &quot;&quot; dao layout: =========== __start_|____track_|_idx_|_ctrladr_|_recdep__________ 0 | lead-in | 0 | 0x41 | 0x00 0 | 1 | 0 | 0x41 | 0x00 0 | 1 | 1 | 0x41 | 0x00 2286030 | lead-out | 1 | 0x41 | 0x00 12:38:07 pm #10 phase 24 file dlgbrnst.cpp, line 1832 caching of files started 12:38:07 pm #11 text 0 file burncd.cpp, line 4038 cache writing successful. 12:38:07 pm #12 phase 25 file dlgbrnst.cpp, line 1832 caching of files completed 12:38:07 pm #13 phase 36 file dlgbrnst.cpp, line 1832 burn process started at 8x (11,080 kb/s) 12:38:07 pm #14 text 0 file threadedtransferinterface.cpp, line 2596 verifying disc position of item 0 (not relocatable, no disc pos, no patch infos, orig at #0): write at #0 12:38:07 pm #15 scsi -1066 file cdrdrv.cpp, line 1176 scsi exec, ha 1, ta 0, lun 0, buffer 0x034f6000 status: 0x04 (0x01, scsi_err) ha-status 0x00 (0x00, ok) ta-status 0x02 (0x01, scsi_tastatus_chkcond) sense key: 0x05 (key_illegal_request) sense code: 0x24 sense qual: 0x00 cdb data: 0xad 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x08 0x04 0x00 0x00 sense data: 0x70 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x0a 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x24 0x00 12:38:07 pm #16 text 0 file dvdplusrw.cpp, line 608 start write address at lba 0 dvd high compatibility mode: no 1:12:23 pm #17 text 0 file writerstatus.cpp, line 116 &lt;_nec dvd_rw nd-3550a &gt; start writing lead-out at lba 2286030 (22e1ceh), lenght 0 blocks 1:12:23 pm #18 text 0 file threadedtransfer.cpp, line 228 all writers idle, stopping conversion 1:12:53 pm #19 phase 37 file dlgbrnst.cpp, line 1832 burn process completed successfully at 8x (11,080 kb/s) existing drivers: file 'drivers\adpu160m.sys': ver=v3.60a (lab01_n(johnstra).010529-2218), size=101888 bytes, created 8/17/2001 3:07:32 pm file 'drivers\pxhelp20.sys': ver=2.02.62a, size=20016 bytes, created 10/28/2003 5:02:00 am (prassi/veritas driver for win 2k) file 'drivers\atapi.sys': ver=5.1.2600.1106 (xpsp1.020828-1920), size=86912 bytes, created 8/29/2002 3:27:50 am (adapter driver for rec) registry keys: hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\winlogon\allocatecdroms : 0 (security option)
