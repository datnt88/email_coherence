9007	1	7656	89781	89622	r. proffitt	1/6/04 3:50 pm	1.0734042e12	i have this usb floppy i use in a pinch. on my machine i can even boot from it.	but the sad truth is that i don't see such a card. the issue here is that a motherboard could cost about the same. what motherboard is this? what cpu and such parts do you need to move over? bob
