4903	3	559552	5292675	5292619	vapcmd	3/29/12 7:36 pm	1.33304976e12	looks like a duplicate port to me...same hw ....like	everyone said...its a little bit of a crapshoot....may work, may not work. trying it will be the only way to tell for sure. upgrading cpus is more for generic clone pcs...not off the shelf boxes from dell, hp, etc., vapcmd

4903	7	559552	5295732	5292675	nveedeverywhere	4/5/12 6:15 pm	1.3336497e12	not a crapshoot	the q6600 installed easily in minutes.. running cool, and running fast
