14757	13	139595	1577213	1577209	albizzia	12/2/05 9:01 pm	1.13355726e12	forgot to mention...	before doing any re-partitioning, make sure you back up vital data, clear out all unwanted/unused files to make as much free space as possible, and defragment. if there isn't sufficient free space on the disk you cannot resize the partition, and if you cannot resize the partition you cannot get empty space for another partiton.
14757	14	139595	1577408	1568028	pksteven	12/3/05 2:34 am	1.13357724e12	you won't	most often you cannot partition a hard drive that is one big partition in xp, simply because you will damage files needed to operate it. througout the hard drive and os, it is configured as one large drive, if you change this, it throws the system out of whack and can destroy your os to where you need to install it again. the whole drive is considered operating \running which you cannot change a partition that is in use by the os. when you install your os you have to create a smaller primary partition, enough for the os to operate. then you can partition the hard drive from disk management since whole drive will not be in use. most partition softwares will warn of even trying this due to the above mentioned. most partition softwares will simply not even attempt it or give you an error message. much like my xp, 80 gig, i had to install xp on a 20 gig portion, then partition from there after xp was installed. i could not accomplish this prior. i don't think your restoration cd is not working due to updated version so much as a problem with the update itself. ((however your system has to support booting from external devices or it won't either way.)) paul

(it is a gateway solo 1450 laptop). when i took the a+ course at devry and copied all the tools available, i had a copy of norton ghost. i don't think it was up to date as it didn't recognize ntfs. xxclone was recommended as an alternative in the future. so, with my internal drive partitioned into three and my external drive partitioned into two, i have all the partitions that i need. thanks for the support.
