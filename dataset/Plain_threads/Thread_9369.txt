12340	8	39335	629296	629291	thermos	12/23/04 3:50 am	1.1037738e12	by the way...	this problem started occuring when my computer goes into stanby over night (cuz i run the puter 24/7 for online game hosting) and the first couple times it occured a simple reboot was all that was required to fix the problem. now nothing i do seems to help. thanks again for any help any of you can give me

12340	10	39335	631338	629947	thermos	12/24/04 2:28 am	1.10385528e12	got it fixed	i had a conflict with irq's, and had to move the internal card to another slot. sounded like ******** to me when tech support told me to do it, but it worked. had to reinstall all the drivers too. on the upside, i finally found out how to get my optical spdif to put out more than just a stereo signal... woohoo! thanks
