(224 without aol commitment) it was a pretty decent system for everyday use. not good for high end graphics and stuff but for your everyday internet browsing, word processing and some low resolution gaming it was almost perfect. so i will say just make the best out of your duron and eyes on the weekly fliers!! just mho
