(from 2600 marks to 2800) in passmark performance test, it reads my cpu speed as 2.044ghz, it should read somewhere around 2.667 ghz  my computer runs perfectly fine (other than im not getting the gaming performance i should be) its a fast, modern computer runs windows 7 beautifully and never hangs. it plays portal 2, cod4, fallout 3, and l4d at around 60 fps or higher, maxed settings at 1920x1080 (thanks to the video card) several other games give me much lower framerates, even at the lowest possible resolutions and settings such as nfs shift (20), dirt 2 (27), and crysis demo (25) i gather from this it is a insufficiency in cpu performance that is the cause. i know i should be getting better results from my processor, what can i do to make it run like it should?

13919	3	529266	5145851	5145617	surfdudeboy	6/9/11 7:19 am	1.30760394e12	no luck on that	i disabled eist, but i didn't find c1e. somehow... it performed worse on the benchmark than with it enabled. i retested it with both settings a few times to make sure. cpuz shows my proccesor at normal stats. 333x8 2.66ghz, but passmark's &quot;measured cpu speed&quot; is always on the low side (and it varies every time i open it) the only other cpu settings i could find in the bios are: cpu function -&gt; execute bit support (disabled), set cpuid maxval to 3 (disabled) i'm not sure what these mean but i will test them out
13919	4	529266	5145860	5145521	surfdudeboy	6/9/11 7:24 am	1.30760424e12	ill have to try 64bit	it could be the 32 bit os slowing it down... but would it really make such a difference? ill have to borrow a friend's 64 bit and see the difference. lol, i kind of have ram from all over the place. i have 2x 512 ocz, 1gb of kingston, and a 512 of.. uh something i know its all 800mhz though, and the startup hardware check thing says its in dual channel mode.ill try just using one stick and see how that goes
