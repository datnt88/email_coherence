10834	9	384541	3256584	3256511	r. proffitt	2/26/10 10:29 am	1.26718014e12	about the static address.	that's been a dead end solution since the child that hijacks the connection often uses smac or similar (google that!) to spoof the connection and interfere with your connection. you can write i didn't have an answer today over and over but the lesson is simple. get a secure link. bob
