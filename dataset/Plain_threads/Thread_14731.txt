(follow this path: run/regedit/hkey_local-machine/hardware/devicemap).if the drive's id is not there, then it is possible that your registry was corrupted when the computer was improperly shut down. in this case, you have two choices of how to fix the problem. either you can use the recovery console from the windows 7 disc to repair the registry or simply uninstall the os and reinstall it again.

ive also heard of a newer website which says it charges a flat rate fee unlike other recover services who charges by the hour but the flat rate website also boasts theres no-charge if no recovery is made except i dont know if it could be a misleading advertisement especially what if only 1 or 2 percent of useless garbled data gets recovered or in other words i suspect data is usually recoverable especially for software problems and in some hardware problems but whether the data is useable or if its useless garbled data remains to be seen. im not the expert but im guessing any losses of data which stems from physical hardware damage has the highest incidences of zero data recovered. although if money was only a small problem then id probably opt for trying a new cable like r. proffitt suggested just to see if maybe its only the cable that got fried from the power surge? if money is no problem at all then id probably choose some other recovery service that offers serious prior-consultation but who also charges by the hour as opposed to the flat rate fee website, but thats just me? on the other hand if i had no money to afford handing the hard drive over to an expert, and aside from the obvious attempts of trying one or more system restore points, then id probably try something like partition magic or other equivalent applications out of curiosity to see if your secondary internal hard drive happens to luckily show up in any of the new applications although for crying out loud what in the world is anyone in their right mind doing with a humongous secondary 1 terabyte hard drive versus my 80mb single-only-hard-drive, ...shame on you!? are you nuts, and im afraid to ask how big yo main primary hard drive must be? and so if i understand things correctly your computer is equipped with an unbelievable amount of a secondary internal backup hard drive but which wasnt used as a backup hard drive plus of which no external backups werent made in time before the mishap occurred and worse of all your case file involves a sudden power outage followed by a power surge which means chances are you have a hardware problem which no amount of software can ever fix but then again the less you fiddled with it then the better the chances for experts to recovery any useable data from your so-called missing hard drive. which now brings to mind kees bakkers multi-funny statement as if kees was secretly talking about people exactly like me as well as bakkers own self or else how could bakker learn of such true wisdom except through repeated experience over and over and over? but the coolest part of this thread was how ferretkeeper immediately rushed to defend on behalf of our poor innocent underdog ch33zer. ch33zer, i wish you well towards recovering any data but if you don't then by all means welcome to the club except im not club president. tsark out.
