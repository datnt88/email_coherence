854	3	537197	5182800	5182667	r. proffitt	8/8/11 4:52 pm	1.31282232e12	no the ipad does not have a card slot.	but since we can put stuff on dropbox it's something we don't miss. i'm unsure what issue there is with itunes. here it works fine. never gave me any trouble. if we dismiss the ipad and it's very nice keyboard, the samsung 7 inch android is a very nice unit and might be had for your price. let me warn you about android cheap tablets. you'll be upset if the android tablet does not have the following. 1. multi touch screen or &quot;cap touch.&quot; do no accept resistive for your first pad. 2. the accelerometer. 3. the mic and front facing camera. 4. android market. 5. wifi and hopefully bluetooth. 6. the usual 800+mhz cpu or the nice new dual core 1ghz machines. bob
