(in 3d games, faster memory will help a little bit to get you more frames-per-second but mostly that's determined by the memory on your video/graphics card.) suppose you want to convert a music cd to mp3 format. with faster memory the conversion could be completed 40 seconds to 1.5 minutes faster. what you must decide is how important is that minute? for most of us, an extra minute or even three minutes simply doesn't matter. but, if you are doing a lot of music, or photos, or video work then the time saved will quickly add up and you will really appreciate that you have a fast processor and fast memory. remember, even the basic dual-core processors and 2gb of ddr2-667 memory will complete the job faster than a high-end processor and memory from 5 years ago !! in the end, it depends on what you want to do on your computer and how much you can afford to spend. good luck!
