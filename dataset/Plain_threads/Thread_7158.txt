11399	3	278654	2672151	2671723	steven haninger	1/6/08 3:08 pm	1.19963208e12	i just highlight the drive from	my computer/properties/system restore and select &quot;settings&quot;. you can't do that? i'm not sure if it makes a difference. i know that if i unplug a drive and use another usb port for it, windows sees it as a new drive and gives it a different drive letter. it also turns on system restore for that drive by default. i can't figure why it thinks its a new drive. does your bios id the drive? if not, i would wonder if windows forgets it saw it once and shuts off sharing.

11399	5	278654	2672274	2672270	steven haninger	1/6/08 6:07 pm	1.19964282e12	also look in device manager for disk drives	and see if shows by model or if generic. mine shows full model #.
11399	6	278654	2672280	2672274	coryphaeus	1/6/08 6:16 pm	1.19964336e12	might be it. . .	device manager only shows usb mass storage device. and this ibm bios does not list the drive. that may be part of the problem, this is an ibm thinkcentre. built for business &quot;stuff&quot;. it's powerful, p-4 3 ghz hyper thread (dual processor) with a gig of ram. sweet machine. i've replaced the 40 gig hd with an 80 gig perpendicular recording seagate and added an lg dual layer dvd burner with lightscribe. customized. but i digress, sorry. it must be something in the way the ibm handles usb drives. no biggie. when i want to back up &quot;stuff&quot; from my other pcs i'll just plug in in each one.
11399	7	278654	2672290	2672280	steven haninger	1/6/08 6:52 pm	1.19964552e12	i believe i had to go into the bios	under usb devices somewhere not have it default to auto with each restart. i've forgotten the process but i had to halt during post and go usb device setting and restart until the drives appeared by model #. i exited and saved the settings. i also can allow more time for usb devices to present themselves. i had to add a few seconds for one of my drives that was a bit slow to spin up. you might see what options you have in your bios to remedy this.
