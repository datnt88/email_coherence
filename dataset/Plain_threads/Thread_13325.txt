10430	9	558621	5298972	5297901	steven haninger	4/14/12 6:18 am	1.33438428e12	my answer was predicated on the router speed	of 10/100 so the speed will depend on the slowest device in the transfer path. i can't see where a usb3 hd would transfer data between his pc and the usb3 hard drive any faster than to a usb2 drive with that network speed limit...at least not detectably.
