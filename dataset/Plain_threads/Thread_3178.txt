9328	3	595321	5468532	5468472	mchainmchain	6/17/13 12:49 pm	1.37147334e12	details matter....	link provided clearly states maximum total amount of memory is 8 gb ram. to achieve maximum read/write potential of cards, and thus highest memory speeds, and with two memory slots available, these two cards must be identical in all respects. a 4 gb ram card in one slot and a 2 gb ram card in another are not identical. a 4 gb card in one slot and an 8 gb card in the second will result in only 8 gb total ram being seen by your system. it does not support 12 gb ram, nor 16 gb ram, but only 8 total gb ram. only thing that is bad about this is that the wasted additional cost of the higher capacity of the 8 gb card never will be fully used, plus it may not work at all in either slot. only fix is to get a motherboard that supports higher gb ram out of the box. more memory slots, the better, meaning, greater flexibility in getting exactly the amount of ram you need. just be aware that changing motherboards will mean a new operating system license for your system will be needed as the operating system in place now is tied to the current motherboard now in use. standard microsoft business practices. first system i had had only 32 mb ram using four sticks. that's right, megabyte s, not gigabytes. worked just fine for what it was. maximum supported ram was 128 mb ram.

9328	7	595321	5468622	5468613	travisdreams	6/17/13 5:51 pm	1.37149146e12	regarding ram	the earlier reply said my maximum memory is 8gb? but you're recommending i get the 2 8gb and install them both which is a total of 16? will my pc be fine handling that? im running a windows 7 home premium 64 bit operating system here's my pc specs page once again:
9328	8	595321	5468598	5468622	vapcmd	6/17/13 7:10 pm	1.3714962e12	according to the asus mb specs...your system	maxes out at 8gb ram.....so the link provided was for 2 x 4 gb dimms of highly rated ram by gskill. this will max out the system and give the best ram performance your system can deliver.  keep in mind mixing ram from different mfgs, different speeds, different capacities, etc., increases the risk of erratic or unstable operations . . so always better not to mix dimms. what do you use the pc for mostly ? vapcmd

9328	11	595321	5468666	5468670	mchainmchain	6/18/13 1:06 am	1.37151756e12	video rendering speed	is dependent on ram capacity and also on how powerful your video card is. another speed limitation is the source hard drive, whether it is a hdd (traditional), ssd, or hybrid drive. the former is the slowest, and the first latter is the fastest. hybrid is in between for data throughput speed. it is dependent to some extent to cpu speed, but the hard drive is your main bottleneck in starting/running programs as the data throughput is much slower than any ram will ever be. changing your video card to a more powerful model will likely mean the psu will need to be upgraded to higher wattage output than the psu now in the system to be able to support the new card. for your needs, replacing both dimms with 4 gb dimms x 2 is the cheapest way to go, short of replacing your system with better memory specs, hard drive support, and a more powerful psu to run that video card. each card is a 4 gb card, to be clear about that, no misunderstandings. be cheap and live with what you have, but replace the existing dimms with the proper ones. remember, once upon a time, 32 mb ram was enough.
