(please correct me if i am wrong.) our decision is, do we buy an intel mac and make it a pc/mac? or do we replace the astro with a budget pc? because the pc is used only for accessing the customer site, we don't even run anti-virus software (which always seemed to gum up the works) and use dial-up; we could do the same with the pc and keep costs and hassle to a minimum. if we got an intel mac, we'd feel the need to protect it, but could use cable to access the internet and make use of pc software like quickbooks. i'm trying to figure out how difficult it is to deal with an intel mac. obviously we are not computer-savvy and have really loved the ibook because it has been so easy for dummies like us.
