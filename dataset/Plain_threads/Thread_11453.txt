(i got it from ebay used) this mac is the farthest away from the router so i guess my next try is to see if i can move the router a little bit closer. i am a newbie to wireless so possibly i have a setting wrong. i did tell the router the mac addresses of all of the computers that i want to connect. any advice? thanks, karen
