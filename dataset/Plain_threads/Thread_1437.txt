10732	0	594784	5465751	nr	akbreezo	6/9/13 11:40 am	1.370778e12	need help with dual wireless networks	hi all, i'm hoping i can explain what we are trying to do without sounding like a complete idiot. doubtful. we have a wireless signal in our house that comes through a service provided router. the troubles come when we try to get internet to our shop which is separate from the house and a couple hundred feet away. we have tried a wireless repeater with no success. my husband ran cat5 such that you can have a wired connection in the shop, but we cannot seem to get a wireless network to work through this connection. at my disposal i have the service provided router, a linksys wireless-g wrt54g v8, and a uspeed wireless-n wi-fi repeater access point range extender . any help would be most appreciated. thanks!
