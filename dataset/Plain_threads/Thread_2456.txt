11114	1	60888	723501	722712	michael geist	1/29/05 5:25 am	1.1069763e12	do you have an unused...	ethernet port in the back of your pc? xp could be reporting it as being unplugged.
11114	2	60888	723766	723501	johnnicholson3	1/29/05 7:39 am	1.10698434e12	ethernet	im sorry, but i dont know where the ethernet port is that probably means i have an unused one
11114	3	60888	723958	723766	michael geist	1/29/05 9:08 am	1.10698968e12	looks something like....	a telephone jack would, but slightly bigger. usually on the back panel of a new pc.
11114	4	60888	724986	723958	johnnicholson3	1/29/05 6:06 pm	1.10702196e12	ethernet/telephone jack	yes, they are both empty is that bad?
11114	5	60888	725105	724986	michael geist	1/29/05 7:33 pm	1.10702718e12	&quot;yes, they are both empty&quot;	it would just indicate that windows is properly reporting that you are not using the ethernet port. since your wireless connection is working, there is no problem.
11114	6	60888	725111	725105	johnnicholson3	1/29/05 7:36 pm	1.10702736e12	but...	it says the wireless connection is working, but i cannot access the internet on that computer
11114	7	60888	725397	725111	gakada	1/29/05 11:13 pm	1.10704038e12	so its not about unpluged cable, but rather a wifi setting.	did you enable dhcp on the router (wap) did you get an ip address? did you use wep or wpa security? have you tried to add your wifi network to this computer? tell us how you install your wifi and the setting you have done.
11114	8	60888	725607	725111	michael geist	1/30/05 4:28 am	1.10705928e12	from this statement....	&quot;the dell has working internet with no problems. i have tried to set up a network (many times) and the wireless connection is fine.&quot; it appears you have a working internet connection.
11114	9	60888	726730	725397	johnnicholson3	1/30/05 1:00 pm	1.10709e12	wrong channel	i had been using dhcp, but i checked and it had not put in the settings correctly. i then stopped using dhcp; i put in the settings without it. i did get an ip address i used wep 128-bit security i tried to install the network on the main computer and it said, &quot;the wizard cannot create a wireles network, either because a wireless network adapter is not installed or because software for the wireless network adapter is not installed.&quot; i just installed it, but i didn't get a choice on what channel to use, and it chose the wrong one (it picked 6, my other computer is using 11) how do i change that?
11114	10	60888	736346	725607	johnnicholson3	2/2/05 8:43 pm	1.10737698e12	.	im sorry, the computer that needs the wireless connection says the wireless connection is fine, but i still have no access to the internet on it the computer that directly connects to the router has working internet
