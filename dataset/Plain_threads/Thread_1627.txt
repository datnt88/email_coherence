3930	9	353825	3105873	3105645	vapcmd	8/18/09 1:16 pm	1.25060136e12	before doing the bios...i'd try my suggestions	first including testing the dimms and contacting gskill. reason ...flashing the bios can leave you doa where normally only a new bios chip can save you. it might be the case a mild bump in voltage for the dimms might help too. vapcmd
