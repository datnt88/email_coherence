7374	5	301444	2813281	2813280	r. proffitt	7/17/08 7:00 am	1.216278e12	and..	sorry about that. i use many nas if i expand beyond office, home and lab. we just don't have that particular unit. some think this is a tech support forum and that moderators are paid to answer questions. that is untrue. these are discussion forums and no one is paid. -&gt; more on point. i know that issue with vendors and why i won't buy if they won't answer simple (to me) questions. why not go to iomega's web site and find the phone number then call? it's what i would have to do. and about asking for owners to know this. even if an owner had it, most are just &quot;owners&quot; that use the product and won't be able to get this technical. i can but i don't own or have access to said unit. i also did not try to research this on the internet (you can do that.) but i do know why people may ask and shared how i was able to retrieve files for what was thought to be a proprietary files system (i booted linux.) bob
7374	6	301444	2813377	2813080	samkh	7/17/08 8:30 am	1.2162834e12	some insights	1. os is linux and fs is ext3 and can be read by linux pcs 2. data is accessible by ip from windows, mac and linux pcs 3. no when you share and map the drive 4. sata (seagate) factory configured stripped but you can re-format to mirror or jbod. web administration. ftp-able. cheapest i have found that can work in a domain. fan a little noisy if you place unit too close to you. iomega (and other vendors) also have windows-based models which cost more. google around.
7374	7	301444	2813408	2813377	pilaar39	7/17/08 8:57 am	1.21628502e12	thanks	yes i know there are other solutions, it is just that i have the opportunity of getting one of these units for free, so i just wanted to see if i could use it on my home network, which includes both pcs and a mac. i am not happy with my current netgear solution, because like i said, it is not accessible from the mac, and because i could not retrieve the data should the sc101 fail (not the drives within it, but the actual sc101 itself) once again, thank for you your response.

7374	10	301444	3217009	2891702	instntpudn	1/8/10 4:44 pm	1.26296904e12	did you ever resolve this issue?	if so how? having the same problem, thousands of dollars worth of data. please let me know asap
7374	11	301444	3217020	3217009	r. proffitt	1/8/10 4:51 pm	1.26296946e12	there is drive savers.com	they can recover striped array data. but you bring up the age old issue of backup. if the files are worth thousands then why not a few hundred buck spare copy? bob
7374	12	301444	3217066	3217020	instntpudn	1/8/10 5:34 pm	1.26297204e12	lesson learned	but i still have the data that i need to get back. with this nas is it possible? or do you think i'll have to use a data recovery service? anyone have any hints on what i should do, i've already tried a data recovery tool on a single disk, but as you know the data is striped across multiple disks...
7374	13	301444	3217156	3217066	r. proffitt	1/8/10 7:05 pm	1.2629775e12	the only time we got it back was	to buy an identical unit and put the drives in the new unit. it was cheaper than drivesavers so i call that a success. also look at the top post to read the lacie miracle. they got some files back but i forget if it was striped. the lacie miracle is a good read about something we should always give a try. bob
