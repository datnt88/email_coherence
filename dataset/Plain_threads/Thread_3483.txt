14125	2	563784	5314329	5314345	john_coller	5/23/12 5:30 am	1.337751e12	why is pc5300 ddr2 dimm not the right one?	i would buy the 'right one' if i was confident of what that is. i would also like to find out if it was my mistake for ordering the wrong memory or the retailer has the wrong information on the memory; wikipedia describes dimm ddr2 as being specifically identifiable by a gap 70mm across (which would fit) and not 73mm. crucial doesn't have the system listed or i would have ordered from them. the motherboard is ms-7301, which supports up to 2gb ddr2 memory. i did a bit of research and can't find any information on different pin positions in dimm ddr2 memory, so i am a bit apprehensive about reordering until i find out so the same mistake isn't made; pc5300 ddr2 dimm should be the right memory.

14125	5	563784	5314379	5314342	bob b	5/23/12 7:16 am	1.33775736e12	maybe maybe	hyf2536481g that shows to be ecc ram. is that what you want? i've never played with the stuff.......perhaps the slot location moves.
