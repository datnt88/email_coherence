9394	0	181545	1984463	nr	dave lorking	6/5/06 6:49 pm	1.14953334e12	audio problems	i just finished building a system with an ultra tower case, an intel d975xbx mobo, a pentium d processor, and an msi radeon 1300 video card. everything works fine, except for the audio. i cannot get any sound our of the back panel ports. aditionally, the front panel audio cables that came with the case are seven cables independently labeled mic power, mic in, ear r, ear r, ear l, ear l, and gnd. because they are inidvidual cables, i don't know how they would map onto the motherboard's audio headers, which are label differently: (pin 1) port1l, (2) gnd, (3)port1r, (4)presence#, (5) port2r, (6) sense1_ret, (7) sense_send, (8) key (no pin), (9) port2l and (10) sense2_ret. no help from either ultra or intel, can someone help? thank you.
