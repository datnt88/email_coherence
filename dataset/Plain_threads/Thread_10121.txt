(obviously), but will still run faster then what you have. first buy one more 1gb stick of ram (that pc can have a max of 2gb and you might as well max it out). secondly, upgrade your processor to a pentium 4 (you can probably find one online for $40 bucks). that should do it. if you have any questions about your processor compatibility here's check this link out --  (but all pentium 4s look to be compatible with a celeron d chipset. regards, -todd
