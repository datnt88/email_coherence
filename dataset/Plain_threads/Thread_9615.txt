1677	9	246403	2480757	2480399	[roc]	5/7/07 4:19 pm	1.17855474e12	didnt know that.................	im not as knowledgable about the specifications about videocards as u guys. the way i compared how the 7900's in sli would be faster is, i just doubled the clock speeds and compared it to the single 8800, but i guess i was wrong. if the 8800's indeed are that fast i have have no problem purchasing one of them or even sli'ing it later. cool, now i learned something new. isnt pc gaming so much fun (and lots of $, lol).

1677	11	246403	2480799	2480757	ramarc	5/7/07 4:47 pm	1.17855642e12	re: didn't	the 8800gts/320mb starts to stumble at high resolutions. however at resolutions below 1920x1200, the 8800gts is as fast as a 7950gt (dual 7900gtxs). so unless you've got a 24&quot; widescreen or larger, one 8800gts/320 will smoke two 7900gs cards.
