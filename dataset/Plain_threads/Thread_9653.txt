(btw i have vista home premium) any ideas? if i need to buy a new router that isn't a problem. these are the routers that are &quot;approved&quot; so to speak: # netgear wnr834b # linksys wrt300n # buffalo wzr-g300n thanks folks. ya'll have been very helpful in the past and appreciate that very much!

4059	6	238649	2434206	2433298	krvach	3/18/07 8:36 am	1.17420696e12	hmmm.	well, that could be a problem seeing as how i have a dell wireless card. i know on the dell website they advertise/sell linksys, netgear, and d link. my girlfriend and myself often send files over the network to each other. i know that using a usb drive would probably solve my problem, but just wondering what your folks thought? has anyone had good experiences with the dell draft-n card and a particular router? btw thanks bob for all of your help!
4059	7	238649	2434261	2434206	samkh	3/18/07 9:43 am	1.17421098e12	if you are anxious	to buy a compatible draft-n router now versus using g until n is ratified, search for connect with centrino routers since your dell card is intel's n.
4059	8	238649	2434327	2434261	krvach	3/18/07 10:54 am	1.17421524e12	awesome thanks.	hey thanks! do we have a timeline until n is ratified?
4059	9	238649	2434331	2434327	samkh	3/18/07 11:25 am	1.1742171e12	it may be a little easier	than trying to guess when the fed will lower interest rate, but still risky to bet on it. judge for yourself if this appears to be a fast action group.

4059	12	238649	2436679	2432524	krvach	3/20/07 5:00 pm	1.17441e12	so here's the verdict.	hi folks. i just got off the phone with a couple of dell technicians, and i was told that the reason that my network is bouncing is because of my belkin router. so i have to go out and buy a new one. here is my question for all of you. now i have a belkin router that isn't going to be used. is there a way to hook both up so that i can extend my wireless signal? i know that's pretty silly to ask, but i am just trying to find something to do with the belkin. thanks folks.
4059	13	238649	2452938	2436679	yothenberg	4/7/07 9:37 am	1.17593862e12	updating the belkin firmware	this may be a little late but i had problems with my belkin pre-n router dropping connections. i updated the firmware and the problems went away. i wasn't connecting using pre-n or draft-n cards, i was using d-link g and apple b cards but the new firmware solved the problems. my belkin pre-n router has been rock solid ever since. you can download the firmware update from here:  . the latest firmware version is 1.01.03. you can see what version you currently have on your router if you hit the router's internal webserver. instructions for updating the firmware are in the manual on page 69. this may not solve your problems because you are connecting to a pre-n router with a draft-n card from different manufactures but it may allow you to drop down to g/b speeds reliably. cheers, y
