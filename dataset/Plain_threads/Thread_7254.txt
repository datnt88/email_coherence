393	7	401762	3353957	3353838	mrmacfixit	8/8/10 6:24 am	1.28124864e12	what software did you use on you old mac tower?	when you burn a disk using the os, it is a once only burn where the disk is finalized on completion of the burn. this has been the case since os burning has been available on the mac. to have multiple sessions, you need third party software, like toast. what version of toast came with the lacie? toast 8, 9 & 10 all work on your version of the os. do you get error messages when you installed the software or when you try to use the software? using toast, you can add files to a cd/dvd after you have burned the first set of files but, by default, toast does not have that option turned on. you have to select it before you burn. i thought you were looking for a dvd burner that was not a lacie? p

393	11	401762	3354158	3354107	mrmacfixit	8/8/10 2:01 pm	1.28127606e12	that's it exactly,	pick the write session option and you will be able to add files to the disk. note that the disk will appear on the desk top for each of the sessions. for example. if you put some files on the disk for session 1, then use the disk again, adding files, for session 2, and again with session 3, when you insert the disk it will appear on the desktop as three different cd's, all with the same name. p
