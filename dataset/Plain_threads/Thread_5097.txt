(i'm not a big gamer). what i find most interesting is the lcd moniter comes with it - 19'', not too shabby. here's my question...it says i can watch tv on it. i've asked around and gotten no real answers on this. can i watch this like a regular tv? is it going to show as full screen or just a pop-up window i have to maximize? would i just be better off getting a tower and hooking it up to one of my other flat screen tv's? anyone with any information on the media center bundle, please let me know the real story on it. thanks in adavnce!

11105	13	154753	1781186	1780805	whyfi	3/1/06 12:43 pm	1.14121698e12	hp tech chat	i just talked to them and they said that adding a card wouldn't change the functionality of the pvr, so no need to buy a card with a tuner... the card that i'm thinking of getting is the ati radeon x800 xl pci-e. it seems to be pretty well received for the money, and i see that compusa has them in stock for 199.99... if i happen to find an additional rebate/coupon, it might seal the deal!

11105	16	154753	1822601	1821748	mustbuypc	3/21/06 5:44 pm	1.14296304e12	splitter help	if you went to radio shack (or some place cheaper, maybe even walmart), they should tell you what you need in a splitter. essentially you need a splitter with three inputs and three coaxial cables (your pc should come with one). the coaxial cable from the wall that originally connected to the modem is now connected to the splitter. another coaxial cable goes from the splitter to the modem and the other goes from the splitter to the coaxial connection on the back of the hp. when you open up the media center, there is an option to configure your'' television'' settings and after i did that it worked. please write again if you need more help. i'm not sure if it matters what cable you have as i am using comcast.
