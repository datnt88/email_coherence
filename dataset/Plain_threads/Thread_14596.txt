(re dial-up internet access: for 'grins', i occasionally run pcanywhere 'host' on one computer to connect to the internet and then browse from another pcanywhere 'client' computer via the wired network. kludgey and not exactly super fast, but it works ! of course, until i get broadband cable or dsl, i'll probably also want to try this wirelessly for 'grins.') many thanks, tom
