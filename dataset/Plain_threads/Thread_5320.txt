( this will be your login, unless you change your lan ip address. if you change it then, click start, click run click command, type ipconfig /all and look for the default gateway. this will be your new number to put in the address bar to log in.) once your in, you can either use the setup wizard or configure it yourself. ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/wgr614v4_install_guide.pdf firmware update is found here  rick
