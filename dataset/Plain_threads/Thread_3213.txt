(such as  ) my point is, i want to make this as easy as possible while still maintaining a decent connection between both computers. i could probably just unhook my mac from the cable modem and connect my laptop to it, but i don't feel like doing that everyday, i don't want to have to go through comcast tech support and software installation, and i don't want to be stuck in my home office with no work space. sorry if i confused anyone, but i really need help before i go out and purchase anything. any suggestions would be appreciated p.s.: whatever the solution may be, i need to be able to access the internet from at least 1 story above where i am now
