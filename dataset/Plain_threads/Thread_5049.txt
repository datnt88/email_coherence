(mind you that i custom build my machine and i run 64 bit windows 7 rc) however i think that the geforce 9500 1 gb card might be better because it has more dedicated graphics memory, and it should be able to play games for many more years to come.

12487	5	357633	3120103	3119675	justin9640	9/5/09 7:50 am	1.252137e12	did some research	both cards are pretty good however from the info on tigerdirect.com the 9800 card is much better. however with that said it is about 50 bucks (us) more. read the info below. geforce 9500 gt 1 gb  geforce 9800 gtx 512 mb
