5515	0	597707	5479539	nr	robie7642003	7/22/13 12:22 pm	1.37449572e12	will my system work with these graphics cards?	i'm about to install a radeon 7770 graphics card. (considering gtx 650 ti, but there is a huge cost difference now.) current build is amd a6-3500 llano 2.1ghz msi a55m-p33 fm1 amd a55 (hudson d2) micro atx amd motherboard with uefi bios 850 power supply (i know it's a lot--what was available on quick notice) 4 gb memory i'm wondering if the cpu is good enough for gaming, or will i need to upgrade the cpu. games are guild wars 2 fallout 3 gta iv minecraft chivalry midieval warfare thanks.
