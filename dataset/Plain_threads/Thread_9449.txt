10400	4	110099	1252504	1252484	mouse8b	6/19/05 3:21 pm	1.11919446e12	this is how the install happened	i had the original xp cd without the service packs. i slipstreamed sp2 into the windows installer then burned it again. after booting from the cd i pushed &quot;enter&quot; to do a clean install, as opposed to &quot;r&quot; for a recovery. at the point where i was to select where to install windows, i selected the c drive, which had been newly formatted the maxtor utility. the installation showed that i had lots of unpartitioned space on the e drive. i installed windows on the c drive, letting windows format the drive. when the install was complete, i went to my computer and found a 128 gb drive that was unformmattted. i loaded knoppix, which found all of my data just fine. is there a program out there (preferably freeware) that can recreate the file table i am assuming was deleted? or make windows read the files on the drive?

(btw, if it matters, i left out a word, it should have been: &quot;which had been newly formatted by the maxtor utility&quot;)
