12188	8	381476	3243800	3243737	chiman2	2/9/10 2:09 pm	1.26572454e12	i swear you dont pay attention.	i am not using wireless, i dont care about my ssid, i dont care about wireless security because wireless is off. i am on a wired connection.......geez
12188	9	381476	3243861	3243800	r. proffitt	2/9/10 3:30 pm	1.2657294e12	that helps!	but i did read your post. here it is -&gt; i am having the exact same problem with the same router. no matter what security setup i have played with, i haven't been able to make it stop disconnecting me. this wasn't too big of an issue until i hooked up my new ps3. it drops connection about every other match. i have been debating just buying a new router even though i can't afford it. i've been looking for a solution for about 6 months now and still havent found one. i'm even up to date on the firmware. not a word about wired, wifi or settings. no make, model, firmware version. the forum sticky does cover the firmware issue but without the details you may only get &quot;check the forum sticky.&quot; bob

12188	12	381476	3243924	3243922	chiman2	2/9/10 5:55 pm	1.2657381e12	sorry...	sorry..that was an old pic. i just checked now and the wireless is off...i do not torrent so that can not be it.
12188	13	381476	3243926	3243924	r. proffitt	2/9/10 6:08 pm	1.26573888e12	ok, what makes you sure its the router?	let's get rid of another issue. power and heat. i've found routers and dsl modems buried under books cooking away. also we are never sure of the power so put it on some ups. the dsl modem can be the failure point which i used to loan out my old but stable modem to sniff that out. sorry about the person jumping into your discussion and me missing that you came back. at this point it's something of a mystery what it is. ok. no torrents. then again we had that member the swore up and down no torrents. just limewire. ouch, bob
