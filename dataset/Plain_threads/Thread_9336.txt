(tip: microsoft doesn't do this!) bob

1793	13	40597	477739	477044	r. proffitt	10/12/04 5:18 pm	1.09760148e12	here's what i'm reading...	the dw-u18a see discussions like this... &quot;only use discs that the writer does like. the solution here is to stop using the dvd-r discs that don't work. a firmware update probably will not help you because your current firmware is not old enough to be significantly improved upon by a firmware update.&quot; 1. are you using dvd-r? 2. did it ever work? 3. with what make/type media? 4.  looks like you are not alone. i'd get another model, but do try dvd+rw or dvd-rw until you sort it out. have you been talking to the supplier? bob
