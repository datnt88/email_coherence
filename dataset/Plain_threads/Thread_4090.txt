(  ) i only have this 1 post just to warn u lol. i suggest going with a big company that you can 100% trust like dell or hp or something. - i hope you dont get ripped off &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
5784	4	532776	5201414	5161810	stillts	9/11/11 8:13 pm	1.31577198e12	get your facts straight	i agree with you what your saying pat, and in fact this is my first post also, so watch out, lol. i'm personally not an active member on cnet just like pat or agabum, i just found this the same way pat did, by googling ironside computers. this was the first thing that came up, so take my post for whatever it's worth. in this case with ironside computers i can definitely say they are a legit company. i'm in the las vegas area, and i've had them building computers for me for almost 4 years now. the reason you don't see many review is because they've only recently begun selling online, and if your ever in the las vegas area just go check them out for yourself. they're located in southwest las vegas by rainbow and robindale. one last thing pat, are you seriously recommending dell and hp. most people looking for companies like ironside are trying to get away from those companies, lol. those big name companies simply just don't care about their customers. you can see what i mean by checking out resellerratings.com.

5784	8	532776	5436855	5200846	oldskooldev	3/14/13 8:29 pm	1.36329294e12	good advice	i was looking at ironside and saw this thread. i hadn't even noticed it, but went back and googled and found that every positive review was by a person who'd written only 1 post and usually joined the same day. it's been 1.5 years since patisdabest pointed this out and situation seems to be the same. i haven't bought a computer from them - maybe they're completely legit, but these endorsements don't feel right...
