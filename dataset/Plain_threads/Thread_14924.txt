12520	4	534709	5171502	5170844	vinaximus	7/22/11 9:45 am	1.3113279e12	get these	not going into much technical detail choose any one of the following 1) radeon hd 6870 : or 6950 for more power 2) any 80 plus certified psu minimum 550w :corsair and antech are good choice hd 6870 is a decent card. my brother has it (with intel i7) and plays all kinds of new games in hd monitor (1920x1200), with all details maxed and at decent frame rates: get a good psu. 80 plus means 80% effeciency or higher. corsair, antech and cooler master is a good choice.
12520	5	534709	5171694	5170844	bob b	7/22/11 2:01 pm	1.31134326e12	the problem with gaming is	if your serious about this stuff it's a never ending quest for one or two more fps or to get rid of that very slight lag. i have no idea what size/type psu you have now.......so just winging it.  assuming that fits in the machine it should carry you through most future upgrades. the hd 6670....as mentioned...is quite a jump from where you are and may be a simple video card swap with no psu upgrade needed. might be worth a look..........depends how high up the gaming ladder you want to go.
