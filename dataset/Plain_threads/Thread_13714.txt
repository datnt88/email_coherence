1608	4	244638	2469310	2469273	gern47	4/25/07 8:36 am	1.17749016e12	thanks. but no luck so far.	thanks for the link. i read the directly relevant parts of the tech document, then went and allowed/enabled everything in both icmp-related areas of the ethernet controller's settings. still no luck. and to further explore bypassing the ping problem alltogether and instead relying on the file sharing applications, i tried searching for the mac's shared folder in the network places (under the miramar file sharing component of the network places), but i coulnd't find it. i tried creating a new share point there and hard-coded the mac's ip address, but that didn't work either. so i'm currently downloading the minime version of the current release pclinuxos live cd and will burn it and carry it over and try it. any ideas where to find the ping feature there?

(and another paragraph of text that disappeared too fast to read)&quot;, then it went into the grey screen of death (i.e., nothing but a blank grey screen).

1608	9	244638	2469496	2469442	gern47	4/25/07 11:30 am	1.1775006e12	more info, please?	i've looked into ubuntu, but unlike pclinuxos and knoppix, it doesn't appear to download a burnable, bootable iso. do you know any different? and i'm sure you'll understand why i'm going to stay away from pclinuxos 2007 tr3, since the other recent version doesn't even boot properly on my pc. so, unless you tell me differently about a directly burnable, bootable ubuntu iso, i'll stick with knoppix unless you know a reason not to do that.

1608	13	244638	2470098	2469554	gern47	4/26/07 2:55 am	1.1775561e12	a hardware problem is the most likely explanation, but...	critical new info -- the macintosh is at fault. i finally got the chance to borrow someone's laptop and tried, one after the other, connecting to the two primary machines. i tried talking to the mac first, using windows on the laptop, and the symptoms were the same as always. then i decided to boot up the live cd of knoppix on the laptop, just to make sure the problem wasn't windows, and that failed too. so i connected to the main pc running windows xp with knoppix on the laptop, and lo and behold, it worked perfectly! that also gave me a way to test all the cables, and all of them are working fine, and naturaly we now know the d-link switch is working right, also. i sincerely thank everyone who's helped get me this far! now: can anyone help me solve the mac's problem without without investing more money into this old mac? please recall that i've already tried two different nics in the mac: one asante and one dayna. all indications are that the dayna is working better. so how about we proceed for the time being on the assumption that the mac's dayna nic is working, and that there's some software problem? i don't have a third nic to try. everyone's embedding them in their mobos these days. but if in a few days the problem remains, then i will buy a new nic for the macintosh.
