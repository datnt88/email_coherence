( the enclosure operates perfectly when plugged into the hub, i can read and write to the drive). when i plug enclosure directly into usb port on the computer xp does not find it. i have unplugged hub and used same port. i only have two ports on computer even though xp says i have 4. (maybe two more in case?) i have used system restore, uninstalled hub, etc. when i plug in hub xp find hub no problem but not the enclosure. i am lost.. can anyone please help?? thanks

536	9	10971	128680	128656	r. proffitt	2/9/04 11:05 am	1.0763247e12	did you follow all of the guide?	at the bitter end of the guide is where the advice is to just install a pci usb card. i bail out fast on that in the shop and office since those cards are 10 bucks and service costs more than that. bob
