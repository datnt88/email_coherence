9915	2	291237	2749923	2749936	gta333	4/12/08 5:00 am	1.2079764e12	right...	windows xp professional sp2 motherboard msi k8n neo4 athlon 64 3500+ ati radeon x800xl 256mb 80gb sata hard disk (dont know the manufacturer) the memory sticks are super talent 184-pin ddr dimm capacity: 1 gb frequency: 400 mhz data rate: pc-3200 cl: 3 and 2x 512 mb 184-pin ddr dimm kapacitet: 512 mb frekvencija: 400 mhz data rate: pc-3200 cl: 2.5 hopefully, this will help i also have some problems with one of the fans, it keeps on making noises...could this be the solution, a fixed fan?

9915	4	291237	2749927	2749948	gta333	4/12/08 5:15 am	1.2079773e12	its not 754	but socket 939

9915	6	291237	2749929	2749951	gta333	4/12/08 5:25 am	1.2079779e12	crap...	so i threw away 70$ just like that?
9915	7	291237	2749959	2749929	r. proffitt	4/12/08 5:30 am	1.2079782e12	or you get a second stick?	i see it as you got some benefit but don't expect anything huge here. you are past the point where you get big payoff. bob
9915	8	291237	2750071	2749929	samkh	4/12/08 8:43 am	1.20798978e12	yep, and before you throw	away more money on another stick, consider upgrading mobo/cpu/memory combo to a dual core and ddr2. if you live anywhere near a fry's, they run combo deals every week that almost beats any ddr upgrades to single core systems.
9915	9	291237	2750182	2749923	vapcmd	4/12/08 11:16 am	1.20799896e12	as i read the product specs...that's not one of the	recommended ram combinations. i wenth wit 2-1gb dimms (ocz4002048eldcpe-k) vs 4-512mb dimms and it worked well.  vapcmd
