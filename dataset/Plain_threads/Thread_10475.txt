6441	7	46917	556395	556389	r. proffitt	11/20/04 7:49 pm	1.10098014e12	what are &quot;drive!is&quot;?	is that some program you installed? i've seen many zombie dvd drives. ones that don't see dvd and others that see dvd, but not cdrom. you can find these posts here. if it shows a drive letter and works with cd, then the cable, master, slave and ide is likely just fine. many owners grasp for hope the drive can be saved... in closing, you can try uninstalling then installing your dvd software player. bob
