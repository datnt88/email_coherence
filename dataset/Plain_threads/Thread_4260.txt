5004	6	148703	1684585	1673555	danaranda	1/19/06 7:29 pm	1.13769894e12	same thing happened to me	i just got the same card w/250 watts and the only time it turns off the monitor is in high end video games or when i was doing 3dmark video test. i'm came upon this thread as i was trying to trouble shoot the problem. i have a 400 w psu, hopefully it works.
