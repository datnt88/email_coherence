12238	4	286199	2720778	2720762	jelley	3/3/08 1:23 pm	1.20455058e12	response	in the 80's i worked with top quality hp laserjets at my job. in the 90's i owned an okidata laser printer (forgot the model) that cost me a couple hundred, but it was solid stuff, printed 6ppm - smooth, no problems. then it became discontinued (why??) and that was that. i couldn't get new cartridges, had to discard it. then a few years ago, i bought a used hp 6l laser (now in my basement, still functioning, still some toner left, but very slow at printing). i'm seriously considering bringing it back upstairs, because it's quiet, not a power guzzler and i can feed sheets individually. i may get rid of the samsung if i can, despite its 12ppm. why should i hold onto something that consumes as much power as a blowdryer each time i use it, and wait for it to warm up just to shoot out the very few pages i usually need? i think some of the worst villains are companies such as underwriters labs and energystar (the latter approves toxic lcds & hdtvs). they shouldn't just approve products only on the basis of electric operation or energy efficiency! what about toxins! as an aside, i have an energystar kenmore sbs fridge, yet it seems to be running all the time (so much for energy savings). as far as i'm concerned, the ul & energystar labels are worth zilch.
