[both types are actually called ide drives, which can make things a little confusing.] so let's be certain we know the final intended configuration of drives of all types before we dive in. also go to the hp site and look at the photos of the interior assembly of your particular model. i'll be going there to look also at what it's present configuration is. if in the meantime you complete the operation based on the guidance provided by others, email me via my profile to let me know that you are done. lol have you ever checked toni h.'s site for help in general?

[its also jumpered as cs, which simply means that the cable decides what drive is the master and which is the slave]. in your case we need to know what other drives [burners etc] there are and what ide port they are connected to.
