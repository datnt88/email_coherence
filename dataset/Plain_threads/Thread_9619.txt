(i know, it's a pain in the butt. when i travel i'd much rather carry a few dvds and watch them on the hotel's tv rather than pay $6 for a movie.) there are some hacks for windvd that will turn off this feature. you could also rip the dvd to disk and remove the copy protection. but i don't think we discuss stuff like that in this forum. (google)
