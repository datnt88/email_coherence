6451	2	131922	1488061	1488032	mykl	10/21/05 6:15 am	1.1298753e12	advice	i tried to plug everything into a us power strip then i plugged the strip cord into a radio shack converter. i ended up hearing a buzzing sound through the computer speakers and then heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound before the circuit blew on the wall outlet. do you think i damaged the computer? i fear i may need a new power supply for the computer but how can i tell? also, any recommendataions on where to get power cords/step down converters for the desktop in the uk? thanks for your help.
