6311	6	59579	724127	707366	teknewbie	1/29/05 10:18 am	1.10699388e12	still stuck	after i make new partition what do i do, i trie to format from dos but couldnt so i used win 98 cd because i do not have enough memory to run win 2000 and the hard drive still only came up showing 7.82 gig's. btw the option i was to choose when it was time to make new partition was make primary dos partition correct?

6311	8	59579	725951	725429	r. proffitt	1/30/05 7:26 am	1.10706996e12	no help i fear.	from what i can tell you have a many year old machine with a bios that may not understand large drives. you'll want to try some 32gb drive, then under 64gb drive to see where its limit is. bob
