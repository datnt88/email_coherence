5305	6	28552	324845	324743	r. proffitt	7/8/04 5:52 pm	1.08930912e12	yes. it can cost.	more than a new printer even, but some want the paper. i won't write that what i saw on my manual was worth keeping (oops, i just did.) at least it's possible to replace the manual, but seeing its a gift, maybe just like a gift horse, don't look the gift horse in the _____. bob
