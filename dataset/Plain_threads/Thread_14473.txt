13377	8	285590	2715801	2715755	macbook man	2/26/08 9:33 pm	1.20406158e12	better deal but come on	omg apple should include the remote. i mean you are already paying higher prices then for a normal pc with the same stats, and apple had to go to all the trouble as to remove a tiny remote. just include it already. its 20 bucks how much money does apple need. i mean, i dont care as much about how much it is to add on, it could be 1 dollar for all i care. the principal is that you have to buy it separately. and why is it included with the imacs then. well whatever, but yes the 400 dollar 4 gig a ram is nice. 850 had no chance of selling. fyi amazon sells four gigs of memory for the macbook for 113 bucks

13377	12	285590	2716423	2716348	beatlemegafan	2/27/08 1:55 pm	1.2041205e12	right	you don't need the remote if you don't plan on using it. if you do, $20 is not a lot to shell out for when you are buying apple products. and then, look at the things apple has cut prices on: notebook ram, hd costs, and of course, the notebook models themselves. it is indeed quite fair. -bmf
13377	13	285590	2716584	2715409	fbbbb	2/27/08 5:24 pm	1.20413304e12	i guess they did research	i'm betting most people wouldn't use it, because front row is somewhat of a joke when it comes to genuine htpc-style use... so it's perhaps used as a 'look how cool this is' feature for the first two months and then cast aside by most. there is also a design issue as well, in that it's almost shaped like an expresscard remote but isn't. (you can now get apple remote clones which fit into the expresscard slot) the remotes of my xps m's click into the card slot so it's just the thing to take away along with the notebook so i can enjoy vista media center on the move. so with the apple remotes, you kind of have to find a place to put it which isn't on the notebook and that's kind of inelegant. the remote is not what i thought was janky. it is kind of superfluous, although given apple's mumblings towards 'digital hub' i guess a media remote wouldn't be too much to ask. however since their htpc attempt isn't a serious offering, i guess it *is* too much to ask. but i digress. the omission of the remote isn't janky. the ethernet dongle for the air? now that's janky.

13377	19	285590	2729421	2728931	beatlemegafan	3/14/08 5:20 pm	1.2055152e12	not necessarily	true it's expensive and for today's standards, it is viewed as under-powered. but, i am beginning to like this idea. it isn't supposed to powerful, it's supposed to be mobile. throw that together with one of the best operating systems and all the necessary applications for editing and whatnot, and it's a great tool to have. the market the air is aimed at is relatively small, but that hasn't affected the strong sales. today, most people see any computer with under 2.0ghz as a terrible machine, but the clock speed does not completely define the computer. compared to its competition, the air is more powerful even if it only has &quot;1.6 or 1.8ghz&quot;. if unsupported power macs clocking in at around 400mhz can run leopard at a somewhat normal speed, than this thing is even more powerful. i think you have to give apple some credit for putting this together. the air isn't supposed to have all of the other features that the rest of the mac family has. and, it's not supposed to be a primary machine for most people, but i'm sure that you could make it one . -bmf
13377	20	285590	2729490	2729421	me, myself and you	3/14/08 7:55 pm	1.2055245e12	are you sure?!	leopard's requirements are a g4 867mhz.
13377	21	285590	2729816	2729490	beatlemegafan	3/15/08 9:07 am	1.20557202e12	sure about what?	several people around the net have reported success with installing leopard on many, many unsupported macs, meaning they have g4 (or g3) cpus clocking under the 867mhz mark. some people have managed to install it on their powerbook g3s (pismos with g4 upgrades), which is pretty good for an eight/nine-year-old notebook. i was just pointing out that if far older technology can run the same system as the air at a reasonable speed and usability, than the air should have no trouble whatsoever for basic tasks. the air has a lot of potential. in time, users looking for a ssd will be able to get it cheaper. firewire might be added to its small array of ports. apple did patent something like that for more ports awhile ago... the air is only on its first generation, so there's a lot of room for improvement. just give it time. the first ipods were mac-only and did not work very well as i recall. the latest ipods support windows and run very smoothly. just wait . -bmf
