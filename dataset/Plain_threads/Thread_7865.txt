9516	6	582353	5409048	5409039	r. proffitt	1/9/13 2:37 pm	1.35774222e12	it only affected the one wap.	your posts seem to want to engage me in some other topic about credentials and more. let's help this member now. the bad device/pc was easy to find since only that wap was showing connection issues. we used the old binary search method to find it. as a seasoned tech you may know this one. you install a wap in the area and you put half of the users on one and the other on the new wap. if there is a troubled pc it will be in that wap that has troubles. so from 15 or less pcs we're down to 7 or 8 and we only have a few more moves to find the machine. then we can swap out that machine and see if we got it. bob
9516	7	582353	5409049	5409039	r. proffitt	1/9/13 2:43 pm	1.35774258e12	ps. about why we banned 802.11b.	since the waps can't stay at full speed we lose a lot of possible bandwidth. if we did encounter a need for 802.11b it would be a simple matter to put a wap in for just that area for the 802.11b device. for the time that an 802.11b spends on air, the 802.11g devices could have moved about 5 times as many bytes as the 802.11b device. i don't want to upset you but has anyone told you about this? bob
