2128	1	515906	5075992	5075333	r. proffitt	2/3/11 12:06 pm	1.29673476e12	it seems others are discussing this.	just so you know those codes you supplied are usually meaningless and clutter. i find these errors to be heat, bad ram, bad settings, bad driver or an infection of the os. i've yet to find those codes to help anyone. bob

2128	5	515906	5076644	5076217	anjelo31	2/5/11 2:32 am	1.29687312e12	got it	ok i think i know the problem, my pc is overheating,,, well im not sure what hardware is,,, i put a fan on the mobo then problem gone... gpuz, core temp seems normal, but i doubt the results though.,.
2128	6	515906	5076756	5076644	r. proffitt	2/5/11 7:56 am	1.29689256e12	when heat issues are involved.	the codes are all over the map. given your story but telling me you don't know what hardware is, i'm unsure if you want to discuss replacing heat sink compound. bob
2128	7	515906	5077043	5076756	anjelo31	2/5/11 3:53 pm	1.29692118e12	confuse	yeah im unsure which is which, heat sink of what the cpu? to be honest i dont know how to remove the fan and apply thermal compound to the gpu
2128	8	515906	5077047	5077043	r. proffitt	2/5/11 3:58 pm	1.29692148e12	then get help.	if articles on the internet only confuse you then get help from friends that do this. again, with some thousand videos and how many web pages on this, given the risks of breaking the machine maybe it's best to have it done? bob
