5372	2	361947	3140769	3140755	imaginarywhale.	10/2/09 6:16 pm	1.25450736e12	i get it.	i understand that what the manufacturer states as the battery life is not the real deal. but at the very least, the netbook should last at least 6 hours while being used as an e-reader (which will probably be my primary use) or for note taking.
5372	3	361947	3141019	3140769	r. proffitt	10/3/09 5:04 am	1.25454624e12	let's find a 12 hour life and keep in mind that	the batteries are only 300 cycle units so that in one year the battery will need replacement. this is not hearsay, conjecture but reality and real world testing. the e-reader is very close to what we use the machines for. while it is a presentation either with adobe reader or powerpoint we get 1/2 to less the hours that you see from the maker and reviews. look for 12 hour units like the nokia booklet 3g. bob

5372	6	361947	3141351	3141258	imaginarywhale.	10/3/09 12:19 pm	1.25457234e12	oops.	sorry, i've been so unclear! i never meant 6 hours without a break. i would use the netbook uniquely for each class. meaning, in one class i would use it as an e-reader for about 1.25 hours. and then perhaps an hour break, and on to my next class, where i would use it to take notes for another 1.25 hours. then, another half hour break. and so on. i just wouldn't want my netbook to die out on me on a day where my classes last from 8 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon. i'd also like to check my email every now and then, so kindle's a no-no for me.

(?). i wouldn't trade my samsung netbook for anything!
