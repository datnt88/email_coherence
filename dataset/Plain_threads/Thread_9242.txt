7641	9	328653	2971142	2971107	phntm3	2/4/09 12:11 pm	1.23374946e12	i mean...	i wondered if they were paired, as in 2 of the same video cards linked together. i'm not up on the sli/crossfire technologies, so i don't know how else to explain it. i just wanted to make sure that the data was from a standalone card and not 2 of them linked together. i don't have 2 pci-e slots...so i can only put one in there, nor do i feel like upgrading this pc much more other than a new video card and maybe power supply. next time i'm making one.
7641	10	328653	2971460	2971141	ramarc	2/4/09 5:43 pm	1.23376938e12	the hd 4830 would require a new power supply	but the hd 4670 shouldn't. video card power supply recommendations are estimates. the hd 4670 does not require a pci-e connector -- it draws all of it's power from the pci-e slot. a pci-e slot must provide up to 75 watts of power so generally if a card doesn't have a seperate power connector, it doesn't need a big power supply either. gateway uses pretty good power supplies so i'd leave it be. here's an article on the actual power draw of pcs using various video cards (as you can see, the hd 4670 only draws 60w and thus doesn't require a seperate pci-e power connector):  p.s.: the benchmarks are sent earlier are for single card configurations.
