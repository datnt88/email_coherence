14512	2	58157	1126100	691321	jcalder	4/14/05 7:34 pm	1.11350724e12	same exact symptoms here	same drive, ritek dvd-r 4x blanks (same pack i'd used last summer to burn 40 discs without a single coaster), and nero. i get errors using roxio 6 classic too, so i don't think i can blame the apps, although i still can't eliminate xp as the cause (may be the first time i've tried burning dvds since i installed sp2...) but maybe i'm clutching at straws. at this point, i'm about ready to drop $40-$50 for a 16x drive :^o
