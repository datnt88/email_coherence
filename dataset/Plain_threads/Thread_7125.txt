1967	2	112781	1281174	1281138	magicboy000	7/5/05 3:30 pm	1.1205774e12	what's the multiplier?!?!	first: what's the multiplier?!?!! second: what is the bios defaults??! do u mean &quot;load fail safe defaults&quot; in the setup menu?!!
1967	3	112781	1281177	1281174	r. proffitt	7/5/05 3:36 pm	1.12057776e12	look at your pictures.	i see the multiplier is 12 and should read 18. as to the rest... do check your motherboard manual. i don't have a copy and you didn't give the link to it. bob

1967	5	112781	1286183	1281192	magicboy000	7/8/05 9:09 am	1.12081374e12	how can i change it?!!	i didn find anything to change the multiplier... all i did that i found a way to increase the frequancy of the processor from 133 to 200 and when i start now it gives me 200x12=2.4ghz instead of 133x12=16ghz so, anyway to make the (12) -&gt; (18)?? or that's it?!!
