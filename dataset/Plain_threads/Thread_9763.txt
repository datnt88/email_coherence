254	6	315104	2901166	2901161	r. proffitt	11/5/08 8:49 pm	1.22591814e12	just a link.	see how another solved it at
254	7	315104	2901841	2901166	re-tired	11/6/08 6:45 pm	1.2259971e12	tried steps in link	thanks for the lead. i had already uninstalled a previous burner (only files i found still around were log files). no new driver updates available. autofix still doesn't help. i'm becoming very concerned - nothing seems to help and i don't even want to consider new drives as i don't think two drives would mechanically fail at the same time. i'm trying to be hopeful that there's still something i can do to correct the problem. any other suggestions? - i'll try anything.
254	8	315104	2901838	2901841	r. proffitt	11/6/08 7:10 pm	1.2259986e12	so you've	1. tried one drive at a time. 2. removed the usual upper and lower filters (read  ) 3. booted safe mode and headed to the device manager to delete all cd/dvd drives there then rebooted. 4. noted if the bios sees the drives. remember if the bios doesn't find them, neither will windows.
254	9	315104	2902580	2901838	re-tired	11/7/08 8:52 pm	1.22609112e12	yes, i've tried 3 out of 4	i appreciate you sticking with me on this. i tried items 1, 3, & 4 with no success. i didn't attempt 2 because of the warning: &quot;uninstall all cd or dvd writing or recording programs&quot; before using this method. i have a writing program that was pre-installed on my computer with the os (program called click to dvd). if i delete it i don't know how to re-install as i don't have any install discs. at any rate, i see that this procedure is for resolving the error if the drive is missing from my computer, but shows in device manager with a conflict. this isn't my problem. the drives are shown in my computer and there is no conflict shown in device manager. am i running out of options?

254	11	315104	2902775	2902690	re-tired	11/8/08 9:00 am	1.2261348e12	filters last resort	bob, thanks for all your help. unfortunately for us novices, &quot;something that [doesn't] work well&quot; is more than an &quot;only loss.&quot; i guess it's because we often don't know how to correct something that's not working well (the difference between &quot;not working well&quot; and &quot;not working&quot; is blurred. i hope you know how much your work is appreciated on this forum. i've learned a lot in the process. thanks again. i'll report back on any success i get (it might be of value for others in the same boat.)
