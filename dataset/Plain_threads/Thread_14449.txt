(he is in college, and doesn't really have the time, or energy to trouble shoot, so i'm trying to help him out!) yesterday his drives crashed again, as he typed on it. well both drives were totally unreadable. no dir, both drives. both registered as &quot;unformated.&quot; i thought it was the seagate but now i'm not sure. if it was just the seagate, why would both drives, in raid 1, crash at the same time. very odd, and very frustrating. i bought him an external onetouch drive, for backup, reformatted, and reinstalled xp again. this time we are using the wd as the boot drive. i also disabled raid. i ordered a seagate hd replacement, but i'm not really sure if it is the hd at all, the mother board, the sata drivers, xp glich, or what. i know this is difficult question, but perhaps someone out there had a similar problem. any grey cell electrical energy you can throw my way will be appreciated! help! seagate barracuda 7200.8 250gb 3.5&quot; serial ata150 maxtor diamondmax 10 6b250s0 250gb 7200 rpm 16mb cache serial ata150 __________________ lanparty utnf4 ultra-d amd athlon 64 3700+ san diego 1ghz fsb antec neopower 480w power supply ocz 512mb 184-pin ddr sdram unbuffered ddr 400 bfg geforce 7800 gtx bios: 6-23-05 location: salisbury, md usa

(of course, this incident didn't save anyone money; i am a volunteer, so my time cost is zero.) if raid were as useless as you imply, why do almost all servers use some raid configuration? most new servers have hot-swappable drives so that in the event of a total disk crash, a new drive can be popped in, data copied to it, and the system back in operation in a very short time. i have raid 1 for important data on my main system at home. true, it may never save me any time -- mainly because i am in my eighties and quite possibly will not make it until a bad problem occurs. however, having it makes me feel a little more secure in case of an early failure or a late death, and i consider the roughly $150 i have invested in it to be well worth while. frank
