9843	7	30888	351531	351519	r. proffitt	7/27/04 7:48 am	1.09091448e12	yes.	it's a common issue, but many don't like that we have to scan and remove the pests with some 5 tools. some want a single piece of software to fix it. sorry, we don't have that technology yet (unless it's linux?) the short list is: adaware, spybot, cwshredder, housecall and bhodemon. bhodemon appeared a short while ago and i've found it usefull to list the bhos and to remove the ones i don't want. another issue is internet explorer. doxdesk explains it's danger. it's such an issue that i advise to use any other non-ie browser when possible. bob
