14833	12	221757	2349055	2349030	mrmacfixit	12/16/06 6:41 am	1.16625126e12	no conflict	but let's rule if out anyway. before we do that, let's try something, just for fits, grins and giggles. go to the system preferences pane and open the cd &dvd pane. in the section that says &quot;when i insert a blank cd&quot; choose &quot;ask me what to do&quot;. close the system prefs. reboot the mac with the firewire cable connected to both the mac and the lacie. one rebooted, insert a blank cd-r into the lacie. when the system asks you what you want to do, choose finder. did the system ask what you wanted to do? did the blank cd-r appear on the desktop? if the answer to both is no, move on to the next section. you may have a corrupt os, which can be fixed. disconnect the firewire cable from the mac. now the only things you have running will be the hardware that came with the mac. (built-in). reboot the mac. insert the toast cd after the mac is booted. it should mount on the desktop. double click the disk to open it. you should have a few icons that may, or may not, say &quot;drag to the applications folder&quot;. do so. did the finder give any indication that it was moving items from the cd to the applications folder? if it did, go to the applications folder and find the toast folder. open it. it should have the application inside it. double click it. what happened? i don't think that the toast app has an actual installation program, at least not on the cd, it is just a drag and drop into the applications folder installer. once you double click the actual program in the applications folder, toast sets a few things up, asks for a number and installs whatever extra comes with it. define &quot;weird things&quot; in regards to the pdf instructions p
14833	13	221757	2349258	2349055	mapmaker	12/16/06 11:50 am	1.1662698e12	toast 6 cd - no conflict	thanks. i've followed your directions except for the one which involves removing fw cable and then inserting toast. this is because my internal matshita cdrw would be the only way of inserting cd and it's simply unreliable - toast cd, like others, won't open in it (my reason for getting an external cdrw). blank cd's don't show on desktop using lacie cdrw. 'weird' pdf behaviour earlier involved 'broken' fonts/text, scattered around page, pages missing (which were there before) and freezing screen. i haven't yet seen the command which asks me for the toast key code and the sealed envelope toast came in hasn't got a 17 digit code, as roxio state it should be - it's p/n 210100un rev d v6.0.9. the disk has an 18 digit code underneath, around its centre. i bought this from usa ebay dealer who states it to be genuine, authentic, unused, sealed, etc. and will replace if necessary. the toast disk, when opened, contains a 'toaster' icon which does not open when double clicked - there's a short 'flash' of a small toaster icon but it does nothing else. other folders are 1) documentation (pdf instructions, etc), 2) upgrade to 7 titanium which crashes toast completely if attempts are made to open this and 3) make copies using popcorn. earlier, i dragged a copy of the disk to applications but this did no more than open a window showing the folders. it does not launch or give options. it's been suggested to me that toast 6 doesn't work with 10.3 and i should use 7. maybe 7 would work ok with the lacie ? is there a problem between the matshita cdrw and this cd ?
