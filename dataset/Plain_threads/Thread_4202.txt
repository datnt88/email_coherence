5145	6	1506	17855	17318	r. proffitt	11/1/03 6:32 am	1.06766832e12	a real puzzler. try smaller puzzle.	your on the right path. sometimes i drag the motherboard out onto a cardboard surface and add just the floppy, a little ram and see if it will boot consistently a dos diskette. after i reach that stage i install it in the case and make sure no extra metal mounting posts are shorting out the back side of the board. i build up from there. bob
5145	7	1506	18380	17855	minskin	11/1/03 4:07 pm	1.06770282e12	this puzzle can't get any smaller....	ok i'm back. it was late by the time i posted my last message (i'm in the uk) so didn't get your reply 'til today bob, thanks. anyway, i've dismantled the pc as you suggested and stripped it down to just memory, floppy and graphics and guess what? yep, it starts once and posts to tell me there's no keyboard (i'm sure it would have worked with the keyboard) but after shutdown it won't power on again, nothing, no fans, no beeps, nothing. i'm still using the power switch and speaker from the case and also the original memory module. could there be a problem with any of those? can't believe there could be anything wrong with the switch, there's not much to it is there? i'm aware that i could jumper the power pins on the board instead of using the switch but i'm always nervous of approaching the board when it's got power. i do recall the speaker sound becoming a bit strangled sounding when the alarm beeps were going off when this sorry story started with the cd drive blowing. i did of course try it again without the speaker connected, but it was the same old story....nothing. looks like i'll have to wait some hours now though to try it without the speaker connected or am i clutching at straws? frustratingly i have no spare pc133 mem modules to check the memory but would it start at all if there was a problem with it? i don't know what to try next, any more suggestions? thanks, as always, minskin
5145	8	1506	18466	16920	r. proffitt	11/1/03 5:16 pm	1.06770696e12	sooooo....	is it out of the case and on the cardboard? i read your post and it noted &quot;before windows&quot; which means you have too much hardware still to unplug since dos can boot from a floppy. think really small... bob
5145	9	1506	18523	18466	minskin	11/1/03 5:57 pm	1.06770942e12	re:sooooo....	yep, it's out of the case and on the cardboard. i only have memory, graphics and floppy on the board and the start switch and speaker connected. i'm not sure what you mean by your post, i didn't mention windows in my last post?? because i didn't have the keyboard connected i got a keyboard error and the cmos checksum error-defaults loaded error, but satisfied that it started i just shut it down to try and restart it again so i didn't get it to boot from the floppy, then, of course, it wouldn't restart. i have always been able to start it the first time from either a boot disk or normally into windows. either way i have never been able to restart it again until hourrrrrrrs later. confused........ minskin

5145	11	1506	19602	19313	r. proffitt	11/2/03 4:48 pm	1.06779168e12	make it smaller...	you are down to floppy, memory, cpu/hsf, motherboard and psu. you can now remove the floppy, memory as well. just want it to power up and beep. there should be all of four parts on the cardboard. the speaker has never been the cause of a power up issue so that leaves you with cpu, motherboard and power supply. if that won't power up and beep, then one to three of those parts are ... bum. bob
5145	12	1506	19688	19313	r. proffitt	11/2/03 6:40 pm	1.0677984e12	forgot about the battery.	newer boards don't power up if the cmos battery is low or missing. i wonder what voltage that battery is at? or how old it is. bob
5145	13	1506	19696	19313	willy	11/2/03 6:48 pm	1.06779888e12	re:re:re:sooooo....	you go a dozzie there. i suggest leave it as is, a minimized system. try using the cmos clearing pin(s) to return to defaults. reverify when the power returns and reset to the small system. allow to finish booting, if it can. if it doesn't and continues as it did, i believe the vrm is kaput, basically the mtrbd. got zapped. the vrm is a stable mtrbd. power cleaner and/or distrubes the power to mtrbd. componets, if you can pin-point the bad componet, it maybe a triac or diode that doesn't release when it should and puts a flase state until the power bleeds away from caps. that's a wag but if anything i believe its the mtrbd. at fault somewhere. you mentioned you swapped similar mtrbds. but you kept the componets like memory, etc. unfortunately the problem if 1/2 of one can resurface as still 1 or 2 componets going bad. you need a good test bed and test all componets until happy they're not it plus they work well alone with other good componets but the orginal componets if placed together again may again cause problems. its's a pita but that's the way it is. good luck -----willy

5145	16	1506	27078	19802	minskin	11/8/03 12:21 pm	1.06829406e12	it's the motherboard!!	hi everyone, i'm back from my short holiday and have tried a few things as suggested. the replacement cpu i was using throughout, works fine in another pc and restarts without problem, as does the floppy and psu in lots of combinations, all together and alone with other hardware. however, i managed to find and tried another cpu on the problem board and guess what? yep, it started once and then wouldn't restart. so, it looks like it is the motherboard after all. thanks so much to everyone that helped with this problem, you have all been very informative and if nothing else, i have learned a lot from you. thanks, minskin
5145	17	1506	27096	16920	r. proffitt	11/8/03 12:47 pm	1.06829562e12	thanks for the report back.	the power one circuit is on the mainboard. if you are an electronics wizard/maven, there is another way to power up if you are so inclined.  notes that the green wire to a black wire can be connected to a toggle switch to tell the psu to power up. i use at and now atx supplies for other than pc projects since they are cheap and plentiful. if it is just the power control circuit that has a defect and you are on some siberian outback, this could save you a trip across the tundra. bob
