(it came with his new computer. he couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.) i switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now i have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display. beautiful. should i tell my son? thanks again, ron
