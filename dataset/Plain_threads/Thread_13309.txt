3262	3	260044	2560944	2560911	r. proffitt	8/11/07 4:10 pm	1.1868486e12	is this a hp?	please don't ignore the words in red. &quot;asus p5lp-le motherboard (specific to hp) bios release date: 2006-05-01 bios version: 3.17 - 04/20/2006 (current bios if from the hp website)&quot; sorry, these boards don't support core 2 duo so there is no hope for quad core. bob

3262	5	260044	2561285	2560910	ozos	8/12/07 9:18 am	1.18691028e12	based on	what you've provided, and some information i found on hp's website, the mainboard has the intel 945 chipset, which is core 2 compatable in most all cases, and you said you have a core 2 duo currently installed (and working i would assume?) which leads me to believe it might support the quad core, however there are other variables you should consider before going for a quad core, like the power supply and case cooling.
3262	6	260044	2561455	2561285	rainv	8/12/07 3:41 pm	1.18693326e12	ok	yes i do have a core 2 duo running on it right now but i've only gotten two helpful replies and both are different answers(yes and no). can i run the quad core? i need a for-sure answer and if i cant can i get suggestions on what type of motherboard i should buy? (psu, cooling and such i can deal with myself)
3262	7	260044	2561456	2561455	rainv	8/12/07 3:45 pm	1.1869335e12	hm	just to clear up, lga775 and socket 775 are two differnt things, right?
3262	8	260044	2587420	2560944	soulwolf	9/18/07 1:19 pm	1.19012154e12	that's not quite correct	asus p5lp-le do support dual cores.
