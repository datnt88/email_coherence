1271	6	108233	1234415	1234228	dick white	6/9/05 8:15 pm	1.1183481e12	same.	as bob has indicated, it is not the length of time it is on, rather it is whether or not it is in a place with enough ventilation for the small amount of heat to be naturally dissipated. putting it underneath something else will prevent the warmth from escaping into the air.

1271	9	108233	1237000	1233429	wycanhow	6/11/05 2:09 am	1.11845574e12	i'm using d-link too	i had used di-714p+ (802.11b) for about a year and now have switched to di-724p+ (802.11g) for a month. i notice that di-724p+ generates more heat than di-714p+, probably because of its compact design. anyway they both work 24/7 reliably. how about yours?
