(i should mention at this point that both the desktop pc and pavilion had similarly slow speeds through the router.) i confirmed with my cable company that it wasn't a setting on their end that needed adjusting. then i called d-link. on the online configuration tool, they had me go under the setup tab, then to manual internet connection setup, then entering 4.2.2.2 in the primary dns server box and 4.2.2.3 in the secondary dns server box. (they tried to explain what this meant but i didn't catch it.) this caused me to lose my internet connection entirely. after a couple more calls to d-link in which they had me do little else besides cloning my pc's mac address a couple of times and unplugging/replugging my modem and router, i still had no internet connection. so they told me to return the router for a new one. then, just for the hell of it, i rebooted and got my internet connection back, although it is still slow. so what can i do? is it really defective, or is there something else to adjust? i have read where this router just doesn't work for some people, but i assumed that to mean it didn't work at all. any advice is great as i would prefer not to send this back if at all possible.

15052	6	285531	2715396	2715325	pudgyone	2/26/08 1:10 pm	1.2040314e12	could it be possible	that the firewall or the content filtering is slowing things down. i know he said he's all wired, do disabling the radio will help. rick

15052	8	285531	2715438	2715414	djr1904	2/26/08 1:31 pm	1.20403266e12	i won't take it badly	but there are so many settings in the online configuration and i'm new enough at this that i don't have a good sense of what's important and what isn't, or even what some of these settings do. so ask me what you need to know and i'll do my best to answer. i've tried to adjust various settings (too many to list) and nothing has caused any improvement. right now the router has all its default settings because late last night i reset it per instructions from d-link tech support. i have zone alarm on my desktop pc and comodo on my notebook and the internet speed through the router is the same on both. i have no indication (via error messages, popups, etc.) that the firewall is the issue. but i will check those settings and turn off the wi-fi tonight and see if that helps.
15052	9	285531	2715447	2715438	pudgyone	2/26/08 1:47 pm	1.20403362e12	here are simple settings	on wireless routers we usually update the firmware. some automatic updates don't work.  normally we broadcast ssid use wpa security use nothing else. do not use mac addresses. since you're not using the wireless part, then turn it off. check your firewall settings and turn them off. also turn off any of the filtering devices in the d-link router. setup should look like wall &gt; cable modem/router &gt; d-link router &gt; wired/wireless i don't know if there's some type of filter in the d-link that will limit usage. rick
15052	10	285531	2715817	2715447	djr1904	2/26/08 10:11 pm	1.20406386e12	update	i have tried everything you've suggested, individually and in various combinations. firmware is current. broadcasting in ssid. wpa security. turned off wi-fi. adjusted firewall settings. turned off firewall. turned on wi-fi but set it to a b/g signal instead of n. router setup is correct. made sure no d-link filters were on, as far as i could tell. and the results on my wired desktop pc were exactly the same: about 80% lower than normal. so unless anybody has anything else i should try, my question becomes: is there any way to know whether the dir-655 router simply won't work with my modem vs. just having a bad router that needs to be replaced and should work fine under normal circumstances?

15052	23	285531	3307193	3307181	thecolorcypher	5/19/10 10:07 am	1.27426362e12	wired vs wireless	i totally agree. that's why i upgraded the router for a gigabit wired connection. but, the wireless is essential for remote services like our phones, pods, laptops, guests that are not near the wall, etc. wireless is totally convenient, but i opt for wired as well whenever possible. all my desktops are wired, my tv is wired, my bd player is wired, etc. that alone makes streaming movies and music through our new samsung products and dlna products a dream, 8mbps or 12 and gigabit if local. clearly 12mbps would be better (especially during peak traffic hours).
15052	24	285531	3307209	3307193	r. proffitt	5/19/10 10:36 am	1.27426536e12	ahh, you may have tripped over something here.	i found that when an iphone or other things are in the brew, the shared airspace may pull back to 802.11b speeds. to fix this i move the router to 802.11g only mode and if i need a wifi link to a hdtv set i may even use a second dedicated wifi router as a wap. we discuss that in the top posts of this forum. new idea. set the router to 802.11g only. bob

15052	27	285531	5099165	2714911	puber_pmp	3/13/11 9:34 pm	1.30005204e12	same problem here	i have the same problem. i rma'd mine and the new one is exactly the same. speed test with old d-link router(di-604):  speed test with new d-link dir-655:  actually had a tech guy look at it and he can't explain it. he said the router is defective. i'm just going to send it back and go with something i can put dd-wrt on.
