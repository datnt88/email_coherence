(i have no idea why people do that) as i stated previously, this might not work out so well on a dell board, so use whatever config that works. really you'll never actually notice any performance differences with a optical drive on the primary channels unless you're trying to burn and do something else that transfers large amounts of data back and forth to the hard drive.
