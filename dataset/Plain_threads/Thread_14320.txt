''usb device not recognized. one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it. try again.....'' i tried the other port but nothing happened at all with that one. i uninstalled software, reinstalled and used the other port first, till wouldn't work. i can't install the scanner using hardware wizard cos the brand name isn't in the list (even when showing all names.) the scanner is a mustek 1200 ub plus. i have the system requirements it asks for, winxp etc. would someone be able to help me please?? thanks in advance, kiai xx

11116	2	117647	1335859	1335806	kiai	8/2/05 10:20 am	1.122978e12	oooopppssss!!	ok, cheers bob, now you're asking something. all this stuff about operating systems and the like....lol....don't know the make and model (doh!! don't know how to find out either) but my brother installed the os and yes all the drivers from it's maker are installed. (well all the ones i got with the computer.) i'm a beginner when with computers but i'm learning all the time (there's so much to learn though) i appreciate the time you took to answer. you were that quick you must have been sitting waiting for my question.....lol....... thanks again, kiai xx
