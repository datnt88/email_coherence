5054	9	48191	578471	578320	melati hitam	12/1/04 2:48 am	1.10186928e12	re: that's a clue.	the access point is separate unit from the router... both have dhcp functionality.. that is why i disabled the one in access point. cable modem -&gt; router --&gt; (ap + laptop + desktop) the router is configured as 'default' .. 192.168.1.1 and dhcp enabled. the point is that network is working fine with that setup .. and the new laptop is in default configuration ... i'm going to a friend house (different network layout) and try to see what happened there... back in about 6 hours .. till then .. thank you
5054	10	48191	578522	578471	r. proffitt	12/1/04 3:53 am	1.10187318e12	just asking.	why wasn't this revealed earlier? as it stands, it sounds as if you assigned some ip to the wired connection. if so, for instance 192.168.1.5 (for argument since you didn't tell) would be on the wired interface with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 with the ip assigned to the wired interface, the wireless (wifi) will never work since the route is &quot;occupied&quot;. i find it interesting you are doling out the needed information to find what's going on. that's your choice, but it may explain why support for your setup is problematic. bob
5054	11	48191	579170	578522	melati hitam	12/1/04 9:30 am	1.1018934e12	bob, problem solved	well, i didn't said anything about ip address etc. because i thought it doesn't matter, since the wired/wireless network is already work... and so i didn't thought of the network/lan problem... now the problem is solved... but don't ask what i do or how do i do it... because i didn't do anything... nothing is change. i tried at my friend house, it get connected as it supposed to be.. (turn on the laptop, and get connection.. nothing change) then just as soon as i get back home, i also get connected, and able to browse the internet normally... my guest is the wifi signal became very low, while i'm trying the laptop... anyway, thank you for all the help and information.
