(if sony tech support is hard to contact, you can download cpu-z from  if your mainboard chipset is i945 or i975 it *should* support a pentium-d.) 2) consider getting a 7900gs (about $180) or 7950gt (about $240) based video card. you may have to upgrade your power supply for another $50. 3) consider adding another 512mb to 1gb of ram if you have 2 free slots ($60-$120 or so). for about $400 you'd have a pc that won't be very far behind today's curve and should keep you happy till next christmas at least.
