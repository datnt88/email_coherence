2348	2	333705	2997240	2997225	si	3/7/09 9:08 pm	1.23646008e12	setup	thanks bob. i have setup the belkin router, as well as updated the firmware - it's been running like this for a year....every day i have to unplug it at least once to get my wireless signal back. so, i won't use it anymore for the wireless networking; i'll replace it with the rosewill. but i need to hardwire 4 of the 5 computers, and i want to put 3 printers on the network in such a way that i don't have to connect them directly to a computer, and have that computer &quot;on&quot; so that i can print from any other computer. i just thought that i might be able to do something with the belkin router to accomplish this, instead of buying a print server? every print server i've seen handles 1 printer - so i need one for each printer? then i need an ethernet switch because all my ports on the wireless router are already used up by computers? do you see how lost i am? lol

(it says &quot;identifying......mynetwork&quot; forever, and will not give me a network map, as it doesn't recognize the network as private, even though it is.) it's terribly difficult for me to explain because i'm not sure how to explain this properly. i had a linksys wireless b router before this, and never experienced this problem - matter of fact, i've never seen this problem on any wireless network i've configured for anyone! but, back to the question at hand: you think it would be best if i go ahead and get a print server. okay, any suggestions? every one i saw on the web is a single connection (for one printer?) - does that mean i need 3 of them? i had a read of sticky 17 - good info and i will utilize it!

2348	7	333705	2997343	2997353	pudgyone	3/8/09 6:59 am	1.23649554e12	on the laptop	the wireless card also has one of those settings. go to device manager(right click my computer, left click properties, left click hardware, left click device manager). click on network and then right click on your wireless adapter, left click properties, power management. uncheck the box, allow computer to turn off this device to save power. rick
2348	8	333705	2997365	2997351	r. proffitt	3/8/09 7:22 am	1.23649692e12	but in the next note we back off wpa2	there's a reason. it's because some routers don't like that. issues such as routers that run slowly or lockup are common. i had hoped that you would reveal your settings. then i could comment directly about them. in one sentence try all defaults, broadcast ssid, wpa and latest firmware. -&gt; about the printer server. i picked up a 26 dollar printer server with 2 ports. it's this one. but i have yet to run 2 printers and will not vouch for it. but i do own 2 of them as i am running a nas on one. here's the link to it and if they are out of stock, look at other sites.  there must be similar units for similar prices. bob
2348	9	333705	2997435	2997365	si	3/8/09 9:04 am	1.23650304e12	router & wireless	you know, thinking back, i had this router with the current configuration, using a winxp laptop with a netgear card. i never, ever had a problem with the connection. it only happened when i upgraded to a new laptop with vista home premium with an internal realtek g network adapter. hmmm..... well, thank you very much for the print server suggestion. i see it is oos, so i'll have a look around and see if i can find it any place else. but, for the dell 3100n laser, (which is network capable), can i just plug it into a router port (using sticky 17 setup)with an ethernet cable and assign it an ip address somehow? then i would only need 1 print server, i think? thanks!
2348	10	333705	2997437	2997343	si	3/8/09 9:06 am	1.23650316e12	i will try that...	...thank you!

2348	13	333705	2997472	2997446	si	3/8/09 9:38 am	1.23650508e12	one more question...	in the registry editor, i see 4 different {guid}s? i.e. in locating: hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{guid} i find 4 different {guid} lines - should i make the change to all 4? hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{0642efcb-8e53-40c6-82bb-3788a1190acd} hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{119f5d9f-849e-4f97-a960-89ff63afd6ee} hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{1419d93c-0050-46a7-ab08-331abaecf716} hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\tcpip\parameters\interfaces\{3a539854-6a70-11db-887c-806e6f6e6963} i'm guessing that 3 of them are probably the connections i set up trying to get this machine to connect to my network, and the 4th is probably my neighbor's, whom i assist with various computer issues on a regular basis and therefore connect to his network on occasion. so i should modify all 4 of them, correct? wow, would it be nice to have a proper connection!!!!! lol
