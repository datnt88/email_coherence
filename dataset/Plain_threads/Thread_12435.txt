(threshold exceeded condition) date of 2/15/2005, which indicates the new hd could fail anytime soon. hdd health uses s.m.a.r.t. to monitor hard drive soundness. in all three cases, it indicated a degradation in seek time performance and a combination of other errors, although my pc always booted and ran normally with no detectible glitches. i originally purchased the maxtor hd from an online company, but subsequently decided to deal directly with maxtor, when the second installed drive made the same loud clicking noises as the first one. a maxtor customer service rep i talked to asked me to put my telephone receiver right up to the pc tower, so that he could hear what kind of sounds i was complaining about. he confirmed that the sound was due to a defective hard drive and that i should return it to his company for replacement. well, the new hard drive they sent me is even noiser than the two others before it. when i called maxtor about the replacement drive, a different customer service rep told me the noise was normal and part of the hard drive's seek process. has anyone had the same experiences with noisy maxtor drives like i described? is this normal for all maxtor internal hds? i can't believe the noise is normal, because the original ibm h/d that came with my dell computer never made any noise at all. should i return the latest maxtor h/d for another one, which would make it the fourth one, or should i try a different brand like western digital?

3695	2	59017	700824	700728	harv	1/20/05 4:27 pm	1.10623842e12	is this just an acoustical problem or a sign of malfunction?	thanks for your reply to my dilemma, brent. however, i'm more concerned about whether the loud noises are an indication of malfunctioning hds rather than surpressing the noises. have you had any prior experience(s) with maxtor drives exhibiting loud clicking sounds? is it the nature of their hard drives?
3695	3	59017	700890	700824	brent welch	1/20/05 4:56 pm	1.10624016e12	re:	the maxtor drive in my 1st dell computer was whisper quiet. others maxtor drives that i've used since are louder, although i wouldn't really say they were overly so. using the maxtor program made them nearly silent. i currently have 4 maxtor drives from 1-3 years old, and no failures to date. i also have a wd drive that is louder than my maxtor drives. my opinion is that this is likely an acoustic problem. i've had no problems with maxtor reliability.

3695	7	59017	701212	701041	harv	1/20/05 7:17 pm	1.10624862e12	no, that isn't the cause, as	i used canned air to clean out the interior, when i installed the first hd. and, the geiger counter clicking sound is definitely not the fan. other than the loud clicks, my pc is working fine at the moment . but, i am very concerned that the hd will fail again soon, as indicated by hdd health's s.m.a.r.t. readings.
3695	8	59017	701241	700890	harv	1/20/05 7:32 pm	1.10624952e12	think the problem is more than just noise.	the situation is not very encouraging at all, as hdd health, the hard disk monitoring application on my pc, shows a bad reading (-2) for seek time performance including a -59 reading for an unknown attribute, resulting in a t.e.c. date of 2/16/2005, which means eminent hd failure sometime very soon.

(insert other brand here) is soo much better! my friend bought them and their computer still works! omg! i should have bought that one!&quot; hehe, as you can see, most people are really unhappy when their harddrive dies and they lose all their data. but the fact remains, harddrives die all the time, all brands die. how long will yours live do you ask? well that depends on alot of things, how much you use it, temperature, things like that. the old general &quot;law&quot; is every 10 degrees farienheit higher(than room temperature) and your life of components is halved. the general consensus at the time i worked at compusa was 3-6 years for a harddrive living(my experience by customer complaints). that sounds really short, but if you think about how long most people keep computers, are you really going to keep yours that long? i really doubt it. according to &quot;the law of accelerating returns&quot; we will continue to have better and better parts exponentially at cheaper and cheaper prices, so i doubt you will keep outdated equipment very long. and if the worst happens , you do backup your data right? oh you don't?...heh well good news, you can send your harddrive off to a data recovery service. it's expensive, but they can get data off the most dead of dead harddrives. so there can be hope if it is really worth it to you.

3695	35	59017	998444	998393	gsteele	2/25/05 6:42 pm	1.10935692e12	run a real diagnostic	i'd suggest running spinrite from gibson research. it will really get down and dirty with the drive, refresh all data and sector formatting, and look for cross-sector bit pattern interactions. by reading the log, you'll see how the drive is behaving, and whether there are bad sectors that were either recoverable, or that had to be mapped out. my experience with clicking in hard drives is that there are low-level (servo) problems that are causing the drive controller to re-seek because either the heads are out of alignment or the servo patterns are weak. after all, the user data, formatting data, low-level format, as well as the servo (location) data are all stored magnetically on the disk surface. hard drive disk surfaces can grow defects. they typically start off as point defects, and owing to galvanic interactions expand over time. if the defect is large enough, the drive's ecc won't be able to correct the data any longer - or the drive won't be able to find the sector, or ... you get the point. after running spinrite, if it still clicks - as in multiple seeks per read - that's incipient failure no matter how you slice it, and no drive price bargain compensates for the loss of important data, or for that matter, the loss of time spent futzing with the thing reformatting, reinstalling os, apps, data, yadda yadda. do you work for $2.00/hour? count how long you spend rebuilding a hard drive and you'll realize that a few dollars saved on a bogus hard drive are gone in a puff when it goes toes up. after spinrite ( if it still clicks, send it back. at least you'll have a spinrite log to prove to maxtor what's going on. hope this helps.

(nowhere in wd's literature mind you). he was nice enough to upgrade to two 200g's to 250's. now with 2 fans blowing across the drives and 1 for heat disbursment..finally..a month w/ o no crashes..no clattering.. ebm p.s. sent it backkkkkkkkkkk..hd clatter (fresh out of the box) is never a good sign.
