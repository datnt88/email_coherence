(not 100% sure i have not used your model). it should use only mac addresses. i would investigate the number of total mac addresses the powerline can have and what the timeout values are. the tricky part about these powerline devices is that they are designed to run more than just 2 units. i have little knowledge of how this actually works. unlike a real switch these devices seem to use the mac address of the powerline units themselves to direct other traffic.
