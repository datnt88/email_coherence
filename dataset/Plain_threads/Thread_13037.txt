11733	5	516390	5077810	5077790	r. proffitt	2/7/11 9:20 am	1.2970704e12	i'd consider	the usual 4gb intel i7 powered machine. even a dell might be found for that if you don't go with gamer video cards. too bad the machine you use today was not revealed. it could serve as a point of reference. such as it's 2gb versus 4gb. why it matters is that 4gb is not double 2gb. it's much more than that since the os ate a little (?) of that 2gb. i see folk going overboard on such things. bob
11733	6	516390	5077789	5077749	willy	2/7/11 9:20 am	1.2970704e12	lots of ram	your budget limits you imo. you maybe better to get the absolute best cpu you can afford with some ram. the ram you can add more later. your s/w must be capable of using whatever it has available so if the cpu being muliple core gets full usage under demand, etc.. the ram alone is highly desirable as it needs that to breathe sorta speak and flex its muscles. while the i5 class of cpu maybe costly compared to i3, you would be better served and the cpu cache should be at least 4m, better if possible. the i3 is more of entry level or offering on a budget. besides intel, amd offers good cpus too, but imho sticking with intel would be a better choice. check the intel support website and locate the specs of i3 and i5 and compare, amd too if you like. a work station is more of a workhorse rather than a home desktop and speed isn't usually the main factor, its what it can do for long periods and/or tasks. as robert pointed out, see what a workstation consists of and see if you build similar. i definitely would look for many ram slots and the mtrbd. chipset and in many cases video is build-in and shouldn't be a big factor in your final system. effectively you want raw power rather than speed. cooling should be a must too and darn good big case to house it all. help???  tada -----willy

11733	10	516390	5077809	5077806	r. proffitt	2/7/11 9:57 am	1.29707262e12	now i can compare a little.	my work, works well on laptops. over the past decade i've moved from compaq r3000 with amd 64 2ghz single core to hp amd dv6000 x2 turion to hp dv6 core2duo to what i use today which is a dell i15r 2646mrb with intel's i5 6gb ram and more. each has been a nice step up. i knew not to go to the i7 for a laptop so i wait for the next advance before i consider anything more powerful. the dell was only 749 and my only quibble is the lcd is barely acceptable but for the price it's quite a deal. -&gt; i have this computationally intensive app i wrote that sifts through some 4 billion number sets and it completes in 10 or so minutes. for me, this is fast enough. if the i7 is out of the budget, the i5 is quite nice. my core2duo took about twice as long. bob
11733	11	516390	5077821	5077806	r. proffitt	2/7/11 10:08 am	1.29707328e12	past a certain point, ram	the statement ram adds speed is disproved many times. mind you that those with scientific or math routines to run are the ones that can dish it out on that statement. on my dell i can unplug 2gb and my 4 billion sifting app completes in exactly the amount of time it did with 2gb more. for me this is proof the ram does not add speed. also, if hibernate my 4gb setup, hibernation completes many seconds sooner and it wakes up faster with less ram. wow, what goes here? less ram is faster? bob
11733	12	516390	5077860	5077817	willy	2/7/11 11:33 am	1.29707838e12	basic observations	a system will fall back on &quot;virtual memory&quot; using the hd as if ram. so, you may not see this as a factor or more so. i suggeted getting the best cpu now rather than later as that's a major cost of a new system. the ram usually is capable, say you get 4gb for starters, you can add later if the need arises. i'm sure that's more than your current old pc. i would also like to add the benefits of x86-64bit os, which leads me to think you're using a 32-bit version of os. the 64-bit version will better handle mutiple core cpus and/or make use of it, but the s/w should be ready for such, is it? if your s/w is 64-bit capable even though though 32-bit will run it may find a better world with 64-bit, however i don't get into s/w matters that much any more, other than reading the details of it. further as i already stated check with vendors what they offer in details/specs and you can upgrade abit when you build and get better system as that's open to you. tada -----willy
