741	6	280904	2689184	2689175	spartodd	1/26/08 6:25 am	1.2013287e12	interesting comment about the mp3's...	as i think i mentioned earlier on, i also have one of these devices at home. i'm able to stream mp3's and video over my wireless network at home without any problem (the drive being connected to my wireless router). if you're referring to streaming mp3's or other files remotely over the internet without having a full and paid mionet subscription i think that is another story. i will agree that the device has some very odd tendencies. one of those being the inability to access folders i created in the root directory via windows (so they are non cif shares)when i had mionet installed. i discovered i don't have much use for remote access, so i then uninstalled mionet but could no longer access those folders or the root directory itself. i had to reinstall mionet, drag those folders to the public directory, and then uninstall mionoet again. now, however, i can read those folders but can not delete them or their contents and still don't have access to the root directory. talk about a quirk. having learned some of the things i know now i wouldn't recommend it and would have looked to other alternatives, but again you can chalk this up to my learning curve on nas. appreciate the discussion, btw.
