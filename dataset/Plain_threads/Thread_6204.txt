407	14	556862	5278966	5278780	darrenforster99	2/25/12 5:53 am	1.33014918e12	there are a number of ways to do this...	there are a number of ways you can share files between two people, you can do it through a file server but this isn't always 100% necessary. first one is e-mailing back and to, as you are currently doing, this is the easiest way of sharing files, it doesn't require you to set anything up and you can just fling stuff back and to all the time at each other but of course you have the problem that every time your business partner wants that file he needs to call you up or e-mail you and ask you for it and then you send it him and that can get a bit of a nightmare. another way is to use a system like gotomypc, showmypc, logmein or any of the other similarly named applications.  these allow you to create a network connection between your pc and the other persons computer and then the other person can see your pc screen, and any drives you've shared with showmypc. this again is quite simple, most routers and firewalls are set up to allow these applications through and easily share documents. the only issue with showmypc is the fact that the other user can also see exactly what you've got on screen and control your computer, there are security checks in place which advise you when this is happening, such as a password and a notification to tell you that the person is looking at your pc (plus also the mouse can start to move on it's own!), but obviously you have to take this into account when using this and ensure that either you can fully trust the person at the other end or you ensure your monitoring what they are doing and protect or hide confidential documents and information you don't want them to see. then you can also set up your own ftp server. filezilla server will create an ftp server on any windows based pc (and linux has it's own version as well). using filezilla server turns your standard pc into an ftp server (it doesn't require anything like windows server or linux to run, just a standard windows system works fine). filezilla server works perfectly if both computers are on the same network (on the same router), however if you want to access it through the internet it then gets a little more complicated. to set up on an local network you just need to install filezilla server and then set the directory you want to use as the root and create users and what permissions you give to your users (for example read only, read/write, etc) and whether or not you allow anonymous logging in (normally on a ftp server with private documents on it you wouldn't). from then on any pc that retrieves it's ip address from the same dhcp server as the computer (dhcp server is normally on the router) can access that computers ftp server by typing into any windows explorer window ftp:// &lt;ip address or domain name of pc&gt; to find the ip address of the pc just click start and in the search box type cmd and press enter (on xp click run... and then type cmd). a black box will appear with all text in it, then just type ipconfig and press enter, a load of text will be on screen and it will amongst that will be ip addresses for your pc normally starting either 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x so if your pc has an ip address of 192.168.1.2 then just type ftp://192.168.1.2 and that will access that computer, you can also use the computer name for example if your computer was called maryceleste you could type ftp://maryceleste and then you will see the ftp site. this of course does all rely on you having the ftp set up on both the router and your pc right, if you find it will only work on the main pc and no others try disabling the firewall for a minute or two and seeing if that makes a difference, if it does then you know the firewall needs to be set up right. now as for accessing this method from a computer connected to the outside world - this can be a lot more tricky and is best if you really know what you are doing. firstly you need to set your computer up with a static ip address (if your router has dhcp reservation you can use this to reserve a specific ip address for your computer). then you need to forward anything going to the ftp port (normally 21) to your computers ip address (using port forwarding options on the router). then you need to find out what your routers ip address is for the internet, this is the wan ip not the lan ip and whether or not your isp gives you a static or dynamic ip address. if they give you a static ip that's good, as long as you have all your firewall software set up right and port forwarding set up you should be able to access your ftp site from anywhere in the world just by typing in your routers wan ip address. if it's dynamic you will need to use a service like dyndns to turn your dynamic ip address into a static one (or ask your isp for a static ip address). then using the ip address they provide you can access your ftp from anywhere in the world. another alternative to this is instead of messing around setting your router up and ip address up is to buy some webhosting and use the ftp connection supplied with that as an ftp drive, of course you need to make sure that the folder you create isn't visible to people using  there is also cloud based hosting, such as google documents, this doesn't need much setting up just a google account and then upload all your documents to it. you can then edit your documents through your web browser with google. some other methods that could be used are things like vnc (this shows the pc screen on the other persons computer, like showmypc, but it does need the router setting up the same way ftp server does.) you could use your own server, but again you would need to set that your router up to forward the ports to it, and the same for a nas drive. the simplest method if your not too technical is to use a service like showmypc or logmein, or use cloud based document hosting as all the set up is already done for you.

(luckily i bought them before harddrive prices got so outrageous!) i like the nas solution since it is simple and low impact - ie. small, draws little power and puts out little heat - this is a home network after all. this does not allow multiple people to work the same file at the same time - i don't think anything does that. however, maybe an even better solution for you is a really great program called ifolder (having nothing to do with ap*le). unfortunately it will require a server. heretofore i have only had the pleasure of using ifolder as a client when a company i worked for had it installed; but now i am trying to get this going for myself - unfortunately i am hardly versed in unix but as best i can tell ifolder is free!! but will only run on a suse server. so - i am going to try to see if i can install suse on a thin client and then ifolder (in keeping with my low impact requirements). this will allow me the simple remote access i want - but more importantly for me to effortlessly keep my desktop and laptop in sync. it may not be the perfect program - i'd prefer it did a few things differently - but it the best i've seen so far. in the best of all worlds i guess ifolder would work with linux - which runs most nas units and then someone would sell a nas with ifolder built in - that i would buy! if i ever get this working completely as i'd like - that thin client will run ifolder and an answering machine program. that would be great. another solution for you - if you don't mind keeping a pc on - is team viewer - that works well for me as too - if only it supported wake on lan - then it would be even more useful since that would remove the requirement of keeping a machine on 24/7 - remember - mine is a home network.

you mentioned that cost was a big issue. there are several services that offer free accounts for 2gb to as much as 25gb but if you are looking at sharing larger amounts of data, than you will have to pay. for example: dropbox offers a 2gb account for free, 50gb account for $9.99 per month and a 100gb account for $19.99 per month. online storage vs. syncronized storage - some services store your files in the cloud and you work on them remotely or download them as you need them. other services such as dropbox store your files in the cloud but also store a copy on your computer and then synchronize them whenever you make a change or add a file. the advantage of this is that you have access to all your files at all times even if you do not have an internet connection and if you make changes or additions, they will simply synchronize to the cloud and onto other users the next time your internet connection is restored. cost - there are some rather costly programs that tend to offer many more features such as additional storage, increased security and give you greater ability to control who sees what and who can edit or delete files. for example: dropbox offers &quot;dropbox for teams&quot; which starts at $795 per year for 5 users which caters more to business users. no internet - one big issue is whether or not you need to have access to files when you are away from an internet connection or at times when your internet connection happens to be down. compatibility - double check system compatibility with the operating system that you plan to use. some of the services require windows vista or windows 7 and do not work with windows xp or older operating systems. i ran into this problem myself when i wanted to use an old windows 2000 test machine. but i found that dropbox works fine on it too. some system may require that you upgrade all of your equipment before you can get them to work. in some cases this could cost you some big dollars. for example: icloud requires that you update your iphone and ipad to the latest ios and your mac must be running osx 10.7 (lion). if you are using it with a pc too, then you need to have windows vista or windows 7 and outlook 2007 or 2010. so if you are running windows xp with office 2003, you have some major updating to perform. file size - the general size of the files that you work on can greatly affect what kind of service might work best for you. if most of your data is made up of relatively small files (a few megabytes or less each) such as word documents and excel spread sheets than the type of service probably does not matter. but if you have the need to share large files such as video or huge raw image files than online storage may be too slow for you. it can take a long time to access and load some of these files due to the speed of the internet. in this case it would be best to have the files local to all machines and then synchronize them later. online vs. your own hardware - if you simply do not like the idea of someone else having your data, you can always opt for setting up you own file server. if you are handy or know someone who is, you could convert and old computer to a linux file server or simply purchase a nas (network attached storage) box. many of these nas devices offer methods to share files with others over the internet. i had good luck with some of the units from synology and not much luck with some from buffalo. note: keep in mind that having your own system will probably require that you have it on 24/7, you will need to consider some form of backup for it, and you still need to be concerned about security. also, in some cases, especially if you opt for a server of some kind, the power consumption alone could end up costing more than some of the online services. security -most file sharing systems use some form of data encryption but access to your files is still pretty much based on a username and password. i always recommend making this password difficult to guess by using at least 8 characters with a minimum of 1 uppercase letter and 1 number. never use common words that can be found in the dictionary for a password. i also highly recommend using additional password protection that word and excel offer when storing really sensitive files such as personnel files and or other files that may contain things like social security numbers, account numbers and passwords. i do this even for files that are not stored in the cloud. for example: i have a 3 page excel spreadsheet that contains all my account numbers, usernames and passwords for pretty much everything in my life. if this were to get into the wrong hands, it would be an absolute nightmare. it is stored on my computer as well as in dropbox so that i can access it from all my computers and devices as well as a backup is saved on carbonite. some people would say that it is crazy to store that on your computer, but i say, what is the point of having all this technology if you are not going to use it? if i am traveling and lose my wallet, i can go to any computer in the world and access dropbox to get all the phone numbers and account numbers so that i can call and cancel my cards. i don't know about you, but if i were to lose my cell phone, i am not sure if i could even remember my own home phone number anymore. again i can go to dropbox from anywhere and access my list of addresses and phone numbers. these files are important to me and having access to them is equally important. but i also want to store them as safely as possible. so one method is to password protect these individual files using additional password security built into word and excel. this way if someone happens to get your files in the cloud or from your lost or stolen laptop or even some form of virus then those important files have a second line of defense. if you are still really paranoid about security, you could always use a 3rd party encryption program like boxcryptor to encrypt your files before storing them in the cloud. online file sharing alternatives - here are just a few of the many online services that are available: dropbox --  box.net --  icloud --  google docs --  amazon cloud drive --  windows live mesh (skydrive) --  microsoft office 365 --  sugarsync --  spideroak --  if you want to read more about some of these services and compare features here are a few links you may find helpful.    dana wayland computer message was edited by lee koo (admin) to add links 03/02/2012 3:16pm

407	34	556862	5280260	5280195	ted de castro	2/28/12 3:16 pm	1.33044216e12	they go off every night ....	unless i'm running some long process - which is infrequent. the way i do things my data is backed up immediately after i generate it - to my nas .... which of course is always on. with progressive electric rates here - its too costly to leave a pc on - the nas uses far less power. pc also runs hotter - fire hazard. there are two modes of &quot;rough service&quot; for a computer - frequent on and off and on 24/7. do the math - even if you are a very heavy computer user you are only using 1/3 to 1/2 of its life if its always on (1/4 in a work environment - 5 out of 21 shifts per week). as a result i've had few if any machine failures - they run for years and years - well into obsolescence - which is usually the reason i upgrade or get a new one. this is how i've been using my pc's since 1980. mine go on when/if i need them - and off at the end of my day. it would be nice if team viewer would employ wake on lan - but at least it will wake the computer from sleep mode.

407	40	556862	5281576	5278757	webserf	3/2/12 5:59 pm	1.33071114e12	dropbox.	you can get a secured 2 gigs of storage. this is plenty of storage for documents, and typical office files, such as excel, photographs etc. also, files can be worked on and saved to the dropbox file, and collaborative efforts are possible however, if you mutually work on a file, you cannot work in a &quot;whiteboard&quot; fashion. so, it is best if one person works a file and saves it, before the person on the other end picks up and works on it.. also, it's a good idea to keep a back up copy of files in a separate folder, even if it's another dropbox. there are other cloud storage options, but i've found dropbox to be simple to use, and simple to implement. if you find it valuable for your business, you can also add storage and the price is reasonable..

407	62	556862	5281982	5281603	webserf	3/3/12 1:59 pm	1.33078314e12	i agree	there is no guarantee that the files will ever be safe once they are in the cloud, if that &quot;cloud&quot; is not controlled by the owner of the files. any cloud storage is subject to certain risks so it becomes a matter of what information is being pushed up there, and the potential liability. in most all cases the data is safe. an individual's information from an everyday business would probably not be of much interest to those who have the ability to hack into it. the level of protection that one might be looking for is directly related to the sensitivity of that data. that said, even banks and other keepers of personal information have had breaches. there are risks. make a decision as to what level your information needs protection and i'd wager that the more protected it needs to be, the more valuable your overall business is as well, therefore, you can manage to pay for the additional protection. i think a secure dropbox account is a reasonable choice for most businesses. as well the data that is pushed into the box can be password protected, and encrypted. at the risk of wash, rinse, repeat: determine the value of your information and seek out the level of storage and protection you need.

(not including email accounts). but i have had plenty of people lose documents stored on their computer because of a hard drive failure or by simply deleting them by mistake. i have many others lose or have stolen their entire laptop, ipad or smart phone and i have had numerous nas devices fail (especially buffalo drives) as well as plenty of external usb drives go bad if you take the time to create secure passwords (and change them often), setup multiple working backup systems, and implement additional encryption or password protection for sensitive data, then i really see no reason for concern. yes anyone of these companies could go belly up in the morning but so could your computer, that is what backups are for. dana wayland computer

(not including email accounts). &quot; i can tell you that, if you were using google docs, this would not be true. google employees are allowed to read your information that you put up there. dropbox is the same way. if you don't believe this, just read the tos, the privacy statements and the faqs of all of these services. google states that all documents are scanned electronically looking for inappropriate information. they also state that many of the documents are scanned by their employees. they also say they can give your data to 3rd parties (such as? maybe homeland security as twitter does? or their advertisers?). both google and dropbox have been hacked in the past with data being compromised. so, in general, while you may be correct that your data has never been compromised, if you used some of these services, your data technically has been compromised but you may not know it. it depends if you trust the host's employees or not. but what if your information is so sensitive, that nobody can see that data? not even google or dropbox? for example, my credit card numbers. or a lawyer's case notes on a trial. what if you have client's medical data (hipaa-related) and you put those up there and get caught? have a lot of money to pay a fine? is putting the data up there enough to cause a violation just in itself? these services do not guarantee hipaa-compliance (read faqs). not only do they not guarantee that you documents would be safe but they say that they have a right to read, modify and display your documents publicly! don't believe me. just do the reading.

407	82	556862	5282991	5282840	waytron	3/6/12 4:26 am	1.33100796e12	my point	i guess i did not explain my point very well. i deal primarily with private clients as well as small businesses of 10 or less employees as well as a whole lot of in-home businesses and there is a big difference between what should be and reality. for the most part, they do not have the it staff, personnel, funds or the know-how to implement security of any kind. i walk into small offices all the time that have zero security, no backup, expired antivirus and no encryption on their wireless network. they may also drop off unprotected computers and laptops to any old geek at any store for service. my point was that in many cases their data was probably more likely to lost or stolen in their own office or home then if it were with someone like dropbox. is this good? no! does it meet the requirements of any privacy law? no! is a service like dropbox or google perfectly safe? no! which again is why i recommend encrypting your own data before saving it anywhere. i agree, that even though services like dropbox claim to encrypt the data, they also hold the key. which is why i would recommend that if you have sensitive data, then you should encrypt your whole dropbox folder yourself. i am not disagreeing with you at all...

407	95	556862	5324383	5324300	waytron	6/18/12 3:15 am	1.3399893e12	free services	it always surprises me when people complain about not being able to talk to technical support when they are having problems with a product that is being supplied to them for free. what do you expect? just try talking to someone about problems with free accounts such as gmail, aol, yahoo or avg. does that mean that all of these services are no good? if you need or want phone technical support you have to belly up and pay for it. i have had no problem talking to technical support for clients that are paying for dropbox for teams.
407	96	556862	5324652	5324306	jtstcnet	6/18/12 4:17 pm	1.34003622e12	you guys are missing the point which is very frustrating	when you delete a file it asks do you really want to delete the file. this is not what i am talking about. the problem is counting on the files being there as you are a business and need to share files with different computers (different people sharing them or having them there when you go to another location). other users are finding: the files are deleting and therefore not available to them when they need them (and to avoid this they have to back them up on both locations often - daily, as soon as they get them, etc.). dropbox stops sharing - and the feature of dropbox (have two or more locations being able to see them) is not longer there. so you are back to emailing pictures to each other or having to wait till you get to other computer - e.g. dropbox is not functional. this does not happen all the time, took us 3-4 months of heavy useage before we ran into the problem. i am trying to warn people don't count on dropbox working, there are a lot of bugs. yes it is useful but don't count on it working. spend time backing up daily (or more often) so you have the files at both sides (vs counting on dropbox working). have a backup plan with dropbox stops working and don't expect dropbox to be able to resolve the issues at all let alone in a timely manner. i am bowing out of this conversation, the business users that want to count on dropbox understand fully what i am saying, as i said they can easily verify what i said by checking the dropbox forum. waytron - as i said, 3/4 looks like user caused (e.g. software setup on their computer like antivirus stops dropbox) 1/4 is dropbox bugs. and the lack of customer support is the same for paid accounts and non paid accounts, though they seem to come back quicker with the paid accounts (but still the problems don't get solved unless it is something simple like turn off your antivirus). we considered going up to paid version, but are taking another paid product instead because of the problems dropbox has. now, to make sure i don't get any more emails when people respond to this post.....

407	99	556862	5324728	5278780	hforman	6/18/12 10:50 pm	1.3400598e12	so, here are some of what i am seeing	especfially at work. at work (i work for the government), the people in my department were working with a local (but large) police department to implement a solution using one of these online public cloud services. that police department backed out at the last minute. why? because neither of the big providers are cjis-compatible. they wanted to keep criminal and case data on the public clouds so it is readily available to everyone. unfortunately, we have laws governing this in the u.s. the criminal justice information service dictates standards and, despite the use of a police office in one of their testimonial ads, neither of the big guys are legal for them to put this data on. let's also look at the medical industry. doctors, health maintenance organizations, etc. there are also laws that dictate what a doctor's office can and cannot do. this is commonly refered to as &quot;hipaa&quot; or &quot;hitech&quot;. please look these up. while they do say that medical records must be encrypted while at rest or in transit (over a network), they also specify who is not allowed to view this data. so, what it boils down to is this: let's take google but you will find that dropbox is about the same: if you are dealing with criminal data, cjis has a say in who can see that data. if you are dealing with medical records, hipaa dictates the same thing. both of the big services discussed here tell you straight up-front that they look at your stuff. that their employees look at your stuff. there are articles out there they say you may be subject to a hipaa fine if you put this kind of data on these services. at my office, a violation (not a breach) is suppossed to bring a fine of $1.5 million. google, only as an example, has stated that no public cloud is compatible with cjis. not true, take a look at datamaxx (2 x's). as far as hipaa is concerned, reportedly, google said that they are not subject to hipaa laws. that has not been determined, to my knowledge one way or another but certainly the medical offices that put data on these services are responsible. google (according to their faq's) assumes &quot;no responsibility&quot; for the user's hipaa certification. so, if we go back to the original question asked, should one put their business data on google or dropbox? the answer is that it depends. was the person part of a medical group? were they a government agency or a law firm concerned with confidential case data? were they one of the myriad firms that i buy things from and are they planning to keep my credit card data online? (just like hipaa and cjis, the credit card processors have to conform to a set of laws called the fact act). i don't believe that any of the general public services screen any of their employees especially with servers kept around the world. do they read your uploads? the big guys say that they do read them. it's in the terms and i'm not making this up. is this a violation? maybe? i don't know if it is but it should be. i'd not sure i trust my credit card, medical information nor criminal history to someone in a foreign country who makes a lower wage than someone making u.s. minimum wage? i'm not predjudice but look at the economics. on the question of losing your data. while i know that both google and dropbox have had hacking &quot;adventures&quot; that exposed data, i don't know if they ever lost data at least permenently. if they don't like your data, they say they can shut down your account, but i don't know if anything has ever gotten permanently lost. but maybe hardware and software issues could result in temporary loss of your data, even when you need it the most. like during a presentation. read their terms. they all say that they have no responsibility for anything.
