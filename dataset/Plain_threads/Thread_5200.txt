14298	2	296545	2784356	2784089	beatlemegafan	5/31/08 3:09 pm	1.21224654e12	by removing a drive	that gives more reason to improve other components, but with things like the air, you are trying to get a package that is too small for current technology. and with that, you still make a lot of compromises. sure 1.6 or 1.8ghz is pretty good for an ultraportable, but if you're using leopard, you may think otherwise. this concept won't advance for awhile, unless intel really does a good job with the new atom cpus. smaller processors will go a long way in ultraportables, no? -bmf
14298	3	296545	2784529	2784356	fbbbb	6/1/08 3:37 am	1.21229142e12	you're right.	the concept won't advance for a while and until then, i will need a drive. and it's not that 1.6 or 1.8 is too slow for leopard - it isn't, it's just that the air has poor cooling of its peripheral components which also affects the cpu's ability to cool itself. the shell itself doesn't get anywhere near as hot as the crudbooks / pros, but like almost everything apple i've encountered since '06, it is designers pushing the entire production process and not the engineers. the result is that when i stack up my 1.33ulv vista-based ssd notebooks against the air, the vista notebooks in many situations are faster (yes, even with glass on). and that's pathetic, since the air has none of the versatility of the ulv machines - no docking station, no ports, no crucial wireless connectivity even, and even what's built in - 802.11 / bluetooth - sucks in comparison to comparable portables. in case you're not clear, nothing in the air is too small for current technology. it may be too small for apple to accomplish without problems but that's a different - and typically apple - matter. although the air has been purpose-designed it is not an ultraportable in the vein of the sony tz or even the x300. it is more a macbook that has been stripped of everything in order to make it supposedly compete with the likes of the sony and lenovo. the air may fit into an envelope but in reality it pushes no envelopes apart from that of marketing. in terms of actual build quality - i.e. how it stands up to everyday use, not just fit & finish - it is somewhat worthless unlike the x300 or the tz for example. apple knows that a sexy skin will sell whatever crap they've put inside to the majority of the great unwashed who don't know better. the only reason i still have it, as i might have mentioned before is that i would like to run os x on something that i can actually carry. however it is a monumentally rubbish - and i will also admit monumentally pretty - lightweight notebook.
14298	4	296545	2784762	2784529	beatlemegafan	6/1/08 2:06 pm	1.21232916e12	the air is an ultraportable	in the sense that it is lightweight as you say. it's footprint isn't small, but you can carry it and stick in several places because of its &quot;thick/thinness&quot;. it is &quot;portable&quot; and more so because it is easier to carry; that's the bottom line. however, it isn't small . it's light, and that's why it will never be a true replacement for the old 12-inch powerbook. personally, i would go with the air just because i can use the os on it, but i still think i would get more out of the lenovo x300 with all of its connectivity options. it's running vista on a slower processor, it's not as &quot;shiny&quot;, nor is it as thin. but we all know that thinkpad will get the job done. i think that the air concept is a good one, but its designated target is somewhat slim in comparison to other portables. honestly, for less money, i'd go with a much more powerful macbook. the only sacrifices there are the cosmetic features and the weight, but really, you're only giving up the ambient light sensor and aluminum enclosure. the air is pretty sweet. just picking one up and using at the store for a few minutes tells you that. i like how it looks, but that's not why i try it out. the trackpad and its weight are far more interesting. i watch the screen, and that's about it. apple knows what it's doing with the air, but until they can get it up to speed, put in more storage and offer removable upgrades (ram, batteries), there's no point. version 2 should be much better. if apple can bring the air up to specs and performance comparable to the standard macbook, then it's just a matter of how much portability you want and how much you want to spend on it. on a side note, i just got an airport extreme card for me old imac g4, and i was more interested in looking at the new imacs at the store than the air. installing the card in the base of the computer was easy; connecting to the network, not so much. the area between the user-accessible ram slot and airport slot in the base is made of plastic or something like it, so i tried to be careful, but i didn't plug the antenna cable in the card all the way. big mistake. course i opened it back up and got it running now. gotta love this lampshade. what bothers me is that the software install disk for other airport utilities installs the now dysfunctional internet connect app (which works in tiger, but not in leopard) and some other airport utilities that i will never need. apple should make those disks more current... whatever, i just threw the three apps in a folder in my utilities section. i got this thing working now and i don't feel like deleting anything in case it something happens. too bad it is only wifi b/g. but it is plenty fast now. i would much rather get another mbp over the air. 1-inch thick is still amazing to me, and 2.5ghz is whopping fast in a portable computer these days... i need my existing one to be looked at anyway. both the keyboard and aluminum exterior aren't quite perfect (minor case separation and crooked keys...). but it's solid and is what i expected out of a mac, save those cosmetic problems. the air is all looks and weight i think. again, it won't be worth it till version 2 or 3, like the iphone. i see the 3g iphone becoming a big seller. only a few more days till wwdc and then we'll see. -bmf
14298	5	296545	2784828	2784762	fbbbb	6/1/08 3:32 pm	1.21233432e12	the other notebooks	are no less compromised, but obviously in different ways. i have several macbook pros in both 15&quot; and 17&quot; sizes - in fact several macbook pros for every generation there has been of them - which have similar but not identical heat issues, and there's the problem of durability and build quality. i really am not used to my supposedly premium notebooks warping for example, and there are several other problems that they still seem not to have addressed fully with even the current incarnations. i also have other premium mainstream-sized notebooks from other manufacturers once again kept current through the generations and there are very good reasons that i call the apples crudbook pros. for me, looking good isn't enough - it has to work right as well. i've also recently bought my first macbook since a disastrous encounter with them back in '06. better certainly, although with the litany of failures/defects the 06 macbooks had i would not be surprised. however an xps m1330 is still so much better in various aspects.
14298	6	296545	2784964	2784828	beatlemegafan	6/1/08 8:31 pm	1.21235226e12	that's why the macbook pro is an ideal computer	for me anyways... sure it looks good, but it goes way beyond that. the os looks good too of course, but again, not my point. my mbp has performed to and exceeded many of my expectations over the period of time that i have been fortunate enough to use one. i must say, i could care less about heat issues (i use it on a laptop stand to deal with that), the graphics and other hardware are superb, and overall it's been great for me. now i can't say the same for everyone, but for the most part, apple's got a good thing going. my only quarrel with apple has been over build quality (ex: airport problems, case &quot;warping&quot;, etc.) and afterwards, apple just replaced the thing with a newer one. that one now sits on me desk, and with its newer, though somewhat dated today, santa rosa technology, it's much faster than its predecessor. the only &quot;problem&quot; with this model is the build quality, and really, it's not even very bad on this particular machine, so i'm grateful for that. but macs are supposed to be &quot;premium&quot; machines, and i have applecare, so i expect this issue to be eradicated all together. the keyboard keys should be looked at too, but the main issues lie in the screen bezel, the aluminum above the magsafe charger port, and the area above the dvd drive. that's where it is separating, and it would seem that it only gets worse over time, just like my previous mbp. now that i have my imac all fixed up and running, i actually have a reliable mac to turn to while the other is in for repairs. now that i think about it, it would be a quick repair anyway, since this time around all of the internal components are working perfectly (or so it would seem, lol). all they would need to do is put in a non-crooked keyboard, and replace the aluminum shells around that, the screen, and on the back of the screen to fix the issue. still, i think the macbook pro is one of the best notebooks out there. cosmetic issues don't always affect the computer itself, and it works great as a computer, so i think that's where it scores big. -bmf
