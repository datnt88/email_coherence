7455	2	569400	5342923	5342903	ravenbleed	8/3/12 8:59 am	1.34398434e12	system restore	now that is crazy. i haven't had to do restore for a very long time. went to system restore and to click on a restore date. there are no dates showing. the &quot;calendar&quot; is blank. as for the drivers i only checked to see if they were all up to date and they were. what would cause this issue with system restore? going to check the bios settings now.

7455	8	569400	5342968	5342931	ravenbleed	8/3/12 12:59 pm	1.34399874e12	sr	i tried what you suggested and that still didn't fix the issue. so i ran disk cleanup and sr now show the calendar but now it won't allow me to chose a date. my only option is restore today. i went into device manager and there is a yellow question mark beside multimedia audio controller. i did right click on it, disabled and enabled and check properties. it appears their is no audio controller or driver...i'm not sure which of those is the issue and how to fix it. thanks

7455	11	569400	5343222	5343152	ravenbleed	8/4/12 6:53 am	1.34406318e12	driver	i right clicked on multimedia audio controller and properities. it states there is no driver. i searched around and the driver they are suggesting is realtek 97 and it keeps crashing my pc midway through the install causing the blue screen of death. after i two attempts at installing it i gave it. i also went in services, windows audio and clicked on restart and nothing. still no audio. i shut down and rebooted and still no sound. i just keeps stating there is no driver for multimedia audio controller. i downloaded the suggested one from here but for some reason it won't allow me to run it. any suggestions.
7455	12	569400	5343265	5343222	r. proffitt	8/4/12 9:35 am	1.3440729e12	there are dozens of realtek audio chipsets.	and dozens of drivers for each one. so it is almost a sure thing you can't get the right one. ----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i can't find the model number of this dell. then means i have to go with generic advice along with the usual head to dell.com, put in the service tag from the machine for the drivers. bob
