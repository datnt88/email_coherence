10705	6	380998	3236818	3236604	camaren	2/1/10 5:22 am	1.26500172e12	i tried.	i looked up how to do the factory reset. it said to turn off monitor, unplug power, plug power back in while holding down the last button on the left, then push the power button to turn on and off three times, holding on the 3rd try til it comes on--hold for 10 seconds and release. i tried this with all the buttons when it didn't work the first time. is this the correct way to do a factory reset? if it is, then you are right, it's dead and i'll throw it away but i was hoping someone could revive it!
