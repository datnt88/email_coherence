14869	5	277815	2667203	2667135	ramarc	1/1/08 11:51 am	1.19918826e12	if the channels are on a digital tier, no	the digital tier is not 'free'. so you won't be able to record hd programs that require you to have a digital cable box.

(just be sure to grab either a 32-bit copy, or a usb-based tv card, as 64-bit oses almost never work with internal tv tuner cards.) -good luck launchpad_72 aka iamthedonut
