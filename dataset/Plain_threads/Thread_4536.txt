6528	4	252763	2519415	2517042	ramarc	6/20/07 3:15 pm	1.1823525e12	looks fine except for video	you're looking at a $105 geforce 7600gt and a $285 8800gts. why? if the 8800gts fits in your budget, get it because there's no other $300 card that can match its peformance. if you only have $200, get a radeon x1900xt. if only $160, its a tough call between a geforce 8600gts (dx10), geforce 7900gs (faster), or radeon x1950pro (fastest). don't put anything slower (like a 7600gt) in a new gaming rig.

6528	6	252763	2520107	2519677	ramarc	6/21/07 8:25 am	1.1824143e12	buy the card you want from newegg.com or zipzoomfly.com	gateway offers a limited number of graphics upgrades but any of the cards i mentioned will work in the pc. gateway's price on the 8800gts is reasonable especially since they will pre-install it for you. the x1900 crossfire won't match the all-around performance of the 8800gts. as i said before, if you don't have the budget for the 8800gts, get what you can afford from the earlier list.
