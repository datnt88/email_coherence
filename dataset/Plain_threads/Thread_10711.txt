203	2	213732	2285644	2285120	nubot	10/21/06 1:23 pm	1.16143698e12	hope this helps you more to understand my problem.	more infomation: i had one drive, my original drive(sata 1), bought second drive(sata 2)used on asus p5ld2 mother board. can a sata 1 drive work with a sata 2 drive? both show up as bootable but the sata 2 drive, is the primary. i want to be able to log into old drive to copy files or use seperately. i can format it as storage drive- but lose all info- i want to copy it's files first. was thinking maybe i can use windows disk to repair the partion (or fix windows) maybe that might allow it to show in -my computer -in windows and allow me to use it. the sata 1 drive shows up on everything- but my computer in windows- and in disk management there is no drive letter. in sata config. on the board, i have the 320g(sata2)as the primary drive- plug 1 (the red one) and the original drive the sata 1 drive is on the slave sata plug 3 (the black one)- this is designation on the asus motherboard sata plug 1+2 master and sata plug 3+4 slave. hope this will help you more. thanks.

203	4	213732	2286227	2285674	nubot	10/21/06 8:59 pm	1.16146434e12	lucky?	thanks to the person who has taken effort to reply- thanks bob. it maybe hard to understand, but i did what i was trying to do- and learned more about drives. sata controllers work independantly- i was pretty sure. there was no reason why my old formatted drive should not show up. but only my new drive that had been formatted showed. i just fooled with the windows cd and loaded some of the drivers from the cd. and low and behold this drive is now reconized in my computer. i put both on the sata master inputs(the red ones)- i did this before so i think the drivers on the windows cd helped the windows install reconize the drive. the bios has always reconised it (drive that wasnt seen in windows). now if i could just find a good program or find a way to transfer files- but now that i think. datalifeguard will probly work. thanks, bye.

203	8	213732	2287324	2287056	nubot	10/22/06 2:58 pm	1.16152908e12	it worked!	thanks alot man- you the man. you really help me. cant figure out how i got the drive to be reconized. my first motherboard (before this new one that i used old drive in)stopped working. and i found two viruses on old drive, but only after it was reconized. do you think the windows cd had something to do with it, when i reinstalled the drivers( but it was already showing in bios, and disk manager- just not in my computer?, and no hardware issues in device manager? any way this is what i knew could happen with these drives, and we worked it out. so thanks again for the info bob- the last bit totally helped. i'ld like to know what you think allowed the drive to be reconized, or was it a quirky thing. thanks
203	9	213732	2287330	2287324	nubot	10/22/06 3:15 pm	1.1615301e12	one more thing	sorry forgot to ask this, will try it. but i should have no problems no doing a simply drag and drop from one drive to the next to transfer files- this could however spead a virus right.
