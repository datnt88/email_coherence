3237	2	65927	784017	783711	unknown	2/22/05 8:10 pm	1.109103e12	this went south all of a sudden	i used it to make a few music cd and to back up my system monthly. a replacement isn't expensive but i want to make sure it is a hardware problem before i replace it.

3237	4	65927	992577	784028	unknown	2/24/05 7:57 am	1.10923182e12	cd drive	please explain what a knoppix cd is and what k3b is. when using nero to try to do a copy disk nero still doesn't see the burner and creates an image on my hard drive.
3237	5	65927	992631	992577	r. proffitt	2/24/05 8:18 am	1.10923308e12	i don't explain such. here's why.	-&gt;  finds knoppix and pages about knoppix in no time at all. plus said pages will tell you about knoppix in many ways. i can't guess which method works for you and as such will not write much about knoppix except to share it's how i test a cdrw before i replace the drive. k3b is the cd recording software included in the knoppix cd and ... very easy to use. again, with all the documention on k3b plus it's help pages, i see no need to repeat that content except to share it's the tool i use. hope this helps, if you didn't write that your nero is something bundled with another drive then you are trying to use if with a newer cdrw, then that's your loss. that results in the scenario you have presented. just so you can burn cdr/w media the nice software from  is free and may help you get by until you fix your issue. bob
