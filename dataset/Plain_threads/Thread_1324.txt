9143	7	275195	2699282	2655706	rob54w	2/7/08 7:13 pm	1.20241158e12	not slimline form factor	you have a choice for the &quot;slimline&quot; form factor, but it isn't neccesary. there are normal sized choices for both. i prefer the 530 because of intel. intel-based pc's have a reputation for lasting longer and running cooler. go with the 530. that's what i'm doing.
