13068	7	186165	2026096	2025643	pksteven	6/24/06 9:29 am	1.15114134e12	you say...	it runs better with one stick than two. have you tried each individual stick to make sure one isn't bad? no, just because it's new doesn't mean it's good. are you sure you handled them with care, or that you were properly grounded when you installed the ram, or touched other components? did you make sure the ram slots are clean of dirt and dust and the ram connectors are clean as well? are you sure it isn't the graphics card? you said it was running sluggish before. while 512 isn't top end, i have't seen too many computers run that sluggish on 512 unless it had other issues.are you sure your cpu fan\heat sink are clear of dust and dirt as well? i may not have caught what power supply you have, what wattage is it? paul

13068	11	186165	2026635	2026476	yelnlifda	6/24/06 2:49 pm	1.15116054e12	good ideas	thanks for the tip about memtest. i've run the ram in single channel mode and i get less errors, still not error free unfortunately. the reason i suspect the power supply is that i recently (within the last 6 months) added a few power draining components. a 256mb video card (which specifies needing a psu of at least 300) and a 300gb hard drive. i was unaware of the strenght of the power supply and adding 4x's the ram may have been enough to drain all the power. is that a fair assumption? thanks for your help!
