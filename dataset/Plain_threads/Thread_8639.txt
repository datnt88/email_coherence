7470	7	257568	2547073	2547063	shahrokhan	7/24/07 2:24 am	1.18524384e12	success	yay by using getdataback, i recovered most of my files onto my laptop even though they gave lots of bad sector errors. i had alerady recovered my windows partition so i booted into it and continued, my hope lost for the complete recovery of my data partition. i tried testdisk once again. and ta-da it got recovered! i think testdisk is the best application out there for data recovery because it is powerful, small and fast. thank you for your help! btw i dont think i would be able to get that kind of hdd for under 99bucks over here. i dont live in the usa where the demand and competition is high.
