518	4	248218	2490138	2490109	marbleann	5/18/07 9:24 am	1.17948024e12	sorry	sorry but i thought i mentioned that because the keyboard that didn't work with my new sony dvd player worked with my older sony cd player and they both specified the same keyboard. i was confused about that. it was a important point. a pre senior moment on my part.
518	5	248218	2490147	2490138	r. proffitt	5/18/07 9:50 am	1.1794818e12	so it's a sony dvd thing. no part number?	it's one of those little bits of information that could have someone write they have it and use some specific keyboard. bob
