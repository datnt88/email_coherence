[the 64 bit versions do have a heat spreader, they have copied most of the good heat protection things that intel has had for a few years.] artic siler and a few others are also electrically conductive so be careful to not get it on anything but the heat spreadr. the thermal compound goes on in a very thin layer. too thick and it tends to npot transfer heat as well.

[extremely important for the amd's, but also for the intels., especially when using thermal paste that is also electrically conductive.] study the assembly of the two and you will see that the cpu is not in the center of the heatsink due to the fact that the heatsink also covers the part of the cpu socket that has nothing on it. this is to allow the clamping system that they use to apply a uniform force across the surface. the amd's have four spacers to prevent crushing the small cpu. the intel heat spreader gives a larger surface. in fact there have been cases where the hsf was put on backwards on amd cpu,s and only touched part of the cpu and the cpu overtemped fast. with the intel's the heat spreader makes this less of a problem.
4349	5	35012	405098	404453	ray harinec	8/30/04 2:51 pm	1.09387746e12	i calculate that to be 46 c.	which isn't bad if it is the valid cpu temp at maximum stress on the cpu. gamers try to do better, usually at the expense of larger heat sinks and much noisier fans [very high rpm]. they often claim 35 c. btw the cpu will enjoy long life at 46c [may outlast you lol] the best thing that i have found [not in any way a gamer] is a top exhaust fan and a side fan that blows room ambient air directly towards the cpu/hsf
