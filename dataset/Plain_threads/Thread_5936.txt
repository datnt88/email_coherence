(windows was freezing) it notified that it found and fixed all errors successfully. my question is, how long could this fix work for? what are people's success rates with this when all bad sectors are fixed? because my understanding is that bad sectors could spread causing even more drive failure. alternatively could a bad shutdown or power outage cause bad sectors, therefor causing the drive to still be good in all other areas? in which case a chkdsk /r would be a permanent fix.
