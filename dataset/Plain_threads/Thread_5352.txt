(another interesting thing is why it doesn't show op on their website) 2) how can you you install windows 7 without an optical drive? i have read some of the articles on how to do this but i have been unsuccessful. i know you must format the usb drive a special way using the command prompt but i am not sure about the rest. thanks, brian
