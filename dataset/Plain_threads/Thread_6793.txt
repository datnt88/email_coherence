(obviously it would be better to go in between, i wanna know out of personal interest. so those are you only two choices ;))

5753	7	228003	2385720	2384124	vewert	1/26/07 5:12 am	1.16978832e12	depends i guess	my comp. as of now has 2 gigs of ram and a 128mb ati standard video card that came with the desktop. i'm thinking about upgrading the video card now but i have no problems running games like counterstrike or battlefield on it. but with vista now out, 256mb video memory is the standard it seems.
5753	8	228003	2386045	2372302	ackmondual	1/26/07 10:26 am	1.16980716e12	imo, they're both equally bad	having borderline amt of ram to run the os won't get any decent performance, or even ability to run games. having somewhat higher than the min will allow u to play lower-end/older pc games better, but which probably won't end up using the might of the muscular vid card since those games aren't likely to have great textures, graphics, lighting/shading, and other visual effects having a crappy vid card but lots of ram, again probably limited to flash games and lower-end/older pc games. ditto if the vid card were slightly above low-end. u'd actually be able to play higher end games decentl, but with features and details turned off/down. if it came down to these 2, i would go latter for work, as generous ram is certainly a performance/productivity booster. for home, the former, as i would just upgrade ram right away, which is the easier of the 2 to upgrade.

5753	11	228003	2386632	2372302	abobddy	1/27/07 12:33 am	1.16985798e12	well if you want the best experience	both! you can't really choose between ram and a good gfx card for excellent gaming experience. both of those two work together to deliver great graphics. for example, i have 1gig of ram and i used to have a geforce 6600 128mb. playing the sims 2 was sweet, even with the expansions installed. there was very little lag, and i spent hours in front of the computer. when i would play counter-strike: source, it looked great. i even used that hdr (i think, you know that stuff where it was featured in half-life: lost coast) and it was playable with no lag. so you really can't choose. :p
