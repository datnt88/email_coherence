12851	6	88441	993665	993615	ray harinec	2/24/05 4:49 pm	1.10926374e12	are you certain that the hsf is clamped	securely to the cpu??? i have just run into two cases where one of the platic clips broke and reduced the tension between the hsf and cpu [yes actually it is compression, the tension is in the clips. lol]. wht type mobo?? is it a micro atx??? they have a great dea;l at newegg every few days for an aspire case with 350 watt supply $58 and free shipping. if installing mobo into a new case, we can provide that info. for putting in an existing case, we can also help. just some differences to discuss. if your cpu is getting too hot, i'm not keen on blaming it on the mobo. was thermal compound put between the hsf base and the cpu surface??? any chance that the hsf is on 180 degrees out?? the cpu is not centered on the hsf, there is only one correct orientation for the hsf.

12851	8	88441	993799	993665	nlove99	2/24/05 5:40 pm	1.1092668e12	thanx for the feedback...	the hsf is definitely clamped securely to the cpu, and the mobo is a micro atx, but like you suggested, it might not be the mobo and i should try out other things 1st i'm not sure what thermal compound is but there was a sticky-ish white residue both on the hsf base and cpu surface... what does that mean? i'm sure that the orientation of both the cpu and hsf is fine, since there is only one way they can fit. that blowhole idea looked interesting... scary but interesting!

12851	10	88441	998177	993799	ray harinec	2/25/05 3:46 pm	1.10934636e12	the white sticky stuff is the thermal compound.	really shouldn't be oozing out but??? thethermakl paste coating should be very thin. too big a glob can cause to impede heat transfer rather than help it. maybe get another hsf with a larger hs and faster fan [more noise lol][make sure it will fit. it just seems that possibly the fan might not be running fast enough. the micro atx case is rather small so i can see why cooling can be a problem. the fact that case open and external fan didn't keep it cool enough, does sound unusual. don't have too powerful a fan [your house fan] blow directly at the cpu's hsf because it could actually slow the hsf down. have it blow on the video card and memory sticks. there are other reasons for a system shutting down. one is the bulging or leaking capacitors.

12851	14	88441	1021819	1005121	platinumppc	3/6/05 8:17 pm	1.11014022e12	power supply	the first thing i'd check is the air temp that your power supply is pumping out. the power supply is probably, depending on the config, the biggest producer of ambient air temp increase inside your case. most people fail to realize that an extremely dirty power supply willl produce far more heat than a clean one, and if it's a single fan unit, the cooling effect of the fan maybe insufficient. if you have more than just the power supply venting air to the outside, check the temp of the air the other fans are expelling. the power supply should be the only expelling fan with a temp markedly warmer than room temp. being a bit of a cooling freak (i have sixteen rotating fans and a water block cooler in my thermaltake xaser ii) my suggestion to anyone is to start with a reputable dual fan psu.
