7445	4	508275	5039052	5036481	noblepuker	12/3/10 9:08 pm	1.29141048e12	confused about your monitor	does this tv have a monitor,or hdmi connector on it? if so,you'll dig it...otherwise it's a fuzzy waste. also,is your 9500gt built in the motherboard,or did you add it later? look on the back of it...it probably has an s-video plug.(hey guys,they have hdmi outputs on video cards yet?). analog will drive you insane,and s-video will make ya beat your dog.(maybe your 9500 has hdmi output,it resembles a usb slot) the fuzzy picture you get on your tv will dissapoint unless you run a lcd,plasma,or theater projector.they look as good as any pc monitor. the number of pins in the connector used dictates how good the tv picture will look: 1)monitor:12 pins (lose job & girlfriend) 2)hdmi vs 12 pin? (similar to 12 pin) 2)compsite:6 pins (never seen these) 3)s-video: 4 pins (begin to hate pcs) 4)analog: 2 pins (housecleaning is more fun) second: your video card can throw super hi-def in widescreen(16:9),or standard (4:3)...it's in the cards settings,and has nothing to do with whatever screen used. note:monitors support limited resolutions,but far more than 640x480....unless your tv/monitor is ancient.

7445	6	508275	5043254	5039052	theant317	12/9/10 9:10 pm	1.291929e12	i guess it's a little late to ask	maybe my best bet would've been to wait until i get a new computer and an hdtv before i ask again. my computer/tv are fairly old. the computer is a 2006 model and the tv i'm not even sure of. i basically bought it used at a yard sale. it might be a 2004/2005 model but i'm not sure.
