9833	3	111374	1265586	1265560	mrtoughpants	6/26/05 4:59 pm	1.11980514e12	reply	yea i assembled everything at once :/ power led is the one on the motherboard i have speakers/sound blasters the 'speaker' 4-pin front panel connector is just not there i can't explain it, the case didn't even come with a manual... i'm going to try what you said. atleast i don't have to swap the hdd and drives to do that would be a pain.

9833	8	111374	1265618	1265590	ray harinec	6/26/05 5:22 pm	1.11980652e12	as i said, all of the cases that i have	bought in the last year or so come with that little black barrel thing to use as a speaker. very confusing for a few reasons. some bioses do not give the single beep when everything is ok, some mobos have the speaker on pins 1 and 3 others use 1 and 4, and the mobo manual does not normally tell whether one will get a single beep for a good boot, so between that and the crappy little device it got frustrating.
9833	9	111374	1265619	1265607	mrtoughpants	6/26/05 5:25 pm	1.1198067e12	tried booting like you said.	and it didn't work the same thing happened. the led light on the mobo turned on then i pressed the front power button and the cpu fan turned and stopped. samething as usual.
9833	10	111374	1265624	1265586	ray harinec	6/26/05 5:30 pm	1.119807e12	yeah, the soundblaster speakers are no help here	if you have any old permanent magnet type speaker laying around you could jury rig that. possibly could jury rig the soundblaster of the set that only has the two wire lead to it.
9833	11	111374	1265647	1265619	ray harinec	6/26/05 5:51 pm	1.11980826e12	ok lets first eliminate	any possibility that the mobo is shorted to the mounting plate [via improper connection]. the mobo does get grounded to the mounting plate through the hex standoff's that are mounted to the mounting holes with the printed circuit ring about them. each of those holes are plated through holes and connect to each of, the layers of the mobo [usually four] and to the ground plane, thus they are connected to each other, and grounding them to the mounting plate is intended. many times people putting a new mobo into an old case forget to remove one of the hex stadoffs that don't line up with a mounting hole and that shorts some of the printed circuitry out. also had one case where the individual mounted the mobo directly to the mounting plate with no standoff's. the mobo survived. lol best test is to place the entire mobo on a large piece of cardboard to eliminate any possibility of shorts. do not lay it on elctrostatic foam or sheets, they are conductors. next is to validate that the supply has a high enough wattage rating. just a double check, because by disconnecting so much stuff the load should have been reduced enough so that any old supply would work. if the mobo is not shorted, remove the video card [reducing the load, on the supply further] to see if the supply comes on and stays on. if the power supply is good and still shuts down you are down to mobo, memory, or cpu [disregading any possiblity of a simple misconnection, relying on you for that]. takes quite a bit of current to shut the power supply overcurrent circuits to cause the supply to shut down, which then usually points to a fried cpu. i can tell you how to see if the power supply turns on properly [with no load] if you disconnect its leads from the mobo.
