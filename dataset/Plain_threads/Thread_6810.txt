2357	5	284735	2709928	2709865	wonder newb	2/20/08 6:28 pm	1.20353208e12	well	i havent actually recieved any components or software yet. just finalizing what i am going to buy for the os. the 4 gigs is to run games smoother, i hope it helps. although 4 gigs has gotten pretty cheap, only paying about $120 on newegg.
