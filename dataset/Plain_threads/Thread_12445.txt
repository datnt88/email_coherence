14301	2	318368	2918625	2918202	jennywren1420	12/1/08 3:17 pm	1.22814462e12	useful info	thanks for the useful recommendation. j&r had a three speaker pairs in that range and a bit higher for their cyber monday sale that sounded promising (harmon multimedia jbl duet, altec lansing v52420 and logitech 980-000023 s-220), but i couldn't determine, from the descriptions or from reviews of them from cnet , whether they fulfilled the specs you mentioned. i'm just not familiar with the terms, as described, so though at least two of those brought enthusiastic reviews, overall, i think i ought to follow your guidance. getting something that didn't work would be a real pain, and as you say, my needs are simple: hearing what the computer is transmitting, watching a movie, perhaps, or listening to some music but not requiring anything super in the transmission. (i can always use my stereo if i want to satisfy my urge for high-quality sound.) i'm not even sure that my computer is up to producing anything worthy of more expensive speakers or those with more pleasing sound. so, when i get a chance, i shall trot off to radio shack (there's one near me) and get a pair of the speakers. thanks again, so much. jenny

(still powered ones though.) there are speakers out there that do not require any power but the audio output of your mac does not have enough ooomph to make them work. the sound it produces requires amplification before it is strong enough to hear and for this, the speakers need power. the jbl speakers are 120v powered as are the logitech ones. i didn't find any information on the altec lansing v52420 and i now know that is because it is actually a vs2420! (tsk tsk) this one will be good too as it is also 120v powered. so, whichever one you fancy from j & r will be good for your machine. of course, you can still check out radio shack. let us know what you decide p

(multiplied by all the others who are doings as i am doing, it's a lot of energy use.) but the cable guy told me never to turn off the modem, and i've no idea what turning off or unplugging the router would do, so i go on, a bit shamefacedly, letting them all glow or blink without hindrance. &lt;sigh&gt; thank you for the guidance, p. the radio shack speakers were just fine, but i found the harman jbl sound mellower, and though that wasn't what i started out looking for, it caught me, unawares. i listened to a schubert string quintet the other day and was surprised by how pleased i was, being able to listen and work in the same room. i hope that everyone's new year will play out happily and successfully. jenny
