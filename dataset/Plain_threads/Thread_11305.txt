10584	2	303567	2827024	2826766	ramarc	8/5/08 7:04 am	1.21791984e12	are you trying to do the mirror in the os or onboard raid?	you could setup the mirror via the os (vista or xp pro) but you'd be losing the speed of the existing striped volume. all onboard raid controllers that i know of would require 4 drives for a 1+0 setup.
