(2) that the bulbs are lower wattage than digitals? (3) other? my brother-in-law just gave me an older notebook computer to try out, after i mentioned my problem. he inherited it from a cousin, but he said it doesn't seem to be working. i never owned a notebook in my life. it's a 500 cs toshiba tecra with intel pentium. when i try hooking it up, a yellow lite lights up in the rightmost panel which has an icon that *seems* to look like a battery. but i don't understand why the display isn't lighting up - after all, it's plugged in... am i missing something?
