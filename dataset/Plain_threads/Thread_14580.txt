830	6	162854	1881626	1838568	inspectorgw	4/17/06 5:41 pm	1.14529566e12	bought one too, but have one problem with it	so far this monitor has been great except for one problem. the 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode. i cannot get it to work in digital mode. instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output. i can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. is this expected or should i exchange the monitor? i was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card.

830	8	162854	1885005	1881626	blank0mind	4/19/06 12:03 pm	1.14544818e12	it's the card, not the monitor	i had exactly the same problem with an old video card. it seems that some early dvi video cards can't support 1680 by 1050 over the dvi port, but will do so over the vga port. i upgraded my video card and now have it working at 1680 by 1050 in dvi mode.
830	9	162854	1885036	1838568	blank0mind	4/19/06 12:31 pm	1.14544986e12	some more info on video modes.	i also got this monitor, and one of the reasons i went for it over the similar lg monitor is that the samsung has the 3 video inputs. if you are looking for an hdtv, you should get an hdtv and not a computer monitor, but having the video inputs seemed useful to me. if you are looking at this monitor for its video inputs, you should be aware that the component video will only go up to a 480p signal. a &quot;film mode&quot; is available for interlaced video as well. the dvi port is hdcp compliant, so it looks like you might be able feed a hdtv signal to this monitor that way, but i can't find anywhere in the docs what hdtv resolution might be supported, if any. i'd guess 720p, but i do not have anything that makes a hdtv signal to test this with. anyway, i got this as a computer monitor and am very happy with it.
