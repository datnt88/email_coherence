(| &lt;-- that is the design. or like a letter d. |d now using symbols here, = for two rods, | for the connecting rod, - for the representation of the humerus. we have =|- as the basic design. i have to use more letter for a representation of the design d as one end, and p as the other. using this we create what the rod may look like. d----p. this being the two ends of the horizontal rod which will fit over the vertical one and allow motion based on a simple hinge design. like i said: put this together, take the credit, patent it, and you won't have to give anyone credit. it's also known as being lazy and not doing things for yourself.
