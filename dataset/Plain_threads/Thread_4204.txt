5448	6	575447	5372881	5372832	bob b	10/14/12 7:19 am	1.35019914e12	ram	the max supported speed for that mobo is pc2-5300. that mobo has 2 ram slots. each slot has a max of 2gb. look here.
5448	7	575447	5372885	5372831	vapcmd	10/14/12 8:55 am	1.3502049e12	probably want to do the bios update before changing the	cpu. if the system with the old bios doesn't recognize the new cpu, you'd have to reinstall the old cpu to do the bios updates. best to avoid going thru that. vapcmd
5448	8	575447	5372910	5372831	bob b	10/14/12 9:41 am	1.35020766e12	cpu	it looks like.....based on the cpu support list. the e6600/6700 will be your best fit. the machine has the latest bios since it sees the e2200. don't fuss with that bios unless you have to...........you can turn the machine into a brick.

5448	10	575447	5373097	5372831	willy	10/14/12 8:47 pm	1.35024762e12	what a bios update does	bios update, you need to check and verify what the current bios level is and compare to what the latest one is. that way, you see if there is a huge gap, you will need to update. while any bios update can potentially make your pc a brick, it will also if properly done, provide the greatest latitude of cpu to install. bios updates were released just for that purpose besides any other glitches or corrections they did. of course, you can buy the cpu and install and take it from there. however, if you get some cpu that &quot;suppose to work&quot; and doesn't generally speaking the bios update will more than likely correct that. in that case, you have to remove the new cpu return the old one and then bios update and when completed then install the new cpu. it would help that the support website provide what a bios update corrects or adds to the bios, but too often that is negated or very sparse. bios update: adds more cpus to recognize, handle ram better, correct glitches, mtrbd. options increased/eased among other things. if all this is greek to you, then allow someone locally to explain it all. i can only point you in the right direction and then you decide. i refrain from providing pc 101 courses. tada -----willy

5448	19	575447	5373371	5373310	willy	10/15/12 12:53 pm	1.35030558e12	if you dare...	you have me worried as i don't suspect to see what you see. i understand the cpu maybe stuck and that's because the heatsink compound has apparently adheared too well. this should have been done after some use of the pc, then try to remove the cpu as the heat itself will lessen the adhesion of cpu to heatsink. your mtrbd. has a small socket cage and the cpu better remain inside and not stuck to the heatsink. there is also a fan mounting cage which should allow you unmount, by unscrewing it. then you see the cpu mounted on socket. if you can, provide some pix, place some on a public viewing like photobucket. so, a real picture of your dealing with sorta thing. if in some way the actual cpu is shown, it must be removed by pulling-up with deft care and esd(static wrist band) being used in order to prevent static discharge damage. here is the mtrbd. showing no cpu and empty socket from support website.  there is no mounting setup for the fan shown. that comes later as part of the fan/heatsink install which has to be removed, you view what the cpu.  good luck ------willy
