9627	6	367745	3171775	3171640	ebotos	11/11/09 2:25 am	1.2579063e12	ok,	sure thing. thanks for ths input! i'll have another look around and see what else will run well. most importantly, i need something that can run an i7, can handle 2 gtx 925's in sli and will be a good starting place for overclocking in the future. i was mostly drawn to the r2e because i heard it made ocing far easier than most mobos.
9627	7	367745	3171809	3171640	ebotos	11/11/09 3:38 am	1.25791068e12	actually,	i would be most interested in hearing what you recommend to handle an i7 975, nothing extreme on the oc front, 6 gb corsair ddr3 1600, 2 gtx 295's sli and will fit in an antec 902? money isn't an issue, but obviously i don't want to blow money on a board that is just as good as a cheaper one but has features i probably won't need (3rd sli slot etc).
9627	8	367745	3172137	3171809	vapcmd	11/11/09 10:00 am	1.2579336e12	i'd look at the typical review sites...	tomshardware.com, anandtech.com, xbitlabs.com, etc. and also here for actual buyer/user reviews. here's a pretty complete list of the 1366 socket mb that newegg offers  there's lots to choose from and here's one i put in the 'possible' pile.  my biggest concern with the socket 1366 platform is that there are few boards on at places like newegg that get consistent high marks ....i mean 75-80% 5's, some 4 and very few 3's, 2's and 1's. instead most are rated 50-60% 5's, 5-20%...4's, a few 3's 2's and too many 1's. make sure you pick a good psu to go with that rig... the evga gtx295 says...'minimum of a 680 power supply (minimum recommended power supply with +12 volt current rating of 46 amps.). let us know what you decide. vapcmd
