3678	2	407641	3365576	3365534	xijilia	8/29/10 2:16 pm	1.28309136e12	you should read what you recommend before you reply	it is not well covered i reviewed the suggestions in the thread & they are masks not fixes. turning off valid warnings from windows, buying external hubs, downgrading usb 2.0 to usb 1.0, replacing power supplies and all of the other suggestions are wrong bob. after 23 years in it i think i would not waste my time to post a true solution in a forum only to be chided by a forum moderator. i resent your condescending response because you obviously did not bother to read my post or the posts in the thread you refer to. you were an active participant in the thread so you should have realized my post was not a repeat of any information contained in the 14 pages of discussion the systems with the problem folks are asking about obviously cant wake from hibernation & sleep properly and the usb ports are properly reporting a surge. the correct solution is to disable hibernation & sleep so the usb ports dont take a shot every time the system wakes up! furthermore i challenge you to find the fix i posted someplace else bob. i doubt you will find anything anywhere on the web mentioning it. unless it is a forum that i just posted to submitting the same details i sent you. furthermore if you even bothered to read the posts in the link you sent me you would have seen that disabling hibernation and sleep is not mentioned a single time. additionally after reading all of the some 200 posts you refer to, i saw you several times encouraging people to do a bunch of useless gyrations like applying patches and buying new parts or telling them they have bad hardware. when all they had to do was disable hibernation & sleep.

3678	5	407641	3369814	3369825	r. proffitt	9/5/10 3:40 am	1.283658e12	if we set aside	or go for something that helps put the usb back into operation we have the long discussion at  and many suggestions. i find turning off the notification does return the usb to operation but this will never placate those that want a &quot;true fix.&quot; for that the makers have to issue new hardware, bios and drivers. (good luck?) bob
3678	6	407641	3370208	3369825	xijilia	9/5/10 9:03 pm	1.28372058e12	happy to help	just email me xijilia @ gmai.com (my response will come from another email account because i don't want to post my details here. in case you don't know there should be no spaces before & after the @ in the email address i gave you) i don't feel like bickering with the moderator of this forum over this issue further. drop me a note and i can fix it for you if you want n/c just a random act of kindness.

3678	8	407641	3374419	3370334	xijilia	9/13/10 3:01 pm	1.28439006e12	is alan funt in the house? you have got to be joking!	a quote from your last post as a reminder and if you want to truly give the forum the kindness you say you have, all you need to do is share how you are solving it. i see 3 options here bob: 1: you are schizophrenic 2: you are trying to be annoying & difficult 3: you just do not read things posted in this forum. i started this stupid thread by posting the fix from the very start!!! you scoffed at it and pointed me to a useless link saying this was well covered i disputed you and you called me don quixote. you have refused to acknowledge a proper resolution that i provided to this forum , even though the symptoms make perfect sense. any professional worth their weight in salt should remember that a large percentage of older systems could never properly manage waking from hibernation & sleep without causing a barrage of strange problems. it should always be the first option to disable before crippling other system settings & devices. i posted here because i saw people struggling with something so simple and attempted to save someone aggravation and instead i have spent more time exchanging non pleasantries with you than i did fixing my clients pc and posting what i found to be the fix. a fix that is mentioned nowhere on any forum! whatever! im so done with this ridiculous nonsense & this thread. if someone needs help with this they can email me i will help them. if they feel like it they can post here and report back to you. i kindly posted the fix for you in my first 2 posts. while it may not fix every usb surge problem, it is the fix for a sony viao pcv-rs310 aka pcv-2222 that was fine prior to factory restore and no has usb devices attached when the message appears. fini
