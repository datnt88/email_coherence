9141	3	322828	2940931	2940433	cameojoe	12/31/08 6:56 pm	1.23074976e12	thanks	thanks for the quick responses guys. yup, i was just a tired moron last night and didnt plug in the power for the second card, d'oh!. however, while the second card is hooked up and working, with sli-enabled in the nvidia control panel, i have a bit of a snag. under graphics settings in gta iv, my &quot;resources available&quot; is exactly the same and i see minimal graphic improvement. i have found changing the view distance from 1 to 70 (max amt it will let me push it) there is very little difference in viewing distance or graphics improvement. the only difference is when its maxed out my camera movements are a little jagged. otherwise the game runs pretty much the same as on one card (it fairly good to start out with, i suppose). any thoughts by anybody? thanks for your time -hendrik
