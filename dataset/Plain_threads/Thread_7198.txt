2877	3	572097	5356827	5356644	r. proffitt	9/6/12 8:08 am	1.34691888e12	yes that's what i mean.	if you read reviews by cnet of bd players and hdtvs any unit that does not do 24p playback usually gets dinged. since tablets and pcs can't do 24p on the internal display and i've yet to see 24p output from a tablet, it's easy to write that bd playback fails on the tablets. not to duplicate the widrive web page, the answer is yes. bob
2877	4	572097	5356964	5356827	poegiovanni	9/6/12 11:36 am	1.34693136e12	..	okay, so nothing will be blu-ray quality, i can do with dvd then. not a problem there. and i looked at the wi-drive, but if i place movies on it, and want to watch them while on a flight, then i would think that there would be a problem with the wi-fi on a plane, even if it is only localized. or is it okay, because it would be so localized?

2877	7	572097	5357119	5357101	r. proffitt	9/6/12 8:31 pm	1.34696346e12	seems a trivial step.	i'm maintaining old palmos apps and the same story way back then. if you put an app on the card, behind your back it copies it to onboard memory before it launches. seems to be pretty easy to work with. isn't ics outdated now with jellybean out? why consider anything unless it's the latest unless the price is right? with google nexus and the new kindle fire hd's out i think the next few weeks will see a fire sale on older units. one might be just what you want. bob

2877	9	572097	5357099	5357130	poegiovanni	9/6/12 9:11 pm	1.34696586e12	memory issue	that is just it, i don't want it to copy what is on the card. if i get a 16 gb model that is 33% full with apps, books, and such, and i have a 16 gb card that is 75% full with movies, it can't copy everything from the card to the memory. and i don't want it to. i specifically want the card to be expandable memory, so i can have the os, books, some music, and any apps that i want on the tablet memory, and i want to be able to put movies onto a sd card so i can swap them out. i want to be keep the tablet memory as clean as possible. as to jelly bean, well, if worse comes to worse, i have a guy that can do some stuff for me if needed.
