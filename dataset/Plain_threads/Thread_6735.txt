4619	7	110193	1271450	1252516	john robie	6/29/05 1:53 pm	1.12005318e12	well..........	stuff like that happens when you either get a virus, trojan, or in some cases spyware. do you have: a anti-virus program? a firewall? spyware programs like both: adaware and spybot and ms anti-spyware all above can be obtained free. ps...hope you are not listening to music from some of those p2p sites that can cause that kind of problem.

4619	16	110193	1274982	1274409	john robie	7/1/05 9:53 am	1.12021158e12	wife's non-lemon emachine	will not be replaced with another emachine as she will get one of my other two (non-emachine) desktops when and if her current emachine starts to malfunction causing some $'s. she uses her ($450) emachine every day for web surfing, printing, producing photo's with a scanner, and has even made cd's with it. she also plays her type games on it, but will use my more powerful desktop for later high end games. i am able to fix just about anything that may go wrong with my computers. have noticed through the years that the root of the majority of computer problems started with the operator. sorry to hear about your problems.
