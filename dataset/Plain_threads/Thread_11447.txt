573	3	400244	3334233	3333713	ramarc	7/5/10 7:15 pm	1.2783573e12	fine as is but skip the liquid cooling	the 2gb 5870 might be a nice boost if you're running at 1920x1080 (24&quot;) or higher resolution. anything lower and the 1gb version would be fine. also, don't fret over corsair-vs-adata. unless you're willing to tweak your system by hand, you won't notice the difference. as for liquid-cooling, all phenoms will work fine with air-cooling. you should only consider liquid cooling if you're trying to reach a crazy overclock and are willing to spend the time and effort to tweak-tweak-tweak!
573	4	400244	3335441	3334233	brechan	7/8/10 1:43 am	1.27855338e12	i agree with ramarc	in all regards (especially the liquid cooling); please note that if you are building this yourself, many manufacturers won't support liquid cooling leaks as a reason to rma a component. if you really want liquid cooling for your rig; consider coolit systems  or the corsair h50
573	5	400244	3335927	3333711	ilsmangent	7/8/10 11:59 pm	1.27863354e12	no sound card?	if you're going to go all out on this machine, i would think you'd want more than an on-board card. have you considered getting a soundcard? what's the purpose of this computer?
573	6	400244	3335953	3333711	brechan	7/9/10 1:12 am	1.27863792e12	is a 6 core cpu really necessary?	or could you get by with an amd 965be quad core cpu? i only ask because if this rig is for gaming, there aren't too many games that will utilize a hexi-core cpu. if this is for gaming; maybe put the extra cash into an 890fx motherboard instead
573	7	400244	3336808	3335953	tbrown37	7/10/10 9:04 am	1.27875264e12	thanks for the help so far!	the 1gb card for sure and a-data gaming series it is. this rig is for gaming. i'm not too picky about the sound quality but i 'could' get a sound card if needed it would only be added luxury. i would get the 965be but for the 1055t it's 26$ more to add on. thanks for the replies everyone. :] though with me being in the middle of a move i have to wait till i order my computer about another two months. i am going to save up some more so when the time does come i can get an intel machine with the rest of the build identical.
