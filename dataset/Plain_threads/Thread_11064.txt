2240	2	559853	5294247	5294155	f250_	4/2/12 3:19 pm	1.33337994e12	thanks for the confirmation and &quot;heads up&quot;, bob...	right now, i know that the netgear router i'm using (the one i'm planning to use as a wap) works with the nas i have. i'm not overly concerned about netflix since we do not have an account and do not plan to get one. however, in the event i need a work around, is there one... in other words, is there a way to create a &quot;white list&quot; which the router would then accept for connectivity, or am i just stuck with whatever the built-in firewall is designed to allow? i understand that each router model may have a variety of options for firewall configuration, but this is &quot;new ground&quot; for me and i like to understand my potential options. thanks again.

2240	4	559853	5294257	5294227	f250_	4/2/12 5:09 pm	1.33338654e12	gotcha...	that means that my sole defense is the software firewalls in each device connected to the internet, then, right, and the extra benefit of the router's firewall is simply gone? well, at least i know. still, i'll dig into the configuration details on the 4500 when i get it up and running. right now, i'm waiting on my cat6a cable to arrive. i'll probably go ahead and run the coax this weekend so that everything is almost ready to plug and play when the ethernet cable arrives. thanks again, bob. pete

2240	6	559853	5294328	5294268	f250_	4/2/12 9:16 pm	1.33340136e12	maybe i don't really understand...	my concern lies in making sure that all my private documents and data are kept well away from anyone who might wander in and try to hack my information. anyway, what is nat? where does it reside? disabling the firewall within the router does not disable nat? i'm really showing my networking ignorance here. if you know of a source where all this is explained in non-technical terms, i'll be happy to review the information off line and not waste your time with trying to bring me up to speed on it.
2240	7	559853	5294470	5294328	r. proffitt	4/3/12 7:29 am	1.33343814e12	what is nat? (edited.)	it's how these &quot;routers&quot; perform the internet sharing. since an inbound connection is not routed to any machine unless you configure the router to do so, these are dropped and well, how would they get to your files? i wish i could write it in less technical terms but my bet is that this is why everyday folk gobble up this firewall feature without much research. let's say that all old routers that didn't have this new firewall were vulnerable. you would think this would be marketed and create millions of sales to replace the old gear. bob
2240	8	559853	5294681	5294470	f250_	4/3/12 1:02 pm	1.33345812e12	my understanding is growing...	ok. i've skimmed some online docs which describe nats to varying degrees, most being technically over my head, but i think i'm getting the picture. i also spent some time glancing through the user manual for the new gigabit router i bought, and the default settings for the router's firewall are &quot;disabled&quot; for incoming and &quot;enabled&quot; for outgoing. i also have the option of establishing the nat as either &quot;secure&quot; or &quot;open&quot;. from everything you've shared, bob, and the little bit of understanding i've gained through additional skimming around the net, i assume that my best starting point is to accept the default firewall settings and leave teh nat as &quot;secure&quot;. am i correct? thanks again for your patience and time, bob. i am not oblivious to how much time it can take to bring someone up to speed on something they don't understand to begin with. i've done it many times myself with &quot;newbies&quot; in the automotive enthusiast forum i frequent. pete
