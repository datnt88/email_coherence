(be sure to indicate you want to restore all partitions.) before you do, though, it's advisable to clone the hard drive so that if something goes wrong you're not up a creek without a paddle. best of luck. john p.s. in response to your pm, cnet doesn't enable the editing of your own posts due to the potential for abuse of the feature.
