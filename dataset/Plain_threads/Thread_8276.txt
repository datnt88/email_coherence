14928	6	280627	2684229	2684246	phasere	1/20/08 12:13 pm	1.20083118e12	not sure...	i'm not sure i know what you mean. do i need to use xp floppies prior to cd install when doing a fresh install to new sata drive?

14928	8	280627	2684519	2684258	phasere	1/20/08 10:00 pm	1.2008664e12	still doing it...	even after loading the sata drivers prior to install xp still doesn't give me any option to format the partition as anything other than raw.
14928	9	280627	2684721	2684519	r. proffitt	1/21/08 7:23 am	1.20090018e12	here's the deal.	even in the xp installer we don't format the drive. all through your post i see you formatting which is not a proper thing to do. let me put it to you one last time. 1. we have the xp sp2 cd. 2. we have the sata driver diskette to use during the xp sp2 boot (f6) 3. we delete the partitions with the the xp installer. 4. we create the partition we need (and no others!) with the xp installer. 5. the xp install formats the volume. at no time did i format the drive. if you do this and it doesn't work then your setup/hardware is defective. bob

14928	13	280627	2686128	2685340	phasere	1/22/08 5:23 pm	1.20102258e12	hmm that thought crossed my mind.	i'll give it a shot and let you know what i find. thanks for the info.
14928	14	280627	2696462	2685340	phasere	2/4/08 7:10 am	1.202109e12	that worked!	thanks for your suggestion, i wiped the drive and let xp format it then created the secondary partition after the xp install. cheers! john
