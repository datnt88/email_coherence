9690	19	305800	2842115	2842111	r. proffitt	8/25/08 10:30 am	1.2196602e12	then why didn't you?	look at the dhcp table to get what ip addresses were handed out and enable the management from the wan on the second router? hint? the ip address is there and you must configure the router before this will work. it appears you want tech support and not a guide or discussion. bob

9690	22	305800	2842171	2842147	chris_sundown13	8/25/08 11:15 am	1.2196629e12	wrong forum.	i know how to use my d-link trouter which is what the link was for. how has that to do with my t mobile one?
