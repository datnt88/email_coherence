4733	5	52146	624536	621700	onebione	12/20/04 10:17 pm	1.10358102e12	agreed	yes, plextor is the leader. though more expensive, the issue with dvd burners are basically how good are the software and how many discs will be compatible with it. as far as i know, plextor works with a bunch of them. if you always use good disks (ritek) you can buy a cheaper burner. i use lite-on and ritek disc. never go wrong. you can check out whosave.com storage section, maybe something good is on sale.
