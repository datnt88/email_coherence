(--) maybe the only characters it can access within its limited memory space as it could be any character(s). imho, evga, is a cheap outfit as they been offering items on their own recently and mostly at the bottom end. only now do i see high prcied offering, but i avoid such myself. -----willy
11955	8	231391	2421988	2391993	hcstreetriding	3/5/07 7:54 pm	1.17312444e12	let us know how responsive the mfg is.	my deaf and blind dog that has no legs is more responsive. so i got the new motherboard. terrible process, evga must not know how email works or something because they are terrible at communication. this one works, but im not getting a terrible noise from the processor?? im going to reseat it and see if that helps, if not im guessing its the motherboard because it never did that before. are they supposed to send you brand new ones when u rma it? or do they send you the ones that they used to test, or ones they fixed or something? this one is clearly not new. didnt even have to put pressure on the memory sticks, they slid right in, all four slots, in my past experiences that has never ever happened even when ive removed and replaced the memory tons of time. im getting really frustrated with this and and beginning to wish i would have bought the board from bfg, ive had such a great experience with them.
11955	9	231391	2422013	2421988	vapcmd	3/5/07 8:27 pm	1.17312642e12	so you bought another evga ? all you needed was a new bios	chip which evga could have furnished but i know some mfgs charge for the new eeprom and shipping. and as someone else suggested there are also third party vendors that can provide the flashed eeprom for your system. you remove the old eeprom and insert the new one. i like the replacement eeprom solution from the mfg or the third party if that's all that's wrong with the mb. when you rma a mb, mfgs may furnish new a brand new mbw however i have seen rmas get replaced with other rma boards that weren't defective or repaired mbs including some older revisions of the board. ugh. vapcmd vapcmd
11955	10	231391	2422266	2422013	hcstreetriding	3/6/07 6:30 am	1.1731626e12	i asked about the bios chip	and they said no just to send it back, they refused to even discuss the bios or anything to do with it. i would have contacted phoenix and replaced it myself but i didnt want to void the warranty in case something else goes wrong. and im beginning to believe now that im stuck with another dud. im going to try to contact someone there that has a clue what there doing and see if they have the capacity of mind to explain to my why they cannot communicate with customers and why i have another board that is making a bunch of noise and under performing compared to the other one i had. if they cant do something for me im just gona tell em to shove it and ill spend the money on a new one from bfg.
