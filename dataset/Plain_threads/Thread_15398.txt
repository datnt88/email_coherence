(mine has a $$$ replacement/repair warranty on attached devices. (2) you stated the cpu boots, but you have no control. hd works. the motherboard has a problem. (3) do you have a spare slot, and can invest less than $20? if so, get or borrow a usb 2.0 card, and see if that works. your system is booting: psu, video card, and hard drive are working. it's the usb and serial ports that are out.
