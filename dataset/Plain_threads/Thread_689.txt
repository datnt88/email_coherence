9009	10	271085	2725965	2721734	hawk9934	3/10/08 7:52 am	1.20513552e12	actually i did not forget that	what you have forgotten is that with epson's lawsuit against ninestar, generic cartridges for epson's are illegal. while refilled are legal with reset chips, no one in the industry has yet to figure out how to reset the epson 9-pin chip. reason: the chip has a kill feature once it is empty, so you can not reset it. so currently you are stuck with new cartridges from epson. now if you stay up to date in the cartridge industry, which i do because i am in it, you will know that refilled canon cli-8 and pgi-5's with reset chips have just came out in the past couple months. i have personally used these cartridges and have came to find out they work great. if you look at my original post, i only compared new to new, so the originator of the thread saw apples to apples. a printer buyer can not factor in replacement or refilled cartridges into the cost of the cartridges. why not? with this particular epson and canon, they are/were not available. plus some people choose not to use replacement or refilled cartridges.

9009	13	271085	2749957	2746076	hawk9934	4/12/08 5:28 am	1.20797808e12	refill the #5 & #8	while you can refill those cartridges, the problem is the chip. if you do a search on google for the refilled cartridges, make sure they have a reset chip. if i remember right, you need to hit certain keys on the panel of the mp530, if you refill the cartridges themselves, in order for it to work.
9009	14	271085	2749995	2625515	foodfiend	4/12/08 6:31 am	1.20798186e12	bought it-- now wish i hadn't!	okay, i would have look at this more carefully if the post about the cost of the ink cartridges had been posted at the time i was researching this subject, but we needed a printer asap. i will never buy a printer from epson. first, the 9400 a-i-o drinks ink like... (well, there was an analogy about my college days and beer, but i'll leave that one out). let's just say that i now figure that i will change the black ink cartridges three times more often than my previous hp, and the color ink carts maybe twice as often. if i am lucky. i don't do an awful lot of printing, and i have to manually set it to print &quot;text&quot; rather than &quot;image&quot; each time (which saves ink but is annoying). there should be a default setting which i can change, but i can't figure it out and i darn well am not contacting them to find out since the annoyance factor would be so very much higher to deal with them than to adjusting the setting before each printing job. epson tech support is a toll call. cripes. the one time i felt forced to use it, i called in the evening to avoid a long wait and still was on hold for a rep for over 10 minutes. after a long discussion where we went through steps i had already taken to correct the malfunction, which did not work (and i told her this), i was told that the unit would have to be replaced. after a 35-minute long-distance call. i don't care if it cost 10 cents to do this, they should have toll-free tech support, at least for the first year! epson tech support online is awful. i am a rather organized, logical person. when something doesn't work correctly, i go through the troubleshooting option. if this doesn't help, i write a detailed, concise e-mail describing the problem. twice i have had to e-mail epson with a problem, and both times i receive a response that shows me that the person did not bother read my message beyond the first couple of sentences. it's as though this person notices a few key words, then pulls up a troubleshooting document and sends it off to me. this is so annoying. note: if you are in the middle of printing a large document (like, my taxes yesterday) and you run out of ink, once you replace the cartridge the printer does not remember where it was in the printing queue. unfortunately, these tax docs were not numbered and i had to count each sheet and restart at page 46. again, annoying. i cringe when i need to send a fax. it just is not as easy as the hp was. so. i paid about $110 for the epson. i'm thinking that if i struggle with it for a year, it would have paid itself off (in my mind) and i can donate it somewhere (although why would i do that to some poor nonprofit agency?) and go back to hp. you can bet, though, that i will remember all that i dislike about this espon cx9400 and run like crazy from any printer which may have me dealing with a similar situation.
9009	15	271085	2760982	2648853	milliemouse	4/28/08 7:12 am	1.20936672e12	cartridges for epson cx6000 will also work in epson cx9400	we allready had a epson cx6000 and located a source for alternative cartridges. we found that the cx6000 cartridges also worked in the cx9400. they are often out of stock but they can be found at a much more reasonable cost than epson cartridges. you have to make certain that the cx6000 cartridges are for the version after may 0f 2007, when epson decided to change it's technology in an attempt to prevent the use of affordable cartridges.

9009	20	271085	2853047	2788145	kentuckyranger	9/8/08 2:05 pm	1.2208827e12	i almost purchased the epson r2880, untill my r260 died...	i was about to make the jump into more professional printing and get a large format printer. since getting the epson r260 for cd/dvd printing i was impressed by its quality so i had decided to go with the r2880 over the h p b9180, thank god i waited! this past week my r260 was getting very low on ink so i purchased oem replacement cartrages from a reputable nation wide dealer. when i installed the new cartrages the printer said they wheren't genuine epson cartrages and wouldn't let me print, it just froze up! i tried everything including replacing the new cartrages with the old, booting the printer with no cartrages, etc... to no avail. after doing some reaserch online i found out that epson did this intentionally to not only keep us from using third party cartrages, but it also has an internal counter that when it reaches a certain number of prints and passes with the print head, it disables the unit thus requiring you to replace it. i don't know if hewlettt packard does this kind of thing to its customers but the hp's i've used over the years have done me well. the only time they quit on me was when i wore them out mechanically after thousands of prints. i'm going to use hp printers from now on...
