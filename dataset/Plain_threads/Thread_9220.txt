5166	2	307250	2849595	2849428	darton fury	9/4/08 12:45 pm	1.2205323e12	simple answer	each computer on the network must put data packets inside of &quot;frames&quot; in order to move that data to another system. frames use mac addresses, not ip addresses. lookup arp, address resolution protocol.

5166	5	307250	2852391	2851950	darton fury	9/7/08 6:32 pm	1.22081232e12	not true	arp is used all the way up to the gateway, therefore ip alone is not sufficient to send data within your network. you can't build an ethernet frame without mac address. ethernet frames do not even contain an ip address. size of the network is not an issue either.
5166	6	307250	2852495	2851950	navneetgaur	9/7/08 11:44 pm	1.22083104e12	mac address.	yep. and for darton fury. roughly data is built and transferred from one computer to another as in stages 1 to 4 and rebuilt 4 to 1. 1. segment - 'tcp + data' 2. packet - 'ip + tcp + data' 3. frame - 'lh + ip + tcp + data + lt' 4. transmit bits. ( stuff/electrical signal transferred over the ethernet cable) tcp = tcp information ip = ip related information (ip addresss) lh = link header lt = link trailer lh and lt refer to data link layer header and trailer (mac info) source of reference - ccna intro by wendell odom - cisco press (ccie no. 1624) page 30. tcp /ip is a very large concept in itself. different components play a different role for supporting and maintaining connectivity. arp is a part of that but not relevant to the question asked. take care. both of you.
5166	7	307250	2852681	2849428	navneetgaur	9/8/08 8:04 am	1.22086104e12	specifically for darton fury	hi. this post is meant to clarify the concept of arp: 1. arp or address resolution protocol is meant to map the ip address to its interface mac address. period. 2. for example: computer-1 has an ip address 1.1.1.1 and mac address 11 router intface-1 has an ip address 1.1.1.2 and mac address 12 router intface-2 has an ip address 2.1.1.1 and mac address 21 computer-2 has an ip address 2.1.1.2 and mac address 22 arp cache: ip-1.1.1.1 mac-11 ip-1.1.1.2 mac-12 ip-2.1.1.1 mac-21 ip-2.1.1.2 mac-22 3. the process of transmitting data from computer-1 to computer-2 all over again: at computer-1:- stage-1 source-ip 1.1.1.1 source-mac 11 destination-ip 2.1.1.2 destination-mac - ? stage-2 now the computer will check its interface settings to clear up a question where should i send the data packets meant for other networks? the answer is the gateway information set up at the interface. note data packets, as they still do not have required mac information attached, to qualify them as frames next the computer will query the mac address from the arp cache or send an arp request to the gateway ip 1.1.1.2 for its mac address. stage-3 now a frame will be built as follows and forwarded to router interface-1 source-ip 1.1.1.1 source-mac 11 destination-ip 2.1.1.2 destination-mac 12 stage-4 at the router interface-1, a question needs to be answered. where to send the data meant for network 2.0.0.0 ? as the final destination lies in the network 2.0.0.0. the answer will be in the routers routing table which will inform it that the data should be forwarded to ip-2.1.1.1. next question is - what is the mac address of ip-2.1.1.1? this is answered using arp and built into a new frame with the original packet. packet has the ip and tcp information with the data. frame has additional mac information which is stripped and renewed at each passing interface. and so on. 4. for a small network any protocol based on single address scheme would suffice. but that would limit the size of the network to the address available within that protocol. the design of the tcp/ip protocol has been structured so as to support segments of networks and ability to interconnect them with each other using the process known as routing. if the above requirements were redundant, then, theoretically, a small network would definitely function on ip address alone. i hope that it is understood, about the preceding statement, that tcp/ip would have to be redesigned to work without mac address support for such a specific scenario. take care.
5166	8	307250	2852781	2852681	slackenerny	9/8/08 9:02 am	1.22086452e12	hmmmm	this may sound very dumb but i think i will just exonerate myself for asking this by claiming that i'm a novice. so routers have actually been programmed to automatically &quot;unwrap&quot; every single data frame that it receives so as to read the ip address &quot;underneath&quot; it (or should i say &quot;above&quot; since the network layer is on top) and then re-encapsulate them and send them away? so i think the reason for the mac address (data link layer) being necessary even though the ip addresses themselves are already unique is because when relaying a message from point a to point b to point c, and that point a and point c are actually not in direct contact (viz cannot communicate node to node) and must go through point b so must use the mac address to make sure the message has gone to the correct middleman/men. i think i've got it!! but maybe if we're deploying ipv6, where every networking hardware can be allocated its unique ip address, then having this mac address may not be really necessary? i mean theoretically we can modify the protocol to something like this: source ip address destination ip address ip address on the next relay &lt;-- this plays the role of mac address but maybe that'd be too much work.
