3249	5	300988	2810658	2810519	darrellm2005rockets	7/12/08 11:33 pm	1.21590558e12	..	okay, let me clear this up. yes, i really want to do this (unless it is just ridiculously expensive), no i can't just get a new computer. i have a modern computer. it is the family computer. the one i want to fix up is my computer. i use it for my music, and to play old computer games that are not compatible with the computers of today. i want to upgrade it so that it does these two things better, and so i can use to for any other off-line stuff i need to do. so, with that out of the way, i would be eternally grateful if someone would be so kind as to answer my question.

(see original post)

3249	14	300988	2811094	2810981	darrellm2005rockets	7/13/08 6:57 pm	1.21597542e12	it doesn't have an hx chipset...	it says intel pentium with mmx technology. i have also learned that mine is 200 mhz. i googled it,and it appears to be completely different from the one you are talking about. please look at the page. it has four sockets for ram, and it says nothing about a tag ram socket, so hopefully that won't be an issue. i have decided to go with two more 32mb ram cards (i just made the name up, as i didn't know what to call them) giving me 128mb of ram. now, the next item on my list is a video card. i really am in need of assistance on this one.....

3249	16	300988	2811272	2810962	bob b	7/14/08 6:47 am	1.21601802e12	fwiw.	your call.
3249	17	300988	2811273	2811272	r. proffitt	7/14/08 6:51 am	1.21601826e12	notice fpm and edo options?	this is truly the old timewarp issue. way back when those fpm machines were left in the dust when we moved to edo. the owners that &quot;invested&quot; in fpm sticks were miffed over the memory technology advances. anyhow, you see the &quot;maybe&quot; word here and there on this board. and again i think this is a don't do it machine. you can find better, for free on freecycle. bob
3249	18	300988	2811402	2811273	bob b	7/14/08 10:04 am	1.21602984e12	i won't argue.	i expressed my opinion in the beginning....don't do that. the user wants to do this. it's the user's money. it's the user's headache. looks like a money pit and a can of worms to me. maybe it's a labor of love.
3249	19	300988	2811504	2811232	darrellm2005rockets	7/14/08 12:54 pm	1.21604004e12	oops	sorry, the moment i saw intel i thought &quot;proccessor&quot;. okay, so i might not be able to get more ram, (though i will search around for that tag ram thingamijig) but what about getting it a better video card? at the vere least, i want to do that.
3249	20	300988	2811515	2811504	r. proffitt	7/14/08 12:58 pm	1.21604028e12	said tag ram spotted.	in other systems being dumped on freecyle or dumpsters. again, a friend scored a pentium 3 complete and moved their hard disk over. for just watching the freecycle. be aware that even with the tagram many of this boards behave just like the fellow that did the high dive into the empty pool. it's not pretty. bob
