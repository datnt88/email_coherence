(??) anyways, i was due to get a new machine anyway (was longing for a desktop) so got a sony tp1 last week (which runs on vista). when i connected the harddrive vista crashed. i then tried to connect the harddrive back to my laptop bt it keeps asking me to format the harddrive (if it actually recognises the harddrive). 2 questions: 1) i want to save my music collection (and myself from ripping all of it all over again, which took me months) and wondered if there is anything i can do to retrieve the data. i can't even access the directory in dos mode. 2) i only recently had the same problem with another 80gb harddrive of mine, which was about three years old so i assumed it was normal wear and tear. this mybook harddrive is less than 4 months old, so very strange. could it be some virus causing that? i ran antivirus and spywareblaster on it and nothing came up for it. how can i avoid it again next time? the harddrive stands around on a table most of the time, its not anywhere where it would be moved a lot, or could overheat. btw, i did read the comments about not using an external harddrive as the only backup. i never had any problems until recently but will avoid that in future. any help is appreciated. thanks. shareque

15111	3	270647	2623259	2623088	shaquk	11/6/07 1:45 am	1.1943135e12	unfortunately itw as the only place i stored my music	as my music collection was over 60gb, and i only had 80 gb disc space on my laptop it just seemed a waste to keep it all on the laptop. i unfortunately formatted my 40gb ipod just recently and was able to retrieve only 20gb worth of music from it. so anything i can do to get the data back? any program? last time this happened with my old harddrive i ended up paying 200 ($400) to retrieve the data. i dont want to do this all over again. i am happy to pay for an effective program and be able to use it if this ever happens again. also, anyone has an answer why this keeps happening? could it be a virus which creates bad clusters?
