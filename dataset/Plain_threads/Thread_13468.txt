(assume latency and speed cannot be changed) case 1: two 1 gb rams (ddr2 800, 5-5-5-12, 1.8v) with each ram sold separately. -or- case 2: two 1 gb rams (ddr2 800, 5-5-5-12, 1.8v) with both rams sold in one package under the name &quot;dual-channel&quot; my understanding is that as long as the motherboard is connected to two ram slots through two different bus and if the ram sticks have identical configuration, then what we get is a &quot;dual channel&quot; ram system. so, i am not sure if buying &quot;dual channel&quot; rams (case 2) is better than buying two rams with identical configuration (case 1). can you please clarify?
