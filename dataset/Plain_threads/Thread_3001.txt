4070	4	266097	2600440	2600447	ozos	10/6/07 11:08 am	1.19166888e12	well	honestly they're going to be about equal, i'd go with the quad core just to give yourself a little more piece of mind, but generally theres no more or no less future proofing offered by the kentsfield over the 6850

(so even if it isnt good enough for you, *which i doubt*, you still have the oportunity to make it faster :d) 5) i dont think there will be a game it wont play for quite a while. lol look i dont know all the specs, for it im sorry but if ur in the market for a gaming pc, a q6600 while definately be lovely to play on. just make sure u get a decent gpu to go with it!!! (im getting the nvidia xfx 8800gtx which is a bit excessive but i would recommend it. if not in ur price range maybe go for the 8800 gts 320 or 640mb versions. its all good ps. happy gaming

4070	8	266097	2632801	2632669	ozos	11/18/07 8:50 pm	1.195419e12	alright, some holes in your logic	while it may look like a 400% performance increase with new technology and what not, the q6600 is essentially two core 2 duos bolted together, its a multi-core module, which means its tech is identical to the core 2 duo furthermore, a guy named gene amdahl gave us amdahl's law which defines scalability of an application mathematically, and shows us that 4 cores will never realistically = a 4x performance increase:  's_law with that said, the core 2 duo is just as good for gaming if money is an issue, although the quad core isn't a bad buy, i just wanted to put some facts straight in the thread if people were using it as a reference
4070	9	266097	2825698	2632801	jcitizen	8/3/08 10:27 am	1.21775922e12	your right but....	if you application/game is capable of splitting tasks between cores, and actually utilizing their advantage, you literally have four &quot;computers&quot; in one, to run one application. there is no way you cannot realize a performance gain. why do you think web-data base servers use this same technology to get information out on the web so fast? the problem is a lot of code writers are not taking advantage of this, in fact they haven't even caught up with the 64bit ram and data bus technology that is already there.
