7496	3	63908	759627	758787	trouble_is	2/12/05 11:46 am	1.10820876e12	it's not that it won't find it...	...it's that i have nowhere to enter the information manually for it to know what to find. i did some searching through the msn knowledge base and found a partial solution that dealt with disabling the windows zero configuration utility due to it not recognizing the driver for the pci card. before i did this, i could view the properties of the &quot;wireless connection&quot; icon but did not have a &quot;wireless networks&quot; tab, therefore i had no way of adding a wireless network and all of the settings involved to secure one after i disabled ssid broadcasting (article id 313242 - drivers that do not support the wireless zero configuration service - if you can view the properties of the wireless connection icon but you do not see the wireless networks tab, the network adapter driver does not fully support the wireless zero configuration service....) this allowed me to enter some of the information manually, then reactivate the configuration utility. i now have the mac filtering enabled and am not broadcasting the ssid. i also found the linksys wireless network monitor by going into the program in the hard drive and dragging that part of it to the system tray. this all may seem trivial and basic stuff to some of you, but for me this has been an exercise in frustration...lol to be told in several different places to open &quot;properties&quot; of the wireless connection, then select &quot;wireless networks&quot; - and there not being a &quot;wireless networks&quot; tab... now, if anyone needs to know anything about railroading or how to get your car running again, just ask me...lol thanks. rod
