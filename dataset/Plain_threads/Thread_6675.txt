5440	1	275615	2652993	2652983	kees bakker	12/13/07 5:28 am	1.19752368e12	which way?	most usb mice at the moment come with a small converter to use them with a ps/2 port. those don't need a driver. i just plug them in. the other way around, maybe? ps/2 keyboard or mouse in a usb port? what exactly is the make and model of your device? did you already check the makers site? kees
5440	2	275615	2652999	2652993	alexds9	12/13/07 5:48 am	1.19752488e12	it's a generic product.	ps/2 mouse & keyboard input, one usb output. windows 98/se/me/2000/xp has a built in support in this kind of devices. so it came with no drivers. but vista just recognize it. so i need drivers to install it.

5440	7	275615	2653447	2653170	alexds9	12/13/07 2:49 pm	1.19755734e12	i alredy tried to search for company name...	it goes something like: &quot;vpro&quot; or &quot;ovpro&quot; or &quot;covpro&quot;, some unclear logo... it doesn't really matter. it recognized automatically by all windows except vista. i think that xp drivers would be good enough.

5440	9	275615	2653779	2653489	alexds9	12/14/07 2:19 am	1.19759874e12	i did it...	usb legacy devices turned on, i can use the keyboard via adapter to choose safe mode or normal mode. so the adapter working. i turned off uac, restarted the computer. windows recogniozed the adapter but couldn't install it from internet or from the computer. in the device manager it's named: &quot;ps2 to usb converter&quot; with yellow exclamation mark. in the properties under general tab: &quot;a driver (service) for this device has been disabled. an alternate driver may be providing this functionality. (code 32) click 'check for solutions' to send data about this device to microsoft and to see if there is a solution available.&quot; driver tab: driver provider: &quot;unknown&quot; driver date: &quot;not available&quot; driver version: &quot;not available&quot; digital signer: &quot;not digital signed&quot; when i press on &quot;check for solutions...&quot;, i get message to download: &quot;update for windows vista, 32-bit versions (kb940199)&quot;. i downloaded it, and nothing happened.

5440	13	275615	2654627	2652983	alexds9	12/15/07 3:55 am	1.1976909e12	i have just installed vista service pack 1 rc.	the adapter was installed immediately. so now everything works fine. sp1 rc even solved another problem with drivers of my cell phone, sony ericsson z610i. i happy that microsoft released sp1 rc now. thanks to everyone how tried to help!
