(pump and res in my 5,25 bay). i've even placed my fan of the scythe mugen ii proc cooler for pull on other side of rad. idle 33-38c load 58-71c can't push my system further because i dont want to reach such high temps. how can i flush my system with water? is it possible that the cooling block is stuffed with dirt of some kind? he said he wasn't using it for 6 months to a year now. ive blown on the ends of the waterblock to get it cleared before ive installed it. ive replaced it with new cooling fluid (feser one). maybe you guys can help? thanks in advance!
