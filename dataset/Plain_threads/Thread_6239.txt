9284	9	532195	5160491	5160239	bob b	7/5/11 7:22 am	1.30985052e12	their shaky	if your using one of those monitor progs a good dose of skepticism will come in handy. i recall using one of those monitor tools that came from the mobo maker......the readings were nutty. if the mobo maker can't figure out how to get that info from &quot;their&quot; own board what chance does a third party tool have?
