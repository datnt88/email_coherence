12465	2	306036	2842245	2842116	bobcrane	8/25/08 12:55 pm	1.2196689e12	haven't tried anything yet...	it all happened right before i had to leave for work (where i am posting this right now). i do plan on swiping a keyboard temporarily to test it out. but otherwise... i may be right in assuming it's the keyboard? sure beats re-installing windows or some other drastic measure...
