(expensive) driving directions can be had at places like mapquest, on the internet, via your wireless broadband access and the safari web browser. for video and audio, the mac comes with ilife. a suite of integrated programs, itunes, iphoto, imovie(hd) and idvd that should suit your purpose. hope this helps p
