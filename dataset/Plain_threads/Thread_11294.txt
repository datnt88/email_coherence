11530	7	281435	2690775	2690048	mystery blue	1/28/08 4:17 am	1.20149382e12	ic	oh...i see now..i understand. sorry bob. i really did view the link. but i dont really understand completely so i guess i kinda asked stupid questions.. =s. sorry.. thanks a lot for explaining. hope i didnt make you unhappy.=s anyways.. thank you. now that clear out my doubts. =) but i still have 2 more questions, if you dont mind answering. 1.where does my 1gb ram goes to? is it like,in cases when applications used up the 2gb of ram, xp will use the extra 1 gb?? 2.if i turn off paging files will my pc run faster? since no paging into the hard disk and all of the files are kept in the ram.would you suggest me to turn off paging files?? =) thnks in advance again ..

11530	10	281435	2690819	2690817	r. proffitt	1/28/08 6:28 am	1.20150168e12	the payoff past 1gb on xp is so slim...	that we can barely measure it. for instance a pair of desktops we used to render dvds gave me a good measure back then. we could move the ram from one to another and the one with 1gb would finish the 6 hour task 5 minutes sooner. for vista i think 2gb is the hot spot to be. you can try your own benchmark to see if going over 2gb helps but you will never find 4gb listed in any usable number since part of the 32-bit memory map must leave about .5 gb open for the video card, bios and such. you will find common reports of 2.75 to 3.5gb reported in the tools but even with the /3gb switch xp doesn't let the apps use more... bob
