(there are only 2 slots on the mother board) problem is that i'm not too sure what speed these ram sticks are...probably 133mhz but, how can i be sure before i go ahead and purchase the 2 new sticks???? is there a way to find out in the computer configuration? i don't have my original books either!!!!
