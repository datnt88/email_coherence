8415	4	3765	47072	47045	r. proffitt	11/24/03 5:31 pm	1.06969506e12	demo's yes. purchase is 2004 for me.	i have learned to bide my time on such things. i have already put aside any idea of upgrading any machines that we don't have to in anticipation of the changeover. i already see the price plummeting over the past month and xp-64 may not be what we'll be installing for these workstations. in the case of the next setups, it's open office and some development work in c++. since it will run windows 2000, we can do that with a dual boot to some linux-64. bob
