11384	3	140857	1580589	1580588	pksteven	12/4/05 11:46 pm	1.13373996e12	yes	okay, so i installed everything correctly, but i left something out: the power going from the power source to the video card.(( i turned the computer on, and when &lt;&lt;giving it power&gt;&gt; i got a screeching sound which sounded like it was coming from around my power source or processor.) this is where i figured you meant the vid card. do you have an old pc to try it in? i remember from last posts, you have nowhere to have it checked by liscensed tech so, all you can do is my above mentioned, a different pc perhaps. does the motherboard have onboard monitor port? i still feel you have bigger issues with the motherboard and in my opinion, it's not in good health. paul

11384	7	140857	1580677	1580627	pksteven	12/5/05 2:54 am	1.13375124e12	one more thing...	as before, it is going against my grain to even move on with this. in my opinion, something is beyond wrong here. the last thing i will attempt to ask you is, do you have an older pci or agp card to test in the machine? i read some specs on your mb and it will run an older agp just fine, according to the specs that is. that would be my very last suggestion to you since i think your motherboard is in trouble and as i suggested before, i wouldn't even try to start it. after this,i will bow out and leave it to someone else, but i can say, if another vid card won't work, it's trashed. either way, good luck. paul
