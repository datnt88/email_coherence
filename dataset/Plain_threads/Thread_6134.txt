9483	5	408674	3369312	3369207	r. proffitt	9/4/10 6:36 am	1.28358216e12	thanks for that.	at least you can give it a test before you decide. can i share an observation here? a few get upset over the lack of drivers as the years roll by. while i can explain why this is so what i want to write is this -&gt; many get so upset they write &quot;i'll never buy from them again.&quot; here's my observation. this issue is not limited to just a few makers. i've seen this happen with every product over the years from each maker. however i have had good luck with windows 7 xp mode where i use an old outdated no driver will ever be found usb microscope. this device has been very nice to capture pictures of stuff i need to document. it would be a shame to work that hard and for some there is that cost to upgrade to windows 7 pro or higher so vuescan is likely the cheap exit unless there is a new all in one that is cheaper than vuescan. bob

9483	7	408674	3369472	3369374	r. proffitt	9/4/10 11:20 am	1.2835992e12	about xp mode.	the cost of that is to upgrade to 7 pro. then you gain access to xp mode and those old softwares can run in xp mode. maybe that would be worth it? it takes a little learning to master it but i find it to be a great solution. bob
