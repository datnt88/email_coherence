6409	5	593658	5460376	5460385	r. proffitt	5/24/13 3:22 pm	1.36940892e12	as you change your questions, the answers change.	your top post lead with it being new. now it's not new but something else. it's pretty hard to diagnose as it is but when dealing with dead computers the common advice remains the same. if in warranty, use the warranty. if out of warranty you have to decide if you are going to be a pc repair tech. there are millions of posts about fixing a dead pc. basically you swap out the most suspect part. if you can't tell which part then you use the old advice of &quot;replace the cheapest part first.&quot; bob

6409	9	593658	5460757	5460464	cooforcer	5/25/13 2:33 pm	1.36949238e12	nop	when i was testing the compouter i wasnt even using a case, the mobo was on top of a anti static bag on top of a box, so that was not the issue.
