13227	6	298705	2796853	2796797	steven haninger	6/22/08 2:55 am	1.2141033e12	take a look here	google search i'd get the tx or txnm rather then the m type. nm means &quot;non-managed&quot; and m means managed. some of these managed types needed to have that feature shut off using a dos utility in order to prevent their bios interruption during boot up. these originally carried a price of well over 100 bucks each but you should be able to get one for less than 10. if you've got a local builder who does upgrades, i'm willing to bet these cards pass through his hands regularly. check with such a shop. i'd. the drivers are still on the 3com web site or easily available elsewhere. i'd say they should work with me but have no such experience. me was a later os and might even have the drivers built in. i was thinking 98se had the drivers as well and such is why i mentioned the upgrade. the cards will work with the first editions. the reason i suggested this was threefold. i had a lot of experience configuring these and found them better and more reliable than other brands of that era. many were made in the usa though some came from singapore and even ireland. they were sturdy. lastly, to me it makes good sense some times to use parts of similar vintage. though you can still buy hardware that &quot;works&quot; with win 98, i have to question just how much effort went into tuning that driver. such is why i recommended an older reliable card with an older os. good luck.
