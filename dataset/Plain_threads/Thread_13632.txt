(it might look on your screen as if the \/ is a &quot;v&quot; but it is actually a backslash and a forward slash next to each other) or you can add a space between the drives and the switches for the xcopy command if wanted for easier appearance and to avoid that v look, or even put them all immediately after the xcopy command followed by space and then the drives as such: xcopy /h/i/c/k/e/r/y/s c:\ d:\ after the copy is done, shut down, jumper the new drive to make it the master (or master with slave), and the old one the slave...if you plan on keeping it; otherwise, remove the old drive completely. then run fdisk from a boot disk, and make the new drive active. be sure you change the bios if you need to to match the new setup. it should then have a complete copy of your old drive, and act just like it. if you have more than one partition on your old drive and you have new partitions on the new harddrive, you can right drag and drop the old partitioned drive letters to the new ones and choose copy here...just make sure that each new partition is equal to or larger than the old partitions. toni
