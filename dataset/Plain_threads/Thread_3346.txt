10627	4	29790	339656	339120	leyo	7/19/04 3:18 pm	1.09025028e12	please stop answering like your teaching a nerd	i'll learn to fish, but it would help if you described the tools a little better. i'm signed in as &quot;someone&quot; yes. on my laptop i'm signed in as myself. that myself needs a password to get in. the desktop signs in automatically becuase there is only one account, no password. if that is what you were talking about, i pat myself on the back for understanding. and your article is also in nerd-ese. i know what a ping is, but i sure as anything dont know how to send one. and he isn't any clearer about that.
