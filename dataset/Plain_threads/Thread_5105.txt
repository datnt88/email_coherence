(this will break the raid 1 array) you will also want to make sure your hd selection is designed for raid operation. 3. i would restore the image to the new array. 4. i would attempt to boot the pc. with a little luck and cooperation from the imaging software, this should work since the array is considered as one drive. i have used this method to move an os on a single disk to a raid 1 array and it worked fine with xp. i've not gone from one raid configuration to another, however. your mb claims to support raid 0/1/5 and jbod. good luck.
