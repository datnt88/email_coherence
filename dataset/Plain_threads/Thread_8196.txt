4549	4	96939	1107700	1107309	art	4/7/05 8:10 pm	1.1129046e12	from what i gether...	you can't tell the difference by looking at the connector, so i guess your best bet would be to consult the manual. it appears that dvi comes in two favor (single link and dual link). single link is 18 pins and dual link is 24 pins. the dual link is the one that gives you the best graphic. if you are connecting the video card to a dvi port and not to a vga connection then it doesn't matter what you have. that's the best i can do..good searching!
