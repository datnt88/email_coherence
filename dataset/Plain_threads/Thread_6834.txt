14210	8	525128	5124153	5124149	zain_ua	4/29/11 2:30 pm	1.3040874e12	really?	sorry but as you might have figured by now, this is not exactly my field. what do you mean by &quot;average clone desktop&quot;. and why do you say that? i thought that this one would be fantastic with the huge ram and hdd, processor speed and the supossedly &quot;alright&quot; graphics card (according to some reviews i found) thanks again.
14210	9	525128	5124169	5124153	r. proffitt	4/29/11 3:00 pm	1.3040892e12	keeping it simple.	it's not a company with reviews by the usual sites (such as cnet) and is what you can find at mom and pop pc clone shops all over. yes, the parts are there but are you ready to figure out if they forget a driver or some other thing? for example many clone shops omit/forget intel's little rapid storage app and the owner suffers needlessly. such details are many but you see them all the time. the final choice is yours but i wouldn't buy that. if i was going to go down that road i'd copy what another member is doing at this link:  that's one nice selection. they picked the top from the people's choices. bob
