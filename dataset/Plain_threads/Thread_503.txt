(enough). i added the printer as a network printer to the win xp machine, and printed a test page. wow, that went well! i tried to &quot;add printer&quot; on the pentium 4 win 98 box. :.-&lt; &quot;browse for network printer&quot; will not find the printer connected to the vista box. i can't guess a path to the printer that works from the 98 box. in xp shared printer is ok, in 98 &quot;add printer&quot; can't find shared printer, printer works well locally in vista. how do i use vista printer from win 98 computer? thanks! b
