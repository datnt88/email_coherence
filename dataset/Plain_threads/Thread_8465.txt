(folder lock is a very good utility to purchase.)  i try to make it a habit to run my security tools on drive c:and shut down my internet service before i open any off the other drives. when i run ad-aware, nortons antivirus, microsoft windows malicious software removal tool, all off them checks all drives. go get that extra drive: good luck wendell h
