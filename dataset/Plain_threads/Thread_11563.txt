[however it really doesn't transfer anywhere near that fast in real life. lol]. this is a great mobo now that msi finally got a bios version that works. the mobo went through terrible growing pains right after anandtech praised it to the skies. i had bought one and after reading of all the problems sent it back unopened and got the gigabyte.
