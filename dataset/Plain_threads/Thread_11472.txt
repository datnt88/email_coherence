1845	0	45929	543649	nr	braindead	11/15/04 12:00 pm	1.10052e12	need help remembering how to install another hard drive	my computer was dropped and the frame bent. a friend gave me his, older one, until i can fix mine. here's the prob: his computer's hard drive has some sort of virus or spyware prob that is causing rundll32 and explorer ipf errors and i simply can't think any more to resolve. i used to know much more about puters, but have suffered brain injury which cause difficulties so....i need help remembering...step-by-step...how to install my hard drive into his computer. his hard drive has win98se on it, but mine has winxp. can i somehow keep both hard drives? that would be preferable as i would then re-format his to clean up the prob. if not, then i'll just pull his and replace it with mine. so...help please, with easy, step-by-step directions? thank you
