2012	3	11138	128422	127790	gakada	2/9/04 8:49 am	1.07631654e12	thank you all for the information..	it help me decide what to get in this case, i'll try the 'wap55ag' for now i can ignore the individual who use airsnort etc. i have more concern about the people within range, without tools like airsnort etc. do they be able to access my pc and/or use my cable internet connection? note: on my laptop, when i enable wireless connection, it will detect 2 (sometimes 3) available connection, but when i connect to one of them, i can not use it (can not do or see anything, such as browsing the internet or seeing their pc etc. .. it just say connected with the signal strength bar) is that a default setting for wireless connection or they have some special protection? i think i have to try it to know better... before asking to many question so i'll be back in couple of weeks with a new question. anyway thanks again...

2012	6	11138	130090	130048	r. proffitt	2/10/04 11:48 am	1.07641368e12	are you kidding?	just checking. your response is a little odd. i offered my best advice and you either didn't understand it or just don't want it. as to warjacking, it could get a neighbor upset if you cost them time or money, so changing the wap's rf channel is a great idea. or am i mis-reading you? bob
2012	7	11138	130748	130090	gakada	2/10/04 8:38 pm	1.07644548e12	i guess its a misunderstanding.. please apologized	in my confusion and worrying on planning of using wifi, i might said something odd.. i know you gave me a good advices and tips ... that is why i welcome you to my home. and i'm not kidding about the connection and wifi user in my country... that is why my first concern is to get my wifi lan connection works, then setting the security. anyway please apologize for my mistake and misunderstanding, if there is still any... thanks again for your reminder on the important of security.

2012	9	11138	131276	131033	gakada	2/11/04 9:13 am	1.07649078e12	thank you bob...	about the wifi channel .. of course i'll change it if necessary.. i see 2 or more available hotspot, when i use and turn on the wifi on my friend new laptop, which i help him, a litle here and there, during installation and setting. as for me.. i didn't have wifi capable device or wifi access point ... i'll get it in the next couple of weeks. thank you for your help and understanding...
