13923	3	60886	723328	722641	oil_tan	1/29/05 3:18 am	1.10696868e12	go to	wal mart. get the memorex 25 pack colorful 8x dvd blanks. they are actually ritek, i have burned over 150 and not one bad disc. if you get a chance and are familiar with dos, check for firmware updates, not driver updates. if not sure read up and prepare yourself so you can do a firmware update with no problems. good link for info....
13923	4	60886	723339	722641	oil_tan	1/29/05 3:24 am	1.10696904e12	also	install the burner as master on secondary ide channel. and do set jumper.
