(type msconfig in &quot;run&quot; and then click the start-up tab. download ccleaner (free from download.com) and delete invalid registry keys. its safe to delete keys using this program because it only scans for invalid keys and gives you a list of registry keys that are safe to delete. check your cpu and ram usage in the task manager under preformance during normal tasks. if the cup or ram is almost always being 100% used there might be a hardware problem. open up your computer's case and remove as much dust as you can. dust can cause slow downs and even overheating by acting like a blanket on your motherboard. i hope some of these make your computer run faster. i also wouldnt recomend a beta os because a newer beta will come out later or the official os will be out and you will have to upgrade again. i would stick to windows xp for now
