11523	5	56946	704580	704290	rub	1/21/05 10:03 pm	1.10634498e12	i would have liked to	but i looked at the possiblity of tracing the different ones and got nowhere. i get cool web search constantly. search assistant took over my home page 3 or 4 times. trend gave 30 notices of dial tibs a and instructions for downloading the fix, which wasn't an .exe and wasn't recognized by the anti-virus pattern file. i got many other repeats characterized as critical, which were quarantined, apparently before corrupting much. so far, the worst symptom is erratic browsing and ie6 freeze followed by shut-down and send error message, like ms is going to do something heroic and cut off the monster's head. i refuse to be paranoid about surfing; i go where i please and when i get a trojan ( regularly ), the last 3 urls get put in adaware ( i've got a bunch in there ). yeah, the overhead is excessive but since i'm retired, i look at it as a game of sorts. i figure if none of the major players in anti-virus can block this stuff but they seem to be able to contain the worst threats, i'll see how it goes. since i do have several backups for everything i'm concerned about, and haven't lost any files i care about for a couple of years, the worst-case scenario is putting in a formatted c drive, re-installing xp pro, transferring my backed up documents and settings, favorites and desktop, and reinstalling some of the apps that like to clutter up the registry, but that i prefer not to do without. at least i'm learning about the guts.
