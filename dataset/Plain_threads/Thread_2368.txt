(a few second or so) any web cam (even regular video camera, provided that you have a video input/output jack in your pc) and msn, yahoo or other instant messages software can be use ... why don't you try to use it now and start video chat with your friend or family ..

(a clip-on mic for the priest/officiator would be great.) i assume the ceremony will be also be taped on a real camcorder since it will be far better than anything from a web cam.
