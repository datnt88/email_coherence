(1.6ghz atom, with 1gb ram, xp home) but i realise things like chipset efficiency, board architecture and memory speed have moved on - so will it be a lot quicker than my ageing vaio? and would it be happy running office 2007? i've no intention of using it for gaming - it's purely for web browsing, e-mail and document creating/reading, with occasional use with sound forge. the light weight, good battery life and small screen are important to me, but i don't want to waste money buying something that'll be nearly as slow as what it's replacing! the reviews all say that, generally, netbooks won't deliver &quot;blistering performance&quot; but do they mean that issues like slow windows boot-up and annoying delays to open various apps will make it little or no better than what i'm replacing? to put it another way, should i really bite on the bullet and buy something much more expensive, i.e. an ultra-portable laptop as opposed to a netbook?
