12022	5	519299	5093881	5093847	r. proffitt	3/5/11 6:30 am	1.2993066e12	i'll comment on that.	&quot;lexar did say i should have formatted the card in the camcorder before use. but i've never had to do that before... card comes formatted so i just thought it was ok to use that way. not sure i understand why a card must be formatted in the camera before use.&quot; that advice is well known and accepted as correct. while using the card without doing so works fine in what must be 99.9% of the time, it's that last 0.1% that can cause folk grief. to explain why takes me about 5 minutes to cover entirely one on one over coffee so i'm keep it short to &quot;it's good advice.&quot; bob
12022	6	519299	5093947	5093847	steven haninger	3/5/11 8:45 am	1.2993147e12	i agree with the suggestion but i do wish this advice	was included in device instructions. so many flash and external drives come formatted and with software on them but i'll tend to pull off anything i want to save and format the device myself. years ago, 3.5&quot; floppy disks came un-formatted or, for a higher price, pre-formatted. i can't tell you how many of those pre-formatted disks i found to give read/write or track 0 errors immediately. i tended to always format these in the drive on the machine i would want to use them with. it should not have mattered in an ideal world but seemed like a good idea. what you might do when and if you get a replacement is to format it one of the devices that must write to or read from it and then test it with something that's expendable or already backed up. good luck.

12022	8	519299	5093990	5093952	steven haninger	3/5/11 10:12 am	1.29931992e12	should be usable in either but do test it	and make sure it works in your reader as well. there are a number of memory cards out there designed for various purposes and with costs to match these. though some manuals might not be user friendly, they should still be the best resource for determining what type of memory media you should use.
