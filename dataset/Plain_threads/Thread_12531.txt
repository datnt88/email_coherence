(seems silly, why wouldn't it come that way???) but in any case, my bios had no such setting switch, unless i missed it, but i looked at every menu. one configuration page showed as &quot;esata not-detected&quot;, but there was nothing there to be modified. what else can i check or do? (keep it simple, non-techie) i hate calling mfr support, so hoping you experts can spare me that grief. -wendy

(moral of the story: try out all ports and features within warranty period!) i couldn't get them to admit it was a known problem or anything along those lines, but they assured me that would fix the problem. one of the times while i was holding for a long time (and anticipating that they might blame it on the hard drive itself), i discovered that my laptop had an esata port. so i quickly tried it out there and it worked perfectly. it was plug and play. that kinda narrowed the options.
