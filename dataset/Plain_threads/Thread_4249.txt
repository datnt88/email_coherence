7371	2	62768	744807	744774	mark3316	2/6/05 11:28 am	1.10768928e12	sorry -- i'm not that smart	thanks for the reply. i'm afraid that i need more help: 1 -- router has latest firmware 2 -- i don't understand this one: what are they and i do i try it without them? 3 -- no: i don't have another router to try. 4 -- correct, per spybot a&d and hijack this!. thanks, mark

7371	4	62768	1051825	744681	gagco	3/17/05 7:32 pm	1.11108792e12	just got off the phone with hp tech support.	hi mark3316, i just purchased a compaq r3000z laptop with the built in broadcom wireless. i received it yesterday and have been having the same issue. i spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support tonight. we went thru all the normal things with no luck. the tech put me on hold for about 10 minutes. when he returned, he told me that this is a known bug with the built in broadcom wireless and windows xp sp2. do you have sp2 installed? mine came with it pre-installed. unfortunatly, the tech could not find the 'patch' he wanted. we tried one but it did not help. he's going to do more research and call me tomorrow around 4pm eastern us time. i'll post the results in case they help you.
7371	5	62768	1052384	1051825	r. proffitt	3/18/05 4:40 am	1.1111208e12	what bug?	i just so happen to have 2 r3000's with the broadcom cards and ... sp2. it works just dandy everywhere i go. very odd. bob
7371	6	62768	1052959	1052384	gagco	3/18/05 7:55 am	1.1111325e12	i know what you mean.	this is my second r3000. i bought one about 6 months ago and then a new one 2 days ago. from what i can see in the system information (sandra), it looks like the broadcom chips are different. the first r3000 has worked perfectly since i got it. i'm expecting a call from hp tech support around 4pm today, so we'll see if the tech knows what's talking about. i was suspecting a bad wireless card until i found the posting from mike and talked to tech support. i'll keep you informed.

7371	8	62768	1054934	1054913	r. proffitt	3/18/05 8:11 pm	1.11117666e12	what that does is disable the dep feature.	i've heard of such an issue, but in every case it shows faults in the driver code for the product and not a flaw in xp. i agree that its a valid fix till new drivers arrive. bob
7371	9	62768	1059196	1054934	gagco	3/20/05 5:26 pm	1.11133956e12	makes sense	i wouldn't be surprised if it was the driver. at one point the tech had me load the newest driver he could find which was dated march 16th,2005. it didn't help, but it certainly indicates that they are upgrading the drivers. thanks for your help bob. jim
7371	10	62768	1060877	1054913	isisdave	3/21/05 11:57 am	1.11140622e12	could you give complete details?	hi : could you tell us exactly which boot.ini file, and does that go on a line by itself or at the end of some other line? i have a new r3430us with xp sp2 and it can see the neighbor's linsys router but not my netgear one... dave
7371	11	62768	1061045	1060877	gagco	3/21/05 12:56 pm	1.11140976e12	details	hi dave, i don't have the details with me right now, but i'll try and post them later. i can say that the parameter is on a pre-existing line that specifies the operating system also. the symptom i saw was that the tcpip service kept stopping and restarting. i could always see my router. i just could not stay connected to it. sounds like your problem may be different. is your router set to broadcast it's ssid? i found hp's support to be very good. this was the first time i used them, but they didn't give me the run around and got to the problem. i had to have them call me back because they couldn't find the solution right away, but they did have something within one day. jim
7371	12	62768	1061097	1061045	isisdave	3/21/05 1:13 pm	1.11141078e12	probably is different	my problem probably is different: my new r3240us can see the ssid from my neighbor's linksys router, but not the one from my own netgear wgt634u, which i know is working with another notebook with a netgear wireless card. hp did answer within an hour, but only to suggest i check the router to be sure it is compatible with the broadcom b/g card in the notebook, which of course it is. i thought if your fix was easy, i'd try it.
7371	13	62768	1064035	1054913	mark3316	3/22/05 4:40 pm	1.1115096e12	update, more info, and thank yous	gagco, thanks for the information. the folks i got hold of at hp tech support were obviously heading down the driver path, but when i told them that i [at that time] had the newest drivers, they lapsed into &quot;well, then it isn't our problem&quot; mode. my wife currently has the laptop and she is off giving presentations at a couple of seminars. she informs me that at the seminar sites and hotels she has stayed at, she has stayed connected to the various wireless networks without problem. of course, at the seminar sites there has been a &quot;tech guy&quot; to get her connected, so i don't know what setup they are using. rproffitt, i'm sure that people whose occupation involves servicing networks have spare routers they can swap in. since i don't do that for a living, i can't see going out and buying extra hardware to use as a test bench. it is hard for me to believe that many people would have &quot;spare&quot; routers, wireless cards, or whatever if they are just trying to get a home network set up, and i assume that from my posts you didn't mistake me for a network administrator or it professional, so i am puzzled by the assumptions you seem to be making, and the unexplained jargon you use, in your posts. regarding your first response to my original post, i did have wep, wap, etc turned off.
7371	14	62768	1192287	1064035	rvalentine	5/16/05 6:14 pm	1.11626724e12	a solution	hi, i had exactly the same problems, due to sp2. what's strange is that the problem only manifested itself on certain routers. ok anyway, the solution was to go to my network places, and on the left click &quot;hide icons for networked upnp devices&quot;. there is probably another way to disable this constant searching, but using the common task pane worked for me. hope it helps someone.
7371	15	62768	1192337	1192287	rvalentine	5/16/05 6:51 pm	1.11626946e12	solution part 2	also had to switch my router (by visiting 192.168.0.1 in the browser) to use the correct channel. my previous laptop wireless card was intelligent enough to switch/scan channels. this one kept reverting to 11 when the router was set to 10.
