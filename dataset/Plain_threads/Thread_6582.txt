14696	5	179624	1975338	1970508	vapcmd	5/31/06 7:46 pm	1.14910476e12	if you're going to buy the laptop when it goes off lease .	and you want to use it thereafter and beyond ... add more ram (say 1 gb) now and enjoy it. and if you can wait 'til january 07 for the new system ... you could get a dual core 64 bit cpu and windows vista..the ms 64 bit os. by then there's a good chance adobe will have a 64 bit ver of photoshop too. and you won't need to spend $3k to get a well configured, robust, high performance system unless you go to the bleeding edge with the latest and greatest.
