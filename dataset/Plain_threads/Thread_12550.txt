4787	5	551814	5253463	5253435	dbardoul	12/30/11 1:00 pm	1.32525e12	i already have the accessories...	vapcmd, i just posted photobucket links to the adapters i already have that came with it. i just don't think the adapter will work properly with the card reader i have. the adapter doesnt canter the card reader in the bay so it lines up with the grill cut-out part.
