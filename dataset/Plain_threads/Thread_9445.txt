(there are so many types of connectors and adaptors and cables and splitters) cables to go dot com (not sure how it is spelled) is an example of a bunch of cables. if i were you i would just buy two identical surge protectors (a.k.a. &quot;sps&quot;) and now i am confused about how this is all going to be connected. i guess i could draw a map of what i think something like this would look like, but i won't.
