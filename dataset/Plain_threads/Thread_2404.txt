(boot windows 2000 from other than c: and without requiring c: to be available.) if so, how do they do it?

8108	10	17504	192856	192368	willy	3/29/04 12:45 pm	1.0805643e12	re:re:2nd reply..	in reference to vms world, if i remember right it would boot the #1 drive id'ed as such. you could re-id drive 1 by relocating the plug to another drive, thus it became a bootable provided it was bootable besides being mountable. as for the windoze world it just doesn't work that way in the os. there is or was a h/w fix in which you had drives physically mounted and in effect, swapped the id for drive c via a switch, so if you had 3 drives, toggle the h/w switches you could swap drives that way. but, since you're looking for a cheap cure, i thought you'll find the cost acceptable provided it is available still. further, sinc you have a compaq system as noted you have the bios offering a limited boot sequence. basically, to go further you need a custom bios to offer anything that's now available to newer mtrbds. but it will still look for drive c as it is physically attached via the hd cable. new bios boot paths are either a hd, usb device, or cd and scsi devices. if you use scsi, you can swap a bootable hd as well as its id number, but it may try the 1st physical drive via hd cable to boot from then proceed to rest, again alot depends on the scsi hd controller in this respect. in no way is your fix an easy one and you throw linux in the mix, i offer no cure for it, i'm too hazy on that topic for a clear answer. good luck -----willy

'd' should be your hd1, second hard drive. so... try 'd' and see what happens. if you have two hard drives on an ide cable with the proper jumper for master and slave (or cable select) the bios will see both hard drives 'c' will be hd0 (master) and 'd' will be hd1 (slave). if the bios sees your cd drive as 'd' when you have two hard drives physically installed in the pc... they are not cabled or jumpered properly.

8108	13	17504	193694	193685	r. proffitt	3/30/04 2:43 am	1.08061458e12	&quot;can you boot your d: drive with your c: drive physically disconnected?&quot;	not all oses will work with such a change. windows 95 being one i tried that (by accident) and there is no known cure. maybe it would be a better idea if you entertained using a boot or os manager. then you can install many os and let the boot/os manager deal with the issues. your current machine is a compaq and you are limited to bios boot selection that compaq gives you or you may be limiting yourself by not contacting mrbios. as an embedded electronics designer, i know this design very well and have used various dos/windows as quick solutions. these pc based systems were made for general usage and as such, when you depart too far, the answer is not exactly what you may want. i noted that my newer (now dated) machine has a boot from device menu. it's a nifty feature so you don't have to change the bios to floppy/cd/other drives. compaq (now hp) is unlikely to implement this in consumer machines since the best/cheapest solution is to automate the entire deal so to reduce support and maintenance costs. best of luck, bob

(uninstall and re-install is one way, something like partition magic is another). then you can boot from c or d using that technique. my compaq ap-550 workstation has more flexibility in the bios/post including scsii and network booting. nice box and very cheap if you don't need high end cpu.
