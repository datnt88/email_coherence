5634	8	314896	2901866	2901837	guerito	11/6/08 8:13 pm	1.22600238e12	changes....	i don't get boot errors (file missing). i do get freezes in windows which means i have to restart. after restarting i still have no boot errors, no f1 or f2 options appear...clean boot. the freezes are sporadic. i can work with no problem for hours but the next time i turn on the machine, i get a freeze, no matter what app i am using, within 5 mins. i work nights what's your excuse for replying at 3.00am? thanx.

5634	10	314896	2901980	2901869	guerito	11/7/08 4:27 am	1.22603202e12	i think...	i have a feeling it's either cpu or mobo related because of this... i built the system a year ago, all brand new gear. i swapped out my amd 64 3800 for a 3700 cos my brother's mobo wouldn't accept the 3700. i used heatsink paste when installing cpu. machine worked fine until about 6-8 weeks ago when cmos began acting up. seems the new battery has cured that. last week i installed a geforce 9800gt gr. card so i could start gaming again, i hadn't played a game for ages cos of lack of gr. power, i used onboard gr. before the geforce. games i used to play on lower spec machines are choppy and the freeze occurs. so i've got a new heatsink and am waiting for a new 3800 to arrive. if problems still persist then it seems a new mobo is in order.
