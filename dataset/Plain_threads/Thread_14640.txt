7938	4	243313	2461644	2461620	willy	4/16/07 1:32 pm	1.17673032e12	kiss - i try	as i stated to robert, the cheap units seemed to have flooded the market. all you have are the specs found on the labels to go by. i rarely ever meant a user that stated they researched(beforehand) to get the psu they needed. further, i haven't found too many recalls or x-brand being at fault openly. yes, tomshardware does some testing, but there are so many out there. the user has already build system or if oem(i think are good), they went cheap, regardless of the good advise already given. i see these users later or at least within 3mos.. i understand the rail side of things but explain that to a user and it seems to hit dead space. one reason, i try to impart at least buy a namebrand or really spent the $$$ and buy at pcpower&cooling. alot of people complain of oem psus being cheap but i find that not the case. they're simply build to supply what's &quot;needed&quot; and very little room to grow on for the product sold. the power issue comes up after x-years of use(wear&tear) or added devices plus the years of use. i find it hard to impress anyone on the simple psu side of things until it takes down the system. but hey, it pays for my services. -----willy

7938	8	243313	2462093	2461702	fred dunn	4/17/07 6:14 am	1.17679044e12	re:the stated power of a power supply is ac power????	the stated power of a power supply is not the dc power available, rather it is the maximum power that the supply will draw from the ac mains not considering reactive power factor. if i said &quot;the ac power of a power supply is the present total load on the dc rails divided by the efficiency&quot; then i stand corrected. it should have read the ac power consumed by a power supply (not considering reactive power factor) dc side ((vsum x isum)* 1/efficiency of conversion)) so if all of your rails are pulling 150 watts and your conversion efficiency is 70% then your ac power draw is 150 * (*1/.7) or 150 * 1.43 or 214.5 watts. if your efficiency is 80% then your ac draw is 187.5 watts. thanks for correcting me.
