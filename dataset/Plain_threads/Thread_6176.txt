3640	6	311663	2879200	2878468	in-correct	10/10/08 9:10 pm	1.223673e12	thank you:	it has 9.2 and i might upgrade to a more recent version someday, or perhaps i will get an additional machine, probably a notebook because too many desktops take up more space, and install os x on something whenever needed....because like i said i haven't used a mac for years and even on an older os i am still having lots of fun on it!! just wondering how does the heatsink stay on anyways?? is it electromagnetic?? because if there is supposed to be that slimey cooling gel or whatever that stuff is between a processor and heatsink, that stuff is not present.

3640	9	311663	2880048	2879852	mrmacfixit	10/12/08 6:06 am	1.22379156e12	heatsink	you already have the heat sink, you just need the clip and some thermal paste. the paste you can get from radio shack and you may be able to get a clip from your local computer repair shop. they are pretty generic. after you get the high speed internet, don't forget the router p
