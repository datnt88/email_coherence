10774	3	259530	2558332	2558033	willy	8/7/07 8:34 pm	1.18651884e12	well...	then remove the cmos battery for 10min. and then replace it and go from there. again, while you're doing that, install new battery. if the problem persists, use the &quot;clearing cmos pins&quot; to go to basics. if you boot-up then even with an error, do so. then reboot, enter the bios and correct for proper setting. checksum is a sign something has changed and doesn't match what was saved in the last correct bios post. if you're using a usb kybd. take it out, repeat the above steps with a plain ps/2 kybd.. if that corrects it, then return usb kybd. usage as last step. tada -----willy
