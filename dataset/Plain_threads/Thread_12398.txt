(i know that's out of the printer's spec range, but it's what i need anyhow). and the ricoh didn't even compare. i'm realizing that having access to a xerox docucolor 240 at the office has completely spolied my prining expectations. so if anyone knows a printer that prints just as well at a tenth of the price ... that's what i'm looking for. if you have any new information, please share! it seems that most reviews and even the sales folks do not understand our needs are different from most offices. everyone tries to impress me with print speeds, processing time, and how much paper the trays can hold. i care about everything but that... graphics print quality, font handling and paper handling such as truly heavy card stock and custom paper sizes.

(this was quite a while ago, so i'm really hoping that technology has caught up). anyone have feedback on the ink life and does the ink spread or smear at all?

(anyone who knows what settings to change are welcome to chime in here!!) i've been working around that with trial and error, but hoping to find the correct settings to get them to match more closely so i don't have to waste paper. other than that, i am a happy camper. good luck with your printer searches!!
7074	54	273212	2783823	2729334	ccaputo7	5/30/08 11:59 am	1.21214874e12	8560 review & color fixes	i too recently got the 8560dn - duplexer is great for wedding programs! there are a lot of great things, some bad. feeds envelopes great, but if you print on stardream envelopes, it will smudge/rub off when mailed. not sure about regular envelopes. but, it prints stardream cover stock great (105#) from the manual feed tray. as someone noted below, it doesn't print borderless, so you need to trim to do your bleeds. my large papercutter has a peice that holds the paper in place - but the pressure of it will offset the ink from one page to the next. so, i tediously have to put scrap sheets between each one before cutting. ugh! it doesn't always print in the right spot - for instance, i'll put my crop marks at 1&quot; and the design is dead on in illustrator, but will print 1/8&quot; off on the page, which can make this off center when cut. i manually move everything in my artwork before printing. as for color matching, it's great. it has built-in pantone matching - but don't compare to a real pantone book. there is a download from xerox that you print out - about 20 pages worth. it will print all the different color combos. (when you create your new documents, you need it to be set to rgb, not cmyk...and for the color mgmt to be set to let the printer decide on postscript colors, not illustrator and to use pantone solid coated even though you may be using uncoated paper). i have my pages that i use to choose what colors and it's dead on. great resource so you don't waste time playing with as many test prints. i now have three printers - the 8560, the 6180 so i can print laser on envelopes and an inkjet. my tiny office looks ridiculous!

7074	62	273212	2787972	2784901	czyadgrl	6/6/08 8:20 am	1.2127404e12	2nd side ink flaking on xerox 8560	everyone's talking about duplexing on the 8560, i'm trying mine out, and the ink keeps flaking off the newly-printed side on any print quality setting. it is slightly reduced by using the &quot;normal&quot; setting, but that doesn't give me good ink coverage or photo color. i'm trying to print double-sided on the stardream card stock. i've tried putting the setting on &quot;2nd side&quot; as well, but no real change. anyone had this happen?
7074	63	273212	2790999	2787972	ccaputo7	6/11/08 6:37 pm	1.21320942e12	xerox 8560 flaking? jamming?	i have not had the issue of the 2nd side flaking. i just finished a job doing double sided programs - using black only, and mostly text. the problem i ran into was this. after printing 130 sheets double sided of stardream cardstock, it started to jam. it would print the first side fine, and when it pulled it back in, it jammed. i let it cool a bit (was worried i was working it too hard) and then switched to printing on my stardream text stock which was the inner piece. it printed 170 of those double sided no problem but when i went to do the cardstock again, it kept jamming. although since it doesn't print both sides at the same time, it's just as easy to put it through the printer twice... did you get your envelopes to work? was that you?
7074	64	273212	2791262	2790999	czyadgrl	6/12/08 7:10 am	1.2132546e12	xerox 8560 flaking? jamming?	hello! more insight to my 2nd side flaking problem - it happens only when there is a photo on one side of the page, and only the photo area flakes. back-to-back text comes out just fine. i too have noticed the jamming after printing lots of pages of the stardream cardstock (from the manual feed tray though). in my case, the printer picks up several (!!!) pages at one time and they get stuck part way in. my hunch is that it's the texture of the paper, combined with the power of the feeder r and the manual feed tray pushing itself a little higher as the stack of paper goes down. i also notice it more on some paper colors than others. another question - getting light shades of yellow seems tricky, as there's always other colors printing with the yellow, even with 100% y value in my artwork. i tried going the rgb route, but it di d not change the output.

7074	71	273212	2832438	2832391	czyadgrl	8/12/08 12:32 pm	1.21854432e12	flaking and powering itself on	i have both of these problems! flakey ink, on certain metallic papers more than others.. and, the waking itself up all the time is really annoying. i'm still not certain this printer is the solution to my invitations. the next step, from what i can see, is a much more expensive printer, as i've had 3 other xerox's that didn't work out, even up to $1400 range. on top of that, i'm not pleased with the service xerox provides on the phasers. you get delegated to &quot;the phaser department&quot;, which is not open evenings or weekends (which of course, are the only times the printer has problems!). they also take a full day to get their local techs to call and schedule an appointment. so far, the techs out have not solved any problems without creating more. and when you call and get through to the phaser support people, they run through the simplest and most obvious things that i've usually already done to try and fix the problem myself.

(like i said this is only on the metallics.) try this and tell me if yours does this: print something on the metallic stock and cut through the ink with an x-acto knife - like you were cutting out an invite with a full bleed. does the ink kind of ball up on the knife where you cut and you have to wipe it off? maybe it is just my machine! it is not super noticeable, but not perfection either.

(good thing because it is pretty expensive...) however note that the 6360 is a great printer for a small to medium size office with a number of employees, it is just not what we all need for an invitation business. i guess we'll keep looking...
