10130	1	55378	660332	659856	r. proffitt	1/6/05 5:41 am	1.10499006e12	such drove a cnet forum member nuts. here's why.	they had connected the drive to usb 1.1 ports and the usb case only worked fully on usb 2.0 ports. another forum member had moved a drive with data into the usb case and the contents vanished. put it back in a pc and there it was again. lesson? you must prepare said drive in the usb case. use the disk management tool. bob
