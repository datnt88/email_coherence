10840	5	116857	1328441	1327921	angryfirelord	7/29/05 5:19 am	1.12261434e12	it's fine	the psu is good enough because m-atx boards don't consume a lot of power. sata 150 is definately supported but you may be thinking of sata 300. that i don't know, maybe not. everything seems to be compatable except maybe the video card and chipset. now i maybe wrong, but i don't know if mixing ati nvidia is ok. also, your card is a two slotter. try this:  hope this helps!
