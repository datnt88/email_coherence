7502	3	534856	5171996	5171670	steven haninger	7/23/11 4:11 am	1.31139426e12	well, you did forget the monitor	make, model, type, etc. lcd or crt?..and by scanlines do you mean some sort of vertical or diagonal thin traces that are there constantly or are they changing? my first thought is to try the monitor on another machine if possible and/or check your pc with another monitor. this considerably narrows the possibilities. you rule in or out what's the easiest to do. you can also see if the anomaly exists while running in safe mode. if you still have the scan lines in safe mode, it's more likely the monitor or display card. if not, you start looking at the driver, some setting, or the monitor's failure to respond to it properly.

7502	6	534856	5172334	5172300	steven haninger	7/23/11 4:01 pm	1.31143686e12	sorry, i mistook your reply as the pc's hardware	ok, here's what i'd do to rule out the os. can you download some &quot;live linux&quot; iso or even some utility iso and burn to cd. see if the lines are still there. if they are, it's not windows. you're left with the display card or the monitor or cable. if the cable is detachable, you can try another or just reseat things. i suspect you have. you're going to run out of options if you cannot try another monitor or plug this one into another pc but, if it came down to only the video display device or monitor, my guess would be the monitor has the problem.

7502	9	534856	5173633	5172931	compucles	7/25/11 2:08 pm	1.31160288e12	never mind	it's still under warentee, so we're just going to send it in to get fixed.
