(i hope the link works) also, the extra hard drive. i want to go internal because it's cheaper... will newegg have what i need??? any suggestions? for the dvd burner... i understand the different formats but there are still too many to choose from... i want to go interal here too (unless there's a cheap external burner (doubt it). doing this will cause me to have to remove my current cd burner (lack of space) does anyone see a problem with this? anyhow, it looks like i need 3 pieces of hardware and i need it as affordable as possible. i've bought from newegg.com before and i'd like to buy it all there if possible??? thanks! brent

1377	2	95335	1079919	1079862	3luke3	3/28/05 9:28 pm	1.11204528e12	hmmm	that seams like a great deal for the burner... but only get a dual layer drive if you think you'll need to burn dual layer discs (almost 100% of american home dvd players don't play dual layer) & you can get a single layer drive cheaper i think. i just got a 120gig wd hard drive at best buy for $60 after rebate. don't think it was sata though... so if you know the diff... research & see what you need/want.
