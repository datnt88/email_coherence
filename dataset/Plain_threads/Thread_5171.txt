(yesterday, had to re-boot 4 or 5 times before it became stable.) i have the mb and power pack part numbers from compaq. how can i try to be sure what i have to replace before ordering new parts? note: there was no visible sign of bad capacitors. power pack fan and cpu fan seem to be working fine. (to repeat: i run win98se with all updates; on a compaq presario 5838 (500 mhz amd athlon cpu); 384 megs ram; compaq 2 button wheel mouse; logitech mouseware control center version 9.00.99; mouse driver version 9.00; internet explorer 6.0 + all updates; norton anti-virus 2000 with all latest virus updates (it has passed all virus scans including the latest update); network neighborhood enabled.)

(i have not turned off this pc since yesterday morning). so as i look for bad components, what kind would exhibit the &quot;bad when cool - good when warm&quot; characteristic? ps - i ran all the &quot;checker&quot; stuff you referred me to. no problems detected.

(you don't want to know.)	all the parts can lead to this issue. well, maybe not the speaker, some indicator leds and a case (but maybe?) i mentioned the age of the parts are working very much against us here. electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies, motherboards and almost all parts of the pc age and decrease in capacity at an astonding rate. chips can exhibit such anomilies and there is no firm test to find which one in any economical manner except to swap out a board/cpu/chip and see if the issue vanishes. but since it does this with repeatability and you can use the machine, maybe all you need to do is to not spend a dime? just turn it on 10 minutes ahead of time, then reboot? bob ps. if you want some engineering documentation on electrolytic capacitor aging, then i can supply some, but it's mostly charts and jargon that shows the aging of time and temperature. what no-one really tells the consumers is that most machines will fail in some number of years or develop 'issues.'

(you don't want to know.)	thanks again. now i'll go off and &quot;ponder&quot; some more. i know its time to get a new pc but: 1) i don't relish the thought of the time required to &quot;learn&quot; win xp-pro. 2) i will have to buy an upgrade to my office suite, and probably spend some time learning it's anomalies (they all have them). i am hooked on wordperfect office suite - hate the thought of going to microsoft. 3} i'll have to re-enable my home network. this pc is now the hub. it was a pain to set it up once! 4} i'll have to buy an upgrade for drive image (and maybe for partition magic). all of the above takes much time. but considering all the time i have spent on the current pc issues, maybe i should have made the jump sooner! thanks again.
