(ask them to connect it to a laptop if necessary.) if you plan on watching movies, get them to play a dvd; if you do a lot of excel/word, open those applications; if you play games, fire up a quake4 demo. now do these same tests with a more expensive monitor (samsungs lcds are regarded as top notch) and decide if the differences are with the extra money.
