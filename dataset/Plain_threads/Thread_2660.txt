15075	7	189094	2053997	2053809	pksteven	7/8/06 12:08 am	1.15231728e12	go here...	or  or here  two of these are no longer being updated, everest home and mbm but both still work wonderfully. i don't know if speedfan is going out either , doesn't seem so. everest decided only to go with paid versions but the home version still works good for me. remember a couple of things, your motherboard has to support certain sensing ability, if it doesn't you won't get that particular sensor to show. also, these programs run off your motherboard sensors and the shown motherboard temps can be + or - depending on how accurate they are. paul

15075	11	189094	2055340	2055056	pksteven	7/8/06 7:04 pm	1.15238544e12	while i...	typically don't like to give opinions on products i haven't used, however, if comparable, go with 512. either way you cut it, it's better than 256. gs has same core but is a bit underclocked from the gt. but you may be better off to look at some specs...  hope this helps, paul
