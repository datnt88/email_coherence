4990	4	346695	3065636	3065410	steven haninger	6/21/09 5:32 am	1.24556232e12	servers have many uses	they can be used to store and retrieve files. a nas does that as it's basic function. they can be used to run programs from in a server/client environment which eliminates the need to install some programs on every pc on a network that will use them. they can be used to keep databases. there are web servers, proxy servers and the list goes on. your original question was about use of a nas. these generally run services but not applications. they work well as file servers but can have some limited ability to keep databases. it sounds as if you're looking for ways to start up pcs remotely. it would not require a server to do this. it would require the remote pcs to have certain hardware capabilities. you'd broadcast a wake up signal from any pc on the network. that signal would address the pcs you wanted to turn on but it would be by hardware address or &quot;mac&quot;. remote or timed shutdown can also be accomplished. hope that helps.

4990	6	346695	3066492	3065920	steven haninger	6/22/09 2:16 pm	1.24568016e12	mostly it's in the software	you purchase network server versions of the application and client licenses to run from terminals. these client licenses are generally packaged by a specific number of remote terminals/pcs that can access the application. a company might by a server version and 50 client licenses. i don't know how popular this is anymore but was useful with networks that used &quot;dumb&quot; terminals....types without hard drives, etc. as such, you cannot buy just any piece of software and run it from any other pc on the network as a workaround to buying more copies of the application.
