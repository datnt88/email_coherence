6306	2	326502	2959202	2959165	kingbandaid	1/21/09 8:10 pm	1.2325686e12	hmmm	well i also thought might have been a dead battery....replaced that with a brand new one....not sure if maybe bios is dead....i get all the right beeps as usual. vid card was mine from home, i was just using to see if the machine had happened to have been set to use that slot before. but no dice.

6306	9	326502	2971511	2960814	kingbandaid	2/4/09 7:17 pm	1.23377502e12	i'm backkkk!	ok so i gave up on that other one, i dunno quite know what is wrong out of the many things i spotted lol. broken seating for the cpu, heat sink cracked, motherboard has random scratches....anyway. i moved on to another older machine they had sitting around they thought was broken because it had something rattling around and it wouldn't stay on for more than like 60 seconds....once again i cleaned her out and reseated the heat sink(which was completely off, was rattling around) and now she is golden....the only problem is some tard decided to run xp on this poor machine with only 64mb of ram!!!! xd i laughed so hard... so long story short-i am getting prepared to reinstall probably just win2k and upgrade to 256m of ram. the only other issue i will have is that i cannot tell any evidence of a manufacturer on the mobo; probably a home-made knock off from malaysia or something, so i will not be able to find drivers... any ideas?
