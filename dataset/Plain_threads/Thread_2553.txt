5877	2	573617	5363297	5363293	padyboy	9/19/12 2:38 pm	1.34806548e12	reply	i have seen no information on the internet indicating i should &quot;junk&quot; this peripheral device. i am attempting to reuse this drive, not simply transcribe infirmation. there are many websites claiming to have the required drivers for this device. they state that it will work with windows xp, which i am using. i have used this usb 2.0 zip100 drive in the past with this computer. i see no reason why it should not function now, except for the &quot;planned obsolence&quot; i have read about regarding the home computer business. i should not be required to junk my older peripherals if this is indeed the case. i am now living on retirement income and cannot afford to keep up with the new products. i don't want to sound sarcastic, but as i try to rejuvenate my older hardware, i am encountering a dearth of infomation. as an aside, after downloading/running &quot;aro 2012&quot; from this website, my dell dmension 5150 computer is dead; it will not boot to windows xp: the floppy disk drive light remains lit, as though it is attempting to boot from this drive. the usual f keys on power on have no effect. this software screwed with my registry. i have read elsewhere that should to be avoided. i guess i may be too late, unless i can find some wnxp boot disks or resort to &quot;dban&quot; reformatting, which i was hoping to avoid. i would appreciate any positive input regarding my situation. must i write of this computer? it was functional before i began searching for iomega zip100 drivers.

5877	6	573617	5363375	5363324	padyboy	9/19/12 8:11 pm	1.34808546e12	reply	since my computer has already &quot;crashed&quot;, i must assume i will be using the floppy &quot;a&quot; drive since nothing else works at present. most solutions seem to require a functioning cd drive. fortunately, this is a refurbished unit for &quot;learning&quot; purposes and has nothing to lose, although i did make a data backup for some reason. i have an ms dos boot disk, and the 6 floppiy win xp setup disks, if required. most of the repair software seems to require a functioning cd drive, which i have not. due to my blunder, i am past that stage.i will never again run any program that touches my registry, although &quot;cc cleaner&quot; was reviewed by cnet. as it is past midnight here, i will start tomorrow, after checking back at this website for further advice. grats!.

5877	10	573617	5364166	5363324	padyboy	9/21/12 2:03 pm	1.34823618e12	reply	from your link, i found &quot;repair windows xp by repairing a repair install&quot; and &quot;xp repair install free&quot; which lead me to windows-fix.tuneup360.com&quot; and &quot;xp repair install -cam 2000&quot; could you be more specific on precisely which choice to make. i must download a program which i can use on my currently &quot;crashed&quot; computer. i must be able to boot from my floppy drive. i have an external floppy drive. i doubt if i can use this. internal floppy drives (refurbished) are cheap and easy to install, but will require a trip to a computer shop which sells one. in addition, i have found they are not generic. i am using an internal floppy purchased from dell because the &quot;generic&quot; drive i purchased locally does not have the data/power cable configuration which fits my computer. i would not mind the $20 expense, but cost of excursion must be considered. perhaps i can download the required software program and send it as an email attachment to the &quot;learning&quot; unit. i would still be able to boot the computer somehow, presumably from the a drive. i have &quot;setup&quot; diskettes (6). that is my next step. i have previously backed up the data from this computer, none of which is crucial, knowing i was just &quot;learning&quot;. thus i have nothing to lose here. i will await any further suggestions.
