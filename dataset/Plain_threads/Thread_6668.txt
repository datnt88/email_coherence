9600	5	193838	2097121	2093027	maggieboby	7/28/06 5:38 am	1.15406508e12	apple monitor, viewsonic pro series or samsung pro series	honestly, my first choice would be the apple monitors. sure, they're pricey, but they are great! two of the three choices of their monitors also work with windows-based pc's too (provided you have the right type of video card). if you want to choose something other than apple, then i would recommend viewsonic's pro series. there are 3 series that viewsonic puts out and there is a difference in how well they perform -- so pay attention to the little vx, va, etc. in front of the model numbers. va is the value series... vx is the pro series. they, too, are pricey, but well worth it if you are a pro graphics person. lastly, samsung makes a pro series as well... again the same notes apply as above. for the most part, the pro type series of monitors are not going to be available at most stores. so, i recommend starting at each manufacturers' web site to get the choices/specs, etc., and then do some comparitive shopping online. good luck! maggie b

9600	7	193838	2097484	2093027	wcoffey81	7/28/06 8:26 am	1.15407516e12	pro lcd.s	i don't sell these yet so don't think this is just spam. most/all phillips monitors have a three year warranty and some come with a &quot;perfect panel&quot; designation. it means just that, no dead pixels! plus a quick turn-around in case something does happen. they're not cheap but...... viewsonic would be my second choice but their huge list of part numbers make it difficult to find the exact product that you are looking for. i as a dealer can even get a little overwelmed with viewsonic. weeding through all of the offerings and then checking with different vendors to find my choice gets old. then having to do it all over in three weeks because that part # is no longer stocked. don't get me wrong they make a good product!!!
