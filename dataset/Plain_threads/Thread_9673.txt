4561	9	597983	5485166	5485157	padyboy	8/7/13 2:31 pm	1.37588586e12	cont'd	i will consign this nexxtag hub to use with my win xp computer, if i can get to work in this brave new world. meanwhile i think a belkin product would likely be the best choice, although they never compatibility wiyh win 7 os. thank you all for your input. &quot;let the buyer beware&quot;
