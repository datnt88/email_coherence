2145	2	167310	1851347	1851298	jsteinmetz	4/2/06 1:34 pm	1.14398484e12	sorry bout that	i am using a wireless router for my interenet connection to both computers which is unsecured.

2145	4	167310	1851391	1851369	jsteinmetz	4/2/06 2:17 pm	1.14398742e12	password	my router is password protected but the ssid is not &quot;protected&quot; is that ok?
2145	5	167310	1851444	1851391	michael geist	4/2/06 3:09 pm	1.14399054e12	your ssid broadcasting gets either....	turned on or off. i've found that mac filtering is usually enough in most home environments since many will trip over wep/wpa encryption.
2145	6	167310	1851399	1851444	jsteinmetz	4/2/06 3:24 pm	1.14399144e12	my ssid says	it is enabled wep is an open system and it says wep is disabled.
2145	7	167310	1851545	1851399	michael geist	4/2/06 4:39 pm	1.14399594e12	nothing more to add....	to what has been suggested. have you enabled mac filtering, this is the easiest and least troublesome of the security options in a router.
2145	8	167310	1852221	1851545	jsteinmetz	4/3/06 6:40 am	1.1440464e12	i am going to....	enable mac filtering now and see what happens. i am checking the button only allow computers with mac addresses listed below to access the network. it then lists my computers in the dhcp client drop down list so i'll see what happens. thank you.
