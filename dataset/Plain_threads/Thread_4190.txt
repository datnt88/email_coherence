2314	0	225279	2357082	nr	lisa_blakey	12/26/06 3:08 pm	1.16714568e12	i am buying a new computer. . .	and i want to take the files (i.e. music, pictures, word, games, etc) from the old computer and put them on new one. is that possible? if so, how do i go about doing it without bringing viruses for the old computer to the new one? i basically want all of my old information on the newer, faster machine. both computers are gateways, both desktops, both run on xp. i don't know what else you would need to know to solve this problem, so just ask i am basically upgrading as i have had the old one for over 4 years. oh and step by step directions (like you are telling your grandmother) would be great.
