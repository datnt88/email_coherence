1512	4	559800	5294338	5294053	kenny-s	4/2/12 10:22 pm	1.33340532e12	endless	so in short we are being mislead with false advertising such as these devices being able to perform when infact they dont ! all i am looking for is a sound device that allows me to share media files to other connected devices on my network, seems like i am fighting a loosing battle . the questions are so easy if you already know the answers ? if you never ask then how do we learn ? a fundemental learning curve ! can you offer any solutions to my issue ? would like to have this capacity on my network but now realise nas drives are not the answer. i am currently using a netgear dgnd3700 router but the ready share feature i am not to convinced with either ie; supporting a 2 tb external hard drive ?

1512	8	559800	5295033	5295011	r. proffitt	4/4/12 9:45 am	1.3335327e12	ps. i really should have had regular coffee.	even though what i use now has a long history of things that didn't work out (the old roku hd, some htpc, too many &quot;media players&quot;) i am looking to change this working system some day. i'm considering the sony google tv since it has a bd player. just want to test it. why? 1. the bd player. 2. it's 1080p versus the revue's 720p. the revue is working well but i wonder if it can be better. the boxee seems to get good reviews but i haven't tried it yet. and strange i haven't seen one in the stores here. bob
