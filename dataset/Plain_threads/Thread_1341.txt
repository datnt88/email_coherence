(i should explain, im living in france at the moment, but originally from the uk) quick phone call to my dad only to discover that in updating the home computer to windows 7, they decided i obviously didnt need my user account any more, cos i dont live with them at the moment, and besides i have everything i need on my external hard drive; so they deleted it triple crap. ok so now i really need to get this signature mini working! i look around online, and a few forums suggest checking the bios hmm, im not very computer-y minded so im not entirely sure how to change those, but as far as i can see its not that. reinstalling the drivers nope, that doesnt work either. if i try to reinstall from scratch i get a little popup saying installing device drivers, click here for status. the status scrolls for a little bit, installing installing still installing failed. quadruple.. well you get the idea by now. as a last ditch attempt i followed the advice of several hundred people online saying omg this really works, and put my hard drive (well wrapped) in the freezer. that was 5pm on sunday; it is now midday on monday and on getting my chilly hard drive out of the freezer i have found no change whatsoever. is there anything, absolutely anything, that can be done?? or am i just going to have to shell out on data recovery? i know that since my hard-drive is under a year old i can send it back to simpletech, but they dont do data recovery which is the vital part of my problem! sorry to blab on, guys, but i thought you should have as much detail as possible. please please help me
