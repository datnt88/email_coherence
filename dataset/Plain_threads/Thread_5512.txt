9548	3	101387	1164423	1164239	dnpate	5/1/05 1:12 pm	1.11495312e12	should be the a8v deluxe mb	as above but the question is the same. does the a8v deluxe mb work with the all in wonder 9800? thanks, david

9548	5	101387	1164501	1164423	islander	5/1/05 2:00 pm	1.114956e12	yes	works with  and radeon 9800 series of products requires connection to your pc's internal power supply for operation.
