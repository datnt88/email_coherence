7465	5	120346	1366995	1366744	dick white	8/17/05 5:25 pm	1.1242995e12	puppa...	the mac address is a unique serial number assigned to every network adapter of any type by its manufacturer. the ip address is the &quot;street address&quot; on the internet information highway that your connection must have in order for data packets to be delivered to the proper recipient under the rules of tcp/ip networking protocols. mac address filtering is when the owner of a wireless access point sets up a list of the mac numbers of wireless adapters that will be authorized to use the services of that access point. if the mac number of your wireless card is not on the list, that access point simply won't do any business with you. assignment of an ip address is something which a dhcp server will do whenever a system enters a tcp/ip network. your isp issues one to your cable modem when you turn it on. your router will issue one to your computer when it boots. but if the router is a secured wireless one, an unauthorized intruder will not be given an ip address and no data will be passed. the intruder will get that &quot;no ip address assigned&quot; message in their wireless client manager dialog. dw

7465	7	120346	1367191	1367036	dick white	8/17/05 7:25 pm	1.1243067e12	i have seen...	issues where the wireless adapter driver was installed incorrectly (bad file copy, munged registry entry, not necessarily anything you did wrong...) which were resolved by deleting the adapter in device manager with a reboot for xp to redetect it and reinstall the driver. all of sudden it worked the way it should. have you tried this system at another location and it worked there but not here? and yes, continue your conversation with the network tech guys. often if you show a sincere interest in learning yourself how this stuff works, they'll spend a little extra time and show you more about it rather than just clicking the right stuff they know about and giving it back to you with the &quot;here, idiot, it works now&quot; attitude. dw
