(for win xp at least!!). please note that i only use my pc for office type functions and don't do any gaming - so this approach may not work if you want to use all the funcionality of your graphics card - certainly for all the basic windows stuff it works just fine without the nvidia drivers!!! this problem appeared gradually - finally culminating in rapid on/off and flickering screens with distorted graphics and then the constant standby state of the monitor and on occasion bsod's. if you need any more background on how this problem manifested itself on my pc then let me know. hope this helps everyone! cheers eddie
