(answer in question form!) q. should i have a 3rd hdd for scratch track or partition the 2nd. a. see first answer. q. should i do a raid 0 with 2 320s or 250s. a. now that adds speed when you want to copy a big file. the only danger is that many don't backup and don't have tools to repair raid sets. also raid doesn't move well from machine to machine. if you will be using these hard disks to move to another machine i give the nod to &quot;no.&quot; bob
6602	2	259008	2557040	2554945	ozos	8/6/07 5:51 am	1.18637946e12	one thing i'd add...	larger hard-drives are generally faster hard-drives, for two reasons: a) larger hard-drives are usually newer hard-drives, which means they have newer (therefore, generally speaking, faster) technology b) larger hard-drives are denser (same physical size, more data inside it) which means they can maintain somewhat better access times and somewhat better burst transfer performance now, this doesn't mean that a 1000gb hard-drive is going to be 4 times as fast as a 250gb hard-drive, it means that a 1000gb hard-drive at 7200 rpm with 16mb of cache is going to be a few percent faster than a 250gb hard-drive at 7200 rpm with 16mb of cache, but its still a tad faster i would advise against having a smaller 80gb drive for the os (see a and b), and suggest a 4 or 5 disk array for the entire system, with 4 disks i would consider raid10 or raid0+1, with whatever size you like, if 5 or more, i would go raid5 helpful information on raid

6602	6	259008	2557764	2557730	ozos	8/7/07 5:31 am	1.18646466e12	i'd beg to differ	if i might interject, 10k rpm drives are fast becoming pointless to invest in, due to the lower latencies and increased performance of modern 7200 rpm drives, which have more than enough cache and optimizations to compete fairly with at least a few 10k rpm drives. if pure speed is the goal, 15k rpm u320 drives in raid5 is the only option, however such an arrangement is very noisy and expensive. additionally, a single platter is far from junk, as the re series have proven reliability and capability in many enterprise applications. there is nothing to say a single platter is any less capable than a multi-platter drive.
6602	7	259008	2557803	2557764	r. proffitt	8/7/07 6:24 am	1.18646784e12	still junk.	it's strictly a dollar play. when you can explain to me the physics of access times across a platter can approach change from one platter to the next during a read (it can't) then you may gain some credibility. i can see how the marketing of such can bamboozle the best of us. bob

6602	9	259008	2558078	2558076	r. proffitt	8/7/07 1:24 pm	1.18649304e12	sorry, are you telling me the heads have to go to	the second platter. once you discover what hole you just jumped into, email me if you want to retract that statement. i can make like &quot;it never happened.&quot; hint: the heads don't have to move at all, there is an electronic &quot;switch&quot; to read the second, third, fourth heads without one seek. bob

6602	11	259008	2558537	2557803	ozos	8/8/07 5:15 am	1.1865501e12	i'm not	trying to argue conceptual physics with you, i'm stating that a single platter hard-drive isn't more likely to break or be damaged, which the word &quot;junk&quot; would exemplify. the platter still has high density, equal to the larger drives, yet costs less due to having the single platter. additionally, the platter configuration doesn't matter a whole heap of a lot, especially in context of caviar re and re2, which are ideally in a multi-disk raid solution (which means whatever your ideal platter configuration, single drive, setup may be, its still going to be slower, and if its not, then its going to cost a load more).

6602	13	259008	2559274	2559097	ozos	8/9/07 6:44 am	1.18664184e12	the 250gb you're talking about	is an excellent drive, and should serve well, if you do decide to go raid later, its just fine for that, the re is just more optimized (but that doesn't mean you have to buy a raid edition drive).
