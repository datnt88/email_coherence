4554	9	390864	3288135	3288133	ac1818	4/17/10 5:21 am	1.27148166e12	yes	as this pc works with other hard drives using the same cables i would expect it to work. i am quite sure that my jumpers settings are correct. do you need an more details. thanks

4554	13	390864	3288168	3288148	ac1818	4/17/10 5:51 am	1.27148346e12	can't	don't have another channel. i have other sata connectors but not another ide one

4554	19	390864	3288181	3288125	steven haninger	4/17/10 6:06 am	1.27148436e12	jumpers	i don't know the model #s, size or age of your maxtor and wd drives but can tell you that i've never seen a specific jumper standard shared by all drive manufacturers or even between product lines from the same manufacturer. since you mentioned using a hd with a cd rom, i can tell you that this can often through a real monkey wrench into the works. be careful of &quot;master&quot; settings. some will allow that setting if only one drive is installed and some consider that the master jumper position means that a slave exists and you cannot use it with a single hd. what you need is the instructions from the manufacturer for each drive model to figure out their scheme. unfortunately the only experiences i've ever had with maxtor drives have been bad so i avoid them. i also avoid trying to mix drives from other manufacturers or even vintages. if one is older ide and one is called an eide, ultra ata, etc., i wouldn't mix them on the same cable. maybe if you know the hd model #s that might help dig up better information about what jumper settings are valid.

4554	21	390864	3289147	3288179	r. proffitt	4/19/10 5:33 am	1.27165518e12	ide cables are	pretty much a generic item. if you researched this you found 2 common models with 3 connectors and two ribbon cable types. if you use the older ribbon cable type the worst that could happen is the drive data is corrupted. the newer ribbon cable type can be used without issue except you have to set the jumpers and the drives must &quot;like&quot; each other. i covered the old tech stumper earlier about drives that never work on the same ide channel. this one has caused months of time lost for some techs. some can't wrap their head about that. bob
