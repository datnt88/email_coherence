8883	6	123099	1397752	1395579	g wright	9/2/05 5:51 am	1.12564026e12	no	if you get a new motherboard or processor windows does not have to be reinstalled only if you change the hard drive in your computer like get a new hard drive because on the information like the os and so on is on the hard drive. just changed a motherboard and a processor on a dell computer did not have to reinstall windows. make sure that the items if you do change them are the same make and speed as the old ones.
