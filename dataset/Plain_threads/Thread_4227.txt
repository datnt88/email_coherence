(i have the details if needed). i remove the old ram, and everything works fine, for about an hour. then my computer randomly reboots. i start t back up, and get the same thing. the only thing i figure culd be wrong is my vdd power voltage. i set it at 1.6 v, but everytime i start up, stats like the voltage and temps show up, and its red and only showing 1.3-&gt;1.45v. i dont know what the deal is. thinking this problem was with windows and the software, i decide to restore my computer. after backing up and everything, i put all of the ram in and begin the process. at 11% formatting, it freezes completely. so, this must be a hardware problem...ive used each of the ram seperatly so i know none of them is bad. but i cant get them to work, and i dont know why. whats the deal? i thought this would take about 5 minutes and id be all set...not the whole damn day. &gt;_&lt; p.s. im 100% sure the ram is compatable with my mobo and it can handle that much
