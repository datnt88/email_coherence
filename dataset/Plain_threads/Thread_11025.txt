( we have 2) now, we recently had a new complicator built. nothing fancy just win7 64bit. when i tried to connect it to the network, it wouldn't even acknowledge it's existence. so i connected it to the other, not in the network, isp and bingo, connected like a champ. obviously, there is a setting missing somewhere. my question is, how do i get the new complicator to join the network? i've fished this around a few other threads but no-one seems to have a clue, so cnet, you're up!

10348	8	597208	5477358	5477241	zapstrap	7/15/13 3:35 pm	1.3739025e12	solved!	from another site: &quot;if you go into the nics properties and the advanced tab see if speed and duplex is set to auto. if it is set it to 10mb and full duplex and save the settings.&quot; did that and it worked... although i'm sure you were about to tell me that anyway, eh? haha... thanks eh.
