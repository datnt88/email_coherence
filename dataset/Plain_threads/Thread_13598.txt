(i can play songs, movie, browse internet simultaneously).if i restart the pc, it freezes. and if i try to boot it again, it doesnt boot. i keep it off for 1 hour. after 1 hour it runs for sometime and freezes again. mouse and keyboard also stop working. the only way to restart it to press cabinet button for 5 sec so supply to motherboard get cut off. so if i want to run it for long time, i need to keep it off at least 1 day and i cant restart it. i checked ram. it is working fine. my configuration is amd phenom x2 550 black edition. asus m2n68-am plus motherboard psu: xtech 450-24,max 450w gpu: nvidia geforce 7025/nforce 630a initial processor temperature is 36c which increases to 48c in 5 mins under zero load. i have updated my bios version from 0701 to 0804. so what could be the problem??
