(???) - no mention of any computers or printer. and if i look at &quot;network and sharing&quot; on the laptop, the map of my network shows both computers and the router, but no printer. i've done and redone network and wireless setups on both computers multiple times (this may be compounding the problem!), and always must try to make manual settings, since my &quot;host&quot; computer will only allow me to make a network system disk on a floopy, and the laptop has no floopy drive. and when i try to use the xp install disk, it simply deposits some files on the laptop, and thats it! so i try to do manual setups, but something's not right. i suspect that i've simply changed a setting somewhere, but after 3 days of changing and re-changing everything, i'm at my wits end. i've spent a good deal of time looking at the archives here, but am not finding anything that helps. thanks for any advice or suggestion on how to resolve this. john

4144	5	270344	2621611	2621610	pudgyone	11/3/07 2:41 pm	1.19410086e12	vista seems to be the problem	with printer sharing. there was a whole post on this. your answer lies in this post.  udating the drivers for the printer does help, but if you look at how kaufmanmoore gave the instructions on how he solved this problem and everyone else responded to him about how it worked, you'll understand what i'm trying to tell you. read the post entirely and i think you'll have a better understanding on what is going on. rick

4144	7	270344	2622432	2621611	drfugawe	11/4/07 9:21 pm	1.19421126e12	thanks rick - almost home	i read and followed the suggestions of kaufmanmoore - at first i couldn't get the host desktop to create a new local port, but then, being a basically paranoid guy, i uninstalled both instances of network magic (came with the zyxel router)from each machine, and backed up each to a date prior to nm's initial install. worked like a charm! now i'd hate to be left thinking that the folks at network magic slipped a gremlin into their software that causes newbies like me to think nothing will work except buying that expensive solution, but, ... i do anyway. only problem left is i'm still getting a message each time the laptop prints that says the printer driver needs updating - however, i did dl the new needed driver, but since there is no actual printer to install in the laptop, i had to manually install the driver, and it installed into the same folder in dl'ed into. i suspect that's incorrect. any final suggestion on how i can get it into a better location? thanks rick - i appreciate your invaluable assistance. john
4144	8	270344	2622491	2622432	pudgyone	11/5/07 1:55 am	1.1942277e12	like i said	this is really a vista glitch. most drivers are in the system32 folder. c://windows/system32 printer drivers need to be installed in each computer. my home printer setup is dell wireless printer adapter 3300 plugged into my dell photo aio printer 964. i installed the printer drivers in all three laptops(windows xp). i do not have to leave a host computer on to print. daughter can print from her room, son can also, aand i can print from the back patio, when it's nice out. we use a netgear router that has the firmware updated broadcast ssid use wpa security(wep can be hacked) use nothing else. never loose a connection and we can always print, scan, copy or fax when we want to. rick
