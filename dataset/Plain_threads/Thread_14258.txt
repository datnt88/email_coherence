6032	5	410342	3376829	3376786	willy	9/17/10 5:52 pm	1.28474592e12	look into...	in the event log, look for any obivous clue. since it freezes it won't be able to report but there's a chance it may. as for any heat issues, run the pc with cover off and fan blowing in and see if it lasts longer or gets further before a freeze. i mentioned a possible amd issue as together with the amd chipset could be an issue, but check the amd forum and query there and/or review what's posted. also, you may want to &quot;repaste&quot; the cpu to hsf setup using the thermo paste like arctic silver for better operation instead of any &quot;thermal tape setup. check arctic silver website for such details. tada -----willy
