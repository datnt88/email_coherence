(put the old video card back in & remove the new memory.) as for upgrading the memory, i hope you have deep pockets because the dimension 8250 used rdram which is very expensive. rdram memory sticks must be installed in matching pairs and 2 sticks of 256mb is currently running between $200 and $250. good luck.
