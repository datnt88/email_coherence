5147	6	400733	3336341	3336155	steven haninger	7/9/10 4:48 pm	1.27869408e12	i think you're messing with people here	as from your original post you stated &quot;and please nothing like go out and buy anti static gloves and crap.&quot; ....and now you're asking about gloves?? i suspect you didn't bother to read my post. everything you need to know and more is a mouse click away right there. had you read from the first reply to your post, you'd know your own thinking wasn't on the mark.
