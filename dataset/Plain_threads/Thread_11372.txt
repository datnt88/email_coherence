756	0	390181	3284568	nr	mcpjones	4/10/10 5:58 pm	1.27092228e12	proposed network setup	hi - i am looking to run a cat6 cable from one office to another two via a server cupboard and storage area, a large chunk (30-40m) of this cabling will be outside (in conduit pipes running alongside 240v mains cabling). here is a picture of what i propose to do, please ask if anything is unclear. i am sure something here must be wrong - i need you to tell me what!  thanks in advance

756	5	390181	3284825	3284809	r. proffitt	4/11/10 9:56 am	1.27097976e12	what i'm saying.	is that today's router is a collection of items we used to have boxes for. we would have a router, then a switched hub but today the switched hub is inside the common router. apology in advance as i don't expect everyone to remember all that or what stuff is made of or how things work. bob
756	6	390181	3284811	3284825	mcpjones	4/11/10 10:00 am	1.27098e12	right..	so i already have a switched hub built into the routers? does that mean everything is ok or because there are more than one of them will i have troubles?
756	7	390181	3284830	3284811	r. proffitt	4/11/10 10:10 am	1.2709806e12	sorry.	the only item that looked odd was the two connection on the server. since what a router is, what a hub is and what each does is on the internet i don't duplicate that here. at the top of this forum is a sticky note about how to use more than one router. as to multiple hubs, that's been done for years with little more than plug in the cables. bob
