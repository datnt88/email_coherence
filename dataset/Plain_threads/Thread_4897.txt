12532	2	232129	2395263	2395211	oblig	2/5/07 7:52 am	1.17066192e12	yes	both are ddr2 and i was going to leave tem in so if i get 800mhz memory it will run at 266mhz??? cheers chris
12532	3	232129	2395257	2395263	ray harinec	2/5/07 8:10 am	1.170663e12	another question	is your original memory a pair? thus running dual channel? if only a single, pull it out and with the new pair running at the max the mobo will support, may give you substantially more memory bandwidth and result in noticeably better performance, depending on what type programs you run. the new memory's latency looks fairly good for ddr2. maybe somewhat better than the older memory. we're only talking maybe totally 15% gains.

12532	5	232129	2395912	2395504	oblig	2/5/07 9:06 pm	1.17070956e12	sorry	for the delay its a ecs p965t-a and on there web site my mobo supports memory 4 x 240-pin ddr2 dimm socket support up to 8 gb support ddr2 800/667/533 mhz ddr2 memory and my pentium is a core 2 duo e6300 runing at 1.86ghz but im thinking of ocerclocking it to 333mhz fsb thats all the motherboard will do. so i need better memory but not sure wat type. and if i get better memory if i keep my old memoty in will it slow down my new memory thanks chris

12532	7	232129	2397717	2396342	oblig	2/7/07 8:53 pm	1.17088158e12	sorry	again for the delay my current memory is ddr2-sdram pc2-4300 (266 mhz) when i try to overclock my xp just desnt load but i havnt changed any voltages or anything like that so that may be the problem but not sure what to change it to chris
12532	8	232129	2398036	2397717	ramarc	2/8/07 7:07 am	1.17091842e12	re: ecs overclock	when you say you tried to overclock, i assume you just configured the memory as ddr2-667 and then xp failed to boot. if so, i recommend you just toss your current memory and get all new ddr2-667. if you're not familiar with ram overclocking techniques, it could take awhile for you to figure out the uppper limits of your current ram and you could wind up screwing something up. getting memory rated at ddr2-667 will leave you with the cpu overclock which is much easier (fewer settings to deal with). for specifc help with the overclocking, i suggest you make a post on anandtech.com (the site i referred you to earlier).
12532	9	232129	2398561	2398036	oblig	2/8/07 4:59 pm	1.17095394e12	thanks	i have just noticed that i have one memory in the orange and one in the purple do i need to put them both in the same color like the orange to have them dual. als could this be the problem when overclocking cheers chris
12532	10	232129	2398577	2398036	oblig	2/8/07 5:34 pm	1.17095604e12	also	i was looking at getting some better memory good memoty and fast for gaming do you have any suggestions. im looking to buy from ebuyer.co.uk cheers chris
12532	11	232129	2398632	2398561	vapcmd	2/8/07 6:40 pm	1.17096e12	stop...do not pass go....read the manual.	it should tell you exactly where to place the dimms you have for optimum performance. if your system supports dual channel architecture...you'll want to take advantage of that. vapcmd
12532	12	232129	2398909	2398632	oblig	2/9/07 6:08 am	1.17100128e12	here is wht	it supports up to 4xddr2 533/667/800 & dual channel (8gb maximum per dimm) going to look in book to see where to place them cheers
12532	13	232129	2398943	2398909	vapcmd	2/9/07 6:17 am	1.17100182e12	also check the mfgs website....sometimes they post	info on 'recommended ram' for their mbs. worthwhile to look at. vapcmd
