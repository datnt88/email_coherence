9480	18	287791	2729831	2729766	lionsmike	3/15/08 9:24 am	1.20557304e12	real clean is not neccessary	you can blow the dust out of the cooling fins with a can of compressed air, and then pick up what ever dust you can (your computer should be shut off) if you remove 85% or 90% of the dust, you have eliminated 85% or 90% of your danger. there are lots of little tricks like a small battery operated computer vacume which might even pick up some of the dust but one of my favorites is a turkey baster which you can use to blow or to suck up dust. i have seen people blow with their breath which contains a great deal of moisture and other contaminants; that is not a good thing. just be careful and be gentle and don't be too fussy. get out any heavy accumulation of dust.
