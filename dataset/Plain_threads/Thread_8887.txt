15364	6	145707	1635414	1632931	hztech	12/29/05 9:50 pm	1.135893e12	ok	a network interface card (nic) is a piece of hardware almost every computer (especially new ones) have. this is purely the connection point for your ethernet cables. to access your network adapter's porperties in windows xp, open your control panel, select network connections, find your active local area network connection and open it. in the window that comes up click the properties button and you will be in the place described earlier. to add the ipx/spx protocol, just click the button that says install, choose protocol and click ok, then choose the netbeui ipx/xpx protocol and click install. do this for both machines and then connect them to your router. if done correctly, all of the sharing settings should be all but automatic.

15364	9	145707	1636017	1635798	hztech	12/30/05 8:14 am	1.13593044e12	well direct connection takes a little extra	to directly connect one computer to another, you must first set a static ip on each computer from the same subnet. 192.168.0.x x being different for each computer. once that's done, you should see each computer, but if you access through a router, you just need to leave your tcp/ip settings at obtain automatically.
