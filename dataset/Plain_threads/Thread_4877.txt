11244	8	140647	1723297	1723226	ehackster	2/5/06 8:35 pm	1.1391717e12	ok...	xeno, tell me something, did you lower the brightness down and the contrast? what are your settings? i also noticed then when the screen is set to 100% black, there is some light bleeding from the background around the edges, do you have the same problem too? what about video playback? on mine when i played my seinfeld dvd it looked all grainy. does your do the same thing as well? now, don't get me wrong, i really find this monitor way above average, but this is my first lcd, so that is i am being a bit more critical about it. thanks for your reply.
11244	9	140647	1725509	1723297	ehackster	2/6/06 8:55 pm	1.1392593e12	yet another one	i opened my second box of the second hp1905b, and yet to discover again another quality issue. there is a large of what seems to be a dust particle stuck behind the lcd membrane and it is in the middle of the screen. baiscally whenever there is white, you see a gray dot of dust that cannot be removed. needless to say, the two monitors i have are returning to the store. i will get two hp f1905b though, just to give them a last chance. i like the clarity of the image, and it is a shame that i had qa issues 2/2. i will keep you posted.
11244	10	140647	1736182	1725509	xeno123	2/11/06 7:49 am	1.13964414e12	a flood of questions.	k, here goes, i'll try to answer all of those!: brightness/contrast i didnt change at all. i have my computer in an extremely bright room. and i like brightscreens :p as for the screen being slightly bright when brightness is set down to 0, that is because of the lcds backlight. all lcds have total black issues, and are noticable when gaming in dark maps... thats where plasmas have the upper hand. but that isnt an option really for a pc monitor video playback shouldnt be grainy. i havent noticed that... could it be the quality of the video source? if not then your screen has issues. one more thing though you might want to check is that you are running at native resolution. thats 1280*1024 for the f1905. due to the nature of lcds, they have seperate pixels that dont scale when you change the resolution, simply the image or video feed is scaled to that resolution. so lets say you are running 1600*1200 on it, you will have blurry pixels and such, due to that resolution being scaled down to 1280*1024. also if you found a peice of dust between the membrane and the backlight, that means your screen was a bad build, for sure return it. i hope you dont run into anything thats unexpected with your new monitor.
