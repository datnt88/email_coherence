(yes i know i'm an idiot for not backing up recently i already beat myself up for that) -i bought a usb to ide/sata adapter to try and get the data off -to get the drive to recognize i had to partition and format(really stupid of me i think) -nothing was on the drive when it finally did get recognized -i used easeus data recovery wizard professional 4.3.6 to try and get the data off but all i got was .gzip(17.5 gigs) files. -also, if you're wondering why i didn't just keep the drive and send the ps3 to sony. sony would send me a refurb unit and with the ps3 it asks you to reformat once you put a drive into the console that it wasn't originally on(same problem if i just took the hdd and put it into a friends ps3 to get data off) is there anything at all i can do to try and get my files off that hard drive? thank you so much for your help =(
