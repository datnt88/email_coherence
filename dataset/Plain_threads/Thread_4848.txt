[img]  [/img] with a burn like this, will the dvd+r still be readable 3 years from now? currently it's readable on the burner and another plain dvd drive though it's also lite-on branded. if not, then how long will it be before the data disappear? my disc contains pure data, no videos, burnt with maxell 8x dvd+r (bcn award 2005) thanks

186	5	260792	2569953	2567193	santuccie	8/24/07 7:18 pm	1.18798308e12	good question	i don't claim to know who makes the best optical discs, but it's pretty widely accepted that verbatim makes the best floppies. memorex's cds and dvds (definitely not their cassettes, though) have never failed me, but neither have hp's, and i've been using them since big lots! has been selling spindles cheaper than i've gotten them anywhere else (with the exception of last-in-stock sales). i have experienced occasional problems with sony, teon, and almost all the off-brands. i imagine there might be someone here whose experience might stand almost contradictory to my own, but this has been my own experience. don't know if this helps, but i hope it does. salute!

186	12	260792	2579868	2567193	rmf	9/8/07 5:21 am	1.18922886e12	verbatim	many years ago i had some important stuff on 8&quot; verbatim floppies. they became unreadable quickly. i have never used anything verbatim again and i have not lost anything again. fyi

186	14	260792	2580767	2565334	shadzofsilver	9/9/07 7:10 am	1.1893218e12	what about the readers?	a fact that most people miss is that an invincible dvd is useless if there's nothing to play it. the question is, if you can get your dvds to last 50-100 years, will there be a dvd player and compatible display around to play them in? take for instance the early cylindrical phonographs (if there's a real name for them, i don't know it). my grandfather has some, they've lasted a very very long time, but the problem is that the player didn't hold up so well. remember, this is with an analog signal, so you don't have to deal with different formats. playing back an analog signal from a record is a whole lot easier than resurrecting an &quot;ancient&quot; digital one. do you have an 8 inch floppy drive? while dvd players could be manufactured again in the future, just as cylindrical phonograph players sometimes are, i think it's worth mentioning that you'll need to have a reader as well as the media.
