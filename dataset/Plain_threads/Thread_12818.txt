[primary ide, secondary ide] western digital drives have somewhat unusual jumpering if you are not using cable select jumpering [and a ribbon cable that supports cs] (all 80 conductor {40 pin}cables support cs). for normal maste / slave jumpering the wd drives use different jumpering if it is to be a masrter and there is to not be a slave on the ribbon cable. if it is to be a master and a slave to be on the ribbon cable [and the slave must be there all the time]. actually as master with no slave there is no jumper, however in order to have a jumper available if needed they put the jumper horizontally just for storage, thuus that is actually no jumper as far as the drive configuration is concerned. now if using cable select [cs] (csel], the master drive must be connected to the end connector and the slave connected to the middle connector. {not always nice if the hard drive is low in the case and the atapi drive higher up in the case. if you have two ide ports on the mobo, easiest to attach each to a different cable.
