(just checked, it only works on &quot;mac&quot; disks) others to consider are drive genius, data rescue iii and file salvage. i gather from the statement, &quot;can't afford to lose the contents&quot;, that you do not have a backup of this data. the drive itself is probably still under warranty but that only covers replacement. seagate will recover the data for you but be prepared to fork out many hundreds of dollars (insert currency of choice) for the service. let us know about the format thing. p
1139	2	376364	3211422	3211378	roskers	1/2/10 8:04 am	1.26241944e12	many thanks	many thanks for your excellent help. in fact, disk utility reports that the volume is mac os extended format, so i think i followed the instructions when setting up the disk. this wasn't with disk utility, but with the supplied software on the drive. i don't have a backup to the data - photos and music mainly - so this is a huge problem. from what you say, disk warrior may well do the trick?
1139	3	376364	3211637	3211422	roskers	1/2/10 12:32 pm	1.26243552e12	update	i'm loath to part with $99 which is the cost for most of the utilities. i've found a trial version of file salvage which may allow me to explore the drive (it recognises it) and salvage the files. the option to remount the drive is, i think, only available in the paid-for version. i'll update this with news of success or otherwise if this is a help to others. in the meanwhile, any other suggestions will be gratefully received.

1139	5	376364	3212062	3211755	roskers	1/3/10 12:00 am	1.2624768e12	disk warrior	yes, i'm also expecting that. hopefully seagate will come up with a solution, as i am sure that i am not the only one that has experienced this. interestingly, i've an older and smaller lacie drive attached that has never caused any problems. if i can recover the files from the seagate drive, i'm tempted to dump it and return to the lacie stable. it's also a shame that mac's disk utility doesn't really do the job that it should (in my case, at least). it should fix this problem and not report that all is well when i run the first aid option. i guess that's why disk warrior and others are in the game.
