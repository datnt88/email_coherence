4279	4	251273	2508091	2508074	boya84	6/7/07 7:19 pm	1.18124394e12	i suggest you get familiar with	it is a great resource. on you dvx100 - what format were you shooting in? imovie does not recognize all - you need finalcut for the good stuff.   the video i imported from the dvx100 to imovie was 4:3 standard def...
4279	5	251273	2508095	2508091	boya84	6/7/07 7:27 pm	1.18124442e12	sorry - i did not actually respond to the original issue...	the inability to import has nothing to do with the apple macintosh hardware you were - or are using. the issue is that imovie is a free, consumer-grade, relatively low-end video editing application. if you were capturing in 24p or some other high-end, it was not designed to handle that. you need finalcut... i don't know if express will do - i've been using pro (in the studio bundle) for a bit, and it does pretty much everything. i suggest a quick read through of   sorry for all the posts... hope they help, though...

4279	7	251273	2508487	2508298	mitchdance	6/8/07 8:13 am	1.18129038e12	it was a fear, with hope	the problem with the last macbook i had was it said it could not read a camera other then the webcam... when i got the new gen a day ago i hadnt tried to upload yet... im doing so today in hopes that it works. thanks to everyone who put in input
4279	8	251273	2508474	2508487	mrmacfixit	6/8/07 8:19 am	1.18129074e12	how were you trying to input video into the mac?	the third post in this thread should be all you need to do. hopefully you purchased the optional ieee1394 cable for the camera p
