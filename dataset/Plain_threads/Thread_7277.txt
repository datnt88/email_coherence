2381	12	570157	5347383	5347393	r. proffitt	8/14/12 9:16 am	1.34493576e12	this could be a first.	this would be the first dell i've heard of without a manual eject. too bad the exact models of the dell, the drive are not in the discussion. with the details i could look for pictures or more. bob

2381	15	570157	5347389	5347379	r. proffitt	8/14/12 10:21 am	1.34493966e12	can't find a clear picture of that model.	but it is time to look for the eject pin hole on the face of the drive. bob
