(i ended up uninstalling it as i'm %99 non-vpn and might use vpn %1 of the time.) ''greenbow_vpn'' is another solution spoken about in many forums. this client was easy to setup to connect to my befvp41, however the public license is only for a ''30-60 day trial''. i uninstalled it. after much searching, i came across the ''draytek'' vpn client. written by draytek in china for their brand of vpn routers, this client loads a device driver as part of its client solution. the driver comes up as another ''network connection'' under xp. the nice part about all this is that the client program/driver will create network configuration changes ''on the fly'' thereby not breaking connections when the vpn is not in use. this was also easy to setup to connect to my befvp41. when the tunnel is active/connected, the client application will show a little ''green light'' indicator and the connection will not have a red x ontop of it in the system tray. pretty cool. so what does all this have to do with ''network shares over a vpn?'' in all cases, while i was able to get the clients to work (connect) with my linksys vpn router, i was unable to access the vpn router or any of the network shares attached to it. i finally decided that my routing tables must not be setup correctly to route to&lt;=&gt;from my lan addresses through the vpn tunnel. 1. client address &lt;=&gt; server address 65.mylaptop &lt;=&gt; 66.mylan 2. client secure group &lt;=&gt; server secure group 192.168.2.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 this dident work. i read somewhere that the lan segments on both ends needed to be different. 3. client secure group &lt;=&gt; server secure group 192.168.4.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 this dident work ether. after much reading, i'm under the (miss)understanding that: a. the tunnel needs to have a different ip address scheme then ether of the lan segments on ether end. b. the tunnel needs to have a different ip address scheme then the fqdn of ether end. c. i have to manually setup route's on each end to direct traffic through the tunnel. client address &lt;=&gt; server address 65.mylaptop &lt;=&gt; 66.mylan clientsecuregroup (addr) &lt;=&gt; serversecuregroup (addr) 10.0.2.1 &lt;=&gt; 10.0.1.1 client lan segment &lt;=&gt; server lan segment 192.168.4.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 client side: route add 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.1 &lt;serverend&gt; route add 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.0 10.0.2.1 &lt;clientend&gt; server side (in vpn router): route add 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2 &lt;clientend&gt; route add 10.0.2.1 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.1 &lt;serverend&gt; i'll let you all know if this works. in the mean time i'm sure that the readers of this forum will show me the errors of my ways.... &lt;g&gt; mark.
