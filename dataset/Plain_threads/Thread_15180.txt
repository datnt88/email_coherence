11637	0	114451	1300424	nr	chiltonj	7/15/05 8:12 am	1.12141512e12	got my refurbished emachines t6212, now....	just got in for $499. everything looks great so far. i added a ati radeon x800 xl pcie, and that is working great (wish that card had 2 dvi ports though). got 2 x 1gb 400ddr pc3200 memory sticks. haven't received just yet. the mobo appears to be msi. logitech z-2300 speakers are on the way also. now for the fun stuff: i am going to swap the hard drive with the two other drives from my older computer. i am going to move my ati hdtv tuner from the old computer to the t6212. several questions: 1. do i need additional ps wattage? the one in the box is 300w (or 350, i forgot but i am pretty sure it is 300) 2. sounds like i can't overclock the pc but can i overclock my ati graphics card? 3. what happens to the integrated memory set aside for the graphics now that i have my own card? 4. i can merge two monitors together using the dvi and vga port on the ati card but the quality drops (1280x???) instead of 1920x1200. is there any way possible that i can have the two monitors setup on the same machine and use one screen for the pc and use the other screen for tv viewing? 5. with 4 slots for memory, i am hoping that i can throw the 2 sticks of 1gb with the other 2 slots that are filled with 2 x 256 for a total of 3gb??? thanks.

(i did exactly the cnet weekend project told me)
