7235	4	246358	2479640	2479517	numlok	5/6/07 1:40 pm	1.1784588e12	drivesavers	i'm not sure i understand your post. we do use drivesavers. they actually did the data recovery on our last drive failure. they were able to recover just over 100gb off the drive (unfortunately lacking directory structure), and it ran just over $1200. they're convenient since they're just across the bridge in novato (we're in sf). what exactly is your point, and how does it relate to the original question of &quot;sata150 10krpm vs. sata3gb+raid&quot;? ???

7235	7	246358	2479948	2479925	numlok	5/6/07 8:31 pm	1.17848346e12	thanks.	good info. the only controller i'm planning on using is the one built into the tyan s2696a2nrf motherboard (  ). at the moment, i'm actually leaning toward using two raptors striped (raid 0), and relying on the network storage for really important data backup. make sense? thanks again!
7235	8	246358	2480341	2479948	ramarc	5/7/07 8:35 am	1.1785269e12	more info	intel's built-in raid controllers on their server boards are pretty good (but a bit feature starved). your backup strategy (like most people's) doesn't appear to include image backups. so, if either drive fails, you'll have to reinstall the os and all of your software. even if you ghost a bare install to the replacement drive(s), you'll still lose a day or two. if you don't do image backups and daily incrementals, then i recommend a mirror for the os and apps. the difference between 7200rpm and 10000rpm drives for app loading/interaction is minimal. (for a server, the faster access time raptors provide is a big benefit, but for a workstation you won't see that much improvement in your daily activities.) the raptors speed will be seen in pagefile/scratchfile performance and reading/writing large datasets (like video editting, big photoshop images, etc.). that same speed benefit can be achieved with 2 7200rpm drives in a stripe set. as for relying on the network as your main backup method, the wisdom of that all depends on the backup policy of your network. aslo, simply copying files to the network is not a good backup strategy. some type of full backup (at least for your data files tree) along with incrementals/differentials is essential.
