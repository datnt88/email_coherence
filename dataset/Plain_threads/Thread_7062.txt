1401	4	589110	5439800	5439785	kasetion	3/21/13 6:20 pm	1.36389e12	nothing yet	no signs of life on the single module stuck under the v8 fan; i'd hate to rip the fan out, just to unplug the module, put the fan all back together again, test it, and then have to tear it all apart once more if it turns out that's not the problem, though.
