(had to hold power button in for 10 seconds to turn off) sometimes the screen saver would be frozen also and i detected sounds. i turned off the hibernate mode thinking that might be causing this glitch but it recurred again with the fans racing. the last time this happened i turned the computer back on and the fans stayed in this racing mode and the screen remained black. (won't boot} the video is nvidea geforce 6100 and i assume this is built in as there are no other cards. could this be why i have no monitor (amber light is on) yet monitor works with my other computer? would putting another video card in the open pci slot bypass the built-in video? thank you
