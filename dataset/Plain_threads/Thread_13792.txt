(no video on boot)	i recently took out my 2 gtx460's to replace the thermal paste and had my computer working fine afterwords until a crash when playing crysis which made my computer have a hard time booting back up... i then proceeded to take the card out, take the heatsink off and make sure everything was fine, and then reseat it once again... it didnt work at all (no video at boot) so i decided to swap the cards (slot 1 to slot 2 and vice versa) to see if that would work and it did...however the computer couldnt detect the second card for sli so once again i took them out and tried reseating them as well as only having one card in at a time and now neither of them work at all!! no video signal on either on them, so i dont know what to do all i did was reseat the darn things, its not like i cracked them in the process or anything... please help, ive been working on this for hours to no avail...help would be appreciated

4308	5	543672	5214640	5214553	shanetm	10/8/11 1:20 pm	1.31808e12	ocz	its a 700 watt ocz stealth or something... i brought it into a shop i've been to in the past so they can deal with the frustrations so i don't have the exact model name or anything they have been a good help for me in the past so hopefully they can fix it this time as well...
4308	6	543672	5214925	5214640	vapcmd	10/9/11 8:45 am	1.3181499e12	ok.....let us know how it works out.	my guess is the psu isn't sufficient to handle two 460s and whatever else you have in the system. what prompted you to remove the gpu heatsinks ...were they really running hot ? vapcmd
4308	7	543672	5214983	5214925	shanetm	10/9/11 5:44 pm	1.31818224e12	sort of the reason...	what happened was i had two different models of the gtx460... an msi cyclone and a pny xlr8 (both 1 gig) the pny one tended to be quite audible vs the msi due to its heatsink design being different, as well as the heat lvls being a little bit higher, so thats why i decided to change the paste. it was absolutely caked on both of them, probably more then 4x more than needed when i removed the sinks so it was definately in my interest to do so especially since i use mx4 paste which is pretty good quality vs what the manufacturers use i'm sure

4308	9	543672	5215218	5215130	shanetm	10/10/11 9:28 am	1.31823888e12	correct.	i believe that is the model of psu i have. also, my point was that when i took off the heatsinks the first time, there was way too much paste on both of them. it looked like they were trying to ice a cake or something. so thats why i went ahead and replaced it on both of them with much less of a higher quality paste. chances are i just didn't put the heatsinks back on completely perfectly. i should be getting a call tomorrow from the little shop i brought it to so i can pick it up. i will update then as to what the issue turns out to be. in the meantime. i appreciate everybody interest in my issue and for trying to give me a hand!
