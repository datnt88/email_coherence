(i may be wrong though.) what is the status of this card in today's world? it has an agi 8x slot. most games list their requirements in terms of nvidia this or that or ati radeon this or that. can i fix a non-intel card in that agi slot? (of course i'll get a professional to install it.) recently titan quest has refused to run my system, and it really boils my blood.. what is the best solution for my problems? i want an agp card that is not too highly priced and has a good value for money. by the way, i remember having read somewhere that it is possible to disable this intel on-board card. can it be done? thanks a lot in advance. plz help me out.
