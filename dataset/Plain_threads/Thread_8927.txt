11193	11	125460	1425451	1425110	psidd	9/16/05 7:35 pm	1.1268993e12	why not give it a try	for a while i wanted an lcd monitor as i liked the space & weight saving, lower energy and heat but was put off by people saying crt will always be better for gaming due to refresh rates among other factors and cost. i used to play half life on my old sony laptop and it was quite horrible-all that ghosting! but last year i got a new pc so it was a perfect opportunity to try lcd and i was impressed as they have improved nowadays. now mines got 13ms refresh rate (which shouldnt't always be the deciding issue) and was really impressed by the picture as it wasnt really an expensive one and so i thought the performance wouldnt be great but i love it. even though i dont play a lot of fast pc games (i've played half life and now i'm playing moh allied assault) i really cant complain, its ok for me as i'm not a hardcore pc gamer (i prefer consoles) who can pick out all the niggles. now that lcds have even quicker sub 10ms response times they must be even better so go for it as you wont regret it unless you already made up your mind about crt. almost forgot, they are great fro movies too!

11193	19	125460	1461794	1461739	garyrw	10/7/05 6:45 am	1.1286675e12	you're right	i have a pair of 21'' hp p1130 flat crt's i bought used at the end of 3 yr corporate lease. they can do better than 1920x1080 needed for the top hdtv broadcasts. you can't even buy a plasma, lcd, dlp that will do that now. once you've seen true 1920x1080 hdtv you won't want to go back to the lower 720 res hdtv. practically all your broadcast hdtv programming is 1920x1080. yes, there is work on newer crt's with electron guns parallel to the screen allowing much shorter depth, but you're still going to have a big weight disadvantage because of the need to protect the vacuum stresses. and what kind of complexity and weight will be needed to deflect electron beam almost 90 degrees?
11193	20	125460	1461809	1461791	garyrw	10/7/05 6:53 am	1.12866798e12	check this...	if you're getting any flicker at all on a crt check your display settings to make sure the refresh hasn't been changed to 60 hz rather than 72+ hz. sometimes programs (mostly games in the past) reset this when autoswitching to a higher resolution that the crt can only display at 60 hz. even highend crt's can do 80+ hz these days at high resolution.
