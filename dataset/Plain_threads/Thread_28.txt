(and i also found a intel p4 cpu that was 2.8ghz. can that also be on the motherboard?)  im not sure exactly what that is under the socket the was a metal heatsink i think siting there...um how can i say this it had 2 hooks or pins that was suppose to hold it down into place...the other pin is broken off...and im not sure if the motherboard had a agp slot but if it did its broken off as you can see... the reason why is because the computer just shuts off.....the computer was working, it was just shuting off and i thought it was because of that being off the motherboard those 2 things....
12551	1	121460	1377318	1376916	willy	8/23/05 5:42 am	1.12477572e12	let's see...	you said: &quot;the reason why is because the computer just shuts off.....the computer was working, it was just shuting off and i thought it was because of that being off the motherboard those 2 things....&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ i suspect the heatsink clasps you mentioned broken can be replaced. if you can try a plastic/nylon screws&nuts found in h/w stores that fit. -or- try you're local computer shop to retrieve one from a broken system, etc. laying about. yeah, it shuts down if heat build-up is too great, do the fix, asap. as for the mtrbd. replacement is relative. if you retain the emachine case, many atx type mtrbds. will work, but necessarily all holding posts can be used, beware of that. you need to verify once installed, the mounting posts wehere they are and if extra not shortening out the new mtrbd. or if less that flexing isn't an issue. hope this helps... tada -----willy
12551	2	121460	1377397	1377318	dragonbssj	8/23/05 6:29 am	1.12477854e12	okay....	but that wasnt really a answer more i fact i think... but this is a picture i made to show what exactly i am talking about.  the t1862 motherboard is a vc37  intel 845gl chipset, performance uatx mainboard for intel pentium 4 processor. 400mhz fsb, embedded graphics, ddr266, on-board audio, lan option, ultra ata100, usb 2.0 now im asking if theres a way that i can fix this or i could just buy one of these motherboards on this website.  im asking which motherboard out of the ones on that site is the best one to pick from?

12551	4	121460	1379569	1378861	dragonbssj	8/23/05 5:59 pm	1.12481994e12	oh	well i kinda seen that myself i believe it narrows down to the only 2 i see that is matx refurbished: asrock p4vm800 socket 478 via p4m800 micro atx intel motherboard - oem refurbished: biostar p4vma-m socket 478 via pm800 micro atx intel motherboard - oem td25x said to go with the biostar but why do that? i am asking because to me i think the asrock looks better for one thing it has more usb ports on that one.
