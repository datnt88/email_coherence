1580	1	92886	1048796	1048708	ozos	3/16/05 4:45 pm	1.1109915e12	might i reccomend...	 aside from that here are some things a pc needs: motherboard - the basis of the system, everything is connected to this power supply - don't skimp, you want a good unit from ocz, antec, forton source, enermax, or ttgi superflower, as this powers the computer, and is often the most common source of problmes cpu - this does the majority of data processing in the system, again, don't skimp gpu - here is where your graphics are done, pcie or agp 8x, this depends on the motherboard/cpu combination you choose hdd - hard drives, your storage, how much you need? ram - memory, i suggest at least 1gb, running in 2x512 (2 512mb sticks, thus, dual channel (if you have a dual channel motherboard) and pc 3200 or faster (pc 3200 is what you need to run 1:1 with basically every chip out there (yes, including the 800fsb intel chips) but you can get faster ram if you'd like (no need unless your overclocking)) i'd suggest some of the following parts: abit an8 $144 @ newegg amd athlon64 3800+ (socket 939) $380 (oem) or $385 (retial) @ newegg thermalright xp-90 $49.99 @ newegg (get a 92mm fan for this also) 1gb (2x512) pc 3200 ddr:  geforce 6600nu pcie  and your choice of sata hard drives for the psu i'd suggest one of the following: antec neopower 480w ocz powerstream 520w as for a case you just have to pick one you like same goes for optical drives, just pick one/ones with features you like and you also have to choose if you want a floppy drive

1580	8	92886	1066045	1065097	gmartin2r	3/23/05 1:12 pm	1.11158352e12	socket 479	i thought something didnt quite seem right. i just looked at the intel cpu that i was thiking about getting and it's a lga775 socket cpu. i was looking at a 3.2 ghz prescott core p4 chip so that might be something esle to watch for. i'd look for at least a p4 530 chip or higher. the 3.2 is a 540 chip. they do run very warm though so if you go with a prescott core cpu be sure you've got good case cooling. especially if you're running a video card that generates much heat. dont know about the dvd recording. my guess would be it would hold the same as with audio but i'm not sure. wahtever the case though either make of cpu given a high enough speed will do the job nicely. meaning an amd 3500+ will do the job nicely as will a p4 of the same speed. if you're going to be doing audio work, i'd recommend getting a quality sound card, which will take a pci slot. i've got an audigy 2 zs gamer and it's an excellent card. unless you've got a good reason to go micro-atx i'd probably go standard atx form. gives you more room to work inside the case and more room for heat dissipation too if you do go with a prescott cpu. as fro boards; umm, i guess head to newegg and search for boards that are socket lga775 compatible. then look at the form factor(atx, m-atx). the chipset is somewhat hard to nail down for me currently. i think the newest chipset from intel at least is the 915 series. i was looking at a 915p chipset. if you can find a board that supports it, it might be worth investing in dual channel ddr too. i'm a bit fuzzy on how it works but it gives you roughly a 10% increase in performance vs single channel ddr. pc3200 is the absolute min that you should go for. i'd look into at least ddr433 or ddr500 and initially have at least a gig of it. and yea an 800mhz fsb is very important to have so the fsb isnt the choke point on the computer.
1580	9	92886	1066192	1063857	john robie	3/23/05 2:14 pm	1.11158724e12	cpu & motherboard	hi steepleboy, gmartin suggest the intel socket lga775 and to look at the p4 530 or 540 . i agree with the intel socket lga775 and suggest as an alternate to p4 5xx, the new p4 630 (3.0ghz) $237, or the p4 640 (3.2ghz) $288, with the 64-bit technology (em64t) for the future, and also with the pci-express bus technology. the 6xx series also has 2mb of l2 cache, whereas the 5xx series have 1mb, 533, or less depending on other varables. for a motherboard to go along with the lga775 socket & lets say the $288 p4 640: $236 - asus p5ad2-e premium i925xe chipset +ich6r $224 - abit &quot;fatality aa8xe 925xd $208 - asus p5ad2-e deluxe i925xe chipset +ich6r $196 - intel &quot;boxd925xfcv2lk i925xe chipset $169 - intel &quot;boxd925xcvlk 925x chipset $147 - intel &quot;boxd915pbll 915p chipset $148 - asus &quot;p5gdc deluxe i915p +ich6r $115 - gigabyte &quot;ga-81915p duo prov (rev1.1)&quot; 915p chipset i would also add more cooling like for instance a $34 artic-cooling freezer 7 cpu cooler for socket lga775, model acfrz7 the pci-express technology is slowly replacing the pci bus and also the agp bus for video cards. features of the intel pentium 4 processor 6xx supporting hyper-threading technology 2 mb of l2 cache = a larger cache size can help the processor more efficiently run many popular applications in digital imaging, music, video and gaming. intel extended memory 64 technology&#934; = provides flexibility for future applications that support both 32-bit and 64-bit computing. execute disable bit =
