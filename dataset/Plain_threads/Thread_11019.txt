(deep orange, kind of faded, light rainbow) - organized? (straight lines, constant width/size)? - disorganized? (random dots, segments, waves)? - traveling? (moving from where to where)? if it's a light rainbow, it could be a magnetic field from an electronic device deflecting electrons from the cathode ray gun (unshielded speakers commonly cause this). however, there needs to be a dynamic magnetic field for this to occur intermittently, i.e., speaker power needs to be changing or speakers need to be moving.
