40	1	381481	3239375	3239246	r. proffitt	2/4/10 5:22 am	1.26526092e12	here's the list i like.	and it is sorted by bucks! -&gt;  &quot;radeon hd 5750 (check prices) great 1920x1200 performance in most games radeon hd 5770 codename: rv840 &quot;juniper&quot; process: 40nm universal shaders: 720 texture units: 36 rops: 16 memory bus: 128-bit core speed mhz: 700 memory speed mhz: 1,150 (4,600 effective) directx/shader model: dx 11/sm 5.0 while the radeon hd 5750 offers similar gaming performance to it's less-expensive competition (the radeon hd 4850 and geforce gts 250), it has better longevity appeal with directx 11 support. sporting dolby truehd/dts-hd master audio and three monitor outputs, the 5750 might appeal to those who want a low-power gaming card appropriate for an htpc.&quot;
