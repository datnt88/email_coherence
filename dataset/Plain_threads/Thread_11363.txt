776	5	189437	2055205	2055182	r. proffitt	7/8/06 4:15 pm	1.1523753e12	no.	i've only seen 64-bit versions of linux, vista, xp and no extra eyecandy. however this area is important to a lot of scientific endeavors since the 32 bit address space (we get to talk about virtual memory operating systems) is not big enough for some work. off the top of my head is the astronomy area. it's a big universe with big numbers. bob
