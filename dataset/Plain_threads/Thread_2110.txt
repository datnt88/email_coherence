13316	3	534432	5170041	5169327	willy	7/20/11 8:50 am	1.3111518e12	imo, i'll say...	copy? of win7, 64-bit isn't going to help you. it may come back to bite you. get the oem version(diy type) and go from there and be done with licensing. if you're going to be pushing the pc, then absolutely go add liquid cooling. while typical air cooling may suffice once you go liquid and it's done right, its a real plus. unless, you find you really need 16gb of ram, you maybe better off with 8gb. you can hopefully upgrade ram later to 16gb. even with your s/w demands, 8gb is still very capable, of course that can be addressed if the need arises, that's up to you. last, use the ssd as a os install rather than a pgm. tool area of work. ssd have weakness in repeated use of r/w and persistent use of the same data locations can spell bad news later. however, some pgms. install will only default to drive &quot;c&quot;, if you can install elsewhere, do so. i meantion that as thre ssd will get loaded pretty quick if no attention here. this is a known problem(google on topic), but has been addressed. high-end ssd drives that are hi-perf types and/or latest do well. i still recommend a typical hd to do the real grunt work you plan to do. tada -----willy &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

13316	5	534432	5170957	5170221	willy	7/21/11 10:49 am	1.31124534e12	ok...	to add to the os side of things, the alienware one isn't necessasy going to work &quot;if&quot; you plan to use on the new system. while the other os supplied is ok, i hope it works well for ya. keep any papaerwork in case you have issues later. i also, like to comment on the memory, if that's good, then that's good. i hope it works well for ya. now for the ssd, as i explained some ssds won't last long if they get used extensively regrdless of how. the nature of ssd is that repeated usage of the same area will cause a failure or a fault, thought hey are more robust than flash drives, the problem is often seen on these as well. the whole reason for explaining this is that when they go bad, they just go, no clue they're gone. please google on the topic of ssds and find this out. nwer ssd released maybe better at handling these issues since the newer sandbridge(force?) releases. tada -----willy

13316	9	534432	5172621	5169327	brechan	7/24/11 8:22 am	1.31149572e12	why tiger direct, and other questions	why buy from this e-tailer when there are others out there with more competitive prices (e.g. newegg.com); from the list of components you have provided (although some are not available through newegg), there are far better choices/ prices provided by newegg  second; do not scrimp on the psu, although ultra may be tigerdirects best (in-house) brand, for the same money you should be spending it on a more reputable company (e.g. antec, corsair, silverstone, and the like). third; while others may argue that &quot;all-in-one&quot; liquid cooling solutions (such as the corsair h50/ h70/ h80) are the next best thing to custom water cooling, they are not. these solutions are no better than a &quot;lesser&quot; priced air cooler. forth; while buying a computer case is strictly a personal choice only you can make, make sure the case you get fulfills all your needs...there's nothing worse than getting into the nitty-gritty of the build, only to find that the case you've chosen is more of a nightmare come true, rather than the dream you were wishing for. fifth; i have to agree with willy on the point of having an ssd, the point of having an ssd in your system is to make the o/s and other &quot;key&quot; programs run faster, rather than the &quot;old-school&quot; way of thinking, where the main hdd was for every program under the sun...then using other (internal or external) drives for storage and backup. best to have a smaller ssd for the o/s and a few programs that are used often; then get another &quot;fast&quot; drive for everything else.
