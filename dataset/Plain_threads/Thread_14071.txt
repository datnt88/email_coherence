(both power cables? the 20-pin and 4-pin connectors) or if you have a 24-pin board, is the adapter correctly connected? i would suggest making sure all connections are secure including the cpu hsf i would ensure the front power on switch is wired correctly beyond that, the only thing i can think of is to check that your not running power back into the psu (easy to do if your using adapters for your fans (3pin small to 4pin molex) and connected everything to everything (so there are no open ends) and it can easily run power back into your psu, and it won't run with power going into an output
