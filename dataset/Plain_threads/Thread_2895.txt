(yet!!!) but i have had to use all 3 copies to recover data, some files.

'what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer' again i don't think so. one thing it is looking for is &quot;lost clusters&quot;, clusters that are marked as in use but they are not. another thing it is looking at is the &quot;indexes&quot;. i could go on but i won't.
