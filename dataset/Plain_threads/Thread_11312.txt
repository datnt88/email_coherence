(yes, i have three teenage children using this computer, how did you know?) now i can't seem to turn the bluetooth &quot;on&quot;. any ideas on how to get the icon back? the control panel says the device is working, but i get no connection. i have the bluetooth wizard, bluetooth places folder, and plenty of bluetooth files. . . just can't get connected without the icon's control. . . maybe there is an alternate &quot;on&quot; switch i could use ?
