3116	11	597325	5478516	5478507	redorblue89	7/18/13 4:45 pm	1.3741659e12	no offence intended but...	i wasn't flaming, just explaining my point. i agree about overclocking but my system has a very slight overclock with no voltage change and only slight clock changes on a cpu that is part of the k family. meaning unlocked multipliers, meaning much further overclocking. considering this the clock on my cores is extremely moderate. and i never stress the machine. so how exactly have i been pushing my machine then? also the psu wattage is far higher than the full draw of my machine. i don't mind criticism as long as its constructive.
