9893	4	273956	2642932	2642875	pluch00	12/1/07 8:24 am	1.19649744e12	it seems...	western digital was saying that 55 degrees celcius should be the maximum temperature during full use. so it's definitely an issue that i'm idling so hot. i don't really use the cd-rom drive much, it's probably worth ditching that to mount one of the hard drives there? i'd do that, but i'm not sure if that will bring the temperature down enough as there still isn't much airflow over them. i think they built this with the capability of two drives but only enough space to keep one cool. i'll work on a pic. is there a way to post them?

9893	8	273956	2644173	2642986	pluch00	12/2/07 8:35 pm	1.1966277e12	i did some tinkering.	alrighty. i got an inexpensive hard drive cooler similar to the one vapcmd linked to. the only difference is this one was on clearance at circuit city. there wasn't any space to mount it to the hotter of the two drives, at least not below it. so i ended up moving the main drive to the bottom and the new drive to the top where i installed it upside down. then i took out the floppy drive above it. after custom drilling a couple of holes for the upside down drive, i taped(yes, tapes) the hard drive fan above it in place of the floppy drive since there was no way to screw it in anywhere. currently, i'm back up and running with idle temps at 28 and 31 degrees celcius. i'm not sure if i'm leveled out here or if the computer is still getting warmed up. if i'm leveled out, then this fan and new positioning did the trick as it's about 15-20 degrees cooler than before. my only question now is the hum i'm noticing. it's basically a low hum and you can feel it pulsing if you rest your hand on the case. it's very low, but i can't say that i've heard it on any other computer. it started with the new drive being installed right-side up, so i'm not sure what it's from. any ideas?
