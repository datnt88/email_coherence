(3 or 4 tracks) but how does one &quot;play&quot; an audio track in dos mode? irregardless, i think i've stumbled on the culprit. although i've been running 2 x 256 kingston sticks of pc2100 ddram for the past year without a hitch, another fellow suggested running memtest (  ), which i did with oodles of memory errors. perhaps it wasn't the defragging after all... looks like i've got my work cut out for me...! any tips on memory troubleshooting would be gratefully accepted!
