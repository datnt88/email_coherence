10996	7	147320	1649206	1648962	r. proffitt	1/5/06 3:58 pm	1.13647668e12	please don't be vague.	99.99% of the time set the tcpip settings in xp and 2000 to dhcp then plug them into the dlink router. bingo. they are now networked. you have yet to reveal what networking feature is not working or if you can't share files or more. i can't guess what step is eluding you. you may have done something like installed a firewall and didn't allow filesharing, but this is yet to be revealed. please take time to tell more. bob
