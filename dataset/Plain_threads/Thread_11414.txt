(i'm still trying to get my head around that 1,000,000 hour number &lt;sigh&gt;...)

5067	8	408825	3370279	3369841	markflax	9/6/10 3:17 am	1.28374302e12	i might do that.	i know knoppix wouldn't be able to read raid 0 drives, (at least from a few years ago), so maybe ubuntu live cd can do that now. just a thought though. this os is fine, (at the moment), and no risk of running out of space. unless i misunderstood what you say. if the ssd's become read only then the os fails, but if the os is working then i haven't reached that point yet. or perhaps i misunderstood in another way. booting from ubuntu is a good test to see if any sectors have become read only? whichever, it's time i got myself a replacement for knoppix so i will try ubuntu. mark
