9420	7	262369	2574566	2574386	coryphaeus	8/31/07 5:45 pm	1.1885823e12	oh yeah. . .	i'm well familiar with resolutions. but the specific one for that monitor was not listed. i could set it a little below and the picture, specifically text was not good. above the native and i got the screen message, &quot;out of range!&quot;.
9420	8	262369	2579901	2574000	kuliddar	9/8/07 5:46 am	1.18923036e12	samsung 932bf 19&quot; standard	well i finally took the plunged and aquired last night the samsung i had mentioned. wow!!! talk about an improvement. i'm still tweaking the settings but already i am impressed. after much research my fears about how older games would look like had abated a bit. i loaded up master of orion 2 and found out that i could play with native resolution by &quot;changing&quot; it to what was required for me to play (640x480 for this game). i'm not sure if that is standard but my video card allowed me this. it looks a tad bit soft but its nothing major. came with a dvi corde so i was all set. yay!!!
