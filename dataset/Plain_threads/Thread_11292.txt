2691	12	304654	2835941	2835771	mrmacfixit	8/17/08 7:43 am	1.21895898e12	no internet connection needed.	as mentioned by ricato, you don't need anything connected to your imac. however, if it is still connected to the internet, that's not a problem. on completion of the install, os x will be able to configure your network preferences if the ethernet cable is plugged in. on the subject of the version of os x you are planning on installing. you mentioned 10.1.4 in one of your posts. i missed that but assumed that you meant 10.4.x. this is important as 10.1.4 does not run on an intel mac and it you have an imac with a dual processor so it must be an intel powered imac. i suggest that your os is 10.4.x a look at the disks that came with the machine, you do have those?, will tell you what version of the os they hold. any &quot;backup&quot; that is &quot;internalized&quot; is not a backup. it is a disaster waiting to happen. for instance: you make a backup of essential data to ensure that in the event of a hd failure, you will be able to replace the drive, install the os and restore all your missing data. backing up to the only drive in that machine means that when the hd fails, all your essential data goes with it. note that i said when you hard drive fails, there is not if. transfer all your essential data, pictures, documents, tunes, etc. to dvd's or cd's before you start this process. all your data is about to be destroyed and wiped off the face of the hd. do not bother transferring any of your programs (applications) to dvd/cd, as you will be able to reinstall these once the os is installed. of course, all the software that came with the machine will be replaced by the restore process. let us know when you have done the backup and have the disks that came with the computer, in hand. p
