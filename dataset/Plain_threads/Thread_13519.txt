(you get the picture??) it's no wonder that device drivers don't know how to drive (smurk..smurk)! let's face it... some driver programmers can't program worth a squat...and you know who you are!!! this is especially true for that cute little mouse that wags a tail every time you double-click!!! viruses aside, device drivers have just got to be the single most cause of crashes there is. you can't really expect that grunt programmer to know all there it to know about proper use of stacks and all that other technical stuff of clean memory management. why do you think there are a thousandgazillion memory managers out there. why do you think there are a milliongazillion registry and other file cleaners out there!!! &gt;&gt;&gt; checking my blood pressure &lt;&lt;&lt; windows xp has (what is it now??) over 60 million lines of code?? security holes aside... you expect that structure to be perfect??? haaa! remember.. an operating system (xp) is supposed to keep all those drivers driving down the right path at the right time, behaving the right way so they do the right thing. i don't think so!!! what do you think! (i'm outta here!!!)
