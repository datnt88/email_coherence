after trying a huge variety of tactics to bring file & printer sharing to functionality again, i finally stumbled onto the fact that windows firewall was interfering, and cutting off the connection requests. the firewall log confirmed this. i double-checked, and &quot;file and printer sharing&quot; was indeed still one of the elements listed under the exceptions tab. not wanting to leave the firewall disabled, i started poking around for solutions. finally i got it to work by editing the &quot;file and printer sharing&quot; exception under windows firewall options, and changing the scope from &quot;my network (subnet) only&quot; to &quot;custom&quot; and entering the ip addresses of all the computers on the network. i saved this, and it windows firewall stopped dropping the other computers' connection requests. here is a portion of the firewall log: #version: 1.5 #software: microsoft windows firewall #time format: local #fields: date time action protocol src-ip dst-ip src-port dst-port size tcpflags tcpsyn tcpack tcpwin icmptype icmpcode info path 2009-12-17 16:40:12 drop tcp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.4 1455 139 52 s 2262078089 0 65535 - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:40:18 drop tcp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.4 1455 139 52 s 2262078089 0 65535 - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:41:08 open tcp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 139 1453 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 16:41:18 close tcp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 139 1453 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 16:43:19 drop udp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.255 138 138 235 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:43:21 drop udp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.255 138 138 235 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:46:07 drop udp 192.168.1.7 192.168.1.255 138 138 229 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:47:50 drop udp 192.168.1.7 192.168.1.255 138 138 234 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:48:10 drop udp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.255 138 138 202 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:55:45 drop udp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.255 137 137 78 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:58:08 drop udp 192.168.1.7 192.168.1.255 138 138 229 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:58:21 drop udp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.255 138 138 235 - - - - - - - receive 2009-12-17 16:59:25 open udp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 137 137 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 16:59:25 open-inbound tcp 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.4 1506 139 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 17:00:43 close udp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 137 137 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 17:07:32 open udp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 137 137 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 17:07:34 open tcp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 1273 139 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 17:07:34 open tcp 192.168.0.3 192.168.0.1 1274 139 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 17:07:34 open tcp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 1275 445 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 17:07:34 open tcp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 1276 139 - - - - - - - - - 2009-12-17 17:07:34 close tcp 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5 1276 139 - - - - - - - - - incidentally, after typing in the ip addresses normally and saving it, they were changed to the following format: 192.168.1.5/255.255.255.255. i'm not sure if the last part is supposed to be the subnet mask (for which we're using 255.255.255.0) but it works - and 255.255.255.0 doesn't. which could explain why the &quot;my network (subnet) only&quot; option stopped working - i just don't know why ics would cause such a change. is there anyone out there that can tell us?
