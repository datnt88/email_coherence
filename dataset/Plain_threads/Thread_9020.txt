(i think i've officially entered the nit-picky phase of selection). thanks, jay

14148	8	104825	1218755	1205449	juleslt	6/1/05 1:37 am	1.11758982e12	20 display	i'm sat here using a mere macmini with 512mb ram and a 20'' cinema display, and for the majority of what i actually do with my machine, it is more than adequate. while it is almost certainly slower and less slick than any g5 based machine, performance feels better than the pc in the other room with a roughly similar spec (512mb, 1.3mhz cpu). then again, i've sussed that most of my wife and i's pc usage is very light, hence going for a mac mini rather than something with a top end graphics card. i am not heavily using photoshop (and when i do, i am not usually working at photo quality), and i haven't started heavily using imovie, garageband or idvd. the first time i hit the constraints of the machine was using garageband, but i was testing how much i could do before it gave up (and that was cpu rather than memory). simcity didn't seem to enjoy running at the highest resolution - i've not done any investigation there, my hunch is that it graphics card as 32mb is the bare minimum suggested. if you do a lot of photoshop work or a/v editing, then the more ram the better.
