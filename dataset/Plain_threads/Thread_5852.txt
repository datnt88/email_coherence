(the reason is complicated and has to do with online backup and comcast bandwidth caps.) all of my computers are on one network, except for one mac that has all my photos and videos. i would like to plug a drobo in to that mac for backup purposes and then use the droboshare to share those files to all the other computers (on a different network) and allow other computers to back up to the drobo. the connection to the mac, which is the one on the different network, would be a direct firewire/usb connection. the various computers are windows, mac, and linux. is this possible with a drobo? thanks!
