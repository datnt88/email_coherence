(you can't mix both at the same time obviously). i have two sticks of ddrii in the appropriate two slots (1gb each), and this is what happens. i put in one stick in slot 1, and it boots up fine...take that stick out and put it into slot 3, and it boots up fine. i take the other stick and do the same to it after removing the first stick, and it boots up fine both times. if i put both sticks in at the same time, it refuses to boot up and acts stupid as all get out. i've looked all over the place in the mobo manual and there is nothing to indicate this shouldn't work, since i've tested two sticks of ddr ram at the same time and had no problems with that...only the ddrii. the sticks are identical, both in size and vendor, and since they both work fine as a single mode no matter where i put them, i'm stumped. any suggestions? this is for a computer that i am selling and have to box up by wednesday to ship it out and i would like to get this resolved as quickly as possible. the sticks are about a year old, if that, and had been kept in their silver envelopes the entire time until i was ready to build this system. they've never been installed in anything else because this mobo is the only one i have that takes ddrii ram. thanks for any help or suggestions...... toni h

9275	4	356827	3115743	3115604	toni h	8/31/09 1:11 am	1.25168106e12	my manual also	states 2gb which was why i was wondering if the total being 2048mb according to the bios for one stick at 1024mb was making it go over the limit and refusing to see the second stick. rather than fight this, i think my best bet is to just go out and buy one stick of 2gb from my local computer shop today...i can sell the 1gb sticks on ebay one at a time and recoup my money. lol thanks..........

9275	7	356827	3115860	3115837	toni h	8/31/09 5:33 am	1.25169678e12	i was hoping	that program might provide an answer but after checking the site i discovered that although it will run from a flash drive or dvd/cd, you have to have an operating system (windows) installed already and i'm not including that with this system, so it's got an empty harddrive. darn the only voltage setting i have available in the bios p1.150 version is auto/high/medium/low....no 'number' setting where i could bump it gently. according to asrock's tech support site, the voltage for ddr2 is 1.8 and i can't tell from my options which that would be. the manual doesn't give much details for bios changes like other mobo manuals normally do. since ram is cheap now, i'll just get one stick of 2gb and try that instead. i have no other systems that take ddr2 ram, so have no other pairs to try. thanks for the suggestions. toni h
9275	8	356827	3115921	3115860	willy	8/31/09 6:47 am	1.25170122e12	wait a sec.	i re-read your 1st post. you say, slot 1 and 3 are used. that means you really have 4 slots??? or 2 slots in total. quite frankly, how can you boot-up with one ram stick installed, it has to be failing if no os present or stops upon finding none. i think something is amiss here, imho. otherwise, i would think you had windoze installed and thus use pc wiz 2009 to check things. if you have 4 slots, my thinking is your system supports a total of 2gb, then that means 512mb per slot. while it can handle 1gb installed(1 ram stick), it may not cover the difference when 2gb ram sticks are used(a bios update may cover this). if in fact you have only 2 ram slots period then disregard this info. the mere fact, that asrock offers only slow/med/fast adjustment to ram gives you an idea what i mean by cheap. better mtrbds. offer manual values directly to include actual voltages. not to belittle you, but i think you see my bewilderment here. anyways, good luck. -----willy
9275	9	356827	3115909	3115921	toni h	8/31/09 7:04 am	1.25170224e12	slots	there are two yellow slots for ddr2 and two blue slots for ddr ram. you can put one stick in either of the two yellow slots (slot1 and 3) as single mode and have the computer boot up. you can put two sticks in those slots and have dual channel mode. this works for the blue slots as well. if i put ddr ram into the two blue slots, it boots up fine...it's only the ddr2 (yellow slots) that gets whacked for some reason. hope this explains it better. this is the last computer i will be building for sale so i know not to go with the asrock mobo anymore. give me a reliable abit or gigabyte any day of the week. lol toni h
