15228	3	267757	2605807	2605501	ozos	10/13/07 9:40 am	1.1922684e12	wow, lots of problems	and wherea re oyu getting these prices, its so expensive firstly: look at intel's core 2 duo line, and amd's athlon64 x2, you dont need fx (and it doesnt get you much, unless you're buying the dsdc set, the dsdc setup would increase fps in supcom) secondly, sli, worthless, get the 8800gtx single, install it, and forget about it, you dont need sli (it wont help much with supcomm) thirdly, ram kit just means you get 2 or 4 sticks of ram in one package, vs buying each individually, do not get 4gb of ram, windows xp and vista 32-bit won't even see part of it, and while vista x64 can see all of it, nothing can make use of it (its a waste of cash, is what i'm getting at), if you want a lot of ram, get a 2x1gb kit and a 2x512mb kit and run 3gb of ram in dual channel, it'll save you the money on buying another gb, and it'll be usable the money you're spending on that optical drive is obscene, look at basically any other brand of dvd burner, it'll cost about $35, lite-on and nec are both great, so is lg i'd look at an entirely different psu, as the one you've selected doesn't inspire confidence, check out companies that are revered for their psus, not their calculators, such as corsair, seasonic tech, silverstone, pc power & cooling, enermax, etc if you still want sli for whatever reason, 850w is skimpy, i'd look at a different case with sli too, try silverstone, lian-li, or antec (you need more airflow), and 850-1000w of psu from a reputable, known psu maker honestly, the kb/mouse aren't worth the $100, you dont need &quot;gaming hardware&quot; just to game, if you want a fast response mouse, check out the intellimouse explorer 3.0 from ms, should run you about $35, just as capable as the logitech, but none of the built up hype, hence cheaper (even razer's mice are cheaper) check  you should be able to do a whole system with a 500gb hd (they only cost about $95) for under $1500

15228	6	267757	2612128	2612086	vapcmd	10/21/07 9:45 pm	1.1930031e12	more research and analysis required or you	won't get the best bang for the gamimg buck. cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 $210 (which one ???) -as per suggestion. still recommend intel c2d as cpu ....clearly the cpu of choice for today's pc. motherboard: asus m2n32-sli deluxe $140 -made a decision and picked this one instead of the crossfire. still recommend mb for intel platform such as the abit ip35 pro  $159.99 after $20 rebate ram: ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2x1 gig (a-data $28x2= $56) and 2x512 mb (wintec $20x2= $40). -as per suggestion. personally i'd buy the 4gb now and decide how to best use it afterwards. believe you can use it all with the 64bit version of windows. it's unbelievably cheap today. hard-drive: western digital wd1600ys 160gb 7200 rpm sata 3.0 gb/s, 16mb cache. $60. -still not wanting space as much as speed. i wanted something with higher rpm, but i wasn't sure if sata 150 was compatible with the motherboard, so i went for this. for peanuts more you can get a 320gb or 400gb sata see here  psu: coolmax ctg-850 atx 12v 850w. $230 -i tried to find one under the manufacturers that was recommended, but they didn't have anything on newegg.com that was near the wattage i wanted. i think this one has all the cables i'll need, but i'll research it more later on. ******read here for best info re psus . . .  and then check newegg.com again . .they've got psus from 100w to 1200w and prices with shipping are usually quite competitive. and by all means ...read the buyer comments...they're usually quite helpful and informative and helpful. vapcmd

15228	8	267757	2614343	2614365	vapcmd	10/24/07 7:26 pm	1.19325396e12	ok...	one more thing... might be better with two hdds than just one. here's why .... drive 0 serves as space for your os and apps (c:) with a second partition for data (d:). drive 1 is also installed internally and serves as an easy, fast back up (and restore) for the main hdd. one big hdd .. if it dies you're toast and have no backup. with two hdds you've got some redundancy and not likely that both drive could fail simultaneously. virus infected yes...fail unlikely. vapcmd
15228	9	267757	3013329	2605484	ndemko	3/28/09 2:10 pm	1.2382494e12	do not buy from cyberpower pc	when looking for a gaming pc for my son, i relied on the reviews from pc world to select cyperpower pc ( . they have been horrible. we purchased two pcs -- one for $3,500, one for over $5k. the $5k pc arrived and wouldn't stay on for over 1 minute before overheating. we went back and forth and finally were issued a full refund. the cheaper pc ($3.5k) has been returned -- the motherboard went out after eight months. customer service is non-existent. you will be on hold for hours. trying email is a joke. after about a month of communications trying to honor the warranty on the motherboard, we did receive the pc back with a new motherboard. today, we discovered that the pc won't turn on. power is getting to the pc, but it won't start. we've been on hold to technical support with cyperpower pc for hours. do not purchase a pc from these people. it is a joke. it is a shame that pc world would have rated them so highly.
