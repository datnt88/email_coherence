7882	6	558445	5287134	5287086	islandporgy	3/15/12 6:19 pm	1.33183554e12	did that	i did that and western digital did that the serial # do not match the specs on the hard drive that was sent to me. the serial # matched on what i ordered not what was sent to me. i got two different statement confumation emails. before i opened up the hard drive plastic casing i called western digital because if it was not what i ordered i would have sent it back i do not care what is on the lable. the software puriform speccy says something way diferent. it is not oem i do not know what it is.the vender might have decieved me not the mfgs. thank you wendell
