(norton is on desktop pc!) not on netbook!&quot; never run two active antivirus programs at the same time. otherwise, having an erratic mouse can wind up to be the least of your problems. system slowdown is an often noted symptom as well, system freezes are seen as well. remove one, and see how things are:
