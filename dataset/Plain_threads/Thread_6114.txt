366	5	137341	1554830	1552777	rjla	11/22/05 7:45 pm	1.1326887e12	encryption handles this problem	bob, i think you missed the encryption portion. the iphantom uses aes encryption to encrypt all of the data between the iphantom and the gateways. this would prevent any logging by the isp unless they can decrypt 256-bit aes encryption. i don't see why you would think this is a sham.

366	7	137341	1568494	1555764	rjla	11/28/05 9:08 pm	1.13321208e12	missing the point	i still think you are missing the point. besides the encryption, the iphantom provides the easiest gateway antivirus, spyware, adware, network intrusion prevention that i have ever used. coupling it with my software antivirus gives me all around protection. as far as the encryption part, i know from talking to them that each device is programmed with a unique key. besides making my data private, it keeps data sniffers and other people from communicating directly with my broadband connection. and they manage all of that for me. if you look at the big picutre, it is worth it. if you've ever dealt with gateway protection (antivirus, etc.) you'd know its expensive and can be complicated. i do network security administration and at first was skeptical like you were. i tried it and was happy to find that it actually works.

366	9	137341	1568612	1568592	rjla	11/28/05 10:46 pm	1.13321796e12	still missing the point	i don't know if you read the entire previous post, i was talking about the other aspects of the product and how the encryption is a vital part of it. using encryption between your connection and their gateways provides a prefiltered line that has all of the gateway security applied to it. this prevents anyone from communicating directly with your network connection and allows you to get gateway antivirus, spyware, intrusion protection, etc without all of the hassles with a simple setup. i still don't see how you can claim that this doesn't make sense especially if you do design in the networking related field. i can tell from your original posts that you hadn't even looked at the product based on what you posted. giving advice on something you haven't researched is misleading and is the opposite of helpful for people looking for information. i guess we can go back and forth on this, but having managed gateway protection at the price they offer is a great deal as i know what this costs.

366	11	137341	1568664	1568622	rjla	11/28/05 11:26 pm	1.13322036e12	your advice is incomplete	i am a network administrator in the business. my argument for the last few posts had to do with network security (gateway antivirus protection, antispyware, network intrusion protection, etc.) what does this have to do with the federal gov? the only thing it does have to do with them is that they use similar protection on their networks as do large companies for a high price. there are other companies, like prolexic, that provide similar types of service but for thousands of dollars. the concept has been extended for the smb and home. as far as probing and tapping goes, i'd rather have an encrypted connection than nothing at all.

366	14	137341	1568698	1568684	rjla	11/29/05 12:11 am	1.13322306e12	let's be blunt.	i just don't see how you can claim that the only purpose of a device like this is to be anonymous. i know other businesses using it besides myself. and no one on their network or mine download anything on p2p. no matter what i say, you like to circle around to conspiracy theory and 1 aspect of the device. there is much more to it than p2p downloading. i just don't think you'll ever understand that.

366	20	137341	1587746	1570815	superhifi	12/7/05 7:39 pm	1.13398434e12	according to bob, lets do nothing?	bob, you are suggesting that because this does not protect against viruses brought in by a cd that it is over kill? what planet are you on. did you ever think this plus a software antivirus is key. is this not what is done at almost every large corporation. total lock down? yes, do all you can to prevent. your mentality is so far out, you suggest that to much protection is lock down. remember, you should already have software antivirus, this is seemless and run on the back end with no software. why not. bob, you just have nothing better so say. you have not recommended something better than a combination of software and hardware antivirus. all you can say is the sky is falling. do you just do this to post something to remain as a moderator as you have no suggestions?
