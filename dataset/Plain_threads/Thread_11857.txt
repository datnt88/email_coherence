(raid 0 is striping, which is faster but without redundancy and with a greater chance of failure.) bob's workaround is, in essence, backup; this does have some advantages. a major disadvantage, however, is that backups take time. if i were going that route i would, as bob recommends, choose acronis true image. to save time, those important things needing frequent backup -- mainly data & documents -- in a separate partition, and then do partition imaging. imho, the same idea applies to a raid 1 system. in my case the single c drive contains the os, program files, relatively unimportant data, and other items that do not change frequently. this drive is backed up only as needed. my d drive, which is a pair of drives i raid 1 configuration, gets the more important and changable data. hope this helps frank
