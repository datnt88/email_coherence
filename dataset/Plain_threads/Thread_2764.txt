5272	0	405778	3355854	nr	theimpossible	8/11/10 8:51 am	1.28151666e12	hard disk disables dvd-rom!	i have a weird/funny problem with my seagate 80 gb hard disk (non-sata). whenever i try to boot windows installed on it, i get the windows advanced options screen (start in safe mode, safe mode with command prompt etc.) with the message that the system was not properly shut down. whatever i option i select, windows makes a bit of an effort to move forward, but then reboots and takes me back to the same advanced options screen. to resolve this problem i decided to repair/format-and-reinstall windows when i noticed the strangest thing: my dvd-rom wouldn't work as long as i attached this particular hard disk to the computer. any other hard disk and everything is fine. the problem is not specific to my pc either; i tried the hard disk on computers of a couple of friends and it jammed their cd/dvd-roms in the same mysterious way. this clearly is a hardware problem, but i cannot imagine what on earth could cause a hard disk to affect a dvd-rom. so if you have some insight into this, please help; not just because i want to retrieve some important data from the hard disk, but also because i badly want to know the reason behind such unique problem. thanks a lot in advance, the impossible.

5272	4	405778	3355905	3355873	theimpossible	8/11/10 10:37 am	1.28152302e12	same here.	80-conductor ide cable. i am looking for for more details, if they are required. i think mine is ata66. i am also trying to figure out what do 100 and 133 mean in ata66/100/133.
