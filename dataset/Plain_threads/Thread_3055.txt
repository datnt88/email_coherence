(let's say- p3 933mhz?) 2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop. what can be the problem?

(let's say- p3 933mhz?) this is not possible. here's why. i'll use the game doom 3 as my example that no system today can play that game at it's top settings without &quot;stuck&quot; or a pause now and then. the game was designed to push the envelope and to take advantage of hardware yet to be. 2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop. what can be the problem? i'd say the cause can be either a poor installation or a power supply that is on the edges of the maximum that it can supply. bob

6427	13	39817	470357	466551	unknown	10/8/04 6:46 am	1.09721796e12	re: ram vs processor + a screen gone crazy	1) i recommend upgrading both ram and cpu, but if cash is short, do the cpu upgrade first. personally, i have a duron 1.3 ghz cpu, and 640 mb ram (128 + 512) and i still need more ram and processor speed. however, until you do upgrade your hardware, you can boost your ram by adjusting windows's paging file. sure, it consumes some of your hdd, but it will work, until the upgrade is done. 2) my guess is that your power source does not produce enough watts to satisfy all the needs of your system. sure, it is ok without fan, but the moment you plug it in, you add another power consumer and it can't take it. so, it cuts down on the power supplied to the monitor, to keep the fan, motherboard, cpu, and hdd running. my advice ? get a newer motherboard and power source. a 400w power source should do the trick.
6427	14	39817	470415	466551	percy	10/8/04 7:14 am	1.09721964e12	re: ram vs processor + a screen gone crazy	its a toss-up. upgrading the processor may require a new motherboard and power supply. adding ram would be less expensive and may improve performance. if your not looking at gaming, and if your not trying to run memory intensive programs(autocad and such), i would look at other factors. 256mb of ram in most systems is going to perform quite well. (i run a computer lab at a major university, and have 20 of the systems described) cleaning up the drive , ensuring that there is plenty of virtual memory available, removing spy-ware and of course having a good viruscan program and autoscheduling of updates(all) should help. as for the fan, if it connects to the motherboard, it may be drawing to much current, or it may be faulty. i would try another fan, and if the same results, have the power supply checked.

[bcoz ihave 2.8 ht p 4 {256 mb ram} & my pc is smooth to both the game & softwares.] but if graphics comes in ur software then 512 mb ram will make a difference. ans2: ur screen gone unstable most probably by the magnatic field of ur fan or some thing like that.i'm assuming that u connact ur fan to any border of ur moniter's body. but if not so then it is tough for me ans 2nd one.
