10467	0	111579	1267961	nr	wahnula	6/27/05 9:51 pm	1.11990906e12	ok, i've decided to build a new server..	...to replace the nt 4.0 dinosaur that sensei proffit has helped me keep alive. specs: pentium pro200(two of them) 512k edo ram, running windows nt, microsoft backoffice server and microsoft exchange to provide a smooth running, reliable machine that works 24/7 on our small, 8-workstation network. we get around the 5-user thing with exchange 'cause not all 8 folks are in the office at the same time. i want to upgrade the machine, that part i can handle. i'll use win2k,(maybe xp but i don't see alot of difference) a pentium d or ht 3.0 ghz, intel mobo, 2 sata 36gb raptors striped and at least 2gb of ram. backup will be veritas be 9.1 daily to tape, sony scsi 11000. so, how do i ''move in'' to the new machine? should i use the nt scopy feature then upgrade the os, or should i start from scratch and install win2000, microsoft backoffice and microsft exchange then just drag and drop the appropriate folders? what would you do? thanks! tony
