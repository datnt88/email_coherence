7627	8	557277	5281078	5281042	coryphaeus	3/1/12 12:37 pm	1.33060542e12	please let me simplify this . . .	your download speed is dictated by your isp and the bottlenecks that bob mentioned. period. my cisco cable modem is docsis-3 and is rated at gigabit output speed as is my d-link router. my cable speed is 15 megabits/second. what do you think my download speed is? my wireless n is rated at 54 mb/s. what speed do you think i get? both questions, i get 15 mb/s on a good day, usually slower because of those accursed bottlenecks. in other words, you get what your isp provides. now, on my home network, between devices, i get blistering speeds.
