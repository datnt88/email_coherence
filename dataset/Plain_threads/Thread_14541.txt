13513	5	64065	1449945	1449880	bknowledge	9/30/05 11:39 am	1.12808034e12	go with the flow!	you already use d-link with no problems so just get their extender. you may be upgrading to n in just over a year so why invest in new equipment now to change later. but look into the free stuff because you can't beat free! in the end the choice is yours.
13513	6	64065	1450080	760578	linkit	9/30/05 12:48 pm	1.12808448e12	my options list	- use a freeantennas.com alteration - install a higher gain antenna on current router - add a range extender/expander - add a wireless access point (requires running one network cable) - replace router with pre-n router - install firmware that will boost signal - connect two wireless routers using wds capable firmware the last two options depend on availability of 3rd party firmware for your current model. personal experience: linksys wireless-g range expander (wre54g) is a real pain to deal with--not recommended.
