6904	3	564706	5318822	5318790	vapcmd	6/4/12 9:19 am	1.33880154e12	the question is how important is the data and availability	of the system that supports it ? does the system store only family pics, tax records or is it used for business and earning a living too ? the question is ... what level of redundancy and backup are you looking for ? what if the system was hit by voltage spikes, lightning,flood, tornado, etc., ? raid 5 and having a spare hdd is great but but you may need to think beyond that if you want ensure system availability, data access and continuity of business. vapcmd
