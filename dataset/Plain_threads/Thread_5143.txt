(personally, i've never been a fan of epson printer quality, though.) for hp, cannon, and lexmark, though, such devices or software packages are often difficult to find and, in truth, frequently scams. the little 'tricks' of covering specific contacts on the ink cartridge before reinserting in a certain pattern haven't failed me yet. however, the 'tricks' still do not enable you to use a cartridge past its expiration date. john
