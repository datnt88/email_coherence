3346	4	249477	2497182	2496857	tokimemofan	5/26/07 4:35 pm	1.1801973e12	it all works	i tested the hardware already. how else would i know about the low cmos battery on one of the motherboards. i also loaded an os and played some audio cds on the sound cards. spent over a week testing everything and except for the battery it all works.
