(  ) 3. 250g sata hard drive 4. sata dvd burner 5. additional 1 gb ram (cumulative ram = 2gb) apart from the peripheral components (monitor, keyboard, mouse), am i missing anything? (don't require video/sound cards). the total cost for the machine is roughly $700. please suggest. thanks!

(assume no external devices attached to the tower except keyboard, mouse)
