639	3	336384	3011352	3011303	tivoboxboy	3/25/09 5:32 pm	1.23800232e12	i read this link	and it seems to caution against ntfs because: * data cannot easily be recovered * file system structure cannot be manually checked and repaired * malware cannot be scanned for and cleaned
639	4	336384	3011370	3011257	r. proffitt	3/25/09 5:37 pm	1.23800262e12	fat32 is very compatible yet too dangerous.	every week i have someone at the office show up with a corrupted fat32 volume. it's too prone to damage. just do this. copy a file to it and then yank the usb cord. our ntfs volumes survive and i can kill the fat32 volumes on demand. yes we can format them and start over but where's the fun in that? bob
639	5	336384	3011379	3011370	tivoboxboy	3/25/09 5:52 pm	1.23800352e12	why would the	formatting have an effect on how stable the data is? is this just your experience or is this because of the new technology of ntfs?
639	6	336384	3011462	3011379	r. proffitt	3/25/09 8:09 pm	1.23801174e12	in a nutshell.	i leave it to you to research file systems but let's highlight the basic issue. ntfs is damage resistant (not damage proof.) fat32 is very compatible but suffers from not having any resiliency to most damage. hey, it's your choice here. i will not spend 20 posts telling you all the reasons and duplicating web pages. how important is your data and your time? bob
