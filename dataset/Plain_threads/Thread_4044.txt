7765	7	53552	643668	643248	toohotruk	12/29/04 4:59 pm	1.10433954e12	thanks...	i think i will roll the dice on this one, it sounds pretty straightforward and i'm in the process of backing everything up right now, so i will be about as prepared as i can be. hopefully, by this time tomorrow i'll have everything working properly on the new(er) pc! it's a lot more reassuring to have good folks like you to give me advice than when i just try things on my own, hoping they will work out. of course, i will probably still do some things on my own and when i mess things up, i'll be back for more help, lol!
7765	8	53552	644115	639958	toohotruk	12/29/04 9:23 pm	1.10435538e12	password...	ok, i put the 60g drive into the ibm, booted from the xp setup cd, selected the repair feature, selected the drive (c) to repair, but it needs an &quot;administrator password&quot; to continue. i tried the one that i use to logon to windows, i tried various others, such as &quot;11111,&quot; &quot;12345,&quot; &quot;00000,&quot; etc. i even tried just hitting &quot;enter&quot; but i can't get past that point. so i put the drive back in the sony and thankfully, it still works and here i am! is there a default administrator password, or a way to bypass it somehow? i even went into bios and reset the 2 passwords (1 &quot;supervisor,&quot; 1 &quot;user&quot;) that are in there, but that made no difference. this is very frustrating!

7765	10	53552	645956	644445	toohotruk	12/30/04 3:46 pm	1.10442156e12	not oem...	no, i bought the full home version of xp about a year ago (at staples, i think) and installed it on a brand new maxtor 60g hard drive that i put in my sony vaio. i had the understanding that as long as i was just upgrading to a newer machine and i used the same hard drive from the old pc and the old machine would not have that same version of xp, it would not violate the license agreement. of course, i could be wrong about that though. i don't even plan to use the vaio for anything but parts, in fact, it won't even have a hard drive once i get this problem worked out. i hope that doesn't violate the agreement, because it doesn't seem fair to me that i paid around $250 for the full version of xp and a year later, i have the oportunity to put a better pc together using the same drive that version of xp was originally installed on and i may be expected to shell out another $250 (or more) for another new os. i think if that's the case, i'll save my money and get a mac, just so i'm not putting anymore money in bill gates' pocket! if i have to buy another os, that will put the total for this little project almost high enough that i could have just bought a brand new pc that would be much better anyway. i'll check out those articles you posted and see if they will help, if not, i guess i'll just have to break down and call microsoft and see if they can help me get it worked out. the problem with that is, i understand that they charge something like $35 for that call and that doesn't neccessarily guarantee the problem will get solved. i really don't have the money to do that, that's why i came here for help instead. i just had a thought...is there a chance that the password it's asking for is actually the product key code that comes with the windows disk? maybe i'll give that a shot, i've got nothing to lose but the time it will take to do it. anyway, i really do appreciate the help you have given me, it's very nice of you to take the time to help somebody else out like that, thanks.

7765	12	53552	704695	646325	toohotruk	1/21/05 11:58 pm	1.10635188e12	just an update...	i've been meaning to post an update on here, but just haven't been able to find the time until now. i wound up calling microsoft tech support and they told me that they weren't even sure if what i wanted to do would even work. they suggested uninstalling xp sp2 and all the other updates, as well as my norton internet security and norton system works then trying the transfer, but there was no guarantee that it would work after all that and i still might wind up losing some data. so what i decided to do, is activate xp on the 30g drive in the ibm, then just run a restore on my backup (12 cds) into that drive and then do a wipe on the 60g drive and use it as the slave. this worked quite well, it was a bit time consuming, but well worth it! i am now on the ibm, i now have a piii processor, 384 mgs of sdram, the 30g drive as the primary and the 60 for storage. it has a built-in dvd rom as well as a built-in cd writer, which is nice, since with my old setup, i had an external cd writer. this is a vast improvment over my old system with the pii! and i only spent slightly over $200 in the process...not bad for a stupid plumber, eh? lol! the best part about doing the transfer the way i did, is that i was never down, i always had a functioning pc to access the internet (2 of them at one point!), which is good, because i sell on ebay and can't afford to be down for very long! in fact, that's what worried me the most, if something went wrong, i would have to go down to the local public library and use the public pcs to take care of business on ebay. that idea just doesn't sound good to me for some reason, lol! anyway, i just thought i'd let those that took the time to post and give me advice know that it all turned out well in the end and i really appreciate the help you gave me, thanks!!! scott
