3565	4	64497	767966	767778	tony m	2/16/05 6:19 am	1.10853474e12	admin password needed	the drive reads the disk and it shows on the desktop, but when i try to intstall os x it asks for my admin password. when i try and boot from the disk it sounds like it's reading the disk, but the os x login screen always appears. i can't understand why it will not boot from a disk because even if i did know my root password it is still not letting me boot from the disk. i know the disk works because i installed os x on my home g4 tower from this disk. is there no software available that will delete the hdd? after all i'm not trying to access password protected files, i'm just deleting them right??
3565	5	64497	768912	767966	mrmacfixit	2/16/05 11:28 am	1.10855328e12	wrong	part of the strength of os x is that its core, and a bunch of other places, is protected against what you are trying to do to it. this is one of the many reasons that there are currently no virus's for os x. to delete the files you have to have access to them and have the rights to read/write and delete. you are going to have to boot from the cd to install os x so i would not be too quick to blow away the hd. the os x installer will not install to the drive that it is mounted on. i would continue my efforts to boot from the cd. have you tried inserting the cd, mounting it on the desktop, going to system preferences, choosing the cd as the startup disk and then restarting?? if not, try it. you are going to have to boot from the cd eventually. (see above) p

3565	7	64497	771975	771048	mrmacfixit	2/17/05 4:52 pm	1.10865912e12	software	i know of no software that will over ride the administrators password. that does not mean that it does not exist though. i will keep banging the &quot;you gotta boot from the cd&quot; drum though. once you get your brand new, virgin, hd, how do you propose to get the os onto it? to install os x onto the new hd, you will have to boot from the cd. you can only boot from a cd that has the correct operating system for your machine. however, your machine should boot from the original panther cd's. you said you had the panther disks, the three black ones? does the machine boot from any cd? p
3565	8	64497	772549	771975	tony m	2/18/05 1:34 am	1.10869044e12	disks	yes i have the three black panther disks, it will not boot from these, nor will it boot from any other cd that i've tried so far. could it be that i'd upgraded to os x 3.5 before i lost my root password and the machine will not boot from these disk as they are only 3.3? should i try getting a later version of os panther to see if that works? the thing i can't understand is that my home desktop g4 runs on os x 3.3 and i can boot from any disk on that machine. could i have turned my powerbook's &quot;option to boot from a cd&quot; off in anyway? or perrhaps the powerbook needs to be running in single user (root) mode to be able to boot from a disk?
3565	9	64497	772798	772549	mrmacfixit	2/18/05 5:00 am	1.1087028e12	boot	panther only comes in one flavor on a cd. you have to update from there. unless the cdrom drive is faulty, i don't think there is any reason why it would not boot from the install disks. this might be worth biting the bullet and speaking with apple.
