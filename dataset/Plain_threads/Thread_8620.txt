(just as a reference, any standard platter hard drive has to correct itself hundreds of times a second. this requires the processor to work constantly. this on top of the use of the operating system, background apps (wifi connections, security suite, sound and video processing) will tend to add up. for the best computing experience i suggest the faster computer. question: when in that range of netbooks does the screen size difference (1 inch between a 10&quot; and an 11&quot;) really make a noticeable difference in long term computing experience?
