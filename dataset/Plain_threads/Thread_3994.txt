1270	8	206041	2205456	2205386	r. proffitt	9/14/06 7:44 pm	1.15826304e12	never seen that work with xp. multiple reasons why.	1. windows xp activation kicks in and since the os is not on a emachines board, fails. no big surprise here. the license was for the emachine and it's not an emachine any more. 2. the repairs for xp i noted are for most oem (not brand names) and retail versions of xp. in the future be sure to reveal the details so we can make faster progress. i think finding a new emachine board could be the cheap fix here. bob
