383	2	58809	698496	698368	ieatfish	1/19/05 4:39 pm	1.10615274e12	well...	i just noticed that this is the desktop forum, oops (my computer is a notebook) but i doubt this problem is limited to notebooks. i really have no idea what is going on, and haven't tinkered around too much yet, but i was just posting to see if anyone else had had the same problem. i think it is probably a setting in another program., but like i said, haven't given much time to it yet.

383	4	58809	699014	698547	ieatfish	1/19/05 9:19 pm	1.10616954e12	found it	well, i don't know if it was the problem, but i noticed that when i changed the color depth, my winamp skin also changed, so i have changed the skin and now all seems to be working fine. thanks all.
