(usually application that ends in .exe) p

5137	10	247025	2484604	2484587	boya84	5/11/07 8:41 pm	1.17891606e12	read through the grphics information	i believe you will find that the 64 meg is built-in - but also uses system memory as needed. mrmacfixit - you opinion?

(parallels or vmware) boot camp is ok for all versions though, it is not a virtual environment. p
