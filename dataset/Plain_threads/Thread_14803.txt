5532	4	565023	5320474	5320373	padyboy	6/8/12 1:01 pm	1.33916046e12	reply	thank you for your reply. you seem to be suggesting that major renovations would be required to install another hd on my pavilion computer. perhaps buying a new computer would solve the problem, but i cannot afford that. i understood when i bought this computer the future limitations. the sales rep admitted this computer would be obsolete in 2 years i thought having 2 unused sata sockets on the motherboard might make this possible. also chucking my present 750gb storage drive is an unlikely action. i guess i need something like 2 tb, which are really expensive, and would still require increased cooling capability. it appears i have reached the limit with my present desktop computer. perhaps i should consider an external storage drive with the slower data transfer rates. oh. and i forgot that my lacie backup drive is 1tb. so there is more than one investment here. thank you for the information.
5532	5	565023	5320535	5320474	willy	6/8/12 3:01 pm	1.33916766e12	pc setup	i'm informing you that adding more to this oem type pc will start to make it more stressful. even, after all is aid and done it should work, it maybe on a limited(sooner or latter) start to falter. that pc was build to be the model# is and only a little room to grow on. once you start to burden it, it becomes less capable even though the os and immediate usage should be ok. it's the long run prospects that will become evident. other considerations like cooling and power should also be included as i posted earlier. its not that you can't probably add a another hd, it's the overall final pc and its continued use. good luck tada -----willy
