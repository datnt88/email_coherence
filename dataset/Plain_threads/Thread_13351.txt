1124	4	141413	1587209	1586699	willy	12/7/05 2:53 pm	1.13396718e12	quick checks	ok, sorry for no restore points. anyways, besides an actual audio card, there are audio section build on mtrbds. i suggest you get the system checker:  find everest system checker pgm. and d/l it. it will check your system for all devices. yes, the audio portion will be seen as pci type. if present. a quick physical check of the audio ports found on the system case, look for 3-4 small rca plug-ins, maybe labeled as spkr, input, output and/or mic, etc. tada -----willy

1124	8	141413	1589308	1588764	bob b	12/8/05 1:31 pm	1.13404866e12	i think..	if you do what willy said with the everest thing you'll get so much info about your machine it will make you dizzy. somewhere in the mass of info it presents will be the make/model/serial# etc.etc. of the mobo.
