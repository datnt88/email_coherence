14283	8	325539	2954290	2954244	wgrayson	1/16/09 2:45 pm	1.2321171e12	netbook the reason for win7?	that's probably a good secondary objective, touchy-feely netbooks. and to be honest, 75% of what i really do can be performed on a netbook. but we know the real reason for win7 --- maybe everyone will forget about vista. and just my luck. i was one of the boobs that bought a pc when windowsme was launched too, and i went and did the same thing with vista. you would think i would have learned my lesson by now.
