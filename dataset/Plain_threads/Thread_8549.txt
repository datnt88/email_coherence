(just a high end video card will eat up $500+, and heavens to betsy if you go with a 10,000 rpm hard drive, high end cpu/mobo,& ram.) the main guts for a gaming pc is the video card, ram, and cpu. it is a matter of going thru with each company trying to get the best cpu/motherboard, then video card, and ram. sometimes you can skimp on the video card and ram getting a less powerful one when configuring with a company, keeping in mind that you can beat their prices by buying separately elsewhere, removing the lesser ones, and installing a more powerfully one yourself, and still stay within the $1000 limit (without monitor/printer). i'm off to church right now, then to watch nascar on tv, but when i get some time in a day or so, i'll see what i can scratch up for you, but suggest you take pen in hand, and with fingers roaming over your keyboard try to do it yourself.
