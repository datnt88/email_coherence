2262	12	595384	5469808	5469697	r. proffitt	6/21/13 12:32 am	1.37177472e12	restore media is free if you make it.	when we get a new computer among the first steps is to create the restore media. many of these use a restore partition. so both those are free. installing a clean copy of a retail windows is, today asking a lot of everyday users. i gave an example of a chat at hp.com but it's been days so i'm wondering why you didn't try that? if you end up ordering restore media, it costs. not as much as a windows license so it's a bargain. bob

2262	14	595384	5469911	5469895	r. proffitt	6/21/13 9:38 am	1.37180748e12	link, comment.	yes that points to a driver issue. keep in mind that if you didn't use the restore media but some other os then you often get to chat with hp what drivers and what order they need to be installed in. -&gt; but that's half the story. today we have helper applications that add support for things like enabling video ports and more. i can't guess which it is for this model, so back to hp. another strong nod to restore media. bob
