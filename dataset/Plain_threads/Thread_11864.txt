[i believe you have both 2 and 3, although it would help if you included more info as to the model numbers] sounds to me like you might have the remote computer somehow getting its internet connection through a &quot;host&quot; (your wired) computer. this is not what you need. when setting up the network make sure you have it gaining access to the internet through a &quot;residential gateway&quot;(your router). run the wizards and configuration cds included with your router and cards. this should help. if you include more info about os, models, etc. we can help you a little more. tyler
