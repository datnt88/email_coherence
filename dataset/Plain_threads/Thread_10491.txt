5544	1	237057	2422374	2422346	r. proffitt	3/6/07 8:44 am	1.17317064e12	why so much bucks in cards?	just recently we discussed and i disclosed no payoff in highend gpu cards at this link -&gt;  so at the office we use simple dual output cards (ati or nvidia) and see no speed loss during edit or rendering. we also save bucks on power consumption. just my answers to your questions. 1. is changing the output orientation from landscape to portrait a video card software issue or an xp issue, i.e. does xp sp2 support this directly? it's done with the drivers that come with said software. microsoft is not keen on driver development. 2. does this xfx card support running in a dual card configuration? from what i've read, yes. 3. should i upgrade to the 640 mb card? for video editing? i'll write no. gamers would. bob

5544	5	237057	2422656	2422555	ramarc	3/6/07 2:50 pm	1.1731926e12	re: confirm	rotation is on a different tab than the monitor selection window, but regardless of which monitor i selected, only the primary monitor rotated. again this could be due to my setup (1 widescreen with dvi, 1 4:3 with vga). still, enough folks have dual displays that you should be able to find someone who can confirm it for you.
5544	6	237057	2422718	2422656	richchrono	3/6/07 3:46 pm	1.17319596e12	found the tweak!	speaking with xfx, they said do not use the nvrotate utility. that only rotates the primary monitor. instead, using the classic nvidia control panel (not the new one), go into nview, click display settings, highlight the monitor you want to rotate, right click, then rotate. they tested that in house and said it worked.
