(i am reasonably experienced but i've never done this particular task before, and many people [and bios websites] have told me not to do it if not absolutely necessary) i guess if the power stays on it should be okay. are there any tricks to it other than reading the instructions? will a bios upgrade allow me to use bigger than 30 gb drives? (which i currently cannot use?) i have a soyo 6ba+ and a 6ba +iii. fyi, tiger direct sells 30 gb seagates for about $60. thanks fj
