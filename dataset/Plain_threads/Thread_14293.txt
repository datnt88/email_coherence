1538	2	311170	2876185	2874997	malkavian	10/7/08 11:30 am	1.223379e12	maybe	what i want is a small pc running xp pro. when it boots no one logs on to the pc, but the drive on the pc is shared to the network. the other 3 computers running xp pro need to access this shared drive. this is in a peer-to-peer network so there is no server involved. i'm trying to do this without having to put a client server environment in this really small office. they don't need the security. i was planning on not hooking a monitor to the pc and remoting in from one of the other pcs to administer the box if necessary. does this help? michael

1538	8	311170	2876502	2876295	steven haninger	10/7/08 5:37 pm	1.22340102e12	is there any reason this needs to be a pc	and not just a network attached storage drive? why waste an xp license and a good piece of hardware if you just want access to files in shares. a nas that supports windows smb will do that quite well. remote administration is a minimal chore. you need to turn it on/off, create/delete shares, add/remove users and do backups...not much more. they don't need much in the way of resources and can be quite small.
1538	9	311170	2876521	2876502	malkavian	10/7/08 5:55 pm	1.2234021e12	i have thought of that.	i have been looking into nas for this situation as well. i cannot seem to find a reliable, reasonably priced nas that will suite their needs. i have been reading a lot of reviews on different nas devices and some people love them and some hate them. wasting an xp license isn't really a problem. i have extra one at the moment and also have a licensed copy of windows 2000 that i no longer use. i'm still researching all possibilities and haven't ruled the nas out yet. i also need the system easy for them to switch to a backup incase the nas or pc dies. thanks michael
