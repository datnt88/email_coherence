1414	5	590971	5448631	5448630	r. proffitt	4/15/13 2:40 pm	1.3660368e12	the second psu is a single 53a 12v rail.	the first one was a 22a rail or about 262 watts per rail on a good day, new and at 15c. that's a recipe for a future or nearly immediate meltdown (man or machine is debatable!) i'd like the 800w but i don't see the rest of the machine so for most setups save those where folk put in 2 cards or a dozen drives, this should be fine for years. bob
