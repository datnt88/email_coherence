(check out jonnyguru.com, hardocp.com, and anandtech.com.) make sure that specific model has good marks or go with a better brand. antec tru power trio 650w, coolermaster's extremepower 650w, corsair's 650w, ocz's gamexstream 700w are all about $90 after rebates. ocz's 600w is one of the best power supplies for the money ($69 after rebate):  if you're willing to spend the money saved on the gigabyte mobo, just get a 8800gts/512. as for ram, you could go for faster cl4, but it won't make hardly any difference. likewise, ddr2-1066 is faster but only noticeable in benchmarks. i'd pop 4gb in just since it's so cheap now and you won't have to crack the case open anytime soon.

9869	3	293254	2762881	2762722	ramarc	5/1/08 5:39 am	1.20962034e12	3.16ghz e8500 is $275 vs 3.0ghz e8400 for $200	only 5.3% faster but 37.5% more expensive.

9869	8	293254	2763513	2763409	pigtacular	5/1/08 6:35 pm	1.2096669e12	changed corsair type	i ended up going with this:  i had read it's better to go with 2 2gb sticks.
9869	9	293254	2763709	2763513	ramarc	5/2/08 5:17 am	1.20970542e12	you also quadrupled your cost	those sticks are way overpriced . for that price you could get ddr2-1066 with the same 5-5-5-18 timings:  here's another ddr2-800 2x2gb kit with the same timings for $81:  tighter 4-4-4-12 timings are only a few bucks more:  p.s.: 4x1gb is fine if you run at stock speeds (and you don't seem to be interested in overclocking).

9869	12	293254	2763988	2763997	pigtacular	5/2/08 1:06 pm	1.20973356e12	the prices have changed since i ordered.	it actually comes out about the same. the rebate on the the ram originally listed was good on only one of the sets. so i wasn't getting both sets for ~$30 for a total of $60 also the ram i'm getting is listed for more than i what i paid for it. i think an offer expired. either way it was going to be ~$120. also, a big factor in switching was that the corsair message boards were saying the mobo i got didn't do well with all the slots filled up with the ram i originally listed.
