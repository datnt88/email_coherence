4483	3	172977	1907059	1906559	selvesterson	4/29/06 5:14 pm	1.14633084e12	here's a screenshot and my experience on compaqs site.	compaq's site if you look at those drivers, they are all updates, and if you click on them they tell you what they fix. the closest ones were the mainboard, and the dvd stuff that they had, but i've tried them and no use... i still have a yellow &quot;?&quot; by video in my device manager and my windows move with jerkiness take a look at this  screenshot.bmp this is the program that identifies your system.

4483	6	172977	2043715	1907854	selvesterson	7/2/06 3:31 pm	1.15185426e12	it's onboard and i still haven't found it yet.	i don't have the start up disks that came with it. i have a new version of xp installed... i called microsoft and got an activation code from referencing the number on the sticker... but i have to go to compaqs site to find the drivers and they just aren't there. i've downloaded so many different video drivers and i just can't find the right one.
