1596	6	355869	3137397	3117786	jeremyislame	9/28/09 1:09 pm	1.25414334e12	autonet router installed!	ok so ... i got my router installed and working! here is my review with the experience so far. delivery- came fast and easy.. i ordered from amazon.com and the cost after rebate was a little over $200.00 ! $386.94 plus tax with a $200 rebate! installation- i had my local stereo store install it under my seat for $50! they told me it took about 30 min! performance- first off.. one thing i learned that the autonet router does that i didn't know it could do is the system actually manages the data for you as well as the connection to the towers, lets say you are moving down the highway ...uploading a document and you lose connection to the tower...... autonet will put the upload on pause.. and resume once you re-establish connection. this means you won't lose the data you are transmitting or send half of a document .. possibly corrupting a database. amazing! i would say autonet is pretty spot on with what they claim. it seems to work seemlessly while in motion.... much better than my cell card did. i am able to stream pandora without choppyness or lag ... i will say that every now and then you may get a second of hiccup but it's not enough to annoy you.... like once every 30 minutes. video streaming also works pretty good... granted it's still a 3g connection so the loading can be a little combersome but once it's starts streaming i have noticed very little hiccuping. it's for sure better than a cell card. range-autonetmobile claims you can use it up to 150 ft from the vehicle and i would say this is accurate. i didn't bust out a tape measure but i was about 120-140 ft away with no problems. all in all i would say i feel really good about the price and the performance... in the long run it will save me money for sure ... my cell card was costing me about $80 per month on average and autonet is $29 flat rate. no taxes, no overages, no roaming. i am definitely excited to road trip it up now!!!!
