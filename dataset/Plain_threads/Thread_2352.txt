(???) so, let's all call edward at 877-917-4380 ext.79 he was actually a very nice sounding person... i emailed hp ceo mark hurd and said that if someone doesn't try to rectify this ongoing problem, a class action law suit was in order. i refuse to buy another new monitor for $350+!

(fixed!) 4) did a few computer updates to ensure monitor would not have the same problem...worked great then 5) downloaded the most recent driver from ati radeon site (package installer) as their site doesn't have my ati radeon 9200 listed...updated using the full installer and still working great hope this helps puddle jumper
