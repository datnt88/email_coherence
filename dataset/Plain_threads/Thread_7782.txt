(first 10 gig hd with w98 at primary and then it is on secondary ide) after booting we can see both hard disks in my computer if i take out the 20 gig with windows 2000 the pc can not boot there is an error message on the screen no operating system found that means the bios can not detect the 10 gig hard disk. this motherboard is intel 82810 810 chipset do you have any idea? thank you for your precious time and advice. hpc

(this test was done with a 120g drive as slave and a 160g drive as master). note that the standard is for the end of the cs chain to be master and the middle is to be slave, but it seems that the cables that come with the newer drives, the 80 pin cables can double as a cs cable or a jumpered master slave. make the cable do its master slave installation by setting the correct jumpers. this will allow you to put the master anywhere on the chain, but if you mix fat32 and ntfs, then fat32 prevails. this will only occur if both drives are bootable. i do not know if this is a function of the bios (suspect), or of microsoft windows, but it causes a lot of confusion. i have run across this in three machines that i have tested. norm
