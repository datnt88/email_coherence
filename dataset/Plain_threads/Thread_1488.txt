8440	3	339624	3028446	3028180	josephfuentes	4/19/09 7:54 pm	1.24017084e12	the model numbers are what nvidia's vista test gave me	the three tests i took, nvidia, ms, and pcpitstop all told me my laptop was capable of running vista. that wasn't the problem. the problem is none of them told me which version of vista i could use (except ms - see below). the part i'm angling for is support for aero. in my original post that portion was given to me by nvidia's own vista readiness test. i think i had to install some plug in. with nvidia being a graphics company they for sure took a hard look at my graphics chip. if i interpreted their results correctly it meant to me vista ok but just use vista basic. ms upgrade advisor however i think told me i was good for vista home premium. so i'm getting conflicting information. i could of course go to the store and try it out but what if aero doesn't work. i'm stuck with a copy of os i can't give back. finally looking at link a previous responder listed for me  it states in there the wddm model is supported with updated drivers but for a certain vista build only. though pixel shader is supported i don't know if this is enough. pretty confused here. help!
