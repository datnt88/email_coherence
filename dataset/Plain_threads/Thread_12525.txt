9774	7	552323	5256352	5255989	pellasp	1/5/12 7:33 pm	1.32579198e12	incorrect port	the router has wifi - i use it around the house with my laptop and my nook without a problem. when i try to connect the printer either by local port \\compname\printername or by the ip address that the printer lists that it occupies while connected to the wifi - it keeps saying error port does not exist or it tries to detect until it times out. i tried today to unplug my ethernet cord from the pc and try to create a wireless connection and see if that's the problem and i don't even see my network's name or any of my neighbors' for that matter on the wireless connections my pc is seeing. i'm thinking that's where the problem lies but not sure how to proceed from here.

9774	9	552323	5256426	5256418	pellasp	1/6/12 5:14 am	1.32582684e12	it if fine	the printer's connection to the router -is- fine. as i mentioned above the printer is connected, my nook is connected, my laptop is connected. there no reason to think the wifi doesn't work - it does. the problem is on the pc's side.
