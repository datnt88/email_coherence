9730	5	254931	2532209	2530497	doomrayz	7/5/07 12:00 pm	1.1836368e12	yes, there is a big difference.	the intel graphics media accelerator 950 is just a little graphics card that is good for surfing the web, and playing some low-graphic games and stuff like that. the nvidia geforce 7500le is a seperate processor for processing graphics, and is for the serious gamer. they downgraded the graphics card from the nvidia to the intel. i'm guessing they wanted to save money.

9730	7	254931	2532454	2532438	doomrayz	7/5/07 4:29 pm	1.18365294e12	yes, and yes.	yes, the intel 950 is capable of playing movies, including blu-ray/hd-dvd. it can play any movie you want. and yes, if you decided to switch to a serious graphics card (like the nvidia) you can.

9730	9	254931	2532494	2532446	doomrayz	7/5/07 6:30 pm	1.1836602e12	maybe $300, i'm not sure.	personally, i like to make my own pcs, that way i never get ripped off, but if you buy another pc i would recomend sony. sony pcs are expensive, but are worth the money (at least mine was!)
9730	10	254931	2532755	2532446	ozos	7/6/07 3:21 am	1.18369206e12	pocket media bay?	if you mean a multireader, you can add one yourself for around $20, it may not have the hp logo, but it'll do just what you want. if you want to add the media reader:  you can have it external, internal, black, white, etc i'm assuming you've purchased the 6157 based on what you've said so far, it offers an open pci express x16 slot, and you could put a card in there for $80 to $130 that would be easily faster than the 7500le (which is a very low level 3d card). if you wanted to put a 3d card in, i'd suggest looking at the geforce 8500gt, which can be found at newegg for about $80 (look at: evga, msi, xfx, bfg tech; avoid: ecs, jaton) however based on what you've described your pc needs as, the gma 950 should be just fine. based on the availability of inexpensive 3d cards which are easily faster than the 7500le, and low price of card readers, the $300 savings seems like $300 well saved, given that upgrading your new pc to the same level as the more expensive 7500le equipped model would cost roughly $100 and would give you a higher performance system than the 7500le model. to the comment on sony pc's, sony is notorious for using highly proprietary power supply and mainboard configurations, overcharging for almost everything, and having very limited upgradability due to the proprietary nature of most of their systems.

9730	14	254931	2533684	2533560	ozos	7/7/07 9:20 am	1.1838e12	not sure	i don't know the specifications of most oem power supplies, however 150w seems very low for a modern system. if it is in fact that low, i'd suggest replacing it before getting an 8500gt. 150w seems like a very low figure though, dell seems to be shipping 200-350w in most of its systems.

9730	19	254931	2535032	2533735	ozos	7/9/07 8:10 am	1.1839686e12	well	the hp unit is going to meet the spec of the system, not the system with upgrades, buying a new power supply will easily solve the issue, and won't cost all that much, it will also allow more upgrades in the future i would, however, like to point out, that there is no point in ugprading beyond integrated graphics if there is no real need to.

9730	21	254931	2535748	2535073	ozos	7/10/07 7:04 am	1.18405104e12	theres a number of things	first, yes, it does keep the price down, it provides a 2d subsystem and low power 3d subsystem without needing a dedicated card, which allows for less overall components, meaning less power is needed, meaning less is spent on the overall system. the other advantage is that it keeps power use down, keeps heat output down, if you aren't going to be doing anything beyond the capability of the gma 950, theres no point in having something beyond the gma 950 as it will just increase the thermal footprint, and therefore electrical footprint, of the system. integrated graphics are a convience for system builders and it personel alike, as it keeps the majority of the system on one board (yes, if that one board is damaged the whole system is gone, but we're going to assume its built to a good quality standard (which most mainboards are)) this means the whole system can be built faster, more easily, maintained more easily (you have one driver package from intel which gives you sound, video, and chipset drivers for i/o, networking, etc, instead of 3-4 driver packages for the same thing). the only real downside to integrated graphics is the 3d performance, a few years ago (and even to a degree today) nvidia was toying with putting more &quot;complete&quot; gpus on mainboards, such as the geforce mx 440, geforce 6100, etc, the gma 950 is generally faster than the mx 440, and generally competitive with the 6100. the 3d performance issue is a major thing for gamers, but for most other users theres no need to pay for anything beyond integrated graphics, if thats all they're going to really need.

9730	24	254931	2536161	2536091	vt53040	7/10/07 2:26 pm	1.18407756e12	my experience w/ a6157c..	my personal experience is good. the only thing i'd have to say bad is i hang/freeze in my browser's e-mail. this didn't happen on the a6077c. but i asked here, and ppl don't seem to think it's the graphics card. but more the browser itself. i also asked if ppl thought the $300 savings over the a6077c was worth it. so far, ppl thought it was, because better graphics cards can be installed by yourself cheaper. you are getting a smidge less in the hard drive too on this one. i'm going to try a movie soon. i'll let you know how it is.
9730	25	254931	2536397	2536091	ozos	7/10/07 8:07 pm	1.18409802e12	re your questions	most of your questions have to do with 2d display quality and performance, which hasn't been a real issue for computers since the mid to late 90's, so i wouldn't be too worried about it. however, i can understand your question and where its coming from. the 950 does use main system memory, however it doesn't use a huge piece of main system memory (i'm guessing 128m is probably the largest amount of memory it can have allocated to it (it doesn't have free reign, the bios allocates a block of ram to it)).
9730	26	254931	2536805	2536397	thill99	7/11/07 11:34 am	1.18415364e12	re: i printed out the specs...	thanks ozos for your informative posts, and also thanks doodledog for your reply to my post. btw, i found that costco has a $100 off coupon for the a6157c good aug. 13 to aug. 19 i found someone selling the coupon on ebay, but presumably one could also get the coupon book at costco. although it's hard to do direct comparisons of price because the a6157c is exclusive to costco, it appears to me that comparable systems cost significantly more if purchased directly from hp on their website. would anyone else agree/disagree?
9730	27	254931	2536829	2536805	vt53040	7/11/07 12:10 pm	1.1841558e12	i would agree..	i always price compare and research everything. no matter if it's a stick of gum or a computer bundle. coscto beats competitor's hands down for price. i was po'd because i have that coupon you mention, but i needed my system now, so had to eat the $100 savings . but because i had trouble with my previous a6077c, i returned it and saved $300. so i'm happy. oh! i also got some great advice from ozos about my browser issues. things work much better for me (and really faster) when i stopped using ie 7 & and switched to firefox 2 instead. i've posted a lot about typing issues, and hang time and went rounds with resolutions at hp and costco concierge tech support. i took ozos advice and downloaded my free version of firefox at  and i am impressed!!!! no more ie for me!!!!
