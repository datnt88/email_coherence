6235	4	33616	390042	389786	ray harinec	8/20/04 3:40 pm	1.0930164e12	what does the current rating have to	do with a voltage scale????? they draw virtually zero current. that's the point of a voltmeter. the old d'arsonvals were usually 10,000 ohms per volt. modern digital are multimegohm. meter burnouts occur when one tries to measure 120 vac when on an ohms scale [does it every time].

6235	6	33616	390670	390042	reefurbb	8/21/04 5:36 am	1.09306656e12	not the meter, the power supply	-12, -5 are rated at about 300-400ma, while other voltages are rated 5a-20a. the point being that the minus voltages can be easily burnt out. i don't think they have the same interupt as the + voltages do. short out the +5v and the pwr supp will restart instead of burn out. lightening or other way excessive surges can more easily burn out -voltages, as has been my experience.
