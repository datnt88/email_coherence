4559	2	125587	1421881	1421724	toni h	9/15/05 7:35 am	1.1267697e12	since both the mobo and the video card	are the newest out there, i would also assume that the voltage for both is compatible.....however, that assumption got me into trouble with a 'new' video card by nvidia that actually wasn't compatible and the only way i knew was because the video on screen actually was doing weird things that i didn't expect to see after booting up and even using the newest drivers for it. a friend i mentioned it to hit on the problem immediately and when i swapped the card for a different one, i had no problems anymore. so check the manual for both the card and the mobo to make sure they actually match up in that direction. something else, since i'm not familiar with your video card.....are there separate fans on it that need to be hooked up to the motherboard or power supply? if there are and you didn't plug them in, the card may have a setting internally to not fire up without cooling in place in order to protect itself. also...is your card a regular agp or is it agp-pro type? there is an extra little notch at the end of the slot for an agp-pro that has a coverplate over it, and if you remove it and your card is an agp type instead, it doesn't use that notch, but the card won't work until you cover that notch up again, so check to make sure the coverplate hasn't fallen off and you just didn't notice it. toni

4559	5	125587	1423670	1423485	billzhills	9/16/05 4:58 am	1.12684668e12	on line manual is pdf	and yes the page number may be different. if your card is apg you are set correctly. mentioned this as i've changed out video cards and failed to change this setting with the same issue that you have. hopefully someone else may help you find the answer. bill
4559	6	125587	1424067	1423670	toni h	9/16/05 7:50 am	1.126857e12	also....	many times the online manual has additional information that the printed manual didn't include at the time as new issues arise for their products. as long as you are at the manufacturer sites (both mobo and video card), check for any updates to the hardware that there might be available such as newer drivers or patches that correct issues and problems they have discovered since the hardware was first sold. toni
