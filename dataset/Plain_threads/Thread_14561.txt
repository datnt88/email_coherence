427	9	303629	2880722	2850959	kees bakker	10/13/08 4:30 am	1.2238722e12	sorry, but we don't do ...	homework and school assignments here. that's something you must do yourself: learning by doing. be sure your program had a good way of handling: - empty input (just return) - invalid input (like @1a' or 877) - short input (like 0) unless, of course, you're allowed to interpret &quot;assumed&quot; or &quot;assume&quot; as &quot;there's no need to check it and the program may give erroneous result or reach an abnormal end if these precondition isn't met&quot;. ask your teacher. a few more remarks: - the suggestion above of using an array is useful, but - given the order - not necessary. it should work without array also. - the assignment is about numbers (each on it's own line until you enter a negative one). your input example is about digits (all on one line and ending with a non-digit). - is it necessary to handle floating point numbers (like 3.14 or 3.14e13) or can it be assumed the numbers are positive integers? kees
