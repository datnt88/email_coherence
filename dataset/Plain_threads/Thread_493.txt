11343	4	218421	2323016	2322501	mrmacfixit	11/14/06 11:36 am	1.16350416e12	interesting	three people read the same post and arrive at a different view of what the poster is actually asking. here's my take: i think he is asking whether his existing windows software will be compatible with his new macbook. disregarding the fact that he could run windows on his new machine, the answer has to be no, it is not. the windows software will not run under os x. however, as pointed out, it will run when the macbook boots into windows. hardly making the switch from windows to mac. if he is asking whether his mac will be able to do the same things as his winbox, then the answer is a resounding yes, but with different software and better! and more!. web surfing, email, instant messaging and the like, happens on a mac as well. we all surf the same internet, it does not belong to microsoft, no matter how hard they try. so, just another take on the same question. hopefully jchau will find whatever he is looking for in the different answers p

11343	8	218421	2686382	2686363	mrmacfixit	1/23/08 4:46 am	1.20106356e12	not necessarily true	there are many company's that run a mixed platform shop. there may be &quot;software&quot; issues but there should not be hardware problems, unless your company is using some form of hardware authentication (smart card) to authenticate to your server. mac's connect to windows servers and desktops quite easily, it's part of the os. if your office is running active directory, there is a piece of software called admit mac, by thursby, that will allow the mac to interact with active directory. you need whoever told you that you cannot connect, to be more specific about what they perceive to be the problem. p
