(travel sites included) my problem is that i can get to the expedia.com website, but cannot actually perform a search for a flight or a hotel or anything. i could before i installed the router. this is frustrating, because i use expedia a lot, and i need to see the site. the site just hangs in my browser, or i get page cannot be displayed.... i called netgear customer support three times, and each time they had me reduce the mtu size on the router settings. i have done as they asked. the current setting for the mtu is 1250. i still cannot get expedia to work. does anyone know how i can adjust this to make it work? or if not, please do not recommend linksys, but what else? is there a brand that anyone would suggest i try? this is frustrating. thank you
