4477	6	520140	5098264	5098218	aalake	3/12/11 12:39 pm	1.29993354e12	why?	my post had to do with what your post is talking about. causing problems on my desktop computer if i buy an ipad - meaning i would have to install itunes and put up with things i would rather not put up with. not just with music but because it is the basic software that runs iphones and ipads. when i installed itunes many years ago at the advice of the kids in the office this happened: music sounded terrible played with itunes. several times a day people tried to access my computer. i began to associate popular music with kids chitchatting all day long and swappping stuff. (i chitchat too, on facebook, but never about the song of the day.) it was right after the era of napster which i thought was kind of fun until i discovered i could easily convert music i already had on other media to mp3 or wma. and cds got cheaper. and amazon came along with 99cent tracks. so i think my answer is going to be the same: wait for a wifi-only tablet which is just as good as ipad2. i certainly don't need one - it would be a toy and i don't want itunes messing up my 'serious' computer. you confirm my doubts.
