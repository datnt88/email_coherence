(the files sound fine when played off the c: drive.) anyone have any idea what is causing this? is this a defective drive? i tried xferring files one at a time, no help - fj

8824	4	20921	226397	225791	frankzxcv	4/26/04 1:44 pm	1.08298704e12	what is pio mode?	in device manager, under ide ata/atapi controllers, clicking on properties/ advanced i see the c: drive is in ultra dma mode but for the new troublesome drive, the transfer mode says &quot;dma if available&quot; but the &quot;current transfer mode&quot; says pio mode. -- what the heck is that? ??? thanks for your help! (i think everything was set to auto in the bios but i can check again) --fj

8824	7	20921	226544	226538	frankzxcv	4/26/04 4:11 pm	1.08299586e12	solved	well i put the drive on the secondary ide cable and all is fixed. fyi pio mode is a really slow mode. . . probably caused by faulty cable. time to get to microcenter! - fj

8824	9	20921	227004	226544	jmarchi	4/27/04 6:41 am	1.08304806e12	re:solved	actually the pio mode is usually caused by not going into the bios and setting the drive to auto when you add a new drive to a system. are you sure you did this when it was plugged into the other connector?
