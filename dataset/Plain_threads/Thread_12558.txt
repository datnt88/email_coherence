4792	3	60795	721924	721891	patok	1/28/05 1:25 pm	1.1069187e12	update	i managed now to file share between the two pcs, it had something to do with my zone alarm firewal, there was a zon that should have been trusted but was internet so i changed, now i'm trying to use internet, i heard about proxy but never used it and i don't kno if this is the case for it, so if it is, can somebody tell me so
4792	4	60795	722328	721924	michael geist	1/28/05 3:48 pm	1.10692728e12	you appear to be connecting the computers....	directly to each other without the help of a router. in which case i would suggest you review the use of xps built in internet connection sharing feature:
4792	5	60795	722540	722328	philt	1/28/05 5:16 pm	1.10693256e12	also	what you also should be able to do is to select both your adsl usb modem and the local area connection in your network connections window and right click them and select bridge connections. if both computers have static ips assigned to their network cards, which i assume they do since they are talking to each other, this should also work. make sure that on the pc that is not connected to the asdl modem, you assign dns numbers and make the gateway the ip address of the computer that is connected to the internet.
4792	6	60795	722604	722540	patok	1/28/05 5:34 pm	1.10693364e12	thanks	thanks, but i already fix the problem, it was all zonealarms fault, as i did not found a wa to change the settings correctly, i changed to another popular free firewall, kerio. thanks anyways to all of you
