5875	5	259967	2565298	2560359	dahlgren	8/18/07 1:00 am	1.1873988e12	which games?	i&quot;ve had my hard drives divided into primary (c:) partitions (active and inactive) and extended partitions containing logical drives (d:,e:,etc.) since the days of the 386's and ms-dos 3.3 and up through today. i also own hundreds of commercial pc games. in all that time i have only come across maybe one or two games that required installation on the c: drive, and they were very old dos games from the era when hard drives were not common in home computers. now, maybe it has something to do with the kinds of pc games that i play that i haven't seen this c: drive-only install phenomenon, but in this day and age of huge hard drives and multi-boot systems it would be insane for a game manufacturer to require a c: drive install. so, just so i, and others, can know what to watch out for: which games require installation only on the c: drive?
