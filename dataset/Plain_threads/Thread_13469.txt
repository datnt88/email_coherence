13309	5	177617	1950037	1949819	ramarc	5/20/06 4:50 pm	1.1481438e12	why kill so much from task manager?	a process kill is not a clean way to close an app and should be done only if the app is not responding to regular close requests. if you have to resort to task manager to close apps, something is wrong with your os or apps. if you want to stop services, use the net stop command or the computer management applet of administrative tools.

13309	13	177617	1953637	1952611	ramarc	5/22/06 6:31 pm	1.14832266e12	i've used cacheman (&quot;free&quot; version) for about 5+ years	in the era of 1gb pc's it's not really needed anymore, but it does make a big difference with 256mb machines. much less swapping and it gives a simple interface to tweak the cache behavior (instead of regedit fiddling). windows loves caching everything even if its to the detriment of new/on-demand memory needs. with the default parameters, the system cache can eat up all free ram, causing any mem allocations (like for the menu item you just opened or the new program you just launched) to cause pagefile access. since it's &quot;free&quot; you (and the poster) have nothing to lose.
