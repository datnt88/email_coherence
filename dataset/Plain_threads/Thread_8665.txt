7721	6	258370	2552531	2552226	ronswor	7/31/07 1:19 am	1.18584474e12	the only hope is some agp video card	again thanks for your help much appreciated.

7721	9	258370	2552886	2552694	ronswor	7/31/07 11:19 am	1.18588074e12	you have to look at your board	hi again, i downloaded the motherboard manual and it said there are 2 pci slots for pci 2.2 1 vgaport and 1 internal agp 4x so does that mean i can use either or just the empty pci slots.
7721	10	258370	2552942	2552886	r. proffitt	7/31/07 1:29 pm	1.18588854e12	since there are only pci slots.	you use those. newegg has some pci fx5200 cards or better such as...  my kid played most games on his 5500 (although it was agp) bob
7721	11	258370	2553309	2552942	ronswor	8/1/07 5:07 am	1.18594482e12	sinse there are only pci slots	last question i hope bob, in the manual it says 2x 32 bit slots do i have to have 2x 32 bit or one 64 0r doesn't the bit size matter because all i have seen is the 128 bit.
7721	12	258370	2553332	2553309	r. proffitt	8/1/07 5:52 am	1.18594752e12	it's two 32bit pci slots.	unless it's built by the nsa for some dark project your slots are good old pci... bob
7721	13	258370	2553346	2553332	ronswor	8/1/07 6:39 am	1.18595034e12	it's two 32bit slots	thanks again, will give it a go and tell you if i have my pc back off my son
