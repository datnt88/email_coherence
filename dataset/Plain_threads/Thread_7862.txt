12145	3	8984	105174	105033	mikcarsd	1/20/04 8:29 am	1.07458734e12	please disregard beep question	since i have located a website that covers them in their totality. the following information requested is hereby provided: i took my backup computer(amd 700/128sdram/7.1gb/98se/cdrw/10-100) to a niece 100 miles away. it is a replacement for her older model which has been retired. the unit has been used daily without a single malfunction for the last 12 months. connected to the monitor, keyboard, mouse and speakers - the monitor remained dark and there were no beeps. brought it back home and it works perfectly. took it back and the dark monitor persists. borrowed another monitor with same results. changed power source with no visible change. replaced keyboard with a new one since the original had three extra features we were not sure about: (1) power, (2) sleep and (3) wake. i had a similar experience last november 1000 miles away. i could not get the screen to show anything in two different monitors. we called a computer technician who sat in my chair and the screen immediately came on. to my observation, he just hit a random keyboard key but i cannot be sure about that. now, i am getting the 26 and 21 beeps.
