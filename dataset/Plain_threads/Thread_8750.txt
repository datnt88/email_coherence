(i live in australia and is ebay ok?) is buying a second hand or used cpu ok? is it worth it? will i need a new cooler? is it as simple as this: --  -- or will i need to change options in the bios or in windows my current temps are around 12-14 degrees celsius and i think the cooler is an avc c7015b12m fan with this heat sink:  (i don't know what it is called). so it looks like this:  . at this stage i'm not sure if i want to do it but the more involved i get the more i want to do it! if you need any more information i will gladly try and find it for you. thanks.

(or is the info on the internet just newer because maybe the higher p4 cpus wern't around when my documentaion was printed) here is the link for my motherboard on gigabyte's site:  i cant't find my computer on packard bell's site. i am mainly using my computer for general use like email, internet, light gaming (e.g. age of empires 2), music and storage. the main reason is for shear speed as i am quite tired of waiting 1 or 2 minutes for itunes to load even though i have upgraded my ram (which has greatly increased speed). another main reason i want to do it is to maybe make the computer a media centre computer (with a program like mediaportal).

10349	6	292089	2756709	2756547	ski_rus12	4/22/08 12:07 am	1.20882282e12	bios	(i'm quite angry right now because i just finished typing my post then ie froze so thank goodness for safari. but i still have to retype the post!!! waaa) i am quite sure i cannot use the p4 prescott 3.4ghz because on the right hand side of this table:  it says it is not avaliable for my motherboard. i am running the original bios and have never upraded it. the main reason for that is i don't know how but hey!, i can ask cnet. so will i have to upgrade by bios to upgrade my cpu? i still sort of want to know where i can buy a cpu. i am in australia not far from sydney but too far to go just for 1 little cpu. there is a computer fair just down the road that that runs every month so i will take a trip down ther when i can. is buying a used cpu alright because i can't get boxed ones any more as intel no longer does this for this cpu an is ebay a good place to buy them? if i do find the northwood cpu would i need a new heatsink/fan and would there be a considerable increase of speed if i did upgrade from the celeron 2.1ghz?

10349	8	292089	2757208	2756709	vapcmd	4/22/08 8:36 pm	1.20889656e12	sure that's the right link ? it didn't work for me.	most often what i see is ....a mfg like pb build a system using a mb from a company like gigabyte but often it's not a production mb....it's made specially for pb, hp or gateway, etc., but in this case it appears that pb is using a retail production gigabyte mb and that you could use the gigabyte bios vs the pb bios. there's risk that it might not work or fail however if it works ...it could permit a higher performance prescott cpu. the other option is buy new and at today's prices...that's an attractive option. vapcmd ps...you would have to get a more robust hs fan for the prescott cpu. without advertising .. intel makes hs fans to match the cpu so they're beefier for the higher end units.
