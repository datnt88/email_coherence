6651	6	263763	2582686	2582593	kitabata	9/11/07 1:33 pm	1.18951758e12	pans and videos	since this would be the first webcam i'm getting obviously i haven't any experience with them. i'm not panning your lighting tips though. sorry if you got that impression. what i was getting at though, was you said that the camera i saw was no different from the ones you owned. so i'm asking, what would be different? thanks for the link. unfortunately, i am at work now so i can't view youtube links. but i will check it out at home.
6651	7	263763	2583687	2582593	kitabata	9/13/07 12:37 am	1.18964382e12	very interesting	finally saw that link you posted. that was a fascinating video. thanks again for sharing. i'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however. i'd just like to use it for video im, so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid, i don't think i'd mind. i do appreciate your responses though.
