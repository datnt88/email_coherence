(i would not like to overclock the cpu as i am not too savvy there as i could cause some serious harm to my system) i once used a diagnostics software called sisandra or something similar and i think it had an option to use free ram to help the cpu, but i'm not sure how i would go about it, what would you recommend for me to make use of the free ram instead of the cpu sweating at 100% usage and the ram lazing about, many thanks in advance for any replies
