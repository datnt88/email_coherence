8261	2	59191	703312	702918	flek	1/21/05 12:09 pm	1.10630934e12	lots of reading	thanks for the link, i hadnt thought to include the router model in the search, i'll read up all of this, much obliged.

8261	9	59191	712544	711368	flek	1/25/05 7:53 am	1.10663958e12	starting to sink	i did not know about the machine log on, i thought the dialup connection log on was enough. so, in your example, if the dial up claims to connect but the home lan is still there then it isnt really a successful connection? and yes the it staff is suposed to set it up, and unfortunatly i'm supposed to be the it staff... are ports 1723 and 47 the only ones needed to connect to a vpn over pptp connection?
8261	10	59191	715497	702875	flek	1/26/05 9:29 am	1.10673174e12	and a solution is found	as unwanted as the solution is, heres what i found.  &quot;it seems to be that the box can't handle the gre protocol 47 correctly. linksys seems to think that this is a port that needs to be opened, rather than a protocol. consequently, the initial link is made through port 1723, and the vpn server can't then create the necessary link for the tunnel.&quot; *sigh* time to get a new access point
8261	11	59191	715522	715497	r. proffitt	1/26/05 9:34 am	1.10673204e12	now you see why...	i tend to push for a vpn router when vpn access fails...
