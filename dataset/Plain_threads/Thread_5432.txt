11730	6	299059	2799333	2799299	ramarc	6/25/08 2:05 pm	1.2144027e12	you're only saving about $50	here's a new a6432f that's comparable to a6357c.  i'm sure that if wait a week or two, you'll be able to find one from a retailer like bb/cc/od that's the same price as newegg and probably has a monitor or printer thrown in.
