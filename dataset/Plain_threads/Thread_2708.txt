15144	4	93411	1055759	1055746	we sim	3/19/05 8:02 am	1.11121932e12	re	hi! frankly speaking i've not bought my dlink wireless internet cameras yet. my first step is to get a storage router which i have now. next is to buy an external hard disk follow by the dlink wireless internet cameras. i'm intending to set up a simple home surveillance system whereby i can see remotely and record for say 24hrs a day.
