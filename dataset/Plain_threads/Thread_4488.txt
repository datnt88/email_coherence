(dell studio slim pc uses a 250w power supply for a q9550 quad core.) as for upgrading to a better video card, you won't find many that are low-profile and you'll have to measure the power supply of your case to determine what replacement alternatives you have. there is no mini-itx power supply standard size.

11014	6	339329	3026838	3026577	ramarc	4/17/09 6:23 pm	1.23999258e12	yes, the barebones i linked to has dvi output	the msi may have hdmi outputs. i've used the amd version of of this asus as a workstation/guest room pc with a 26&quot; lcd tv so i know it will work great as a home theater pc. i let my subcontractors/clients rdp into the it to do their work/see demos, and i let my neices/nephews use it as their pc when they spend a weekend.
