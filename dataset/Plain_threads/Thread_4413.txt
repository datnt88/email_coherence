2927	0	10897	125198	nr	onefinger	2/6/04 11:56 am	1.07606856e12	floppy drive not recognized	i just replaced my motherboard with a used one of the same make/model/chipset, so bootup was quite easy. however, there's one problem: my floppy (a) drive isn't recognized. it doesn't light on startup, and isn't shown in windows explorer. (os is win98se). i'm sure one possible reason for this is a damaged/defective motherboard, but am hopeful there's another, less drastic, cause. can someone please give me some insight as to what's causing this? also, am i correct in my understanding that the red stripe on the ide ribbon cable goes to the outboard side of the floppy drive? my fd connector has alignment slots on both top and bottom, so i want to verify that i've installed the cable correctly.
