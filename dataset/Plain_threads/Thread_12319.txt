11332	6	191862	2085553	2085504	vapcmd	7/22/06 9:44 am	1.15356144e12	you'll see the new vendor prices at places like	techbargains.com, anandtech.com, tomshardware.com, newegg.com, zipzoomfly.com, etc., as soon as they're posted. no one here knows such info unless they work for one of the retailers .. and telling potential buyers like you or me would not be in their best interest. vapcmd
