767	7	91444	1029777	1029580	steven haninger	3/9/05 1:09 pm	1.11037374e12	i'll try but a question first	you say you upgraded your ram. did you do this yourself? if not, and you are not comfortable with opening your case and removing a module, the step by step instruction will not help you. but, you can do this. as i said, allow display of system and hidden files. here's how. from the desktop, click on &quot;my computer&quot;. go to tools/folder options/view. check the option to show hidden files and folders and uncheck one that says t to hide protected operating system files. click ok and exit. now, go to your boot drive which is usually c: and click on that. you should see a file called &quot;pagefile.sys&quot;. it will display the size in kilobytes. write down that number and note if it's approximately 1 1/2 time the amount of ram you have. i'll guess about 115000kb but it won't be exact. now, if you remove one of your ram modules (power off of course) and recheck the size of the pagefile, you may find it to be smaller by a similar ratio to the math you just performed. what this means is that, when you added ram, windows expanded the size of this file. i'll guess it to be about 3/4 of a gig smaller now. hope this makes some sense.

767	9	91444	1030111	1029916	steven haninger	3/9/05 3:15 pm	1.1103813e12	good. i was hoping you would say that	it means you're not that much of a newbie. i tried to offer a reason why adding memory would lessen your available hard drive space. you're free to validate or invalidate that as a reason so the rest is up to you. good luck.
