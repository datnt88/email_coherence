(ditto in landscape orientation, with the red lines vertical) the red line problem shows up in all cases, even when printing in grayscale. nozzle checks are clean and correct (except for the extra red lines) i've changed the magenta printer cartridge. all cartridges are epson oem. i've downloaded the latest epson drivers for os 10.6
