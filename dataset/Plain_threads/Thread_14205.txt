7686	0	219495	2328093	nr	ballinwithbach	11/21/06 6:34 am	1.16409084e12	i recently purchased a d-link dwa-542 desktop adaptor	and now the sound is somewhat corrupted. i mean that every minute or so music or dvds or whatever seems to be warbled. i'm able to access the internet without a problem and i don't think that installing this hardware has interfered with the irq channels since sound is controlled by the mobo. problem is, the drivers that came with the desktop adaptor were not xp verified. so if anyone could please tell me how to troubleshoot this, i'd be grateful.

7686	2	219495	2329723	2328093	kayinangel	11/23/06 1:10 pm	1.1642874e12	same problem	i just got the same card, and its doing the same thing. studdering occationally, as if my system is doing hard work, when really its just idle. i can tell something is happening because any audio playing will studder as if slowing down momentarily, as well as mouse speed studdering. i'm certain it has nothing to do with drm as suggested above, as it affects entire system, its just more noticable with audio playing (including game audio). i read people having problems with the drivers (  ), and that &quot;the chipset is made by atheros, which also is in the wpm7000 by linksys&quot; (from post in link above), but i can't seem to find the drivers for a wpm7000 by linksys, if it even exsists. this is really a pain in the ass. uninstalling the card gets rid of the problem, and it comes back when i reinstall it. its also auto starting the d-link wireless connection manager twice, so that two green bars appear in my notification area. i had a netgear wpn 311 who's drivers kept crashing to blue screen randomly, which is why i thought i was &quot;upgrading&quot; to this d-link card and router. so im not having the best of luck with wireless.

7686	5	219495	2714691	2328093	shermanium	2/25/08 3:56 pm	1.20395496e12	same problem of stuttering audio/video	i tried the linksys driver, it didn't work, the internet connection sucked i got the updated driver from dlink [1.02 i think] and now i have a great connection, but i have the stutters anyone?
7686	6	219495	2714693	2714691	shermanium	2/25/08 3:58 pm	1.20395508e12	also, i tried the dma switch, no luck	forgive my ignorance, but what does switching the dma of my ide harddrive or cdrom help this issue with a driver for a network adapter card? or am i doing something wrong?

7686	8	219495	2714771	2714777	shermanium	2/25/08 5:47 pm	1.20396162e12	thanks	thanks for the reply, bob from what i can tell, both my primary and secondary are in dma mode. i still seem to having the audio/video stutter issue thanks again for the reply i guess i will have to do more research
7686	9	219495	2714796	2714771	r. proffitt	2/25/08 6:07 pm	1.20396282e12	the article above notes	we have to flip it to pio and back in a specific manner since we can't tell if it's in dma 0 or 5 or 6. if you decline the procedure i'd rather not explore all the other areas first. bob
