(whether wired or wireless!) my desiktop cannot map the drive. the software included with the drive runs and shows the drive and the ip address. i can log-on to the drive via a browser and change any setting. but, when i select run from the start menu and type in \\bigdrive and press enter .. i get &quot;the network path was not found&quot; i tried searching for the drive, but it was not found! i called buffalo tech support and they said it was a windows problem and i should unmap any other drives and then map this one first. i disconnected my card reader because that occupies drive letters, and even uninstalled my iomega zip drive, but it didn't work. please help! terry

13224	3	166604	1920242	1919925	terrenceo	5/6/06 8:35 am	1.1469045e12	i fixed it!!!	i'll do my best to explain. i spoke to a networking person i know and they said the problem was with the way i initially setup my home network. my desktop computer was initially setup without a router. a direct connect to the cable modem. when i later added a router, everything seemed to work fine. i did, however, have trouble seeing other computers and drives on the desktop machine. i worked around this by accessing the desktop from the other computers. i should have paid more attention to this problem because it was an indication that my network was in a somewhat limited configuration. this is the part i do not explain too well... if i ran ipconfig from the command prompt, it would show 192.168.0.0 as the ip address of my computer. but the router's ip address was also 192.168.0.0. i am not sure how this happened, but it had something to do with the initial configuration (before the router). when i added \\bigdrive to the router, it grabbed an ip address and was only visible to other, newer machines added to the router. the desktop could not see it. what i did to fix it: i forced the ip address of the router up to another number: 192.168.0.1 made sure the desktop was another number: 192.168.0.150 also, i made sure that \\bigdrive was yet another number: 192.168.0.101. after that (and a number of restarts of the desktop, router and \\bigdrive, and suddenly everything was available. i hope my somewhat weak explanation helps! terry

(took some time) i installed an updated firmware file (v1.47) from the buffalo tech support website using the &quot; /force&quot; install parameter. (this also took some time). my original files were intact after this process was completed. after this was done, everything was working as it should be. apparently, the binary files somehow were corrupted. i just wish i knew how/why this happened so it could be avoided in the future. the linkstation lives a sheltered life, in a place where it doesn't receive any bumps, and is powered by a filtered, battery backed ups of considerable capacity.
