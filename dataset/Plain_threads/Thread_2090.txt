5452	3	90698	1020575	1020406	wizard_55	3/6/05 9:03 am	1.11009978e12	thanks	well bob i understand what you're saying here, only thing is this happens to only the 6792-6794 machines nothing else. hard to believe that the no protection from the delete key or any spyware would just be targeting only these machines. i might also mention that these machines are among the model of the known problem of swelling, leaking capacitors adjacent to the processor which causes involuntary reboots and or shutdowns. i have only discovered one machine thus far with the capacitor problem in the ones i support but know of many others.
5452	4	90698	1020583	1020489	wizard_55	3/6/05 9:05 am	1.1100999e12	thanks	for the input i'll have to look into this.
5452	5	90698	1020668	1020575	r. proffitt	3/6/05 9:50 am	1.1101026e12	you do have the item about ...	the cache not getting flushed on some machines. this item will affect only specific machines. but and this is a big deal, it would only affect machines that didn't have all critical updates. you as the administrator get to know all about this... given the age of this os, i do not expect ibm to be able to help you. bob
5452	6	90698	1022890	1020668	wizard_55	3/7/05 9:17 am	1.11018702e12	actually no i don't	i suppose you are refering to the l1 l2 cache not getting flushed? i can see where some files could get screwed up in a situation like this but for the life of me i can't see no way in hades the entire system folder or more especially the windows directory could actually vanish off the hard drive. like it's poof they're gone. where can i find more info on machines not flushing the cache, bob? thanks for your responses by the way.
5452	7	90698	1022985	1022890	r. proffitt	3/7/05 9:58 am	1.11018948e12	beside l1 l2, windows and the drive...	have cache that may need flushing. microsoft did supply a critical patch for this.  does not detail all the possible effects of this issue. bob
5452	8	90698	1023193	1022985	wizard_55	3/7/05 11:20 am	1.1101944e12	i checked that out...	and that could certainly explain a machine working fine one day and booting up the next with a missing vmm32.vxd error. still puzzling are the ones that have lost the entire system directory or windows directory. thanks for the info. have anything else let me know please.
5452	9	90698	1023248	1023193	r. proffitt	3/7/05 11:40 am	1.1101956e12	an example why...	the directory &quot;sector&quot; may need to get rewritten and ... fails. the old entry is invalid and you get the effect you note. only one reason why we don't bother with fat file systems at the office. at least with ntfs, the transactions are ... part of why ntfs is more damage resitant. there has been no attempts to cure this issue. bob
5452	10	90698	1023406	1023248	wizard_55	3/7/05 12:42 pm	1.11019932e12	strange	couple of co-workers and i had just discussed this and came to the same conclusion. your post just verified it. still there must be something with the particular machines we've had this problem with since the same load is on many other machines of different build and model times. we have downloaded that patch and installed it on an image to be used on two school labs containing the machines in question. guess we'll see if that was the fix for this problem. thanks much for the insight and expertise!
