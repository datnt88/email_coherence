(i can't check that right now - mac pro is not in the house.) i will definitely get a tripod for concert and dance recordings, so i hope the pictures will be stable to begin with. thanks again, awaiting reply about the mac website with options to find compatible camcorder (though maybe i have to ask for help from apple).
