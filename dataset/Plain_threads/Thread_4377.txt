(os 9.2.2--i have my reasons.) please don't give me helpful advice about why i shouldn't be using os 9 anymore. i appreciate the good will but couldn't act on it right now. just, please, if you know how to make the roller advance, tell me. if i can't do that, or if the dear old laserject refuses to work even after i get the paper bit(s) our and clean it, i'll come back and ask for more help, ok? thanks so much, in advance. jenny
