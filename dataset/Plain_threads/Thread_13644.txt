9760	3	348580	3074452	3074373	wettech	7/5/09 1:17 pm	1.24679982e12	cost	all the cards are between $60-110. don't know what improvement to expect. only assumptions i can make are that with my card being 128 and going to 512, it should be moderate.??
9760	4	348580	3074455	3074400	wettech	7/5/09 1:20 pm	1.2468e12	single core	that's what im trying to avoid, bottle necking from a better card to a single core system. if that's what will happen, then i guess i need to start from scratch. also i've included the nvidia gpu's in my searches, but they always get knocked out. and i'm not crazy about ati's software either.
9760	5	348580	3074443	3074455	r. proffitt	7/5/09 1:35 pm	1.2468009e12	the problem i ran into with the ati's	is the cpu would spike to 100% in games where the nvidia 9400 (sorry but that's the highest model i have) would on the same game not spike the cpu but would loaf around 30 percent. any ati i tried would have the cpu and gpu at 100% which had the fans running full tilt.
9760	6	348580	3074527	3074452	vapcmd	7/5/09 3:37 pm	1.24680822e12	i'd start by looking at tomshardware..link below.	it will help you get a better perspective on value and performance. just keep in mind every $$ you spend on an agp gpu could be going toward a new system with room to grow, a warranty, etc.,  vapcmd ps...re the 128mbs vs 512mbs ram ... that's part of it but i'm under the impression lots of ram with a whimpy gpu chip just doesn't make it fast or materially faster. i take from that performance has as much or more to do with the gpu chip itself.
