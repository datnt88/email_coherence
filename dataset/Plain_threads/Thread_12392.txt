12796	0	48754	579095	nr	dave33	12/1/04 9:01 am	1.10189166e12	should i change	i currently have 3 networked pcs in my house. these are wired using high speed cable internet. my question is should i consider going wireless with them. there are no issues with wiring but i am wondering if wireless is faster. im looking at the d-link di-624 router with d-link airplusxtremeg pci adapter. will this improve my speed? would it be worth while? thanks
