12189	1	28339	320765	320703	r. proffitt	7/6/04 8:48 am	1.08910368e12	can't tell!	some usb enclosures have a 127gb limit. you didn't supply make/model number as well as the web site/manual for the enclosure so i can only share that some had this limit. others try to use fat32 on the volumes and a nuisance seems to crop up with the 137gb limit. try this. once you are sure your sp1 xp is all proper, use the drive management tool to remove all partitions from the drive. reboot and use the drive management tool to create the new partition and try again. my bet is you have the older usb enclosures. bob

12189	3	28339	320883	320860	r. proffitt	7/6/04 9:38 am	1.08910668e12	is this it?	there are six listed at  a model number would be handy. as to formating in fat32, that's very odd. 1. why wasn't xp's drive management tool used? 2. i strongly advice against fat32. here's why. chkdsk seems to not work on many (most or all?) usb 2.0 drives. fat32 will develop errors and you won't have a way to resolve them. bob

12189	5	28339	320978	320703	art	7/6/04 10:40 am	1.0891104e12	i re-read your post...	i was all confused, my mistake. you hit the 40g limit, not the 137g. limit. the problem here is that we're not even sure if the hard (bios) can detect the whole drive or a potion of it. i might also add that with fat32 you will also run into the 4g. file size limit as well; so ntfs is the way to go when working with video because the size get big very quickly.

12189	8	28339	321313	321196	r. proffitt	7/6/04 2:18 pm	1.08912348e12	it's a small world.	i have an external usb 2.0 hard drive case and an 160gb drive in it. i used drive management and made a single 160gb ntfs partition. but i offered this advice. have you tried it? bob

12189	12	28339	322409	322337	jccole	7/7/04 7:46 am	1.08918636e12	re: format is format, but how did you partition it?	drive management would only give one partition and it ran out to only 39.4 gb, i deleted the partition, started over several times but could not find any options other than fat or ntfs and the one partition which formatted at 39.4. do i need to make any changes in my bios? this is a new dell 2400 running pentium 4, 256 memory and windows xp. as i indicated, this is not a boot drive, only for bulk storage.
