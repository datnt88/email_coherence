6299	3	275006	2649787	2649756	confusimo	12/8/07 9:14 pm	1.19714844e12	that's not the issue.	i'm talking about heat. not use and budget. does more power watts make more heat. or is the 65nm just more efficient than 90nm and 30watts is to little to make heat.

6299	11	275006	2653328	2651195	confusimo	12/13/07 12:00 pm	1.1975472e12	finally	it finally arrived. its a pentium 4 631. it's sl9kg according to the box. i forgot to look at the cpu. but it says so on the box. but its says 65nm according to cpuid.com. anyhow this thing is awesome. it says 18 - 20 c degrees in speedfan. and bios says about 25c degrees idol. not bad. and i even turned down all the fans. to low setting and i'm still getting those great temps. pretty cool for just a cpu change and nothing else. thanks, ivnj
