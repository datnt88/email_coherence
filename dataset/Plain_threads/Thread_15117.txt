7703	5	359660	3129682	3129649	r. proffitt	9/17/09 3:49 pm	1.25320254e12	yup. but one problem.	you find you may pay more than 70 later. how to do the upgrade? turn the power off, slide out the old battery, slip in the new one. bob

7703	8	359660	3131354	3129951	icanrule	9/20/09 3:08 am	1.25341608e12	yes. i am surer	i need something ultra portable with a long battery life. i have tried bluetooth adapters before and they all fall short of what i need. mostly because i forget them at places but also it's an add-on and i really hate add-ons. the same goes for the webcam. i had separate webcams but having one built in the computer is pretty sweet. processing speed is absolutely important. it's a computer no matter how you look at it. otherwise they would install windows mobile, or android. it is equally important to know how much ram it can take because it's a computer. same goes with hard drive space. i have had this netbook for 2 days and am really impressed with what i can do with it. it goes far beyond being able to view websites and writing documents like the advertisements say. i based that initially off of the specs but it was confirmed when i bought the device.
