13155	7	63793	769096	761271	cartmanken	2/16/05 12:25 pm	1.1085567e12	delay	thanks again steven. everything there compares to my other machine, but i changed the settings around, but to no avail. however, your post got me to thinking that maybe some other software is messing with things. i am using &quot;xp smoker&quot;, so i am going to do an uninstall there and see what happens. have a good one. ken
