4933	6	253578	2522840	2522477	carpiquet	6/24/07 8:21 am	1.18267326e12	it works!	well, i removed the jumpers and then plugged in the connections and it works perfectly. if i plug my headphones in the fron tthe speakers stop working and the audio goes to my headphones! the retailer had wired the front audio to a 10pin connector so i was hoping that they had jumpered the pins inside the connector to replace the blue jumpers the manufacturer installed. i guess they did. thanks for all your help!
