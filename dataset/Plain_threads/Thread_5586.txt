9115	6	282875	2697842	2697799	vp.	2/5/08 11:30 pm	1.2022542e12	hmm	the speed reduction issue is not the problem i'm encountering though. i'm aware of that issue, and it is a cpu limitation anyway. is that the only issue you found related to using 4 sticks? the bios version is interesting. mine is f2, so it's definitely out of date. unfortunately i'm having problems updating it. @bios is giving write errrors every time when trying to update the flash memory with the new bios version. i tried v11 and v3, neither worked. not sure how to proceed from here.
