9362	10	295376	2778766	2778365	ramarc	5/22/08 11:39 am	1.21145634e12	don't go to best buy for graphics card or cooling fan	you'll overpay unless you catch a great sale. if by &quot;disk tray&quot; you mean cd/dvd burner, then best buy will be competitive. if want a 8800gt, this one is hard to beat since it includes a game and is only $154 before $30 rebate:  here's a good cooler for $30:

9362	13	295376	2783003	2776741	slick_50	5/29/08 8:21 am	1.21204926e12	don't get the 650i	get a decent p35 motherboard that will properly support the 45nm e8400-e8500 processors. if you just have to have an sli motherboatd you would need to get the 750i variant to properly support the newer 45nm like this board here  a good intel board with a single 16x pcie slot gigabyte (gigabyte ga-ep35-ds3l) will do the trick.  the palit 9600gt will play modern games 5x better than the 8500gt will and it's affordable.
