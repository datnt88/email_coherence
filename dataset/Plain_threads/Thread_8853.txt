1462	5	89317	1003084	1003002	toni h	2/27/05 4:44 pm	1.10952264e12	the av/dv is the one i use now	and again, i didn't like the pinnacle software that came with it, but the card itself is awesome....great quality. the dazzle is still sitting on my desktop reading to plug in if i need it. the one thing i liked about the dazzle was when i was copying my vcr movies that had the macrovision encryption, it ripped it right out all by itself instead of my having to use the device i bought separately. none of the internal cards ever could. toni
