12471	6	101999	1171747	1170369	john robie	5/5/05 11:22 am	1.11529212e12	yep, on sale this week....	the emachine you are describing is the t3103 ...simpron 3100 processor and is on sale at circuity city until saturday night with 17&quot;crt(large-not lcd) monitor and printer for $419.97.   this is apparently a new product as emachine does not have it listed yet, and i am unable to tell if it has a agp or pcie slot for graphics upgrade. the compaq intel pentium4 processor 515j (2.9ghz) desktop package that you describe is shown in the circuit city flyer, but not online. it is also on sale with 17&quot; crt(large-not lcd) monitor and printer for $549 until saturday night. it has integrated on board graphics with the intel 915gv chipset, so does not have an agp or pcie slot. when you see media or digital reader 8-1 or 9-1, it is the same as memory card reader. as others have suggested, i would also suggest waiting on the t6212 sale package to reappear. it was on sale around the 1st week of last month for $549.98 with 17&quot; crt(large-not lcd) monitor and printer at circuity city and best buy.

12471	9	101999	1174872	1174593	john robie	5/7/05 12:39 am	1.11542634e12	emachine t6212...	as i recall, the &quot;big problem&quot;, was that one person had a problem with the hard drive and said a person at best buy told him it was a defect in the t6212. others have not had a problem with the hard drive and one person said no one at the best buy store he checked are aware of a problem. i also talked to a best buy rep in my city and he is unaware of any hard drive problems. rieltime talked to the emachine people friday am to get info on the power supply. if you are concerned, you could call emachine.

12471	11	101999	1175501	1175433	john robie	5/7/05 9:08 am	1.11545688e12	upgrades for the t6212...	for what you and your husband current need, no upgrade is necessary. the upgrade is mainly for gaming, and would also help in video editing, but especially your kids when they want to play more advanced games and or get older. the t6212 caught on for gamers (and others) mainly because of the features it has for the price. it has a fairly powerful processor, the athlon 64 3200, which has the 64-bit support for the future, amd's better socket 939 which usually doesn't come with inexpensive computers (i don't know of any), a motherboard which has a pci-express x16 video card slot allowing for upgrade of the integrated on board grahics. the new pci-express (pcie) video cards are the future slowly replacing agp cards. a 160gb hard drive, 512mb of ram (memory), 17&quot; monitor and printer are also a plus for an inexpensive computer. what the upgrade people are talking about is (mainly for gaming) replacing the integrated on board graphics with a pci-express video card. the ram is currently ok for current games, but some gamers believe the really high end games will benefit with up to 1024mb of ram. over that is really throwing away $$ at this time for any benefit imo. many inexpensive computers come with integrated graphics and no way to upgrade to a agp or pcie video card (they don't have a 'slot'). the only way they have to upgrade the graphics is to use a regular pci card, which is less powerful and limited to how high you can go in performance. you can expect your kids, as they get older, to ask you to upgrade to a video card, and the pcie is actually less expensive than agp. in addition, perhaps your husband will observe a game he likes and get into it. or even you. i was 66 years old and watching a nephew play some pc games which got me interested in buying my 1st computer. regards, jr
