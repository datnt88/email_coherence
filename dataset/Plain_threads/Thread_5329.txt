12536	4	262622	2575509	2575464	ramarc	9/2/07 8:45 am	1.1887227e12	that's not a high end system	the articles uses a 7300gs and 7600gt which only suggest 300w power supplies. draw from the wall from any pc is typically around 200w or less, but that doesn't mean you can get away with a 250w power supply. power supplies *split* their power into various rails (3.3v, 5.0v, and one or more 12v rails). when a high end video card (radeon x1900/hd2900 or geforce 8800) is installed, it can easily overload the 12v rail and cause the pc to crash (since the cpu also uses 12v power). the biggest power draws in a pc are the cpu and video card. hard drives draw very little power comparatively except at spin-up. as the article and poster said, the quality of the power supply is more important than an exorbitant power rating (there are practically no rules which govern manufacturer power claims). a good name brand (antec, coolermaster, enermax, thermaltake, seasonic, etc) 400w power supply is fine for everything but an 8800gtx and definitely better than a $30 600w unit.

12536	6	262622	2575533	2575466	digibop	9/2/07 8:58 am	1.18872348e12	i'll be ok	i have an antec modular neo power 480 watt psu going into a new build. so, i am not really concerned. right now i'm using an antec 430 watt psu and it's an older modol. never shows the slightest problem running video editing, encoding, games, photoshop, etc. so the 480 will run even better. antecs are extremely efficient and i always use them. of course anyone could go out and buy a 1,000 watt piece of cr@p and have it die in a week. i'm not debating with anybody, just trying to keep others informed. whether you like him or not george ou knows his tech.

12536	10	262622	2575884	2575584	digibop	9/2/07 7:08 pm	1.18876008e12	i'm not misrepresenting anything	vapcmd, i'm not misrepresenting anything. the articles title: build a great pc on a budget with these parts and procedures. true, but i asked you to read his comments. apparantly you did not. here are a few of his replies: if i went that extreme i'd probably go with a seasonic 400 watt psu just to have the extra overhead to house 6 more hard drives. but truth be told the 330 watt psu is technically enough even for an extreme pc if you don't put a lot of drives in to it. even an overclocked dual core system with an 8800 gtx will work on this 330 watt psu peaking at about 280 watts of power consumption. i use to run two old p4 system that peaked that high for many years. you just can't add any more drives or dvd burners to it. however, i'd probably recommend the 400 watt seasonic at $90 for that kind of system so that it has room to grow. if you've ever noticed, the seasonic power supplies are very conservative with their ratings. there are plenty of free psus you get with a cheap chassis that's labeled &quot;400 watts&quot;, that doesn't mean it's reliable at any where close to that. again, 330 is double over kill. i'm not pulling these numbers out of thin air. this system measured 110 watts at peak load at the power plug! even if this were an extreme system with an nvidia 8800 gtx, it would still be less than 280 watt peak which a quality 330 watt active pfc psu can handle with ease. this business of spending hundreds of dollars on a quarter, half, or one ton power supply is getting absurd. theres a tendency for power users to think more is better, but thats just a nice way to sell more expensive power supplies. i am no fan of george, but he's been around pcs a lot. vapcmd your &quot;quibble&quot; should be with mr. ou, i'm just stating what he wrote. like i replied earlier, i have an antec 480 watt neo power modular ps (my girlfriend bought it for me) so i'll be fine.
