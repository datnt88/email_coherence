2333	4	348638	3075131	3075100	ikjadoon	7/6/09 11:13 am	1.24687878e12	some answers, hopefully! :)	ok, so a quick google search on protools and fl studio show that they are multi-threaded, but, to be perfectly honest, they don't go into a lot of detail. it was literally one line in fl studios feature list and a few forum posting describing multi-threaded-ness on protools. so, i would definitely get a quad, but i think you knew that already. the part i'm debating is amd/intel quad. from my research, protools seems to work rather nicely with i7's, with a certain bench (dverbs, if you've heard of it) it gets twice the score than a q6600. if i were you, i would go i7. but, realize, you'll need ddr3. core i7 can only take ddr3, no ddr2 here. for the best performance with i7, we do want triple-channel memory. i'm not fully versed on the performance benefits from double to triple-channel, but the prices are close enough and i7 has a memory controller built for triple-channel, so why go slower? and, like i said, prices are close. do you plan to overclock? if so, i would go for one of those cases. but if you aren't, you don't *need* the cooling that those cases give and a cheaper case will suffice. but, here's the rub. the cheapest i7 is $280. an i7 motherboard will run you $200 or more, a few dipping into the high 100's. memory (6gb, triple channel) will be another $100. if you're counting right, we're at $580 and we haven't even bought the sound card, which sounds pretty important considering the tools you're using. we can dip down into intel quad's or amd's quads, but the i7 may be a bit out of your price range. both amd/intel quads are great. amd has cheaper motherboards and are a little more overclocking friendly, but intel's quads are faster per-clock than amds. a 3.2ghz amd (phenom ii 955) is a bit slower than the q9650 (3.0ghz). research your tools a bit, see what other people are using them with. some tools, unfortunately, are highly biased to one architecture or another. see if there are any anomalies there. good luck! ~ibrahim~

2333	9	348638	3075527	3075131	mrje1	7/6/09 9:27 pm	1.24691562e12	thank you again.	hi ibrahim, the links i have posted are working. i am not sure if you tried clicking on them. here they are again. jeff's computer build = stuff i already have and purchased {  } jeff's future build = stuff i am thinking about buying. {  } other case considerations = other cases i am thinking about. {  } thank you for the cpu insight. i will look into it. yeah, i realize it is a full tower case. i measured it and yes it is larger than my mid tower, but the only difference is the height, which is 16 on my midtower and 22 on the full tower. yes it is taller, but still fits in my work space. my mid tower is 20 is length or width what ever you call it and 8 inches from side to side. on the ones i picked it is about the same as those dimensions. should work out ok. if it turns out to be too big for my tastes, can i return to new egg with out a problem? i will check out as well. thank you again for your help. any thing else let me know. i should have some questions in a bit.
2333	10	348638	3075536	3075527	ikjadoon	7/6/09 10:14 pm	1.24691844e12	good, good. :)	i was actually referring to the ram you linked me, but i still like the one's i linked, unless you need a lower price? oh, yeah. newegg has a fantastic rma program. i'd much rather deal with newegg than a company. i looked through the case choices again and i really like the azza. the others are too expensive, imo, for what you get, but i'm not one to talk with a $220 case. but the azza looks like it has the good stuff: removable mobo tray, good fans, nice exterior design. it isn't tool-less, but i find the trusting reassurance of a tightened screw a bit more satisfying than the promise of wimpy plastic. ~ibrahim~
2333	11	348638	3075560	3075536	mrje1	7/6/09 11:28 pm	1.24692288e12	thank you.	thank you once again. sweet. i am going to get the azza case. those ram's are for intel motherboards, so i am no longer looking at those. i thought about that too. yeah, tooless is easier, but those thumb screws are not bad either. so, this looks like my final build  . i will make my final decision by the weekend for sure. if you or anyone else has any recomendations please let me know. thanks again.
