(  ) so i see a lot of fried external drives and data recoveries. my suggestion would be a glyph external hard drive (  ). i see tons of lacie porsche die, many lacie d2s die, almost all the crap no name drives die but i've never seen a dead glyph (of course i'm sure someone has had one die and i just don't know them.) when looking for an external drive there are a few things i consider. first the warranty length of the drive tells you how long the manufacturer thinks this product should last. glpyh drives have 3 year warranties which is longest of any the externals i've sold. second you want to look at the quality of the enclosure. enclosures with fans tend to last longer because they can disperse the heat that can lead to drive failure. third you want to look at the quality of the hard drive inside. even if the enclosure fails you can just swap the hard drive inside to a new one. however, if the drive fails that's when you go into paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for data recovery. get a reliable brand name internal hard drive like seagate or hitachi (maybe maxtor). good luck and thank you for thinking about back-up now instead of after its too late. jazmin tekserve, 23rd & 6th ave, nyc 212.929.3645 ''may you have a thousands back-ups and never need one.''

(some require permission for unknown proticols.) the maker indicates that any ide drive up to 250gb should work (possible larger)i have found them to be rugged in construction and easy to transport. (ac required) this drive allowed me to solve the problem of all my computers running low on storage and sharing files while isolating one pc from another for security on my home network. happy computing, marko
