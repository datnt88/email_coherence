(i'm going to run memtest86+ later tonight, just to make sure). i'm also going to switch out the new power supply with an older one i know works well once a new drive shows up in the mail. if that drive gets fried the same way the first two did despite changing the psu and the memory checks out okay, well, then i know it was a motherboard problem. does this make sense, or am i forgetting about some other possible factor?
