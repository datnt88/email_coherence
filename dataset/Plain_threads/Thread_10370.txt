(the one inside is a willamette 0.18um technology acc to speccy) - what type of memory can i use. i saw a post here saying ddr ram(whcih seem to have won out the battle) is not compatible with rdram. can i swap out all the rd rams to some other platform without changing the board... sorry for the long winded query but appreciate any expert advice. happy holidays to all.
