7781	7	256629	2541304	2541292	r. proffitt	7/16/07 10:33 am	1.18458198e12	now the other 2 and about the hard disk.	why is the hard disk suspect? if so try the hard disk makers disk test software. keep the cover off for now. also, a complete list of what was running at the time of the crash (use tasklist) would be nice as well as a short story about all the lovely drivers you installed after you were done with the windows cd. as well share that all the fans are spinning. bob

7781	9	256629	2543873	2541249	gliderian	7/19/07 11:30 am	1.1848446e12	i would try a different motherboard	this sounds like a major issue. i would go back to where you got your mobo and either get it exchanged or better yet try a different manufactuerer. i checked out the chaintech page and i cannot get any info on their motherboards. plus their site is incredibly slow.
