(double the price of the card i already purchased without realizing the power needs it has...) i was reading the specs though... and its says: 400w pci express-compliant system power supply with a combined 12v current rating of 26a or more it does say 400w not 375w?
8958	11	199280	2565283	2564704	kpo6969	8/17/07 9:37 pm	1.18738662e12	what's not to understand?	his 375w has 30amps. the card requires 26amps. watts is not the whole picture, it's the combined amp rating on the 12v. for example here is my psu specs: 305w dell psu 22amps on the combined 12v rails 18a + 18a 264watt maximum combined watts on the 12v rails divided by 12 = amps 264 divided by 12 = 22

( i dont want to put strain on the psu)so replacing the psu is the best option, but not sure if it will fit or blow up something... lol was looking at  will this work?
