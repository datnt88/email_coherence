2300	4	126604	1433018	1432939	danetree	9/21/05 6:30 am	1.1272842e12	i checked...	...the instruction manuals and it says 2.0, i even came across the broucher and it said 2.0. also, it has the &quot;direct hd&quot; function, not that i have used it, but in the blurb for it it also specifies 2.0. perhaps the version put out here(japan) of this machine is different to the specs of the one you saw. the usb ports seem to work ok for other things, web cam, printer etc. actually, tried connecting it again via usb and the computer made the &quot;ding-dong&quot; noise it usually does when something is connected. nothing came up in the systems tray though. it then &quot;ding-donged&quot; again. so, any further suggestions? thanks for the answer too. would there be any alternative ways to connect my old hd to my laptop? thanks

2300	6	126604	1433082	1433032	danetree	9/21/05 7:04 am	1.12728624e12	last couple of questions...	1. is it worth while upgrading to sp2 2. if it does actually connect, will i be able to get the data from the hd? 3. just want to confirm the usb thing so is there some way i can check in the computer itself? i will also try and the drive or disk management but the only problem is that its all in japanese and is going to take me some time! gulp. what exactly should i be looking for with the drivers? thanks

2300	8	126604	1433137	1433105	danetree	9/21/05 7:31 am	1.12728786e12	clarification	re question 3: i was wondering if it was possible to check the usb are actually 2.0, perhaps through control panel? i live in tokyo and i bought the machinee here, hence why the os is in japanese. if i am going to be looking around for the it will take me a while as my japanese especially as far as computer terminology goes is limited. yes the os came with the machine. does this mean i dont have to look for the drive and disk managment?
2300	9	126604	1433140	1433137	r. proffitt	9/21/05 7:36 am	1.12728816e12	one thing is not the other.	usb drivers would be proper (or should be) so let's leave those as-is, whereis. as to drive management, it's the tool that comes with xp to look at and manage drives. it's one of my first stops when i go looking for a missing drive. i don't write about it in any detail since if not in start, help and support we have google to read up about this tool. bob
