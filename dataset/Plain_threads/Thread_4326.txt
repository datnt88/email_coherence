[code]  [/code] then i ran the diagnostic test again in &quot;hutil&quot; as these were the results.. --- test loop number 1/1 read dma : testing... error: sector error check m.c : testing... pass! check s.m.a.r.t : testing... error: s.m.a.r.t threshold exceeded. spin down/up : testing... pass! simple read/write : testing... pass! simple surface scan : testing... pass! write verify : testing... pass! average seek time : testing... pass! maximum seek time : testing... pass! random surface scan : testing... pass! read surface scan : testing... c:1039 h:0 s:962 error: ecc error c:1040 h:0 s:797 error: ecc error c:1580 h:0 s:1037 error: ecc error c:7354 h:0 s: 965 error: ecc error error : this drive has some defects. --- thats two less read surface scan errors than last time i think. the disk is no longer under warranty so no point contacting any service centers. now although my old disk is not very healthy, it is still usable and i was thinking of using it as a single partition storage drive. is there anything more i could do to the disk to remove those errors and make it more healthy. or should i just prepare/ntfs-format the drive and start using it.
