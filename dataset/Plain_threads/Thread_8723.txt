(options): 1. safe mode 2. safe mode with networking 3. safe mode with command prompt 4. last known good configuration (your most recent settings that worked) 5. start windows normally i tried them all and none worked. i disconnected the dvd burner and still none worked. the computer kept restarting after trying every option. when i selected safe mode, a bunch of files loaded, then it restarted anyway. the farthest the computer starting up progress goes, is to the windows sign where it then restarts. can someone help please. i have files that are very important to my job on it. tell me if there is anything else u want to know.
