(the maxtor isn't &quot;found&quot; on the laptop) there's no way easy to find a help area for this thing & i'm a novice to it all. damn. all i really wanna do is store stuff (esp. music) from my laptop to the maxtor. thanks in advance

(though admittedly, i don't do it often) should i uninstall/reinstall or might that screw things up?
