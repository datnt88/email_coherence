14123	9	244691	2480249	2469225	terry155	5/7/07 7:24 am	1.17852264e12	network problems solved!	i received my plk200 and ple200 last week and really gave them a workout over the weekend. i tried them in every obscure location in my house and am extremely happy with the results. no dropped signal; constant signal strength; and virtually no hiccups. the set up wizard was extremely easy. hadn't thought about the encryption, so i'll go back and set that up. the only complaint i have with the units is the ethernet cable that is included is only 3-4 long and barely reached from my router to the wall outlet, so i had to buy some longer cables.
