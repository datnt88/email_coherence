868	2	118582	1345636	1345557	fouad bakht	8/7/05 7:40 am	1.1234004e12	true	this is something you, me and few others may understand but most people like the idea of &quot;one-button recovery with no-disks-to-lose solution&quot; and probably dont consider the cons. i initially gave them the idea of a single dvd-rom based recovery solution and i think i'll press on with it. so whats your advice on this one??

868	5	118582	1345983	1345951	r. proffitt	8/7/05 11:50 am	1.1234154e12	pricey.	have you asked them for the numbers? it's a shocker. linux images are a fav but i can't teach that here. it's a trick of linux and it's fdisk, dd and maybe gzip. when it works it's a great thing and the price is time to make it work.  is another software i find on some laptops and more of those external usb drives for restoring an image. again, you pay for such a priviledge.
