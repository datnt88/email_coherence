8524	5	168518	1865696	1865096	csl92701	4/9/06 8:52 am	1.14457272e12	great link	that's excellent- thank you sir!

8524	8	168518	1866431	1864726	tien-avenger	4/9/06 7:55 pm	1.1446125e12	what about....	is anyone taking into concideration that there's not a lot of software out there to fully take advantage of the dual core's features and processing powers? it's new...let it sit for a while and let software catch up before you dish out some money due to hype and vibe. the way i see it a dual core system is a playstation2 when it first came out. and everyone's playing ps1 games on it thinking they're modern and in the loop. well imagine how much better when there are more ps2 games designed to run on the ps2. but hey that's just me
8524	9	168518	1868274	1866431	nathanpsz2	4/10/06 7:47 pm	1.14469842e12	dual core is good for...	...heavy multitaskers who use photoshop and flash at the same time as they have documents, spreadsheets, and browser windows open.

8524	11	168518	1871131	1864726	mjcntn	4/12/06 6:32 am	1.14482352e12	great string	this is a topic that lots of people will have differnt things to suggest. people out there, wanting to upgrade, or build a new system now, sometimes can't wait (my intel system just crashed) and with all the newly developing options and outlooks make things more confusing than ever. as for what was said about waiting for the newer amd board, supporting faster memory, in most situations todays memory should be good enough... right? the question burning me up right now, is what current specs will be needed for future developments (os, dual core, 64bit, meory speed), and what will be optional/benificial.
8524	12	168518	1878590	1866431	3rdalbum	4/15/06 9:43 pm	1.14513738e12	not quite correct	i think you might be getting confused with 64-bit. as long as the operating system deals with dual-core processors correctly, the applications don't need to do anything extra to support them. win xp pro can take two threads of a normal application and run them through seperate cores. mac os x does the same thing. the linux smp kernel does it too. some programs might crash if run on a multi-core machine on a system which supports it, but that's something different. 64-bit support, on the other hand, needs to be coded into applications. ----------- may i just add that dual-core processors are good for thin-client situations? on linux, you can have all tasks performed by a server, and have many thin clients which just transmit key presses and mouse movements, and recieve screen image in return (well, it's not actually a screen image, but that's just the easiest way to describe it). a multiple-core processor works wonders in these servers, as programs can then run in each core.
