14122	4	100892	1165759	1161736	ihop4no1	5/2/05 8:40 am	1.1150232e12	you're right, but...	yes, i have the logitech x-530's (5.1 surround) and if i set the speaker configuration for either 2.1 or headphones, i can then enable hardware acceleration (and hear it). however, this defeats the purpose of having 5.1 sound, since i'm loosing the center channel and the two rear satellites. also, the sound is better if i just leave hardware acceleration off and set the speaker configuration to 5.1. there is no &quot;matrix&quot; button...i'm not sure what that is - whether it's part of the software for the sound card or if you're referring to the speakers themselves. i'm pretty sure that i just need to upgrade to a little better card that supports hardware buffering/acceleration (like the creative audigy 2 value sb0400). thanks for the update.
14122	5	100892	1166726	1165759	ozos	5/2/05 6:57 pm	1.11506022e12	-	hmmm matrix is on my z-640's and the z-640's are basically &quot;last year's model&quot; of the x-530 let me look up a picture of the x-530 and see if i can identify what your version of it is hmmm can't seem to find it on the z-640's it's located next to the knob which adjusts the center volume but i don't see anything like that on the 530's hmmm go into the thx console and tell it that you have 5.1 speakers then go into windows' thing and tell it that you have 5.1 speakers then try it and if it doesn't work it might just be the sound card (i've only tried it on my audigy 2 zs plat., never even tried it on the soundstorm integrated on my mobo)

(this is an el cheapo sound card - it's the sound blaster live! digital 5.1. got it basically for free, but it's like two seasons ago model! box says &quot;certified for windows 2000&quot; ha!) so, i think when the money flows, i'll look into one of the audigy's. by the way, how you like that audigy 2 zs? it looks like an outstanding card.

(anybody out there want to buy a 1 gb stick of memory? ) i'm tempted to return/exchange the memory (rosewill ddr 400) but i'm a little aggravated at the process. rosewill, although it guarantees the memory for life (why i purchased their brand in the first place), claims i must go through the vendor if not purchased through them. well, the vendor, chiefvalue, requires that i pay to ship it back and pay a 15% restocking fee. i understand this is pretty standard since newegg has the same policy. probably if i had discovered this within 30 days of purchase it would have been easier to return/exchange, but as we all know, diagnosing computer issues can take a lot of time (switching parts, rebooting, removing components, reinstalling, uninstalling, etc.). plus, i wasnt sure if it was a hardware or software issue. oh well. two final notes; 1.

(looks like you simply put the cd in the tray, select the option to upgrade the bios and that's all there is to it - hopefully!) questions; 1. which of the above two options should i use? 2. i don't have a floppy. can i use a memory stick? 3. by the way, i've never flashed the bios before. i admit, i'm intimidated. thanks! btw, thank's for the info on the tool that won't work on systems above 1 gb memory. sounds like something that may be relevant. graham
