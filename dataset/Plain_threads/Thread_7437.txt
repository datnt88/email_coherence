9868	0	236769	2420442	nr	efisher506	3/4/07 10:02 am	1.17300252e12	cpu trouble	i recently built a new machine. the processors i chose was an amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core, 5200+. up until yesterday, everything was fine. i was running at optimal processor speed and when i checked properties of my computer, it reported as much. today, i logged in and checked properties of my computer for a totally seperate reason and saw that the cpu was being reported as running at 996mhz instead of the usualy 2.6ghz. my mobo came with a utility that i can run to dynamically bump the speed of my cpu up, but i am reluctant to try it, as i have no experience overclocking. what could cause this change? should i be concerned about it? should i make the change in the utility i have, or is there another utility i can use? please help, eric
