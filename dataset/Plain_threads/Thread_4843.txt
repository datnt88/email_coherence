(home networ	we had a home network set up for us about 1 1/2 years ago. we mostly just use it to share the dsl internet connection as well as access a printer from one of our computers. i am having difficulty accessing the internet and believe that i have isolated thhe problem to a router that has gone bad (i.e., if i bypass the router the internet works fine). so, i will be buying a new router. question is . . . can i just buy the same one and plug everything into the new one the same as the old one? or do i need to find someone to re-set up the network again. (the last guy went out of business and i don't have another computer guy yet.) many thanks in advance for your advice.
