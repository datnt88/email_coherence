5534	2	571670	5354473	5354293	dianneemma	8/31/12 3:05 pm	1.3464255e12	thanks	it would be of more help if you would be able to offer suggestions rather than point out flaws. yes, wifi is open and, therefore, never secure. i am not ruling out third party interference, but given our environment i am not leaning in that direction. there have never been firmware updates for the router, so it is obviously up-to-date, but again your willingness to waste my time with your lack of suggestion is noted. the router has always been set to wpa2 personal. i read through the introductory troubleshooting posts of this forum, which were of no real help solving my problem. perhaps i am missing something. i do not understand why a network that worked flawlessly for a year would suddenly and randomly become sporadic. i do not understand why the devices &quot;see&quot; the network when they are disconnected yet cannot connect to it until the router is rebooted. i am seeking suggestions and advice, not condescending attitude.

5534	8	571670	5365702	5365569	dxjanis	9/25/12 1:25 pm	1.3485795e12	get the maker to fix my gear	as i said in my original post, i contacted belkin. their only suggestion was a firmware update. which was available, so i updated. the result has been; no change. the previous router was a belkin, also. maybe i ought to get a cisco or something. frankly, i suspect the industry just doesn't care if they produce junk. they know we'll buy it and after the sale, it's all on the consumer. probably, if i spent big bucks, i'd be able to get a good router. we never had this issue where i worked. but i'll bet they spent thousands on hardware. i'm not that much of a high-roller. i've been through the book for my router. it doesn't even suggest such a failure might be possible. i've looked at all of the settings and read all of the &quot;what's this&quot; pop-ups. i'm stumped. my hope was that someone on this forum could suggest a real solution. i guess not.
5534	9	571670	5366272	5365702	r. proffitt	9/26/12 2:55 pm	1.3486713e12	i have some workarounds.	at the top of this forum is a sticky. it should show the usual advice. 1. latest firmware or if the support folk suggest a specific version, then that version. 2. router defaults!!! i am no longer explaining why hiding the ssid creates issues as well as never adds to security. 3. move to wpa2 aes personal security after it is working. 4. torrents? no complaining as you know why. 5. we have more tweaks such as pushing the 802.11n router back to 802.11g only. can help cranky routers. -&gt; these are not &quot;real solutions&quot; but real workarounds. bob
