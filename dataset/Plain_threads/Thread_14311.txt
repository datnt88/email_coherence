(actual drive space will be less but its easier to understand this way). the advantage of creating partitions like in example 2), is if you only use c: for your os and to install applications and drive d: to store all your data, you can format the c: drive and reinstall your os, without moving your data on the d: drive. in this way your computer will get more organized (not faster nor safer). but remember. if the harddisk crash both drive c: and d: will be lost.
