(netgear wpn802 was a huge advance over my earlier smc products) do i have to revert to a wired solution? does the new 802.11n standard help in any way (i am more concerned about range than speed). tia joe kelly ireland

(bin = thrash can) i need the repeater because the wpn802 repeater is better at connecting to the primary than my wireless connections in the computers are and i have several. i'll check into the wpnt834. will i need two. do they have a repeater mode? joe
