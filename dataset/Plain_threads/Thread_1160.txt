(related thread:  ) i don't do any gaming or video editing so we are looking at photos, music, streaming video, etc. gateway dx4822-01 (refurb) $399

7924	7	388988	3278755	3278679	thegibson	3/31/10 2:22 pm	1.27004532e12	wow	i guess i'm just shocked that there's $160 worth of value in the processor considering i'm going to void the warranty the minute i get home. i wasn't expecting that. does anyone else agree?

7924	9	388988	3278919	3278885	thegibson	3/31/10 6:34 pm	1.27006044e12	okay.	... but i don't render video. i might rip some dvd's so i have backups for my kids, but rendering video is not something i know how to do or am looking to learn.
7924	10	388988	3279059	3278919	r. proffitt	4/1/10 4:05 am	1.2700947e12	ripping a dvd involves rendering.	all and i mean all dvd rippers i've seen render some of the dvd to get an idea of what to do with the dvd. if you want to make a less than great upgrade to a value only box then do that. at least someone warned you. bob
7924	11	388988	3279086	3279059	thegibson	4/1/10 5:35 am	1.2701001e12	good to know.	thanks. i wasn't making the connection there.
