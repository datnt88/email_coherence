7714	6	287231	2726447	2726314	artchick	3/10/08 6:49 pm	1.20517494e12	thanks	i know the imacs come with leopard. i have a new keyboard and monitor so i was looking for just for a tower. but that may be the way to go

7714	8	287231	2727106	2726460	artchick	3/11/08 4:19 pm	1.20525234e12	you are right	i went to the mac store today and the sales guy told me that i should base my decision on what i can afford . i decided i am going to get an imac for now and then in a year or two when i have more $$ i will invest in the mac pro.i am going to research and see if i can sell my g4 and get something for it. plus i just applied for a mac visa credit card and well see if i am approved. * all the advantages of a visa credit card * no interest for up to 90 days for today's purchase (2) * itunes reward points with every purchase * open line of credit up to $25,000 (4) * no prepayment penalty * no annual fee * flexible spending
