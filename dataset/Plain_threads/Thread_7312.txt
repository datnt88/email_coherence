4287	3	311544	2877379	2877356	r. proffitt	10/8/08 6:50 pm	1.2234918e12	then the adapter is ng?	a similar adapter is in my kit bag. but it confuses people as it's swaps pins around.

4287	5	311544	2877368	2877380	allenv30	10/8/08 7:04 pm	1.22349264e12	what do you mean	what exactly do you mean by share your pairing. i thought you were talking about the color code. ow, o, gw, b,bw,g,brownw,brown i am not sure if that is what you want. it is just standard setup.
4287	6	311544	2877369	2877368	allenv30	10/8/08 7:05 pm	1.2234927e12	forgot	the coupler is a straight through and i already tested it on other lines and works great. female to female.
4287	7	311544	2877776	2877368	r. proffitt	10/9/08 9:45 am	1.2235455e12	think about it.	the same colours do not connect in a straight through the coupler. that's why there are 2 types of this coupler.
4287	8	311544	2877786	2877776	allenv30	10/9/08 10:16 am	1.22354736e12	i thought of that	i did test that with the cable tester, it was all good, this coupler is a straight thru shot. i also used another wall jack as well. still the same results. it just seems to be very difficult. the only other thing i can think of is that the cable tester has gone bad. but i have been using it for some time with no problems. just wired up an entire office with it, and everything was a go. no problems at all.

4287	16	311544	2878005	2877986	allenv30	10/9/08 12:24 pm	1.22355504e12	i havn't done everything, i am sure	however, as for the pairing, its a no brainer. i have gigabit throughout the network. everything is on and perfect. am running full duplex and no problems. even with my current hookup bypassing the wall jack and going to a switch and then to the computer, it is full duplex and green all the way. this is why it is so confusing. i can terminate right at the wall jack without the jack, once the jack is hooked up, it goes dead. i have tried 4 different wall jacks with no luck. the funny part is that if i put a coupler on the end in place of the wall jack, it won't work, so i figured it was the wiring. that only makes sense. but i reran another wire and the same results. i am with you about the wiring, i still believe it is that, however i cannot seem to find it anywhere. i also had another person take a look and he gave up. i have been through several wall jacks, 4 couplers, my own cables, store bought cables. my pair testing is right on, my resistance testing is perfect. other then running a third wire from the last run, that is the best i can come up with. the only other thought is that something is interfering with the last leg of the run. i am not sure but maybe some wiring in the walls or ceiling that i didn't catch.
