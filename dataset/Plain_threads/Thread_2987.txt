10683	3	50971	608766	608710	r. proffitt	12/14/04 8:10 am	1.1030118e12	so how do you know it's not the ac line?	without an ups, a few cycles could go missing and the machine will lock up. your selection of the power supply is &quot;light&quot;. sadly, the tone of your post is &quot;it can't be that&quot;. what has to happen is you need to collect more responses and decide what you wish to do about this. denial is not going to help you here. bob

10683	7	50971	610121	609613	r. proffitt	12/14/04 5:02 pm	1.10304372e12	that's not the always it cure.	it's just one of the issues that is notable. having a just big enough supply as well as one that is over a year old doesn't let it ride out any ac power interuptions. how about this. have you contacted the place that sold you these parts? what do they suggest to do next? all the usual other items are.. 1. latest bios. 2. bios defaults. 3. only the ram they suggest. 4. case cover off. 5. rma it part by part until you find the bad part. 6. recycled parts are suspect. remove them too. bob
