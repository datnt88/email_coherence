11234	4	338636	3022882	3022879	ksgale49	4/11/09 3:30 pm	1.2394638e12	i wrote	bob, ok i will search for the processors. as to the dvr i was looking at the hauppauge hvr 1250 card to process the cable signal and the tech said this: &quot;if that is a single core system then it is recommended to have a 2.2 ghz or higher anything lower can cause issues such as stuttering video. if you have a good video card to pull some of the strain off the cpu then it could possibly work in that system but if not you will most likely experience some issues.&quot; this is digital and analog capable, but i could go down to just analog since i will be recording off my cable. compaq has integrated video processor which is crap. i'm all ears if you have a better plan. thanks again, ken

11234	7	338636	3023010	3022882	samkh	4/11/09 9:12 pm	1.23948432e12	if	your mind is made up on getting the 1250, why shop for a cpu before you have tried it in your pc? some things in life are better when serialized.

11234	9	338636	3023152	3023061	ksgale49	4/12/09 7:18 am	1.23952068e12	re: that's a good way to approach this.	good point. that is what i most likely will do, try the hvr 1250 first but at least i have some idea of what processor upgrade i can use if needed and they don't seem to be expensive. the options are not a big jump in speed either 2.2 or 2.4 ghz. what is confusing is socket 939 vs what the amd site lists sockets am, am2 and another one. i wish terms were consistant across the board. thanks again for the advice. i've bookmarked the wiki links you provided and i will read more. ken
