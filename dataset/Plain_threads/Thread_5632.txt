(since it's verizon, i'm assuming it's not cable). if it is cable, you may have to register your mac address with verizon. i did for my internet provider. check your ethernet card. make sure it's seated properly. make sure you've got a &quot;green light&quot;. if it's dsl, make sure you're using the phone filters provided by either verizon or the dsl cable modem manufacturer. if it's dial-up, make sure you've got the phone line plugged into the computer correctly. (i can't tell you how many times i've seen someone plug a phone line (rj-11) into a cable jack (rj-45)). right-click the icon and do a &quot;repair&quot; on the network connection. are you using a router or connecting straight to your connection? any other pc's able to connect? good luck!
