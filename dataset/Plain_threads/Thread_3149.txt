''can they install a bigger hard drive say 250gb and transfer over all my stuff from the 80gb hard drive without causing any problems?'' do you mean transfer everything (as in, windows (or whatever you use), apps, games, utilities, etc.), or do you mean just drag-and-drop data over? either way, the answer is yes. if you want to copy everything, though, you will need a drive-imaging app like symantec norton ghost. that program will read all the data on your 80-gb hard drive into a single file, which can be then (with ghost or whatever) be uncompressed onto your new hard drive, resulting in a perfect copy of everything. i hope i could help.
