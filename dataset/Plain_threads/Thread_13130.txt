(actually, even if the answer to #4 is no, i'd like to know how one formats a flashdrive. 6) if the package says that the flashdrive is compatible with win98se, me, 200, xp and says that is it not compatible with any other windows platform, does that mean what i thikit means? that this flashdrive would not be compatible with our other laptop which has windows vista? thanks in advance for answering! alex
