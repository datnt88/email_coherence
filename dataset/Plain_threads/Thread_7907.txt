(not the most recent either. get a mid-level athlon.) get at least 1 gig of ddram, or rambus. more than 1 cant hurt and will definitely help. dont see why you'd need more than 60-80 gig hard drive, really. how many games can you load on already in one shot? if you'll be doing heavy duty gaming you'll want a case with a good power supply and plenty of room for fans. make sure your motherboard has room to expand. make sure it has at least 4-6 usb slots. there is nothing more irritating then unplugging something so you'll have room for another usb device. usb and firewire is the future- make sure you have them.
