6507	8	290267	2752557	2744234	dango517	4/16/08 3:40 am	1.2083172e12	see link	scroll down to &quot;access and interfaces&quot;  &quot;bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect hard disk drives to buses that they cannot communicate with natively, such as ieee 1394 and usb.&quot; sourced from...wikipedia. it may not be sata or pata. i'd contact maxtor directly or search there site again for the more information.
