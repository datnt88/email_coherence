3089	8	563824	5316654	5316467	willivon4	5/29/12 12:06 pm	1.33829316e12	yeah it's xp sp3	i stated that assuming some universality since the update to it has always been free. does sp2 or sp 3 correct that hdd size problem? might that be part of the reason for asus establishing such a large d: partition on my eee pc? what about physical drive size, can it be overcome via multi-partitioning?
3089	9	563824	5318165	5316654	r. proffitt	6/2/12 3:34 pm	1.33865124e12	not that i'm a historian	but the issue was first corrected in xp sp1 so you won't have to deal with that issue in any way at all. bob
