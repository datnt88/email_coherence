(i don't want to do this becasue i use the router for qos) i would also like to be able to share a folder on the office pc so that if i work on a document on the laptop i can just copy it over to that machine for storage because i also backup everything on the office pc to off-site storage. any advice on my setup? thanks tucker

(i use mcafee firewall by the way on the office pc and symantec on my laptop since it is a work pc). also, how do i make sure it is part of the same workgroup? if this is more info then this forum can provide, is there someplace i can go to get this info? thanks
