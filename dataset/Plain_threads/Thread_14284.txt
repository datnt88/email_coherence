989	0	47802	567212	nr	anthonymdavis	11/26/04 8:15 am	1.1014569e12	16 bit windows subsystem error in xp?	i recently got a new computer (moving up from me to xp). on the old computer i had some applications that loaded up fine. yet, on the xp computer i get an error banner that says, &quot;16 bit windows subsystem&quot; the body of the error window says, &quot;c:\windows\system32\autoexec.nt. the system file is not suitable for running ms-dos and microsoft windows applications. choose 'close' to terminate the application.&quot; at the bottom are two buttons - close and ignore (nothing happens with ignore). both of these programs worked fine in the earlier version. i tried the &quot;compatibility&quot; function with no luck. i tried loading it without the xp 2 patch, and again after. these are simple apps that use a setup program. i'm out of ideas...anybody else?

989	12	47802	784764	724806	babidgood	2/23/05 8:25 am	1.1091471e12	cause of this error	we have found that there are two reasons for this; 1. running antispyware programs sometimes removes these files autoexec.nt, ntconfig.nt and command.com 2. upgrading to xp sp2 - we are not sure why this knocks out these files but it does... the fix is to replace these three files as stated in a microsoft kb article:  you can also download a quick fix from here that does the trick. you will need your xp cd ready for either way.  thanks, bruce bidgood
