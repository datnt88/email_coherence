9920	7	603019	5506198	5506173	escapepod	10/8/13 7:49 pm	1.38126174e12	maybe...	if it was free, or very low priced (make that extremely low priced).

9920	10	603019	5506231	5506173	mavericke	10/8/13 8:47 pm	1.38126522e12	depends on implementation quality, features, and cost	i use an asus transformer prime running jelly bean for note-taking and viewing documents in writing and editing classes. i use polaris office (which came with the tablet) and pro office suite. neither app can display tracked changes or multiple documents, both of which i'd like to do. my current workaround for tracked changes is to print the document with changes displayed to a pdf. i open that document in adobe, and one document each in the office apps. if ms office for android eliminated my need for the workarounds, i'd definitely consider it, provided that the implementation was reliable and reasonably priced. there may be other android apps out there now that have the features i need, but i'm pretty sure there weren't any available on google play when i went looking for them last year.

9920	12	603019	5506295	5506173	klmcats	10/9/13 4:15 am	1.3812921e12	maybe?	cost & features would be the determining factor. i have been using documents to go on various platforms for years... palm, andriod & ios. i seldom do anything from &quot;scratch&quot;, but use it to update excel & word files. for the most part i need to create an excel workbook w/ functions on pc & transfer to my mobile device. i miss database software! if reasonably priced & most of the functionality from windows - yes, i would use ms office on a mobile device in a heartbeat!
9920	13	603019	5506301	5506185	klmcats	10/9/13 4:18 am	1.38129228e12	why mobile?	i have had situations where i was standing, entering data read off into a workbook on a mobile device. most mobile devices weigh less than laptops. yes - the workbook gets transferred to pc for any major manipulation, but at least i got my data entered quickly on the fly.
9920	14	603019	5506351	5506173	kmkper	10/9/13 6:47 am	1.38130122e12	let's admit it, the world relies on microsoft office suite	even though tablet tries to cover most work aspects, when it comes to documents we really don't have strong, unified and platform independent tools. microsoft office is plays an inevitable role on every kind of business on the pc front and if the same potential can be leveraged into tablets i would definitely go for it.
9920	15	603019	5506373	5506188	ahseitz	10/9/13 9:39 am	1.38131154e12	office programs	also, i discovered that the &quot;speech-to-text&quot; option on all my android devices is re-markedly accurate and requires very little editing. (my 'old man' fat fingers need lots of editing!)

(even some really nice bt keyboard cases.) for those seriously working, they already have laptops, using office work alikes to great creations.
