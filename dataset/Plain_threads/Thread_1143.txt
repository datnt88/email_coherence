(my networking knowledge is quite basic) i am building a new house, and am setting up a home network. i have got 15 cat6 runs through out the house ( 2 of them are for external for ip cameras) all my runs will terminate back to a patch panel in my study. i am looking for a 24 port switch to work with my set up. i will need poe for my 2 ip cameras. i am looking for a rack mount, unmanaged gigabit switch. i am hoping to spend &lt;$400. any suggestions on which switch to buy? i don't want to be playing with settings etc in the switch, i want it to be plug and play. my future plans are to connect a rack mount nas (something similar to synology rs 212) does anyone have any reviews/suggestions etc? i want everything to pretty much run itself in the background. thanks

10677	9	599902	5505916	5505808	steven haninger	10/8/13 7:17 am	1.38121662e12	the only poe devices i've set up are wireless aps	i did one with 8 connections initially but expansion capability was also a desire. i would have needed 8 outlets for this setup and the injectors were already rather large. as well, 8 additional lengths of ethernet cable would have been needed. in this case, a more reasonable solution was a poe switch that matched the needs of the aps. the switch allowed individual ports to have power turned on or off through its web interface. using a poe switch just made for a neater installation. your op suggested that you were looking for a 24 port switch and that you needed poe. i presumed you meant the switch needed to supply the power and was just making sure you were aware that not all poe devices use the same standards. if you already have compatible injectors, you already have poe capability.

10677	11	599902	5511719	5490682	steven haninger	10/25/13 10:26 am	1.38269676e12	there are any number of 24 port unmanaged switches	within your price range. you might want to consider whether or not you need jumbo frame capability. since you want rack mount, you need to know these come in sizes to fit equipment of more than one width. most i've seen are 19&quot; mounts but some are about 13&quot; if your space is limited. unmanaged switches are plug and play. poe switches usually offer some options through a web interface such as whether or not to turn power on for any port. if you only have 2 poe devices, you can use injectors. if you plan to add more later, you can even add a second switch for poe devices only. poe does simplify the ac wiring scheme. anyway, if all you want is a 24 port unmanaged switch, i'd say go to a site like newegg and check cisco, netgear, etc. and you'll find plenty of basic models in the $150-$250 range.
