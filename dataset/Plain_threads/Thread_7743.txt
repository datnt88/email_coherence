(i would like to upgrade the imac to a 27&quot;.) i have a 17&quot; macbook pro for working away from my studio (why i'm against apple's doing away with optical drives in its laptops). and i have both an ipad 3 plus an 4th gen ipod touch for communicating and keeping track of things.

5275	7	562709	5308949	5308604	esunintel	5/8/12 12:11 pm	1.33647906e12	that be perfect...	i would really be willing to pay the current ipad prices for a 7&quot; version if they keep the hardware as is and don't remove the 4g capability. ...sure, a lower price would be nice, but i just want a 7&quot; version. i was playing with a smaller samsung tablet at the at&t store, and have also played with the playbook at work, and think the smaller size is perfect.

(7.0&quot; is too small) i take my ipad on trips, and it is too big! the 9.7&quot; is perfect around the house, but the more you take it with you, the more its size gets in the way. it will still be almost 4x the size of a ipod touch, so there is no overlap. kids will love the smaller size ipad mini too. if it has all the features of ipad 2 with 5mp camera with flash, it will be a great buy even for $350. apple has 3 sizes of macbook pro, 2 sizes of imac. samsung has no less then 5 sizes of its tablets! (10&quot;, 8&quot;, 7&quot;, 5&quot;, 4&quot;). so what is wrong about 2 sizes of ipad?

5275	11	562709	5309082	5308604	wwwpdx	5/8/12 3:57 pm	1.33649262e12	how about an 8&quot;	i've tried out a 7&quot; unit and would really like to see an 8&quot; product come out (apple of course). the 7&quot; ers a just a wee bit small for me.
5275	12	562709	5309064	5308604	vvolkman	5/8/12 4:06 pm	1.33649316e12	to save a hundred bucks, no way	a three-inches smaller screen just to save $100? that is ludicrous. it's going to be very tough to do email or real work on a 7-inch screen
5275	13	562709	5309122	5308604	netsiu	5/8/12 5:53 pm	1.33649958e12	what ever apple wants, apple does...	apple came out with the ipad and every one copying the kindle came oput with a pad, so why not apple with a nook/kindle copy.
5275	14	562709	5309134	5308604	gsmollin	5/8/12 7:37 pm	1.33650582e12	&quot;the hardest thing to decide is what to leave out.&quot;	quote from steve jobs. i think this idea falls under that. apple would cannibalize sales of the 10 inch ipad, and i don't think they will do that. they are also not interested in competing with kindles and the other small tablets. remember apple never produced a netbook. as a product line, they were too cheap. as for me, i already have an ipad, so no, i won't be interested. i won't be buying another tablet until somebody comes out with a real tablet computer worth buying. i mean something serious, not hobbled and tied to itunes, a real tablet computer the size and weight of a ipad. tell me about that.

5275	16	562709	5309339	5308604	quixoti	5/9/12 2:39 pm	1.33657434e12	would you buy a 7-inch apple ipad for $250.00?	this won't happen. apple cannot risk it's reputation of selling equipment for twice the going rate for similar equipment. and, the apple consumer would surely be disillusioned at paying less than the current 100% premium for the &quot;apple&quot; logo.

5275	18	562709	5313288	5308604	batman	5/20/12 3:17 pm	1.33752702e12	nope	but hey, everyone seems to be so (dare i say this?) &quot;big&quot; on small; so, why not go for a 1/2 inch screen? instead of carrying an mp3 player, tablet, cell phone, watch, pen, wallet, handkerchief, why not make it all one device? dick tracy, anyone? seriously. i don't even get the obsession with smaller. carrying something smaller is understandable, but, let's see, there's the i-pod/mp3 player, cell phone, and gadget after gadget. while i am considering a tablet/e-reader, i fear the small screen will make it hard to actually read; and, watch tv or a movie from it? on a 7-9 inch screen? really? i enjoy the luxury of my 17&quot; laptop, for the one reason, i can actually see it. but, that's just me. on another note, i have been considering a kindle fire. has amazon fixed their security issues? or, was that update just another worthless promise? thanks.
