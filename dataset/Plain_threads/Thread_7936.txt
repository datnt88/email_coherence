4262	4	306949	2847744	2847720	vapcmd	9/2/08 5:25 am	1.2203331e12	what's the basis for getting a 1,000 watt psu at $196	when there are outstanding psus with more watts and amps than you need for $50-$60 less ?   vapcmd

4262	6	306949	2848374	2847728	vapcmd	9/2/08 7:36 pm	1.22038416e12	ran your components over one of the more comprehensive psu	calculators and it calculated your current psu requirement at 338 watts. if you add another 4870 gpu, another hdd, another dvd plus 4 usbs and 2 120mm fan it only calls for psu with 527 watts &lt;40 amps. i'm a firm believer in capacity or room to grow but a 1000 watt psu for a system requiring less than 350 watt or 527 watts is over the top even for this builder of 22 years. good luck on your choices and your build. vapcmd
