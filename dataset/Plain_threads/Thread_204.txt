3893	3	63771	756874	756842	r. proffitt	2/11/05 10:25 am	1.1081175e12	i didn't see a write protect &quot;switch&quot;.	there have been attempts to do so in software or via file systems, but this doesn't work like the solid switch or slide on floppies (remember those) or tapes. cdr/w and dvdr/w are rendered unwritable by placing such in a dvd or cd drive that can't write. this area is full of solutions but no one can agree on best. the usual office backup is a central server to store the files that need backup, then some tape drive to cart the data off site in case of a disaster. this all starts when the person responsible writes... &quot;my business's disaster recovery plan&quot;. the drive you spoke of will do in a pinch, but is not &quot;backup&quot;. it's a volatile copy. bob
