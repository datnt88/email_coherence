12550	3	548371	5236641	5236350	junk849	11/26/11 7:20 am	1.322292e12	that's helpful..., but not really.	are you saying if i pay $89 for a thumb drive it's better than the $20 thumb drive just because it cost more? that's the whole reason i posted the question in the first place. i haven't seen any reviews on thumb drives, except from retail outlets that wanted to sell them.

12550	13	548371	5240451	5236641	richteral	12/3/11 5:37 am	1.32289062e12	i am afraid	kenhusveg is, more or less, right. usb sticks are generally cheap, and they do fail over time. so that would cover that. as for brands, some would swear by sandisk; based on personal experience, i certainly do not. the thing that has lasted me the longest so far, is a 256 mb sony. you may care to look at  incl. the comments. my choice for reliability is sd cards mounted as usb sticks, since they beat even optical disks.
