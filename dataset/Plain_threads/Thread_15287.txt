(without changing the router configuration back and forth...) i thought of, having 2(two) access point, using different channel, but one of the ap is open (no security - but it will be turn on/off as necessary) -- if this configuration is possible, can both ap (different channel) still share a file or printer? -- any information or idea is appreciated thank you
