3416	5	244210	2469571	2469405	ramarc	4/25/07 12:34 pm	1.17750444e12	600w for a non-sli system is overkill	even an 8800gts 640mb card only specifies a 450w power supply. here are actual power draw figures of a similar pc with a core2extreme x6800 cpu and various 8800gts video card:  as for the comment, he's complaining about the motherboard/bios (increasing cpu voltage helps in overclocking), not the power supply. power supplies deliver pre-determined voltages (3.3v, 5v, 12v, etc.); only the mobo can deliver a custom voltage to the cpu. any of the power supply brands you mention are fine choices.
