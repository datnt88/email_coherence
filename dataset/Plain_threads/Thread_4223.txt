1595	2	255527	2534887	2534195	vt53040	7/9/07 5:02 am	1.18395732e12	yahoo...	yahoo is the browser, but i need to go through internet explorer to get to it. with vista, i don't have a dedicated icon anymore like i did with xp, why? i don't know. should i download a newer version of ie? i'm running the latest (7x).
1595	3	255527	2535025	2534887	ozos	7/9/07 7:58 am	1.18396788e12	well	it might not be vista compatable, which might explain why it isn't working. if all you're wanting is the icon back, just right click on the .exe and create a shortcut, and drag that onto your desktop. also, i'd generally suggest firefox or opera as web browsers.

1595	5	255527	2535736	2535105	ozos	7/10/07 6:36 am	1.18404936e12	yes, most systems include ie	which was the basis for a supreme court case involving microsoft and the doj. firefox is entirely free, cnet might have it on download.com (probably does). but  also works. i'm not sure what your actual problem is, given that i don't understand your explanation of using the yahoo browser &quot;through&quot; internet explorer. if you mean the yahoo toolbar thats a different thing.

(i was using the term &quot;browser&quot; wrong in the previous post, sorry). i got rid of ie, and downloaded the latest firefox, imported my yahoo toolbar, etc...and wow! things are soooooooooooooo much faster!!! no hanging, no freezing! amazing!!!! i wish i knew about firefox before. even the typing issues i've had in the past have gone away! i knew it had something to do with my homepage, but i was assuming it was because of yahoo, not ie. what makes firefox so superior to ie?????
