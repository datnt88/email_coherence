14832	9	156835	1742097	1741931	pretty_lady	2/14/06 4:34 am	1.13989164e12	that's good to hear...	because, you're right, hp doesn't offer to install higher power supply units. i found the specs on this pc and it comes with 400 watts of power, so after your comments about the video cards i am more than happy to leave things alone in the power department.
14832	10	156835	1742177	1741918	pretty_lady	2/14/06 5:29 am	1.13989494e12	vista sounds good	i read a lot of the storage forum discussions and some of the other sites you mentioned for backup information and came to the conclusion that i'd use norton ghost to backup to a notebook that i plan on buying once i'm done with the pc configuration etc. it seems that i'll be able to backup the pc to the notebook and the notebook to the pc using a wireless network that i intend on figuring out. however, it seems that i wouldn't need to buy norton ghost if i had the windows vista instead, as the review i read for vista says that it will have a super backup program. do you know if vista is coming out soon or are new operating systems easy and relatively cheap to upgrade to if you already have a windows operating system installed?
