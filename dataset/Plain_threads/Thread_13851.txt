11027	5	263330	2580528	2579459	robbertom	9/8/07 7:16 pm	1.18927896e12	here's what i have observed...	i have information: now, i noticed that my usb ports are not working whenever i press fn+f2 to deactivate my wireless. my laptop can't see any flash drives i plug in after turning off the wireless. the bluetooth manager also hangs. windows also freezes when shutting down. wireless internet works fine. when i restart the machine, everything is back to normal (usb ports, bluetooth work again). i don't know what's happening. but below is a breakdown let say i just turned on my laptop: 1. with the wireless off, the usb ports work perfectly fine. 2. when i press fn+f2 to activate the wireless/bluetooth, usb ports still work fine. 3. when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wireless, usb ports don't work, and bluetooth also doesn't work. in the device manager, if i press fn+f2 to turn the wireless internet (wi-fi) on, under &quot;universal serial bus controllers&quot;, the dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card will appear. there should also be a sound as a sign that a new device installed/connected. then, when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wireless internet, dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card disappears from device manager. there should be also a sound that signals that a device is removed. what happens is that the &quot;dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card&quot; entry is not removed when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wi-fi. it is stuck there, and my usb ports are broken. for now, as a temporary solution, i have disabled the &quot;dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card&quot; in the device manager. still haven't encountered the problem yet.
