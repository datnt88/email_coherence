9779	0	232047	2394827	nr	snypatrix	2/4/07 2:25 pm	1.1705991e12	looking to build something new, from something old	emachines t4165 system specs type of system: desktops/servers bus architecture: pci/agp hard drive bus: eide native os: windows xp home cpu type: 1.6ghz intel pentium 4 memory specs standard memory: 256 mb (removable) maximum memory: 2 gb memory expansion: 2 sockets memory comments: pc100/pc133 sdram modules it has a cd/rw and a dvd drive. the graphics card is a nvidia tnt2 64mb.it also has a 60gb hard drive. thats my old comkputer. it got fried so i assume it took out the motherboard and power supply. i have $400 to spend on a new system and i could use parts from my old one, maybe the cd r/w, dvd drive, and hard drive. so i would need a new motherboard, cpu, power supply, maybe case, more ram definately, and maybe a graphics card if there isn't built in graphics. i prety much want the most for the money with it being upgradeable in the future. any help is very much appreciated. i don't think you are allowed to link places but if you want to send some specific links to parts and such you can email me at lxtrix@gmail.com
