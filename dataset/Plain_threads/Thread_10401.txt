(code 41) under the scsi/raid controllers, i get this: windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (code 19) i cannot reinstall win xp without a cd rom drive and cannot install drivers without redoing xp? completely at a loss. this is my baby, i built her in 2003, and i can't fix her for the 1st time!
