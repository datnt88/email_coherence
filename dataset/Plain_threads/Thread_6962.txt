559	2	539494	5193420	5193381	blazin65	8/27/11 9:52 am	1.31443872e12	thank you!	i changed them to wpa2 wireless security enhanced on the router and wpa2 personal on the laptop. we'll see if i have to unplug everything tomorrow morning. even though i restarted and everything worked, it's always the next day that is the problem. as far as tkip, aes, i have always had it as tkip. i thought someone told me at one time to always use tkip. does anyone else have any additional comment on tkip or aes?
