i just purchased an hp n7060m media center pc. and, boy, it's a chore adding other xp-compatible software to it. i guess hp does not want you to add your own collection of (xp-compatible) software products to it. since it will not recognize my cakewalk music creator 2003 software, does anybody have a suggestion of another music-type creator software product that i can buy that will work with the hp n7060m? thanks, r
what do you mean &quot;wont recognize my cakewalk music creator 2003 software&quot;? what error do you get? john
perhaps it is because of  check to see if you have direct x 9. type (in run) dxdiag then click ok. or, maybe register and ask cakewalk support about that problem.
what exactly is hapening with cakewalk music creator 2003. please be aware that it is most likely not a hp issue. i can probably help you. here is one suggestion on the cakewalk forum  the thread is related to the version of direct x that you have installed. for reference the 7060 comes with dx9 as is standard with windows xp sp2 and media center 2005 (basicly windows xp pro with sp2. i would search cakewalk's user support forum for help with their products.
thanks for your suggestion...and it worked...to a point. i got cakewalk creator 2003 to load onto my hp m7060n system, however, the recording function does not work. when i try to record with a microphone - no sound is measured on the volume meter. i get a message that my computer's realtek sound card is not compatible with cakewalk creator 2003 drivers. am i sol? is there a driver i can download from hp or cakewalk? very frustrating.
