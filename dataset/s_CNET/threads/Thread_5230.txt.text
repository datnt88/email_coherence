has anyone refilled any canon printer ink cartridges?
ive refilled epson cartridges for 2 different printers, it's risky, but potentially cost saving
yes, i refilled the individual color cartridges for several years and had no trouble. i let the printer set for 6 months(gave to son when bought another) and then it wouldn't print. canon wanted 3x price of new printer - price had dropped considerably since i bought it - for new print head. as long as i used it - had no problem and saved a lot of money. the printer was great 600 dpi but wanted more dpi for photos. gn
i am on my second canon printer, gave the first to my daughter for college. i have always refilled my cartridges, either with a kit from costco, or one purchased over the internet. i have never had a problem, even refilling numerous times per cartridge. just follow the instructions carefully and have lots of tissue nearby for some minor leaking after refill. it will soon stop and you can replace cartridge in printer and continue on with your projects. you will have to override your printer color functions, but the printer will wlak you thru that process. you will not be able to track ink usage after this step, but i just check them often. teletina250
