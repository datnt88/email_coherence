12680	9	515509	5073355	5073342	r. proffitt	1/29/11 7:11 pm	1.29632826e12	sorry no.	i had hoped for details about firmware version of the 614, any setting different from defaults and such. without those i can't comment if one or another would create an issue. but the 614 is what it is. while a &quot;maximum performance dual-band wireless-n router&quot; is a nice idea we didn't get the details about the 614 out so you might repeat the same settings on a better router and complain same. bob
