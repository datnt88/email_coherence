i have a home entertainment system setup with a toshiba hdtv as a second monitor. it works fine, except that both monitors keep on resetting their resolutions upon boot-up. both monitors would normalized to their original resolutions if i launch media center (in full screen) and then close it. i use a norwood micro 15.4&quot; lcd as my primary monitor set to 1024 x 768, and the toshiba 62hm15a 62&quot; dlp projection hdtv as my secondary monitor set to 1280 x 720. both are maximum settings. the display is set-up to &quot;extend windows desktop&quot; onto the toshiba. any advice is greatly appreciated. dimension 5150/e510 windows xp mce 2005 ati radeon x600 256mb pci express video card x 2 intel pentium d cpu 2.80ghz norwood micro 15.4&quot; lcd monitor toshiba 62hm15a 62 dlp projection hdtv
ok ...i've seen your post . try to change the frequency on the second monitor(yours toshiba hdtv-it might work) and it only reseting if the second monitor is connected? did you clone the secondary monitor? vga? comosite? s-video? hdmi? how did you connect the second monitor. because it seem to be the issue with that one. if you say no....than connect toshiba hdmi or vga to your computer and make it primary screen .try to play around with your video card settings. good luck. marius
the toshiba is connected via dvi-hdmi cable. the desktop is extended onto this monitor, rather than cloned so i can still use the computer while watching movies. the problem persists whether i list the toshiba as the primary or secondary monitor. i've tried playing around with the video card settings before posting without success. i do not know how to change the frequency on the toshiba. i've checked the manual and did a web search without getting any info.
it's not a windows thing.
will check it out & keep you updated
went to ati web site & upgraded the driver and the system works like a charm. thanks again!
