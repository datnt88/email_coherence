<s> we own a business that tapes auditions for actors.  </s>
<s> we tape on a canon vixia hf-10 onto an sd card and the format is avchd.  </s>
<s> i am looking for a low cost way to take the chip out, put it into a netbook, view them, and then upload the videos they want to our secure server.  </s>
<s> no need to edit the clips.  </s>
<s> after scouring online, i discovered the new lenovo s12 comes equipped with the ion nvidia graphics engine.  </s>
<s> is that the best option?  </s>
<s> or will an asus eee be able to handle that?  </s>
<s> i am a mac person, so i know nothing about windows based machines.  </s>
<s> any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> play the clip from the camcorder to some hdtv.  </s>
<s> this sidesteps all the issues of playback on a netbook.  </s>
<s> and if you ask if it will play, it might but only you can tell by testing it.  </s>
<s> i know i could use a video converter (i use super) to make it into something playable but if we skip the netbook for playback we now have a cheap uploader.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> good call.  </s>
<s> i will go to best buy and try out a few netbooks.  </s>
<s> linking the canon hf10 to an hdtv is the easiest but we don't have one at the office.  </s>
<s> currently, we are using a macbook pro.  </s>
<s> this machine will not be avail to us soon. the mb pro plays the clips fine through imovie (compressed of course).  </s>
<s> to focus my question more, we need the same out of a netbook.  </s>
<s> just wasn't sure which one.  </s>
<s> i'll test it on your average acer netbook.  </s>
<s> especially coming from a mb pro, i fear you'll be disappointed and annoyed with trying to netbook for this kind of work.  </s>
