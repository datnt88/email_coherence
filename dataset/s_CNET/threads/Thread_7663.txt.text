i have had a dell inspiron 1300 notebook for almost a year which i primarily use to surf the web and send and receive emails. a few days ago i purchased quicken basic 2007 and installed it on the notebook. at the end of the day when i close out my quicken i'm prompted to back up my data. i haven't backed it up yet but would like to do so. on an old desktop pc i used floppies to back up my quicken data. this dell notebook doesn't have a floppy drive but i could buy an external floppy drive to use to back up the quicken data but are there other ways available to back up the data? easier; less expensive ways to back up the data? big steve biloxi, mississippi 01/13/07
nobody is willing to offer me any advice on how best to go about backing up quicken data or any data on a notebook? if this isn't the correct forum to post such a question advise which forum is. i guess i should post this one in the &quot;computer newbies&quot; forum. big steve biloxi, mississippi 01/14/07
go to quicken 2007 support enter the following in the search box: how do i back up my quicken data file?
thanks for the post. big steve biloxi, mississippi 01/14/07
hi -searched the forum and found your old question regarding quicken 2007! how did you make out with that? i have xp so needless to say, i have learned the hard way, that simply backing up on a cd like we did in the 'old' days, by selecting a drive and backing up on a floppy just isn't possible! according to microsoft, in order for quicken to write a back up file directly to the cd-r or cd-rw, the compact disc must first be formatted and support 'packet writing'. the windows xp cd recording program does not support packet writing and does not contain a feature to format a recordable cd. so, i have an external hard drive backing it up but i still long for a way to format the re-writable cd's. i know some people are using a staging area saving method which, again, is just too complicated. any suggestions? thanks, archer.....
