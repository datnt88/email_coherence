win xp, 1.7 ghtz, 512ram, 60gb boot drive and 120gb slave. i have itunes on both drives. i want many songs on my 120gb slave but not on the boot drive. every time i put songs on the slave they are automatically copied onto the boot drive. is there a simple way to avoid this? thank you.
you probably have the option enabled in itunes to copy songs to the itunes folder when you add them to the library. disable that, and make sure you place the itunes folder in the correct location and you should be all set.
thank you for the reply. i checked, and this selection: &quot;copy files to itunes music folder when adding to library.&quot; is not checked. is there another possibility?
