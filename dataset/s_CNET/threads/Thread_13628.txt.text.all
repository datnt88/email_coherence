<s> i got a new computer.  </s>
<s> and i want to get opins what to do with the old one.  </s>
<s> specs: hd = 80 gig win xp home edition amd athlon 64 processor speed 2160 mhz installed mem = 1 gig model hp a1330e i have it up for sale for $125 but getting practically no replies.  </s>
<s> so i'm thinking of dismantling it and selling off the parts.  </s>
<s> however, i don't know how to wipe the hard drive clean.  </s>
<s> totally clean.  </s>
<s> step by step instructions thanks.  </s>
<s> do you think it's better to dismantle and sell parts?  </s>
<s> i saw an all too similar machine on freecycle (a place where things are freely recycled) albeit with 512mb ram and a 40gb drive.  </s>
<s> so your price might be above the impulse level.  </s>
<s> try 99 bucks.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'll reduce the price and see what happens, but ultimately i'll prob.  </s>
<s> sell the parts.  </s>
<s> if you want to be done with it, sell it for $50-75 to include the s/w bundle that came with it, to include the restore/recovery cds if so supplied.  </s>
<s> because, once you've reformatted or wipe the hd clean 100% you will be cleaning out also the &quot;hidden partition&quot; of the hd supplied recovery/restore process.  </s>
<s> in such cases the extra cost of getting the cds if needed will go against you if the buyer needs them.  </s>
<s> your system or similar is very common, so don't be too high on sale price and remember its old stuff.  </s>
<s> understand a brand new system of entry offerings to include laptops are in the $300+ range on sale or not.  </s>
<s> to wipe clean the hd of any install entirely use dban or killdisk, google for them.  </s>
<s> of course, save any critical data you deem important.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> the sad fact is that these older machines aren't really worth anything, either intact or as parts.  </s>
<s> you might sell the hard drive and the memory but not much else.  </s>
<s> however, there are charities that can use them, assuming they are fully working.  </s>
<s> here in the uk, there is an organization called computeraid that will take an older system, check it out and recycle it to under-privileged children in the third world.  </s>
<s> i guess you can probably find such an organization where you live.  </s>
<s> while you should wipe your hard disk (i think partition wizard - find it on the web - will do it for you but there are many such cleaners available fro free) if you find the right recycler, they will also ensure the hdd is clean.  </s>
<s> they take all kinds of information about your equipment (or software, or whatever you'll be contributing), including the age, what shape the stuff is in and so on.  </s>
<s> then, if any organization is interested, they'll notify you that someone is interested, and an exchange can be made.  </s>
<s> i seem to remember that you even can say that the people need to pick the thing(s) up, but you also can arrange to send it.  </s>
<s> i don't think that they will do repairs, though those who receive the donation may be willing to do so if the donation is salvageable.  </s>
<s> ncf also gives you a figure for the tax deduction, and the donee will give you a receipt.  </s>
<s> there is much online about charitable giving of computers and such.  </s>
<s> check it out, if national cristina foundation doesn't work for you.  </s>
<s> there may also be nonprofits in your area that need what you have to offer.  </s>
<s> in any case you'll get a tax deduction and get the stuff out of your house.  </s>
<s> give away to local school or maybe neighbor, i gave a similar older computer to my stepdaughter and another to a neighbor who had school-age kids yet couldn't afford to buy a computer.  </s>
<s> both partys were very happy, since they just wanted to get on the internet and do homework.  </s>
<s> i might have gotten $25-$50 out of the computers but neither had that much and i was happy to keep them out of the landfill.  </s>
<s> to make hd data unrecoverable, first delete it.  </s>
<s> then over-write where it was (and where rit can be recovered from) by filling the free space with garbage files.  </s>
<s> fill a folder with pictures, for instance, then makes endless copies of the folder until the hd runs out of space.  </s>
<s> this'll make the data unrecoverable to anyone other than the cia.  </s>
<s> can someone tell me if i can un-track this message threads  </s>
<s> i suggest selling your bulk leftover memory to .  </s>
<s> they gave me a fare price on the ram i had just sitting in my drawer.  </s>
<s> i heard they also buy used processors and server hardware.  </s>
<s> definitely worth a look  </s>
