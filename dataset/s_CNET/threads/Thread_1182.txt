582	6	285266	2714614	2714597	sgt fury	2/25/08 2:01 pm	1.20394806e12	wrong media	sgt fury is a character created by the greaseman, a once popular dj in dc/maryland. one of the first shock jocks.
582	7	285266	2714626	2714614	ramarc	2/25/08 2:34 pm	1.20395004e12	i remember the greaseman	too bad he never worked again after mlk comment (afaik). greaseman & co may have 'nick'ed the name from nick fury's original comic: &quot;sgt. fury and his howling commandos.&quot;
