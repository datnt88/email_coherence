<s> for recording security cameras on your pc?  </s>
<s> sorry, i can't supply the names, but we do it simple with 4, 8 port cards from places like geeks.com newegg.com and some dell pc for the host.  </s>
<s> there are those that make it more complicated, but you wonder why you would build a pc when you don't have to.  </s>

<s> i have an old 2000 computer with 512k. the computer has at least the minimum needed  </s>
<s> that's the card i'm using.  </s>
<s> but if i recall you never found closure on your old system.  </s>
<s> i can safely bet your machine might have the same issues.  </s>

<s> i had turned everything off on it and was just using it for internet.  </s>
<s> i want to format the system, reload it and turn off everything but the cd burner and put the video card in for use at work  </s>
<s> today, microsoft still does not issue an os that you can't install without most systems requiring you hunting down motherboard and more drivers.  </s>

<s> do you think i will have a problem?  </s>
<s> i shared what i thought it was.  </s>
<s> i know it's an issue that not many will run into unless they install these oses for awhile.  </s>
<s> but it's one that can haunt your every attempt.  </s>
<s> oh, since you are looking at the k-world, be aware that one installation paid dearly for not reading the manual.  </s>
<s> they didn't notice the exact words and paid up about 1,000 bucks for a tech to come out and show then how to get the video files out.  </s>
<s> they were a little incensed about it, but what can you do?  </s>

<s> would installing this card in the win2000 machine be a bad thing?  </s>
<s> i know bad is a relative term, but if you say this will not work, i won't do it.  </s>
<s> i have other options (analog)  </s>
<s> i can't tell if you will be ok given the past issues and that i never could get across what i thought it was.  </s>
<s> in short, a roll of the dice for you.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i can gamble for $100 and worst case it doesn't work, i still have the card for future use!  </s>
