<s> all i did was change the ink.  </s>
<s> i guess we've had this printer for over a year now, but only recently ran out of ink.  </s>
<s> so, put in a new cartridge.  </s>
<s> no problem.  </s>
<s> i've done this many times before w/ other printers.  </s>
<s> now, every time we turn on the printer, it prints a test page.  </s>
<s> so we quit shutting off the printer.  </s>
<s> but every time we turn on the computer, it says 'you've just changed the ink' and wants us to align the printer heads.  </s>
<s> have to cancel out of that or it prints another test page.  </s>
<s> and yes, i did align originally when i changed the ink. the printer has worked great up to now, but i can't make this problem go away.  </s>
<s> it's really irritating, to say nothing of wasting ink and paper w/ all the test pages.  </s>
<s> windows xp machine.  </s>
<s> hp all-in-one (print, scan, copy) 1350.  </s>
<s> help!?!  </s>
<s> don't cancel the &quot;alignment process&quot; follow through again and actually do the alignment.  </s>
<s> this is done in order that ink &quot;jets&quot; become proper.  </s>
<s> a test pattern is printed then you select best results, it prints again, if ok, then save and exit out.  </s>
<s> it will not repeat this process until another ink cart is replaced.  </s>
<s> i can suspect you exited out before the entire process was done and *accepted* as finished r it just got hosed.  </s>
<s> hp support website does have clues if you really did alright, how to correct the problem.  </s>
<s> you can contact them via email, if you don't seem to get a direct hit: i have this psc 1350 and it hasn't gone this route.  </s>
<s> you can try an uninstall and re-install if all this fails, but do that as a last resort.  </s>
<s> i would also suggest you do a registry clean(got a cleaner) before you re-install plus a reboot after the psc 1350 uninstalled then physically disconnect, then follow the proper install procedure.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i did go thru the alignment process a couple of times--the first time when i changed the cartriges, and then at least once more when i rebooted or whatever and got the alignment message.  </s>
<s> i'll go thru the help topics, and try unplugging and reinstalling the cartriges.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
