<s> i bought a seagate 40gb hard disk.when  </s>
<s> i installed in my computer and later started to create partitions of 2 drives of 20gb each but it said that i have maximum availability of 5%.please assist me what could be the problem in the hard disk?  </s>
<s> first, is this going to be a master/boot drive or is it going to be a slave to one that already exists?  </s>
<s> what disk are you using to create the partitions?  </s>
<s> one that came with the harddrive from seagate or a windows bootdisk?  </s>
<s> what version windows is the bootdisk for and does it match with what you plan to install on the drive or already is installed on another drive?  </s>
<s> if you are using this drive as a slave, are you accidently working with the boot drive and don't realize it?  </s>
<s> toni  </s>
<s> it is the masterboot drive and i tried to create the partitions using windows bootable floppy disk which i created from win 98.  </s>
