<s> hi. i've a sony dru-530a dvd burner(with recently upgrade firmware 2.1c) on a dell dimension 4550.  </s>
<s> i've 640 in ram and the processor runs at 2.53mghz.  </s>
<s> well, the problem is that i've ripped some dvd movies, and then copied then on dvd -r media, i've tried(memorex, tdk and verbatim), and when i finish, they all play well on the computer dvd, but when i put them on my sony dvd player in the living room, i get some still screens and some skips.  </s>
<s> all of them are like that, and i've tried in different dvd player that support the dvd -r/+r and so forth.  </s>
<s> i've use cyberlink dvdcopy, dvd shrink, nero burning room.  </s>
<s> i've burn at different speeds also, and i got the same problem.  </s>
<s> i've disable any background program while burning, and leave the computer alone to do its job, but it is the same.  </s>
<s> i go see the movie, it plays really well, but then some scenes in the movie get still for seconds or skip.  </s>
<s> i would love help, since i don't know what to do.  </s>
<s> i just feel like throwing my dvd burner to the garbage.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>

<s> &quot; i had this apex dvd player that i gave away.  </s>
<s> why? it did that on dvd+r and dvd-r from any machine/drive.  </s>
<s> you need to try another dvd player.  </s>
<s> in closing, i am thinking the 4x media should be burned at 2x, 8x at 4x and so on.  </s>
<s> just a nagging feeling it works better.  </s>
<s> no websites to back me up, just me.  </s>

<s> you can try dvdxcopy platinum pre banned edition along with maxell dvd-r disc which is what i always use.  </s>
<s> if you need more information or reviews on burners or media, you might try video help.com.  </s>
<s> thanks for the information and the advice.  </s>

<s> i have been using dvdcopy express (no longer supported) and used to get great burns.  </s>
<s> i've since re-formatted and may have deleted some files(???); the fact is i'm having the same problem.  </s>
<s> don't even &quot;see a disc&quot; message.  </s>
<s> but plays well in the original burniong pc. i am going to try another burner perhaps.  </s>
<s> please let me know if you have a solution.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> your post told nothing about the pc. it strains owners that reformat since microsoft will not fetch or install motherboard drivers for you.  </s>
<s> i'd comment further but you ignored the forum tip.  </s>
