check your powersupply.
...how do you know this?
explain your problem further. crashed, as in a dead cpu period, you did try it in another system? remove cpu then turn on system, what is the result? do you get any reaction? tada -----willy
my motherboard won't recognize the amd xp2900 processor. i have tried to reset the bios to the recommended 200 mhz x 10x multiplier. when the system tries to reboot it just hangs. i have to shut down and clear the cmos just to get it to the bios screen to start again. suggestions? the manual says this processor should work with this motherboard.
