(first character is cut off by edge of the screen, even if i move it to the right). i press f1, and it says detecting master and slave ide disks which works fine, then cmos checksum bad cmos time/data not set, press f1 to enter setup. i do this and set the time and data and everything, save changes and exit, then it reboots and wont come up with bios unless i reset it again. any ideas how to solve this problem? i need to sort this out fairly quickly. i have not done any bios updates.
