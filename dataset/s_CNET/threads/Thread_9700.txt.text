well it's that time again. five year old gateway needs to be replaced. thought i start here for suggestions on brand. i'm not a power user by any means, but want nice graphics, good speed, but reliability and support are the top priorities. appreciate your help. joe
price range? quality support will be hard to find since its mostly oversees now, but as long as i stay polite ive had good luck with dell
price is secondary to reliability. had one problem with gateway in the five years and that was the monitor. it went within the three year warranty and they replaced it under their warranty. no hassle.
