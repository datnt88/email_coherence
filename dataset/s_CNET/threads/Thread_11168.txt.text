is for these drives to age so fast. did you try a new dvdrw drive?
are these discs of the same region coding? likewise, are all your previous of the same or different? just to ask additional, for which, sometimes, even 3year old dvd player can still play, but some didn't realised the region coding of their disc, and thus, made the switched of 5 times, ending up with a permanent last region.
