<s> hey guys, i really need help on choosing the right gaming pc in time for christmas-ish.  </s>
<s> this will be the first gaming pc though i am a devout gamer, consoles mainly until my friend introduced me to the world of pc gaming so this is the first time i have ever bought one so be gentle with me.  </s>
<s> i'm looking around for a good pc that runs the latest games and is going to be future proof for a number of years.  </s>
<s> i have a budget of around &#163;1000 though i may be able to go up and down a little bearing in mind that i have got to buy a monitor and keyboard etc (using a laptop at the moment).  </s>
<s> i have been snooping around and the amount of choices are insane.  </s>
<s> so essentially what i would really like is advice on graphics cards, processors and the likes and what i could get for most bang for my buck.  </s>
<s> recommendations are welcome whether it be desktops or sites but i have no intention of building my own i'm afraid.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> any dual core cpu is about all we need.  </s>
<s> 4 or more gb ram and then the all important video card.  </s>
<s> i have a list i really like.  </s>
<s> here it is -&gt; frankly any card above the 101 usd line is going to rock compared to most off the shelf desktops.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> why go with a dual core, when you can get an i3 quad core for another hundred dollars or so.  </s>
<s> a dual core may work just fine, but the op was requesting a machine that wouldn't be horribly outdated for a couple years or so.  </s>
<s> my advice would be to look for an intel i5 quad core.  </s>
<s> you will notice a difference in performance between the two.  </s>
<s> do you have some online shopping sites in the uk that you would consider buying a pre-built pc from?  </s>
<s> do share them here and we'll be happy to help you pick the right system for your gaming needs.  </s>
<s> sorry about late reply haven't had the time to check emails properly in ages.  </s>
<s> err i was looking at overclockers.co.uk i don't really know any others.  </s>
