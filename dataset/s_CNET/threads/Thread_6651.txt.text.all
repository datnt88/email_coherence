i am looking at buying a new monitor and am wondering whether to get a crt or lcd monitor. 
which is more reliable, recommeneded, or is likely to last the longest? 
is a professors view on the issue contains great information is a discussion on the subject is just an advice all of this comes from a google search for crt versus lcd or crt versus lcd -tv to exclude information on tv's. 
happy reading!
