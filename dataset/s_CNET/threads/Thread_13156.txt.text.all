<s> my cd-rom drive appears to turn off and on while playing games which causes periodic freezes in the games that i play. is there anything that i can do to stop this from occuring as much?  </s>
<s> ...of smooth gameplay.  </s>
<s> cd roms spinning up causes a few seconds of lurching about (and the odd sound of a jet taking off inside your pc!), as your software waits on some data coming off the disc.  </s>
<s> with a modern high speed cd-rom drive there's nothing you can do about it (whisper) except...switch audio things like game music to &quot;off&quot;.  </s>
<s> alterantively if you've got a lot of hard drive space, when you install a game use the largest install type, to cut down on the amount of data having to come off the cd. the delay is caused by the drive slowing down to prevent wear and tear (who'd want that thing whining away for hours? it generates a rediculous amount of heat after 15 minutes at 52x speed too!), but the knock on effect is it has to spin up to full speed when data is finally required.  </s>
<s> it's a limitation of the hardware.  </s>
<s> as drive speeds have increased the spin up times have gotten progressively longer.  </s>
<s> geebee.  </s>
<s> alot of games can be installed with virtual cd rom software.  </s>
<s> its cheap.  </s>
<s> if your game is compatible with it it loads all onto hard disk and cd is not required at all.  </s>
<s> some games that require cd authentication wont do this.  </s>
<s> but its worth a try.  </s>
