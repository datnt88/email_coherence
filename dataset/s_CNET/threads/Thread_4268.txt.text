hi: i have always used live essentials until recently. the reason was i could not download adobe flash on a windows 7 ie 9 64bit. the issue is still pending; so i switched to google and am satisfied. i am not sure if i can delete all live essentials or would this affect my operating system? sure could use help re this.
checking the list today, if you use any of those apps, you might want to let it stay. bob
needed this review. thks. will have to keep it, reh.
