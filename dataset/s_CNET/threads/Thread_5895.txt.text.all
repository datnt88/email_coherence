<s> we have a in home wireless network using a d-link di-624 router (wireless g). the signal into our game room is too low to run our xbox360 live.  </s>
<s> in that room, we have enough of a signal to make the internet connection but the signal is just too low to run the games.  </s>
<s> when we move the xbox up into the same room as the router, there's no problem.  </s>
<s> my first option is not to upgrade the router and have to reinstall new wireless cards in my 3 connected computers.  </s>
<s> however, i've read several poor reviews of signal boosters.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> raise the router above furniture level, relocate cordless phone, video sender etc away from computer or router.  </s>
<s> try changing channels -- the different frequencies they represent work better or worse in different environments.  </s>
<s> if you detect neighbouring wifi, move to a channel at least 5 stops away.  </s>
<s> seems to be a good candidate for power line adapters.  </s>
<s> a little pricey, but it's a good alternative if you absolutely don't want to run a wired connection to your xbox.  </s>
<s> netgear and dlink are a couple of manufacturers, but you may want to stick with dlink for compatibility.  </s>
