i have a compaq presario sr1000 and i am looking to upgrade the graphics card, but i have two questions about the one i am hoping to purchase. 1. will it be able to fit in/work on my computer? 2. will it be able to smoothly run games like cs:source and guild wars. i have already upgraded the ram so that isn't a problem. the graphics card is: nvidia geforce 8400 gs 256mb ddr2 hdtv/dvi (pci-express) a link to it:
that's not unique enough, maybe.  lists 5 different subtypes. they have a lot of documentation on their site, but i couldn't easily find if it has the pci-express that's needed for the card you asked about. can you find something about available slots in the documentation that came with the pc? kees
i know that the card in my pc currently is a pci-express one, would that suggest that it would fit? or is there more to it than that?
as for the games, can you post the system requirements for the video. google is generally a good way to find them. a 8400, or course, isn't the hottest or the latest. kees
