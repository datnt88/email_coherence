<s> i have a 2wire homeportal 1000sw and would like to get an inexpensive wireless card or usb connector that will work with this system.  </s>
<s> i have read elsewhere that you have to use a 2wire product, but i find it hard to believe that no one has developed a product to fill this demand (sbc/yahoo dsl has many customers).  </s>
<s> can anyone help with this? a 2wire adapter costs almost half as much as i spent to build my daughter's computer.  </s>
<s> thanks: blackflame  </s>
<s> notes it does 802.11b.  </s>
<s> that's a standard and the cheapest 802.11b pcmcia card i ever dredged up was 8 dollars.  </s>
<s> on average it's closer to 20 or 30.  </s>
<s> it's not proprietary (802.11b) so why not?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i use a geton from truckstop.net.  </s>
<s> bought it on ebay for $5.00.  </s>
<s> i work in a small office about 25ft from the portal and it just zips along.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
