am building amd64 computer and the mb supports sata drives. is a 7200 rpm sata any quicker at read/write than my 7200rpm ide? i have a 1 year old ide hd with 8 meg buffer that i am presently using. asus a8v mb
in short, it was the same speed in those benchmarks. the interface is not the issue. bob
thanks bob. again, you've helped make my computing decisions easier. ken
