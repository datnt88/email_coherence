<s> recently i bought a new cheap laptop because my previous one had some over-heating problem. the model of the new one is hp 255, some basic specs are like this: amd e2-2000 1.75g cpu integrated radeon hd 7340 graphic card 4g ddr3 1600 ram 500 g hdd hard disk.  </s>
<s> win8 os i never use the computer to play game or watch hd movies, so i thought even this cheap one (300 euros) can satisfy me.  </s>
<s> but after i got this, i noticed the performance is really really bad.  </s>
<s> there is even some freezing when i browse the web pages.  </s>
<s> flash video is not smooth either, crappier than my 3 years old laptop. the windows experience index is 3.9, which is again much lower than my previous laptop, a 3 years old thankpad t400 (4.8).  </s>
<s> so i am really frustrated and got confused why a model which was produced in the spring this year can be this bad.  </s>
<s> and the specs didn't even look too bad compared to some other 500 euros laptops then i re-checked the specs and noticed that the graphic card is integrated (didn't noticed that before).  </s>
<s> could it be the reason why the system is so slow?  </s>
<s> do you think increasing the ram, for example, to 8gb will help it?  </s>
<s> and like how much the improvement would be?  </s>
<s> like i mentioned, i don't use it to play games.  </s>
<s> i only need a laptop that i can browse web smoothly.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> i tried one of those systems and ended up giving it to my brother as an loaner in his office.  </s>
<s> it's really bad compared to better cpus.  </s>
<s> i'd get my money back and try again.  </s>

<s> ram upgrade isn't going to help, bob has the right idea, this processor isn't going to cut the mustard..  </s>
