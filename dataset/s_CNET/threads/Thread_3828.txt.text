i have a laptop running xp professional. my desktop is an imac with the latest version of the mac os. i have a dlink di524 router connected to the imac. i connect wirelessly with the laptop. i can print directly from the laptop to a epson stylus c88 when i plug it directly into the laptop. is it possible to print wirelessly from my laptop? i do have sharing turned on in the printer preferences on the imac. thanks for any assistance. in the unlikely event that it helps i also have parallel software running on the imac. jon
in our mac os forum too.
thanks, will do.
did you ever get an answer to this? i cannot figure this out. i am print from my macbook pro via my imac no problem. but as for my dell... it doesn't even recognize the imac as existing on the network, let alone be able to print via the imac. any solutions?
