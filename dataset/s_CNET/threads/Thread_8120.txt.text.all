<s> i went to newegg and it seems all the rdram is way more expensive than all the other kinds.  </s>
<s> why is that?  </s>
<s> it's most expensive because it's not widely produced and was expensive to begin with.  </s>
<s> as only a few chipsets support it and it's actually lesser in performance than ddr pc 1600 in dual channel it's a rather old technology (think 2000-2001)  </s>
<s> supposed to be the wave of the future but, just like vhs and beta vcr's that changed.  </s>
<s> so, rambus isn't widely produced and is more expensive because of it.  </s>
