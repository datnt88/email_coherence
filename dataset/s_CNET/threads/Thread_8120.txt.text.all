i went to newegg and it seems all the rdram is way more expensive than all the other kinds. 
why is that? 
it's most expensive because it's not widely produced and was expensive to begin with. 
as only a few chipsets support it and it's actually lesser in performance than ddr pc 1600 in dual channel it's a rather old technology (think 2000-2001) 
supposed to be the wave of the future but, just like vhs and beta vcr's that changed. 
so, rambus isn't widely produced and is more expensive because of it.
