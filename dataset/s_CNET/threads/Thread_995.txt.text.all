<s> do you reccomend leaving the power button on all the time?  </s>
<s> power setting -turn off monitor: 15 minutes -turn off hard discs: 30 minutes -sytem standby: 1 hour -system hibernate: never  </s>
<s> the choice to turn off, or leave on a computer system, and the arguments thereabout form one of the ongoing religious wars in the computer world.  </s>
<s> you will hear both opinions expressed vehemently, fervently, acerbically, and loudly.  </s>
<s> as a computer maintenacne technician for the last 34 years, my suggestion is to pick a religion, and abide by it.  </s>
<s> i have walked in on systems that have been powered on continuously for 8 years without problems (no, not even the disks!). however, when you power down one of these always-on puppies, you say a lot of prayers when you power it back on. the power up cycle includes &quot;inrush&quot; current that can blow a weak component, and has on many occassions.  </s>
<s> of course, now you broke my machine! is the first thing you hear.  </s>
<s> on the other hand, fans and disks in particular wear out over time, they can't help it, they're mechanical, and they spin on bearings.  </s>
<s> turning them off of course stops the wear, so instead of lasting the &quot;statutory&quot; 5 years, they may well function for 15 years of intermittent use.  </s>
<s> anything in the machine that is going to die after 2 years of power-on time, may last 6-7 years of intermittent use.  </s>
<s> so both sides see that they are right, and they always will.  </s>
<s> pick a side, and join the fun.  </s>
<s> like me.  </s>
<s> i basically turn the computer on when i get home from school at 3:00. then since i am on and off the whole night, i just leave it on.  </s>
<s> then when i go to bed, i turn it off.  </s>
<s> thats just my opinion.  </s>
<s> the emachine has trouble starting up, so it goes into standby some hours a day.  </s>
<s> it stays on the others to cut on power.  </s>
<s> i tryed the power settings,turn momitor off 15min, turn hard discs off: 30 min.  </s>
<s> i then tryed leaving it on all the time with screen saver on.  </s>
<s> my wife & i went to town one day & when we came in we smelled something was burning.  </s>
<s> we found that one of case fans was smoking.  </s>
<s> we were lucky only had to replace the fan & every thing was ok .  </s>
<s> i allways turn the cup;s off at night or when we are gone.  </s>
<s> good luck to you.  </s>
<s> gordon  </s>
<s> its now set to do standby every 5 hours.  </s>
<s> that way it starts up properly is that fine?  </s>
<s> it for years, no problems, but read about it here...and good luck reading all the 520 posts...lol.  </s>
