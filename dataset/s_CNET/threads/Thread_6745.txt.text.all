<s> i have the hsc on its artic silver 5 i did the pea size amount and i clipped the fan correctly onto the cpu its a flush agaimst the cpu as i can humanly tell  </s>
<s> after reading your post i have come to the conclusion maybe the system doesn't have enough juice pumping in; in other words more watts.  </s>
<s> i could be wrong but if starting the computer and then shutting down like that it sound like you make need to buy a power supply with more watts. the other thing that i noticed was that the temp.  </s>
<s> was high but according to you, the right amount of thermal paste was applied and the fan was installed correctly, if all that was correct consider this the system needs power like you need food to make atp for ur cells' activities, but anyways consider more wattts.  </s>
<s> and also maybe something was damaged by static shock just something to think about.  </s>
<s> if the temp was really 240 your cpu would be fried.  </s>
<s> i hope you meant a pea sized dot of paste instead of an amount of paste the size of a pea.  </s>
<s> once you spread it out it should be thin enough that none squirts out the side when you mount the heatsink.  </s>
<s> did you visually verify that the cpu fan was spinning?  </s>
<s> personally i would be very suspicious of the power supply.  </s>
<s> i would not go for more watts i would use a better company.  </s>
<s> seasonic, fortran, silverstone, antec, enermax all make pretty good power supplies.  </s>
<s> i had my mobo replaced just incase and i've put everything back together and its still doing what it was...i switched out the psu with an older one again and it did the same thing with the new psu everything on the comp runs everything and it shuts off right at the bios page what more can i do my pc is on for 2-5 sec so how can it be a cpu heat problem...  </s>
