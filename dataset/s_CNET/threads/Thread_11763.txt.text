hello, i realize my question is going to be a bit vague, but i have a computer, windows xp sp3, that has a main hd (c:) and a storage drive (g:). there's nothing on the storage drive other than misc. stuff like pictures taken, pdf files, work stuff etc. (no installed software). if i were to remove this, can i just as easily reinsert it and have it work as before or do i need to do something special to ensure the g: drive is read again?
but some do this and lose access to the drive contents. i'll skip all the scenarios why this happens but sure, if you have a backup copy of what you can't lose, you're ready. bob
possibly a big but... we don't know what your computer is. for example mine is a &quot;tools free&quot; desktop tower from alienware. tools free means all i have to do is shutdown, disconnect the power, remove the side panel, discharge myself of static, then unclip a couple of connections and pull the drive tray out. what makes it easier is that the drives are all sata conventional and no ssds to confuse the issue. what computer is yours? mark
hello and thanks for the help. it's your run-of-the-mill e-machine desktop. nothing too fancy and removing would only require what you described mark. i believe the hds are sata.
those go missing all the time. be sure you have what you can't lose on backups. bob
