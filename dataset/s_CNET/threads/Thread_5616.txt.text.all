<s> hi webman.have  </s>
<s> you given thought to the core i7 cpu? the core i7 920 cpu, can be had for under $3oo. the mobo will cost more though.  </s>
<s> the benefits outweigh the extra cost by the way of future proofing (at least a little longer) your pc. clock speed isn`t everything.  </s>
<s> with the i7 there are less chances of bandwith bottlenecks; shorter memory path which does not need to go through the northbridge first.  </s>
<s> overclocking is easier as well.  </s>
<s> 4ghz is achieved regularly.  </s>
<s> anyways, just a thought.  </s>
<s> i would up the psu.  </s>
<s> to at least 700w. the 450w will run everything but it will run at the limit.  </s>
<s> you need some headroom so the psu is never stressed and possibly fry your pc. do not scimp on power.  </s>
<s> i run 900w on mine.  </s>
<s> have fun building!  </s>
<s> ok, so i'd have to get a different mobo to run the other processor?  </s>
<s> and i was planning on running xp. and how hard is it to over clock?  </s>
<s> i know what it is, but i've never done it.  </s>
