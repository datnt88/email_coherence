what will be the best wireless router today for wired speed? the wireless part is not that important, just to be there. any ones experience will be helpful. thanks
however the old method of setup still wins. here it is! cable/dsl/fiber modem -&gt; router -&gt; gigabit switch. no, i will not be supplying any make or models here as there is no full percent gain from one to the next with this setup. bob
i agree on the setup. are all the units the same? my set up is now a motorola modem from a cable company and a cisco 800 gateway. now i would like to find a router under $200 that will give the best and reliable results on today new technology, under that price. i realize there are better quality unit at a higher price. i need to replace my old linksys router. do you or any one else can share their results with their router?
are all the units the same? - of course not. but for your first question in your original post the differences are less than 1% so i'll stop writing here. do you or any one else can share their results with their router? - unlikely. if you would publish some web site with &quot;can you do this benchmark for me and share the make, models and (all) your settings?&quot; then maybe you'll get a load of data but for the setup i shared we are still in the sub percent difference when we copy files to/from machines, change the switch and re-test. this is why i don't bother sharing make and models. these are fungigle. bob
try this d-link dir-655 xtreme n gigabit router.
i was thinking of ordering d-link dr-655, but after many post numerous searches and the recommendation of a few, yesterday i ordered the linksys wrt320n. i hope i made the right choice. i will keep posting. i will receive it by the weekend. thanks to all.
