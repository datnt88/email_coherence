<s> my computer has a amd athlon processor with 802 mhz and 256 mb ram, running windows me. the power supply is from skyhawk, but i'm not sure what wattage it is.  </s>
<s> first the computer started being slow to shut down, then it would start turning itself on by itself.  </s>
<s> one day it kept turning on and my husband kept shutting it down.  </s>
<s> when i got home, it wouldn't turn on, so i checked all connections, dusted it out and then hooked it back up and turned it on.  </s>
<s> smoke came out of the power supply vents, so shut it back down.  </s>
<s> i am sure it's the power supply, but don't know where to find the wattage, and what size power supply to replace it with.  </s>
<s> hopefully this is enough info.  </s>
<s> thanks for your help  </s>
<s> get at least a 350 w.  </s>
<s> would a power supply with a dual fan be better to use?i  </s>
<s> really don't want this to happen again.needing to know how large a power supply is safe for this computer.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> your basic pc can use any oversized power supply since it will only draw the power it needs.  </s>
<s> supersizing the supply to 450 watts is a 20 dollar exercise and has no downside.  </s>
<s> compgeeks.com  </s>
<s> has these all the time, so shop around.  </s>
<s> dual fans are nice.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you probably had a 250w or 300w p/s unit. the good news is a larger p/s will fit, so a 350w or larger of the same pysical type will work even if it isn't the exact same wattage as you're old one.  </s>
<s> check this website for some info, then shop: or any similar p/s maker... good luck ----willy  </s>
