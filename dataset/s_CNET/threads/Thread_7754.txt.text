well having just replaced a chipset cooling fan, i wonder if there have been enough hours (2 years daily use) that i should replace the cpu fan, or does one just wait til one hears noise? --fj
sleeve bearing units seem to last about year here. i had this old dual pentium pro that is now some 10 years old and it has intel's supplied ball bearing fans and it's just fine with no sign i'll replace those. my answer is 'from one year to never.' bob
a really dusty pc with heavy buildup on the blades will shorten the fan's life.
unlike any other fan you may encounter and in a small form, they do a good job even if cheaply made. for the most part having gotten 2yrs. out of one is pretty good. i clean and &quot;re-oil&quot; if applicable as some have a top lock that gets loose or simply wears out and thus the bearing don't maintain well. these are cheap fans and those that are maganetically driven are more apt to cope. all, in all, these fans work best when cleaned(blowout) and brushed off. uneven wieght can destory a good fan. for the cost of replacement, just keep an eye on them. of course quality matters. if you can, mount a larger fan with adapter for better coling and fan upkeep. the larger the fan, the slower it has to rpm for keep the same level of cooling. tada -----willy
