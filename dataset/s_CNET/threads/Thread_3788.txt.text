i have an old motherboard that is used in a digital video recorder. the motherbaord is a 2003 bayfield, the memory chip is a 256mb sdram ddr dimm 184 pc133. i want to put a 1 gig chip in but not sure if the faster chips will work in the motherboard. i dont need the faster speed chip, but they are all that is available now and also much cheaper. do you think a pc2700 or something similar will work in a 2003 bayfield motherboard. i think all it takes is one memory chip. i haven't opened the case up yet because i need it recording my store. thanks!
pc133 should be 168 pin but you mentioned ddr 184 pc133. that 184 is a valid pin count so i'm not sure what you have but the mix isn't compatible. you'll need to open the case, i suspect. i can't find that board at crucial so maybe it has another name.
finds this board. the problem is that many chipsets didn't support such large memory sticks back then for simple reasons. i won't detail how the world has changed but i find some that find it incredible that a machine today doesn't support today's sticks and drives. but it is so. moving on.  might be this board.  does list a 1gb stick so all that you can do is try it and hope the stick's organization is fine. this is not to offer a course in memory tech but to write i find the speed to not be the problem here but the organization. bob
