i have an external harddrive that i use to back up my pc, but i am running out of room to store files (lots of graphics). i don't really want to save my graphics files to cd because i like to have easy access to them. should i purchase another internal or external harddrive, and if so, how would i then backup the files stored on these? i'm a newbie to hardware issues, so i appreciate any help you may offer. thank you very much!
your external hard disk is not a backup. you can find posts in these forums where externals have &quot;lost it all&quot; along with their &quot;backups&quot; on said external. where is the real backup of what you can't lose? bob
i thought i could use my external harddrive to backup my files. this is what i was told when i purchased it. this isn't true? if not, then what is the easiest way to backup my files? thank you for your help.
1. a few posts in these forums of failures.    2. i find a dvd writer to be nice. 4 gigabytes on a dvdrw and just a few hold what i can't lose. i have 3 copies. bob
is there a dvd writer you would recommend?
at the office we use generic names like teac, liteon, sony, lg and more. we pay from 39 to 99 bucks for the drives and use software such as cdburnerxp or other titles. it all works and if we do lose a drive (rare, but happens) we replace it and move on. some want to analyze the makes, models until they find the best solution. we can't do that so we buy it, install it and start using it. hope this helps. bob
thank you very much for your help. i guess i'm off to buy a dvd writer! cindy
