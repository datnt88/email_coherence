i use an intel mac mini. roxio toast 8 will recognise the external sony drive, but will not recognise any of the dvd blank media i use, be it dvd-r or dvd+r. why is this ?
- what do you mean with &quot;recognize&quot;? - can you read existing dvd's, in other words: are it only blank media that give trouble? kees
dvd media when used with your intel mac? i'm with kees on this, does it play regular, commercial, dvd's and cd&quot;s p
... the laser failed to calibrate or some such thing (i never saved it to dig deeper). i just pop in another blank disc until i find one will burn. i usually end up with 1 disc out of 6 that won't burn. this is using disc utility to burn disc images on an external sony dvd burner drx-820. i also use popcorn and/or toast 6 lite (which came with the burner) but don't recall problems with those programs. cheers grim
they only last a year or two. at least a new drive is cheap. try the usual cd/dvd lens cleaner then a new drive in that housing. bob
i was not aware of such a short life span for dvd burner drives. i have a cd burner which has lasted 5 years without a hiccup. is that aby-normal or is it just a common difference between the two types of technology? thanks for the tip about the drive showing wear and tear bob. grim
the shortest time i ran into was 6 months. it was an &quot;easy&quot; as to why it died so soon. the case they selected had no vents and no fans. it cooked. bob
figured out toast must be at fault. i tried burning using the operating systems facility, by using the disc image on the desktop of the blank media, dropping stuff onto it and burning, all fine !
