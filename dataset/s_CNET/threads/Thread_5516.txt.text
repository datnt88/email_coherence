hello! i recently bought a toshiba libretto 100ct operating on windows 98se, and included with it was an external floppy drive (pcmcia connecter). after i plug it in and try and open up a floppy from [my computer; drive a:], it says &quot;a:/ is not accessible, the device is not ready&quot;. now, after a little research i found out that there is no driver installed so the only way to get files off the floppy is to do a file copy from ms-dos mode. it tells me to switch in msdos mode to a: , but when i do this it cannot read drive a: ... for this reason, i do not believe that this external floppy drive is considered as drive a: , but do not know what a pcmcia card command is and how to move files from the floppy to the computer itself. thanks
some more additional info... if i go into system then hardware profiles, it says something to the extent of &quot;drive a is using ms-dos compatibility mode file system&quot;, but won't let me open drive a: in ms-dos mode. this is why i think that an external fdd (pcmcia) is not considered as a drive.
you've shot past the decade mark on the hardware so are firmly into &quot;computer pre-history.&quot; your best bet is to ask the former owner for some tips as well as use google.com bob
