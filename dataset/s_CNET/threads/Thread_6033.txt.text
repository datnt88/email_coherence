this is the fix for the amd dual-core gt5032 computer tv and fm locking up. this link will take you to amd for the patch.  this patch will fix everything. take care missionbbs web page
bought this computer and liked it right away, but tv skipped, locked up, etc. almost immediately. fortunately, found this website. first found and downloaded &quot;the wesker&quot; microsoft update, which worked great until right after i posted my thanks online here to him last night. so, searched and some more and found your amd update. also downloaded and installed it, ran the tv overnight and continuing today, and have not had any more glitches. so, not sure if the amd download would work alone, or need the combo of ms & amd, and not sure why ms download alone failed after a couple of hours. i have also read since that there is an nvidia update that may also help in bettering performance of tv tuner, but not sure what and where that download is...thanks again for the link. i will most likely keep this computer now, if all keeps going well.
i am glad i could help you with the link. i love this computer also. don't forget you can hear everything in surround sound on this computer. if you need help on this let me know. missionbbs
i guess i was unaware of the surround sound feature, and would appreciate any information you can provide...thanks again.
