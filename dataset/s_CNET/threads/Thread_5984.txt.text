music will be located in the (your name) document folder. locate the sub-folder called /my music/itunes. copy the /itunes folder to the new drive. after you're restored, after you reinstall itunes, copy the itunes folder back to the exact spot. wayne click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. 5 db hot.
thanks alot for making this so easy for me.
