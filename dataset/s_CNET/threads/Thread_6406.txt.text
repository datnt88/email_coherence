i just bought a hard drive which was shipped to me. living in the upper midwest, the weather has been 20 deg farenheight during the days that the hard drive was in transit. when i checked the manufacturer web site regarding maintaining the drive properly, they say not to keep the drive below 40 degrees. 1)have i put the hard drive at risk by shipping it in this extrememely cold weather which contradicts the manufacturer recomended temperature? 2)can shipping an item like a hard drive in a small box as it was shipped from the retailer, jeapardize the inegrity of it?
then you avoid the usual damage. sorry but this will be my only reply as i find folk fret a lot about this and i can't repeat long discussions about why moisture is bad. bob
being shipped in cold temps shouldn't be a problem as long as you give it a couple of hours to get to normal room temperature before trying to use it. when not in use, the read/write heads will be docked away from the platters to keep from having problems. i've seen folks ruin hard drives by trying to operate them when they're too cold though. the platters in the disk drives are made with a metallic base which expands and contracts with temp changes, so you do need to be careful not to operate them when they're outside of the manufacturer's specifications. good luck.
