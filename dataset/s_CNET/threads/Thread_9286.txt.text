hello, i have a d-link di-514 wireless router and i've been using it from past one year, i connect my laptop and mobile through wifi with my pc(windows xp), it has been working fine till now, all of a sudden fron last night my laptop and mobile are unable to detect the wifi signals(provided, internet on pc is working fine), i tried all possible trouble shooting steps but, none worked for me....can you please suggest me what possibly might have gone wrong, and what am i supposed to do, to make my wifi router working again. thanks in advance.
turn the wifi off and on in the router. now be sure the security is set to wpa and you broadcast a single ssid. i've found that helps if it's the usual issue. if not, try another router.
i tried selecting all types of securities(wep,wpa,..) available in the drop down, but none worked. how can i check, if my wifi is working or not ? can u please suggest me....
the next test requires another router.
turn the wireless off, then on? are you broadcasting ssid? try power cycling the router. turn it off for 30 seconds, then back on. if no joy, it's time for a new router.
