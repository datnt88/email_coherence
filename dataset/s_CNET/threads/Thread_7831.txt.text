don't assume anything, know what you have with 100% certainly. then visit the acer support website and see if anything is offered as an &quot;upgrade&quot; option. two areas that can benefit immediately are ram and video. understand how your ram is set-up and add more. then proceed to better video and here for gaming that's where alot falls on a good video card. however, once a power hungry card is installed you need the psu that's &quot;very capable&quot; to support it and whatever else gets added. also, cooling is very important so add more cooling if possible and/or upgrade to more fans or liquid cooling. since, is to be a gaming rig, cooling will play an important part, so don't dismiss this until later. heat and wattage use will increase temps and start to degrade the overall components over time, do this asap. last, quality does matter, buy the good stuff. tada ------willy
the 3200 video is the bottleneck. what you the about 100 buck gpu from this list to spice it up?  bob
