first all i see is a strange noise coming out of my pc, then lately windows wont startup, i tried the startup disk and tried to access drive c: all it says is abort/retry/fail... is this the end of my drive? thanks
however, it could be a virus but probably isnt because u mentioned &quot;a strange noise&quot; and &quot;access drive c: abort/retry/fail&quot; hope u saved any important files u had
the makers of most hard disks offer a drive fitness test on their web sites. i've used that to make the call. bob
thanksss
thats the thing, my windows wont start so i cant do any harddrive testing... anyway, how much does a decent new harddrive cost these days? im not talking about the gazillion gigabyte ones, just the ordinary, everyday use, hdd.... thanksssssssssssssssss
did you even try the hd maker's test pgms? you should, that will answer your question, plus if you have any warranty, they will require to run it and report back. these pgms. usually are independant of windoze being present, they boot on thier own via floppy. if you want to skip all that, then simply buy a new hd. google or visit your favorite online vendor or check local shops/stores for sales or not. a 60gb is roughly $65, maybe less if some rebate is involved and of course a sale. pricing is dirt cheap when compared to 2 yrs. ago, you can get a large gb hd provided your system can support it. happy usa -----willy
ivve seen a 80gb western digital go for around 40 bucks a couple times
