<s> hello everyone.  </s>

<s> i am desperate for help.  </s>
<s> i have a dell desktop and dell xps 1530 laptop, and dsl service through at&t.  </s>
<s> i recently purchased a linksys wrt310n router and could not get it running with help from all 3 customer service reps. it was determined that the router was bad and i returned it in exchange for a linksys wrt160n.  </s>

<s> make sure your computer is directly connected to the router step 1: shutdown the computer.  </s>
<s> step 2: reset the router while power on then unplug the routers power cable.  </s>
<s> step 3: unplug the broadband modems power cable and wait for 30 seconds.  </s>
<s> step 4: plug in the broadband modems power cable and wait for its lights to appear stable.  </s>
<s> step 5: plug in the router's power cable once the modems lights appear stable.  </s>
<s> step 6: power on the computer on and check internet connection.  </s>
<s> if you still have no internet connection, access the router setup page and configure the router settings; change the router lan ip address to 192.168.2.1, set the connection type to pppoe and manually type yoour att username (in email format) and password, save settings.  </s>
<s> go to the router setup page and click on the connect button step 7: test the internet connection once the status indicates connected and ip address show up if this still didnot work, upgrade the firmware of your router and repeat the same steps.  </s>
<s> note: configuring the router settings will depends who is your provider.  </s>
<s> if your isp is dsl you need to configure your isp username (email address format) and password on the router.  </s>
<s> if your router is a cable no need to change any settings on the router.  </s>
<s> it should automatically work  </s>
<s> then click start, run or hit the windows key and the r key at the same time.  </s>
<s> this will bring up run.  </s>
<s> type cmd hit enter type ipconfig /all (space between the g and /) hit enter look for the default gateway.  </s>
<s> put that number in the address bar.  </s>
<s> log into the linksys router.  </s>
<s> broadcast ssid use wpa-psk(tkip) security mixed b and g mode(n if available) use channels 1, 6 or 11. most wireless devices work best on these channels.  </s>
