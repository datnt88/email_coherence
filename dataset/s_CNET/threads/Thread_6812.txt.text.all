<s> next i attached a linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back.  </s>
<s> then i hooked the 624 to the linsky router.  </s>
<s> now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet.  </s>
<s> i tried to go into the installtion url, but the operation &quot;times out&quot; every time.  </s>

<s> &quot;the thing wouldn't let connect to internet on the host computer!  </s>
<s> but the connection was on.  </s>
<s> on the wireless computer i got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet.' a confusing statement, clarification is needed.  </s>
<s> how many computers are on this lan and how do they connect.  </s>
<s> &quot;next i attached a linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back.  </s>
<s> then i hooked the 624 to the linsky router.  </s>

<s> this is where it gets muddy when you put two routers together.  </s>
<s> simplify this network down to one router and give d-link tech support a call.  </s>
<s> i have one of these devices.  </s>
<s> after i bought it i went through the same thing you are going through.  </s>
<s> i could not get it to connect wirelessly (even with all of the up dates) or wired to other dlink devices.  </s>
<s> i finally ended up giving it away to a friend that owns a coffee house for use as an internet access point for customers.  </s>
<s> he has to reboot it about 6 times a day to even get it to work as an access point (not even as a router).  </s>
<s> if you can return it your should return as soon as possible and replace it the belkin 125 unit.  </s>
<s> i worked with the di624 for about 2 months and it never worked right.  </s>
<s> i've got 3 belkin wireless units and have not had any trouble with them.  </s>
<s> one of them (802.11b) has been running now without reboot for about 18 months.  </s>
<s> they are easy to set up and they work.  </s>
