buying a new mid-range desktop later this week. haven't decided on whether to buy one off gateway's web site, velocity micro's site, or just go to best buy and make the purchase. i chose gateway and velocity for there customer service and quality of systems. most reviews on them seem to be good. i know you can customize if you buy from thier web sites, but that is the only advantage i see so far. gateway, velocity, or best buy store? your opinions please.
after many looksee's i wonder if they have nothing but older models or units they bought a boatload of. if you go that route, get the make/model and go back home to research that model and see if it's been superseded or you can beat it by going direct. bob
the retail versions of gateways are technically not as good as those offered direct from gateway. the retail pcs use more low-end components (lower rated power supplies, ddr2-533 vs ddr2-667 ram, i945 instead of i965 chipset, etc.) but the prices of the retail units are hard-to-beat: $749 for a core2duo, 2gb ram, and 320gb hd.
i ordered one from vm last week after doing much research. i had originally ordered one to be customized from hp. i also ordered a monitor from them. i got the monitor (actually 2), and since both were defective, i cancelled my order after spending about 4 hours on the phone with their &quot;tech support&quot;. arrgh! i think the deciding factor for buying a vm was this article. i thought it was very helpful:  good luck!
