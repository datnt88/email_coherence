<s> my thumb drive out of no where can't be read by any system, from pc to laptop.  </s>
<s> all my hard work lost, is there any possible way to get my data back.  </s>
<s> when my thumb drive can't be detach at all?  </s>
<s> a thumb drive is a nice way to transport data between pc's and also as a medium for backup (siince it's only one of your backup media it's not a problem if the data on it is lost then).  </s>
<s> but it definitely is a bad place to store your only copy of data, especially if it contains the result of 'hard work'.  </s>
<s> although it's better than an external hard disk, your experience proves that it isn't fail-safe.  </s>
<s> nothing is fail-safe, by the way.  </s>
<s> if your work is worth more than, say, usd 1000, you can consider to contact drivesavers.com  </s>
<s> or some other trusted data recovery company.  </s>

<s> while i always put it under a microscope i'm encountering a lot of folk that demand details beyond what can be written here.  </s>

<s> but nobody that doesn't do this today should attempt this when this is the last copy.  </s>
<s> for the uninitiated you tell them to contact drivesavers and repeat these are great ways to transport but never a place for the last copy.  </s>

<s> any errors or some display of why it can't do what it did before.  </s>
<s> google for rescue/recovery s/w and check the results.  </s>
<s> however, if it can't even see that a device is really there, you're hosed.  </s>
<s> always have multiple sources stored of your precious data, now you know why.  </s>
<s> adios -----willy  </s>
<s> files are accessible.  </s>
<s> i don't know why this works, but sometimes it does.  </s>
<s> keep the chill times short, no more than 20 minutes, and check.  </s>
<s> if no, then set it aside for an hour or so and try again.  </s>
<s> don't give up.  </s>
<s> i managed to get data back after 6 weeks of multiple tries.  </s>
<s> a drive like this may become usable after a period of time of non-use, but that's not a certain thing.  </s>
