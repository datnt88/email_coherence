<s> hello, i do graphic/web design, and wondered if there was a specific gateway laptop that works best for this purpose.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> i would say the gateway m520 only because it has a p4 for your purposes.  </s>
<s> but maybe a centrino might work?  </s>
<s> idk.  </s>
<s> anyone out there?  </s>
<s> the pentium m(centrino can be celeron m or pentium m, go for the latter) has been known to outperform the pentium 4 in performance, battery life, and heat. the 600 series of p4 can heat the surface to 140f.  </s>
<s> ouch.  </s>
<s> however, have you looked at other brands as well?  </s>
<s> i tend to go toward amd processors because they are faster for a lower price.  </s>
<s> pentium m = greatness even outperforming pentium 4s in games.  </s>
<s> ddr2 = slight performance gain over ddr nvidia 6600go = while not as powerful as a 6800go, this gpu will still tackle anything you throw at it asus z71v = one of the best barebook/notebook on the market today.  </s>
<s> gamers prefer this notebook for its superb overclocking ability with both the cpu and the gpu.  </s>
<s> konny  </s>
<s> there are posts in these forums lamenting such decisions.  </s>
<s> backup your advice with where the support comes from as well as the spare parts issues in year 2 and 3... bob  </s>
