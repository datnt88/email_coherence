<s> good morning, currently working on two flavours of the toshiba nb525 and everytime i feel like i'm getting somewhere a wall pops up and smacks me flat on the ass.  </s>
<s> see, my current contract holder has decided (against all supported arguement) that netbooks are the future and wishes to replace desktops with them.  </s>
<s> in the next few months i am expected to have upwards of 400 of these little list.cnet.remains  </s>
<s> more_fragments more_threads pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> s.cnet.dev  </s>
<s> s.cnet.test  </s>
<s> s.cnet.train  </s>
<s> scripts threads rolled out.  </s>
<s> that being said, doing each one manually would be a pain in the rear and i've been working with our zenworks manager to get our imaging server compatible.  </s>
<s> well images can be made but there are still massive issues with imaging as these netbooks just dont seem to want to work the way i tell em to.  </s>
<s> anyways question is.. is anyone else doing netbooks through an imaging server?  </s>
<s> if so what os are you using?  </s>
<s> (we're trying to use windows7) what hints or tips can you give out?  </s>
<s> microsoft has courses and seminars on this. is the it staff unwilling or unable to take the courses on this?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i only hold the contract to work in the shop, the in-house technicians are reluctant to use microsoft anything(except as standard os') and while they have access to microsoft training, i do not and since i am on contract i will not be given any.  </s>
<s> to be honest, i feel like i've been placed in a box of bricks, because i am constantly relying on others work to further this effort and it is not a high priority to others but it is a major portion of my workload.  </s>
<s> i would love to take any courses offered but have neither the time (as this contract is paid hourly) or the money(as it would be out of personal pocket) so here i am, looking for any assistance.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> over the years i've taken time to go to quite a few.  </s>
<s> fast forward to today.  </s>
<s> once in awhile you find folk that think what you asked about can be written in one or two pages.  </s>
<s> or in this forum in less than a few paragraphs.  </s>
<s> sadly it's not that simple.  </s>
<s> if it was, there would be no need for the courses, books, seminars and investing our time learning our trade.  </s>
<s> if you must do this at zero cost, be sure to use google but add this -&gt; msdn.  </s>
<s> a lot of the course content is on msdn.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
