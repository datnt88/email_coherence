<s> i have bought office 2007 and downloaded it to my desk top, i have the back up disks and i want to put it onto my note book instead of having to buy another office suite.  </s>
<s> any ideas on how to do this since the note book doesnt have a dvd drawer?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> over the years i added an usb dvdrw drive to my collection.  </s>
<s> that's how i solved this.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ...on more than one computer (student/home edition allows installation on up to three machines), then download office from microsoft directly onto netbook and use license number from your purchased disks to register it.  </s>
<s> that's how i got it onto my netbook.  </s>
<s> i found that i was able to download my wife's office installation cd onto a 4gig jump drive from her desktop.  </s>
<s> i simply plugged the jump drive into her netbook and opened up the office installation software.  </s>
<s> of course, she has a legal version of office with the permission to use it on more than one of her computers.  </s>
<s> it all worked out just fine.  </s>
