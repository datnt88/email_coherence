not many of 4 gb flash drives seem to be rated and there are tons on ebay. i need one, preferably a usb 2.0, that will be dependable and fast. any experiences and/or recommendations? thanks
i've got the corsair voyager 4gb... it's fast, comes with a nice lanyard with metal clip, usb extension cable (nice for tight spaces with mulitple usb devices connected) and 10 year warranty. so far it's served me well. take a look at the linke below...lots to choose from.  the patriot extreme performance 4gb flash drive (usb2.0 portable) model pef4g200usb looks interesting too. fast, lifetime warranty, lanyard (hard to see what it looks like), no extension cable. let us know what you decide on and how you like it. vapcmd
you would find similar results in comparing regular gas for your car. outside of cosmetic appearances, write protect switch and maybe some bundled software there isn't much to compare here. i will write that i own a pair of 1g usb drives and they are nice to have about. by year end i'll see about getting a 4gb model but until then i picked up a 60gb small drive for same price as the 4gb flash unit. bob
