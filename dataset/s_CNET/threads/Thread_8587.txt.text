i have a leadtek winfast tv 2000 xp deluxe tuner and wonder if i can watch digital cable tv with it. i have comcast basic cable service, and it seems to be digital. now, is there is any way to watch digital cable tv? i'm new to it and will appreciate any support. my pc configuration: amd athlon 5200 dual core motherboard gigabyte ga-m57sli-s4 ram 2gb hdd 750gb nvidia 8600 gt winxp pro sp2 32bit
the analog channels work just fine. bob yes, i have comacastic
but the basic cable usually does not have any digital channels. even if it did, the digital channels are usually above the channels that you can get without a cable box. our basic cable stops around channel 70-75, which are analog.
the basic package and the analog channels match one for one except for the on demand items. bob
