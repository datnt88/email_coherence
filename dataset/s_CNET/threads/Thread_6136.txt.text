i currently use a netgear wgt624 108mb wireless router and associated pci card. i am using wpa-psk network auth, and aes encryption. my question is; with the network ssid brodcast turned off, can any one using a scanner even see my network? thanks, ~jdk
new wifi hack tools now get the ssid just by listening to other packets. since some systems start &quot;dropping wifi&quot; when this is off, my advice is as noted in our forum note. this is dated advice (turning ssid off) and it's time this information was updated. bob
thank you bob. i will check out the forum notes!!
