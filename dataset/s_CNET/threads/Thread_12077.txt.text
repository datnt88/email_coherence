is there a stable storage software at a good price point that is vmware 5.0 certified and preferably other than ms?
if there is a lesson that has repeated over the years is that storage is not &quot;storage&quot; but a copy. i can't guess how long you've been at this but when you wrote &quot;stable storage&quot; it makes me think you are just beginning to see the problem. keep at it. make more copies and your data may be safe. bob
i was referring to a storage software product that is cost effective, vmware certified, reliable, and preferably runs on linux because linux is the most stable os. suggestions?
you may have to be more detailed since linux has done storage systems for over a decade. yes, its been that long. any certification is going to be costly and mean nothing to those that lose data. why is that an issue here? bob
