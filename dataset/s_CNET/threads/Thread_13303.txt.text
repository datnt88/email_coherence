ok so i'm no expert with gaming and computers but i heard that single core chips are good for handling gpus. my pc is a 5 year old dimension with a pentium4 @ 1.47ghz. if i added the appropriate gpu, sound card, etc. could i keep the chip that i have and just overclock it?
this is getting too far down on the pole for me to write it will be fine. you also have the limited speed agp slot so i'm going to write &quot;don't bother&quot; on this one. bob
...you mean that my pentium4 dell dimension 4500s has no chance. therefore, i should get a new desktop or replace the parts inside.
specs at  but i see the killer issue here. it's running on the i845 chipset and sdram. while that was a fine value solution back then, this is a drag chute on performance of the cpu. do not invest more than a &quot;value meal&quot; into this box. bob
i'm sure it was around that number. anyways, it seems the consensus is to not waste my time which is fine. i think i'll just get an xbox 360 instead.
compared to new video, motherboard, ram, cpu, power supply i bet you'll spend less. -&gt; from what research i've done be sure your 360 has the hdmi port so you get the latest model. bob
thanks i'll make sure...i plan to get the pro model with the 20 gb harddrive. the arcade model and elite are too little and too much for my gaming needs.
