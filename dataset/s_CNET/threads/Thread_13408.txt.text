i need help connenting my new printer (canon pixma mp620) to my new macbook pro. i had no problem connecting the printer to my pc (dell xps 200,intel pentium d,3gb ram,running xp sp2)via a usb connection or wirelessly. i connect through att 2wire gateway. i have no problem using the internet with my mac but it doesnt detect my printer.i've read of others having problems with connecting a printer wirelessly with a mac but havent been able to get mine figured out. any help/advice greatly appreciated. holly
do you have the pixma drivers for os x loaded on your macbook pro. i'm guessing that the pixma works well with a usb connection to the mac? p
my printer works fine via a usb connection. it's trying to get it to print wirelessly. it isn't detected.
have you checked the drivers against those supplied on the site by the manufacturer? i had the same problem with my lexmark wireless. i could connect directly but could not use the scan functions. new drivers sorted the problem but it was still a pain using the printer directly as a print server. have you got your printer connected to your router?
