i bought a dlink dl-642 router. when i try to write the username to access the configure page, it doesn't let me in. and when i try to access in user mode it does. please, help me guys.
your system type, os, wireless controllers, isp and any other info relevant to helping you set up your system will help. what does dlink tech support say? and life goes on... jack
i have windows xp and dsl connection. dlink says that i have to restart the router , which i did, but it didn't work. i don't know what to do.
press the reset button on the back. it'll restore the router to factory configuration and the username to &quot;admin&quot; without the quotes. proceed from there. if you have some custom settings you'll have to redo them.
turn off both modem and router. crank up the modem...wait. crank up the router. what happens when you hook up your computer to one of the nic ports (rj45) using a cat 5/6 cable?? do you have all your systems named to the same workgroup? make sure each computer has a unique ip address (this is usually done automatically but....). let us know. and life goes on... jack
