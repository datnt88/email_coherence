i have a time computer with a ms-6390 m/board with 2 256mb memory sticks i have tried installing 2 512mb sticks but it will not work if i install one of each it works i cannot see anything the bios that would cause this to happen does any body have a idea any help considered
had only so many chip select signals so what you are seeing can happen. since explaining why will not fix it i'll stop here and note that crucial.com would get you the right parts.
i have tried crucial and 2 other brands i can only get it to work if i put a 256 stick in dimm 1 and a 512 in dimm 2 ssuspect may be m/board fault
some other arcane thing like a card that is sitting in memory where it should not be. it's rare but not unheard of. i re-read your post and don't find any full list of cards so let's just say it's a bum board. since this is a clone job and no hp when we would worry about the cost of the oem os replacement why not start searching for a new motherboard to accept what you have now?
