greetings, i have a dell latitude e5510 running windows 7 64bit. lately the cursor has been jumping while i type. it doesn't matter if i am in email or word or firefox. i ran maleware bytes and virus check to see if i picked up any thing, both were clean. any ideas what is causing this or how to fix it? paul
turn off the touchpad and use a mouse. install touch freeze  there are too many prior discussions about this so i don't want you to feel shortchanged. bob
hi paul, apart from what bob has suggested, you may try to update the touch-pad driver to the latest version from here . this should take care of the problem. hope this helps. thanks and regards, appu s
