i have an amd athlon xp 3000 2.167 ghz. is this equivalent to a pentium 4, 2.167 ghz?
using amds rating method it is suppose to be equivalent to a p4 3000 or so. you can go to  and read the benchmarks to findout. john
well, you might say so. the amd athlon xp 3000 at 2.167ghz came out around february 2003 and would out perform the pent 4, 2.20ghz in gaming. pentium 4 (intel) doesn't have a model 3000 as it list theirs in processor speed by ghz. they recently changed to show a 5xx model number that easily converts to ghz.
