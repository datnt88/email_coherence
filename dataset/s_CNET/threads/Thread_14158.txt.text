i think i might neet to replace the heatsink and fan over my processor. the fan has been getting significantly noisier over the past couple weeks. are there only certain types of heatsinks and fans that should be used with each motherboard and/or processor? how do i know what is best to get?
it depends on what processor you have. like make and model. john
for some reason the buggers wear out on me alot. you don't need to replace the heatsink as well, though you will need to go online if you want to find cpu fans alone for sale (minus heatsink) make sure its the right size fan for your heatsink (measure your current fan) also you want to make sure its a decent fan. i mean one thats ball bearing and will run fast enough that your cpu won't get too hot. after replacing the fan monitor cpu temp in bios for a bit to be safe, i mean if your mobo has that feature. while your in there you might want to clean out any collected dust on your heat sink. basic cpu fans start around $3 online. you might consider ordering several of them to save hassle in the future and shipping. i mean if you go through them like i do. i was starting to wonder if i was the only one that had ever had them wear out on yah. strangely my case fans are working as well as the day i got em, years ago.
thanks for the advice. i'll be on the lookout for a new fan only once i find a good webs store that can get me the right size.
ok, i've found some 60x60x25 fans i can get for cpu cooling. my existing fan is a dc 12v and .12a. do i need to be worry about about staying with a fan that is still .12a? or can i get one that runs higher? what kind of rpms do i need? my existing fan is an avc model c6025b12l. thanks in advance to anyone who has anything to contribute.
