there's a computer in my house that has a motherboard that can support both legacy sdram, and ddr1 ram can both types be used together, or are you forced to stick to one type?
the types of memory you can put into a machine is dictated by the motherboard and what it supports. just because it fits doesn't mean it will work. you have more research ahead of you as i know of boards that support both but not at the same time. read that manual to see what your board does. bob
with mbs that have slots for more than one ram type, you can run one ram type or the other .... not both. vapcmd
