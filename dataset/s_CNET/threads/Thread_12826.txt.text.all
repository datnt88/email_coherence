alright, my usb is startin to mess up now it won't read the things i put it it [ mouse and all of that ] i really need my usb port for a lot of my musicial devices. 
everytime i put something in it it won't read and if i keep taking it out and putting it in it says something about a power surge. 
should i buy a new usb or will the problems still happen? 
please help me, i'll pretty much buy anything to help my problem. 
see if this helps 
if you pur power surge in the forum search, you may find that &quot;patches&quot; for some machines are noted. 
dell had a few and others too. 
with what you posted, this patch may not be found.

okay i read the page some i'm guessing i need an ac adapter. 
how would i power my usb with it? 
your post was incomplete. 
nevermind that how to on the ac adapter thing, i'm planning on buying a belkin - 4 port usb 2.0 hub [ ]. i just don't know if it comes with an ac adapter - can anyone tell me? 
but your incomplete post doesn't allow anyone to see if there is a patch for your os and machine.

i have no problem since i installed the program (for three days). 
you can try. 
download this file from the above link and save it on the desktop and once it is saved you need to double click on it to run or open to install this patch.

so you get to make many posts until you fill in the blanks. 
and... the issue is not a dell exclusive. 
hp and many others had to issue such a patch. 
bob 
it didn't work 
your laptop maker will supply this patch. the example is to show that the laptop makers are supplying such. 
are you telling us that alienware is not supporting you?
