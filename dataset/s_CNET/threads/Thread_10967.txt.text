my m/b is a asus p5ld2-vm, the chipset is intel 82945g, the cpu is dual core and runs at 26.6 ghz, and i have 4 gigs of ram. i want to install a 3d video card to improve the display. presently i'm using the onboard video. i need a suggestion for buying a compatable video card, that will give me the best performance for the price. any other suggestions are welcomed. i would like to stay under $250.
you need to be a little more precise about the circumstances under which you want to 'improve the display'. do you mean for general use, for games, for cad/cam, etc., ?? vapcmd
i realize that to get really serious about games would require much money. presently the only thing i'm thinking about is using 3d with google earth. i also have &quot;ms flight simulator x&quot; and the &quot;ls99 golf&quot; game. i just increased my ram from 1 to 4 gigs, but i haven't noticed much improvement in the performance of the computer. i suspect that i'm not running anything that requires that much ram. my fear is that i'll spend a lot of money on a card that may not be compatabile to my system, or may not be any better than what i now have. thanks in advance for the help.
but believe you can buy a plenty decent pci-e 16x video card for under $250.  let us know how it goes....you can check the performance of the various gpus units there too. vapcmd
thanks for the advice. i wasn't going to go into the store and just pick up one, and the advice of the so called tech people in the stores near is horrible. i installed a geforce 9400 gt 1 gb ddr2. it was reletively inexpensive (about $75 w/tax). on google earth ad the flight simulator the performace was much better. i haven't tried the golf game yet, but i'm well pleased. i was ready to pay much more. thanks agian, jerry
