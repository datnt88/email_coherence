<s> i am hoping someone can help me out with this: i had a bunch of old stuff (and some spyware i think) on my computer, so i decided to a complete format and reinstall xp. i went through the installation and then updated my device drivers from the cd's.  </s>
<s> everything seemed fine... then i plugged in the ethernet cable.  </s>
<s> it was fine until it started downloading the windows updates.  </s>
<s> it hadn't actually got to the real updates, just the initial update software it has to install.  </s>
<s> i think it was on #2 of 3 when it froze. the mouse would still move, but i couldn't click anything or bring up the task manager with ctrl+alt+delete.  </s>
<s> i was thinking it could be the hard drive, but then i imagine it wouldn't boot at all.  </s>
<s> before the spyware got on the computer, everything was running fine, so i wouldn't think that any of the components just &quot;went bad.&quot; any suggestions are much appreciated!  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> system specs: amd64 cpu nvidia geforce 6600 video card 1gb ram  </s>
<s> i think heat.  </s>
<s> so i pull a side cover and blow out the dust, make sure the fans are all turning, especially the heat sink.  </s>
<s> then try it again.  </s>
<s> i pulled the side cover off and left it off. the fans/heatsinks are all fine.  </s>
<s> i turned it on and didn't even run any programs.  </s>
<s> i figure with the cover off and no programs running heat shouldn't be a problem. the computer still froze after a couple minutes.  </s>
<s> i think i'm going to try reformatting again and turning off the automatic updates to see what happens.  </s>
<s> i've heard of people having some issues with those before.  </s>
<s> and here i was trying to pin all my problems on itunes!  </s>
<s> i think my next computer will be a mac.  </s>
