hi everyone, i bought a new wd hd 1t with sata interface. unfortunately, my desktop is not modern and its motherboard doesn't have sata port. could i install my new hd into my desktop and still keep the old one? thanks for your help. victory.
there are some little 20 buck sata to ide converter boards on newegg.com and geeks.com. these sometimes work. if you can't stand experimenting then place the drive into some usb 2.0 enclosure. bob
with a bios supporting sata drives &gt;137gbs....your old pc probably won't support 1tb drives ...even if you're os supports it. not easy to find same at a reasonable price. vapcmd
