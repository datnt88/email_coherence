<s> i installed a new 40gb hdd and attempted to install xp. the xp cd didn't start so i changed the bios to load from the cd first.  </s>
<s> when i restarted my monitor says no signal received and nothing works.  </s>
<s> i tried a boot disk (floppy) with the same results.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>

<s> during the installation of the new hd you may have dislodge the video card?  </s>
<s> try reseating it properly.  </s>
<s> you said you were able to boot into the bios to change the boot sequence to cd-rom?  </s>
<s> so the screen wasn't blank right?  </s>
<s> just recheck your video card and all cables inside the pc and try again.  </s>
<s> i have no idea if this makes any sense but i got it to boot into safe mode and changed the power setting from home/office to always on (which it was before) and it took off on restart...loading xp now...thanks for your suggestions anyway...  </s>
<s> i spoke too soon.  </s>
<s> xp formatted the disk, loaded the initial programs and did the first reboot.  </s>
<s> there was a small amount of activity on the cd drive, the screen went blank and it been like that for 15 minutes.  </s>
<s> what do i try next?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
