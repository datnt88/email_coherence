whenever i play dos based games and games like nfs most wanted and gta vice city, my pc's cpu usage goes up to 100% and cpu fan produces a lot of sound. this does not happen when i use other apps. atlast, the system turns off. i have a pc with pentium iv processor 512 mb ram, 80 gb hd, d101ggc motherboard please help me with some solutions.
as that's how it is supposed to work there is nothing to fix here. the cpu fan is supposed to make more noise in this sort of system. again, nothing busted here. bob
sounds as if you could stand a hardware upgrade. firstly another 512(preferably more) of ram. a standalone video card, 256mb(512 preferably) and more importantly a heavier psu.
the 100%....normal. cpu fan sound....normal. system turns off....not normal. perhaps it's time to open the machine and do some cleaning. get all the dust out of the machine. get all those fans and heat sinks nice and spiffy.

an underpowered system running taxing games. what exactly is the processor speed? it reads to me like it's a ddr sdram system, thus, is the system meeting the minimum requirements for the games? as the previous poster have mention, the sytem could do use some upgrade of memory, and powerful power supply unit, and also, better graphic card if you hadn't used one.
