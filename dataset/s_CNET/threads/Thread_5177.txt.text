we are hopefuly going to be getting high-speed dsl within the month from embarq, our phone company. they use a 2wire home portal gateway router which they charge $149.00 for, then give you $100.00 off, so basically theyll chargeme $49. however, they do charge big-time for the computer network adapters. they sell linksys pci network adapter cards for about $50. i know i can find my own way cheaper. we have two desktops in the house that will be using the router. mine will be hard-wired using a pci card and my brother's upstairs will have to use a wireless pci card. question 1.) to match up with their 2wire device do we have to use linksys pci devices? intel, trendnet, d-link, intel and msi all make pci network adapter cards also. i was leaning towards perhhaps a d-link or intel, but they use bus = &quot;32-bit pci 2.2&quot; or &quot;32-bit 2.3&quot; i don't think my computer has pci 2.2. my everest utility lists (2) pci, (1) pci-e x 1 and (1) pci-e x 16. it does not list a &quot;pci 2.2&quot; i tried reading about pci and it's designations, but other than &quot;express&quot; (a wholeother animal) i'm not cclear about pci differencs. however, i don't want cards that won't fit, not fit, but won't operate. question 2.) should i just go with the more expensive linksys? it's just plain &quot;32-bit pci&quot;? i want them to be compatible with the phone company's device. question 3.) what cable do i need to purchase for my hard-wired connection? is any one better than another? note: both desktops are about 2 years old. both amd athlon 64 2.0 ghz & 2.2ghz. both have pci dial-up modems that we will replace with network cards. i just want to get the correct ones so we're ready as soon as the 2wire router box is in the house
network capability with an ethernet port onboard. it's rare to find a 2 year old system without. maybe if you could supply some make and model numbers for those computers we can look for you.
1.) aspire ast-180 amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core processors. windows xp media center sp-2 network card removed and replaced with pci dial-up modem. that &quot;upstairs&quot; computer needs a &quot;wireless&quot; pci network adapter card. 1.) abs awesome amd athlon 64 2.0 gb 3200 windows xp media center sp-2. never had a network card...just a pci dial-up modem.
add a wireless pci card to one and a wired nic to the other. plug and play. since network adapters are an industry standard, use the one you wish. i'm partial to d-link. of the two mentioned above, only the wireless will need to have it's software installed.
you don't need to stick with their brandname. and same for the other, install the make and model you can get cheap.
i'd supply a link to the models in question. onboard lan was common 2 years ago.
