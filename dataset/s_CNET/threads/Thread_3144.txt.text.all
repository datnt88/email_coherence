i recently installed a new video card and re-installed windows xp. after the windows re-intsallation, i notice that my sound is skipping quite a bit and other things sputter a bit, as well. 
such as mouse and page movement. 
sound is most noticable, though. 
any suggestions?

after a reinstall of the os, the next step is to load any motherboard/chipset drivers, then updated for xp sound/video/modem/nic etc drivers. 
don't forget windows updates. 
drop your hardware acceleration one notch at a time until it plays correctly.
