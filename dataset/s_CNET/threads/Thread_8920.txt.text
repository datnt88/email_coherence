check your computer for any virus, spyware, adware etc. scan with all anti virus, anti spyware, anti adware utility, plus do an online scan .. problem with sp2 is cause by a problem computer in the first place. after you do that, you may try to reinstall the sp2 and then reinstall wusb54g driver..
please remember that sp2 installs a firewall program that you need to deal with to get internet access back.
