<s> i know there are already 100's of post about dell, good, bad, are they best etc. etc. i thought i would post some comments in regards to my recent experiences with dell.  </s>
<s> sorry if this is too long... i cannot say if my purchase is &quot;better&quot; than it would of been with other places,or if dell is &quot;the best&quot; - i do not feel qualified enough for that since this is only my 3rd pc i have bought in 14 years (the other two being for me, both from a local custom builder place).  </s>
<s> but what i can do is simply tell everyone how my dell experience went and my opinion of it.  </s>
<s> quick background - if you have seen my other posts over the last week + i was looking for a &quot;good&quot; pc for my mom, but did not need to be some super system.  </s>
<s> overall i cannot be more pleased so far.  </s>
<s> i found the prices quite low, the web site easy to use, the options on pc's and configurations virtually endless, and the customer service area (sales) very helpful and nice.  </s>
<s> so far i have loved dell!!! after reviewing multiple posts and reviews, looking at various prices and configurations, keeping the needs of my mom in mind, and ultimately going with my gut i did order a dell demension 3000 with the p4 3.0mgz ht, 512 ram, 80 gb hd etc. got the whole thing with a monitor and printer, tax, shipping etc for $465 (under $500 for a mid to upper p4 with ht tech and printer, and monitor - that i think is great) i set the whole pc up online, then while i could of ordered right then and there i had a few quick questions, so i called the 800 #, got a rep in about 2 minutes max, she pulled my cart up, answered my questions and then i decided to order away.  </s>
<s> i placed the order tuesday at 8:30pm.  </s>
<s> i did have a custom built system.  </s>
<s> they built it wednesday, shipped it that evening, and today (friday) i got it delivered to my door.  </s>
<s> ordered a custom machine on tuesday night, at the door friday - i think that is incredible.  </s>
<s> fired the puppy up this evening, and so far so good.  </s>
<s> i will admit i have not done anything real on it yet except boot it up, it will be off to my mom's tomorrow for her to use.  </s>
<s> anyway, to summarize, great prices, tons of options to customize, easy to order, helpful sales folks (or at least mine was) and delivered in 3 days after i ordered the thing.  </s>
<s> only advice i have is to watch the various sales, they change often (sometimes each day) and depending on what you want waiting 3-7 days may help you.  </s>
<s> for example, if you have a great printer but need a new monitor, at the beginning of the week they were giving away a free basic printer, or allowing you credit that towards a nicer one.  </s>
<s> but the last few days instead they have had a free 15 &quot; flat panel.  </s>
<s> earlier the special would not of helped you if you have a nice printer, but the later sales would.  </s>
<s> i obviously have not had a tech issue yet, i promise that if i do have issues and my opinion goes south after dealing with tech support (which i heard may be a different experience) i will follow up on this post so - when i buy my next pc (maybe in the fall or around christmas)unless something blows up in the interium i seem the be a pretty big dell fan for now... i ordered the  </s>
<s> you're having such a good experience with dell, chip.  </s>
<s> i truly believe that dell is &quot;capable&quot; of making good computers and providing good support...and i'll be watching for your updates.  </s>
<s> who knows?  </s>
<s> maybe things are finally changing at dell.  </s>
<s> maybe all the complaints and the lawsuit are having the desired effect!  </s>
<s> could it be that...gasp...one day, we might all be able to order a dell without fear of &quot;going to hell&quot;?  </s>
<s> for those of you who haven't seen it yet, check this out: jdm (or maybe dell is still just &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot;.  </s>
<s> i guess we'll just have to wait and see.)  </s>
<s> i'm sure your mother is happy with the computer you purchased for her.  </s>
<s> i guess the only thing we can go by is our own experience.  </s>
<s> my experience has been fine with my dell.  </s>
<s> i had a gateway and it was your worse nightmare.  </s>
<s> after the first month i had a rebuilt computer.  </s>
<s> everything went out, speakers, mother board (2 not the first month), power pack.  </s>
<s> finally bought a new one that i had built from a local dealer.  </s>
<s> nightmare again so i paid a restocking fee 3 weeks later for him to take it back.  </s>
<s> i gave him my old pc plus his charges to fix the computer so i decided to count my losses.  </s>
<s> then i ordered a dell in fear and trimbeling.  </s>
<s> thank goodness i lucked out as far as it is still working and i have had it since dec.  </s>
<s> 13, 2004. the only reason i ordered a dell is because i knew a lot of people who had one and seemed pleased.  </s>
<s> anyway glad to hear when people have pleasant experiences with their computers no matter where they purchase one.  </s>
<s> if i was a teck i would build my own and fix it.  </s>
