<s> if heard all about intels core 2 extreme qx6700, but im still a little fuzzy about what computer i should invest in.  </s>
<s> mostly all i do is download movies and surf the internet while chatting with friends.  </s>
<s> in your opinion, which computer should i buy if i were to just download large movies, and why.  </s>
<s> and again in your opinion, which one should i get if i downloaded large movie files and had a few im's open while having a few internet explorer tabs up, and why.  </s>
<s> i think im leaning somewhat towards the apple mac pro.  </s>
<s> but once again, i cant make a decisive decision.  </s>
<s> all i want to do is access the internet, clicking on links and having them load lightning fast, while i have my downloads going.........which i would also like to go as fast as i can.  </s>
<s> i should also mention that price doesnot matter to me.  </s>
<s> thanks for all your help, john  </s>
<s> even though price isn't an issue for you, i wouldn't pay a premium for a top of the line cpu.  </s>
<s> today, a core 2 duo should be fine for what you do.  </s>
<s> since you watch movies, maybe put the extra cash towards a nice monitor or a killer surround sound system.  </s>
<s> any suggestions on a system that will fulfill my needs for the best deal?  </s>
<s> i wouldn't worry about getting a quad-core system but rather focus on having a big network connection where you may connect over some fiber-optic connection if you want &quot;lightning fast&quot; downloads as with the downloads and the ims and the surfing these all share the same pipe which is the connection you'd have and you did say that price wasn't a factor.  </s>
<s> i'd suspect most amd athlon 64 x2s or core 2 duos wouldn't break a sweat on these things and if you have at least a couple gigabytes of ram then you should be fine except for that network connection.  </s>
<s> regards, jb  </s>
<s> i'm currently running a core 2 duo, and it's incredibly fast.  </s>
<s> i would say that a quad core isn't really necessary.  </s>
<s> i agree with the other people, perhaps a lot of money shouldn't be invested in the computer itself, but with other features like a nice monitor and speakers.  </s>
<s> for a monitor i would suggest a dell 24&quot; or potentially a 30&quot; if you are willing to spend the cash.  </s>
<s> a logitech 5.1 surround system like the 5450 would do you very well.  </s>
<s> a good sound card (x fi of some type) and a decent graphics card would serve you well, i don't know how many games you play. if you don't game much, i would suggest a 7600gt.  </s>
<s> i would also stay away from the core 2 exteme x6800, because for about the same price you can get the quad core core 2. for your needs though i think a core 2 duo e6700 would probably be best.  </s>
<s> for movies and entertainment a good sound card/monitors/speakers is always a good deal.  </s>
<s> also, a very nice new tv tuner came out - the vista view saber, which if you have an available pci-e x1 slot it is available (cnet review here: ).  </s>
<s> investing in windows vista home premium or ultimate when it comes out is highly recommended too.  </s>
<s> unless money really isn't an issue at all, i would go dual core.  </s>
<s> but if your heart is set on quad core, i would go with the intel qx6700, with the above components as well.  </s>
<s> ya if u want media fo for da mac,... games&lt;pc pc is alot better for gaming becuase its upgrades are more widespread(my 1200 $ pc is better than any possible mac for gaming) if you want lightning fast downloads look into fios from verizon i got it and i download from firefox@ 4 megs per sec ^_^ hope this helps  </s>
<s> i use a 500mhz, 160mb of ram, 2x20 gb hard drives to download all my 'legal isos of linux distros'.  </s>
<s> i even run peer guardian 2 in the background.  </s>
<s> if you want really nice framerates go for the 7900 gto(its the same exact card as a 7900 gtx eccept no hd dvd wich u might want wif a nice screen but 250$ is cheap for a nice gpu  </s>
<s> ya c2d e6700, 7900 gtx, 2gb ram, a nice mb wud be fine for that  </s>
<s> i run a dell 22&quot; as my primary and a second dell 30&quot; for watching movies/tv on a 7600gt and it has no problems at all.  </s>
<s> unless he needs gaming, 7600gt is fine.  </s>
<s> it's also good for vista (scores a 5.5 and 5.9 in graphics), which will keep him good until he decides to get dx10.  </s>
<s> what speed is your fios from verizon? is it 15 or 30 mbps?  </s>
<s> im planning on having a panasonic th-37ph9uk double as a tv monitor as well as a comp monitor, a ps3 for gaming as well as playing blue-ray movies, and the computer is the last thing i have to decide on.  </s>
<s> sound is my last priority.  </s>
<s> but if i have the cash, ill go for good sound as well.  </s>
<s> si o no in terms of the setup???  </s>
<s> ya its pretty fast, ill download@ 4-8 megs/sec wif firefox  </s>
<s> the 7900 gtx has hd dvd capability wich he might want with such a good monitor  </s>
<s> 7600gt has hdcp as well.  </s>
<s> i can't believe no one mentioned ram.  </s>
<s> having an adequate amount of memory is possibly the most important factor in doing all of those things at once with no slow down.  </s>
<s> (obviously, connection speed is very important, and a good processor too) basically, all the stuff your computer is currently doing is stored in the ram.  </s>
<s> if it runs out of ram, it starts using the hard disk to store data.  </s>
<s> one analogy is that the ram is your desk and the hard disk is a file cabinet down the hall.  </s>
<s> imagine having to make a few hundred trips up the hall every day because your desk is too small. the above recomendations are good (like a quality video card for actually *viewing* the movies) but for the tasks you described, make sure to get 4gb of ram (2gb, if cost is a concern; but not less, or expect slowdowns)  </s>
