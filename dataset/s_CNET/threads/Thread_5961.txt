(sometimes i almost miss win98)i have all of my software and documents there and i hate to wipe it and start over from scratch. can i set it as a slave in my upgraded system, or will this not work either? the new mobo and cpu are just sitting in the box. i had them checked out at a computer shop to make sure they were ok and they checked out fine. i appreciate any help.
