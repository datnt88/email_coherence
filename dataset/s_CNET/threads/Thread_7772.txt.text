i current have a printer simular to the hp photosmart c4480. i am running into an issue and the reason behind me not using it, whenever i try and print i am constantly being told that i do not have any paper in the tray. i can load it with 100 sheets of paper and this happens. i am looking for an all in one similar to the dell printers where the paper is loaded from the top in. i am not sure how good dell's printers are, i know their pc's are good. any suggestions?
if the printer is over 2 years old then try the usual cleaning, read the product manuals for what they say about this (i don't duplicate that here) and then if the printer is 2 or more years old, start shopping. all consumer printers last about 2 to some years. many can't accept that. bob
thats all fine and dandy....do you have a preference as to what brand is better over teh others?
i've used them all over the years but don't bother with lexmark jet printers that you find in stores. i do prefer laser printers and &quot;office&quot; printers from hp but consumers generally don't want to go past 99 bucks so those may not be on the list. bob
