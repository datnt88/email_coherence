right i was wondering if anyone has come across this problem before. now the problem im having is, everytime i try to use i.e i get a pop-up on screen saying windows installing, to which i thought, ok is my computer infected. so i done a full system scan and it is fine, so i then looked it up on microsofts website, and it mentioned something about microsoft word, or that the registry is a little screwed up. now before i start doing anything silly going my microsofts website, to which i dont trust fully, as this error happens everytime i try to look @ a different website, but if i play games it doesnt happen, also it appears on boot-up to which it might be a registry error. the o/s that im running is xp home. so i was wondering if anyone has come across this problem.. thanks......
so am i guessing that no one has come across this before, or in my first post, am i on the right track ? thanks......
windows installer cleanup utility while that may find some pending install, i don't use internet explorer except for windows update. i find it too dangerous and time consuming to cleanup after the pests drop in. after wicu, look up ewido for another scan. bob
yeh i know what your saying.. well thanks for the info anyway, it seems you trust i.e like i trust microsofts site.. thanks....
