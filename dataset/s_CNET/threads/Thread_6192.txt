(i installed win7 on a similar toshiba and everything worked except the bluetooth.) if you're ok with reinstalling all your apps from scratch, just get a replacement hard drive, install it in the laptop, and do clean install of win7. $70 wd scorpio black:  $60 wd scorpio blue:  the blue is 5400rpm, the black is 7200rpm... well worth the $10.
