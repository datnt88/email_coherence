<s> my pc configuration: amd athlon 5200 dual core motherboard gigabyte ga-m57sli-s4 ram 2gb hdd 750gb nvidia 8600 gt winxp pro sp2 32bit  </s>
<s> the analog channels work just fine.  </s>
<s> bob yes, i have comacastic  </s>
<s> but the basic cable usually does not have any digital channels.  </s>
<s> even if it did, the digital channels are usually above the channels that you can get without a cable box.  </s>
<s> our basic cable stops around channel 70-75, which are analog.  </s>
<s> the basic package and the analog channels match one for one except for the on demand items.  </s>
