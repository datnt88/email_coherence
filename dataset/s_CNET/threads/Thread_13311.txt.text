my neighbor across the street has wireless, he is offering to send it across the street to us. what equipment would we have to have to accept the signal. would a simple router do or do we need something special. our house isn't set up for any cable or dsl.
wireless enabled pc and if his signal is strong enough, connect to his network. i'm not a lawyer, but others have pointed out that this arrangement may test the limits of legality. but then, who travels 65mph?
as long as your neighbor agree, its not going to be a problem.
my cable contract allows me to connect to multiple systems on my premises only. intentionally sharing with a neighbor (if discovered) would be a contract violation, and could result in termination of service. of course, if the neighbor were tapping in without my permission, i should be off the hook. but then in florida, some parts of calif., and possibly in some other areas, he could then be charged with theft of services. so, it all depends -- frank
