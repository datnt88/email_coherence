<s> &quot;what exactly does liquid cooling cool off?&quot; in the case of desktops, the current models cool the cpu.  </s>

<s> as bob says, the cpu.  </s>
<s> just like your automobile, the pc has an &quot;engine&quot; that gets hot and can get hot enough to stumble and fall without adequate cooling.  </s>
<s> mostly this occurs when one attempts to push the cpu beyond it's reasonable capabilities....for who knows what good reason.  </s>
<s> liquid cooling systems are similar in concept to automobile cooling systems in that they circulate cooled liquid to the &quot;engine&quot; and hotter liquid away in an enclosed system.  </s>
<s> hopefully it will never leak or more than the cpu may be damaged.  </s>
<s> my computer runs so hot now, that i have a 12inch fan blowing directly into the case, so, water cooling might be my only other option, thanks  </s>
