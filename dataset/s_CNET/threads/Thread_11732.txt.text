i have an internal dsl modem that has internet connection sharing enabled and a network switch connecting it to the other computers in the house, and my xbox. however, i can't get my xbox live to work. i input the dns server values that my isp gave me. every time i try to connect it comes up with an error that says &quot;network services (dhcp or ppoe) were not found&quot; i know that i do not have a ppoe dsl connection. help me please.
tell the make/model of the router. bob
it is actually not a router it is a network switch, here is the info: it is a belkin 5 port switch
a switch will not work unless you pay up for a second ip address from your isp. it's about 30 to 50 bucks a month so most go get the router. bob
why can i access the internet from the other computers connected to the switch without paying for the extra ip's? also how would i use a router if i have an internal dsl modem that cannot be connected directly to a router? thanks so much for your help.
you are likely pilfering some addresses and they will shut you down if they find out. best of luck figuring it out. bob
