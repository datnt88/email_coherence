<s> h-e-l-p thank you,  </s>
<s> its always cheaper to buy individual parts and pop them in your old case.  </s>
<s> a typical upgrade would be getting a new mobo/cpu, more ram, and maybe a bigger hard drive.  </s>
<s> if your a gamer a new video card is always a must.  </s>
<s> seems to have the best deals on parts.  </s>
<s> dll/'s are software files.  </s>
<s> perhaps you just need for do a repair install of the software.  </s>
<s> better yet, format the drive, then do a clean install.  </s>
<s> if the machine is satisfactory and the dll issue is the only problem, this can be repaired.  </s>
