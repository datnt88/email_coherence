14410	7	195060	2107048	2104110	seekdestroy16	8/2/06 7:40 am	1.1545044e12	didn't totally answer my question but...	could you give me a link to the one you got? or does it really matter what brand or w/e your cantenna is? i am thinking of getting one off ebay because they seem to have them for pretty cheap. but back to my previous unanswered question: &quot;plus how would i hook it up?. i want to hook up a cantenna to a wireless pci card on my computer and connect to a wireless internet connection...is this possible?.&quot; is it?. what i mean by wireless connection is....wifi...a wireless router..etc
