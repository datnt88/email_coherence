<s> i am just curious on the subject of my old dell dimension 8400 w/ a pentium 4 3.4 ghz prescott single core with hyper-threading vs. my new thinkpad with a e-350 amd processor dual core.  </s>
<s> i know the p4 has a much faster clock speed, but the e-350 has newer microarchitecture.  </s>
<s> which processor would be faster in playing a multi-threaded game, considering they have the same video card, ram, etc.?  </s>
<s> and find those cpus to see which did better.  </s>
<s> i found out that the e-350 has a higher rating (749 vs 541).  </s>
<s> wow.  </s>
<s> tech has advanced so fast.  </s>
<s> it's hard to believe that my tiny thinkpad is faster than my giant dell 8400.  </s>
<s> this interested me a little more than pure speed.  </s>
<s> there are new ratings that give us &quot;how many watts per megaflops?&quot;  </s>
<s> it's sort of a miles per gallon for computing.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> which processor do u believe will give higher fps for playing cod4, an first person shooter game, considering the graphic cards are equal?  </s>
<s> doa sadly.  </s>
<s> why not try the cod4 demo and see how it turns out?  </s>
<s> wow. cod4 indeed ran better on my amd e350, but probably because the graphics card my e350 is paired with is far far superior to my p4 graphics card from 2004.  </s>
<s> i'm gonna have to get a new desktop....  </s>
