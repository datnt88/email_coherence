i'm wondering which processor should i get? i do play games a lot, but not hard-core games. only like dota warcraft 3 and wow. which one should i get? thanks
let's just say that the i5 is the better choice today without the downsides. have you done your shopping and talked to others with i7 laptops? many gripe about the heat. bob
except the rare dual core i7. that one is pretty cool compared to the quad cores. keep in mind this changes monthly with new models. bob
