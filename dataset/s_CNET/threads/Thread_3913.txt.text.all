i currently have a laptop from acer that is almost 4 years old. 
at the time it was nice but now is good for little more than running a few internet windows. 
i've been looking for a computer that isn't the best but is good enough to play the new games that are coming out now. 
and probably has room for expansion and/or replacing old parts with newer ones later. 
not looking to spend a lot but not sure where to start. 
probably less than $1000. 
whatever would work, maybe cheaper. 
such as this one for under 700. the case that comes with it is weird so maybe i'd wanna make it look more plain. 
and i'd need a monitor. 
please?
