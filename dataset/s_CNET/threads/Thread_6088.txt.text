hello i want to buy a new computer and just have a limited budget. so i thought about buying the new intel e4700 with 2gb ram and a hd3850 /256mb. i just don't know if the e4700 is really fast enough to run vista in an acceptable speed... please tell me your opinion.
learn memory management and see what the benchmarks are for other operating systems- and by this i mean non-windows and non-mac. honestly, buy it and go for linux/gnu or *bsd.
can you actually afford it and will another processor do the same job? all cpus in the same family have the same cpuflags and will mxecute the same instruction set(s). internal speed is more important and if smp isn't readily supported, you won't b e getting the performance you want. also, remember that 64bit systems cannot run certain applications nwithout a compatibility layer. (this is an added comment to the above post.)
vista can run on single core pcs and the e4700 is as fast as an athlon x2 5000+.
