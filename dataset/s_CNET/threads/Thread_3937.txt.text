i am considering buying a lcd wide screen monitor but i don't want a circle to look oblong. will the computer compensate for the wider screen and keep the same aspect ratio as i had with the standard monitor?
the software you use will have to do that. for example, i don't have an issue with browsers or irfanview. bob
on your video card. my main pc's video card has a lot of resolution options and i was able to find one that worked. my other pc's video card did not have the proper resolution and the screen was stretched. a wide screen monitor will need something like 1440 x 900 resolution (wide screen). if your video card does not have this available, you'll get a stretched picture.
thank you, coryphaeus! i've been suffering with elongated images since i &quot;inherited&quot; an hpw19 from my son. (it came with his new computer. he couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.) i switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now i have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display. beautiful. should i tell my son? thanks again, ron
thanks ! you solved my problem with a 22.5&quot; wide screen monitor.
