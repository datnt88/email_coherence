i have a new dell desktop that came with a 19&quot; flat screen monitor. now my not so old lg 17&quot; flatscreen monitor is collecting dust. i'd love to somehow run cable tv to the lg, but i understand that's a problem b/c it's not a tv, it's a monitor. so i thought i had the problem licked when i heard i just neededd a tv tuner. so i went to circuit city, explained my situation to a sales rep, and he told me &quot;no dice&quot;. he said i'd only be able to watch tv on the montitor i'm using with the desktop. so now i really have no idea what to do. is this lg monitor now useless???? i'd love to have it display cable tv, while it sits right next to my desktop monitor that is displaying windows, etc... is there anyway this can work?? any help is greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!!
got one of these -&gt;  it helps give the vga display tv and video game console connections. very nice box. bob
thanks for the reply. i actually already tried to order one of those. nobody seens to carry them anymore. the store i irdered it from called me back and said it had been discontinued. so now i'm back on the prowl.....
i lucked out on geeks.com. ebay has them now and then and there are other type boxes that do the same. try vga tv converter on google.com bob
