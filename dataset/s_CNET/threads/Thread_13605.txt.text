hi we are looking to get a new pc would anybody be able to advise if we should get hp pavilion all in one ms210 or perhaps dell inspiron one 19 - we need it mainly for sufing the internet, downloading itunes, photos and the odd letter writing. ideally something basic and not complicated to use - any advice would be much appreciated
i doubt that ease of use changes with model to model as they are all basic windows once you remove the name tag. the makers are not altering the windows experience so ease of use is something i'd have to put aside during the purchase cycle. for ease of use i'd have to go with apple. bob
given the two models you have narrowed it down to i would suggest the dell. i am a computer specialist at the school i attend so i have worked on every brand of computer. i own three dells and an apple. based on specification the dell is a bit more expensive but offers a much more robust and powerful machine. also, hp computers tend to come with a ton of applications that clog up your computing experience. dell is a much simpler computer to use. that being said. if you are looking for simplicity, i would agree with the previous message. buy an apple. it might be a bit more expensive but a baseline mac mini will perform in step with each of the computers you mentioned. and it will offer a longer shelf life. coming from someone who repairs computer for a living, you should buy a mac.
