aspire pc windows me intel(r)family 6 model 5 processor 128mg ram i installed a cd/rw drive and when i plug the cable into the cdrom drive, neither drives work. i unplug the cable from the cd rom drive and the cd rom works. i know that this is probably a simple solution, but i don't know it. i appreciate the help that cnet has given me through the years and in the years to come. thanks flora
in the most common scenario, the jumpers were not set proper. many machines require both drives set to cs, others will want one drive master, the other slave. i won't be able to tell what yours will be. bob
also there are a few cd rw's that do not like to &quot;exist&quot; w/ another cd drive. i got one (el cheep-o)
