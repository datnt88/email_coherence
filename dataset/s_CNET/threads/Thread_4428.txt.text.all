<s> hi guys, i have a new printer and don't want to ruin it.  </s>
<s> d4360/hp. is it ok to use non-oem ink cartridges and/or refillables from services like staples and walgreens?  </s>
<s> my last printer 3915 stopped responding, stopped printing and i think it was because of the refillables.  </s>
<s> what do you think?  </s>
<s> you're going to do what you want, but i advice: 1) stick with oem ink carts until the warranty period is over 2) don't buy simply the cheapest ink refills 3) buy from a reliable source(understand return policy) 4) have on-hand the ink cart(s) to continue 5) use a &quot;cleaner cart&quot; when persistent clogs appear, if available that's about it.  </s>
<s> i offer that the warranty period if you use refills they can tell the difference and deny you should you want warranty work.  </s>
<s> it may not seem so but it does happen.  </s>
<s> some ink refillers aren't that keen on using the better componets and provide less than satisfactory product.  </s>
<s> some demanding printers like photo types tend to be very picky over time though the initial period seems ok, fails later.  </s>
<s> i've found basic &quot;text usage&quot; of printers seem more friendly to ink refills, but again it all depends on ink refillers.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> if you use reman's from a place like ijr they are ok. you need to use ones that are remanufatured and not just simply refilled.  </s>
<s> walgreens just uses a big needle and refils them, leaving all the crap inside.  </s>
<s> those are problems waiting to happen.  </s>
<s> ijr dissasembles and cleans the casing then fills them with factory spec ink.  </s>
<s> that is the way to go.  </s>
<s> recycled printer ink cartridges not only save you money but save the earth as well.  </s>
<s> in my opinion using re-manufactured and compatible cartridges are definitely a plus.  </s>
<s> using re-manufactured and compatible printer cartridges can help reduce as much as 500 tons of carbon emissions per year.  </s>
<s> that would be the same as taking 100 tons of waste from a landfill.  </s>
<s> that's a big impact!  </s>
<s> some where around 360 million empty cartridges are thrown away every year in the united states.  </s>
<s> every year this number increases by about 12%.  </s>
<s> right now about 70% of ink cartridges and 50% of toner cartridges that people are done with are just thrown away.  </s>
<s> on top of chemicals from the cartridge leaking out from the landfills to mother earth it takes the plastic in the cartridges alone 400 to 1000 (in most cases closer to 1000) years to decompose.  </s>
<s> so in conclusion i can't stress this enough, recycle and re-use.  </s>
<s> a us federal law, the magnusson-moss warranty act protects your rights when using re-manufactured cartridges on your new printer.  </s>
<s> basically your printer warranty cannot void from the use of re-manufactured cartridges, but of course you should do some research on this law yourself too.  </s>
<s> years ago a refurb laser toner cartridge failed and the maker of the printer voided the warranty and the refurb place would not pay for repairs either.  </s>
<s> granted this was in a country north of the usa, the law may protect you but what a hassle.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> but, it's the little things that count.  </s>
<s> if every one did a little bit to protect the planet it would make a big difference that's my point.  </s>
