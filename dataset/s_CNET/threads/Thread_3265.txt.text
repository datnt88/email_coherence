recently my laptop stopped charging. i believe it has to do with the dc jack having s bad connection since before it completely stopped working it would get really hot. i've opened the back panel of my laptop and can see that the dc jack wiggles a little in its socket. do you guys think resoldering it to the motherboard would fix the issue?
if you don't do solder work, then your choice for this to be your first. if you do such work, then why not? frankly at a few dollars, i suggest you replace the jack. google this -&gt; laptop jack repair &lt;- bob
inside that little plastic connector for the external adapter, is a small switch that selects the power source. either adapter of battery. this jack gets jammed, yanked and pulled six ways at once. it's not uncommon for the connector to work loose, pull up traces, create cold solder joints and burn things up. after repeated repairs from repeated abuse, i just put the connector on a pig tail that hangs through the hole. this keeps that connector area free from stress and can patch around a damaged pcb to salvage an otherwise junked unit. an inspection is certainly called for.
since you can look at the dc connection, internally be sure what' s what. solder being loose or contacts are wiggle able should be soldered. however, many times, a minor crack is present on the pcb(board) so be sure all is well. you can even re-enforce it abit by placing a short piece of wire to hold more solder and thus brace it up provided that can be done at all. tada -----willy
