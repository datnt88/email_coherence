is there any where to purchase the controler board for a maxtor maxline plus ii 250gb ata/133 drive. this is a backup drive which we fried. any used supply/parts vendors out there? thank you.das
then remove the good board?
i have seen faulty drives placed on ebay for such purposes. they tend to auction really cheap. you will stumble into ebay &quot;stores&quot; that have a lot of used and &quot;as is&quot; computer hardware. i never spent money to tinker with hard drives in such a manner, though. if you perform the operation, let us know how it goes. personally, i go for new drives. rebate specials on 250gb and larger drives for $70-$100 are more attractive to me. the warranty is nice, too.
