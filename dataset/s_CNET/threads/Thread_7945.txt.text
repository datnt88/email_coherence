hi, i have a computer with ubuntu installed on it. i have 2 agp graphics cards and i don't know which one is better than the other. any suggestions will be very appreciated. here they are: 1- geforce3 ti 200 2- geforce2 gts/pro thanks for your help.
too close to call. so pick the one with more video ram and the cooling fan that is not buzzing.
hi, thanks for your help. i just googled that. the geforce3 ti 200 is 64 mb but has a fan that's buzzing and the geforce2 gts/pro is a 32 mb but the fan is ok. maybe i'll just switch the fans.
