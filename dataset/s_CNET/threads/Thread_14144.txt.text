anybody familiar with a thermaltke v1? thermaltake v1 p/n:cl-p0401 i can't register at their forums. some debug error. won't let me register. it is great good reviews and all. the only thing is the fan connector is 3 pin. my motherboard is 4 pin for cpu? should i connect it anyway to the 3 and leave the 4th alone? or should i take it back? thanks, confusimo
btw where is the edit button?
the fourth is to monitor the temperature of the cpu. no wire, no monitoring. to compare cpu coolers see this site (it's not mine):  i like scythe. i like noctua fans. see there specifications. get the quietest fan possible for a cpu cooler. they make the most noise.
