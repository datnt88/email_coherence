<s> i've scoured for three weeks for a good solution, and if there is one - i missed it.  </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> i am buying two tablets to place on floor stands at an exhibit.  </s>
<s> i'd like to design an offline interactive presentation with a home screen (~4 button options), and buttons that link to other pages and back home, all within the same presentation.  </s>
<s> it would ideally have an &quot;app-like&quot; appearance and restrict access to other programs.  </s>
<s> i've done some very involved presentations this way using powerpoint action buttons.  </s>
<s> macros/ppsm extensions apparently don't work on ipads or androids.  </s>
<s> i can't get a clear answer on windows rt (some vba restrictions?). perhaps windows 8 convertible could work, but those are a bit salty.  </s>
<s> quick office and office mobile (with 365) were not able to recognize .ppsm  </s>
<s> extensions though sources said they would.  </s>
<s> my understanding is that keynote and prezi cannot produce the result that i want.  </s>
<s> kiosk pro (small cost) seems like it can get the closest to what i need, with guided access turned on.  </s>
<s> it restricts me to an ipad (which is fine) but seems to have a steep learning curve which may be an issue with my time constraint.  </s>
<s> i was hoping to get something in the $400/ea or less range because they will only be used 30 days per year at exhibits.  </s>
<s> battery life, weight, memory, etc. aren't a huge concern.  </s>
<s> i was actually considering the slate 21, but android + no battery... it definitely has very little potential to be used outside of the 30 exhibit days.  </s>
<s> suggestions on software and tablet?  </s>
<s> i'm a beggar because i can't contribute much to this community.  </s>
<s> *grovels*  </s>
<s> some presentation apps in google store but i don't know if they'd suit.  </s>
<s> dafydd.  </s>
<s> we used to do that but today don't bother and just let it run as a presentation.  </s>
<s> while we used to worry about this the cost of the custom app was there and we wanted to cut that cost out so for now we're back to simple.  </s>
<s> for android?  </s>
<s> did you try this search?  </s>
