i currently have a 875p intel 3.2 i run a ati 9800 agp and would like to switch to superclock e-geforce 7800 gs co w/ evga top plate agp. is there any reason i cannot do this? is there any problems i would run into?
run into? as long as your power supply is sufficent, and you have the correct agp slot, i don't see any problem with you switching.
...before you install the new card.
