<s> i bought this adapter from radioshack called psx to usb adapter that lets you use a sony ps2 controller on your pc. the problem is whenever i plug the adapter in the rear port usb ports i keep getting an usb device not recognized.  </s>
<s> i installed the drivers before i plugged it in but that wont work.  </s>
<s> when i install the drivers, i go to the game controller properties and its not there.  </s>
<s> i then tried another game adapter and it worked. the adapter keeps making windows xp say usb device not recognized and a window shows something that says unknown device.  </s>
<s> i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that doesnt work. the adapter comes with a driver cd and i used that.  </s>
<s> i downloaded a driver from the radioshack site and it still doesnt do anything.  </s>
<s> sometimes when i plug it in it says found new hardware adn ready to use but nothing shows in the game controller properties.  </s>
<s> i used it before before i reinstalled xp due to a mobo replacement and it worked before.  </s>
<s> any help on this?  </s>
<s> because as far as i know there is no ps2 emulator out there that can play ps2 games on the computer...so y would u try to plug in a ps2 controller into your computer?  </s>
<s> what..u dont like the game pads designed for pcs?  </s>
<s> maybe your gamepad is messed up.  </s>
<s> go back to radioshack and exchange for a new one, and it that doesn't work, call the company of the gamepad, cause they chould help you out...  </s>

<s> i know ps2 emulators arent working good yet.  </s>
<s> i have one for my gamecube and it works when playing pc games like gta or halo. it worked before i reinstalled xp and now when i plug it ,it keeps saying usb device not recognized.  </s>
<s> i dont have the receipt and the adapter doesnt have a brand name except for radioshack.  </s>
<s> what kind of a crappy gamepad do you have?  </s>
<s> a radioshack brand?  </s>
<s> wow, you could have just gone to compusa and get a rumbleshock pc gamepad for only 20 bucks after mail-in rebates( depends on where you live, i live in millbrae, california)  </s>
<s> how much did you pay for your &quot;radioshack&quot; brand pc gamepad???  </s>
<s> i've seen pics of it in the internet and it was recommended.  </s>
<s> now i wasted 11 dollars on this.  </s>
<s> i dont know how it worked before i put a new motherboard in.  </s>
<s> its not the usb port because another adapter i have works.  </s>
<s> i have the original packaging but not the reciept .  </s>
<s> i need some way for it to get detected.  </s>
<s> it keeps saying unknown device in device manager and has no !,? or x next to it. it says drivers are not installed when they are.  </s>
<s> here is a pic of it.  </s>
<s> does it work on any other usb ports?  </s>
<s> same thing on all ports.  </s>
<s> -this is a site to download patches for games so you don't need cd to play the games, but there is a link there that you can go into which they sell all kinds of adapters for all consoles into your pc. i bought my xbox-to-pc adapter there for really cheap, and that thing works flawlessly... happy hunting!!!  </s>
