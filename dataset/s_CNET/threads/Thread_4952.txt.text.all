<s> yes, i do have the antivirus monitoring off for that drive.  </s>
<s> that helps somewhat.  </s>
<s> but simple things i do keep waking up the hard drive and it is loud.  </s>
<s> for example, i deleted a .txt  </s>
<s> file from my desktop, (that i just created now).  </s>
<s> their was a 10 second delay until the external drive woke up, then the file was deleted into the recycle bin.  </s>
<s> now the drive will be loudly humming for the next 20 min until it sleeps again.  </s>
<s> drives to make sure they're alive and well.  </s>
<s> but why is your drive so noisy?  </s>
<s> i've got half a dozen of them from seagate and wd, and i hardly ever hear them.  </s>
<s> for example the age old problem (one of too many so you keep digging) is that if some item in recent documents points to that drive then a save to a text or an file updates the recent documents and windows checks that all those recent documents entries still exist.  </s>
<s> it's burned deep into this os so to fix this you change oses.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> and my externals are often unplugged and in the safe.  </s>
<s> these are backups and no need to be online at all.  </s>
<s> another thing i found is to move to 2.5 inch drives.  </s>
<s> less power and hum.  </s>
