<s> hi, recently my cpu dropped 3 feet and ever since my fan is being weird, it would make noise from a cold start up and stay at 2000-2020 rpm, once it hits higher rpms(2300+)the noise would get low and lower as the rpm goes up.  </s>
<s> anyway i can fix this problem?  </s>
<s> ty! -amjed my cpu: 3.0ghz intel4, windows xp, 500 watt spu.  </s>
<s> since we can't fix said fan, we buy a new one and replace the failed unit.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> seriously, open case and inspect the fan(s).  </s>
<s> if the cpu one, then replace for the small cost and the duty it does, why not.  </s>
<s> do this asap, it can only fail entirely later.  </s>
<s> robert, is right, please replace.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i agree with what has been said.  </s>
<s> yea it sucks to buy a new fan, but it's better then buying a new cpu because it over heated.  </s>
<s> even if it's a case fan, it's better to replace for better airflow, and sanity since bad fans are really annoying.  </s>
