1. the computer is less than 3 months old. computer freezes now at less once a day when on the internet searching. will not restart by ctrl/alt/delete. 2. there is no scan for errors under accessories/system's tools. did window's vista not add that feature to the program? how can you check for errors on the computer with vista? manufacturer - acer model - aspire t180 processor amd athlon 64x2 dual core processor 4400+ 2.30 ghz memory (ram) 1791 mb system 32-bit
with no clues so far, there's no direction except to let them fix it. bob
check this out i had a simalar issue and this driver has helped
unless your running the basic version. untracked thread.
they have the usual 2gb system with some ram being used for video. they haven't told much such as &quot;i added ram&quot; which would have been a fine clue to repair. as it stands, it's a call it in. bob
