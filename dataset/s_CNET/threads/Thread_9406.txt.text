hey all, lately i've noticed a very weird problem on my monitors. i have random pixels that are strangely coloured all around the screen, things are still visible. i am fairly sure it isn't dead pixels as my main monitor is very new, and when i play my xbox 360 through it, it doesnt seem to occur, i have uninstalled and reinstalled different video drivers and it has had no affect. my specs are as follows.. xp sp2 evga nvidia 7900gt/ko acer 22'widescreen and if you need any other specs dont mind asking.
since your card is factory oc'd, you might want to dial it back a bit. use atitool (works with nvidia cards also) to test your video memory and see if its causing the problem:
so it would seem that my problem has gotten worse, now my computer is crashing in some instances, it seems to be triggered by gpu usage. some videos i open will suddenly stop and the computer freezes, then crashes. i crashed while running a test in atitool and it also says i have high amounts of artifacting... is there anything other then buying a new card that i can do or...?
you should definitely dial back your gpu core and memory to stock settings and try it again. also check you gpu fan to ensure it's spinning properly.
