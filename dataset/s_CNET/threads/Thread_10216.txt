5487	2	297717	2790892	2790885	steven haninger	6/11/08 2:34 pm	1.21319484e12	two things to consider	are you saying that the connection is already on property you own but paid for by the company you work for or is it your company's location? it would seem to me that such would first require permission to do so. secondly, your adsl is a line that terminates at a modem that will have an ip address. you cannot connect another on to that same line. as well, the distance from your location to the ranch is only one part of the full equation as the total distance from the phone company's central office to the ranch needs to be considered. you can't just splice in wiring to an existing location and run it to another in this manner. the adsl supplied at your location will need filtering for the phone service so to duplicate this entire setup at the ranch doesn't seem feasible. you might check to see if adsl is possible to the ranch by normal methods first.

5487	7	297717	2791027	2791014	r. proffitt	6/11/08 7:10 pm	1.2132114e12	there are companies that do this.	but all use line of sight rf, laser or such gear and blow past your 1k budget. you can find the cheap diy solutions so i won't duplicate those here. remember that any business would never try to live over such a connection. maybe some hobbyist would. bob
5487	8	297717	2791054	2791027	henrique-s	6/11/08 7:50 pm	1.2132138e12	not 1 mile business wifi, but locally	i poorly explained things here, sorry. this city you see on satellite image is arapongas. i have a small plastic recycle industry and a ranch on this city, those ones you see on image. i'm living on maring, but i am going to move to arapongas on that ranch, it is 70 kilometers (43 miles) from maring. and here in maring i run a service company and do you remember that voip system needs (link above)? pretty good. that system is for the maring's company, and not for this one in arapongas. i'm going to control maring's company call center from an office that i settled in arapongas, and this office is located beside the plastic recycle industry. so the sensitive part of the voip system will not run from a 1 mile wifi , but will run locally inside that office. i just want to have access to this system from my ranch so i don't need to make expensive calls from a mobile phone. and of course, have access to this internet connection. is it better explaied now? so what can we do? again, thank you, thank you all!
