when connected to other computers (xp, me), the adapter is able to connect to a linksys wrk54g wireless router. but when connected to a friend's dell inspiron laptop with win xp pro, the option to connect is greyed out.  my router is the the 'k' one, the unsecured linksys router also shows the same thing. there is an &quot;odyssey network agent&quot; installed (without my friend's knowledge, don't ask :-)) that has &quot;uninstall&quot; greyed out even with the admin login. no &quot;odyssey&quot; shows up in add/remove. no useful google search on odyssey yet.  if odyssey is the problem, how do i get rid of it without a system restore? thanx.
your post is too light for me to comment if this is a driver for some card/ethernet/other. sorry. bob
..that i should include? thanx.
note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
