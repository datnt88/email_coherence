(i should think if it was the ps tho, wouldn't all the all the drives affected? the c drive never goes pio.) thanks for all the help -- fj

8782	16	110383	1338873	1320479	frankzxcv	8/3/05 3:11 pm	1.12308186e12	not the ps. back to square one	okay, it was not the power supply, at least, the new ps did not solve the problem. i am wondering if this is being caused by some sort of problem with the liteon dvd drive. guess i will see if there is some driver patch or something to try - fj
