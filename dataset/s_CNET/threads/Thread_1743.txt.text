i received this message from nero after trying to burn a back-up of a dvd.it seems the whole cd is burnt with information but i can't access it in windows, dvd-rom or home dvd player. i am using nero 5.5 and i have a lg dvd burner. any help would be greatly appreciated as i don't want anymore coasters. thanx
movie dvds are rarely copied with that tool. try dvdshrink. bob
i used dvd shrink after dvd decryptor when capturing the files. when i was using dvd shrink it said there was an error so it couldn't burn it to nero? (i can't remember the exact wording)but all my files were shrunk properly and were fine to burn.
just sharing. i didn't use dvd decryptor. just let dvdshrink backup my dvd. your procedure is yours. i prefer simple. best of luck and remember i can not offer any support for this program. bob
thanx
