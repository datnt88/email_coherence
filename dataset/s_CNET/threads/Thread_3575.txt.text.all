<s> .. compaq (circa 1998) running windows 98 and a pentium i (!) is it worth/possible updating the motherboard and procesor to achieve better results?  </s>
<s> or do i need to buy a whole new computer (since i already have the case and a decent sound/video card) thank you!!  </s>
<s> the pentium i or plain pentium was a max.  </s>
<s> of 233mhz. the pii was better up to 800mhz, i believe.  </s>
<s> even, if you had the better pentium, the advances are so great that getting a new system of at least 2.0ghz or better is well worth the expense, some are only $500 for a complete system , including s/w, you do the math.  </s>
<s> check around... enjoy -----willy  </s>
<s> for your situation and the age of the machine, i'd recommend starting over.  </s>
<s> replacing the motherboard and processor will require new memory, since your old is not likely to work with the newer hardware.  </s>
<s> if you don't require the very latest technology, just an everyday machine for email and surfing the web, as well as business purposes, you can pick great deals on kits that will save you a bundle.  </s>
<s> heres a link to one such machine and there are many others.  </s>
<s> best of luck  </s>
<s> basicaly you need a whole new pc. even if your case is a good atx case you will need a new psu, i'm guessing that since you have a pentium 1 that you have an at case which will not work with the new mb. also the cooling needs have gone up so you will have to add case fans.  </s>
<s> yours is a pentium 1 the current is pentium 4, so 3 generations old.  </s>
<s> john also check out  </s>
<s> i just labored over this decision myself.  </s>
<s> i had (still do) a bto system with an msi motherboard, 2.66 ghz processor & 1 gb ram, ati radeon 9700 pro video card...not a slouch by most people's standards but i had it built in 2000 and i'm a mega power user (database, graphics, huge files).  </s>
<s> i checked out upgrading so i could get a 3.8 ghz processor & 2 gb of ram (to start).  </s>
<s> changes in technology over the years rendered most of the parts i would have kept in compatible with the new motherboards capable of supporting the 3.8 processor... upgrade parts would have costed $1700 --- bought a new dell dimension xps on sale for $2300 and kept my 2.66 in tact (networked in as a backup system).  </s>
