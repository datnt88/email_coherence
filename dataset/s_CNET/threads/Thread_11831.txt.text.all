<s> i am endeavoring to learn win xp pro for the 70-270 exam. the training book came with a 120 win xp pro os disc uprgrade.  </s>
<s> my laptop runs win xp home.  </s>
<s> i don't want to upgrade to the temporary system for it to mess things up.  </s>
<s> win xp home takes up the entire hard drive.  </s>
<s> repartitioning is is very difficult if not impossible to fit it on the same drive.  </s>
<s> do you think i could get an external hd and load it up with the home and then use the upgrade and then boot from the external for training purposes?  </s>
<s> my only other alternative is to purchase the full win xp pro upgrade and use it forever and ever.  </s>
<s> this isn't the worst choice and perhaps the best.  </s>
<s> your opinion is deeply appreciated.  </s>

<s> windows (any version) does not run from usb or firewire drives today.  </s>
<s> partition magic could partition without wiping out your xp home and you could perform a parallel install.  </s>
<s> for not much more you could install a new hard disk and use that.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the new hard drive sounds pretty interesting.  </s>
<s> i don't want to go through the reconfiguring of all my browsers, clients and so forth.  </s>
<s> let's not even think about the docs! it doesn't have to be that large of a hd. i'll check ebay and also look at upgrades.  </s>
<s> bob, have you got any microsoft certs?  </s>
<s> any advice on the exams?  </s>

<s> i'm more of an embedded electronics designer.  </s>
<s> it's because of it staff that our engineers took up learning about pcs and more.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i've always been involved with computers but have learned so much due to our engineers lack of response.  </s>
<s> they now wonder why i don't call them.  </s>
<s> they usually confuse the matter more than assist and i get more accomplished without them.  </s>
<s> freaks them out!  </s>
<s> thanks for the advice!  </s>
