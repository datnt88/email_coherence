1060	6	254869	2530811	2530759	andrew2k53	7/3/07 3:21 pm	1.18347606e12	apologies	what demos? i'm sorry i can't seem to realize what you're asking. i might as well just trash the drive.
1060	7	254869	2530876	2530811	r. proffitt	7/3/07 4:48 pm	1.18348128e12	just those words in all capital letters.	to save me time i put words in all capital letters when they need extra attention. the names are easier to find with a search engine. try getdataback and zero assumption recovery at google.com. i don't like to post links since the address can change and others may have the same issue. bob
