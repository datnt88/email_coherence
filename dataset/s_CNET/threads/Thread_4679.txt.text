i can't figure.??? i loaded the cd in the new computer, but nothing happened to indicate anything was happening? i know the cd is good because it is a back up and was used to load from before. i'm new at this operation!!! thanks much.
where did the cd come from? computer mfg? did you make the cd yourself? what media type is it (cd-r, cd+rw, cd-rw, other)? what type of cd/dvd drive is in the new computer?
i used another cd-r disk that had the files i wanted to transfer over. that disk worked. god the job done. the strange thing was. the first one i tried and pictures and other files on it. the only thing that come up for loading was the pictures. no folders! that is what was driving me crazy. i like to get answers!!! but thanks!!!
