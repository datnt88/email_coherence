hi, i just built my first computer and it actually works!! the issue i'm having is there is no sound. the motherboard i purchased has a sound jack, so i thought i didn't need a sound/audio card. do i need to add a sound card, install a driver from of the cds that came with motherboard, other??? and yes, i checked the volume level on both the monitor and computer. here's the link to the motherboard i bought.
what i find is many of the newer home pc builders are unaware of how windows installations work. that is, it's a very old system that rarely works on its own. bob
you do need to install drivers from that. you didn't mention your os but let's assume it's windows. windows won't have all the needed drivers. a trip to &quot;device manager&quot; will probably show you what hardware has been found but not configured. here's where you do this from the cd. you start by installing the chipset drivers and then add the on board devices. the cd might have an autorun feature to help guide you.
sorry, i should have mentioned os, it's ubuntu 10.04. i browsed the cd, i don't see a linux driver. not saying it's not there, i'm just looking for the file name that says linux in bold letters with lights flashing etc. any thoughts?
also, without a working link or make and model number folk can't look for you. bob
11.01 just recently came out and i loaded it on, but didn't care for it. i'll eventually install it, but until i get my computer up and running like i want, i think i'll stick to an operating system i'm somewhat familiar with. i'm very very new to linux. i'm not sure what happened to the link. here's the make and model and i posted the link again. gigabyte ga-p67a-d3-b3 lga 1155 intel p67 sata 6gb/s usb 3.0 atx intel motherboard
does not list a single linux driver. time to ask for these in the ubuntu forums. about 11.01. i see 11.10 at the ubuntu site. since you can run that live without installing you should be able to test the sound there. bob
thanks bob!!
