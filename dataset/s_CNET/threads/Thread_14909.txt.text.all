<s> this is not actually a question, but a solution that i found to my problem.  </s>
<s> thought this solution may help some people as i came accross many unsolved problem of this kind.  </s>
<s> problem : i had bought a bluetooth dongle/radio which was a china make, im not sure.  </s>
<s> when i connected to the pc it showed &quot;usb device not recognized&quot; message even though bluetooth support is present in xp service pack 2. the reason was that the device wasnt in the verified or approved list of bluetooth devices in xp. so finally i had to try the cd that came with the dongle.  </s>
<s> it had version 1.4 of blue soleil.  </s>
<s> i installed it and every thing became fine.  </s>
<s> bluetooth dongle worked but only through bluesoleil not the default xp bluetooth manager, that meant i had to run bluesoleil manually before connecting the device or else there was no &quot;device connected&quot; message by the system.  </s>
<s> bluesoleil had the device drivers in it.  </s>
<s> after installation of bluesoleil that cd remained unused in my bag , and due to friction with other materials it got harshly damaged.  </s>
<s> one day i accidently uninstalled bluesoleil and when i tried installing it from my cd it refused as the cd was damaged.  </s>
<s> i downloaded a copy from net, both version 1.4 and 1.6 and out of my surprise it didnt work either !. i wasted 2-3 days googling for alternatives but couldnt find much help on it.  </s>
<s> some pages gave me knowledge on where microsoft keeps the bluetooth device descriptions, but i couldnt make use of it in earlier stages.  </s>
<s> my bluetooth device also had no brand or manufacturer which made matter worse to find the driver for it.  </s>
<s> on the box pack it belonged to some local gemini company. the dongle was transparent blue with red led glowing on connection.  </s>
<s> i finally found a solution to make xp recognize ur device and make use of inbuilt manager for bluetooth funtions.  </s>
<s> solution : 1) go to devive manager, somewhere in between u will locate an unknown device with yellow exclaimation mark on it, right click, click properties, then go to details tab where you will find text of this kind device instance id usbvid_1caa&pid_00015&45ea3a5&0&1 or hardware ids usbvid_1caa&pid_0001&rev_1915 usbvid_1caa&pid_0001 2)note down the string next to vid(vendor id) and pid(product id) in my case it is 1caa and 0001 3)then go to c:windowsinf find these two files-&gt; bth.inf this file belongs to ms/xp where all list of bluetooth devices are present 4)find [manufacturer] tag in that file under it in last line add this line-&gt; %unknown%=unknown, nt.5.1 i used unknown because my device had no name or manufacturer.  </s>
<s> if your device is branded replace &quot;unknown&quot; in the line above with your brand name.  </s>
<s> 5)find &quot; ;------------- device section - start ----------------------- &quot; below it all device descriptions are given.  </s>
<s> above &quot;;------------- device section - end -----------------------&quot; add these lines-&gt; [unknown.nt.5.1] usb bluetooth radio= bthusb, usbvid_1caa&pid_0001 replace 1caa and 0001 by your vid and pid and unknown by your device make if present.  </s>
<s> 6)save the file and plugin your bluetooth device it will be detected.  </s>
