i have a silly question. i have a hp laptop, cost me a little over 2 grand. it has wireless built in, but i've been told by a friend that i could get better wireless with an orinoco pc wireless card. my question is, can i still use this pc card if i already have wireless built in. wouldn't it mess things up a bit? thank you all. geoff.
the orinco is a nice card but my cheapo acer is connecting 2 houses down the block to my wpnt834 just fine. why would i need to do better than that? bob
1.) the laptop has a better antenna, it's built around the perimeter of the screen. how big could the pc card antenna be? 2.) better as compared to what? wireless b, g, and n have limits that cannot be surpassed. 3.) go ahead and buy it and try it but make sure you can return it if (when) you don't see any difference. wayne click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. beauty is in the eye of the beer holder.
