<s> high my q-tec 550w dual fan psu gold has developed a noisy fan and despite a thorough cleaning it's still doing it.  </s>
<s> i'm guessing it's on it's way out.  </s>
<s> do you know if i can get spares for q-tec psu's, i've had little joy looking online but i did read in a review that the fans are easily replaced and just have the 2 pin connector.  </s>
<s> i can do it i just need a new fan.  </s>
<s> would a fan from another model/make fit it or are they likely to vary?  </s>
<s> can i get a spare anywhere?appreciate  </s>
<s> any help thanks  </s>
<s> normally generic things.  </s>
<s> take the fan out of the psu and see if there is a make/model number on it.  </s>
<s> research that number.  </s>
<s> if no joy.  </s>
<s> take the fan to your local radio shack or best buy.....see what they have to offer.  </s>
<s> fan sizes are pretty common.  </s>
<s> however, if you're looking a &quot;glitzty&quot; type fan like led lite or similar, then verify what you get. a plain old fan is bound to be in the 60, 80, or 90mm size even a 120mm(thought it).  </s>
<s> anyways, online vendors offer the fans, check this one and others: google for others you can also try to &quot;lube&quot; the old fan.  </s>
<s> remove it and usually under the sticker covering the center area, peel back a little.  </s>
<s> place a drop of light oil/3-in1 oil at center spot and allow it to seep in.  </s>
<s> return sticker and/or tape it there and return fan to operation.  </s>
<s> if you like with fan in hand visit the local radio smack store and find replacement or trace the fan outline and keep it for reference.  </s>
<s> make sure any new fan you get has the number of wires that matches the old one.  </s>
<s> fyi- i said, light oil, not wd-40 or anything like that.  </s>
<s> using this will in time defeat the lube, as it too quickly cuts away the lube properties, while oil tends to remain.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
