hi, just got this ibook 12&quot; in the mail been to a mac shop before i bought it where the owner was told the screen had died. motherboard was said to be ok by the repairer i replaced the screen with a know working one and the screen was dead. then after the fiddle of pulling it apart again wondered if i could use the hard drive on another ibook. the hard drive i put in another ibook which loaded up fine with display. later i tried again but it was a dead screen? *is it that both ibooks have faulty motherboards? motherboard determines a display? or could it be the display module ? what else could cause dead screen? cables good. cheers cas
then try applying pressure, squeezing, to the left of the trackpad but on the same level you may be surprised at the results. the ibook g4 was notorious for this problem which is caused by broken solder joints on the graphics chip connections to the logicboard. p
hi, thanks i pressed on the area and there was sort of change. it opened up on it's own last night and worked perfectly, some flashing of screen, but worked. can the solder joints be repaired? read that you can re-heat this area to re-solder/ place bit of lino in case to pressure the spot............. or do you just end up with a pile of un-fixable ibooks? is the earlier clamshell less faulty? cheers cas
the trick is to find someone who can do it. google for it, there are places that specialize in all sorts of things. the earlier clamshells were less faulty but, on the other hand, they only had a g3 processor, went slower, not all had firewire but they were built like the proverbial outhouse. p
