<s> is there any software available, other than hp, that will do simple scans with the hp scanjet 4850 scanner with descreen ability?  </s>
<s> when i installed the software that came with the scanner, it installed 10 separate software packages, and neither do a simple scan.  </s>
<s> all are so complicated it is hard even to know which one to scan with.  </s>
<s> i want to use paperport and it will use the scanner, but the descreen capability is not there.  </s>
<s> it only appears in hp essential software, and to use it, the scanner makes 4 separate scans.  </s>
<s> it does not seem possible to save any scan settings that include descreen.  </s>
<s> when i asked hp on-line help, i was told the answer would cost $25.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> aren't there options in the software load?  </s>
<s> should be full or custom, generally you have some options.  </s>
<s> browse the disk and see if there might not be a way to do what you want to do.  </s>
<s> many times if you load the full software package you will wind up with a lot of superfluous stuff you may never use.  </s>
<s> i am not sure with hp units, mustek and some other scanners have many options from which to choose but i would browse the disk and see what you might be able to do.  </s>
<s> i'll look, but if it loads more than the 10 it has already loaded, i'll have to get a larger hard drive !! i am trying a couple of generic scanner programs, &quot;art-copy&quot; and &quot;pro-vue&quot;. both run the scanner fine, and both say they will descreen, but having rpoblems finding that feature.  </s>
<s> probably have to buy before it works.  </s>
<s> thanks jim west  </s>
<s> i got to thinking about your issue, descreening.  </s>
<s> generally that feature is part of a software package such as adobe photoshop and may not be packaged with basic software provided with a scanner.  </s>
<s> you can probably download a generic version from the net.  </s>
<s> good luck!!!  </s>
