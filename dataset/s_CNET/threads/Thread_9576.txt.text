my printer, hp laserjet 4, recently just stopped working. my computer is using xp. i have been through the trouble shooter and did everything it told me to do, but it is still not working. it will print a test page, so there is nothing wrong with the printer. i would uninstall and reinstall it, but can't find where to do that. the printers don't come up in the add/remove hardware. also when i click on &quot;find printers&quot; i get an error message (directory service is unavailable) i am not savvy enough to know what printer drivers to delete manually. sigh.... i need my printer desperately.
you said it will print a test page. do you mean from it's built-in feature or from your pc? if it's just from your pc it won't work, it could be a driver, faulty port (parallel usually). give more details about how it's connected. i'm fairly certain these required an enhanced printer port setting in ones bios.
assuming that you loaded the printer software it should appear in add remove programs in control panel and should be removable from there. if you find it and can remove it (from control panel) try reinstalling the software from the cd. when you said test page, from where did you print the page? if you can run a test print from word pad or note pad, the printer is functional, that is a very easy test to run. if not, back to square one.
