canon pixma ip 4700 life cycle cost atrocious. 1)purchased 10/26/2010 ,printed no pictures almost solely back and white text yet as of 11/6/2010 the printer is reporting cyan and black tanks ink low and the printer status shows the m and y tanks ? full while the single black is full. replacement of the cyan and black tanks cost $31.11 for just one month of light use and no intentional color printing. this would mean more than $300 for one year, more than the printer cost! you do the math for the life of the printer! contact with canon technical support confirms my set up was in accordance with their recommended for black and white text. they also noted the printer will not operate with any of the tanks out of ink! i have bought a big black paper weight! have you had this problem? did you find a solution?
the 1/2 did not get printed for some reason lack of font i guess. above should be changed to read xxxxxxx &quot;m and y tanks 1/2 full while the single black is full.&quot;xxxxxx. sorry
while my canon mx870 doesn't do that the recurring lesson is if you want cheap bw printing you get a laser. i didn't read if you had set it to grayscale printing. if not you may find the printer using color ink to create what looks like black from the color tank. bob
agree with you need to get a different printer. was not using grayscale
