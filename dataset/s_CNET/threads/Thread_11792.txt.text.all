<s> i'm looking to buy a new graphics card for my ixtreme 6052 pc, but i'm not sure which one to get, i've noticed this one online: a geforce 6200 card but i'm not sure that this will be compatible with my system, can someone confirm for me that it is, or recommend another card?  </s>
<s> that's a pretty old card.  </s>
<s> here's a better choice for only a bit more: the 7600gs it is much faster than a 6200.  </s>
<s> will that work with my pc though?  </s>
