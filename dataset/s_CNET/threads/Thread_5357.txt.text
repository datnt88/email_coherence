i just bought a dell. recieved it in less than a week. my problem is: when i call customer support, i get somebody that speaks english, but with a very heavy accent. i find it really hard to communicate with them. i think the next time i call...i'm gonna tell them i want somebody that speaks english clearly.
has gone overseas, much has been written about this. tell the person you want tier-2 support. that should get you to another person. good luck, click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. suppose you were an idiot. . . and suppose you were a member of congress. . . but i repeat myself. --mark twain
welcome to the world of &quot;out sourced computer support&quot; via india or phillipnes, etc. don't expect anything to change soon as companies save costs in such out sourcing moves. sorry, but that's the way it is, if you like to do something about it, write(email) your local congressman(woman) and state your displeasure and/or write to dell, not email. good luck -----willy
they are in india
