on the computer, i tried 3 diffeent usb cables but nothing plus it doesnt initialize, all it does is show the power on light
yours (which is?) might have a defect.
it does seem that way, now to fix it
since you move it around a lot from machine to machine sometimes you find a busted cable. do not repair this printer!!! repair costs will exceed the 65 bucks this printer might be found for. yes!!! these printers last about 2 years. if it fails at or after 2 years what many do is curse hp buy another brand, then that breaks in 2 years they curse that brand and try another. in about 10 years they'll get it. bob
