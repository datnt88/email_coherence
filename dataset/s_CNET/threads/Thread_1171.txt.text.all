<s> my 2-year-old logitech optical wheel mouse (m-bj58) seems to be less responsive for the past week.  </s>
<s> it will be working fine, then it will become lazy and barely follow my movements.  </s>
<s> is there any maintenance i can perform to bring its performance back to standard, or must i buy a new mouse?  </s>
<s> if so, which would you recommend for a: hp pavilion pentium 4 cpu, 2 ghrtz, 512 ram running winxp home, service pack 1?  </s>
<s> there's no real maint.  </s>
<s> done to the mouse other than making sure the bottom is clean.  </s>
<s> you should clean-up the system to see if recent installs, etc. aren't tasking the system resources.  </s>
<s> review &quot;startup&quot; pgms.  </s>
<s> remove little used pgms.  </s>
<s> etc. for a better overall operationg system.  </s>
<s> plus, using the latest av updates check for virus, trojans, and worms.  </s>
<s> also, any malware that spybpt or ad-aware may find intrusive.  </s>
<s> if none of this seems to clear up the problem, then maybe the mouse is bad.  </s>
<s> logitec is the best for this type of mouse, but any other should perform as well.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> i had this problem once, was caused by quicktime running mem resident.  </s>
<s> may not be your problem, but . . .  </s>
<s> - fj  </s>
<s> clean the inside of the mouse.  </s>
<s> if this is a standard ball type mouse, unscrew the bottom with a simple twist and take out the ball.  </s>
<s> make sure it's free of dust.  </s>
<s> then, take an eraser and clean the roll bars, they may have deposits of grime and dirt that are making the roller ball slip.  </s>
<s> you shouldn't have to replace it.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
