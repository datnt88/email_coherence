<s> hello to everyone.ihave a few questions and i need some answers.ihave 5 years old computer intel pentium 4 with mobo asus p4p800-x,ram 1gb{2x512},hdd 160gb nvidia g-force 6600.i was made 2 partitions .the  </s>
<s> first working xp i will never change,isuppose and the second partition was windows 7.my question is does it worth to keep it with some more memory or a new video card or to buy a new one desktop with 300-400 euros?iam a daily user i was using for videos, photos, music and a litle games.  </s>
<s> if this was my dilemma, i'd get a newer machine but keep the old one until i could fully transition to the new rig.  </s>
<s> you might even find a use for the old one later.  </s>
<s> they can become decent file servers or test boxes.  </s>
<s> the fact that it can run win7 is a good sign that the system has some more life in it, but it has limited or will reach its end soon enough for a 5yr.  </s>
<s> old system.  </s>
<s> if possible add more ram, but that's about it.  </s>
<s> a new system, plainly said, will have the latest goodies and continue to work as time marches on, so be happy with what you got until you decide to buy new.  </s>
<s> that decision is more to what you feel you need for now, but while you mentioned it, you are really using the old system in a heavy way.  </s>
<s> imho.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> your computer is five years old, indicating its inner parts may be starting to wear out.  </s>
<s> if it runs good however, i would just keep it. the only thing that i may do is add more ram and either another internal hard drive or get a good external hard drive.  </s>
<s> 1gb ram isn't a whole lot but for five years it is very good.  </s>
<s> my 5 year old computer has i believe something like 512 or 715 mb of ram.  </s>
<s> and 160 gb hd is pretty good as well.  </s>
<s> you may want to get a new desktop just because the hardware would be much more efficient and effective; i.e. a faster rpm hard drive or a more energy efficient processor.  </s>
<s> and speaking of processor, a new system would be sure to have a higher ghz processor.  </s>
<s> overall, its really your choice.  </s>
<s> if you don't have any issues with your current system and it isn't too cluttered up or anything like that and has no viruses, i would keep it.  </s>
<s> if it is cluttered, slow, and has some issues with it, i would replace it.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> why not both?  </s>
<s> upping the old one to 2 gb of ram would be the only thing i would do with it. it would extend the life of it for a few more years until xp is no longer supported.  </s>
<s> as for a new system you can either build one, and it sounds like you could (if you don't already), or buy a pre-built system.  </s>
<s> now i don't know currency exchange rates very well, but i've put together an inexpensive system for around $500 us.  </s>
<s> over the years i've built several systems for friends, family and myself.  </s>
<s> my oldest system i keep for old games and other old programs.  </s>
<s> my xp system has become a media server, and my newest vista system is the one i use all the time for everything.  </s>
<s> another plus to a new system is that it should run cooler and use less energy.  </s>
<s> hi kostas, i work in a place where we fix computers so i hear this question quite a bit. the answer isn't always that simple.  </s>
<s> it would be helpful for you to answer these questions: 1. is my current computer doing what i want it to do for me?  </s>
<s> if not, is it possible to upgrade it to meet my needs.  </s>
<s> 2. if i upgrade the computer, will the new parts i buy be usable in a new computer at sometime in the future?  </s>
<s> for example, if you add ram to your old machine, will it work in a newer machine later?  </s>
<s> the same logic goes for video cards and even cpu upgrades.  </s>
<s> 3. if my current computer is usable, will i gain an advantage by putting a bigger, and newer hard drive in it.  </s>
<s> i say this for two reasons.  </s>
<s> first, if you're still using your original hard drive, you should replace it as it's nearing the end of it's life cycle.  </s>
<s> with a new hard drive you can still salvage the data from the old one, and since your system is capable of running windows 7, it's likely to be much faster with a new and larger hard drive.  </s>
<s> with these questions in mind, you should also thoroughly inspect your existing computer to make sure all of the capacitors are still in good shape (not swelling or bursting).  </s>
<s> also, if your old machine is capable of running ddr2 ram, you'll probably be able to upgrade the memory for a very reasonable price.  </s>
<s> if you're using the computer for videos, find out what sort of video card (if any) your current system is using.  </s>
<s> if your board accepts a pci express card you're in good shape, but if it takes an agp type card, upgrading would be a waste of money.  </s>
<s> finally, find out what kind of cpu you're using.  </s>
<s> you mentioned it's a pentium 4, but how fast is it.  </s>
<s> there are a lot of good deals to be found out there for faster pentium 4 cpus up to 3.2ghz.  </s>
<s> don't pay for any upgrade less than 3ghz on the cpu.  </s>
<s> most desktops of this type use a socket 768 type processor.  </s>
<s> you might find that after the cost of upgrading the cpu, ram, and video card, you're better off buying a new desktop but there are good deals out there to be had if you shop for them.  </s>
<s> also you should remember that if you buy a new unit, you'll be getting an new optical drive, at least a dual core processor, in most cases a much larger hard drive, and a probably upgrade to a dvd burner that your old unit doesn't have.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>
