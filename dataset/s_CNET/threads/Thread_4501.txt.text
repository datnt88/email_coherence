hi i have an old pc - p3 lying at home - really slow right now. have been thinking of upgrading it - since i have installed a cd-rw and bought a new monitor. i have been trying to figure out a way of upgrading the processor and changing the motherboard - but being absolutely non-techie - i am totally clueless on how to go about buying a motherboard? some basic questions: - does buying a motherboard only help - i presume not: but just trying to confirm? - what all should i buy if i would like to upgrade from my current p3 system to a p4 system? any brand recommendations for each item? any inputs would be helpful!
it's not practical. bob
you could build a new computer using a few of the parts from you old one, like cd drive, monitor, mouse,keyboard and maybe the case, but new ps. everything else would have to be new. your choice. john
