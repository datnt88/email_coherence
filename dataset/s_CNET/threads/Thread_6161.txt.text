here is my issue. i work in an i.t. office but our wireless guy left and we havent gotten a replacement yet. this is probably a simple question but i have googled it and cant find the answer. i have a few doctors that when they take their laptops home and connect wirelessly, the laptop will not find our work wireless when they come back. we are running vista business with cisco g wireless. any basic troubleshooting tips would be very much appreciated. thanks, dean
is ssid turned on at work?
it's about half way down the page but you can google the setting i'm changing to get vista to connect. here's the words -&gt; vista broadcast flag. sure you can argue that it connects at home. all that will do is have me tell you to replace your wifi router, wap or upgrade the firmware on the waps. btdt, hope you fix it fast now. bob
