does anyone know how to do this? i've got a p5g41t-m lx motherboard and have tried to enable wol through the bios, but can't find anything that looks like wol on the settings. any help would be hugely appreciated. incidentally, i've just been to asus' support site to try and get the answer to this question. i suspect having waded through endless webpages and been required to filling in fields upon fields of irrelevant and ridiculously technical information that they've outsourced management of their support to a direct competitor. it's a lesson in how to test the goodwill of even the most patient customer. (end of rant).
creating a new thread in the asus p5g41t-m lx forums? there is only a few threads listed, so your newly created thread won't likely get lost in the shuffle
hi! did you ever figure out how to enable wol on that particular motherboard? i am currently trying to do the same and i am wasting an awful lot of time... unsuccesfully. if you know how to do it i would very much appreciate your help. regards, nestor
