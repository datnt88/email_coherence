other then going to an actual store like the apple store or a best buy. does apple offer any type of test drive program, where you can sort of rent a machine try it for a certain amount of time and return it back to apple. i am interested in a macbook but i would love a chance to explore the hardware and more importantly mac os 10 before taking the plunge into switching from a windows based enviroment to a macintosh in at least my laptop.
but there are a number of places that rent mac's to businesses. probably only found in large cities though. p
thank you for your feedback, i really appreciate it. can you buy any chance name a few companies that do said services, or any one in particular you would recommend? i have done a few searches online however thus far been unsuccessful. thanks.
current whereabouts, i cannot be specific. i find it a little difficult to believe that you have done &quot;a few searches online&quot; and turned up nothing. my google search for &quot;computer rentals&quot; turned up over 10 pages of hits for companies that rent computers. check it out. p
or on the lines of that.
