<s> hi all, what i would like to do is access my computer from elsewhere.  </s>
<s> i know their are sites that do this for you but i dont want to do it this way.  </s>
<s> what i want to do is somehow connect directly to my pc at home by somehow opening a webpage and signing in.  </s>
<s> i realise their are a lot of security issues to this. also when i am at work they have a proxy that prevents me from accessing certain sites.  </s>
<s> is their anyway i can get past this by somehow connecting through my computer at home and using my internet connection? is this trackable by the system admin at my work if i did do something like this? any links with info etc would be appreciated.  </s>

<s> please don't ask how to &quot;get around&quot; a work proxy.  </s>
<s> that can get your post locked.  </s>
<s> why?  </s>
<s> check the forum policies.  </s>
<s> as to remote access there are a few solutions like tightvnc but i strongly suggest you never risk your job over internet use.  </s>

<s> oops i wasn't away i was breaking any rules.  </s>
<s> all i really wanted to do was access my webmail without getting blocked all the time.  </s>
<s> didnt want to risk losing the job!  </s>
<s> but take my word that you never want to be found out or caught &quot;getting around&quot; a workplace filter. the usual reprimands are getting harsh.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have used this guide in the past.  </s>
<s> works well.  </s>
