<s> hello, i would like to ask what shall i choose for the moment between a new core2duo e6300 and a leadtek 8800gts to gain more performance for the newer games.  </s>
<s> right now my pc specs are: asus p5nd2 sli intel edition, leadtek nvidia 7900gs, creative audigy 4, p4 630 3ghz, wd 120gb sata, 2gb ddr2 800mhz corsair, seasonic s12 430w.  </s>
<s> 5 months from now i will have both hardware pieces but right now i have to stick with the one that my pc really needs so i could play the newer games (graw2 , moha airborne, stalker) at high details and 1280x1024 resolution (not with 2aa active).  </s>
<s> my 7900gs is overclocked at 550mhz(gpu) & 1600mhz(mem).  </s>
<s> if the answer is the cpu is needed the most right now, i would like to know if a e6300 or a e4300 is better.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> there's a huge amount of confusion over that mobo series and its support for pentium-d and core2duo.  </s>
<s> according to asus' website: &quot;p5nd2&quot; supports core2duo but requires pcb revision 2.00g &quot;p5nd2 se&quot; supports core2duo &quot;p5nd2-sli&quot; does not show core2duo as being supported &quot;p5nd2-sli deluxe&quot; does not show core2duo as being supported  </s>
<s> i know that my motherboard does not support core2duo and that's why i will buy a p5b asus.  </s>
<s> but this is not the issue.  </s>
<s> i just want to know if it's better to buy the graphic card first or to upgrade the cpu (and the mobo) to gain better performance for the games that will come out 5 months from now, because after 5 months i will have both of them.  </s>
<s> i'm afraid that if i'll buy the graphic card it will be slowed down by my current cpu, or if i'll buy the cpu, i wont' get enough performance compared to buying a 8800gts.  </s>
<s> i really don't know and this is just for the next 5 months as i said.  </s>
<s> and i would also like to know if a leadtek 8800gts (640mb) will be enough for crysis (on high details and 1280x1024), and of course with an core2duo e4300 (oc at 2,6ghz) and 2gb ddr2 at 800mhz.  </s>
<s> unless you have a game *now* that you can't play *now*, you'll be better off doing your upgrade in a few months.  </s>
<s> intel will be refreshing the core2duo line, ati's dx10 gpus will be out, and nvidia will fill out its 8xxxx series.  </s>
<s> for the money you've got budgeted, you'll probably be able to get a 8800gtx class gpu and a e6600 class cpu if you wait 3-4 months.  </s>
<s> your 7900gs is a very good card for 1280x1024.  </s>
<s> other cards may give higher frame rates, but the 7900gs will still make most games highly playable.  </s>
<s> so if have to spend money now, i suggest you get the core2duo.  </s>
<s> wait for crysis to be released and benchmarked before you upgrade your video card.  </s>
<s> i just got this card a week ago, and let me tell you that it is phenominal.  </s>
<s> i can crank all the settings all the way up on oblivion, company of heroes and supreme commander, and i dont have a problem with any.  </s>
<s> however, i do have the e6600 2.4ghz.  </s>
<s> here's what i did.  </s>
<s> asus p5n sli mobo may not be the best one out there, but it supports up to 16gb of ram, intel's 775 socket processors (including quad core) and of course, its sli capable.  </s>
<s> and its fanless, so its quiet.  </s>
<s> plus, its only about $105, which is cheap for a mobo.  </s>
<s> granted, between all three of those, it cost me about $784, but heres how i see it. the e6600 will be good for a while, and the gfx card will laugh at games for a while to come.  </s>
<s> in the future, when i need to turn the settings down to increase my frame rates, i can always get another 8800 (which will have dropped in price by then) as well as upgrade to a quad core.  </s>
<s> indeed, it seems that i have to wait a while and see how the new games like stalker, graw2 will run on my pc. if it's needed more, i'll get a e6400 and then a 8800gts thanx everybody for your opinions.  </s>
