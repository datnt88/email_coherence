<s> i have replaced my video card (ati 1800x wonder card) with the new radeon 3870.  </s>
<s> i have tried using the wonder card for video capture only but it seems to conflict with the primary 3870.  </s>
<s> it gives me 2 extra displays, but i don't need them and disabled those displays.  </s>
<s> ati tech support said it doesn't support the 1800x anymore so i cannot get any advice from them.  </s>
<s> does anyone know how to set up the two cards to work in the same machine.  </s>
<s> they are both pcix.  </s>
<s> i hesitate buying a new video capture card when the 1800 model is also a video capture card.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> but you'll have to use a current os like xp with sp2, latest bios, motherboard drivers etc. bob  </s>
<s> i will double check again but i installed the new asus magnus motherboard, that has just been released, so i believed it has the most recent bios update.  </s>
<s> will check though.  </s>
<s> also have xp with sp2 and keep up with all updates.  </s>
<s> it seems something will not let me access multimedia drivers, even though i cleaned them out (including registry) and reinstalled the latest from ati.  </s>
<s> oops! mb is maximus formula special edition!  </s>
<s> but having a new motherboard is no sure sign it has their latest bios. the boards are made, shipped via cargo ship, sit in warehouses for months and meanwhile bugs are found, fixed.  </s>
<s> no one updates the boards prior to final shipment.  </s>
