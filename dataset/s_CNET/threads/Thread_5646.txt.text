i need help finding the best wireless networking system. i need it to reach like 500 ft and through maybe 5 walls. what system has the best range and the best for the price. thanks
all stock systems have limited and specific power output per fcc regulations. all the name brands are good, i use d-link. but extenders are available.
so far i've had to install another wap where needed when range and walls impede the signal. bob
i was thinking that maybe the netgear system is good because they have those wall outlet extentions which i could set up all over the house. would this work? thanks for help
i have a linksys system right now, i tried the n range thing but that didnt work as good as it sounded. then i tried the n range and the range expansion from linksys and still that did not work that good. i would get signal then it would go away then come back. what i really would like is a strong enough signal for my ps3 which has a built in wifi signal. i tested it out next to the router and it worked but i want the ps3 in tv room not the computer room. thanks
