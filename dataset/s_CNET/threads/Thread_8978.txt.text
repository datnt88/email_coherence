hello! i'm trying to upgrade my computer to run games such as lol on max settings. please give some suggestions! these are my computer specs at the moment: model e9107c(np238aar) intel core 2 quad q8200(2.33ghz) memory 8gb ddr3 ati radeon hd 4350, 512 mb ddr2 memory sound card - integrated powersupply 300w for more detailed specs, please visit  i'm thinking about upgrading the power supply, sound card, and the graphic card.thanks!
however that will require an upgrade to the psu. what's the budget?
budget is 100-200. thanks
budget is 100-200. thanks
since the psu at that price point is going to be trouble, i'll toss out the next best upgrade.  it's a step up from your 4350 and may even use less watts. if you want to change the psu, get the new big psu in there (i suggest a single rail unit) then with your remaining bucks, use this list.
psu.  gpu.  or.  jockey the numbers around and see if anything fits.

and is there any sound card you would recommend?
while i like creative labs and if they are still in the game, turtle beach i rarely see a reason for this today. why? because if i use hdmi the sound card is not used. bob
