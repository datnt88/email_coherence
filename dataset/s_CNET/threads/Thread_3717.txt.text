i have a data disk that i recently burned on my dvd burner. the disk was nearly full. now, when i try to access a couple of the files on the disk (towards the end of the list) on either one of my dvd drives on my system (i have both a burner and a straight dvd drive), i can't access them. it just stuggles with them and does't play (the files are movies). but i tried playing them on a system at staples, and they played fine with no problem. i have noticed some problems before accessing files on full dvd's. my system consists of a pentium 4 running at 2.53 ghz., 256 meg memory, 2 160 gb hd's, 1 dvd +r burner and one dvd drive, all running under windows me. i know windows me has a 4 gb file size limit, thought maybe that limitation was causing the problem. any input would be greatly appreciated.
if the disc is readable on the dvd recorder then you are proving that the failing dvd drive is just getting old. some will go into denial over that, but we just wait and let the drive fail more and more until the owner caves in and tries a new drive. for now, try a cd/dvd lens cleaner. bob
i had considered the possibility of a drive going out, but two drives at once? along with that the fact that the same drive that i burned the dvd with won't play all of it? i suppose it's possible, but the fact that neither drive will play all the files has me scratching my head. i used a lens cleaner on the drives today, regrettably didnt help any.
one bad one can interfere with the other. it's why you test each on their own. and try a new ide cable (common failure point.) be sure to try a known working drive so you don't waste your days with bad drives. bob
