hey guys, i just connected my dell xps 400 running windows xp to my panasonic th-c42fd18 plasma. the only problem im having is that the screen size on the tv is too big, how do i fix the resolution? (by the way, im running dual monitors, both are displaying the same thing; the picture on the computer moniter is fine, but the tv is too stretched out and doesnt fit.)and how do i get sound to come out of the television speakers if im using a dvi-hdmi connection? thanks
well, almost. if sound is coming from the pc speakers then it's set wrong. try under playback devices (control panel, sound), chang default from speakers to hdmi audio. as to the screen sizes, that's all about video mode settings. i can not offer any exact answer. but you should try other video modes. bob
first, you'll have to decide if you want your display cloned (both monitor and tv display the same image) or your desktop expanded to two monitors. the steps to do this are somewhat dependent on your graphics card (which you didn't mention). also, you should set the pc to use either a 1920x1080 (recommended) or 1280x720 resolution for the tv. lastly, you won't get sound over dvi. you'll need to use a 3.5mm stereo cable ( like this ) to connect your pc's headphone/speaker jack to the stereo input jack on the tv.
to get your pc to run hdmi to your big screen, you would need hdmi capability from pc..not dvi crossover adapter and an hdmi cable, of course.
so no problem here.
your video card might not have a high enough resolution to support the tv. to get sound to come out of the tv speakers, there should be an 'audio out' connector on your computer's sound card, and an 'audio in' connector on the tv, just hook them up.
