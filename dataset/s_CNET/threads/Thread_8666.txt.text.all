<s> i have an external had that i &quot;made&quot; (i got a nexstar 2 enclosure and a 60gb seagate drive) i was actually wondering how the drive spins down.  </s>
<s> when i am done using it i click the safely remove button and remove the usb cable then unplug and power off the drive.  </s>
<s> does the drive spin down when you &quot;safely remove&quot; the drive?  </s>
<s> or does it matter?  </s>
<s> some do, some don't which will make answering how a little tough, but &quot;how?&quot; is that the software on the drive recieved a spindown command.  </s>
