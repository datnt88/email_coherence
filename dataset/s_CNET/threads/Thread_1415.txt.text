i just managed to get my pc to turn on after i got thing wrong with the risers. however, i still have problems. when the pc switches on, the fans go on and light up, but i get no monitor output. oddly my hdd doesent work, but if you take the ide ribbon out of the hdd, it works ???, i tried a really old hdd and it worked with the ide ribbon in but still no monitor output, no beeps to say anything is wrong, what going on?
you need to take it down to the point it beeps. i start with motherboard, cpu+heatsinkfan, power supply unit(psu) and a speaker. it must beep in protest. if not you are looking at the four possible bad or badly configured parts. bob
no beeps, has it died?
tell exactly what happens. list all the parts that didn't beep. bob
it doesent beep at all on bare minimum power and cpu fan, it's been abused for years, overclocked to over 1000mhz despite the cpu being 858mhz, its had pencil lines on the cpu to do overclockers tweaks to it, agp and isa clocking, too high refresh rates e.t.c, now i have a new pc it was my guini pig, so i kind of expected it to break in a way, but i will get it another mobo and sqeeze a few more years out of her as a linux machine
you might have found it finally melted down. try another cpu and check the motherboard capacitors for the issue in this next link. i have a dead socket a board and the cpu lived due to this...  bob
i don't think it is a first gen, correct me if i'm wrong though it's a 850mhz athlon from their 1999 range of 800,850,900,950 and 1ghz cpu's (i think). it's the thunderbird core, so i don't think it's a 1st gen, but do correct me if i'm wrong
sorry, but those did melt. how did the capacitor check go? bob
