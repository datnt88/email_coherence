<s> hi all, i have changed my isp from isp1 to isp2.i had a belkin wireless router configured with isp1 modem for wi-fi use at home.i want to know whether i have to reconfigure my wireless router with the new isp2 modem or will it work without any changes?  </s>
<s> thanks..  </s>
<s> but then you just mentioned a modem name.  </s>
<s> what exactly changed?  </s>
<s> usually, however, your router and modem will operate independently.  </s>
<s> if you get a new modem, it just needs to recognize the router so you can't change them without powering them on in the proper sequence.  </s>
<s> see the forum sticky for that sort of information.  </s>
<s> i'd start with just turning off and on again.  </s>
<s> that should be it.  </s>
<s> i don't assume you configured the router for the old modem, so there shouldn't be a need to configure it now.  </s>
<s> anyway, just try.  </s>
<s> that's the fastest and surest way to know.  </s>
<s> and come back if it doesn't work.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> only if it's a manual change etc  </s>
