i'm wiring our new fire station and need some insight. i will start with a brief overview of our network: cable router to netgear wireless router to (4) wired connections. the problem i'm having is with the levitron keystore jacks for cat5e. i have wired these in 568b format. the wiring was installed by the contractor. all lines terminate in a closet along with telephone and cable. the ends of the cat5 in the closet i have terminated with male plugs to connect to the netgear router. the other ends are in varies wall plugs in the building. i connected (2) yesterday according to the label for 568b. i can't connect on either of these plugs. i have also wired them in 568a and crossover just to try. i removed one of the keystones and put a male plug on to test connection. this worked without an issue. i have tried (3) plugs out of the package of (10). i'm only removing the outer sheath, untisting 1/2&quot;, leaving the individual wire sheathing, and using a 110 punch tool to install in the keystone. i'm sorry this is long winded but i wanted to try to answer any basic questions up front. does anyone have any idea what the issue could be?
i find the colors reversed on those... see  again.
thanks i'll check that. i know it has to be something simple. i had been wiring all day when this issue came up and i chose to walk away as i was getting fustrated. you may very well be right about that. thanks for the quick reply.
