hello, i'm wondering what some of you would do in this situation... ok i need a new graphics card and i was about ready to buy a radeon 9800pro for $200 from msi, but the new geforce 6800 (not ultra and not gt just 6800) costs $275 and will outperform that 9800pro but 2x in most cases. now would you either buy that 9800pro or would you save that extra $75 and go for that 6800 from evga? thanks
this is one of those areas that you have to look at your application. a gamer may opt for that lastest card. bob
ok, well for me the application is games, but i also want it to last for at least 14 months, so that is the agrguement in favor for the 6800, it supports all of the latest technologies, and its faster. but the 9800pro still can come in costing less and performing very well at various games. do you think that the geforce 6800 in 14 months will be the same as a geforce fx 5800 is today, still performing great but basicly phased out? any ideas on how long it should be considered top range? (i ask that because i don't want to be buying a new $200-300 part every 8 months)
did your last card last 14 months? if not, why didn't you get that much out of it? as to the card being the top of the range, once you get near the top, the top position can be a tenuous thing since a better video driver could cause the number 2 card to move ahead. if you are in the top 10, then you can run any game offered today. bob
