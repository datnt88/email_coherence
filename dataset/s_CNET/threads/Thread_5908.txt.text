no need to describe the specific layout or application in this situation, just a quick question that requires a simple answer. background: in my hardward configuratoin for a certain computer setup, a drive must be taken out and put back into a bay daily. the bay is conected by an ide/eide connector. because of the unintended use of this cable, it will creep out of place in a week or so. question: where can i get a cable or a connector that will snap, screw, or otherwise secure the cable/connector in place. does such a component exist?
example at  i rarely deploy something so heavy duty but these are out there if you search for them. today we just make our own when needed. bob
that is quite intense and a little too bulky. i am thinking of painting a small amount of glue across the top (the keyed part and the hole that the key fits into) similar to glue that is used to lock screws in place, but with a little force will let go. does anyone know of a glue/pint that will bond non-permanently in this way?
we used tie wraps and hot glue to hold it together. i didn't mention such because i got the impression you wanted something commercially made. bob
the connector is mounted to a circuit board. describe how you used zip ties...? the hot glue makes sence though; hot glue could be used all around it, and it's certainly not permanent. that might be my solution.
this is where you use your imagination. if you can't use tie wraps, then don't use them. here's what i think a tie wrap is -&gt;
