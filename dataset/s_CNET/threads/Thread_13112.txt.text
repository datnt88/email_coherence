i carried the printer to a new location and it stopped printing. it's not out of toner but just won't print. help.
did you mean to a different computer??
no, same computer, brother said try test page while it's not connected to the computer and it printed. but then when i connect it (ucb) to the computer it doesn't see it. but hit print and a page comes out blank.tried different ucb port, reinstalling; any other suggestions?
by reinstalling, i am assuming that you mean that you reloaded the software disk that came with the printer. does any other usb device work, say a flash drive? does the printer show up in control panel under printers? there are a few things we need to know.
no, the printer does not show up in printers. yes, the usb plug works for other devices, my mp3 player is recognized and usable. but the printer is not recognized when i plug it in to the usb. i have removed and reinstalled the software but the program says it can't find the printer. maybe my usb printer cable is bad. just a guess, i'm not much of a geek.
