how can you tell which motherboard or cpu would be compatible with xp when building a system for the first time.
is check their web site for the board and drivers listed for it. drivers will specify what os they are for. it's a good bet that, if any are for xp, the whole board is xp compatible.
imho, most new mtrbds. now being offered are still going to be xp compatible. the cpu will follow with the mtrbd. its going to be a problem roughly in another 2-3 yrs. yet. while you can certainly still make a xp based system, the current os is vista which will be supplanted by win7. don't get too stuck on xp, because if you have upgrade later or move on beause of s/w issues, then your then current xp system may not be all that ready to do so. regardless, as the other poster offered, visit the mtrbd. support website for availability of xp drivers and such as this is a telling sign of support now and hopefully later. tada -----willy
