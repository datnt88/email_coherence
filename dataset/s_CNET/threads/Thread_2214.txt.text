i've got a dell dm051 series computer that was working fine till it started re-starting by itself and giving the following error message: &quot;alert! previous attempts at booting this system have failed at checkpoint [ithr].for help in resolving this problem, please note this check point and contact dell technical support.&quot; this is how i tried to solve the problem: 1) unplugged all usb devices and any other devices except the monitor. 2) entered cmos & disabled &quot;boot from usb&quot;. 3) cleared cmos by removing the battery & moving the &quot;clear cmos&quot; jumper. i did not add any new device to the pc!!! what else can i try? please help.
i can't tell how old and if you as a pc tech did the usual inspection for bad caps (see google) as well as the usual cleaning and fan checks. bob
on top of what robert offered to do, you should start looking at a replacement or swap it out, the psu. provided a direct replacement or one that can work for the time being, see if that makes any improvements. besides heat stress, a weak or poor psu can cause restarts. however, you can stop restarts as that is a bios action upon any failure. in order to stop the re-looping of restarts, do that check the bios and &quot;disable that option&quot;. tada -----willy
so it doesn't give you enough time to attempt booting into safe mode? what os??
so you did what was suggested and contacted dell technical support to help you resolve the problem? what did they say when you told them about the [ithr] error? or didn't you yet? why not? kees
e-mailed dell. still waiting for an answer/solution.
