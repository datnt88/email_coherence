<s> i am trying to connect my creative zen vision m to my laptop, but it is not working.  </s>
<s> i believe the problem may be with the usb ports, but i have tried everything i can think of to fix it. the only other option i have left is to buy a powered usb hub.  </s>
<s> does anyone have any ideas?  </s>
<s> i am using a dell inspiron 8600 and windows xp. the usb ports are 2.0.  </s>
<s> come with any software or drivers?  </s>
<s> yes. i installed everything that was on the cd. i have been thinking that the usb ports are underpowered, but i have changed some of their settings and still cannot get the device recognized.  </s>
<s> i don't know if you are still having this problem, b/c your post is old, but i had the same problem with my creative zen micro.  </s>
<s> i don't think it is your usb ports - i had the problem on my dell and then on my toshieba tecra - where i plug in my device but the zen software does not see it - but napster sees it.  </s>
<s> with some (or perhaps all and i never noticed) usb drivers, you have to use the same port that you used when you installed the device.  </s>
<s> but i think your problem is just a creative problem.  </s>
<s> i don't have the problem with other mp3 players that i have (iriver) and i dont' have it with other usb devices i use on my laptop.  </s>
