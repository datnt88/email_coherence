13437	4	240902	2446824	2446806	vapcmd	3/31/07 6:36 pm	1.17536616e12	ok...if you have an idea tell us what it is.	ps....no such thing as 'dual channel memory'. but there is memory that operates in the motherboard's dual memory architecture and for best results it takes matched pairs. to avoid the ram from going from 400mhz to 333mhz...get 2 dimms @1gb each and place them in the first dual channel dimm slots. test the new dimms thoroughly with memtest86+. if they test ok....then add the 2 @ 512mbs and see how it runs... be prepared to obeserve the impact and tradeoff of the ram speed reduction and the extra 1gb ram. then make your decision what to do the 2-512s. vapcmd

(see your mobo/pc manual to identify which bank a slot is part of.) if 2gb is your goal, that's probably the best way to go since all 3 sticks will be running at full ddr-400 speed.
