i have recently aquired a micronpc piii mb (mbd00-1136). the mnual at buympc's website does not have the front panel lights/switch positions listed. i get the mb to power on, but when i try to install any windows(98,me or xp), it will restart during install, usually at the same place. this is not an overheating problem, as i can let the mb run diags for hours with no problems. i believe the problem to be the fp switch connections on the mb. does anyone know the proper switch positions for this mb or where i can find a more complete manual for it. all help is greatly appreciated.
clear the cmos and accept the defaults and keep it in the most basic mode. review those setting and only tweak to reflect what you have, like cds, etc. and then proceed to save it. the frt. panel shouldn't make bit of difference, you can unplug them all expect for power and proceed with your ps install. if it still fails, you may have a bad cpu/ram or other componet. under xp install try the compatibility mode and see what the results are before any install. you may have encountered what the micronpc was casuing a problem for the orginal owner??? good luck -----willy
to add try a different cd device. have seen cd's stop working as internal temperatues increased. bill
