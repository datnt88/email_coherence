<s> my computer currently has two hard drives; 8mb (master) & 2mb (slave).  </s>
<s> i removed the 2mb drive and tried to install a new 13.6mb drive.  </s>
<s> i plugged the ide cable labeled &quot;slave&quot; and the power cable into my new hard drive, and when i turned on my computer it failed to boot. it says it cannot detect a master drive.  </s>
<s> what happened?  </s>
<s> i never even touched the master hard drive!  </s>
<s> p.s. i'm running windows xp.  </s>
<s> have you set the jumper on the drive to slave?  </s>
<s> check the jumpers on the 13.6 hard drive to verify that it is set to slave.  </s>
<s> usually the hard drive casing will have instructions etched or labeled as to the correct setting for the jumpers.  </s>
