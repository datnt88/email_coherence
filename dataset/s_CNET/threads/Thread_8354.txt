1404	6	238259	2431080	2429876	flyingflea	3/15/07 8:25 am	1.1739471e12	sorry for fibbing on the details!	i had a look at the article and tried googling evdo router but i don't wish to purchase further equipment if possible. if i understand the article correctly, it is showing how to make a 802.11b wireless card act as a wireless router. now that could possibly work, however, i would much prefer the desktop had a wired connection to the 8-port switch and got the internet access from there. i did try installing a wireless usb device to the desktop but for some reason it didn't pick up a wireless network. yet when i installed netstumbler it did detect a strong encrypted wireless network. so if someone can figure out how to fix that then maybe i can make the sierra wireless aircard 875 act as a wireless router work?
