i was thinking about buying a lcd monitor and i found one that was on sale. but i don't know if it's good in performance, so anyone tell me if this is a good monitor in performance.
on a benchmark, i doubt if this monitor will score well. but lots of popular monitors flunk benchmarks (especially nec and sony). with that said, go look at the monitor and decide for yourself. ask them to run it at its native resolution (1280x1024) with stuff that you'll be using. (ask them to connect it to a laptop if necessary.) if you plan on watching movies, get them to play a dvd; if you do a lot of excel/word, open those applications; if you play games, fire up a quake4 demo. now do these same tests with a more expensive monitor (samsungs lcds are regarded as top notch) and decide if the differences are with the extra money.
i bought the 17inch one and am very happy with it. i also in fact considered the 19-inch because it has dvi (digital) support and is two inches bigger, but it was also alot more money. if you are preared to pay for that, i say go for it!
