7377	0	192234	2079200	nr	mac_simon	7/19/06 9:13 am	1.15330038e12	switching router manufacturers	i just purchased a dell laptop that came with a free 802.11g netgear router. i currently have a linksys 802.11b router with one wired desktop (windows 2000), 2 wireless desktops (one running xp - one 2000) and three laptops (xp). my question is .. do i need to get two netgear usb adapters to replace the linksys adapters or will they work with the new router( at the slower speed). i figured i would ask before i start ripping everything apart and have no internet in the house. thanks for any assistance jim
