<s> kids shot the screen wit a bb gun (:-( and damaged it.  </s>
<s> where can i procure the screen component for replacement.  </s>
<s> i am an electronic tech of 30 years but i do not know of a source for this.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> thank you, mike crosby  </s>
<s> somewhere in that huge company they must have spares and a distribution mechanism for them.  </s>
<s> but it seems very well possible to me that the price of a spare screen for a unit that was sold from 2004 is much more than the current price of a comparable unit.  </s>
<s> better check before you order.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> you may be right, but it is worth a shot.  </s>
<s> thanks, mike  </s>
<s> depending on how old the lcd is, finding spares is out there in the &quot;used/spares&quot; vendors market.  </s>
<s> google for model# and see if so-so has anything and of course the full cost.  </s>
<s> if the lcd is real old and/or at least 3yrs.  </s>
<s> old, i would consider it a lost unless you really got to have it.  </s>
<s> in most cases a lcd subassy.(alone) or if used, maybe the whole assy. the cost varies.  </s>
<s> buying a new 19in.  </s>
<s> lcd, especially now during this xmas time, there has to be a decent deal out there, well worth the checking out.  </s>
<s> of course, there is ebay too just find a f1903 out there.  </s>
<s> btw, the hp f1503 and f1903 were part of a bad series of lcds that had poor componets used and caused failure.  </s>
<s> so, the parts got used/repaired often and/or these bad lcds were sold, so verify it is a working model component/lcd.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
