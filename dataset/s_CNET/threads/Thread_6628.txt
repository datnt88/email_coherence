(which i surfaced scanned and all)... but my fren didn't want it, so i took it... it's basically free!!! i will be using it only for paging file and temp folder for my other softwares (like audition, photoshop... kaza, limeware...etc) now... is there any software, that can further check, or help in bad clusters? till now... it has only, 5 bad clusters... help !!! please... gsoul2soul
