i have a question. i am thinking of getting a new ssd drive and windows 7, and using my old hard drive for extra storage. do i need to reformat it before using it as a second drive, or can it be plugged in after the new install with files and the old operating system still on it?
yep.
great, that will make it a lot easier to reformat.
