<s> my old battery back-up/surge protector just went dead.  </s>
<s> i am debating on buying a new one.  </s>
<s> is it worth it?  </s>
<s> i am using a separate surge protector now.  </s>
<s> thanks, chuck c.  </s>
<s> while you can live with just a surge protector, battery backups aren't that much more expensive and give better protection which likely extends the life of your computer.  </s>
<s> sometimes things happen to your house current that cause lights to flicker or blink off and back on.  </s>
<s> surge protectors can't provide continuous regulated power during these whereas battery backups can and do.  </s>
<s> sometimes these momentary outages can be long enough to cause your computer to power off abruptly, risking damage to your data unless you have a battery backup.  </s>
<s> most battery backups have a usb connection which can do an orderly shutdown in case a power outage lasts longer than a few minutes.  </s>
<s> this is why i use them.  </s>
<s> your usage determines what's best for you.  </s>
<s> having a battery back-up is added insurance should the time required for its use.  </s>
<s> some areas are more prone to power loss or glitches, so if you feel otherwise, you determine the need.  </s>
<s> overall, i don't see this as a real expensive purchase when compared should the *need* arise, it may can be money well spent.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> which anomaly is a concern?  </s>
<s> for example, how often do incandescent bulbs dim to less than 40% intensity?  </s>
<s> never?  </s>
<s> then ac power remains ideal perfect for all computers.  </s>
<s> why does a computer need a battery backup?  </s>
<s> if voltage is dropping to near zero, then clocks on vcrs and microwave ovens (that are far more sensitive) must be repeatedly reset.  </s>
<s> if not, then your battery backup never did anything useful because ac power is ideal perfect.  </s>
<s> battery backup is temporary and 'dirty' power.  </s>
<s> so that unsaved data can be saved to disk. it protects data; not hardware.  </s>
<s> another function is surge protection.  </s>
<s> not near zero voltage.  </s>
<s> that is protection from a destructive current.  </s>
<s> how often are dimmer switches, digital clocks, and gfcis replaced?  </s>
<s> if surges exist, then all appliances are at risk or have been repeatedly replaced.  </s>
<s> meanwhile read surge protection spec number for that battery backup.  </s>
<s> how many hundred joules?  </s>
<s> destructive surges are hundreds of thousands of joules.  </s>
<s> at near zero joules, what has battery backup done?  </s>
<s> again, temporary and 'dirty' power during a blackout.  </s>
<s> two anomalies are discussed.  </s>
<s> the first is temporary and 'dirty' power so that unsaved data is not lost. the second is a surge that can damage hardware.  </s>
<s> a destructive surge is maybe hundreds of thousands of joules.  </s>
<s> a rare and destructive anomaly that is solved where wires enter the building.  </s>
<s> using a solution that costs significantly less money.  </s>
<s> how often are a dishwasher, furnace, cfl light bulbs, and smoke detectors replaced due to surge damage?  </s>
<s> which anomaly is a concern?  </s>
<s> i guess i will buy the same one that most of our company computers have where i work......the eaton 3s550 ups 550va.  </s>
<s> they're around $70.00.  </s>
