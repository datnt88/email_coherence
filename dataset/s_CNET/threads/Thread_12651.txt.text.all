<s> i rececently purchased a wireless network adaptor, while i am waiting for my router to come in the mail.  </s>
<s> but for some reason i have internet connection in my apartment.  </s>
<s> i guess i might have connected to someone elses netowork or maybe a &quot;hot spot&quot;.  </s>
<s> now while i am using this network, which is not mine, can other people steal file from me?  </s>
<s> your wifi and the internet is a &quot;network&quot; so your request fails on the gitgo.  </s>
<s> however, we often turn on wep, wpa and even mac filtering to harden the home network.  </s>
<s> in answer to &quot;can other people steal file from me?&quot; the answer is very likely.  </s>
<s> do a little research about the evil twin problem of wifi hotspots and you quickly learn to distrust unknown spots.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> so what you are trying to say is that i shouldn't connect to other netowrks or wifi because they can hack into my computer?  </s>
<s> if you are on an unknown network, who's to say what is leaking?  </s>
