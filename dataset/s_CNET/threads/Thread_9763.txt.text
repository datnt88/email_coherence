i'm running xp home sp2 on sony vaio pcv rs-712 with sony dvd cd rewritable drive (model dw-d22a) and hitachi-lg dvd-rom drive (model gdr-8163b (syao). the two drives stopped detecting inserted discs at the same time. i've tried the &quot;troubleshooting&quot; help with no success. device manager states everything is o.k. i can't use the disc cleaner as the discs don't spin. i've tried every kind of disc i have with no success. i opened the drives to clean the lenses but couldn't see anything that looked like a lens. i used a lot of compressed air in any opening there was. still no success. i checked for firmware updates - but i have the latest. i tried the windows driver update, but was told i had the best driver. could there be a registry setting that's wrong? what other things could i try? an old-timer trying to keep up.
if so, what. sometimes these programs will kill a drive.
yes, i had ashampoo burning studio 8 but i uninstalled it but this didn't make any difference.
it does what it says it does at
thanks for the tip. i downloaded the wizard and received the following message for both drives: &quot;either the device is malfunctioning or the wizard cannot determine the problem.&quot; i guess it's not an either/or, but both. here is the log file that was generated. perhaps it has some clues. thanks, autofix [v5.2.3790.67] time [2008-11-05 22:52:50] microsoft windows version [5.1 (service pack 2) &lt;2600&gt;] test [the shell hardware detection service is running.] - instance [n/a]: result [autostart setting]: ok result [the shell hardware detection service is running.]: ok test [policies] - instance [d:\, drive type: 5]: result [hkcu\...\policies!nodrives]: ok {present} result [hkcu\...\policies!nodriveautorun]: ok {absent} result [hkcu\...\policies!nodrivetypeautorun]: ok {present} result [hklm\...\policies!nodrives]: ok {absent} result [hklm\...\policies!nodriveautorun]: ok {absent} result [hklm\...\policies!nodrivetypeautorun]: ok {absent} result [driver level policies]: ok { hklm\...\services\cdrom!autorun (present) &lt;allows&gt; hklm\...\services\cdrom\parameters!autorun (absent) &lt;allows&gt; hklm\system\ccs\enum\...!alwaysenable (absent) &lt;not set&gt; hklm\system\ccs\enum\...!alwaysdisable (absent) &lt;not set&gt; } test [drive notification] - instance [d:\, drive type: 5]: result [legacy notification]: problems result [autoplay v2 notification]: problems { service (silent) shell (deaf) } &gt;&gt; repair &lt;&lt; [legacy autoplay event] step: no steps to take. result: this autoplay setting cannot be fixed. either the device is malfunctioning, or the wizard cannot determine the problem. &gt;&gt; repair &lt;&lt; [autoplay v2 event] step: no steps to take. result: this autoplay setting cannot be fixed. either the device is malfunctioning, or the wizard cannot determine the problem. &gt;&gt; required action: the wizard found problems but cannot fix them -&gt; none autofix [v5.2.3790.67] time [2008-11-05 23:00:21] microsoft windows version [5.1 (service pack 2) &lt;2600&gt;] test [the shell hardware detection service is running.] - instance [n/a]: result [autostart setting]: ok result [the shell hardware detection service is running.]: ok test [policies] - instance [e:\, drive type: 5]: result [hkcu\...\policies!nodrives]: ok {present} result [hkcu\...\policies!nodriveautorun]: ok {absent} result [hkcu\...\policies!nodrivetypeautorun]: ok {present} result [hklm\...\policies!nodrives]: ok {absent} result [hklm\...\policies!nodriveautorun]: ok {absent} result [hklm\...\policies!nodrivetypeautorun]: ok {absent} result [driver level policies]: ok { hklm\...\services\cdrom!autorun (present) &lt;allows&gt; hklm\...\services\cdrom\parameters!autorun (absent) &lt;allows&gt; hklm\system\ccs\enum\...!alwaysenable (absent) &lt;not set&gt; hklm\system\ccs\enum\...!alwaysdisable (absent) &lt;not set&gt; } test [drive notification] - instance [e:\, drive type: 5]: result [legacy notification]: problems result [autoplay v2 notification]: problems { service (silent) shell (deaf) } &gt;&gt; repair &lt;&lt; [legacy autoplay event] step: no steps to take. result: this autoplay setting cannot be fixed. either the device is malfunctioning, or the wizard cannot determine the problem. &gt;&gt; repair &lt;&lt; [autoplay v2 event] step: no steps to take. result: this autoplay setting cannot be fixed. either the device is malfunctioning, or the wizard cannot determine the problem. &gt;&gt; required action: the wizard found problems but cannot fix them -&gt; none
r. proffitt - i think i clicked on the wrong &quot;reply&quot; link and my response to your suggestion is shown above your reply. i appreciate your patience and your reward will be in heaven.
see how another solved it at
thanks for the lead. i had already uninstalled a previous burner (only files i found still around were log files). no new driver updates available. autofix still doesn't help. i'm becoming very concerned - nothing seems to help and i don't even want to consider new drives as i don't think two drives would mechanically fail at the same time. i'm trying to be hopeful that there's still something i can do to correct the problem. any other suggestions? - i'll try anything.
1. tried one drive at a time. 2. removed the usual upper and lower filters (read  ) 3. booted safe mode and headed to the device manager to delete all cd/dvd drives there then rebooted. 4. noted if the bios sees the drives. remember if the bios doesn't find them, neither will windows.
i appreciate you sticking with me on this. i tried items 1, 3, & 4 with no success. i didn't attempt 2 because of the warning: &quot;uninstall all cd or dvd writing or recording programs&quot; before using this method. i have a writing program that was pre-installed on my computer with the os (program called click to dvd). if i delete it i don't know how to re-install as i don't have any install discs. at any rate, i see that this procedure is for resolving the error if the drive is missing from my computer, but shows in device manager with a conflict. this isn't my problem. the drives are shown in my computer and there is no conflict shown in device manager. am i running out of options?
as to removing the software items i've ignored that and found the only loss was something that didn't work well. good luck, bob
bob, thanks for all your help. unfortunately for us novices, &quot;something that [doesn't] work well&quot; is more than an &quot;only loss.&quot; i guess it's because we often don't know how to correct something that's not working well (the difference between &quot;not working well&quot; and &quot;not working&quot; is blurred. i hope you know how much your work is appreciated on this forum. i've learned a lot in the process. thanks again. i'll report back on any success i get (it might be of value for others in the same boat.)
