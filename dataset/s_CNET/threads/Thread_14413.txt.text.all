<s> i've set up a home network using my work laptop, called mshome.  </s>
<s> i can see the other machine in microsoft windows network both ways - between pc and laptop.  </s>
<s> when i try to open the machine, i have to log on.  </s>
<s> the pc is called orangeroom and the laptop is laptop28.  </s>
<s> my log on username for both machines is &quot;cool&quot;.  </s>
<s> when i try to log on to the laptop through the network, by typing in &quot;cool&quot; with a password, it changes to orangeroom/cool but won't log on.  </s>
<s> when i try to log onto the pc from the laptop, i again have to log on and i get an error message: the username you typed in is the same as the user name you logged on with.  </s>
<s> that user name has already been tried.  </s>
<s> a domain controller cannot be found to verify that user name.  </s>
<s> i'm running xp pro sp2 and would really appreciate some help!  </s>
<s> any firewalls running?  </s>

<s> when i click my network places, i can see my school network &quot;chschool&quot; and &quot;mshome&quot; - my home network.  </s>
<s> it's a built in limitation of the xp home os. you need xp pro to interact with most work networks since they have a domain login requirement.  </s>
<s> your it should help you with this. also worth noting is that a vpn connection will have restrictions to what shares you can connect to.  </s>
<s> this is by design!  </s>
