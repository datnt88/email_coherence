15221	2	526119	5128119	5128104	funkmama	5/7/11 5:16 pm	1.30478856e12	wow thanks!	oh wow! thank you so much! that is exactly the kind of site i was looking for earlier, and your recommendation looks really good thank you so much! just one question, are graphics cards uniform? will any card fit in any machine? or are there some cards that i just can't use?
15221	3	526119	5128131	5128119	funkmama	5/7/11 5:19 pm	1.30478874e12	sorry for the double post	sorry, i can't seem to locate the edit button tell me, where would i buy a graphics card online? and how would i know i was buying the right one? a quick search there of radeon hd 5570 turned up...  that for one thing. where should i buy the card from, if i was purchasing one?
15221	4	526119	5128152	5128104	funkmama	5/7/11 6:57 pm	1.30479462e12	300 watts	i know i am triple posting but i can't see any sort of edit button. maybe a mod can merge all these posts? please d: anyway, i hazarded opening up my computer... carefully... and discovered that my power supply is 300 watts. i think my cpu uses about 105 watts, so that should leave me with the option of a graphics card of 150 watts or so? with 50 watts left over for safety. what would you recommend?
15221	5	526119	5128239	5128152	bob b	5/8/11 8:07 am	1.30484202e12	watts	the 300w psu is the limiter.......which is why i chose a card with close to the same watts as the 8500. with that psu i would not fit a video card that is much over 50w. where to shop? i like newegg.  amazon is fine. there are other places.......go shopping.
15221	6	526119	5128249	5128239	funkmama	5/8/11 9:20 am	1.3048464e12	thanks!	i decided to go with this card  there is a watt difference but i'm pretty sure my psu can handle it. you were really helpful, and your website was invaluable thank you!

15221	10	526119	5194058	5193948	funkmama	8/28/11 4:17 pm	1.31454822e12	nice necro	you are so late to the party :p i've been using it since i posted that i had it installed. i don't have very high graphical demands, just that i can run everything with some decency. mass effect/dragon age are both wonderfully smooth, and even moderate graphic hogging games like tropico 3 are fine. portal 2/fallout 3/new vegas/oblivion all run like a dream. even f.e.a.r. manages to be smooth on the card... just about :p so in regards to the cards performance, it works fine. now the above isn't with everything maxed, i generally avoid v-sync/aa to pump the max out of shadows/textures. if i were doing it again, i'd probably shoot for an nvidia card honestly. not because the ati card isn't great... it's quiet and does everything wonderfully. but due to nvidia's &quot;the way it's meant to be played&quot; campaign, a lot of games run better on nvidia cards than ati cards. an example would be borderlands. your ati card would need to be twice as good as an nvidia card, just to be comparable graphically. mind you, i haven't found any other game as bad as that and nvidia cards generally need a lot more power. and i am not upgrading my power supply :p so, in summary, yes the card is good. buy one. they work. even on terrible power supplies like mine. tl;dr: read the tiny paragraph above this.
