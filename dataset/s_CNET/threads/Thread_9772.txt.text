anyone know if there's any pc with the new amd apu trinity a series?
i read there are demo units out there but what happens next is well known. are you aware how this works? what happens next? bob
i saw some good review on it so it caught my attention.  i read around the apu a10, and yesterday i been searching around for computer and i have found this one called arctic mc101 having the a10. looking good and the other feature are matching to what i m looking for...i might go for that... bob, what you mean when you say what happens next ?
i see tomshardware did check it out but again, can't find any compelling reason over other solutions. but, there are folk that want the latest. they'll ask when the iphone 5 will be out but as soon as that shows up, they will hold off and ask when the iphone 6 will arrive. bob
hi , i am planning to buy a pc with latest processor, is this latest from amd? how about intel?
if the amd trinity as you said is the latest processor, the mc101 you mentioned, do they have barebone coz i want to add my own storage or os?
@sjones0000 _ yes they have barebone version, much cheaper than the full version. i have brought the mc101 from arctic at the end, i got the full version with trinity a10, it's excellent and i love it. working great and its really small and good looking, fit in my living.
