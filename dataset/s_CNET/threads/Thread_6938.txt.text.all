<s> it'll go black and my monitor seems to reset and displace text and images when it reappears.  </s>
<s> i use windows xp. i don't know if this is a hardware problem, but it really annoys me.  </s>
<s> has anyone seen this before?  </s>

<s> you get to face the possibility that the os may be reinstalled.  </s>
<s> before that, have your xp cd handy and run... sfc /scannow if it still fails after a reboot, then research your video card make/model, go download and install the latest drivers, install, reboot and retest.  </s>
<s> best of luck, bob  </s>
