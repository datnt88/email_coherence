i wrote the following in another forum, but i believe i've posted in the wrong one. i do hope someone can help. i'm new to the forums, but have posted two questions in the past and received some excellent (and i might add, ever so grateful) advice-help. well it seems i'm in need of advice once again. i need to purchase a video card, but my head is spinning from a weird mass of terminology! i do know and understand that it must be agp. now my motherboard manual (asus p3b-f) states that &quot;agp bus frequencies above 66mhz exceed the specifications for the agp interface and are not guaranteed to be stable&quot; i only need a basic, low cost card. so the one i'm looking into is as follows. would this be a compatible card? pine sis 315e video card / 32mb / agp 4x performance gpu/vpu sis 315e ramdac 375 mhz maximum resolution learn more 2048 x 1536 @ 85hz memory video memory 32mb memory type sdram core clock 166 mhz memory clock 143 mhz memory bandwidth 2.7gb/sec. connections interface type agp interface speed 4x connector(s) vga system requirements operating systems linux windows 2000 windows 95 windows 98 windows me windows nt windows xp
without knowing anything about the motherboard (tried digging up some info but no luck). assumed this mb has a agp slot, i would think this video board should be ok. agp 4x should be backward compatible.
you didn't mention the price for the card you listed. be good to know. nowdays there might be a good 64mb card around for the same price. good luck. chuck
