i am running windows xp professional on an asus p4t motherboard with 2gb rdram and 1.8 mhz pentium 4 processor. my sound card is a creative audigy live. my graphics card is an ati all in wonder 7500. i have downloaded all the latest drivers and updates for all my hardware and the operating system here is my problem and it is driving me crazy!!! when i play the tv on the computer the video and sound are out of sink (the sound and video play at different times like a poorly dubbed karate movie). the graphics card uses the sound cards input to play sound through a cable connecting both cards. another weird thing is that my system keeps muting the input volume by itself as though resetting itself. i hope it is just a configuration issue but i am clueless.
i'm assuming this is recorded tv. if so, the mpeg recording could be overtaxing your cpu. unfortunately, the all in wonder series is discontinued. if you're using it for tv tuning/recording, you should dial back it recording quality. if you have a seperate tv tuner, a new video card with hardware assisted mpeg playback could help. look for a radeon x1000 or geforce 7000/8000 series video card.
actually it is live tv that does this, weird huh. i got rid of xp and went back to 2000 and everything works fine now so i guess i am just stuck with an older operating system.
