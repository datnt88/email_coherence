the sound coming from my speakers is distorted. is the sound card causing this problem?
more info... has anything changed recently, new install, s/w or h/w or maybe you reboot improperly. alot can happen to cause bad audio. please check your system resources to see what is available as audio is realtime function, too much going on can play havoc with audio. good luck -----willy
is the distortion from like the sound being clipped or soemthing else. if it's being clipped depending on what sound software came with your card maybe look at the eq settings. high bass and high volume will make the speakers begin to clip and distort. if you can turn the volume down and it cleans up amplify the sound anther way.
