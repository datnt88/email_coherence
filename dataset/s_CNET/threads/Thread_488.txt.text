i bought a brand new seagate freeagent 500gb usb desktop external hard drive from compusa (on sale for $120 + tax). i plan to use it on an older laptop running xp and hopefully a new pc (haven't bought yet) running vista. my question is: how can i get a bunch of data off an old pc running windows me ? the machine recognizes the device as a usb disk; but it is not available to browse in my computer. thanks in advance, s
the really new versions require zero linux skill and write to most usb drives. bob
i think you are suggesting i use linux to move my files; but... any other ideas?
...the 9x/me drivers for the external drive in place ? then- apart from linux or dos, or an os on a cd, there is &quot; slave &quot;.
you boot a cd, some windows show up with drive letters and files and you copy them as you learned in windows. now, what linux skill did that involve? read  bob
