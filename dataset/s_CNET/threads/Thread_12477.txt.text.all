<s> i recently received two, ecs goal3+ mobo w/cpu (amd sempron 3000+).  </s>
<s> i set them up following step by step procedure for bench checking... the first mobo works fine. the second, the cpu fan starts but nothing else.  </s>
<s> i used the same power supply, memory, keyboard, monitor, and mouse in each mobo.  </s>
<s> why did the second fail to function correctly? is it a bad cpu? or could the cmos battery be bad on the second mobo?  </s>
<s> this has to be done in order to be nothing is amiss.  </s>
<s> small things can be forgotten or taken for granted.  </s>
<s> i would under these circumstances return the bad one and just leave it at that. the longer you play with it may cause further problem(s), then they can blame you.  </s>
<s> use the warranty and state one works and the other doesn't under the same test bed.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> after disassembly, i reassembled and rechecked the second mobo.  </s>
<s> when it still failed, i then, rechecked the first mobo with same items and it still works... thanks, for your help.  </s>
<s> i will get it returned... i'd still like to know why it failed... do you know?  </s>
<s> or is it more testing required?  </s>
<s> (i am not a techie.  </s>
<s> i just follow instructions well.) thanks for your help...  </s>
<s> i can't say for sure as at this level its more of a close inspection type of thing.  </s>
<s> i check the solder runs, and shorts or bent points, broken contacts, etc., that could be at fault.  </s>
<s> you could swap the bios(if socketed) and see if that helps.  </s>
<s> sometimes, it just so.  </s>
<s> maybe s/h damage or the bios needs an update, etc., some jumper or setting isn't right.  </s>
<s> poor soldering or similar.  </s>
<s> maybe a blown capacitor already, or even worse an outdated version/rev.  </s>
<s> wasn't done from the factory, then look at the stickers/decals and/or silk-screened info.  </s>
<s> really, its out of your hands as very possibility you couldn't fix it and would you want to as warranty comes into play.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> your recent input was most helpful... thanks a million... the mobo is on its way back... have a great day willy.  </s>
