<s> i work from home taking inbound calls for a satellite tv provider and we are now transitioning to a different type of system and there are new pc requirements that my current pc no longer meets.  </s>
<s> can someone please give me a good suggestion on what make and model desktop or laptop i can get that meets these requirements, p.s i'm looking for the absolute cheapest option and i live i oklahoma city, ok i am willing to buy online and would appreciate any suggestions on legitimate financing options &#8226;  </s>
<s> my son got this asus k55n ds81 that was all of 380 bucks and appears to exceed those requirements.  </s>
<s> was there some other requirement that something like this won't do?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> im not adverse to a laptop i will take whatever is cheapest.  </s>
<s> i lokked @ the suggestion you made but the processor on it is 1.9ghz and i need 3.0ghz processer speed i have been looking on qvc and hsn because they have flex pay options and i am not trying to spend a small fortune all at one time being as though this was unexpected but it seems that the only ones that meet those spec are $800 and up.  </s>
<s> i would appreciateay other infoyou can find.  </s>
<s> there are thousands of web pages that detail how cpus have advanced and how this 1.9ghz is far faster than the p4 ghz.  </s>
<s> i fear that you need to talk to folk in the stores about this.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i suspect you could go to wally-mart or the like and get the cheapest desktop on the shelf and it would exceed the specs you listed.  </s>
<s> 350/450 buck range.  </s>
<s> just an example and not a recco.  </s>
