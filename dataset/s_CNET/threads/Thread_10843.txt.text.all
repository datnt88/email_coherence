<s> hi, i have a dell dimension 4700 that has all stock parts and windows xp home edition 32bit.  </s>
<s> it is a mid tower case and i am looking to upgrade it as i want to play newer games without getting another computer.  </s>
<s> i was wondering if someone could help me pick out certain parts for it that are both compatible with it and will fit in my case.  </s>
<s> i am looking to upgrade the power supply to at least 500 watts, get a new motherboard that supports intel core 2 duo, 4 expansion slots for memory and can support pci express x16 and 2.0.  </s>
<s> also i want to get a good cpu that can either be overclocked or that is good for gaming (crysis).  </s>
<s> i know im asking for a lot but i am new to the whole upgrading thing.  </s>
<s> the operating system from dell could be locked to the old board so budget for a new os as well.  </s>
<s> the video card list i use is at bob  </s>
<s> basically, you're upgrading everything but the case, so really what are you saving to re-use?  </s>
<s> effectively, just get a diy setup and proceed.  </s>
<s> if you plan to keep the oem xp-os, most just won't work outside of they're original system.  </s>
<s> so, look at emachine or similar for details of basic newer system and go from there.  </s>
<s> gamer websites should provide what really works for any particular games.  </s>
<s> basic &quot;bare bones&quot; system that have a mtrbd, cpu and some ram but nothing else are also out there, check online vendors like geeks, newegg and tigerdirect for such, but there are lots out there.  </s>
<s> take my advice don't skimp on a decent psu, besides wattage and cooling for same.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
