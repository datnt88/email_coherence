i have a linksys wireless-b notebook adapter (2.4 ghz/802.11b)for my dell inspiron 4100 computer. it is probably 2 years old (the adapter). the router is a linksys, too, and is about the same age. i often have a lot of difficulty connecting to the internet through this computer. right now, for instance, it shows connectivity very low and cannot find new ip address (repair). should i buy a newer adapter - i.e. do adapters wear out or go bad? we have another laptop with an internal adaptor which connects just fine.
adapters do not generally wear out (although there is the occasional case...think blue smoke of death) what does happen more often is they become outdated, just like any technology. if you are working with 802.11b, i would upgrade to a b/g compatible adapater asap. most wireless networks nowadays are running the faster, more capable 54g standard, and a $30-50 pcmcia card is the only thing separating you from the glory of high(er) speed wireless access. do remember, however, that the internet connection, not the lan, will be the bottleneck in your case, as it is with virtually every network today. but you can still benefit from the extended range and increased lan throughput that comes from 802.11g.
you should try updating the wireless-b notebook adapter. think about it: you probably have updated your windows operating system more than 10 times over the past 2 years (via windows update). when was the last time you updated the driver for your wireless adapter? for example, if you have a linksys wpc11 wireless-b notebook adapter, the latest driver was released on 12-feb-2004. check out  also, see if there is a firmware update to download and install on your router. just to add to what ''pigonthewing'' wrote, another advantage of g over b is better wireless security.
