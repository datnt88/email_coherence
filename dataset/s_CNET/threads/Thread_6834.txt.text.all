<s> bob  </s>
<s> sorry but as you might have figured by now, this is not exactly my field.  </s>
<s> what do you mean by &quot;average clone desktop&quot;.  </s>
<s> and why do you say that?  </s>
<s> i thought that this one would be fantastic with the huge ram and hdd, processor speed and the supossedly &quot;alright&quot; graphics card (according to some reviews i found) thanks again.  </s>
<s> it's not a company with reviews by the usual sites (such as cnet) and is what you can find at mom and pop pc clone shops all over.  </s>
<s> yes, the parts are there but are you ready to figure out if they forget a driver or some other thing?  </s>
<s> for example many clone shops omit/forget intel's little rapid storage app and the owner suffers needlessly.  </s>
<s> such details are many but you see them all the time. the final choice is yours but i wouldn't buy that.  </s>
<s> if i was going to go down that road i'd copy what another member is doing at this link: that's one nice selection.  </s>
<s> they picked the top from the people's choices.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks mate, i think i will go with the acer now cheers for all the help.  </s>
