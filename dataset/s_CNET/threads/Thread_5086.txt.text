my nook tablet shuts down on me while playing word games. has anyone else had this problem. do you know if this problem is inherent in the tablet?
but yes, when it gets about 2 years old and with folk that use it daily i expect these to need a battery but i can't tell from the information whether this applies or not. bob
my tablet will be 2 yrs. old around feb or mar of 2014. this problem started a few months ago. since i have b&n insurance, i have turned in my original tablet two times for the same tablet with a later manufacturing date. still have the same problem. i do use my tablet on a daily basis. would you suggest going to the newer model of nook or try another manufacturer. i think b&n is leaning toward blaming me with doing something wrong. model #bntv250a, software version 1.4.3.
i know, inconvenient but it's just a test run. then report this to the app's author. android is the new windows. lots of issues still. bob
i can say it might be because of the battery !!! replace you're batter ....
