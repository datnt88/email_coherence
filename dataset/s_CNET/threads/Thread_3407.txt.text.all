<s> i am looking to buy a new computer and i am wondering what are the best desktop vendors out there?  </s>
<s> i currently own a computer from cyberpowerinc (3 years old) which has been a great computer overall but their customer service sucks.  </s>
<s> still, i have still been unable to beat their prices.  </s>
<s> keep in mind, i am not looking to buy a computer that includes windows or a monitor (since some vendors make you purchase windows).  </s>
<s> i am looking in the $500-$600 range.  </s>
<s> as a side question, is it worth it to get a amd 64bit processor now?  </s>
<s> also, any recommendations on the best value brands for motherboards, harddrives, dvd burners, ect.  </s>
<s> are welcome.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> you can build a nice machine for 600 bucks.  </s>
<s> check good amd (non 64) board would be the shuttle an35n ultra good amd proc would be the mobile 2600+ (can easily overclock to 2.5ghz, which is what mine is at now) memory - mushkin about 79 bucks for 512mb (get 2 to run in dual channel mode) hard drive - any brand should do, get at least 80gb dvd burner - i always recommend lite on, but newegg has an 8x optorite for about 48 bucks.  </s>
<s> video card - cheapest i would get is the 9600pro, mid would range from the 5900xt, 9800pro the motherboard i listed has onboard sound which is fine, and onboard ethernet.  </s>
<s> the processor lacks a heatsink/fan, so be sure to get one.  </s>
<s> i have the thermaltake tr2 from compusa for 27 bucks.  </s>
<s> benchmarks show my proc beats a 3ghz p4 ee. i just put the 9600pro into a budget machine for a friend and it ran ut2004 beautifully.  </s>
<s> i have the 5900xt and it runs doom3 on high smoothly.  </s>
<s> there are many places to look.  </s>
<s> newegg.com  </s>
<s> like the other gentleman said but also look at look at the barebone packages and add on from there.  </s>
<s> brand name products are almost double in price for what you get.  </s>
<s> i would wait another year for a 64 bit. the prices will be cut in half.  </s>
<s> skip  </s>
<s> thank you both, i have been looking at newegg already but i will check pricewatch as well.  </s>
<s> mainly the problem isn't knowing what i want but knowing which are the best but cheap brands.  </s>
<s> i know i want an amd, but 32bit vs. 64 bit is in the air.  </s>
<s> motherboards i have no idea about.  </s>
<s> memory, i assume i should get the pc3200 400mhz ddr kind.  </s>
<s> i actually don't need a video card and choosing a harddrive shouldnt be that hard.  </s>
<s> finally, i dont know anything about overclocking and that kind of stuff, but i will check into that &quot;dual channel&quot; mode you mentioned about the ram.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> what software will you run?  </s>
<s> for business software, an athlon xp2600+ would be the best value.  </s>
<s> if you want to run games, multimedia, cad, photoshop, etc. then you should get an athlon 64.  </s>
