i know formatting hdd in the normal standard format c:/ technique can still be recovered; well some files. what programs out there completely deletes everything in a hdd that it is unrecoverable ? recommendations pls.. thanks
look up killdisk on google.com
several years ago i bought wipe drive because i could boot it from a floppy and wipe any hdd to a dod spec. most drive mfgs have utilities that will diagnose their drives or wipe their drives, write zeros to them (wd has this one and so does ibm)), etc., etc., and i'm sure there are others. if i run across any others...i post another note.
