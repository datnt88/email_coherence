does anyone know if it is necessary to press the power button on the samsung syncmaster px2370 monitor, to completely shut it off? if i power down my pc, the monitor goes off/dark on its own. when i restart the pc, the monitor comes on without touching the power button. if i shut off the px2370 before i shut off the pc, the px2370 won't come on again the next time i restart- i have to push the power button. the power switch at the bottom of the screen is the touch sensitive type. is the power completely off or is it using power in the first example? i could find nothing in the manual about this topic. thanks for any info!
the vga connection might let the monitor sleep.
if the monitor turns on when you start the pc then i'll take a guess the monitor is in some sort of standby mode. power usage......about a1/2w. if you want zero power usage......push the off switch.
thanks for the info r.proffitt and bob b!
