i've been thinking about buying a kindle and i have a phone that contains all my music. so, i'm thinking to get something with a hard drive that i can read books and have all my music on. any suggestions?
maybe you are thinking of something where you put your collection in some cloud?
i really want a hard drive, not a flash drive or cloud.
i see ultrabooks with 500gb drives but no tablet yet. but you are seeing what i'm seeing. folk who want what their laptop has, in ipad form and size. bob
exactly, bob! i want something that will last. my phone was really good, for about 2 1/2 years but it's starting to blink out on me.
laptop or notebook or netbook. kees
i guess i should have been more specific. i want an e-reader like a kindle, also i want something i can put my music on and never do it again, like a zune with a hard drive. so, this will cost me about $500 and i have two devices to carry around. is there something out there that will do both? i already have a laptop and a desktop so i don't need to have internet on this new device, i just want to download books and music on this new device and be done with it.
there are tablet form laptops but at 3 to 4 times that price.
