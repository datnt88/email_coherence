(all hp) i sent the hp 3600 back because it would not print on heavy card stock. the salesperson told me that is would when i bought it. i am currently using an hp officejet pro k550 and an hp c6180 all in one. they both print text and graphics on my cards beautifully, but has a tendency to smear...especially on matte card stock. the c6180 will not handle the heavier card stock, but will handle regular card stock. can anyone give me a recommendation?
