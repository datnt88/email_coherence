<s> do not fall for &quot;best&quot; or that &quot;ownyourownmodem&quot; scam.  </s>

<s> bob  </s>
<s> beings you are on the comcast 20/5 it would pay you to get a d3 modem.  </s>
<s> if you are in a d3 area that will give you 4 bonded channels down.  </s>
<s> if your not now in a d3 area, you will be before long.  </s>
<s> your speeds will be more constant with the bonded channels.  </s>
<s> no more of the 6 to midnight slowdowns.  </s>
<s> they are also testing bonded channels on the upload so that will just be a matter of time.  </s>
<s> i use a motorola sb 6120 modem and a netgear wnr 3500l router and that setup works excellent doing the same thing you want to do.  </s>
<s> bestbuy carries both the modem and router.  </s>
<s> i am looking for same.  </s>
<s> i want modem/router combo.  </s>

<s> let me know if you were about to find a unit which has modem and router  </s>
