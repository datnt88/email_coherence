<s> this morning when i turned on my old desktop computer, my acer lcd monitor was displayed nothing. the only thing i can see is the light on the bottom of the lcd keep flashing.  </s>
<s> normally, last time when i pushed the power button i can see the acer logo appeared on the lcd screen but now no more acer logo appear, it just no response.  </s>
<s> my pc can post with a single beep sound and i can heard the melody when my computer enter windows.  </s>
<s> what happen to my computer?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> i can't see in your post you checked the video cable/connection.  </s>
<s> best case it could just be a loose connection, so unplug the video cable and plug it back in, making sure the screws are tightened.  </s>
<s> if that's it, it could be either your monitor has died or your video adapter has.  </s>
<s> if you can plug in another monitor, you can see if it's your video adapter.  </s>
<s> if the adapter is working, that narrows it down to the monitor.  </s>
<s> i have an acer monitor i bought a couple of years ago that has a light below the lower right corner.  </s>
<s> fwiw, when it's not receiving a signal the light is amber, when it is, it's blue.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> based on the acer lcd i'm looking at.  </s>
<s> if i disconnect the monitor from the pc and then power the monitor on i see the acer logo.  </s>
<s> if i use the osd....on screen display buttons i can view and play with stuff.  </s>
<s> if i did not get a logo and the osd did not function i'd take a guess the monitor is &quot;borked&quot;.  </s>
<s> with the monitor disconnected from the pc or the pc turned off.  </s>
<s> i turn the monitor on......i see an acer logo then a no signal message.  </s>
<s> the osd does not function.  </s>
<s> if the osd didn't work, the test told us what to swap out.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
