i have a 566mhz processor. ive tried to burn a dvd but holly it takes a like 18hours. and thats just a 1 gig of video. im guessing not even if i upgrade it wont make a difference. so my question is which comp or kind of computer can help to burn this kind of video.
the actual recording time should be about the same with your cpu and some 2+ ghz cpu. what will change is the encoding time. it's very linear to cpu power. if you had a twice as fast cpu, it would take 1/2 as long. any under 1,000 buck desktop will do this much faster but none (at that price) will break it down in less than say, one hour. bob
yes!!! for example when i first got into video edditing and i would render a 10min video on my 500mhz pc, it would take 40min to complete!!!! now the same video will render on my 3200+ amd64 in about 6 min. john
