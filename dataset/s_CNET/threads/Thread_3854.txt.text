anybody have any experience with or opinions about the netopia 3347nwg-vgx?
seems an odd item compared to what most home owners would consider. bob
i'm a consultant with a home office---if that sheds any light on my preferences. at present i'm using a netopia 3546; no complaints. i want to add 802.11g and dislike having more boxes around than strictly necessary. any recommendations? not necessarily limited to netopia ... what i'd really like is a wireless gateway/router with gigabit ethernet. not that my dsl service needs the humongous bandwidth; i'd just like to network my computers at high speed.
use just put in a wifi router and connected it to out gigabit switch. 2 boxes but cheap, works... bob
