<s> i have two external hard drives that i want to wipe clean (not reformat; wipe clean).  </s>
<s> are the disks still usable after being wiped? is it possible to reformat the hard drives for further use, and if so how?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> methods vary depending on your intended purpose.  </s>
<s> when i do this, i usually look for the manufacturer's destructive utility that performs a complete diagnostic test of the drive to disclose any problems such as bad sectors.  </s>
<s> once this is completed and if no deficiencies are noted, you use it as if it was a new drive.  </s>
<s> you partition and format the external drive using the computer you attach it to.  </s>
<s> and format the drives as desired with the your system os....specifically 'disk management'.  </s>
