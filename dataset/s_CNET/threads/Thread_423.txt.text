bought new dell dimension 8400 with 250 gb hard drive and xp professional. thinking of purchasing a 250 gb or 300 gb external drive for backup. i like what i have read about the dantz retrospect 7 professional software. will definitely automate backup. which drive would you purchase? lacie or maxtor? appreciate you helping me out!
that's just a copy without the needed measures to insure you don't lose it all. proof? just read the heart stopping stories in these forums. is a second copy enough? then you're ok, but don't count on it to replace a proper backup. bob
can you explain that statement? (i'm very much a computing novice.) i thought that's exactly what these hard drives were supposed to do. if not, what else do i need to do?
