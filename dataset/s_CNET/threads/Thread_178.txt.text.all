<s> i am planning on buying a wireless n router soon and was looking for some opinions on good and bad routers you may own.  </s>
<s> it needs to be compatible with an x-box 360 as well.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> reviews  </s>
<s> i was at circuit city today looking at n routers and the sales rep told me that if you have a wireless n router and connect any device to it that has a g card, then the entire network reverts to a g network.  </s>
<s> is that true?  </s>
<s> i will have a n desktop, g laptop, and g x-box 360.  </s>
<s> so if i connect the laptop and 360 to the network, it will not be an n network?  </s>
<s> if that's the case, then it seems like i am better off just sticking with my g router that i have. the other option the sales rep at cc told me was what he did in the same situation at his own home: use a wireless n router and a wireless g router in combination and use mac address discrimination between n and g devices to determine which router they use.  </s>
<s> the linksys wrt600n is an expensive choice at $150 -$200 but it makes the most sense for the following reasons: it is draft-n 2.0 compliant (which means it can be upgraded via a firmware update if there is a change in the 802.11-n standard once the final certification is complete) it has dual-band radios at 5ghz(802.11-a/n) and 2.4ghz (802.11-b/g).  </s>
<s> it is the only router that allows operation of both bands at the same time - which means it is the best router to use in a mixed environment of 802.11 a/b/g/n devices (similar routers such as the buffalo wzr-ag300nh and d-link dir-855 have not been released) pcworld magazine has named it &quot;the&quot; router to beat on a personal note - i have one with the following devices connected full-time or on-demand: -dell xps m1330 notebook (wireless) -d-link voip switch -playstation 3 (wireless) -psp (wireles) -ipod touch (wireless) -buffalo linkstation -hp-officejet pro l7680 aio printer see my review of the linksys wrt600n by clicking on my screen name.  </s>
