i have a emachines t3120 with a sempron 3100+. i have tried many times to overclock the cpu but the bios is crippled by emachines. there are no overclock options. i have tried to use software to overclock but the overclock is never saved. it reverts back to the original speed every time i restart my pc. people have been telling me that it is possible to overclock an emachines with a little know-how like getting a third party bios. my motherboard is a fic k8mc51g and there is no bios updates. can anybody help me thanks
if dell, emachines let you overclock, you might and then call in for support for the crashing machine. it's proper for name brand machines to never offer such. bob
your sempron is freq locked to the bus and you can't oc it w/o cutting traces & resoldering (messy, stay away). it is a 754 pin cpu running at 1800 mhz and in that package the family freq tops out at 2000 mhz so that is an indicator you won't get much gain even if you go down the messy route. you may be able to replace the cpu with an athlon64 but don't waste your money if the bios doesn't support athlons. besides, athlon64 isn't real cheap. stick with your pc until you have the money to buy a fancier one.
so dell, gateway , emachines , sony and other major pc manufacturers all don't allow u to overclock their pc's???
how could they stay in business? bob
