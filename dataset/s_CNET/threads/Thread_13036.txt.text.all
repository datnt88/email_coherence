<s> i am wondering if netbooks can handle skype and a couple other programs at the same time.  </s>
<s> the netbooks are starting to look attractive to me as a replacement for an old laptop that has roughly the same speed processor and a much smaller hard drive than comes with the netbooks.  </s>
<s> how practical is it to use one of these with skype (including video on both ends) while having perhaps a web browser and outlook open at the same time?  </s>
<s> howard  </s>
<s> i know skype alone is fine.  </s>
<s> i would not try that and playing music though.  </s>
<s> programs as in a web browser without playing a video at the same time?  </s>
<s> sure.  </s>
<s> and if i was unclear.  </s>
<s> forget skype video!  </s>
<s> just the phone feature for now.  </s>
<s> when the dual core atoms arrive my answer may change.  </s>

<s> daughters ibm thinkpad with xp pro (fast machine, heavy on ram) took forever to boot, forever to open a web page, slow all around, had to click shut down twice to get it to power off.  </s>
<s> i worked on it for a couple of days then noticed skype.  </s>
<s> uninstalled it and bam!  </s>
<s> boots in less than two minutes and all the other speed problems are gone.  </s>
<s> skype does take a lot of resources, but it is a service that is great for my needs and is an &quot;always on&quot; program for me.  </s>
<s> i use it to communicate with family, friends, and business contacts on three continents every day.  </s>
<s> thus my questions about its use on netbooks.  </s>
<s> okay, enough of my free advertising for skype ...  </s>
<s> then that's all that matters.  </s>
<s> just be prepared.  </s>
<s> skype is about the only thing i don't have a problem with on my acer aspire ... yes, the browser works a bit more slowly when i'm skyping, but then, i shouldn't be surfing the net while i'm talking to someone, should i?!  </s>
<s> i have an eee pc 1000; for me the determinant is internet speed.  </s>
<s> if my usb wireless connection gives me enough juice, skype video works fine.  </s>
<s> i usually have at least opera open, but turn off the music.  </s>
<s> but then i have 2gb of ram, fast ssd, and monitor what i have opened.  </s>
<s> yuor wifi connection will determine the decision the most (i've had it degrade to voice only).  </s>
<s> you are right about should not be surfing while talking.  </s>
<s> a bad habit i have picked up!  </s>
