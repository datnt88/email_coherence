what is the difference in the speed of sata compared to ata raid 0? which one of the two is faster? also, which of the two is the most cost effective solution of the two options? i would also get a motherboard that would support either of the two because i am planning on building my own gaming machine.
if you look at  you find that sata and pata can be, for arguments sake, speed equivilent. raid on either would have to be benchmarked. bob
sata is the means by which the hard drive connects to the computer. raid (redundant array of independant disks) was originally a security backup device using multiple identical hard drives. if one failed, all the data was still on one of the other drives. raid 0 changes this a bit however. it takes 2 drives and creates a single drive. not unlike dual-channel memory. it nearly double the rate that data can be both read and written. it requires a special controller that is either built into the motherboard, or can come as a seperate controller card.
