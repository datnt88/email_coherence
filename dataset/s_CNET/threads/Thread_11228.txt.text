i have a d-link wbr-1310 router and everytime the phone rings and is picked up, my internet connection becomes unplugged. i am new with routers & cox cable says it's the router. has anyone any information on the set up that would have caused this to happen? it's very frustrating. remember i am a rookie too.
that becomes unplugged, i would guess both the router and the phone are operating within the same frequency range. try moving the base stations further apart and change the channel that the router operates on.
thanks i will try that. not sure how to change the channel on the router but will get the book out. thanks again for your help.
i changed the channel two times and it still is doing it. my digital phone connection is close to my router so i suppose maybe a different phone on a different mgz speed might help?
you have tried moving the two further apart.
the house is wired close so i can't move it any farther. do you think a different router or phone mghz would help? i could buy a new phone. i have a netgear router i could hook up that is a wg102 model. thanks for all of your help. it's much appreciated.
go for the phone change.
