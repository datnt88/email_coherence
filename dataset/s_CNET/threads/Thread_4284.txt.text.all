i am able to login as administrator and then the screen appears with ok button, once it is pressed the screen goes back to login!!. this happened now, as i was logged into gigaset 504 to check settings and before logoff, resetted its power by removing plug. 
any help to make it work is appreciated. 
i had a few routers that did that with a browser. 
fix? 
i used other browsers. 
the router's maker did not plan on fixing that! 
thanks a lot, it is working on another brower, still not works on old browser, no problem!!!
