best buy and other places wont due to the risks but i dont want to do it myself due to the increased risk. i would also like to pay to have certain things overclocked. i did my vid card a little bit yesterday but the rest i would like to have done by a person skilled in that area as i do not want to read many guides on overclocking, this also was denied by best buy for same reason and not to my supprise my friends said that it was the same in almost all places except custom made computers on the internet however if you know of a place i would like to hear about it.

install them. im starting to wounder if there is a company that allows you to send in a computer so they can provide either or both of those services, i just know that there are webpages with customs that let you buy new ones that way. thanks for your post though.
i'm in boston and while you can take stuff to the stores the horror stories continue. why would we pay 140 bucks to install a 25 buck dvdrw drive? bob
you heard? and overclocking? do you know if cyberworks does liquid cooling because they used to here but now the nearest cyberworks is along way away.
and survive. overclocking is not an assured thing and a business could be held liable for the failures, reboots and you may even be upset over a disk data loss. so let's just say &quot;never going to happen.&quot; if you want to do this, you will be doing this. bob
ok thanks i kinda figured i was just hoping there was a waver that could be signed freeing them from responsability but thats the way she works i guess.
