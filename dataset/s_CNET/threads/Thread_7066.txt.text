i have been looking into getting a wireless g pc card (not the at&t/phone carrier ones, the netgear and linksys ones). i know that the pc cards boost your bandwith and help you to get a better internet connection. now, i've noticed that these handy gadgets can be very expensive. does anybody know a good, not pricey pc card that works great?
my laptop's internal works very nicely. bob
my laptop's internal is good for at home, but i travel around a lot. i just wish that my laptop's internal had a better connection....
notes an hawking unit that has an replaceable antenna. arm yourself with that and pick up a better antenna too. bob
i'm not sure that i will get this product, but thanks!
