6531	4	91934	1038074	1036610	mac52	3/12/05 2:31 pm	1.11063786e12	lol	i had a lot of fun reading your post. well, the feedback i read was from cnet's users opinion on the new imac g5. i want to make something clear too. out of the 450 something... opinions about the product, maybe only 10% or 15% were bad. but it happens that almost all the bad opinions were noisy-fan related and that makes you wonder if there could be a problem with an overheating system in the future since the desing is up to such a thing to happen. and about the frying thing, yes, there was some user that affirmed that his system fried due to overheating. but my concern about all of this is that it happens that i can be a person that can face the same situation and since i live in central america my invesment adquires a higher risk. i hope you guys can understand my concern. i'm not saying exactly that this will happen to me nor do i want you guys to think that i'm overreacting. i just wanna be sure before i make the decision. i will catch up my reading also. have a nice weekend.

(lousy sound effects!) our company sent it back to apple and the new g4 replacement was quiet as a church mouse. (bad fan) if you are worried about getting fried by apple, don't worry. apple will replace it! guaranteed and they do not want any of their apples fried. baked, maybe, with some brown sugar! i do not think that it would cost you anything to have it returned and sent back for a new imac-g5 if it ever came to that, being fried. what are the latest cnet reviews on the imac-g5? as a suggestion, go to about.com and read the reviews on the imac-g5. about.com has a ton of info also. one other site would be daniweb.com a forum site. nice! ask a question and get the answer. free to join apple stands behind all of its products. guaranteed. if you ever had a problem with an apple product and had to do a replacement, you would probably receive your replacement in the same time as i would living here in new england. check out the apple website and distribution. where do you live in central america? thanks for your post, kevin
