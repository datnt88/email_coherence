<s> here's the specs cpu - amd phenom 9150e quad-core processor ram - two 1gig ddr2 (it ses dual so i assume its two 1gigs) graphics - ati radeon hd 3200 im hoping to end up with a pretty solid gaming machine (for say bad company 2 and upcoming bc3) 19&quot; monitor at 1440x900 building from scratch id budget at around 1000 hoping to save if i can update this machine  </s>
<s> don't assume anything, know what you have with 100% certainly.  </s>
<s> then visit the acer support website and see if anything is offered as an &quot;upgrade&quot; option.  </s>
<s> two areas that can benefit immediately are ram and video.  </s>
<s> understand how your ram is set-up and add more.  </s>
<s> then proceed to better video and here for gaming that's where alot falls on a good video card.  </s>
<s> however, once a power hungry card is installed you need the psu that's &quot;very capable&quot; to support it and whatever else gets added.  </s>
<s> also, cooling is very important so add more cooling if possible and/or upgrade to more fans or liquid cooling.  </s>
<s> since, is to be a gaming rig, cooling will play an important part, so don't dismiss this until later.  </s>
<s> heat and wattage use will increase temps and start to degrade the overall components over time, do this asap.  </s>
<s> last, quality does matter, buy the good stuff.  </s>
<s> tada ------willy  </s>
<s> the 3200 video is the bottleneck.  </s>
<s> what you the about 100 buck gpu from this list to spice it up?  </s>
