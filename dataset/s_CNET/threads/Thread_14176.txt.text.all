<s> problem with epson 4490 scanner & vista : i just reinstalled vista business on my dell vostro 420 desktop computer to clear up some nagging software/hardware glitches.  </s>
<s> [dell support suggested and walked me through the process.] the epson perfection 4490 photo scanner worked fine on my dell latitude d820 laptop (using windows xp professional).  </s>
<s> it even worked on the vostro that originally came with vista business installed.  </s>
<s> after the vista reinstall, i reinstalled the epson and the system crashed soon after, came back with a lengthy microsoft error message about a usb driver problem, and offered corrective suggestions.  </s>
<s> one of these was to disconnect any recently installed usb device(s).  </s>
<s> i unplugged the usb, while leaving the epson program files installed.  </s>
<s> end of usb driver problem.  </s>
<s> so it seems i need to download new driver(s) for using the epson 4490 with vista yes?  </s>
<s> whats the step-by-step procedure here please?  </s>
<s> do i leave (1) the epson program files installed, (2) download the latest driver(s) from epson, (3) reconnect the epson usb cable, and (4) reboot?  </s>
<s> or do i uninstall everything epson 4490 first and start for scratch?  </s>
<s> if so, at one point do the new drivers come into play?  </s>
<s> sorry but ive never had to update xp pro-era hardware (or software) with updated drivers for a new operating system.  </s>
<s> btw, ive also heard that epsons 4490 drivers can be problematic with vista i.e. they dont always work.  </s>
<s> ?? thanks, shamrock838  </s>
<s> installing windows (all versions) is a long painful hunt for drivers for the machine and all accessories.  </s>
<s> there is never a step by step procedure for each machine from what i can tell.  </s>
<s> only guides.  </s>
<s> and there must be thousands out there making a fine living installing windows.  </s>
<s> what i would do is to recreate the machine just like dell delivered.  </s>
<s> use dell's restore media and all their cds supplied or ordered from dell.  </s>
<s> i do know some try the &quot;clean install&quot; or want that but i find many just get upset over the days and weeks of efforts to do that.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> actually dell did guide me through the install over the phone and we went through the dell cd's one at a time.  </s>
<s> with the &quot;drivers and utilities&quot; cd he followed a set procedure of which drivers to reinstall when.  </s>
<s> i'm assuming he knew what he was doing.  </s>
<s> so -- per my original post -- where might this leave me re the epson driver(s) and how to install them?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> repeat what you did last time.  </s>
<s> sadly i see no reason to do it any other way.  </s>
<s> if that fails, it's time to decide if a new scanner which you can ask for install support is the cheap exit.  </s>
<s> any shop counter will run more than a replacement scanner.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> since i don't have the lengthy microsoft error message about a usb driver problem to work with i can not address this here.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> actually, the vostro desktop came pre-installed with vista business from dell.  </s>
<s> i never did the original vista install, nor would i even have attempted doing so.  </s>
<s> at first i was torn between staying with xp pro and advancing to vista.  </s>
<s> i finally went with new technology rather than old.  </s>
<s> perhaps my last resort should be to contact epson directly re this matter.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i printed out this microsofr message that's entitled &quot;problem caused by usb driver.&quot;  </s>
<s> it's four pages long and i can e-mail a photocopy to you if interested.  </s>
<s> alternately, i did i print screen of the first page into a word .doc  </s>
<s> file.  </s>
<s> if this forum allows attachments, i can send it that way.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> reading it appears they still have some bugs to pound out.  </s>
<s> that is not the only kb article they have on this problem.  </s>
<s> dell and ms however should get you moving.  </s>
<s> in closing, be sure to use the rear usb ports if on a desktop machine to avoid another issue.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> my vostro 420 desktop has (6) rear usb ports and another (4) in the front.  </s>
<s> why are rear ports to be preferred over their front counterparts?  </s>
<s> and what if i need additional usb ports?  </s>
<s> i've heard conflicting reports about external usb hubs.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> why are rear ports to be preferred over their front counterparts?  </s>
<s> it has to do with the wiring used.  </s>
<s> for years i've encountered issues with front ports.  </s>
<s> to avoid this i use the rear ports when there is trouble.  </s>
<s> sorry but it's late so i'll stop here and not answer why the industry is in a fine mess.  </s>
