dell demension 8250 will not start what so ever. i shut it down last night and had intended to start it back up this morning, but it will not come back on. i have checked the plugs and everything, anyways to reset it or something?
if the fan twitches a bit and stops, you've got a bad power supply or something overloading it. if no twitching, it could still the the ps but could also be your power on switch. i'm presuming you've verified that you have ac into the ps.
yeah im gettin nothin from the ps, by ac if you mean chord, then yes lol i havent tested any plugs yet
theres a greeb light on on the motherboard, sooooo .................???
