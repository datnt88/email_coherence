i'm hoping to get advice on what the best/fastest cable modem/router device is? i currently have a motorola surfboard sbg6580. it works good, but it interferes with my direct tv so i can't use it and need to find another.... so, what is the best??? price doesn't matter. i just want the best one. thanks!
not sure why this or any other would interfere. is there more to this story?
i have no clue, neither does directv, but they are the ones that told me i can't use this modem with their service. so is there any other modem/router combo unit that is better?
i have to guess at this point you are dropping the cable internet service so with that out of the way, your new service will determine what modem is required. bob
