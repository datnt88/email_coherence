<s> opinions?  </s>
<s> this is not a new problem.  </s>
<s> there are thousands of folk with this issue so my question is why your suppliers have left you out on the road with a dead car and no gas?  </s>
<s> as you can tell it's rarely the same thing and the advice repeats often.  </s>
<s> that is, start with less parts and never skimp on the psu if you can't add up the amperes and know why you get a single rail when you can't add it up.  </s>

<s> i agree with robert's post, something is amiss and you have tear it down and get to the basics.  </s>
<s> recheck your work and that means tearing it down out of case.  </s>
<s> using cardboard, rebuild the system on it and make that a &quot;minimum system&quot; just what it needs to boot.  </s>
<s> in fact you need no drives at all, see what it does upon applying power, it should at least get to the error display or try entering a bios display.  </s>
<s> in other words, its up and running but can't go far but remains, &quot;on&quot;.  </s>
<s> don't take anything for granted and don't be in a rush to build, check and verify it all.  </s>
