i think th price and it's features are really good and cheap i could find the same features with almost a double price. what do you rate this computer?
i am not one to recommend all in one units unless that is the only way you can go with a puter. they are just laptops on steroids and if it needs to be serviced after warranty it is going to cost you more. that is a good price for what your getting but you could very well lose the money your going to save if it has problems after the warranty expires. did you read the reviews, they were all one stars. i would keep looking.
worry if you would be upset by repair costs later. it's not like a desktop where you change this or that. but with the nvidia gpu and the nice cpu you may find a gamer using it. bob
what are the good and the bad about this computer?
bad = repair costs are usually same as laptops. can be upsetting to folk used to desktop repair costs.
