could anyone please help for a replacement for hyperterminal. i used one yesterday but i cannot remember the name other than it had a q in it somewhere. you could also do macro's on it to. if anyone could help that would be great!!!
found out what it the name was. qmodem. they dont make it anymore so does anyone know a suitable replacement.
procomm plus was a fav back then too.
&lt;a href=&quot;  &gt;zoc&lt;/a&gt; is close to hyperterminal in features (offering serial and telnet connections).
i bet you were using teraterm - it's similiar to hyperterminal and has pretty good scripting support. if you are looking for a good application that can monitor multiple com port connections in the same application, try poderosa  or foxterm

i didn't find ymodem support. also it's got some annoying product banner on it. try again? bob
