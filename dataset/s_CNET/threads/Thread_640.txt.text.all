<s> i want to use my new pc to record tv shows, burn cd's and dvd's, digital photography and eventually video.  </s>
<s> i'm seriuously considering buying this package (17'' lcd, canon printer)which doesn't have a tv tuner/remote for $999: gtw 835gm pentium d processor 820 dual-core processing 1024mb of ddr2 ram 250gb 7200rpm hard drive dual dvd drives windows xp media center or for $1229 i could get this one (same bundle) with the tv tuner/remote: gateway - 830 media center desktop 840gm intel pentium d processor 830; dl dvdrw/cd-rw and dvd-rom drives; 250gb hard drive; 1gb pc4200 ddr2 memory; windows xp media center 2005; tv tuner; 8-in-1 media manager my question is would it be cheaper and easy enough for an intermediate pc user like myself to buy and install a tv tuner card?  </s>
<s> are the usb tuners an easier option?  </s>
<s> what about the remote?  </s>
<s> can i buy that too?  </s>
<s> i realize the processor is slightly faster but i doubt i would notice the difference.  </s>
<s> the tv-tuner one.  </s>
<s> because 830=2x3.0ghz and 820=2x2.8ghz.  </s>
<s> but i do believe that both contains a tv-tuner.  </s>
<s> roger  </s>
<s> yes. it will include a remote and the ir connector.  </s>
<s> go the 830gm.  </s>
<s> konny  </s>
<s> i was actually at best buy the other day and asked why the 840gm was $200 more and the salesman told me because of the slightly newer/faster processor and because it had the tv tuner card where the 835gm did not (he even turned the thing around and checked).  </s>
<s> i thought this was totally retarded for a thousand dollar ''media pc'' to not have the card already.  </s>
<s> after all, isn't being able to watch and record tv the biggest feature of using xp media center?  </s>
<s> just get the emachines t6522 than, it includes one.  </s>
<s> only downside is lack of dual-core and btx chassis.  </s>
<s> if you really want, suggest getting the 835gm, because a better tv-tuner card such as the all-in-wonder x600pro pci-express card can be had for less than the difference of $200.  </s>
<s> or paired with .  </s>
<s> thanks for the links, masta.  </s>
<s> i just got back from bb (i hate that place.  </s>
<s> third time there, third bad experience with sales help.) so i was gonna shell out the extra $200 for the 840gm and i realized they jacked up the price to $1399! it was on sale for $1229 on wednesday and the tag said sale price good thru 08/13.  </s>
<s> i even got the sales guy to confirm this and i told him i'd be back to buy it this weekend. the guy today tells me their sale always ends on saturday and a new one begins on sunday.  </s>
<s> whatever!  </s>
<s> while i was waiting for some help i actually took a peak at an hp with media center and i really didn't like the way it works anyway.  </s>
<s> all those giant icons and step by step instructions on how to do stuff like play a cd or look at your digital photos.  </s>
<s> it's like they designed mc for complete retards!  </s>
<s> i guess it was a blessing in disguise that the sale ended.  </s>
<s> i'm gonna start re-shopping for another pc with xp home and just buy a tuner card.  </s>
<s> thanks again for the links!  </s>
