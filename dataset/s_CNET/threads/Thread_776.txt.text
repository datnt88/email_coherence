and the first gpu (video card) i checked noted over 400 watt power supply so you are pressing your luck there. as to which video card, for the past few years i still like this list updated almost every month. read and pick from  toms did motherboard comparisons a few times and found less than 2 percent variation in benchmarks when using same settings for ram, same gpu, etc. go with the board that people review nicely (see newegg.com comments.) bob
much appreciated!
