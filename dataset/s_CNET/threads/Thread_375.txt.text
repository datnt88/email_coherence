ok, a friend has an old emachine with windows 98 on it, and every once in a while it just magically powers up all on its own. any ideas on how to trouble shoot this? would this be a problem with the mobo or other hardware or is it a win 98 thing? any advice would be appreciated - fj
bios feature? look around in the bios (power section ?) see if you have something like 'wake on lan' 'wake on ring' 'wake on ....something'. i never tested any of these things as i don't use the bios or windows p.m. feature.
i have an old win98 machine that comes on in the middle of the night too. i have assumed that it is doing maintenence which is scheduled to be done by the program which you set up to do these things (forgot the name--i don't use the pc much). check the program list--i think under accessories. &quot;scheduled maintenence&quot; or some such.
i dont think the computer will start itself for maintenance since automatic update and virus software are run by the windows os and not by the hardware (windows software does not boot) on the other hand, the bios has a setting for starting the computer at a certain date, at a certain time. i also dont think the &quot;wake up&quot; options work for a full boot, i thing they are to wake from soft off.
