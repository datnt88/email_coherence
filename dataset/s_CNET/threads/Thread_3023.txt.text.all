<s> [url= [/img][/url] actually i have another question this hard disk has been on problem with udma as shown here [img] [/img] when i emailed wd &quot; the company of the hdd &quot; their techiqual support say it may be from the firmware of the hdd because it was not intended to be in a desktop computer it was intended to be for pvr/dvr and dvd recorders so please help me  </s>
<s> now that you know, did you try a new hard drive intended for us in a pc? bob  </s>
<s> if this is a cable problem then try another one.  </s>
<s> as for the dual reference, the hd if not originally for pc use, tends to be optimized for dvr, etc., is more smart and/or receptacle for that intended purpose.  </s>
<s> they do that for this very reason, not to be used in pcs to gain access to whatever data those vendors use to optimize usage.  </s>
<s> you can't just wipe it clean as the maker tech's offered its a i/c chip(firmware) setup.  </s>
<s> also, in my experience, the access to the hd is done via the dvr box once connected to whatever setup and it d/l's the required s/w for its use.  </s>
<s> which in effect optimizes for non-pc use.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
