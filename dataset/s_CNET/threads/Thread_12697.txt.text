i've got an lcd monitor that can take vga input. i would like to buy a cable so that i can use my wireless keyboard and mouse from my bed. the only thing is i am not sure which cable to get. i see that there are db15 and hd15. what is the difference?
there are limits to how long you can reliably get away with. pure guess would be that the hd is a better made and shielded cable to allow possibilities of running with a longer cable. price may show the difference.
my card has a dvi connection so i would be getting a dvi to apg converter and then a 10' cable. so i should go with the hd15?
cable will probably work ok. i assume that the adapter is simply the standard block about 2 inches long.
