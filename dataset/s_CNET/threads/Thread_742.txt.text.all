<s> hi all, i recently bought a good digital slr. then realized i needed to take a course in photoshop.  </s>
<s> while taking the course i noted the mac monitors in school have much better resolution and color separation than the 20 monitor that came w/ my pc. i dont want to buy a mac so i figured i could upgrade my screen and then buy a spyder to calibrate it.  </s>
<s> i am looking for a good 24 to 27 unit that is not in the nosebleed price range (over 1500$) the specs on the machine are; 2.4 ghz quad core w/ 3 gigs of memory and an nvidia geforce 8600 gt card. the machine has no problem handling photoshop cs4 any help can get w/ this decision would be great.  </s>
<s> thanks, apple 25  </s>
<s> than any other pc monitors (if we can call that).  </s>
<s> just go get the best you cab afford.  </s>
<s> or maybe one with led backlited one.  </s>
<s> it is soppose to give better contrast ratio (but i don't how important that is to your work).  </s>
<s> also maybe a better video card might help as well (just guessing here).  </s>
<s> just make sure they are not tn monitors.  </s>
<s> get the make and model from the mac monitor and then you can research the unit.  </s>
<s> with the specs in hand.....go shopping.  </s>
<s> available from other mfgs.  </s>
<s> pc connection has a nice search engine and an endless selection of monitors with a variety of specs.  </s>
<s> are you looking for a high-gloss or matte finish lcd ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> it doesnt look like the mac will hook up to a pc btw are you asking about the case of the monitor when you said glossy or flat?  </s>
<s> if that's the question i couldn't care less if the case has pink polka dots on it as long as it will give me better color sep and depth  </s>
<s> i have a 24 inch lcd with a matte finish lcd and a 17&quot; laptop with a gloss finish lcd.  </s>
<s> i really like the 24 in lcd with the matte finish but really struggle with the gloss finish lcd on the laptop as it seems to reflect almost anything from anywhere.  </s>
<s> i'm talking about matching the general monitor specs... dot pitch, viewing angle, contrast, color depth, etc., as the starting point to find lcds that match mac lcd specs.  </s>
<s> like you ...i can't fathom there aren't lcds made by mfgs that aren't as good or better than those made by apple.  </s>
<s> pink polka dots on the frame ?  </s>
<s> .... think i'd find those distracting too.  </s>
<s> good luck and let us know what you decide on.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> how about that, since this is my first lcd desk top and i have never owned a lap top i didn't know they made the screens in gloss finish like the old crt's huh.  </s>
<s> i started to look around on camera web sites and it seems the industry standard is lacie, eizo or nec.  </s>
<s> they all make models w/ caliberation software but they are all very pricey.  </s>
<s> i don't think i'll be buying a 30&quot; any time soon unless i hit the lottery.  </s>
<s> i live 20 min north of nyc and they have one of the largest camera shops in the world there.  </s>
<s> i'm going to call them next week to see if they have any of the units set up for a look see.  </s>
<s> i'll keep you up to speed on my selection.  </s>
<s> to the gloss finish to get brighter screens with more vivid color to attract buyers.  </s>
<s> they look great for the moment but for day after day long term use ... i'll take the non-glare matte (non-glare) finish anytime.  </s>
<s> re visiting retailers in nyc....great idea.  </s>
<s> no better way than first hand to find what pleases you.  </s>
<s> places like best buy, microcenter also have monitors on display you can see before buying.  </s>
<s> we'll look forward to seeing your findings and observations.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> i broke down and went for the big bucks.  </s>
<s> i got a nec lcd3090wqi 30&quot; unit and a spyder3 elite calibration software.  </s>
<s> it was the cheapest pro unit in that size.  </s>
<s> i am very happy with the setup.  </s>
