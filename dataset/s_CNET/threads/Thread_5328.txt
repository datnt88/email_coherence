(after a couple of warnings that windows can't verify the driver) then it asks for pxhelp20.sys file. i find it in my windows/system32/drivers directory and install. then it finish and says &quot;there was a problem installing this hardware.&quot; i end up doing the same thing again next time i reboot? any idea what i need to do? my only worry is that i plan to re-install windows here in about two weeks. and i need this drive to work? my computer is a asus p800-deluxe p4 1gb of ram?

4038	3	256334	2540330	2540286	bob b	7/15/07 6:28 am	1.18448088e12	hmm.	there should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update. ------------- perhaps that's true for a dvd?? what i've seen with other hardware is the firmware update seems to change the device type/id. when windows goes looking for a driver to match the type/id there is no match. now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware.
4038	4	256334	2540741	2540330	tubaloth	7/15/07 5:27 pm	1.18452042e12	any other ideas?	&gt;&gt;&gt;why update the driver if the old one works ok?. usually to help boost performance some, and so forth. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update. i agree that is what so surprising. also i have another (older) dvd burner that works just fine, no driver problems. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware. the site doesnt have any drivers for its cd/dvd drives. as far as i have seen, they want us to use the windows xp driver. i dont know if i have some newer driver that windows thinks it should install or what? i cant find the right *.inf file to get this to install properly.

4038	7	256334	2542698	2542145	lacsr	7/18/07 5:03 am	1.18473498e12	i looked up that warning you got	they are talking about the problem you have here:  also as you read down the list, there is a post that says go here:  give it a try to see if that will fix the problem.
