i was shopping around for a new 19&quot; lcd and wanted a decent resopnse time for gaming. i hit best buy to touch/feel and saw the viewsonic vx910 for 449.00 and thought hmmm, but a 25ms response time would not cut it in counterstike source, so i went online and saw on the viewsonic web site the vx910 has a 16 ms response time...hmm. i went back to bb and called viewsonic from there...any lcd made after december is 16 ms. i gave them the serial number of the model on display it was 25 and then the one from the box i was to buy and yippie it was 16!!!!! so, for that price i am happy . any - just an fyi for any gamers looking for a good lcd 19&quot;...it is so sweet.
see the samsung 915n 8 ms and great price!!!!!!!!!!!!
i was personally gonna say, 16ms is still pretty high..
