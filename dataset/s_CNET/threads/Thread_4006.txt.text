currently, i have an athlon xp 2000+ cpu and 512mb pc2700 333mhz ram. i believe the cpu can only operate at the 233 fsb level. the mb is msi kt333 ultra. i am looking to upgrade without upgrading the motherboard which can support upto xp 2700+. would it be worth the money to upgrade to the athlon 2700+ xp cpu and 1gb ram?
to first spend the money on a better mobo and get like a 3000+ or 3200+ processor. i would leave the ram for a later time.
fyi, i have a 2000xp with 512mb it will do a seti unit in 4~5 hours. i also have a 2700xp with 1gb it will do a seti unit 3~4 hours. so draw you own conclusion. john
