in my office a lan runs by using ip address 192.168.0.series through a l3 managed telco systems switch (t5pro).this switch also has the ip address of the above mentioned series.now, it is required to run a two other ip address series e.g. 192.168.1.1 to 254 & 192.168.2.1 to 254 through the same switch without changing the existing ip address i.e. 192.168.0....for two other packages. my question is, is it possible to run the different ip series through the same switch? if, yes, then how can i do this.
our switches required no changes to run our lan of 192.x.x.x when we used (added) machines in the 10.x.x.x range. i wonder if you have a router though. switches don't usually need any changes. bob
thanks bob, i also have that idea. in case of unmanaged switches no change is required,so the same will be applicable to managed switches.
