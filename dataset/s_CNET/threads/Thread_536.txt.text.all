<s> you need the usb header cable which will connect the reader to the usb ports on the motherboard.  </s>
<s> optional at extra cost.  </s>
<s> looking at the picture, the cable shown is the header cable.  </s>
<s> you will need the available header port on the motherboard to plug into.  </s>
<s> thats the thing the board does not have anything like that  </s>
<s> how do i find one of those so far i cant find it  </s>
<s> i have a similar unit made by ge.  </s>
<s> oh i see this is one of those external readers i kinda wanted to install the internal kind that was in the link i provided but since this is my only option i guess ill try this one thanks for the help  </s>
<s> unless you have a spare usb header on the motherboard, this is your only option.  </s>
