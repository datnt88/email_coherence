that seems to be a common dell problem. 
gives 4500 hits. 
you might try to find the cause and remedy yourself (i suppose it's somewhere in the results) or contact dell tech support.

yes i have called them but they want to charge me 100 dollars thanks noel 
unless somebody happens to have hands-on experience with this problem, i don't think anybody will read through those hits for you and make a nice summary of things to try.

you may be passing up on the answer.
