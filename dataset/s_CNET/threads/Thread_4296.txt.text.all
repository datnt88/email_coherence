<s> do you really need a seperate hard drive for your windows operating system?  </s>
<s> i do light video editing and light gaming, some people say to seperate the os to a another drive.  </s>
<s> such is easy to answer since most run the os, applications and more on one hard disk.  </s>
<s> not needed or required.  </s>
<s> the proof is all around us.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'm a strong proponent for separating the os and apps (c:) from the data (d:) even if they're just partitions on the same hard disk drive.  </s>
<s> this makes it easier to do backups because the partitions are smaller (only os and apps vs os apps and data) and makes it safer to recover from a system crasj because your data is isolated on d: to faciliate backups, restores and minimize downtime ...i always put a second drive in every system i build to store my backups of c: and d:  </s>
