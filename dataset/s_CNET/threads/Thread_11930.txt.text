windows will not fully boot on my wives laptop. i have tried safe mode, and everything. i took the hard drive out. hooked it to an external connector and accessed it on my laptop. i ran several scans and they found the virus and deleted the affected files. obviously that will not fix the damage to system files. so i have two options. 1. i can reformat the drive and reinstall windows and all her other stuff. which i am fully capable of doing. the problem is she has alot of photos on the drive. i have tried accessing the photos using the same external method but access is denied. she had her laptop password protected. i know the password, i was the one who initialy set it up. is there anyway i can get to the files to back them up before i format the drive? 2. my other option is to put the windows disc in the machine and boot to the disc. i hit r to run windows recover to try and repair the system files. when i do this i am prompted for a administrative password. i do not beleive this password is something i have ever set. the laptop is only 2 years old and i am the one who initially set it up. i know what passwords i used and none of them allow me run recovery. is this a default pasword for toshiba or windows? i have 2 options to save her files but i am currently being blocked by two problems. i appreciate any help you can provide. thank you again i am open to new ideas.
type ntpasswd on google.com and with that, the password issue is solved. moving on. type xp take ownership on google and that solves your access denied issue. what's left? nothing i can find so i'll stop here. bob
thank you
