i've searched the forums for an answer to this question, but the information i've found has been pretty old. so i wondered if there might be a more current answer. i have no land line, using only my cell phone for calls and cable broadband for internet. what, if any, options do i have if i want to be able to fax documents from home? i tried efax once upon a time, several years ago (2003, i think), but found it to be twitchy with a mac. (fonts would frequently get messed up.) i imagine the service may have improved by now, but i would *so* prefer being able to fax in a more conventional way. most of the documents i need to fax are not originating from the computer, often being forms filled out by hand. i'm having a hard time believing that there is *no* faxing option for those of us without land lines! it's becoming more and more common to not have one. can anyone help? (just in case it might be relevant: i have an older imac running os 10.3.9 with a mere 500mhz g3 chip and 384 mb of ram.) (...please don't laugh. i'm a poor social worker!) thanks!!
to fix the issue with efax, push your content to pdf or &quot;images&quot; before the fax. bob
we currently use ureach for our business, and have been very happy with it. i would recommend checking it out. and i do not work for ureach, i own my own company.
hey there fellow ureach customer, i have a question for you. are you getting buckets of russian spam? do you have any ideas of what to do about it? thanks!
lucky, i have not, yet. since we get faxes daily and only use ureach for receiving faxes, i think we have gotten lucky. i know my spam folder does a good job of catching stuff, but i just click empty and never look at it.
