ok, this has been a lingering problem. i have wireless on my computer. the problem is that everytime i open ie, i get that its not connecting to internet message. it gives me an option of running the windows diagnostic, which i do. it usually works, then i can get online. sometimes i have to run it a few times before i can get online. any suggestions?
if so, the wireless connection could be lost and it's taking a bit to get reconnected. if you have the network connection icon in your system tray (lower right corner) you can quickly check its status by putting the pointer over it.
no, it doesnt go asleep. this happens right when i power up. i do show a strong signal, on my network (and my other laptop does work fine). ie just always makes me go through the dignostic in orer to use the internet. is there a setting taht i am missing?
i had the same situations before.. what you can try is updating the router driver. also u can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the router driver.
i dont recall ever installing the driver for the router, its plug and play
