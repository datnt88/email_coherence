during startup my computer is giving me an error message: explored caused an exception oih in module shdocvw.dll at 0167:77c6901b any ideas...please help. thanks,
look at the top note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
as the other post says you haven't told us much, you say you get the error but dont say if your system crashes! anyway shdocvw.dll is a iexplorer file so it is likely you have spyware as (i assume) a program at startup is trying to load a web page. therefore run spyware programs and if that doesn't work stop items in the startup folder of msconfig from loading until you find the culprit. peter
