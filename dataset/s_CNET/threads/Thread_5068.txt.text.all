<s> cable is not digital.  </s>
<s> it's an analog signal that carries digital information.  </s>
<s> it's a common selling point, but a little investigation will reveal the truth.  </s>
<s> because of the bandwidth involved, a great picture can be received, and the leftover is available for internet.  </s>
<s> but i digress.  </s>
<s> get the tuner card.  </s>
<s> a good one can be had for under a hundred bucks.  </s>
<s> don't spend a load on an expensive card to view on a 17&quot; monitor, it's just not worth it.  </s>
<s> visit the better internet selling sites, shop around.  </s>
<s> i like buy.com and newegg.com.  </s>
<s> there are others in abundance.  </s>
<s> do a google search on tuner cards.  </s>
