<s> i've got an emachines et1331g-03w, and i want to install xp pro x64 on it, so i can play games that don't support the factory-installed windows 7 home premium, which i upgraded to professional with my own key, and i know how bad xp is with drivers on a fresh install.  </s>
<s> i need some drivers to keep on my flash drive, can anyone help out?  </s>
<s> desktop &gt; et series &gt; et1331g those drivers only work on 7, so can anyone help me out?  </s>
<s> i have that and why wouldn't i use that?  </s>
<s> as to the drivers, good hunting.  </s>
<s> it's getting harder and going to get worse.  </s>
<s> read another reason why at again, good luck in your xp 64 bit driver hunt.  </s>

<s> that i want to go down to xp is, i wanna be able to play some games that just don't support 7...yet.  </s>
<s> i'm all up for dual-booting xp and 7, i already know how to do that.  </s>
<s> i'll just need to acquire the right drivers, and then the rest will most likely be easy as pie.  </s>
<s> it appears you need to research xp mode more.  </s>

<s> i have had xp mode for a while now, but it doesn't offer 32 bit color...is there a workaround?  </s>

<s> i never really was a big fan of windows in general, but to be able to run my adobe products i need windows and for anything past cs2 wine can not run it.  </s>
<s> i have gotten the drivers before from talking to emachine web tech support, i had to talk to 4 different people but i did get a copy of the drivers needed for xp on my machine ( et1331g-o5w) so they are out there just might have to talk to few different tech support people or go on a good search.  </s>
