i have never started a web page but i do have a web page registered. does anyone have info. on a cheap program or site to set up the first web page myself. i wish to do it myself and make changes in it monthly for a small retail store? tks for your time.
this is a pretty broad questions, with lots of things to consider... you said you have a page registered, do you know how/where you will be hosting it? are you going to be running your own server or will you have it hosted by another company? since you are a small business, i would assume you will have someone host the site for you. i would work with whomever you have host your site to answer your other questions. some companies will have development tools as part of the hosting package. others will require you to create the files yourself (using any popular program, dreamweaver, frontpage, etc.) and use ftp to upload them to a server. i think you need to resolve the hosting question first before you can start to consider the development.
most hosts will provide web page creation tools for simple web pages. i used word 2000 for my web site. it works perfectly for my simple needs. microsoft front page is a pretty powerful (i have it but don't use it). for a simple web page, microsoft word (any later versions) is more than adequite for most users. just sit down and start playing with it. then upload it to your host. you'll need to talk to them on the specifics of uploading pages. wayne there are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't. click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software.
