i would like to upgrade my video for this current retail gateway system i have. currently i have a nvidia geoforce 7300le, with a 300 w power supply. what would be the best video card i would get still using the 300 watt power supply?
what are the other specifications of the machine? the most i could say would be a 8600gt. maybe a 8600gts, but that might be pushing it. ~ibrahim~
i have a 19 inch monitor, intel core 2 duo e6300 chip.
not too many hard drives/optical drives? how much memory, by chance? doesn't effect power usage hardly any, but good to check, anyways. i assume you'll be using 1280x1024 or below as a standard resolution, right? i would say an 8600gts would be the absolute maximum. i'm a wee bit afraid it actually might be too much. the 8600gt is slower, yet draws less power. actually, scratch that. the 8600gts requires external power, which i'm not sure that psu includes. of course, you could get adapters and such, but i'd feel safer with the 8600gt. &quot;it [8600gts] is designed to draw about 71 watts of power during operation. the geforce 8600 gt is significantly slower, but also uses significantly less power. it is designed to consume 43 watts and ...&quot; check out this review:  between both the cards. ~ibrahim~ p.s. i'm not very up to date on the hd2xxx series by ati, maybe someone can shed some light on those?
my system was bought last october, so it is not old. duo 2 core chip, with nvidia 7300le card, and 2 gb ram, 300 watt power supply. i wonder if i could replace the video card with the following: nvidia 7800 or 7900 series. thx
those cards are pushing the limits of the power supply. i think most if not all of those cards require a external power supply, which means they draw more than the 75w that the slot itself can provide. it isn't a particularly heavily taxed system, but 300w doesn't seem like enough. most those cards require a 350w minimum. i'm really sorry... what resolution are you running, per chance? the 7600gt is a great deal right now and the 8600gt isn't a bad card, either. the 8600gts is not too much slower than the 7800gt, but the 8600gt is. kind of confusing, but check out these charts:  unfortunately, they don't include the 8600gt! ~ibrahim~
