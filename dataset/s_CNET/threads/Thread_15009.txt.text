the dvd drive of my lap top [hp 1615 model] is matshita-uj 840-d. for past one month it is failing to read certain dvds as well as writing cds.. but it reads the dvds i have burned from the same drive.. the problem is more for dvds from other computers.. please help me!!
the drive might just need cleaning.
be sure no packet writing software was used. incd, dla and others create such problems. bob
