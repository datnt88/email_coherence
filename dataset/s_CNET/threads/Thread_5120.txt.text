does anybody know how i can go wireless any where at anytime? i have a gateway tablet please help!
what would you connect to? cell phone usage is spotty to non-existant so evdo is out. tell how to connect and if your airline allows it. bob
there's been talk of domestic airlines providing wireless internet in-flight. right now there are international airlines that provide it, with united (i think) being the first to be given clearance to insitute the technology here in the us. given the financial issues many airlines are having, it may be a slow roll-out, but it will eventually happen. christa
