i have a seagate 320gb internal hdd i pulled out of my old hp pavilion slimline 3123w. i have the hdd hooked up to my new pc with an enclosure and an esata to usb cable. my new pc recognizes the drive itself but it only shows the windows recovery part of the drive. how do i access the data on the actual hdd?
what does disk management say about the drive? kees
the cnet storage forum notes free and free to try tools and a miracle. link:
disk management only shows the hdd as drive d: with a capacity of 11.83 gb
see  copy/paste this long link. it should show at least the full 320 gb, if there's no hardware issue somewhere. kees
