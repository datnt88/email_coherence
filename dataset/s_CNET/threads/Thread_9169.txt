8987	3	181102	1982624	1981371	vapcmd	6/4/06 6:11 pm	1.14944466e12	guess we can rule out ambient temp....why not try removing	the stock hs fan, clean it up good and reinstall it using some arctic silver 5. they've got good info on how to apply it. if that doesn't do it...then i'd spring for the better hs fan combo to add to that mini-hovercraft. almost hard to understand how that cpu could be running hot with all those fans unless of course it wasn't sitting flush now. let me know how it works.

8987	8	181102	1984960	1984337	whyfi	6/6/06 5:08 am	1.14957048e12	re:	different designs and i haven't seen any tests between the two on the same system. the 9500 is simply one of the very best air coolers out there as far as cpu temps go - see this comparison for more info. again, not only is it extremely efficient at cooling the cpu, but it blows all of that hot air directly out keeping your case temps lower. i'm sure that the cooler that you linked is great, too, but i would suspect that it falls a little short of the 9500's performance as far as cpu cooling goes. it may, however, keep some of your other components a little cooler because of fan orientation (blowing down on the motherboard). two things to consider, though - 1) it's very big in diameter - make sure it's not going to conflict with other components in your case, 2) you're paying an extra 20 bucks over the 7700 for an additional 400 rpms and the fata1ity name. for my money, i obviously felt the 9500 a better choice, although i'm certain that you're not going to be disappointed with either.
