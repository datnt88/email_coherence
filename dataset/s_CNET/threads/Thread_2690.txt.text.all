<s> my old graphics card is broke, (geforce 4 ti 4200), and i got half life 2 for christmas, do you think this graphics card can handle it and is it worth the money?  </s>
<s> it's a good card, but in todays market most of the video cards are good.  </s>
<s> what it comes down to is how much $$$ you have to spend.  </s>
<s> i never buy the lastest greatest but wait for price to comes down then buy a &quot;newer&quot; video card.  </s>
<s> so now you can get that card for a good price.  </s>
<s> john  </s>
<s> most video card reviews show that card or its close cousin(series) as very good.  </s>
<s> your new game will certainly be better for it. is it worth the money, well i never spent that much for a video card as i'm a &quot;trailing edge&quot; sorta user not a bleeding edge and wait for costs to be more reasonable.  </s>
<s> you can check the for a review and/or check pricelists for comments made by buyers.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
