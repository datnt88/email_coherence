after switching from pc to mac and hooking up my mp730 my prints all turn out at about 50% or smaller, jammed up into a corner of the letter size sheets. i've looked through all the preferences, print menus, etc to no avail. it happens everytime, no matter what the program is i'm printing from - word, a web page, photoshop, etc. this never happened when hooked up to my pc. i can't find drivers for the mp730 on apple's site, so don't know what to do or whom to contact. advice anyone?
is it mac compatible? if so, go to the manufacturer's website and download the mac drivers from there and install them. evidently mac &quot;plug & play&quot; didn't handle that model right. and life goes on... jack
i have experienced exactly the same problem but not found a solution -- have you? ddc1704
i saw your posting about the mp730 driver when switching from pc to mac i'm considering making the same switch & wondered if you found a solution also, was the switch worthwhile?
i noticed your posting to &quot;elaine&quot; last year regarding a driver for canon mp730 when switching from windows to mac i am consodering the same move & wondered if you found a solution?

if you have a canon multifunction mp730 and switched to a mac, you can indeed print to it (but not fax/scan) by buying a copy of printfab  at $100 it's not cheap, but it does a great job and works reliably.
