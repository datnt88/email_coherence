i have a verizon westell adsl2 + router model a90-7500-07 combination. it has been replaced by verizon 4 times and yes it works ok when wired. if i try to connect with my iphone, ipad or book reader 1 in 10 times it connects, or randomly. i have changed settings and channels. i have turned off all security and it still doesn't connect. my question is there a modem/router that i can buy myself, say at staples that works well. verizon tells me that none will work (will not connect to their dsl) i can't imagine that being true. can anyone help me? thanks
looked at the manual for this device and it is very complex...and i am too lazy to read the whole thing. i would suspect you can run another dsl router but the dsl is not your issue it is the wireless so i would keep the dsl part since it works well on wired. so a couple suggestions you will have to dig though the manual to figure out how to do it. run the westell device as a bridge and place a second wireless router behind it. your second router will use ethernet and not dsl for its wan. you in effect use the westell box as only a modem to convert the dsl to etherent. use a second router as a wap. you can disable the wireless signal on the westel and user it to do the dsl and the routing function. your second router would only do the wireless part.
i will try this out i have another wireless router that i'll bridge in.
