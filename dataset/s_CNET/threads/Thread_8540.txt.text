i have a compaq (yr 2004) desktop and want to add and lcd monitor to it. should i upgrade the graphics card?
one step at a time upgrade?
i guess i do not have to upgrade my graphics card? i think i am going to buy the monitor and if it does not work i can return it but i was hoping someone could tell me.
pc displays are pretty much plug and use type things.
i very much doubt you'd need to do anything with the video *except* make sure to go to the compaq (or nvidia or whomever) site and make sure you have the latest driver for your graphics processor.
fwiw. i'm using a rather old video card and i suspect the op is using something older. when i went to the maker's site for my video card i found quite a list of newer drivers. as i walked my way up this list and tested i found there was a peak....perf wise. since i was not trying to fix anything......i stopped at the peak. newest drivers and old hardware might not be the best match. i agree the monitor should be pnp.
hey, if you have a desktop want to upgrade monitor for your pc then once you have to conform with the technical person who has good knowledge of computer hardware. then after your have to modify you monitor.also search in google ,it's also help you. thanks.
