hello, i am having problems getting my computer to recognize my digital camera all of a sudden - it worked just fine a few weeks ago. when i plug my usb mouse into both usb ports, it works fine. but when i try the same thing with my camera. . and palm pilot, i don't get a response when i try to synchronize. the strange thing is my computer does make a .wav sound when i try to sync the palm, it just never makes a connection. but it does recognize it. i don't have any conflicts in my hardware manager and i haven't installed anything new other than the windows xp updates. some background my my system, i'm running windows xp on a dell dimension desktop - 600 meg, 128 megs of ram. any help you can provide is greatly appreciated!
1. &quot;all of a sudden&quot; use xp's system restore if a reboot doesn't clear up such items. 2. the palm pilot is another issue. it's either related to above, the configuration/version of hotsync or you have one of the models in which the usb port gets blown out (m500?) bob
how do i do a system restore in windows xp?
just wondering. have you seen this help and support tool? bob
