<s> i just got a new core 2 quad, q9550, to replace my core 2 duo, e6600, but when i installed it there is no display on the monitor.  </s>
<s> i checked to see if i installed it right, which i did, but still no display.  </s>
<s> i have since put my old processor back, and my computer works fine.  </s>
<s> anyone know what might be wrong?  </s>
<s> most motherboards with the 945 chipset are not compatible with a q9000 series cpu.  </s>
<s> check your motherboard manufacturer's website to ensure compatibility.  </s>
<s> fixing it could be as simple as a bios update with the old cpu installed.  </s>
<s> let us know what you find.  </s>
