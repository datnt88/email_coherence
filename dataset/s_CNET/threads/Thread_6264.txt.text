finds notes that it can do this. you can turn it off in the bios. bob
to fix, start your computer and hit the del key repeatedly until bios comes up. search around till you find &quot;boot on ring.&quot; highlight it, hit enter (or whatever your bios needs to be operated) and disable. hit escape, save changes and exit. --fj
