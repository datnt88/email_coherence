i have an external hard drive which has worked fine for the pass 4 months. however, now the computer simply could not detect it. usually there would be the usb icon and autoplay on windows when i connect the hard drive, but now, nothing pops out. i have also tried to use the add hardward under the control panel icon in the start button, but the icon for the hard drive was not there. i have checked the hard drive for any obvious physical damage, but i think the hard drive works fine since i can hear it spinning inside. on the enclosure there are two leds; one marked as &quot;led&quot; and another one as &quot;r/w&quot;. usually during autoplay or when there hard drive is reading, the &quot;r/w&quot; lights would be flickering. but now, it doesn't. i am using windows xp the hard drive is a 120 gb maxtor the enclosure is a zdisk external storage from cintre (model ci-330u2) my question is this: is the hard drive or the enclosure is the problem since i can still hear and feel the hard drive is spinning but the &quot;r/w&quot; led on the enclosure is not flickering. if the enclosure is the problem, i can simply replace it. but if the hard drive is damaged, i would lose all my pictures please help me. thank you!
considering it's only xp then usb support was so-so until service pack 2 came out. why people don't install the updates is a mystery to me. if the files are important, before attempting any repair on the machine or drive, have a friend try the drive. bob
i ve tried on other ports but i havent tried to yet wit my friends. thanks for the idea. i was concerned about the leds on the enclosure. the &quot;r/w&quot; led is not blinking and usually it does when the hard drive is reading or working or wat ever it is called. is that a big problem? anasabmalek
