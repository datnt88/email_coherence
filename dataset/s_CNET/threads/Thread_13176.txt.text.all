here's my problem and no one has been able to give my an answer. 
i have a direct tv tivo box combined. 
i want to be able to watch shows recorded on another tv in the house. 
i have an 802.11b wireless network. 
how can i do this? when i got the tivo satelite box was a usb port that was &quot;for future use&quot; neither tivo or direct tv cam tell me whether they ever activated it. 
do i need another stand alone tivo, and then move the files from one to another? 
does that mean another tivo monthly service. 
how do you move the files? 
it seems with all the talk of the &quot;connected home&quot; this would be a simple and common request. 
the geek guys at best buy said yeah that's a good idea. 
but i don't know if you can do that. 
and to let them know cause they want to also. 
haven't tried this myself, but check these sites for possible info and experts: 
not sure about tivo, but replay units will talk to your computer and store movies and pictures and send them anywhere you want. 
check the tivo site there should be a software download to do this,
