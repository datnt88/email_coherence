<s> here's my problem and no one has been able to give my an answer.  </s>
<s> i have a direct tv tivo box combined.  </s>
<s> i want to be able to watch shows recorded on another tv in the house.  </s>
<s> i have an 802.11b wireless network.  </s>
<s> how can i do this? when i got the tivo satelite box was a usb port that was &quot;for future use&quot; neither tivo or direct tv cam tell me whether they ever activated it.  </s>
<s> do i need another stand alone tivo, and then move the files from one to another?  </s>
<s> does that mean another tivo monthly service.  </s>
<s> how do you move the files?  </s>
<s> it seems with all the talk of the &quot;connected home&quot; this would be a simple and common request.  </s>
<s> the geek guys at best buy said yeah that's a good idea.  </s>
<s> but i don't know if you can do that.  </s>
<s> and to let them know cause they want to also.  </s>
<s> haven't tried this myself, but check these sites for possible info and experts:  </s>
<s> not sure about tivo, but replay units will talk to your computer and store movies and pictures and send them anywhere you want.  </s>
<s> check the tivo site there should be a software download to do this,  </s>
