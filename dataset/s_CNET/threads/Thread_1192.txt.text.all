<s> several weeks ago i had to take my desktop in to get rid of malware. the desktop was the host for the router and the modem.  </s>
<s> while in the shop we continued to use the laptop with an internal wireless card.  </s>
<s> now that the host is back, the laptop get knocked off the internet.  </s>
<s> the only way to get back on is to unplug the modem for two minutes and hook it back up and then you can get on.  </s>
<s> but if it goes inot sleep mode, you have to go through the process all over again.  </s>
<s> also, it won't let me print from the laptop to the host connected printer.  </s>
<s> hi, i need some more information regarding the network: what is the model number of the modem: are u using any router : in the network: because only one computer can online with the modem at a time ; so we need to know modem is router come modem or normal modem:  </s>
<s> i will get the information for you oce i get off work today.  </s>
<s> i do know the modem came from windstream since they are our dsl provider.  </s>
<s> the router is a linksys which was installed last january.  </s>
<s> i did get the laptop reconnected to the internet.  </s>
<s> however, i took the old drivers for the printer off and reloaded them from the website.  </s>
<s> i then restarted the computer.  </s>
<s> the printer will not allow me to share even though everthing is checked to share.  </s>
<s> i did not take the firewalls down when i did this.  </s>
<s> i even tried to back door by searching for the host computer but it did not locate it.  </s>
<s> that's very odd.  </s>
<s> i wonder if something was lost in translation when you posted here.  </s>
<s> if you have a router, it doesn't need a pc to host it.  </s>
<s> somethings wrong with this post and the network as described.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i can not get the computers to ping...either from desktop or laptop and subnets are the same.  </s>
<s> i am not sure how i need to handle this issue.  </s>
<s> that's something that's proper in many systems.  </s>
<s> i can't count how many times i find a firewall set to &quot;maximum protection.&quot; the owners seem to not know what that means.  </s>
<s> back to my observation.  </s>
<s> can you write more about the router being hosted by that pc? that's a very odd statement.  </s>
