335	5	284505	2711753	2708878	cyanide176	2/22/08 3:45 pm	1.2036951e12	possible fix	sorry i didnt include more information before trying all this i updated the firmware to 1.38e do you mean assign an ip to the 360 then put that ip in the dmz? ive tried that and ended up with the same result if im thinking the wrong thing there could you please tell me how to do what you are describing? thanks,

335	7	284505	2711816	2711803	cyanide176	2/22/08 5:40 pm	1.203702e12	firewall =\	the router has a &quot;firewall rule&quot; option with vpn pass through and static rule but no option to disable the firewall. i have tried switching the cables but still no use

335	11	284505	2712397	2712395	r. proffitt	2/23/08 7:15 am	1.2037509e12	default gateway and dhcp server address is the same as my pr	default gateway and dhcp server address is the same as my primary dns server.. is this right? for some systems. what i suspect here is a dns issue. did you try the dns that your router is using?
335	12	284505	2713394	2712397	cyanide176	2/24/08 5:58 am	1.20383268e12	routers dns servers	sorry to be a pain but i dont know where to find my routers dns servers had a look about and there seems to be no mention of them
335	13	284505	2713406	2708878	r. proffitt	2/24/08 6:19 am	1.20383394e12	maybe i was unclear here.	many of these issues vanish when the router's firmware is updated. since the update did note the 360 i see no reason to continue along any other discussion path until we know we have the latest firmware or the firmware the maker's support is telling us to use. as to the dns supplied to the router i know it only seems tough. but such information is in some configuration page on the router. you must dive into these issues are just have someone come over and tackle this issue. if we leave important steps undone it's more likely to be the issue. bob
335	14	284505	3215557	2707978	viryenn	1/7/10 4:36 am	1.26283896e12	regarding gn-br01g problem	have you solved the problem yet? it seem like the same error ocurred when i try to connect xbox to live. i can still play online, ex. cod: modern warfare2- nat open: yes. but in this case i cannot join other live parties and games with spesific users/friends, thougt they can without any problems. so in a way the gn-br01g can not communicate with other routers such as linksys wrt54gl, witch works great with other users etc. i tried to forward all ports and followed description on portforward.com but still doesnt work! i also powered-off modem and router for several minutes and times. some say it will work if you can enable upnp, but i cant find where to activate it either in the router settings. please let me know if you have any idea how to solve this problem. any suggestins well be appreciated!
335	15	284505	3233296	3215557	tebass	1/27/10 2:17 pm	1.26460182e12	got mine to work	finally i got mine to work! was kinda simple. 1. i went into the xbox 360 and entered a static ip and all that. 2. in virtual server-pppoe/dhcp/static configuration settings on the router open port: 53,80,3074,88,42042,42052 for icmp and the static ip of your xbox 360. all guides i have read says i should open these ports for tcp and udp, that did not solve it for me. just figured this out and have not testes what port made it work. all games that did not work online works perfect now! right now i have all those ports open for tcp, udp and icmp.
