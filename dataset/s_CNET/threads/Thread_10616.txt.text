heres my stats compaq presario sr1610nx gpu:ati x1300 pro os: windows xp home ram:768 cpu:amd sempron processor 3200+
your machine is reviewed at  the amds use a different numbering system that confuses most of us. that 3200+ was supposed to tell you that your cpu performed &quot;like&quot; a similar intel cpu at 3.2 ghz. so far i don't see you presenting a problem and am guessing this is the usual confounder. bob
ok thanks, i get it now.
glad it helped.
