12259	13	322856	2960328	2960249	ramarc	1/23/09 7:07 am	1.23269442e12	what connectors are you using	did your card come with a double molex to 8pin plug? does your power supply have a real pci-e 8pin plug? (some 8pin plugs aren't designed for pci-e usage.) which plug are you using? if you're using the molex adapter then use molex plugs on two power supply leads (instead of two plugs on one lead). if that fails, then you should get a new sli certified powersupply in the 700w range.
