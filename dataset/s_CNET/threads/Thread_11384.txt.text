running off a laptop now, i am upgrading to a desktop (the first in years), and i am wanting to use a separate video card in conjunction with the existing video card already existing on the tower i plan to upgrade to. can someone lend me a hand with this? tower:  card:
if you want the two cards to work together or entirely separately. if you're wanting something like crossfire, i believe you need cards with matching chipsets, ram amounts, etc. someone here is probably going to say that you might want to move up to larger ps as well. in any event, tell what sort of a hand you're looking for and you'll probably get a better response than mine.
if the seller is not answering a pre-sales question imagine if you really needed help! bob
i agree with bob, the best thing is to ask them question before buying to determine who your buying from. you can go to cyberpower site and and ask questions.  a word of caution, i have never bought from these folks, i have heard good things about them and i have heard really bad things about them. do some research and check out who ever you buy from.
