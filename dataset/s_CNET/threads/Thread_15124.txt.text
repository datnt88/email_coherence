i've been recently having problems with my pc. for the past week, it's been freezing up in the middle of using it, but upon restarting it would be fine. until today that is, when i tried restarting it and it says &quot;master drive fails&quot; and &quot;slave drive fails&quot;. the master is a 40gb maxtor hd and the slave is a 250 gb western digital hd (i know, should probably switch the master and slave). anyway, i find it hard to believe that both drives would be corrupted, at least at the same time anyway. is there any way to fix this problem, or at least transfer my data to a new drive. i'd prefer not to take it to the geek squad because they charge an arm and a leg so i'd like to just do it myself if possible. any suggestions?
as to data recovery, that's so expensive that most won't get their files back. as to geek squad you usually only surrender money for them to tell you the drive has failed. go ahead if you must. again. just one drive at a time to see how that works and a new ide cable just to be sure. bob
checked the capacitors ? lot's of possibilities....why not download the mfg's diags and see what they say ? vapcmd
