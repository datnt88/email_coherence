hi, i have a machine with win xp pro running, there is nothing special with the hardware, its standard. now suddenly i cant turn the machine on, every time i press the power on button, i hear a bleep sound and the monitor stays blank. i cant even enter the machine to format it... what should i do to make a simple format? maybe it is a hardware issue regards, mirza
the beeps are a code to tell you what's wrong. now check in the motherboard manual what this particular combination of beeps (for example: 1 short one, 2 long ones) means. the usuals: - bad ram - bad cpu - bad motherboard yes, it's surely hardware. formatting doesn't make any sense. kees
ok, thanks actually it was a memory error, i changed the slots of my ram, now i'm able to start my pc but after the initial screen the monitor simply fades to black, i cant start a formatting, anything...the old win xp installation cannot be started regards, mirza
you can't format from the old win xp installation. you can only format from the xp installation cd. so it might be time to find that. kees
i have the xp cd, but the problem is when i boot from the cd during startup (first boot device set to cd rom) then the installation cannot be started, for some strange reason...
must be hardware-related. maybe still a ram issue, maybe something else. why not try memtest86 (free download) first? anyway, you're unlikely to get any effective help if you don't tell more about the issue than that it has a &quot;strange reason&quot;. kees
ok..thanks, what details do you need about the machine and the problem? regards mirza
