<s> hey, i'm doing some light upgrading.  </s>
<s> do you guys know which one of these is better?  </s>
<s> (kingston ssdnow v+200 or a-data s510) both are 60gb.  </s>
<s> i will be plugging them into my gigabyte 990fxa ud3.  </s>
<s> since you only asked which is better that could mean by price or small file performance, big file performance, small or big file read write times or something else entirely.  </s>
<s> i suggest you find some storage site review and maybe it's just the price.  </s>
<s> however if this is on an older than windows 7 os i'd not do this.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have a kingston v+200 240 gig ssd on a windows 7 computer and it is crazy fast and stable.  </s>
<s> a friend tried that same model ssd on a windows vista machine and it was a total disaster, nothing but trouble.  </s>
<s> he did a clean install of windows 7 on that same computer, reinstalled the ssd and cloned the harddrive to the ssd and it works great.  </s>
