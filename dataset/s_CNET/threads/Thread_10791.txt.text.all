3 times this weekend my computer had the blue screen on it saying it was dumping the physical memory. 
nobody was using it, i just saw the message as i was walking by. the first 2 times i rebooted, it started up normally. the 3rd time it gave me a ''harddrive not found'' error. 
i am using xp sp2. the hard drive is less than 6 months old. 
i don't have any extra hard drives, just a cd-rom & a 3'' floppy. 
any help would be greatly appreciated. 
what happened immediately before the memory dump, did you download/install anything? 
were you connected to the internet? 
otherwise check your physical connections, power and ide (if relevent), then go to the bios on boot and see if the primary device is recognised. 
i checked the connections, but everything looked alright. 
when i tried a different plug in, it started working just find. 
thank god it was something easy. 
thank you very much.
