nic is found in hardware manager, says is operating fine, but it doesn't show up in network connections window. the amber light is on and i cannot ping any address, it just times out. i am thinking the onboard nic might be bad. what do you guys think?
see if you have an ip address. adding a nic doesn't automatically create a network connection. there are a lot of missing pieces here. can you provide more details?
there are lots of things that can cause this. one easy thing you could try is to right click the network connection and click repair. that will release network settings, obtain new ones and flush the dns and arp cache. i have seen that work and also not work, but it's a start.
