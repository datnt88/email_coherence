hi, i'm trying to help my roommate with his computer, but i need some help figuring out what's wrong with it. i don't know all the specs, but it's got a p4 and has been working acceptably up until now. this morning he tried to turn it on and it wouldn't boot. i've opened it up, and a green led on the mobo is lit whenever the computer is plugged in, which makes me wonder if the psu is ok. when i try to turn on the computer the cpu's heatsink fan spins for a second, and then stops, which also seems to indicate that it's getting power. the psu fan does the same thing: spins for a second and then stops. if i hit the power button after that nothing happens. if i unplug the computer for a few seconds the led will go out, and when i plug it back in and hit the power button the fans will again spin for a second and then stop. the fact that at least some juice seems to be flowing makes me wonder if the mobo, not the psu, is the problem. any advice would be greatly appreciated. jason
ok, this is really weird: it occurred to me that the power cord might be faulty, so i replaced it with one of my power cords, and it booted up fine. i unplugged it, put the old cord back, and now it's working fine again. what in the world does this mean?
it happened again; the fans will spin when the power button is pressed, but it won't start. is there any way to figure out what the problem is without buying a new psu to try out? i could really use some help with this.
psus fail in all different ways. some go snap, crackle and pop, some die a slow stuttering death. the first step is to swap it out and see if the problem disappears.
i'm having a similar problem - system starts to power up, and then shuts itself off after 2 or 3 seconds. i have tried using a psu from another case and still no joy. could this be a bad connection or a bad cooling fan for the cpu or something else that i can check? thanks!
