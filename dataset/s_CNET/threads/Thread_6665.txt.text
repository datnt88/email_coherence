i have a problem with our wireless internet i have network downstairs and the kids have wireless upstairs and every time the phone ring (wireless phone) or some get on the phone they get bumped off what can i do about that besides get a corded one? jay
it's a common issue. try channels 1, 6 then 12, then you have to change out the cordless phone for another frequency. 900mhz works fine. bob
try channel 1,6,12 on what on the wireless pc slot or the phone.our phone is 2.4ghz
just read the manuals. bob
