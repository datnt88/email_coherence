<s> i am guessing you are a dsl user.  </s>
<s> dsl usually uses pppoe software (ppp over ethernet).  </s>
<s> this gives you a login prompt using ppp.  </s>
<s> pppoe is considered a tunnel protocol.  </s>
<s> you seem to have multiple virtual adapters when you should only have 1. try to uninstall your the software your isp gave you and delete all of those virtual adapters.  </s>
<s> then reboot the computer and reinstall the software.  </s>
<s> or, buy a router for $50 and let it do the pppoe for you.  </s>
<s> you will benefit with a small performance increase and some security.  </s>
<s> worms and hackers will be probing the router instead of your pc. if you buy a router you will not need the isp software any more.  </s>

<s> thanks skrall a lot!! sorry... i was not very specific... yes i have dsl and i do have a router!!! actually we have 2 computers... and the other one that is connected &quot;with wire (lan cable)&quot; to the router, has no problems at all... mine was connected wireless... and had no problems at all too!! now i disconnected the other pc and i trying to make the laptop work &quot;with wire (lan cable)&quot;.  </s>
<s> (at the beginning i thought it might be the wireless card, even though the computer receives perfect signal!!!) i don-t know.... anyway... i think my isp didn-t give me any software, could that be? the sw i installed was the one of the router... lynksys... thanks again!! please let me know if you thinks is something else!!! ps. why i have virtually adapters??  </s>
<s> i had kind of the same problem and somebody told me to check if my connection was bridged.  </s>
<s> it was.  </s>
<s> so i unbridged the connection and voila!  </s>
<s> i hope it helps.  </s>
<s> by the way,i don't know anything about computers, i'm just &quot;brave&quot; and try to fix them.  </s>
<s> hi!! thanks for the tip... but what is that the connection is bridged?? how can i &quot;unbrigdged&quot;? thanks a lot!! maria  </s>
<s> go to show all my connections.  </s>
<s> look to see if the connection that you are using to connect to the internet is bridged.  </s>
<s> normally it will say the name of the connection, the next line will tell you if is connected or not, followed for the word &quot;bridged&quot; or &quot;firewalled.&quot; if you see the word &quot;bridge&quot;, right click and look for &quot;unbridge connection.&quot;  </s>
<s> click on it and the connection should unbridged by itself.  </s>
<s> good luck!  </s>
