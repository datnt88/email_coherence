<s> to enter the bios.  </s>
<s> if that isn't possible because you really screwed it up, check your motherboard manual on how to manually reset it via jumpers on the motherboard.  </s>
<s> may i remark that it is not clear from your post what exactly you changed, let alone why you changed it.  </s>

<s> changes to the bios don't keep for these reasons either they're way off(oc'ing?) or not saved upon exiting the bios area.  </s>
<s> if the problem persists, then be sure the bios/cmos battery is ok, just put in a new one.  </s>
<s> a p4 system is a dated system as your post offers no real info, i can suspect you're rebuilding from old parts or re-using some.  </s>
<s> do that and check results.  </s>
<s> for more detailed help, post your system specs.  </s>

<s> my understanding of the description -- not getting to bios at all, i.e. failing to post even.  </s>
<s> if that's true, then the problem is hardware, not the os. strip down (unplug everything except 1 stick of ram, cpu, psu, and video) and test the usual culprits.  </s>
<s> if needed, the motherboard should have a couple pins you jumper together to reset the cmos or something similar to get back to default bios.  </s>
<s> no disrespect intended, but might get better help from a forum in one's native language.  </s>
