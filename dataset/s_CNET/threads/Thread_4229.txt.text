i am in the process of buying a new computer and i cant decide on the name brand or any. i have an ibm aptiva 2170-831 it still in good condition, but some of my dll files i have lost somewhere. what do you guys think. do i need to do buy or upgrade. h-e-l-p thank you,
its always cheaper to buy individual parts and pop them in your old case. a typical upgrade would be getting a new mobo/cpu, more ram, and maybe a bigger hard drive. if your a gamer a new video card is always a must.  seems to have the best deals on parts.
dll/'s are software files. perhaps you just need for do a repair install of the software. better yet, format the drive, then do a clean install. if the machine is satisfactory and the dll issue is the only problem, this can be repaired.
