6149	14	312400	2883732	2883688	theblackred	10/16/08 6:20 pm	1.2241812e12	lol	oh lol. found the solution on some european world of warcraft forum. apparently there's some glitch with the .exe file intel's update uses that makes vista unhappy. so i had to download the zip file for the 945gm driver, and then tell the driver to update from a disk, but actually find the place where i extracted the zip file to and say that's where it should update from. specifically a .inf file in the extracted updater. tricky. so yeah nothing wrong with driver or hardware or anything. just vista + intel = stupid. the forum was  if anyone wants to read up on it more. so yay happy ending. my video driver is now up-to-date. thanks for your effort and patience rob.
