hello all. i've been using windows for years now and i have always pushed the macintosh aside; more out of fear of being lost without windows, even though deep down i've always known that they work better and usually get the job done quicker. ever since primary school (and hence system 7/ mac os 8) i have always dreamed of having mac, but i have sufficed with windows 95, 2000 and xp, and i do like those oses to a certain degree. i'm now seriously thinking of upgrading (i'll explain why i used that term in a minute) to mac os x. now, am i correct in saying that i can just go out, buy panther/leopard or whatever, and stick it on my windows laptop? it only has an external cd drive, and not much memory, but i can take care of the memory. could i run windows 2000 or xp beside the macintosh os too? the reason i referred to this as upgrading is because in my opinion that macintosh has always been superior to windows however i still do disagree with a lot of the rife anti-competitive-ness. of course, if apple were the microsoft of today, we'd all hate them instead, but the fact is, we don't, and, their machines are more technologically advanced. have you seen these things? they practically manage themselves, hell, maybe it'll even order itself to my door!! seriously though, i hope that anyone can give me a pointer as to what i should do - buy a mac altogether and stuff windows, or do both? thanks.
its purely a matter of preferance and both have big advantages over the other. apples new commercials are entirely misleading but we all know pcs aren't perfect either. what do you use the computer for?
i use the computer for the above, and not really much more. of course my priority right now is not to get a mac, in fact it's probably the bottom of my list as i'd rather spend my money on clothes, going out etc but i was just looking for some rough guidelines.
if u want media go for mac, gaming for pc, that simple
