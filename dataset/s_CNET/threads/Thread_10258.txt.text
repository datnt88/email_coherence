my daughter download a background picture to my desktop which replaced my original picture. after changing the image back to the original all seemed ok till i closed down my computer. as it was going through the process of closing down,the image was flashed on the screen instead of the blue screen i normally see. now as i start up my computer the image shows up as background for the start up process and shut down process, how do i remove this image from my system?? the image does not show up as a background pic in my control panel for the display. i'm using win2000 pro
for the file name and delete it.
reboot, change it again, reboot and most of the time it will go away.
thank you for your help problem solved
