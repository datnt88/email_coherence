(long story.) he finally took it to his shop to finish the work, and now says that windows xp has &quot;crashed&quot; and he needs her recovery disk which she does not have. (no cds came with it--just &quot;hidden partition.&quot;) i've read here that she can order them from hp; but i'm wondering if i can make one on my pc (ours are exactly the same) to give to the tech to use on hers? you people who answer questions from novices like me are absolutely terrific. i look forward once again to your recommendations and advice. thanks! ellie howe

(yes, i back up fanatically! learned my lesson years ago.) i went to the hp support section of my hard drive and could not find detailed instructions of exactly how to make the recovery cd or cds. can anyone tell me how to do it--or simply point me to a web site that will give me detailed instructions? i tried microsoft's web site but could not find the instructions there either... thanks again! ellie

10256	8	112460	1281153	1278303	alan copeland	7/5/05 3:08 pm	1.12057608e12	here is the link to hp	with all you need to know about creating your disks.  once you select your language you will be taken to a page with muliple links for all aspects of the process. i recommend that you print each one out before beginning.
10256	9	112460	1281416	1281153	elliehowe	7/5/05 7:17 pm	1.12059102e12	you're the best!	alan! thanks so much for finding this link and sending it to me! i had been searching all over the microsoft web site with no luck; i hadn't thought to search hp. i am printing all of it as we speak...and will let you know how i make out. it sounds pretty easy! thanks again! ellie
10256	10	112460	1281428	1281416	alan copeland	7/5/05 7:25 pm	1.1205915e12	i am just sorry	taht i couldn't find it sooner. i knew i had an email from hp, but i had put it in the wrong folder, and found it by accident tonight. remember that this is hp information; microsoft would not have a clue how to restore a pc. best of luck.
