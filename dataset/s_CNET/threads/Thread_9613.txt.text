i have netgear wireless router. i want to host one web application on my system which is having internal ip as 198.162.*.* and my external ip is static ip address. i have installed a web application (using websphere app server) using my external ip adress as host name is not working. i can access my pages from my machine using host name as localhost or my internal ip address. what can i do to access my website from outside?
put the server pc into the dmz.
what the dmz is and how to put server pc in dmz? i may be asking very basic question...
google the new question.... &quot;what the dmz is and how to put server pc in dmz?&quot; (at google)
thanks a lot! i did it and it worked.....
sorry if i seemed to try to keep it short. it's like you know what word you want but can't find it in the dictionary so just the clue is all that is needed.
