it seems i've read a million blogs, reviews, etc. etc. about mac's being the best for graphic designers. and i would more than likely concur with this statement, but what about the other design professions out there. 3d-graphics, modellers, game designers, furniture and industrial design, architects, interior designers....and the list goes on. any thoughts anyone?
to this day my decision is not to debate it but use what pays off. if my job supplies a mac, i use that, if not i use the other. seems like the old story of an artist blaming the tools. bob
i, too am a graphic designer and i prefer windows. it just works, apple is making false claims about windows crashing and not doing things you want it to. i know many other graphic designers who hate their apples because they aren't compatible with all the windows printers and stuff. plus, they crash more than windows. macs are designed to be simple, in fact, way too simple. so simple, you have less customization. i use adobe cs2, on windows and it runs great, i never have issues.
