<s> i'm going to be building a new system and have about $1200 to spend.  </s>
<s> here's what i've got so far.  </s>
<s> please feel free to voice whatever opinions you may have on what i'm throwing together here.  </s>
<s> my last two things to buy are the p4 and the case.  </s>
<s> any recommendations?  </s>
<s> 1.) asus p5ad2-e premium socket t (lga 775) intel 925xe 2.) corsair valueselect 1gb (2 x 512mb) ddr2-533 (pc2-4200) 3.) (two)western digital raptor wd740gd 73 gb 10,000 rpm hard drive 4.) ati radeon x700pro 256mb gddr3 pci-express x16 video card 5.) thermaltake silent purepower w0014 (black) atx 480w power supply 6.) atech pro-9 black 11-in-1 ieee1394 and usb2.0 internal/ external card reader 7.) nec nd-3520a black ide dvd burner please let me know what you see as bottlenecks or future issues to deal with.  </s>
<s> after the above i don't have a ton of dough left over to spend on the chip.  </s>
<s> i haven't built a system since my 1999 piii 500, i'm having to learn a few new things.  </s>

<s> you usually want to design a system around the cpu you are going to use.  </s>
<s> since you say you are very limited on what you can spend now because of the other peripheral devices on your list, i would go back and reevaluate this first.  </s>
<s> then you would add your peripheral devices last. the motherboard you have chosen looks excellent.  </s>
<s> keep in mind that it only has 3 pci slots and would be limited for expansion in that area. it all depends on what cards you want to add in the future.  </s>
<s> if you are a hard core gamer, you might want to consider more memory on the video card, depending on what games you are planning to use.  </s>
<s> 512mb cards are out there but cost a lot.  </s>
<s> make sure your cas rating on the memory is 2.0 for the best performance and make sure that it is a matched pair for your dual channel ddr to function properly.  </s>
<s> an excellent case to consider is the lian li case line.  </s>
<s> they are very well made and you will be pleased with how easy they are to work with.  </s>
<s> i see no other bottlenecks in what you have posted.  </s>
<s> it may not have the correct connector for the mobo main power plug.  </s>
<s> see this link for some more info.:  </s>
<s> in the hardware forum: .  </s>
<s> good points.  </s>
<s> i left the chip for last and it looks like i'll have to increase my budget by about 300 bucks in order to get a p4 650 3.4.  </s>
<s> the graphics card will have to stay in the 256 range for the time being.  </s>
<s> i'm also mainly going to be doing video editing on this system.  </s>
<s> any other suggestions with this in mind?  </s>
<s> pci slots could be an issue at some point as well in the future.  </s>
<s> i guess a new mobo in a couple years would fix that.  </s>
<s> the pci slots should not be an issue in the future. the asus photo shows you are getting a mobo with: 1- pci-express x16 (for the video card) 2- pci-express x1 (small white bus) some mobo's with x1 &quot;express pci technology&quot; only have one instead of 2. 3- pci (regular standard large white bus). the pci-express is the wave of the future, and look for more mobo's to have less regular pci as time goes on.  </s>
<s> i don't see you having to get a new mobo for some time (years). the cheapest p4 650 3.4ghz is $411 at pricewatch.  </s>
<s> newegg is $419.  </s>
<s> don't forget $'s for a case, and the winxp operating system...home complete $187, or pro full version $276 please see my post at the hardware forum suggesting you might want to look at monarch building it for you for $49.  </s>
<s> why go thru the hassle of doing something wrong, or time if you are short of,or headache's ... with no warranty other than what you get along with parts purchase.  </s>
