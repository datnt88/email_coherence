i currently have a dell dimension 8250. my current specs are as follow... processor: intel(r) pentium(r) 4 cpu 2.40ghz memory (ram): 256 mb hard drive: 80 gb (in reality, 74.49...) video card: 128 ddr ati radeon 9700 tx w/tv-out interestingly, i had no problem playing splinter cell 3 on this machine. however, when i tried to play far cry, the game loaded fine (slowly albeit) but the colors and shapes were...well, crazy; hard to explain. the colors were fine, but it was like looking through a kaleidoscope. am i making any sense? i think i am going to up my memory to 512 mb. can i upgrade my graphics card? will either of these upgrades void my warranty? when i purchased the computer, i settled on the extended warranty, and i still have 280 some days left before it runs out. any insight is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!
yes it will void your warranty.
yes the upgrades will void your warranty, but only to a point. the new hardware will not be covered, but if you have a problem, you can restore the original configuration to have the unit serviced. (put the old video card back in & remove the new memory.) as for upgrading the memory, i hope you have deep pockets because the dimension 8250 used rdram which is very expensive. rdram memory sticks must be installed in matching pairs and 2 sticks of 256mb is currently running between $200 and $250. good luck.
well, it seems that i have come to a dead end...thanks to both of you for your insight. it looks as though i might just hold off on upgrading and go ahead with building my own system after all. again, many thanks for your help!
rather than pour money down the drain with an obselete system
