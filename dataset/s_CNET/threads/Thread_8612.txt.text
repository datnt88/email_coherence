i have a media center pc with a tv tuner card and an ati radeon x600 pro graphics card. i also have a 19&quot; lcd flat panel display. my question is if i use an hd tuner box from comcast for my cable tv and i run the coaxial cable into the pc, will i be able to watch hdtv through the media center app?
media center pcs only support broadcast hd, but there are graphics cards from ati that support hd.
ati hd wonder is an ota atsc tuner not quam (cable hd tuner). john
yes, only ota cards seem to be available right now. the question really is if i have an hd tuner from my cable provider (comcast) and just rout the decoded output to my tv tuner card in my mc, will it be able to handle it and push it to the graphics card, an ati radeon x600, and then render it on my monitor, a 19 inch lcd that should have more than enough resolution?
