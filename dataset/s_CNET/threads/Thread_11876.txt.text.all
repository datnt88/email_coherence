<s> the amd hd9600wcgdbox phenom 9600 quad core processor is about $20 more than the amd hd9600wcj4bgd phenom 9600 quad core processor.  </s>
<s> i was looking the specs for each and they are both the same. is there a difference between the 2 besides the part numbers?  </s>
<s> the oem part will not come with a heatsink/fan.  </s>
<s> the other 'retail', then another difference is product warranty.  </s>
<s> warranty on oem products is from the retailer/seller and is usually whatever the retailer/seller provides ...30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc.,. on the otherhand, retail boxed cpus whether intel or amd, usually have 3 year warranties from the manufacturer.  </s>
<s> my recommendation, get a retail boxed cpu which gives you the hs fan and the longer 'manufacturer-backed' warranty.  </s>
