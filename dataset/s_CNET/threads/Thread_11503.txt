(just incase you want take a look:  ) there are 4 led lights attached to this extender. 3 of them are lighting, but the 4th won't light at all. led's:  i did the exact same procedures as exampled in the installation manual, but nothing worked. i always got this error on the end of the unsuccesful installation: move the extender closer to the existing router or gateway. im really sure the extender is in the range of my actual router! i've tried everything from restoring to factory defaults to wps, dps, disabling security, nothing works.. i always get stuck on the error. (with wps i press both the buttons on the extender and the router, but they cant find each other.) i hope someone can help me. thanks!
