amateur here and any help would be appreciated. i have a gateway computer (about a year and a half old) running xp with a lcd flat screen monitor. all was well until today when, after the computer had been on &quot;stand by&quot; mode, the monitor failed to automatically come on when i started the computer up again. i turned off the power button to the monitor, then turned it back on again and received the message, &quot;no signal&quot;. after checking to see if the connections were all secure, i restarted the computer (not just &quot;stand by&quot;) and the monitor came on as normal. i tried &quot;stand by&quot; again with the same &quot;no signal&quot; results. i'm at a loss. don't know if this means i need a new graphics card or perhaps to at least check if it is seated correctly. any help would be appreciated.
the monitor has a low power state activated and deactivated by the video card. either the card is not sending the signal or the monitor is not responding. swap one or the other for a test.
thanks much, cory. i'll give a shot to swapping the monitor out first. hopefully, by process of elimination, i'll have a culprit at that time. will probably take me a few days to get to it though.
