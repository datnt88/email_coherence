hi, firstly, i dont know a great deal about wireless ! i have a netgear mr814 v 3 router, my sones pc and partners lap top see the connection and signal strengh is good. though they are sending packets none are being recived. i really do now know what i need to do, this is driving me mad....as such i would appreciate any help or guidance. many thanks
has this configuration ever worked? what type of internet connection? spyware and virus free? the possibilities are endless.
no spyware running....os is xp...broadband internet with ethernet adaptor on main pc. all systmes see it but none are receeving packets. i have disabled the firewall as well....not sure to be honest. shame my pc did not come with a one button fix all !
require you to enter the user name and password from the isp into the routers setup page. other isps will give you a modem/router to use and when adding another router you may need to adjust the isp's modem/router's settings. so without more information being given, only guesses can be made. does the internet work when connecting the modem directlt to a pc?
powerline networking
