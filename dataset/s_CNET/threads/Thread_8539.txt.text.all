<s> i was considering getting a intel quad core computer then some one asked if i really needed that much power when most programs barely use more than a single core let alone a dual core.  </s>
<s> so i was thinking i should just go with a dual core chip with the best graphics card i can get. the things is i have been doing a lot of reading and i wanted to find out which of the dual cores are the best for intel and for amd. then from those chips which is considered the fastest and best for games movies and music.  </s>

<s> as to why i'm going to skip that and point to tomshardware.com as he's all over it.  </s>
<s> check out ibuypower.com if you know what you want in a computer and don't want to overpay, if you not sure you'll end up paying hp $600+ for 8gb ddr2-800mhz dual channel sdram (4x2048) when you can get better quality ram from newegg for less then $300 ( ) not that you'd need that much, thats just proving a point.  </s>
<s> do research on your parts and know how much they are worth before buying from one of the big companies.  </s>
<s> or just build it yourself, its usually the best option.  </s>
<s> amd's fastest dual core is the athlon x2 6400+ intel's is the core 2 duo e6850 or the e8400 (65nm and 45nm)  </s>
