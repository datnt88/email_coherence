<s> hello, i have 4 laptops (3 vista and one xp), and a netgear wgr614 (it came with the virgin connection).  </s>
<s> i wanna play counterstrike by connecting all the four laptops wireless.  </s>
<s> please tell me how to connect all the laptops for gameplay.  </s>
<s> a step-by-step instruction would be very helpful as i'm not an expert with computers.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> air space is shared space and the impact of more than one machine on the air is just a bad idea that no one should entertain.  </s>
<s> how about 4 routers and configured like post 17 in our forum sticky?  </s>
<s> this way each machine gets it's own wifi connection all to itself!  </s>

<s> ok, so are you saying that too many computers on wifi is a bad idea because of the radiation?  </s>
<s> i'm sorry if i understood it wrongly.  </s>
<s> also, if its possible, could you help me to set-up a lan with the stuff which i already have?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> this is not an issue of too many users.  </s>
<s> what you may just be learning about is how wifi works.  </s>
<s> sure, what you asked can work but the gamers would grumble about ping times and the gamer with the wired connection would have the edge.  </s>
<s> i offered a solution to that.  </s>
<s> :could you help me to set-up a lan with the stuff which i already have?: sure, just do what the manuals told you to do.  </s>
