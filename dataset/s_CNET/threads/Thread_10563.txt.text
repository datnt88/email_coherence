i am using a tsstcorp cdrw/dvd sh-m522c (combo drive, samsung). my software is incd 4.2 and nero express 6. for the past few weeks i have been unable to burn on cdrs. i keep getting a burn process failed message. i've tried using different cdr brands (verbatim, sony, imation, kodak etc) to no avail. the drive can still play dvds, read and write on cd-rws. the only function that isn't working is the burning process. sys specs: winxp, 256 ram 20gb hd 64 ram vid card p 4 1.7 ghz thanks,
i'd swap the drive out and retest. bob
whenever i burn a cd windows will burn the first cd, naming it today's date. but when i try to burn a second cd it'll fail unless i rename it something other than today's date.
