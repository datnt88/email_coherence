so i recently upgraded my computer and i know for sure it meets a lot of the requirements for a lot of games, the minimum, some are maximum, but some of thse games still run slow. i want to know why. my computer meets the sysreq for crysis but it only runs at 16 fps. i have everything on low, and my resolution at 1024x768 specs: manufacturer: asustek computer inc. processor: intel(r) core(tm) i5 cpu 650 @ 3.20ghz (4 cpus), ~3.2ghz memory: 8192mb ram hard drive: 989 gb video card: nvidia geforce gtx 460 1gb gddr5
maybe the drivers for the devices are having a problem with the games. the hardware appears to be adequate. first one to try is the graphics. go to the nvidia site and let the autocheck look at the video driver. since no mention of which os, check on the motherboard drivers at the asus site for drivers matching the os installed. if none of that helps, check on user forums for the games you play to see if others are having problems with the hardware you have in place.
i've lost count of poorly planned windows installs. how many times have you asked for the &quot;install plan&quot; and you read replies that are incomplete? get together with this machine's designer or vendor and make that plan. bob
i did this the other day, everything's up to date.
it's a recurring issue where i find folk forgetting some software that matters.
