<s> sorry for the long post but here it goes.  </s>
<s> i have a pre-existing ethernet network with three computers attached sharing one dsl connection with an empty ethernet port available on my router.  </s>
<s> i also have an hdtv.  </s>
<s> my primary computer runs mce 2005 but does not have a pvr or tv tuner.  </s>
<s> i have been reading very intently on a very interesting setup for home networking. it uses the power system already in your home.  </s>
<s> you connect a device (computer, router, etc.) to a powerline-network adapter via ethernet and then connect the power cable into a power outlet.  </s>
<s> you then connect another device in the same way.  </s>
<s> this creates a good connection from anywhere in your house.  </s>
<s> i have also heard a lot about people buying &quot;digital media adapters&quot; which let you hook it up to a tv/stereo and connect to the network via ethernet.  </s>
<s> then you can share your photos, video, music, etc. on your hdtv.  </s>
<s> my goal is to use the powerline networking method i described to connect my router to the digital media adapter.  </s>
<s> my main question is, &quot;will this work?&quot;  </s>
<s> here is a link to cnet's article: my next question is what digital media &quot;device(s)&quot; would i need to buy in order to send my (hd)tv signals over this said network so i could watch them and save them on my main computer(the one running mce 2005 w/o a tv tuner/pvr)?  </s>
<s> i assume i would need to buy one of the digital media adapters that has hd inputs so it could send hd video to the network.  </s>
<s> is it even possible to send hd video to the computer using this networking option?  </s>
<s> thanks for bearing through with my long post.  </s>
<s> i would really appreciate your help... thanks!  </s>
<s> p.s. if any more info is needed, please ask!  </s>
<s> this setup will replace the cat5/6 cable or wireless configuration.  </s>
<s> from my point of view, it's convience but expensive (in other word..no big deal).  </s>
<s> it is impossible for me to run an ethernet cable all across the house, i think this is exactly what i need. the $50 adapter would suffice for me but do you if this whole setup would work?  </s>
<s> i.e. hdtv signal to computer via network, connect the adapter to the tv/stereo system itself?  </s>
<s> thanks for your input.  </s>
