<s> hello everyone!  </s>
<s> i am having an issue with sharing printers.  </s>
<s> i have a vista desktop, vista laptop, and xp desktop; the main source being the vista desktop (where the network is established).  </s>
<s> i run vista home 32-bit on both the laptop and desktop, and the xp is the home edition as well (sp2).  </s>
<s> the vista laptop can see and share files/printers with the vista desktop, and the xp desktop can see the network from the vista desktop, but cannot see/locate any of the shared printers.  </s>
<s> i've pinged each desktop ip address to the other desktop; i've made certain all of the workgroups were titled the same; it's not a firewall issue; and i've tried every other option listed on every forum i've come across the last 3 days, and still nothing.  </s>
<s> i've even attepted to reset the router and start from scratch, with no help there, either.  </s>
<s> can someone help me, please?  </s>
<s> if any other system/program information is needed to be supplied, please do not hesitate to ask; i need to get this established and running asap, as i run a business from home.  </s>
<s> thank you very much!  </s>

<s> i can't tell if you installed the lltd.  </s>
<s> 2. read another discussion underway at pay attention to post 4. bob  </s>
<s> bob - yes, the file and printer sharing are both marked 'on'.  </s>
<s> this may sound dumb, but what is lltd?  </s>
<s> i'm still learning how to set all of this up, and that's something i've not come across as of yet.  </s>
<s> thank you!  </s>
<s> noted in our forum sticky and at google.com.  </s>
<s> sorry but it's a common item so let's do a little research.  </s>
