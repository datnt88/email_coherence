asus a8v deluxe mb latest bios am getting a 30 second delay black screen from time ide check screen exits until xp starts. i reset the bios by pulling power plug, removing battery and resetting jumpers as per book. still getting same delay. machine runs fine after booting. btw, there is no such delay if i boot from cd. any ideas as to where i should begin?
try the cmos boot order to be the hard disk first.
thanks bob. glad to see you're still helping in the forums. been awhile since i was here. i'm beginning to think there may be an incorrect raid setting, even though i'm not using raid. the via raid driver is installed, and i can access raid through bios, but for some reason i can't change any settings. i'll get back to you if i find whats happening with the raid controller.
some boards have a delay meant for external devices such as usb drives to spin up so they can be detected. look for this.
hadn't thought of that! i'll give it a look, and if i find anything wrong there, i'll get back to you.
tried every bios setting for usb delay, and none made a difference. thanks for the idea. i'm going to flash back to my original mb shipping bios and see if that corrects the problem. again, thanks.
if you are using xp, it's possible you have the delay set there. look in the advanced section of your startup/recovery options. you can view the boot loader by hitting the &quot;edit&quot; button. see if it mentions a delay time.
thanks again steven. everything there compares to my other machine, but i changed the settings around, but to no avail. however, your post got me to thinking that maybe some other software is messing with things. i am using &quot;xp smoker&quot;, so i am going to do an uninstall there and see what happens. have a good one. ken
