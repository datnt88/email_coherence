greetings forum. i'm building my own media center computer. i started out with an old hp vectra vli8 desktop system. i put in a bigger cpu (1.3ghz celeron), increased the ram(512mb), put in a 300gb hard drive, i also installed a hauppauge dual-tuner card wintv-pvr-mce-500, upgraded to a hp dvd840i dvd writer(dl + lightscribe), and to cap it off, i changed the operating system to windows media center 2005 sp2. i am at my vertical limit with this problem. can you tell me how to install the driver software for the hp dvd840i super multi dvd writer? i can't burn the programs i've saved on my hard drive to dvd until i clear this up.
but we do install dvd recording software. i use cdburnerxp a lot. bob
did you get your burner to work? i replaced the cd burner with hp dvd840ri and now my 2004 compaq presario s5200nx (2.7ghz processor, 512mb memory,120gb hard drive) thinks the dvd burner is a cd burner.i have xp home.i've tried everything short of a different burner. i don't like the nero program and want to use dvd architect. any suggestions?
