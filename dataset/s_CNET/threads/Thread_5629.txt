8736	5	90059	1012820	1012683	r. proffitt	3/3/05 10:50 am	1.109847e12	pinging almost always works.	the firewall blocks sharing or browsing so you have to rip the firewall out or learn how to allow/trust your network. nbt or netbios over tcp/ip should be enabled by default. if you research how the stock sharing over tcp/ip works, you'll run into this. bob

8736	8	90059	1014131	1013264	rpreske	3/3/05 8:00 pm	1.10988e12	almost working!	well, thanks for all the help guys ... the firewall was modified to only allow my two computers to be in the trusted zone. i attempted pinging each to the other pc and it was successful. however, now, i can see only my workgroup computer for the me machine only on the me machine and the shared folders i set up. but, on xp, no folders at all when i try to view the workgroup, not even the xp machine is shown. instead, i get an error like &quot;can't access, not allowed to see computers on this network..&quot; or something like that. is that due to not allowing ptp networking? if so, should i try the above fix? thanks.
8736	9	90059	1016842	1013264	enable123	3/4/05 4:03 pm	1.10995218e12	the problem with ics	is when you try to share the the internet connection, your computers become a part two totally different networks. you may share folders when you are on the same network. i believe one of your computers is getting its address from your dsl connection on one nic, and the other nic crossed over to the other computer, when internet connection sharing is enabled, is setting a default address of 192.168.0.1 which is typical of windows. your computer with two nics is a part of the dhcp enabled network and your other computer is a part of another network created when you enabled ics. two totally different networks, but your second computer can now have internet access. you just sacrifice the sharing abilities. get a router with a four port switch and your problems are solved. both will share printer and files and internet connection and the router becomes additional defense to others attempting to access or &quot;see&quot; your local network and computers. a kind of hardware firewall.

(in windows me, tcp/ip should be 'binding' to client microsoft network and file and printer sharing)-- (in stand alone win 9x/me, this should be unbind). again its only a few thought...
