i am an avid gamer in my spare time, as most of you likely know latency(ping) is a major factor in online gaming. recently i noticed my ping has doubled and tripled to some gaming servers including ones located only about 150 miles away. i also noticed the most change in servers that were very close by. a ping test to a server not 30 miles away had shown my ping had jumped from the normal 20-30ms to 90-110ms overnight. so i did all the basics, reset and reconfigured my router, made sure i didn't have an emi issue. nothing worked, so i did a tracert. the results are weird, my isp is using a route clear on the other side of the states from me starting at hop 4. i live in north florida, iptrace shows this to be in minnesota. ideas on the cause and how i might fix this? haven't had the chance to contact my isp yet and i get a sneaking feeling that contacting them won't be much help anyway. tracert results below. 2 14 ms 14 ms 17 ms 69-57-112-1.nefcom.net [69.57.112.1] 3 12 ms 14 ms 14 ms 67-223-195-94.nefcom.net [67.223.195.94] 4 102 ms 234 ms 218 ms zen-townes-jkvlfl-421.mgmt.zayoms.net [137.192.5 2.93] 5 73 ms 68 ms 70 ms plmomncdpe0-te0-0-0-1-76.mgmt.onvoy.net [137.192 .52.46] 6 67 ms 111 ms 68 ms xe-4-1-0.mpr1.msp2.us.above.net [208.184.236.229 ] 7 72 ms 69 ms 70 ms xe-4-0-0.mpr1.msp1.us.above.net [64.125.21.46] 8 73 ms 70 ms 73 ms ae3.cr1.ord2.us.above.net [64.125.20.78] 9 85 ms 96 ms 74 ms ae5.cr2.ord2.us.above.net [64.125.28.234] 10 74 ms 71 ms 72 ms ae4.er2.ord7.us.above.net [64.125.20.42] 11 103 ms 104 ms 102 ms te0-5-0-24.ccr21.ord03.atlas.cogentco.com [154.5 4.10.197] 12 108 ms 105 ms 108 ms be2003.ccr22.ord01.atlas.cogentco.com [154.54.29 .21] 13 71 ms 68 ms 78 ms be2099.ccr22.atl01.atlas.cogentco.com [154.54.28 .74] 14 72 ms 74 ms 74 ms te4-1.ccr01.clt01.atlas.cogentco.com [154.54.84. 238] 15 88 ms 84 ms 84 ms te4-2.ccr01.rdu01.atlas.cogentco.com [154.54.80. 58] 16 90 ms 86 ms 84 ms 38.122.176.2 17 87 ms 84 ms 84 ms 137.118.63.254 18 85 ms 83 ms 84 ms hosting.nefcom.net [137.118.32.27] trace complete.
i just realized i posted this in the wrong section i think, sorry about that. pretty tired, i just got home from work and am rather new to this board. if a mod could move it to the appropriate forum i would appreciate it.
sorry but when i talk to gamers we get them wired, turn off the wifi and never share the connection. we may even remove a router. and in parting with netflix hitting an all time high in use, lags are hitting new highs too. bob
in reply to your answer, i did try running a hard wire straight to the modem and got the same result. my home network is not shared and is secure. and i still don't understand why my provider routes me from florida clear to minnesota at hop 4. i should mention their home office is like 15 miles from where i live...?
it way out of your control except to talk to the isp or switch isps as routing past that is, again, out of our control except to call in. i'm hearing this a lot now that netflix and other video streaming is saturating the pipes. bob
