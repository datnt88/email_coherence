it looks like some old stuff alright. i thought much use can be had unless someone really needs it. offhand, use the minimum bid of $1 as any s/h will cost as well. -or- sell as a lot for $10 or more, but be practical it is old stuff. tada -----willy
to get an idea of the value of a piece of hardware, search for it on ebay. use the option on the side of the page to view &quot;completed&quot; sales as most stuff like this will not find any buyers. if you live in a craig's list area, that's probably a good place to try to move some of your old &quot;goodies&quot; since there is no listing fee or seller's fee on craig's. the ebay listing fees on this &quot;yesterday's&quot; equipment list will bleed you dry. perhaps a better idea would be to find some place that takes &quot;tax write off&quot; where you might recover a bit of yesterday's values.
isa is dead and gone. motherboards that you can't prove working are in the 1 to 10 buck range. that jaton was famous for blue screens and more. take a hammer to it. bob
i tested the hardware already. how else would i know about the low cmos battery on one of the motherboards. i also loaded an os and played some audio cds on the sound cards. spent over a week testing everything and except for the battery it all works.
best bet is to ebay it and hope you get it gone. the items you noted are found in dumpsters around my town every week. bob
set your opening bid under a buck, 99 cents or a penny. no pics, buy it know or other enhancements will keep your listing fees down. figure accurate shipping to cover yourself. be realistic, it's only worth what you can sell it for. the second highest bidder will determine your selling price. i'd sell most of it as a &quot;lot&quot;. somebody will buy it, but cheap!
i just finished testing a first international computer inc. va-503+ motherboard so that is on the list too.
