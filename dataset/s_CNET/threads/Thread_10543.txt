1291	7	108417	1237394	1235719	funkid7	6/11/05 8:22 am	1.11847812e12	i may be wrong	i will count them when i install the drive. i will report back once i have decided on this install. i do very graphic intensive work and may need to make my new drive the master, which would change everything. mainly that is what i am trying to really find out: if i make my new drive the slave, then install adobe illustrator to it; will all files for illustrator install to the slave, even the sys files? this is important; that my cgi work and apps, stay on one drive, the new drive.
