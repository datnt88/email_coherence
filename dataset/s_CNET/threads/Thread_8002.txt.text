what are you looking to do graphics wise?
what do you think one do with graphic card, you don't got my ans. right
there are many things one may do with a graphic card, determining what kind of graphic card you need though depends on what things you're planning on doing with it. or do you want to spend $800 on a graphic card so that you can read your email?
