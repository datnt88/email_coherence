this was working fine. but now i can't see the files on my laptop from my desktop. when i try to display other pc's in my workgroup i get an error mshome is not accessible. you might not have permission to use this network resource. contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. the list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available. i recently installed kaspersky anti-virus after mcafee expired. but i've turned off the kaspersky firewall and am using windows firewall. there is says file sharing is allowed. but anyway i tried turning off all firewalls on both laptop and desktop and problem persists. i've been through network wizard several times on both machines and check file and printer sharing allowed. printer sharing still seems to work but not file sharing. looking for any suggestion before re-installing windows from scratch.
another member had a similar issue. with their &quot;suite&quot; the firewall was off but still working to block file sharing. they had to uninstall the suite to remove the block. this is a common bug in suites. bob
you were exactly right. i had to completely remove kaspersky (pos) from both desktop and laptop and file shareing started working again. fortunately, mcafee 2008 just became available, and i've installed it and file sharing still works. so i'm good for a year until that sub expires.
