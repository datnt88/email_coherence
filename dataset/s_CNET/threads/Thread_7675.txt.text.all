i'm having problems witht the diplay for my laptop. the icons go past the screens limit. 
when i check my display properties the &quot;default vga display&quot; comes up. 
when i go to the device mahager during safe mode there are exclamation marks on &quot;vga display controller&quot; the &quot;visual nd monitor&quot; i have tried to reinstall the display driver many times but that doesnt work. 
i have nvidia geforce4 420 go 32m on my gateway m500 notebook. 
windows xp home edition. 
i would appreciate any help. 
gateway cant seem to help any. 
have you tried cranking back the clock using system restore? 
have you recently installed microsoft service pack 2? when i installed sp2 it completely ruined my display and nvidia did not have a driver that was compatible. 
i uninstalled sp2 and everything is back to normal now.
