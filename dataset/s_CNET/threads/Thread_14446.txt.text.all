does a retail amd athlon 64 3000+ come with thermal paste or a thermal pad or should i buy some? 
i beleave yes it comes with either 
unless amd has downgraded their processors (whyyyyy would they do that? 
ha) then yeah it does, thats why the box is so big, it comes with a fan :p and i've heard of cases where it comes with either a thermal pad, or heat sink glue, so you'll get one or the other :p
