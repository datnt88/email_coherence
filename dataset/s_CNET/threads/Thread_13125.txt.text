try a new ide cable, then another drive. does that clear it up? bob
sorry..i forgot to mention...this is a labtop...
shut down and unplug the cdrw/dvd/cdrom (i don't know which or what you have) from the laptop and then plug it back in. most laptops i see have a swappable cdrw/dvd/cdrom unit. unplugging it can wipe the contacts and has fixed a few. next stop? warranty. bob
