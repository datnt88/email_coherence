<s> i've watched half of my new &quot;willy wonka and the chocolate factory&quot; on my home computer, which sports a pioneer bdc-202 blu-ray player.  </s>
<s> now, however, i can read and write other disks, but the 202 has stopped recognizing blu-ray disks altogether! the only updates i've made are microsoft's -- updates i've grown increasingly wary of -- and i'm wondering if it could be the updates that are creating this problem!  </s>
<s> not only will my powerdvd 8 not see it, neither can i get my system to see any content.  </s>
<s> indeed, it thinks there is no disk there.  </s>
<s> does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening?  </s>
<s> i can't believe it's a hardware problem, but who knows?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> john  </s>
<s> that tells me it's unlikely a software problem.  </s>
<s> but try reinstall the software anyway; it can't hurt.  </s>
<s> of course hardware do fail sometime but hopefully this is not the case.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> thanks, but there's no software i can retry.  </s>
<s> i go to the dvd drive icon and click on it, and it doesn't see any disk.  </s>
<s> yet if i put a standard dvd into it, it will read it just fine.  </s>
<s> a bd-rom drive can be had for about $50 now.  </s>
<s> as for why dvd works but not bd, my understand is that there 2 different scanning laser (1 for dvd and 1 for bd).  </s>
<s> strange, but i popped in my stargate blu-ray disc today and it plays fine.  </s>
<s> willy wonka used to play fine, too, but now my system can't see the disk.  </s>
<s> why would it see other blu-ray discs, but not a disc that had played once with ease?  </s>
<s> if i can't get a workable answer, i'll have to buy a fifty dollar lg disc player.  </s>
<s> go to the store and get another one.  </s>
