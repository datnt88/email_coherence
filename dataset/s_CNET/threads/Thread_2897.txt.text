i currently am doing audio recording using a compaq ap550 workstation, which has dual p3 processors (1ghz each), 1gb rdram, an nvidia quadro-4 980 8x agp (the mobo only runs 4x), all legacy disabled and my audio is via usb 2.0 (m-audio fasttrack pro). i also have a creative labs x-fi fidelity sound card. 18gb scsi u160 system disk and ata-100 250gb storage. lite-on cdrw/dvd rw combo. i'm running xp sp2. i want to upgrade the system and am currently reviewing motherboards. i'd like to keep as much existing hardware as possible, though i will replace the scsi with a sata drive. the quadro was a worker in its day but i suspect replacing it with as good a pci-ex for the reasonable $ i paid is going to be tough. i'm considering an asus p5vd1-x, 2gb ddr2 and a pentium d 2.66ghz. as it supports both agp-8x and pci-ex i could use my quadro until i'm ready to pop for a new gc. any thoughts on these boards? they are hard to find new and seem to have been replaced with the p5vd2-x pci-ex only. same board but no agp it seems. are there any others i might consider?
but you need to say goodbye to agp and most stuff in your compaq. keep the m-audio, x-fi, 250gb drive, and cd/dvd combo. your quadro is based on geforce 4 gpus. a geforce 7600 or radeon x1600 will run circles around it and they're only $120. also, don't get a pentium-d... its obsolete tech. a core2duo e4300 is the least you should consider. here's a suggested self-build for a $1000 pc. mobo, $112: gigabyte ga-965gm-s2 cpu, $185: core2duo e6300 2gb ram, $165: corsair vs2gbkit667d2 2x1gb ddr2-667 250gb hard drive, $80: seagate st3250824as sata mid-range video, $165: sapphire radeon x1950pro 256mb keyboard/mouse, $42: microsoft 69n-00013s wireless combo vista premium oem, $120 newegg total: $869 case/power supply $125: antec sonata ii w/450w power supply from circuit city/best buy/compusa grand total: $994
thanks good suggestions, especially the graphics comparisons. i already have vista business ready to go, except that m-audio and much of the recording hardware is still behind the curve, so it will have to be xp for a while longer. 64 bit even later. i have a new case / ps and wireless kb/mouse etc. core duo makes sense as i'm already sold on multi-processors anyway.
