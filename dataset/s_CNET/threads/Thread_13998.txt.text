my hardrive is going bad and i have xp home on it and don't like all the junk on the restore disk. my objective is to install a new hardrive with windows xp only and nothing else. i plan to install an xp pro upgrade after doing this. what is the best way to go about this? can i put the existing windows program files on a flash drive and boot the new hardrive with it? suggestions please!
if you are planning on going to xp pro when replacing the drive, you really do not need too much. when you buy the new drive, just put xp pro on it. if the program is really an upgrade, it just asks for the location of the previous version's install. i never really tried it with restore disks but you can try that. if that does not work, then install the old drive in for just the verification (maybe could be in an external enclosure) and then proceed. others may be able to give you more info on this for a workaround, or you could just use any qualifying os install disc.
xp home install cd. see here:  that is allot of work though, just for that but if it makes you feel more legal, then go for it.
if yes...you do not need to reinstall xp home before upgrading to xp pro. all you need do is start the xp pro upgrade and when it asks about the os to be upgraded ...you put in the xp home cd. once the xp home is verified, put the xp pro cd in and finish the install. if it doesn't work ...lemme know. vapcmd
