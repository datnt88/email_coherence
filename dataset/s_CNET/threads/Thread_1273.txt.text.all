i store my mp3 music in the windows media library. 
when a copy a selected mp3 piece of music and copy it to my external hard drive i think it looses its properties. the mp3 icon is missing and if i bring it back to my library it wont play. 
please advise. 
try saving it to another location, my documents or my music and see what result you get, should be able to do that without issue. 
some properties are lost if the external hard drive is in fat32 format. 
fix? 
convert it to ntfs and try again.
