hp deskjet 3420 model printer, very new and the printer head won't move when sent a print job. can hear a spinning sound like it's trying to move. was working fine. have checked all settings and all appear to be correct. any suggestions? i'm not a techie so simple answers would help greatly. thanks!
do a printer &quot;self-test&quot;, review your manual or help guide on how that's done with your model printer. if it can't print a self-test page, then likely the printer is hosed. check to see that the ink carts are firmly seated and/or if any blinking leds are present on the printer. until, you do a self-test don't mess with windows at all, you may cause further problems. also, the support website at hp should explain common problems and resolutions. you can aslo try the printer's &quot;toolbox&quot; if applicable for your model, it should provide some insight and maybe a self-test as well. good luck -----willy
i'd lift the cover up, or open the back (think that's where hps have a door) to look for a paper jam. as willy pointed out, look for a blinking light. can mean many things, including a paper jam.
