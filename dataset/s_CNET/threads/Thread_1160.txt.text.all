<s> i built our computer about five years ago so we are well past the time when it needs to be replaced.  </s>
<s> i've been upgrading ram and storage as we go, but we've reached the end of the road with this one.  </s>
<s> i'm considering two different computers for purchase: one is a refurbished from buy.com, and one is a newer tower from best buy.  </s>
<s> regardless of which one i get i plan on installing a second hard drive (to separate the operating system from the data) which i'm guessing would void any warranty that comes with the machine.  </s>
<s> so bear that in mind.  </s>
<s> (related thread: ) i don't do any gaming or video editing so we are looking at photos, music, streaming video, etc. gateway dx4822-01 (refurb) $399  </s>
<s> there are too many reasons even more so when we talk about video work.  </s>
<s> ok, the warranty is split into a few areas.  </s>
<s> yes you'll not get any warranty support for the os. it was not that good anyway as most questions end with &quot;restore the factory os.&quot; but the hardware is still under warranty with something you must know going in.  </s>
<s> they won't support you with a hardware issue unless you restore the factory load.  </s>
<s> some get upset about that but 'dems the rules'.  </s>
<s> while the x4500 might be slammed by some, outside of games i find it a great solution.  </s>
<s> my laptop with a 4500mhd connects to the hdtv with hdmi and plays hd content just fine.  </s>
<s> and with your i3 you'll scream past my laptop's older c2d 2.0ghz cpu.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you mean return it to the state it was in when i purchased it?  </s>
<s> isn't it still void as i cracked the case can could have done anything when in there without them knowing?  </s>
<s> i rarely see any company rule so harshly.  </s>
<s> given the nature of desktops and the need to clean them yearly how would we avoid opening the case.  </s>
<s> of course they would cover a non-stock setup.  </s>
<s> but if you do this right you can return it to stock when needed.  </s>
<s> hard disks are so cheap that i could remove the supplied drive, slip in a new drive just for my use.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> they used to have those seals over the case side.  </s>
<s> so ridiculous.  </s>
<s> so it's really worth the extra $160?  </s>
<s> i meant no one covers the non-stock machine.  </s>
<s> the old pentium core unit is strictly a value item and nothing more.  </s>
<s> how much do you value your time?  </s>
<s> i guess i'm just shocked that there's $160 worth of value in the processor considering i'm going to void the warranty the minute i get home.  </s>
<s> i wasn't expecting that.  </s>
<s> does anyone else agree?  </s>
<s> looking at benchmarks your one hour video render on the i3 should take longer than 1.5 hours (my bet is 2+ hours) on the dated dual core.  </s>
<s> yes, it's worth it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ... but i don't render video.  </s>
<s> i might rip some dvd's so i have backups for my kids, but rendering video is not something i know how to do or am looking to learn.  </s>
<s> all and i mean all dvd rippers i've seen render some of the dvd to get an idea of what to do with the dvd.  </s>
<s> if you want to make a less than great upgrade to a value only box then do that.  </s>
<s> at least someone warned you.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i wasn't making the connection there.  </s>
