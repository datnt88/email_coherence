<s> hey, i'm looking for a burner that won't stop working on me.  </s>
<s> i've purchased 2 burners that broke down in only a couple of uses.  </s>
<s> i don't care about the speed and stuff, i just need recommendations of cd-rw drives.  </s>
<s> one that can burn hundreds of cds and not stop burning.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> that is very very odd! the last time we encountered such a thing... 1. the case was far too hot. it was cooking the drives.  </s>
<s> 2. the power supply was fair too out of spec.  </s>
<s> i've used from 9 dollar to 30 dollar cdrw drives for years now and they do very well.  </s>
<s> at this price i'm very happy as they go past 2 years old.  </s>
<s> my thought here is that something else is wrong.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> how do i check if something else is wrong?  </s>
<s> my first burner was on my old computer - that one was fairly cheap.  </s>
<s> the other one automatically came on my alienware computer, so i don't know how much that one cost.  </s>
<s> i've seen searching on the internet on drives for the burner but that hasn't worked.  </s>
<s> thanks for replying so quick !  </s>
<s> windows doesn't need such.  </s>
<s> however you may need software to record onto cdr or cdrw with.  </s>
<s> i use a bit.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i use ahead nero.  </s>
<s> also my cd-rw is a lite-on ltr-48246s  </s>
<s> also, now that you note that drive model, something does not jive with your claims such died in a few months.  </s>
<s> these models were available in the early 2003 timeframe.  </s>
<s> this is late 2004 so you may have had this unit for almost 18 months.  </s>
<s> given the prices we pay for cdrw drives you may have to pay out 20 to 40 bucks or less every 1 to 2 years.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i kind of wondered, based on your hundreds of cds comment, whether you using the deck for a commercial purpose?  </s>
<s> anyway, the 8x dvd-rw dual format burner i bought is down to $49.00 us.  </s>
<s> that has a 40x cd burn speed.  </s>
<s> something you might keep in mind.  </s>
<s> chuck  </s>
