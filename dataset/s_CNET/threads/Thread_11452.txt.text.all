<s> i can't recall any creative mtrbds.  </s>
<s> out there that they made.  </s>
<s> yes, they do provide the audio portion but make the whole mtrbd.  </s>
<s> nope.  </s>
<s> i suggest you visit this website and follow thier lead: get the info you need and proceed.  </s>
<s> now, if creative really did &quot;rebadge&quot; a mtrbd.  </s>
<s> and put thier name on it, they should provide the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> info.  </s>
<s> but, that becomes lost on older or not so popular mtrbds.  </s>
<s> and it gets hard to find.  </s>
<s> you may find a more &quot;generic&quot; support for the *chipset* on the mtrbd., these are the main componets and if you find them, make sure they'll do what you want and various flavours are out there.  </s>
<s> last, as for the 40gb hd, you'll never see the true 40gb become available due to the os used and how the manufacturer supplies info, get more detailed answers from the hd maker.  </s>
<s> they usually offer an explanation on this common question/query.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> waz up sir mortis, i'm not sure what components are provide by creative, but i don't think they make mother boards either.  </s>
<s> so i think the best way to go at this is the simplest, just open your case and see who's the manufacturer of the motherboard.  </s>
<s> then go to their website to get latest bio.  </s>
<s> if you find no name most manufacturer stick to a specific circuit color on their mother board.  </s>
<s> like brown for &quot;asus&quot; and ... but not all mother board do support 1 gig of mem.  </s>
<s> -sherwin  </s>
<s> 1. diamond was absorbed by creative labs and did indeed make such a board.  </s>
<s> look for the m7p9 or such designation on the motherboard to find out which is yours.  </s>
<s> without this, i can't help much.  </s>
<s> has a few manuals, but which one is yours?  </s>
<s> 2. about the ram.  </s>
<s> no bios can fix this issue!  </s>
<s> i will explain it once and only once since nothing we can do with bios or jumpers or words will fix a simple problem. the bx memory controller only has so many address lines running to the memory sockets.  </s>
<s> to get 256m support it runs two cas lines to the sockets. the generic 256m stick will identify as 128m and this is proper.  </s>
<s> if you get the dual bank 256m sticks, then it works.  </s>
<s> but you are unlikely to get such at the grocery store or most computer shops.  </s>
<s> crucial does have the right parts.  </s>
<s> again, there is nothing in a bios revision or anything you can do to fix this except get the right memory parts.  </s>
<s> with that, i will write no more about it.  </s>
<s> write back with which board you have if you want me to see if a bios to go past 32gb on the hard disk exists.  </s>
