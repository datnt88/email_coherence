i was ignorant and bought a couple of the infamous rock mobile disk off the guy on ebay. could someone help me with steps to recovery of data? my seems to run fine, computer says there are no errors, but i don't see the drive as being recognized on my computer. what should i do first? can i start with &quot;testdisk&quot;, and i can i download that from the internet? actual drive inside the case is a magnetic data technologies drive, 500gb thanks mark
the usual titles are noted in the top post of this forum. the answer is that the tools are downloadable from the internet. bob
the one title which seemed to apply involved editing the registry, but i have tried this external drive on three different computers with the same result. this rules out any issues with the pc itself.
sorry but the top sticky post does not note any registry editing. try the lost and found post again. i don't duplicate it's content in replies. bob
in the sticky, post 4 of 6, if you go the microsoft support link, then clicking on the &quot;let me fix it myself&quot; section, then to detailed instruction, it is i saw the registry editing. i don't work in it, i'm a mech engineer, so i'm out of my area of expertise.
have free and free to try software titles. the reason for multiple choices is that no two failures are alike. if none of the self help items are possible then the companies we know do this work are listed in the forum sticky. remember that backup copies are very cheap compared to recovery. bob
