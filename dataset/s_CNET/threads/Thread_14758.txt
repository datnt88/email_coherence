7996	15	89480	1017300	1016272	john46947	3/4/05 9:14 pm	1.10997084e12	power up	you know these guys are all probably on the right track with the power supply theory. though in my experience power supply undervolt reboots happen early and regularly. i've never seen them happen randomly. that is because every device in your system pulls a certain wattage consistantly and if you are overloading the supply you'll know soon after boot up. unless of course you have a cheap no name supply that doesn't have a steady power output to start with. most decent power supplies have a 20% +/- tolerance rating and will push well beyond their limitations before failing. however there are a handful of asian manufacturers that build cheap crap that can't take much of a load at all. the way to find out is to locate the supplies fcc-id number and visit the fcc website to lookup the manufacturer. if you have a cheapo you probably won't find an fcc-id anywhere on the unit. once you know who makes the supply simply do a google search on the supplies make and model number and include the word &quot;review&quot;. you'll soon find out more than you ever wanted to know about your power supply.
7996	16	89480	1017446	1017300	john46947	3/4/05 11:11 pm	1.10997786e12	here's an outside possibility though not very likely.	i've run across 5 or 6 boards in the last couple of years that had flaky hard to diagnose shut-down problems. after ruling out memory with a stand-alone memory tester and finding no obvious software issues i turned to visually inspecting the mainboards. on each of these mainboards i found blown capacitors. they can sometimes be hard to spot but they will usually be bloated and/or have a brown oose or crust on the top or bottom. the brown stuff is electrolytic fluid used within the capacitor. this issue has been more prominent lately because the war for low prices has made a few mainboard manufaturers start buying cheaper componets. another cause of capacitor failure is over volting or power surges. a power surge caused by a lightning strike or power grid burp can do damage to a mainboard instantly or over time. having your computer on a surge protector isn't a garuntee against surges since most lightning strikes will come from phone or network lines rather than power lines. the reason for this is because power lines are grounded at each poll while the phone system is not. if a capacitor receives a jolt beyond it's limitations it may continue to work even though it's damaged. over time it can and most likely will fail. the only way to know for sure is to either visually see that it's blown or test it with a multimeter.

(read the *&^%ing directions). of course, the manual (directions) don't ever state anything about recommended psu. but, i picked up the box the other day and noticed that ''recommended power supply is 300 watts.'' however, i think what was causing my issues was not the power supply, but; 1. a bad memory stick (i've swapped out and isolated - i hope - the one bad stick) 2. i think the fan on the graphics card is going bad. it now makes a grinding noise when i boot up. when i touch the card, the noise subsides for a bit. the noise lasts for about 20-25 seconds. graham
