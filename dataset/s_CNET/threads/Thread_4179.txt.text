i am runnning winxp. i am trying to format my slave drive. i have a win 98 bootdisk floppy . i disconnected my primay drive because i did not want to make any mistakes. when i run fdisk i get these questions asking if i want to enable large disk support. i chose yes. but after that it just goes to a black screen with the line just blinking. is something wrong with the disk or should i just be more patient.
it's not that bright about the missing boot drive. bob
ok. how do i fix this.
option 5 lets you change the drive and do as you want. i won't teach how to use fdisk since we have web content and it's been around for a few decades. but it is a rather old program and doesn't work with misconfigured machines. even if you did that on purpose. bob
using xp disk management. start, settings, control panel, administrative tools, computer management, disk management, your system is probably hanging 'cause it's jumpered as sl and there's no ma. vapcmd
