(usually its when 4 slots are filled, but since you only have 3 slots...) as for your mobo being designed for memory that doesn't exist... that's not unusual either. the ddr-400 spec was really late -- it was finalized after ddr-400 sticks were already on the market. also mobo manufacturers often try to anticipate future tech but the tech world changes so fast some of those predictions don't pan out.
