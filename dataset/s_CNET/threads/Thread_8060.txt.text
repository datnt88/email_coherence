how fast is the memory? there is a possibility your mobo doesn't recognize the memory because it isn't at a compatible speed.
the speed is at ddr3200 which is the exact speed the processor and mobo takes
try switching the sticks' positions. if that doesn't work, try installing them one at a time.
the white clips should be vertical and you shouldn't be able to pull the stick out without opening the clips. for dual channel mode, put the sticks in the two blue slots. the beeping noise is actually a beep sequence. your mobo manual will tell what the beep sequence you're hearing means.
