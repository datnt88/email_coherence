i just talked to dell support, who i got my laptop through, and they said the biggest fastest drive i could upgrade to is 100gb and 7200 rpm. although i'll probably follow these requirements, i was just wondering why the size of hard drives in laptops is limited. anyone know? what if i put in a 320gb hard drive? would it work? oh yeah, if i did upgrade my hard drive, is there some kind of program already installed (i have xp media center edition) that can make a complete transfer of all my data to the new drive or would i have to download a special program?
there are 3 limits here; - the hard disk itself (it must be a 2&quot; inch one) - the bios (depends on the model of dell) - the os without knowing details on the machine, we don't know the limits of the bios. dell does, but maybe you can tell us? to clone the drive, you'll need some place that has access to both drives. and that won't be your laptop if that has only one drive. the best thing to do: use the cloning software that comes with your new drive and mount it in an external enclosure to do the cloning. hope this helps. kees
if they support the 100gb you can go to 127gb without issue. you didn't share model, the os on the restore cds so this is my answer. bob
ok it's an inspiron 6400 e1505. do you know why the operating system and motherboard limit the size? i just built a desktop pc, and it had no such restrictions. what's so different between the two, besides their bulk?
let's say your restore cds are &quot;xp home.&quot; since those don't have sp1 then the limit is there. widely documented so i'll stop here.
so even a desktop with xp home without sp1 couldn't accept use a bigger hard drive? sorry, i'm a noob. my laptop is a xp media center edition with sp2.
-&gt; read  sorry i should have put that in my reply before.
that makes sense. thanks!
it's actually xp pro sp2. my mistake, i forgot i changed its appearance to that of the media center edition.
