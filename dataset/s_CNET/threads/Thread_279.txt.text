i have a few network cables that transmit at a very slow rate. if i replace the cables with other ones the network goes fast. could it be... the slow cables are not in the 568-b nor in the 568-a order. they are crimped the same on both ends though. example. orange white/orange green white/green brown white/brown blue white/blue the reason i came to this conclusion is the &quot;pairs&quot; are twisted, and if if the network has to transmit along the wrong pair could the be interferance of something? can anyone explain.
that's not proper. here's a link about what's wrong.  hint, pins 3,4,5,6 are wrong. bob
it doesn't matter if the cables conform to any wiring standard as long as they are the same on both ends. this would still be a straight through cable. examine the printing on the cable to determine the rated bandwidth/speed. cat.3, cat.5, cat.5e, cat.6?
the signal would not be on pairs so you get the effect above. please do a little more research. bob
you're right bob. i leapt before i looked. his wiring scheme on 1,2,3,6 would be org, wht/org, grn, wht/blue. consider me busted too! but thanks for the heads up.
such cable errors is one reason our tech was able to buy his new hybrid. the first reason is spyware. thank you all spyware authors? bob
