trying to change the color quality in the setting area of display in the control panel area. 
every time i try to change form 16bit color to 256 it does not take. 
has anyone had this problem before. 
currently runing win 98. 
why do you want to lower the color settings? 
16 bit will display several million colors whereas the 256 setting will display only 256 colors and that is all. 
unless you are trying to reduce the picture quality i'd leave that alone. 
in fact if your video card has the option i'd set it to 32 bit. 
thanks. it was my daughter pc. i guess it has to do with some games she is running for the grandkid
