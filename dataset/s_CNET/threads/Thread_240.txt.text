i have been trying to find out some things about these 2 mouse's. so far the things i have heard about the 2 are this. logitech g600 is bigger and really is best for people with big hands but its reliable. naga are small and are reliable. i have touched a naga while at bestbuy but could not get my hands on the logitech. and most of the people i have ask have said either one thing or another about both. i want a mouse that wont break on me in just a few months because it is bad. i'm not a hard core gamer and i don't mash my buttons hard like some do. so what is the best mouse in your guys opinion?
my logitech m510 is about a year old and no sign of fatigue. it wasn't expensive either. i'd get it again. bob
i am a logitech fan and have been for years, that is all i will use, bar none.
