i am looking for a new graphics card what is the best one to get? i am looking to spend around $100. question, if you get one with a s-video cable can you hook it up to your tv? can you also record what is being showing on the tv?

here are good choices for your budget, ranked by performance. they all should work fine with a decent 300-350watt power supply. pci-express: radeon x1650pro 256mb, $88 ($10 rebate) radeon x1650 256mb, $76 geforce 7600gs 256mb, $91 ($20 rebatee) geforce 7300gt 256mb, $70 ($10 rebate) agp: radeon x1650 256mb, $90 geforce 7600gs 256mb, $106
i am not sure which slots i have. i have a hp a6030n

hi there! i currently have an ati radeon x1600 pro 256. i sometimes experience some lag when i'm playing games and i was wondering if upgrading to the radeon x1650 pro 512 would show a considerable difference? (i'm currently running 1gb of ram, would upgrading to 2gb also solve the slowdowns?)
it will slowdown. there is no known system that doesn't slowdown on complex scenes. if you are running vista, the 2gb is well known as a must have on games. bob
x1650pro is just a bit faster than x1600pro but not worthwhile as an upgrade. in my opinion, you'd need to upgrade to a x1950pro or 7900gs for a noticeable improvement and only a x1950xt or 7950gt (or better) would be worth the cash. if you're slowing down in certain games, more ram may help depending on the game. for example, battlefield 2 needs 1.5gb or more for smooth play.
