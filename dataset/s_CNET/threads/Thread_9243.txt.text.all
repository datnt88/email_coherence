<s> hey everyone, i am having a problem with my network, i have a netgear router with a netgear pc adapter. the connection is *very good*, but when i try to download the speeds vary from 8kb/s-&gt;20kb/s.  </s>
<s> i have tried everything from calling netgear to cleaning out my computer, nothing has worked.  </s>
<s> if anyone might have any suggestions it would be very helpful.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> for instance it's half duplex and shares the air space of other devices.  </s>
<s> add this that the wifi signal can travel out and reflect back to distort the transmission means that only under ideal conditions it's all good.  </s>
<s> you didn't tell much in your post such as if you are following our suggestions in the forum sticky so i hope you can use that or tell us the full details.  </s>

<s> look for a quality of service setting in the router's program, it's possible the wireless has been throttled down there.  </s>
<s> i had the exact opposite problem in which my two oldest using wireless would almost steal the entire bandwith, even though i was hardwired to the modem.  </s>
<s> to slow them down and give me back bandwidth i disabled the wmm support and gave me high priority and them both low priority settings.  </s>
<s> bandwidth control can also be enabled in such section.  </s>
<s> since you seem interested in faster wifi, just do the opposite.  </s>
<s> i have always used wireless.  </s>
<s> just 2 weeks ago i was downloading at a constant 120 kb/s.  </s>
<s> 10 days ago i installed a video card but i left the network card untouched, but after that the card has been acting weird.  </s>
<s> i download at speed from 8-12kb/s which is very depressing.  </s>
<s> help would be appreciated.thanks!  </s>
<s> you didn't tell in either post so far.  </s>
<s> it's post number 2 at bob  </s>
