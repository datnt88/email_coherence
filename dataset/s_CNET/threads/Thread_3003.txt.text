guys, i want to try to build my own desktop. i am sick of ungrading my old computer. i am ready for the challenge of building my own, and save some money in the process. i want to be able to play world of warcraft, do wordprocessing, and internet. any suggestions on what i should do. want to spend no more than $750. thanks
it seems like it is a popular website used by many. they got reviews and everything there. here, this $500 machine they built will run you world of warcraft and word processing.  you can spend the left over money on monitor, ram, or whatever you want
do you need a complete system (complete computer box, keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor)? or do you already have a good monitor or speakers that you wish to add to a computer box that you will build? btw, congratulations on taking on this challenge. i find it is quite rewarding to build a new machine. i trust you will, also.
i'm also in the planning stages of building a new computer. i have chosen all of my hardware which includes an amd x2 processor, asus motherboard, western digital sata hard drive, sony dvd-rw etc.. my main concert at the moment is making sure i buy all of the cables i require. the harddrives and optical drives that i have priced up are oem so i wont recieve the cables like i would in a retail box. also not sure about the motherboard having cables packaged with it. does anyone have or know the where about of a checklist of some description that i can use to make sure i have everything i need before i start. i'd hate to of started to find i was missing simple things.
a retail motherboard should come with all the cables you need for hard drives, optical drives, floppy drive, etc. in fact they often come with more than you need. look carefully at the description of the motherboard. it should say which cables are included.
