i have a lexmark x1270 that is less than a year old. i usually use ms word but i have several legal documents that are in wordpefect 11 and it won't print anything. it prints word, wordpad, notepad, excell, images etc. just not wordperfect. i emailed lexmark support about this but have not as yet received a reply. i was able to print wordperfect from this computer when i had an hp printer, which i no longer have. any ideas.
from memory you had to do something in wp to enable a new printer. let's see if google can help? this is from corel about this version. from there we go to
sorry but at this time their web site stopped working for me but it did tell me enough that we need the printer driver for your wp 11 as well as the one for windows. there is one (free) exit here and that is to copy the document to open office and print it from there. try wp's save as a .rtf and see how open office handles it. bob
first i tried using open office only to find that my copy has a missing dll and therefore doesn't work. they suggest downloading a new copy which one of these days i will probably do. i then went to lexmark and downloaded drivers and almost before i could blink the printer began printing out a 17 page document ( i forgot to change the default from print document to print current page.) but it works now. thanks again.
