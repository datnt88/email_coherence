i am blessed with a large number of cheap software offers including the disk of the software. has anyone tried these offers and do you receive the software or is it a scam? i need to obtain windows xp for a new machine i am building. do you receive a licens with these offers to make them legal? thanks for any feedback.
simple a scam to part you with your money. bob
&quot;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is&quot;. emails, emails, what a load we all get. i wouldn't trust any as far as i can toss a server. beware laddy, its all a trap, stay clear. there are far, far too many pitfalls than good harbors of safety. check out  and other websites that have a good history of selling &quot;reputable goods&quot; at respecyable but lower pricing. google for vendors that may offer decent pricing but beware regardless of any real cheap offering. also, under that xp is sold as retail package, oem, or eductional offerings. good luck -----willy
 - oem windowsxp is like $80  - some have issues with them, but their decent (a little more expensive and slightly less selection of hardware) and  is supposed to be pretty good i've only bought from newegg and tiger  is trustable also, but i've never purchased from them before
