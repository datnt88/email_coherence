<s> hi, im looking to turn my old desktop pc into a dvr to record some tv shows and watch them through my tv i hate to miss. the problem is that im a poor collage student so i dont have the mega-bucks to spend on the project.  </s>
<s> im torn between the hauppauge wintv-150 and the ati tv wonder elite.  </s>
<s> i know that the ati card has a better picture than the 150 but i dont think my pc can handle it. the newest os i have to run on this machine is windows 2000 pro.  </s>
<s> my machine has a 1 ghz piii processor and as much ram as i can put in it.  </s>
<s> bottom line i just dont wont to waste money on something with poor resolution.  </s>
<s> i also welcome alternatives  </s>
<s> so your cpu isn't an issue. the ati may have better video processing (slightly sharper image especially in still frames), but both will have the same resolution.  </s>
<s> i think you'll be satisfied with the wintv.  </s>
<s> ...particularly on the pvr software.  </s>
<s> i believe 1.6ghz is the normal cutoff point for mpeg-2 recording, so your box will probably only be capable of encoding in mpeg-1, which leaves a little to be desired in terms of resolution quality.  </s>
