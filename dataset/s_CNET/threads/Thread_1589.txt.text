hope some one can help me i am looking in to buying a new computer and wanted to know some stuff about the grafix cards. what is pixel pipelines is it better if the number is high or low? like pixel pipelines 16 or 24? what is fill rate is it better if its low or high? like fill rate 15.6 gigapixel/s or 10.4 gigapixel/s? memory bandwidth same queston is it better high or low number? like memory bandwidth 46.4 gb/s or memory bandwidth 51.2 gb/s and lastly sorry if this is long but what about memory speed? better higher or lower. like memory speed 1600 mhz or memory speed 1450 mhz . thank you very much for your time.
i think the higher numbers are better then the lower one.
a higher figure is better in all your categories, but don't rely on those raw fill rate/memory bandwidth figures when comparing cards with different gpus. pick a budget, find some cards that fit in your budget, then start reading some reviews on those cards. use benchmark charts like this:  and this:  to compare performance. also, don't be fooled into thinking that a card is automatically better because it has 512mb of ram. a x1300 w/512mb is still slower than a x1600 w/256mb.
i got this information from tigerdirect.com it may help you: i used a lot off glosarrys to help me learn the terms so when i ask for help, they knew what i was talking about. this might be a lot to read but it is a lot on the basics. i wish it was a link but here it is. good luck wendell h video glosarry compiled by tigerdirect editors numbers 16-bit -
