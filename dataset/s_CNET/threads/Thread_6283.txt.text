all my program files converted to lnk files from exe files and now i can't run anything. how do i change them back???????
what does such a shortcut link to (have a look in its properties)? what happens if you doubleclick it? i'm rather sure that windows won't run if all program files were converted to .lnk files. explorer.exe for example is a rather essential program to run and it seems you still have your desktop, so explorer.exe must be running. so maybe it's just a subset that you changed by accident? so tell more.
there are other pests that do this. once you identify the worm, virus, trojan or &quot;pest&quot; then we look for the cure. bob
doodledog, which version of windows are you running? note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. are you using lavasoft's ad-watch? tufenuf
sorry for not including my specs....my os is xp home and i am running ad-aware plus and zone labs suite, my system is a dell from 2001. all of a sudden my desktop icons went from their usual designs to a file-looking format. and i can't run most programs. my regseeker icon and my recycle bin icon are normal looking, but i still can't run them. i have to go to my start menu to run my isp. i've gotten into my regedit folder and tried to get permission to edit, but am denied. going into my file type tab and trying to enter an exe application won't cure my problem either.
doodledog, take your time and go thru the entire thread at the link below.  tufenuf
