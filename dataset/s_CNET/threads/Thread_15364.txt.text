hi there one of my internal modems have broken and a friend has given me a adsl external modem. can i use this modem for dialup or do i need broadband to use this modem on. thanks to all who answer this query. kindest regards tony b.
nope, that's broadband alright. you need a &quot;dail-up&quot; modem and internal types cost in the under $20 range, maybe even $10 for a real cheap one. a freebie if brought at officemax as a rebate $0 deal. good luck -----willy
 for cheap modems. a clue was to see nowhere to plug phone line into as the cat 5 plug is too wide.
