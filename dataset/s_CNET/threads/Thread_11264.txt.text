could anybody tell me if there's a tablet that can show live tv as i can get on my home pc?
you'll have to be more specific. for example ustream works on my tablet and it's a live feed so unless you mean something else?
no,what you've stated is exactly what i'm after. what tablet do you have?
just to try it the last tablet was the g tablet  i also have a bn color nook with the cyranogen installed. but maybe there's more to this than ustream. it's just an app. link follows.  you can find better tablets than this thing i happen to have today. our office works on apps so i never know exactly which tablets are free at the time. bob
software then hardware. directv has an app that you can watch live shows if you have dtv account. hbo has an application. espn & the big ten network also have apps to view sporting events.
