i have 3 computers and am trying to hook them up to a network. i have the linksys wrt54g and the appropriate adapters for the other 2 computers. i installed the router and was able to connect to the internet fine. it told me to install the other 2 adapters before setting up the network. i installed the 1st adapter fine and came to check my router connection and i could connect to the internet. i tried everything to connect and finally had to restore to yesterdays settings just to be able to use my cable modem again. what am i doing wrong? and is there someone who can talk me through it? thanks for any help. windows xp
since you didn't tell us anything about your system, that's all i can say.
it can make a difference how your network is booted up. the manufacturers manual will probably tell you in which order to boot the system after installing all your hardware. stefan
i am running windows xp on a dell dimension 2400. i am running virus and firewall protection with mcafee. thanks steve
make sure you have your firewall set to allow connections in the trusted zone. this is your home network. the ip address range is usually, depending on your router, 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.199. you'll need to set up each machine within that range. good luck, click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. if you're reading this, thank a teacher. if you're reading this in english, thank a u.s. soldier.
