i have this virus that creates &quot;new folder&quot; everytime i refresh or i got to specific drive. even though i delete it, it comes back again. i tried to install avg 7.5 but it seems to not help at all. any comments will do, thanks!
there are folders that windows creates too. too bad the name of the folder was omitted. bob
this one is different. my usb got infected as well but when we scanned it (dont remember what anti-virus), it detected a worm on it. i tried to scanned my pc with avg 7.5 but it only detects spyware. the new folder thing is still there.
that the name of the folder or the worm is not shared. as it stands i can only suggest online scans. bob
