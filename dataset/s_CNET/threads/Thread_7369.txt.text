awhile ago i was watching a video on cnet.tv. veronica belmont was instructing us how to use two computers with one ipod, and not lose all your files. can anyone provide me with the link to that? or something similar?
so here's the url, i don't know if this was exactly what you were looking for, but i think it's close
but if you turn off the automatic update, in itunes preferences, on each machine. you will then be able to attach the ipod to either machine without loosing any music tracks. to put music onto the ipod, you would drag and drop from itunes to the mounted ipod. hope this helps p post 3 of 3 | previous
