<s> ok, i have decided to wait until the p38 motherboards come out before i customize a new computer.  </s>
<s> here is what i am thinking of getting for current use to be capable of upgrading.  </s>
<s> quad 6600 p38 motherboard single 8800 gts 640 mb graphics card not sure what case to get i think a 650w powersupply would suffice no sound card i would like a media card reader and of course dvd-r/dvd most likely a 500 gb hard drive, i have read raptors are really only a few secs faster, so no need to spend extra for just a few secs if i am going to get only 1 graphics card, i see no reason to get a sli or crossfire mobo, correct?  </s>
<s> with the above generic hardward, what specific brands would you recommend?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> x38 based mobos should be out around sept 23rd.  </s>
<s> it brings pci-express 2.0 and some memory latency improvements.  </s>
<s> initially most x38s will be ddr3 only but some manufacturers are planning ddr2 versions.  </s>
<s> almost all will have at least 2 pci-e x16 slots.  </s>
<s> performance-wise, the x38 should be a bit (3-5%) faster than a stock p35, but a well tuned p35 will close the gap.  </s>
<s> since you're choosing mid-high range components a p35 mobo should be sufficient.  </s>
<s> why spend $240 on a mobo and then put a $280 cpu in it? the x38 is intended for ultra-high end performance and components.  </s>
<s> i had thought of the p38 for sake of energy efficiency and power consumption from what i had heard about that mobo.  </s>
<s> you are right, that i could go with the p35 as i am not intending to overclock at all.  </s>
<s> from the components i am looking at, what kind of case would you recommend?  </s>
<s> would a corsair 650w psu be overkill or something i should consider?  </s>
<s> since you've said you're not interesting in sli/crossfire, a 500w unit should suffice.  </s>
<s> the corsair 620w is $170 while the 520w is $125 (from newegg).  </s>
<s> either of these 500w power supplies are good alternatives also.  </s>
<s> antec neohe 500, $80: coolermaster real power pro rs-550, $99: as for a case, that's mostly a matter of choice.  </s>
<s> side window?  </s>
<s> drive door?  </s>
<s> flashy lights?  </s>
<s> i'm a big fan of the coolermaster cavalier and mystique cases.  </s>
<s> cavalier, $75 (also avail in silver): mystique, $75:  </s>
