1110	2	536342	5178977	5178925	cvwheeler	8/2/11 8:24 am	1.31227344e12	thanks	i have ruled out any software related issues because it boots in less than 60 seconds if i power down and reboot. if it were software related it would boot slowly everytime i power down and reboot. btw, i keep my registry cleaned up on a regular basis and defrag my drive once a week. once i get past that first slow boot up in the morning, it is lightining fast for the rest of the day. i think the disk drive is the cause of the problem. i think the drive is slow to come up to speed. once it is warmed up it works fine.
