<s> i have one of these pc's and have been happy with it.  </s>
<s> had it about 4 years.  </s>
<s> now want to sell it and get a laptop.  </s>
<s> where do i start?  </s>
<s> how can i get my desktop in a saleable condition, i.e. get everything off it?  </s>
<s> any help greatly appreciated!  </s>
<s> you can look up dban but first be sure you have the restore media and that it works.  </s>
<s> after you dban it, restore it and it's ready.  </s>
<s> sadly i see these go for 99 bucks all the time on ebay.  </s>
<s> you may want to consider just offering it without all the work on the hard drive (just dban it) and then put it out to freecycle.  </s>

<s> thank you r proffitt.  </s>

<s> i will look up dban and find out what that's all about.  </s>
