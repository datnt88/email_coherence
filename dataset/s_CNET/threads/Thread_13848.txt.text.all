<s> when i am on the net on some sites i only get the view in the middle third of the screen.  </s>
<s> on other sites i get a full screen.  </s>
<s> when i am offline line playing free cell i get a top down stretch of the game.  </s>
<s> can any one help?  </s>
<s> if the site is designed for say an 800 x 600 resolution and you have say a 1440 x 900 resolution(widescreen) then you may have some margin space on some sites that hard code how wide the page is, like cnet here but also others.  </s>
<s> some windows can be resized and very few sites i'd imagine allow you to tell the computer what size your window is to allow all of it to be used.  </s>
<s> so in short, unless you like low resolutions and enjoy those pains, there isn't a solution for you.  </s>
<s> regards, jb  </s>
<s> i thought there was no solution but i asked anyway  </s>
