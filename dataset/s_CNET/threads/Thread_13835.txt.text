i have an ide hdd with an sata dvd/rw and it takes about 5 mins to boot. once it finally boots everything runs as smooth as a baby's bottom. but it just takes forever to boot up. but when i unplug the sata dvd rom and plug in a regular ide cd rom drive to the same cable as the hdd and set its jumper to slave it boots in seconds. is there maybe some setting i'm missing in my bios?  geforce 6100pm-m2 v2.0 megatrends bios v02.67 thanks for any advice beau
i've seen that for years. and since the makers don't seem interested in issuing a bios or fix i use the drive that works best. bob
well that's a bummer, i have all kinds of dvd burners that are sata and all kinds of hard drives that are ide. i guess i'm going to have to invest in some ide burners and/or some sata hard drives. thanks bob, beau
the downside is it doesn't give me 2 devices per ide channel but it did allow me to use some cheaply acquired dvdrw drives. bob
