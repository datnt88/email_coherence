if a firewall is installed, that's a common complaint. and to pre-emptively note such, even when disabled, zone alarm still interferes with this. bob
i've run into similiar problems, particularly with my pro system (have 1 98, 1 xp home laptop, and my main system with pro). bob mentioned zonealarm, which i use. in the firewall configuration, i added the ip addresses of all the computers, and the full range of addresses, e.g, 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.40. in addition, and this seems to have caused me the most problem, xp's firewall often automagically turns itself on, so in in the local area connection properties&gt;advanced, i disable the xp firewall. i have the most problems with my pro system. the 98 system never has a problem, lol. so much for 'upgrades'. hope this was of some help.
also, i've turned off all power management and screensavers, as i've read this can be an issue with a network.
