9298	5	255129	2532468	2532309	ikjadoon	7/5/07 5:52 pm	1.18365792e12	hmm...	do you know what model your motherboard is, by any chance? you can use this program to find out:  i'm going out on a limb here, but you don't have radios, cell phones, microwaves, etc.? try moving the speakers as far as you can from the computer and the monitor. any better? ~ibrahim~
9298	6	255129	2532886	2532468	wildbird	7/6/07 7:44 am	1.18370784e12	the problem has been solved	the sound problem has been solved. the computer's motherboard ga-k8nf-9 nforce4-4x chipset's manual audio driver is realtek so i have installed. vdo card is geforce 660gt 128mb memory. i got two cds the nvidia n force4 series utility cd and the winfast 3d graphics series. last night i installed agp update+nvidia+nforce+nforce amd since then realtek ac97 has been replaced by nvidia(r) nforce (tm) audio codec interface and then the problem has gone. as well as i lost the &quot;sound effect&quot; so i do not have feature for jack-sensing for audio connectors error-detecting function. the sound is pretty good and satisfactory but i do not know which driver is the right driver of the hardware of the machine, realtk or nvidia. regards, wildbird
