i have a dell inspiron 530 (not slim) and the specs are as followed: 2gb ram intel core 2 quad processor 2.4ghz windows 7 ultimate intel g33/g31 express chipset family my question is, can i upgrade my power supply in order to get new video cards. i really play some games. at least fallout 3 or something. if i can upgrade my power supply, then which is best and which is the best video card to go with it.
supply (psu) that can support it. you can start here ...  just make sure you have a pcie 16x slot to put it in and it fits in the case. vapcmd
so will the radeon hd 4670 work on my inspiron 530? will it work under the 350w psu that comes with my computer?
notes how many but you are pressing your luck here. if the psu is new and from dell or such i might try it but measure my pc total draw with a watt meter (i use a p3 watt meter.) bob
my pc is 2 years old... will any atx psu work with my pc? because i saw one with 600w and i might buy that one.. here is the link:
same mfg but lower overall cost (after rebate), longer warranty (5yr vs. 3yr) and slightly more wattage. recommend these highly.  vapcmd
