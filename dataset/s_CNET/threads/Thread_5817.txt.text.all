<s> so i'm sitting here at 2:49 am trying to lead a qa test for an mmo emulator, and building my christmas computer too.  </s>
<s> heres my question for every body, intel core 2 duo e6850 processor hh80557pj0804mgs - 3.0ghz, 4mb cache, 1333mhz fsb, conroe, dual-core, oem, socket 775, processor or intel core 2 quad q6600 processor hh80562ph0568m - 2.40ghz, 8mb cache, 1066mhz fsb, kentsfield, quad-core, oem, socket 775, processor the good old dual vs quad. the dual core has 1333mhz fsb, its also clocked 600 mhz higher although reviews say its overclocking power is nowhere near that of the q6600. the quad core has a slightly less fsb at 1066 mhz, but it is quad core which will be optimal for future support in gaming (hopefully) there have been reports of the q6600 being overclocked to 3.6ghz stable i believe.  </s>
<s> so which would you choose and why?  </s>
<s> the quad would be my choice for video editing and everything else i have.  </s>
<s> and the quad would get my nod for a gamer that will be running a &quot;server&quot; for the game.  </s>
<s> i decline to write about overclocking since when i get a machine that's been clocked we usually can fix it by setting it back to stock.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the q6600 with a mobo based on any of those chips will easily oc to 3ghz by selecting the 1333mhz fsb.  </s>
<s> with a good heatpipe based cooler, 3.4ghz can usually be reached without much fuss.  </s>
<s> from what i have read its going to be a while before program writers catch up to the quad core realm of gaming and in most tests the dual core processors are out performing or performing as well as the quad core for a cheaper price.  </s>
<s> either way you cant go wrong, its going to work well.  </s>
