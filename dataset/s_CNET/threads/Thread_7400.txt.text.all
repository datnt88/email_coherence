<s> has anyone used dban, how long does it take to wipe your hardrive?  </s>
<s> (please specify capacity etc).  </s>
<s> reason i'm asking is because the airport in my country normally checks all computers.  </s>
<s> i don't have anything immoral, only some pirated software (and the airport here makes issues and fines about that).  </s>
<s> i simply cannot afford to buy software!! so my plan is to launch dban when the authouraties decided to check my computer?  </s>
<s> do you think this could work in time?  </s>
<s> please advise.  </s>
<s> thanks dean  </s>
<s> dban is not a 'quick solution' and if you're waiting at customs at the airport expecting to be checked, you will not finish the process in time.  </s>
<s> that in itself would be suspicious and if i were a customs official i would begin investigating further if a traveller turned up with a laptop running dban or similar.  </s>
<s> i find your post rather strange.  </s>
<s> saying that you have &quot;pirated software which is not immoral&quot; is a matter of opinion.  </s>
<s> i find it immoral, and offensive.  </s>
<s> we don't discuss piracy in these forums and such discussions often get locked.  </s>
<s> but not only that, if you cannot afford to buy the software, then you don't use it.  </s>
<s> it is that simple.  </s>
<s> if you cannot afford to buy a car, do you steal it?  </s>
<s> if so that is a criminal offense in most countries, and to me software piracy is the same.  </s>
<s> you do realise that dban wipes everything? the whole hard disk.  </s>
<s> nothing survives.  </s>
<s> that's it from me but beware, i am tracking this discussion.  </s>
<s> any 'workarounds' or otherwise replies that i feel contravene forum policy and i will start deleting and will lock the post.  </s>
<s> mark  </s>
<s> being a part time computer and network tecnician as well as a systems administrator i know very well what piracy is! and yes i also know how dban works, all i wanted to know was an average of how long it takes to function.  </s>
<s> your argument is useless.  </s>
<s> first of all if a person can't afford a car there is always public transport.  </s>
<s> this is not always the case with software!!! i use many open source and freeware programs but there are still certain programs that i need which are neither of these and this is when i turn to piracy!  </s>
<s> (and this is not my will, i only use it because my university insists that i use certain programs!!) secondly.. i did not ask you for any pirated software!  </s>
<s> what i asked is how long a perfectly legal program will take to run.  </s>
<s> as i said your argument is useless.  </s>
<s> well now ill just use dban myself and see how long it takes rather than wasting the rest of my time arguing with you.  </s>
<s> as we can't discuss pirated software, this discussion is now closed.  </s>
<s> if you want to discuss dban, do that to avoid discussion locks.  </s>
<s> if you want to discuss justifying use of pirated goods then post that in another forum so you can get going on the topics.  </s>
