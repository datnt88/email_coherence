i recenetly had to wipe my hard drive. i am trying to reinstall my external ezhub external drive and can't get it to instal. i have the installation disk. when i try to run it i get an error that says &quot;can't open file d:\setup.exe access denied&quot;. can anyone offer some advise?
i've found a few borken'ed installers that we have to work around such things.
i have tried it in two different drives, still the same thing.
no os noted, is the os have it's own service packs installed, why was the os wiped, what &quot;protection software&quot;, any firewall, peer guardian and the list goes on and on. tell more. bob
i'm running windows xp. i have downloaded the latest smart pack. i have a firewall running, disk drives work for everything else. if this matters, when i restart my pc i get an box open up for the ez dub disk but then it tells me i need to install the nero software first. but when i try to load the installation cd i get the error message posted above.
maybe you need to uninstall ezdub, and install nero first? remember i don't have answers to why the os was reinstalled, if the reinstall has all the drivers for the machine and more. for example i'm working with assumptions such as the nero cd is the retail version. bob
