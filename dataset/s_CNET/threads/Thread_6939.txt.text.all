<s> i am screwed.... can any1 suggest any solution.... i think a few settings are missing.. but i dont have ny idea... plz help  </s>
<s> and you can use a boot floppy to see what happens.  </s>
<s> have you tried the bios jumper to reset the bios to the default??? is this a gigabyte mobo with the dual bios??? if so read the manual as to how to get the backup bios to be used.  </s>
<s> all mfr's say to only update the bios if it is needed to correct a specific problem that you are having and that the new bios is intended to correct.  </s>
<s> i know that robert tells everyone to update the bios, but it can be a risk. the gigabyte dual bios systems that i have seen have the cmos chips [2 of them] soldered in, thus getting a new chip is not likely, unless mobo is sent back to gigabyte.  </s>
<s> let us know what you find out.  </s>
<s> some mb show checksum error after update.  </s>
<s> you then have go into bios and redo all of the settings and save them and exit and restart.  </s>
