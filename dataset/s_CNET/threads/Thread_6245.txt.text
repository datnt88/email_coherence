hi all, i would like to buy a new advanced and powerful pc. the main purspose of this pc is programming, web researching and also i use some softwares like vb studio, sql, other softwares (some times i may use photoshop, seo softwares,other video editing softwares also) budget is 35000 inr, it may extend for better pc configuration a bit. no need to overclock. windows 7 or windows 8 operating system need to use. i am from india, hyderabad. presently i don't want for games but it should be compatible for later use. i need following components: processor (looking for amd phenom x6 processor as it can be in my budget, suggest me if you have better than this ) mother board ram- 8gb hdd- 1 tb case 20 inch or more good led monitor psu keyboard and mouse ups please suggest me...
you can hardly call a pc with an amd x6 processor &quot;advanced and powerful&quot;. it's a processor that came out more than 3 years ago. i'd call it &quot;entry level&quot;. kees
hi, thank you for your reply.... could you advise me a fastest pc under 35000 inr, suggest me good processor also.
alas, in europe and the usa we don't know the prices in shops and webshops in india. so i'm afraid it's up to you to find a few models you like and ask an opinion about them here. kees
hi, no problem, suggest me a good configuration as per your country rates. budget is around $ 580. you can suggest from any online shop. but pc should be very fast.
try the amd a10 line as you get fair gaming without having to pop for a gpu card. bob
could you please advise complete configuration. i do not play games now.
i'm not in your country. but an amd a10 delivers on many fronts with the cost being kept in check. here's my favorite i7 haswell and you can opt out of the ssd and video card if you need to.  bob
