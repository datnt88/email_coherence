can this be done? i need to use it for music. can i add something to my windows me?
you can pop in a knoppix cd and it will run qemu then linux and while windows me is running you could access the ntfs volume. but the glacial speed would test anyone i know. so while not impossible the solution is likely too slow for any practical reason. why not boot linux and copy out the files you want to the windows me hard disk?
a program like  it should allow you to copy the contents of the external drive to your local hard disk. to have better access to the disk, reformat it as fat32. kees
my old ntfsdos was strictly windows 98se and prior so its good to read they updated this tool.
