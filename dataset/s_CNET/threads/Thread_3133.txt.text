what does fsb mean??? my computer i ordered has a 2.53 gig processor. and i was wondering what it would be. like as in an 800 megaherts processor or something.
do a google for more information.
fsb :- front side bus but as the person who posted before me said, do a search on google for more info then you will understand what it is mate.....
i like this explanation:
the problem with looking up acronyms on google is sometimes the results are waay on the bottom. for me it was #8 or so. anyways, fsb is how fast data is carried to/from cpu to system ram. among one uses, i hear faster fsb speeds is better if you do alot of video editting and video related stuff. iirc, the fsb has to be a multiple of the system ram speed. more info below.
