<s> i'm not looking for speed.  </s>
<s> i'm looking for power and heat.  </s>
<s> 65mm intel is generally better than 90mm prescott i've heard.  </s>
<s> i can keep my computer running cooler and quieter.  </s>
<s> but i can't decide between a pentium d915 and a p4 631.  </s>
<s> forget about speed and cache, etc. but the 915 is 95w and the other i found is 65w.  </s>
<s> i found a 65w version. is the 30 watt difference enough to make my pc hotter.  </s>
<s> or 65mm is better in general and watts don't matter.  </s>
<s> thanks, confusimo  </s>
<s> but this is a close comparison.  </s>
<s> click on various benchmarks to get a generalized view of there performance.  </s>
<s> if you have special needs, maybe gaming, then run these comparisons as well.  </s>
<s> check with the intel web site most processors have special abilities that set them apart from one another.  </s>
<s> enhanced speed step for instance.  </s>
<s> generally dual cores are better then p4s because they process nearly twice the information that a single core does.  </s>
<s> this thread is untracked  </s>
<s> the cpu and what do you use the pc for mostly ?  </s>
<s> i'm talking about heat.  </s>
<s> not use and budget.  </s>
<s> does more power watts make more heat.  </s>
<s> or is the 65nm just more efficient than 90nm and 30watts is to little to make heat.  </s>
<s> nobody is fimiliar with power.  </s>
<s> anyhow i just won a 65w model on ebay so we'll see i guess.  </s>
<s> altho workload makes all the difference in heat dissipation.  </s>
<s> congratulations on your win.  </s>
<s> does the power consumption really enter anyone's mind (not me)?  </s>
<s> if one run into a heat problem then we just have to come up with a better cooling system.  </s>
<s> cooling is fine.  </s>
<s> prescott celeron d goes as low as 36c degrees.  </s>
<s> so i'm good now.  </s>
<s> but in order to keep it at that i to have turn all the fans at full blast and its very noisy and not to mention cold.  </s>
<s> but lower watts means less power and less heat.  </s>
<s> and i can put all my fans on low as soon i get the other cpu ands switch.  </s>
<s> won't be as noisy.  </s>
<s> and computer won't need to work so hard to cool.  </s>
<s> nobody is fimiliar with power.  </s>
<s> anyhow i just won a 65w model on ebay so we'll see i guess.  </s>
<s> my cpu runs at 20c idle and 30c light duty stuff.  </s>
<s> its 170$.  </s>
<s> because its 65w and 65nm.  </s>
<s> so it's just more powerfull.  </s>
<s> but mine should cool the same.  </s>
<s> just not as powerfull.  </s>
<s> it finally arrived.  </s>
<s> its a pentium 4 631.  </s>
<s> it's sl9kg according to the box.  </s>
<s> i forgot to look at the cpu.  </s>
<s> but it says so on the box.  </s>
<s> but its says 65nm according to cpuid.com.  </s>
<s> anyhow this thing is awesome.  </s>
<s> it says 18 - 20 c degrees in speedfan.  </s>
<s> and bios says about 25c degrees idol.  </s>
<s> not bad. and i even turned down all the fans.  </s>
<s> to low setting and i'm still getting those great temps.  </s>
<s> pretty cool for just a cpu change and nothing else.  </s>
<s> thanks, ivnj  </s>
