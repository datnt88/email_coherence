i have a lenovo desktop (model - lenovo 3000 q series 8822 11q). it has a 300 watts smps(psu). i'm planning to upgrade to a 400 watts smps. but, there's a problem. my lenovo smps has a 2-pin power slot for the lenovo lcd-tft monitor. does all smps have that slot ? or else then what should i do now?
if it isn't connected to anything on the motherboard, i don't see why there should be a problem. ~ibrahim~
my lenovo lcd-tft monitor is connected to that slot ,because the lenovo monitor gets the power from that slot present on the psu now what should i do ?
i thought this was a desktop. it is, but a small form factor desktop. i was kind of confused there, lol. i would say that the 400w *should* include it. where are you buying it from? might they list the connectors, like most sites? ~ibrahim~
