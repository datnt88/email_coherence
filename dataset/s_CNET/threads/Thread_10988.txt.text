i was given a custom built computer with xp pro. it has no plugs for keyboard or mouse only 3 usb plugs in back and 2 in front. i have tried plugging in a usb keyboard and a usb mouse in all but at boot in cmos it says &quot;no keyboard detected&quot; then &quot;no mouse detected&quot;. it then proceeds to the windows sign on screen wanting a password. i know the password but unable to enter or by pass the screen because keyboard and mouse are not recognized. any ideas?
they must have had a working k and m to install so ask them what works.
bob i did your suggestion first.unable to find the origional builder, that's why it was given to me. would installing a pci usb card work or do i need to get past the sign on screen first?
try some ps2 keyboard and in the bios set the usb keyboard support to enabled.
bob! as i stated this machine was custom built without any ps/2 connectors. i can't very well plug in a ps/2 keyboard without a place to plug it in.
or has some dell board (you have to reveal details like that.) you might consider recycling parts into a new machine that works. who's to say that all the usb ports are blown? and no, an usb pci card rarely works in this sort of blown board issue. bob
thanks bob. i appreciate you expert opinion.
1. reset the cmos with that jumper, etc. 2. beg, borrow a dell usb keyboard. 3. just the usb keyboard. no other devices.
