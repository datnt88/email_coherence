about three weeks ago i posted a problem with my hp pavillion xt853 that would not boot when powered up. some of you suggested that i replace the battery for my bios so i did. so far no luck, the only thing that i notice differently was the beep sequence that it gives when i first turn it on. it starts with one beep than two consecutive beeps twice and at the and one solo beep.(beep------beep,beep,beep-beep,beep,beep------beep) if you guys have any more suggestions i will greatly appreciate it. thanks for your help \ freddy
beep code 1-3-3-1 is memory sizing problem. check dram seating, if possible try one pair, or single dimm as appropriate, try different memory stick(s) if available. also could be the mother board.
holtr, i was originally thinking of just swapping the mother board and upgrading to a pentium 4. if i drift this way do you have any suggestions to what kind of board i should purchase. thanks for your help man freddy
that my friend is a memory problem, you have a bad stick of memory. if you have two sticks take one out try booting the machine again. if problem still, take the other one out put the first one back in.
my hp dv6700 laptop just stoped working and would not boot. it just beeped a few times but didnt boot up. i replaced the ram and its working perfect again thanks for the tip !!! mike
