<s> i need help with norton ghost 2003's clone tool.  </s>
<s> i have a 250gb hard drive all set up with windows xp and norton ghost.  </s>
<s> now i am trying to clone it to a brand new drive with no setup what so ever. the problem is, norton won't see the new drive.  </s>
<s> which is weird since i did the exact same thing a couple of minutes ago with another blank drive and it worked just fine.  </s>
<s> thanks ask if you need any more information.  </s>
<s> the issues there run deep.  </s>
<s> this is why i use g4u (see google) since it's all of 3 (three) words to type to copy a drive.  </s>
<s> it's also free.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks, you could have just told me that you have no idea.  </s>
<s> any way i figured it out. the destination drive wasn't partitioned right, here the failure to see the drive.  </s>
