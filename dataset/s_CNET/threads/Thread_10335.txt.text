i would like to perform a &quot;spring clearing&quot; for my 2 years old dell dimension e520 via dell pc restore. i have added a new hardware i.e pci nvidia vga card and wonder whether i should uninstall the card before i perform the pc restore task. can anyone advise me here? appreciate your help and feedback.
to get it out and use your default connection on the motherboard during the restore. then put it in again and install the drivers like you did sometime in the last 2 years. kees
this is my first time to do the pc restore and not very sure which is the best procedure. and hope i will get it done correctly..
hey pc restore takes back ur system to default settings n the easy way to do it is by start the computer when u see dell logo by holding ctrl key keep taping f11 n follow the steps
