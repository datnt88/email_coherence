<s> i have just got my hp d4100e with this motherboard installed (asus a8ae-le).  </s>
<s> it has two 512 modules installed.  </s>
<s> i want to install this &quot;corsair xms 1gb ddr, xms3200&quot; module.  </s>
<s> however, i'm not sure if i need to install two 1gb module into the first two channels and the two 512 in the second two?  </s>
<s> looking for some help  </s>
<s> if u have 2 doesnt really matter.  </s>
<s> wat do u need 3gb of memory for?  </s>
<s> or do u only have 1 module of corsair xms 1gb?  </s>
<s> if so since it is dual channel u will only get total of 1.5gb  </s>
<s> i only have one module of the corsair.  </s>
<s> by installing this in the far left channel and the two 512 modules in the next two channels, i will only get 1.5 gbs.  </s>
<s> i order to get 2 gbs, i would need another 1 gig stick.  </s>
<s> the problem is dual channel.  </s>
<s> u need to install ram in pairs.  </s>
<s> since u have 3, u can go either with what u have, 512 and 512, or 1gb and 512.  </s>
<s> if u get an additional 1gb module, u can have 1gb and 1gb and 512mb and 512mb occupying all 4 slots.  </s>
<s> have a happy holiday  </s>
