i may need to replace a cooling fan on my computer but i have no clue what type of fan i need to get. i know it is the processor fan and i got the part number off the fan but i can not seem to find that same fan. i am not at all a computer wiz, but i am learning. how do you tell what type of fan fits your computer? i have a v2 premier pentium 4 proc. 3.0ghz an810[e] motherboard the cooling fan is: foxconn dc brushless fan model#pv702012m i hope i have given all the important info not sure what else to give. thank you everyone for your time
fan for your cpu. i didn't have any luck finding the fan you specified thru google and intel uses many different fan configurations on their cpus. there are lots of places that sell the ... newegg.com carries a bunch of them and they describe them well. vapcmd
while you can replace the fan itself and do just fine, it appears you're clueless as to what to get. the fan itself is measured in &quot;mm&quot; so likely you want a 60mm or 80mm fan, but again i don't what you have regardless of the info you found on your fan. but, if you choose to, look at:  or similar websites. inquire the vendor if any fan or hsf you do get is suited for your needs and any return policy(surf abit). however, you'll do better getting a hsf(heatsink-fan setup) that is *rated* for your cpu/processor installed. so, if you have a 2.8mhz cpu, get a hsf that's rated for 2.8mhz or better and physically fits the location(in system) as some hsf are huge and maybe limited space to install or very tight fit. check this website for what to expect:  and locate info. tada -----willy
remove the fan.....not the heat sink. with fan in hand....visit your local mom+pop pc repair shop. place fan on counter and say&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i want one of these. with a little luck they will have something on the shelf that will work fine.
