hello! i want to make a bluetooth device which acts as a really small speaker. it would connect to a phone and have the option of making noise or not making noise. something really small which can attach to whatever. then you call it from your phone and it makes noise. does anyone know how to make this device?
the cost and engineering effort would scare off most folk. way back when i made my own bluetooth to rs232 device and can share a picture. but today it's cheaper to buy said thing. in this case, you either dive in to make it or buy it. no one should offer to put a course in electronics and programming in this small text box. bob
i have no idea where to begin. could you please point me to a good starting point? maybe let me know what i need to learn?
the usual college electronics and programming then decades in the electronics industry. today you could try using google to research this but i'm running into folk that think that such things can be condensed to fit in this small space or be re-written for every person. sorry i'm not that good. maybe you should search for a ready to use device? bob
have to convince me that i need one of the device. from what you have posted here, you have not convince me yet. it seems to me it has no real purpose at all. why &quot;makes noise&quot;? if this device can do a better job than what's already out there then i might consider buying one. maybe a little bit more thought is necessary though. good luck on your idea.
