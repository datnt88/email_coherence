hi, i am running windows xp, an asrock k7s41gx motherboard and am thinking of adding an extra hard drive as my present one of 40gig is getting a little small for me. is there any upper limit to the size of the extra hard drive that i fit 
you wrote &quot;xp&quot; so i can't know if you have the updates. 
notes other limitations which may be at play on your unnamed machine.
