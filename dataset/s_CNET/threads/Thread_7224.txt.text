does anyone know how to get a cd out of a rw drive if the cd slide tray will not come out when you push the button?
straighten a paperclip and insert it into the pinhole on the front of the drive to release the tray manually.
it varies with make or model but here's some pictures of some.  bob
thanks, that worked
