my linksys 802.11b router and four computers with various usb adapters worked fine for months. all of a sudden, two computers failed to connect. they saw a good signal from the router, but would not receive 'packets.' finally a nice lady at linksys' tech help told me how to enter the ip manually. why would xp's &quot;obtain ip address automatically&quot; function suddenly fail?
the most common reason i'm running into is this. the owner accepted a driver update from microsoft's windows update. bob
that makes sense; the computers that work okay have never asked for ms driver updates.
