<s> im going to need a pc that will run a few apps and probably a couple of games that dont require high-end graphics.  </s>
<s> i looked around and came up with these specifications: intel core 2 duo [2.6 ghz] ddr2 ram [2 gb] hard disk (sata) [250 gb] graphics card [256 mb] now, i'd like to know if this will do the job and also if there are any additional things that i'm going to need other than a case.  </s>
<s> everyone seems to forget the psu(power supply) and is taken for granted.  </s>
<s> all too often supplied with a new case while they work, may not for long or be underpowered.  </s>
<s> a decent system needs a good psu in order to remain stable and provide steady outputs.  </s>
<s> if you plan not to get into heavy gaming and generally a typical home system, a 500w+ psu will do fine.  </s>
<s> there are cheap offerings out there in the 500w range and when you look into the matter see the difference price makes and what will suit you.  </s>
<s> i take it seriously the lack of a decent psu in new systems, because of the reasons above.  </s>
<s> everything else you mentioned seems ok. use common sense and proceed, good luck.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> the configs are ok try to improve the vga and get somethng good, try some awesome multimedia accessories tooo  </s>
<s> be sure to get good ram don't get anything less than pc2 6400 and be sure its a decent brand like kingston or corsair.  </s>
<s> maybe upgrade the graphics card.  </s>
<s> two gigabytes can run a server and 256 megabytes can run a desktop and an emulated layer with games on each.  </s>
<s> like the thing you need would be under $450.  </s>
<s> if you can try to go for an nvidia geforce 9600gt graphics card with 512mb vram.  </s>
<s> make sure that the smps or psu (the power supply)is 500w or better.  </s>
<s> try to get a dvd writer, its helpful in data backup.  </s>
<s> if you're going to watch movies you can add a blu ray player at a later date when blu ray discs become mainstream.  </s>
<s> go for a decent 19&quot; lcd monitor or better  </s>
