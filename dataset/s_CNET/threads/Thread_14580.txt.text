i was at best buy today looking for a new monitor and found the samsung 215tw. as far as i can tell, this is a new product that should not be on the shelves yet. it is not yet on the us samsung website (although it is on the canadian site) and i have found only one site that has this as a pre-order. anyway, the price was good so i bought it and i was wondering if anyone knows anything about this product.
i need at least two of them for a dual moniter setup.
still haven't installed it, but it looked prety good at bestbuy...have you installed yours already? how does it look?
as you can see in the previous message, i just bought this samsung 215tw at bestbuy for $545 plus taxes and since i didn't see any reviews on this and bought it on the blind, i'm going to share my thoughts and impressions on this unit for your benefit as i think it might help you buy your lcd. my first impression was, &quot;pretty solid display&quot;. it did not come with any dead pixels or back light bleeding. i haven't calibrated it yet, but from what i can see it won't require any major adjustments. the screen displays crisp, well defined images. max resolution is 1680x1050. text is very readable as my wife pointed out since she does a lot of word, typing, etc. you can fit two word, or windows in it without a problem and it's very readable. as i'm typing i'm standing about 3 to 4 feet behind it and it's as good as it can get. its base holds the monitor securely and it doesn't vibrate as you adjust it. its height is decently adjustable, it tilts front and back, and it also rotates to the vertical, and i mean vertical, unlike some gateway reviews i've seen. all the menu buttons are on the front of the display, all its inputs/outputs are on the back and side for the extra audio/video/composite. it doesn't come with any usb ports if you're looking for that feature. it does come with the dvi cable, although it's not gold tipped, and the vga one. it also comes with a cd that contains drivers, rotation software which works perfectly, and a color/mode tool. it also has built in speakers that are decent for very basic ops. if you want something decent get it separately. what else. set up was easy and i' going to paste information that came with the cd for specs on the unit and i hope this helped you decide. general model name syncmaster 215tw lcd panel size 21&quot; wide diagonal (54 cm) display area 518.4 mm (h) x 324.0 mm (v) pixel pitch 0.270 mm (h) x 0.270 mm (v) type a-si tft active matrix synchronization horizontal 30 ~ 81 khz vertical 56 ~ 75 hz display color 16.7m colors (8bit) resolution optimum resolution wsxga 1680 x 1050 @ 60 hz (analog/digital) maximum resolution wsxga 1680 x 1050 @ 60 hz (analog/digital) input signal,terminated rgb analog, dvi compliant digital rgb 0.7 vp-p 5%,ttl level (v high 2.0v, v low 0.8v) video video format cvbs , s-video, component maximum pixel clock 165 mhz power supply ac 120 v 10 v, 60 hz or ac 220 v 20 v, 50 hz signal cable 15pin-to-15pin d-sub cable, detachable, 1.8 m dvi-d to dvi-d connector, detachable, 2.0 m (option) power consumption less than 70 w dimensions (wxdxh)/ weight with stand : 490 x 219.8 x 377 mm (19.3 x 8.7 x 14.8 inch) / 7.5 kg without stand : 490 x 72 x 342.5 mm (19.3 x 2.8 x 13.5 inch) vesa mounting interface 100 mm x 100 mm (for use with specialty(arm) mounting hardware.) environmental considerations operating temperature: 50f ~ 104f (10c ~ 40 c) humidity: 10% ~ 80%, non-condensing storage temperature: -4f ~ 113f (-20c ~ 45 c) humidity: 5% ~ 95%, non-condensing plug and play capability this monitor can be installed on any plug & play compatible system. interaction of the monitor and computer systems will provide the best operating conditions and monitor settings. in most cases, monitor installation will proceed automatically, unless the user wishes to select alternate settings. dot acceptable tft lcd panel manufactured by using advanced semiconductor technology with precision of 1ppm(one millionth) above is used for this product. but the pixels of red, green, blue and white color seem to be bright sometimes or some of black pixels could be seen. this is not from bad quality and you can use it without uneasiness. for example, the number of tft lcd sub pixels that is contained in this product are 5,292,000.
any idea why i can't get the volume to work on the 215tw? do i need a cable? i am using the analog cable and the picture is terrific but i have no sound. i've done all system checks so i have to imagine it's the monitor. any input would be appreciated!
if you look underneath your monitor, right by the dvi cable input there's an input for sound and that's where you need to hook the sound cable in.
so far this monitor has been great except for one problem. the 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode. i cannot get it to work in digital mode. instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output. i can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. is this expected or should i exchange the monitor? i was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card.
i am sometimes amazed by how technically inept i am - how embarrassing. thanks for your help!
i had exactly the same problem with an old video card. it seems that some early dvi video cards can't support 1680 by 1050 over the dvi port, but will do so over the vga port. i upgraded my video card and now have it working at 1680 by 1050 in dvi mode.
i also got this monitor, and one of the reasons i went for it over the similar lg monitor is that the samsung has the 3 video inputs. if you are looking for an hdtv, you should get an hdtv and not a computer monitor, but having the video inputs seemed useful to me. if you are looking at this monitor for its video inputs, you should be aware that the component video will only go up to a 480p signal. a &quot;film mode&quot; is available for interlaced video as well. the dvi port is hdcp compliant, so it looks like you might be able feed a hdtv signal to this monitor that way, but i can't find anywhere in the docs what hdtv resolution might be supported, if any. i'd guess 720p, but i do not have anything that makes a hdtv signal to test this with. anyway, i got this as a computer monitor and am very happy with it.
that was my suspicion since the specs specifically state it supports that resolution on both vga and dvi.
i too, bought this screen as soon as it got out even before samsung advertised it. funny thing is, i was calling them (samsung product support) from bestbuy to learn more because no one knew about it, and strangely enough, even samsung reps couldn't tell me anything. i had also the gateway fpd2185w, and let me tell you, it is crap compared to this samsung!! cnet's reviewers gave it close to 8 points, i thought it was exaggerated. this samsung supports high definition input through its component with resolutions of 480p 720p and 1080i. very crisp and vivid picture. i compared the gateway side by side, and the samsung takes the gateway out easily. i have tried it with the xbox 360 and boy i tell you it is wonderful. its 8ms refresh rate and 1000:1 contrast give you a superb quality. really, if you are looking to spend nearly $600, this is your monitor. it gives you 3 years (!) of warranty compared to lousy 1 year with gateway. oh yes also their sales and support suck and shameful. go for the samsung!!
i have a review of this monitor in the following thread at the anandtech forum:  here's my pbase images of various monitor tests:
