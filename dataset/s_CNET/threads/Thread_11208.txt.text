best buy has the t6212, a lexmark printer, and a 15&quot; flat panel monitor(e15t4). for $629.97. it is $80 more than the sale they had a few weeks ago, due to the upgrade to the flat panel monitor. is this a decent monitor for working with dvd's? its max. resolution is 1024 x 768.
&quot;emachines sells a small selection of monitors, and it included its new e15t4 lcd with our t6212 test system. the 15-inch flat panel provides a crisp, bright image and costs only $199 (after a $50 mail-in rebate). busy multitaskers might find the screen too small for daily use, but it's a great buy for a budget machine you spend time with only occasionally.&quot; from the t6212 review personally, i have emachines old monitor the e15t3 which is the same size as the new one. i have sampled wide-screen and full-screen dvds. the overall picture is pretty good but the screen is alittle small for watching movies in my opinion. if you plan on watching dvds alot i would get a larger monitor, but it would work.
jrmar explained it pretty well and how the emachine lcd flat panel monitor works with dvd. high end gamers prefer the old crt flat screen monitors over lcd as they claim faster response. recently i have read that lcd monitors have improved and the ones with 8mn response time is not that bad. the 15&quot; emachine e15t4 has 16ms response time with 1024x768 max resolution. newegg has an acer 17&quot; ali714cb-8 with 8ms and 1280x1024 max resolution for $229. the samsung 19&quot; 915n with 8ms and 1280x1024 resolution for $400 is also nice.
just casually checking...view sonic on a 4ms...
