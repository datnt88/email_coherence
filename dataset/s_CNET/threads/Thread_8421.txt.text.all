<s> i bought a linksys type n router a few years ago and thought i'd try to hook it up again now (i couldn't get it to work then either).  </s>
<s> there seems to be a compatibility issue between the router box and my wired verizon dsl modem, but it may be with my windows 7 laptop.  </s>
<s> i tried before on my xp desktop with similar results.  </s>
<s> does anyone have suggestions that don't involve more money?  </s>
<s> linksys wouldn't help without a fee, even though i've never called them before.  </s>
<s> boooo!  </s>
<s> let's see: - try to hook it up, no details about the cable(s) used - a linksys router, no type mentioned.  </s>
<s> - a wired verizon dsl modem, no type mentioned - there &quot;seems&quot; to be a compatibility issue, no details mentioned.  </s>
<s> - you tried both on your windows 7 laptop and on your xp desktop, but you don't tell what you tried.  </s>
<s> - you don't even mention if you tried that wired or wireless or both.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> there is a compatibility issue with the verizon firmware, the only way to get around it, if you can, is to contact verizon(frontier) and here we go again, good luck with that one.  </s>
<s> if anyone can get a straight answer from verizon, please let me know.  </s>
<s> it seems there was a transition a while back with verizon and frontier (the internet side) and their system is exteremely proprietary.  </s>
<s> ciscokid16 is not the only one having issues trying to use his/her own hardware.  </s>
<s> westell adsl2+ modem for verizon dsl linksys dual-band type n router new ethernet cables 2011 dell studio laptop dell 2005 desktop neither computer will work.  </s>
<s> on the connection drawing on them, it shows a red x between either the computer and the modem, or the computer and the router.  </s>
<s> i've followed the directions on the linksys disk every time.  </s>
<s> i don't know what else to say.  </s>
<s> sorry.  </s>
<s> is not the westell unit a dsl gateway?  </s>
<s> typically that is what verizon/frontier furnishes, at least recently.  </s>
<s> it is a combination unit wireless capable, modem/router in one unit, which would preclude the use of another router for general purposes.  </s>
<s> whereas if you were to use your linksys unit you would use a separate modem.  </s>
<s> the problem is dsl, your linksys router is set up for use with a cable modem, which is a different ball game.  </s>
<s> that is i guess you could say, a &quot;gotcha&quot; with verizon/frontier dsl hook ups since they are fed by a phone link instead of cable. is there a work around?  </s>
<s> well that's the question for verizon/frontier, i would love to hear their answer to this one.  </s>
<s> it goes to firmware and of course hook up(s).  </s>
<s> what i meant to say is that your linksys router is used generally with a cable modem, tapped off to the router via ethernet but not with a phone link as is the hook up for dsl.  </s>
