hi, i haven't used my presario in about 7 months now. after trying to play terminator 3 the computer would lock up and i would get graphic errors. so i uninstalled terminator. then my screen started to show lines through it and it would lock up. finally, my monitor could no longer read my computer. my computer remained on but nothing would show on the monitor. at first i thought it was my ati radeon video card. so i removed it and uninstalled the drivers. that didn't work. i could turn on my computer but then the screen would freeze, show lines through the screen and then my monitor couldn't read my computer. i then tried a different monitor. it didn't make a difference. so i did a quick restore on my computer. it worked for about 20 minutes and then it happened again. i think the cooling fans may be bad. they make a strained noise, but they still blow air. i just can't figure it out. today i restored it to the last known working configuration. it worked for an hour. please help!!!
leave the cover off and see if it makes a difference. if so, replace the failing fans. bob
i was thinking it could be the power supply or the fans. i will try that.
