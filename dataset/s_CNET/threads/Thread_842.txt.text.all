<s> hello ibrahim, thank you for the advice.  </s>

<s> i have been trying to find out a solution by googling too but i found a lot of similar problems but their solution is not fix the problem.  </s>
<s> just i sent a mail to realtek to get some help.  </s>
<s> i do not know now whether it is a hardware problem or driver problem.  </s>

<s> it might be hardware.  </s>

<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>

<s> any better?  </s>
<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>
<s> the sound problem has been solved.  </s>
<s> the computer's motherboard ga-k8nf-9 nforce4-4x chipset's manual audio driver is realtek so i have installed.  </s>
<s> vdo card is geforce 660gt 128mb memory.  </s>
<s> i got two cds the nvidia n force4 series utility cd and the winfast 3d graphics series.  </s>
<s> last night i installed agp update+nvidia+nforce+nforce amd since then realtek ac97 has been replaced by nvidia(r) nforce (tm) audio codec interface and then the problem has gone.  </s>
<s> as well as i lost the &quot;sound effect&quot; so i do not have feature for jack-sensing for audio connectors error-detecting function.  </s>
<s> the sound is pretty good and satisfactory but i do not know which driver is the right driver of the hardware of the machine, realtk or nvidia.  </s>
<s> regards, wildbird  </s>
<s> well, i'm glad it is solved.  </s>
<s> i actually didn't know nvidia made sound drivers, weird!  </s>
<s> i'm pretty certain realtek drivers are the correct ones, but if they are working ok with nvidia, i wouldn't mess with them.  </s>
<s> good job!  </s>
