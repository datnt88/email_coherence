guys i'm from india and under offer new msi x340 is being sold for $450 at ebay india.should i get it? here's the link -  thanks.
x340 owners.please tell me whether i should get this notebook or not.thanks
for that amount we get new laptops without the netbook limitations. my answer is no sale. bob
i don't need a full size laptop.just a netbook for blogging. its quite slim and lightweight with big display. if not this which netbook would you recommend? thanks.
i would look at the acer timeline in that class machine. only a masochist would use a netbook for very long. bob
