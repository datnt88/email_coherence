<s> if you read my other post my pc is messed up but the hard drive is perfectly fine.  </s>
<s> now there are some very important files on there and i was wondering that if i were to put that hard drive in my dad's pc, what will happened?  </s>
<s> his pc has xp and xp is also on my hard drive.  </s>
<s> i was wondering if there is a way i can just get the files out of there?  </s>
<s> because if i can just get the files i can then move them to my dad's hard drive and erase what on my hard drive and then add it as more storage to another pc  </s>
<s> done it myself.  </s>
<s> just make sure your hd is set for slave.  </s>
<s> xp will see it as just another drive.  </s>
<s> copy what you wish, then do what you want.  </s>
<s> your logic is correct.  </s>
<s> good luck, give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the internet and they won't bother you for weeks.  </s>
<s> click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections and data, and download free software.  </s>
<s> good thing for me.  </s>
<s> so all i need to do is set it up as a slave and then i will not have any other files?  </s>
<s> one thing though.  </s>
<s> on my pc that got messed up i had accounts with password.  </s>
<s> someone could not see someones else accounts(like thier desktop, documents, folders) will i be able to see them after setting it up as a slave?  </s>
<s> but i've never looked for that type of stuff.  </s>
<s> give it a shot, it'll either work or it won't.  </s>
