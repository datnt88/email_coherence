<s> whenever i play dos based games and games like nfs most wanted and gta vice city, my pc's cpu usage goes up to 100% and cpu fan produces a lot of sound.  </s>
<s> this does not happen when i use other apps.  </s>
<s> atlast, the system turns off.  </s>
<s> i have a pc with pentium iv processor 512 mb ram, 80 gb hd, d101ggc motherboard please help me with some solutions.  </s>
<s> as that's how it is supposed to work there is nothing to fix here. the cpu fan is supposed to make more noise in this sort of system.  </s>
<s> again, nothing busted here.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> sounds as if you could stand a hardware upgrade.  </s>
<s> firstly another 512(preferably more) of ram.  </s>
<s> a standalone video card, 256mb(512 preferably) and more importantly a heavier psu.  </s>
<s> the 100%....normal.  </s>
<s> cpu fan sound....normal.  </s>
<s> system turns off....not normal.  </s>
<s> perhaps it's time to open the machine and do some cleaning.  </s>
<s> get all the dust out of the machine.  </s>
<s> get all those fans and heat sinks nice and spiffy.  </s>
<s> watch  </s>
<s> an underpowered system running taxing games.  </s>
<s> what exactly is the processor speed?  </s>
<s> it reads to me like it's a ddr sdram system, thus, is the system meeting the minimum requirements for the games?  </s>
<s> as the previous poster have mention, the sytem could do use some upgrade of memory, and powerful power supply unit, and also, better graphic card if you hadn't used one.  </s>
