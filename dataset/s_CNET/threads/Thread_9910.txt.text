hello all, im here looking for some really good help on building up a new desktop. i just got an very old desktop that has basically nothing in it. the hard drive only has 7gb max, 128mb of ram, i odnt think theres a sound card or w/e. so yeah its pretty old and 'basic'. i want to upgrade everything but really dont know where to start; should i start with the hard drive? a new mobo, or start with ram? i dont wanna dish out thousands of dollars, i just want something that decent for gaming and entertainment and doing shcool stuff. so any simple help on where i should start would be great.
you cannot simply upgrade your system as you go. do not toss your computer as you may find it fun to play with it later learning about different oss without having to mess with dual booting. you can also make it into a router, nas, print server, wifi router, usb hub etc. if you lay down a price i'll help you build one on newegg.
good starting point...mix and match as the budget allows. vapcmd
you ram, motherboard, power supply unit and cpu all have to be compatible. compatitbility comes in generations. by slowly upgrading you would lose a lot of bang for your buck. whilst just replacing would be an effective way to get a nice computer. also please list any games you would actually want to play. you can look up the recommended hardware for the game you want to play and keep those specs in mind when picking out parts.
