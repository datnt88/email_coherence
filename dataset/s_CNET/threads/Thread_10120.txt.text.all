<s> i am looking on ebay at a ready assembled desktop pc in a couple of different configurations all of which are designed around gaming.  </s>
<s> i have a budget limit of $1050 and have run into a few questions regarding motherboard and case.  </s>
<s> i will supply my own operating system, keyboard, mouse and screen.  </s>
<s> the general build goes as follows: cpu - ivy bridge intel i5 3570k ram - 8gb ddr3 1333mhz hdd - 1gb sata iii hard drive motherboard - b75m pro or for $50 more 4th gen z77 pro dvdrw - generic case - generic with 2 usb ports at the front or thermaltake v3 for $30 or v4 for $55 gpu - 1g gtx 660 power supply - generic 850w here is the link -  </s>
<s> i see you read about the cpu for gaming.  </s>
<s> i'll copy it again here.  </s>
<s> &quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.  </s>
<s> it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines.  </s>
<s> &quot; the video card might be changed.  </s>
<s> i'd see how high i can go on this list. the psu is something of a problem area. is it a single rail?  </s>
<s> if not are you sure you won't exceed the amperes of any rail?  </s>
<s> part of the reason of getting a single rail is for folk that don't want to learn about this.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> case....get a mid tower.  </s>
<s> &quot;bling&quot; drives the price on these things.......how much 'bling' do you want?  </s>
<s> for me a 20 buck generic works fine.....your call.  </s>
<s> mobo......get an atx......not a micro atx.  </s>
<s> brand.....i doubt it makes much difference.  </s>
<s> look at the features of both and see if something jumps at you.  </s>
<s> gpu.....i see you can get a hd 7850 for about the same bucks.  </s>
<s> that would be my choice.  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply bob, yeah i initially was going to get an i7 just because i assumed it would be the best as its intels highest chipset but the more i looked into it the less and less important it seemed to be for gaming purposes.  </s>
<s> for hd video rendering and 3d modeling yeah sure, go the i7 but for gaming it just wasn't necessary i emailed the seller asking if he could supply a radeon 7870 but if not unfortunately the options only go up to radeon 7850.  </s>
<s> which is better out of the radeon 7850 and gtx 660 (non ti version).  </s>
<s> i'm reading a lot of conflicting reviews i'm not sure with the psu, i'm assuming they will look at the parts i will request and put in something that can handle it.  </s>
<s> surely they wouldn't give me a fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> threads psu when the rest of the rig will be somewhat power hungry because when it melts 2 days after they supply it i'll just be returning it...obviously not what a business wants.  </s>
<s> don't the more expensive towers come with more/better fans?  </s>
<s> this is going to run kinda warm isn't it?  </s>
<s> so i want to keep it nice and cool.  </s>
<s> i plan to game at full hd resolution with bf3 being my benchmark game.  </s>
<s> hoping to run it on ultra or near to that settings at 30+ fps.  </s>
<s> would you still reccomend the hd 7850 over the gtx 660 (non ti version) for this resolution?  </s>
<s> i see people are saying the hd 7550/7870 really come into their own element at higher resolutions than this but that full hd and under that the gtx 660 would be better?  </s>
<s> would you agree with that ?  </s>
<s> take the side cover off and then you won't need all those more/better/noisy fans.  </s>
<s> gpu......i think both those cards are pretty close.....since your cost is the same for either...... this might come down to splitting hairs.  </s>
<s> i still opt for the hd 7850.....more bandwidth.  </s>
<s> it might be best to get the 2gb model if your planning on using max settings.  </s>
