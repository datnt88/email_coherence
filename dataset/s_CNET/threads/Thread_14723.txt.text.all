just wondering if someone could help me decide on an inexpensive mobo upgrade. the asus p7h55-m pro is on sale at newegg for $85, i'm mostly interested in it's overclocking features (dell board is locked. 
while the reviews are pretty good, my main concerns would be the graphics card (radeon 5750) fitting on the mobo and the lack of cooling in the xps case (i'm going to replace the case next when have the $). any help would be appreciated.

wrong link above, here si the correct link: 
the dell supplied os is often locked to dell boards. 
brace yourself for a purchase of windows if your dell supplied os does not install.
