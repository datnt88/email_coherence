i am building a new system. 
my question is can i copy everything from my old harddrive to a newone. 
i want to do this so i wouldnt have to buy a full version of xp. will this work? 
will my old computer be left unharmed? 
your new pc will have different hardware and need different low-level drivers, so windows probably won't even start. 
even if it does, the os will detect that your hardware has changed and require re-activation. 
the xp license is only good for one computer. 
a full reatil xp license allows you to install xp on a different computer, but it must be removed from the old one. 
aside: copying files or a disk image from an old computer doesn't damage the old computer.
