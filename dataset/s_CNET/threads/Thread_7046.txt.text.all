<s> i am building a new system.  </s>
<s> my question is can i copy everything from my old harddrive to a newone.  </s>
<s> i want to do this so i wouldnt have to buy a full version of xp. will this work?  </s>
<s> will my old computer be left unharmed?  </s>
<s> your new pc will have different hardware and need different low-level drivers, so windows probably won't even start.  </s>
<s> even if it does, the os will detect that your hardware has changed and require re-activation.  </s>
<s> the xp license is only good for one computer.  </s>
<s> a full reatil xp license allows you to install xp on a different computer, but it must be removed from the old one.  </s>
<s> aside: copying files or a disk image from an old computer doesn't damage the old computer.  </s>
