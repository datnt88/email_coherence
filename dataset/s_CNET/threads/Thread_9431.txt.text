remove case cover and point a fan at the open case. tell the forum if it's better or worse. bob
did not change anything. i do use msi afterburner and my temps never get higher than 70 running any game. so temperature is not an issue. plus this happens the moment i get into the game, so there is a very small window for my gpu to reach overheated temps, which i don't think is happening. i really can't find anyone else who has had this exact problem in my video before. highly frustrating!
here is another video that shows the problem off better  it really seems like it is a graphics card problem but i can't be sure.
that's the issue with the pc. as it stands you have to swap parts to figure it out about half the time. this is one of those times. there is one issue i encounter too often. that is, those that overclock usually can't be helped. it may upset a few but that's going out on a limb. few will join you. bob
