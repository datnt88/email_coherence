<s> both of these two ram sticks seem to have the same specs so why are the sniper ones more expensive?  </s>
<s> is there any difference or is this just a marketing ploy?  </s>
<s> the parts look to be selling on looks and name.  </s>
<s> marketing is keen to build on looks and names to fetch a price.  </s>
<s> yes, there are folk that build a machine for looks, inside and out!  </s>

<s> well, same ram but different sellers.  </s>
<s> providing if all specs remain the same, the sum total of price will be based on the degree of &quot;gee whiz&quot; factor.  </s>
<s> that would include the testing, heat dissipation(alloys), and then the color and/or looks.  </s>
<s> it's not what you all see that's apparent, because testing for &quot;every module&quot; you pay for rather than a sampling test. the best attached cooling fins, is yet another step and/or whatever is provided.  </s>
<s> next, while color isn't always helpful, it maybe more a selling point to include any led lightings.  </s>
<s> last, if ever needed, the warranty while present maybe more forgiving in order to appease those that make wrong choices or along those lines.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> one vendor may cut out support and charge a restocking fee (lower prices.) the other may have great staff and free return policies (higher prices.) since no two businesses are exactly alike, the price can change.  </s>
