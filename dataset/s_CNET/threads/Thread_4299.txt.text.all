<s> i have a presario 5000us and would like to change the factory installed motherboard with a new motherboard/cpu combo upgrade.  </s>
<s> does anyone know a good motherboard that would be compatible with this compaq model.  </s>
<s> i am told there can be issues with power supply hook-ups and alignment.  </s>
<s> i can't spend a fortune right now and this looked like a good way to upgrade without buying an entirely new system.  </s>
<s> everything else on the unit is up to date.  </s>
<s> it is a standard a-slot, atx board with a 750 mhz duron chip.  </s>
<s> any help would really be appreciated. the hp site wasn't a big help?  </s>
<s> thanks, dave  </s>
<s> the power supply was only sized to power what hp/compaq provided.  </s>
<s> i.e. if you upsize to some over 1 ghz cpu and such, then you have to upsize the power supply to match. is a starting point to see that you want to avoid the 350 watt power units and skip right to 450 to just remove this from your issue list.  </s>
<s> another issue is heat. the hp/compaq case was again for a 700 or so mhz cpu with so many watts to let so much heat out.  </s>
<s> you'll likely to have to rework the metal to fit another case fan too.  </s>
<s> power tools and tin snips are handy for this work.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> consider getting a new case and moving the hardware you want to keep to it, that may be a lot easier than trying to update an old case with a new motherboard.  </s>
<s> i appreciate the quick reply.  </s>
<s> after doing some more research i was starting to think the same thing.  </s>
<s> switching everything over to a new case sounds more like a better option.  </s>
<s> thanks again, dave  </s>
<s> thanks, i appreciate the all the quick replies.  </s>
<s> i may just take all the hardware i have a switching it to a new case.  </s>
<s> it's kind of like remodeling an old house.  </s>
<s> it costs more to rework the old than to just build new.  </s>
<s> all my other hardware is new except for the old motherboard and cpu.  </s>
<s> i'll have to change ram types however.  </s>
<s> i guess that's what e-bay is for.  </s>
<s> thanks, dave  </s>
<s> hi might want to try this site for memory might cast a little more but you will have what you need.  </s>
