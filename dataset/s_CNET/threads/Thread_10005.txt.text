i have an radeon x1650 pro video card, there is an s-video on it, i want to know if it is in and out or just out s-video. i sent an email to amd, never an answer. i have seen two different answers to this, i do not have the disk to read the manual. i want to connect a video player to copy a couple of videos to cd. i want to avoid buying dazzle or other equipment if possible. thanks.
video capture is a rare item and given so little detail i'm answering with &quot;no, it's just an ouput.&quot; bob
vivo=video in, video out the x1650 is capable of vivo but not all manufacturers implemented it. you need to check the specs of your card on your manufacturer's website to see if your card has vivo. if it does, your video editting/capture app needs to be able to support the x1650 as an input device.
