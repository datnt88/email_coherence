<s> i have a radeon 9550 video card with the latest drivers and catalyst control center installed.  </s>
<s> i bought a s-video cable for $5 and connected it from the back of the video card to my 27 inch sony tv. the problem is that the catalyst software doesn't detect the television.  </s>
<s> what should i do?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> unlike the f-type connection there is no signal to tell a pc that a connection was made via rca or svideo.  </s>
<s> skip past all that &quot;detection&quot; and ask them how to turn it on.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> them who?  </s>
