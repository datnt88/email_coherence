i have a radeon 9550 video card with the latest drivers and catalyst control center installed. 
i bought a s-video cable for $5 and connected it from the back of the video card to my 27 inch sony tv. the problem is that the catalyst software doesn't detect the television. 
what should i do? 
thank you. 
unlike the f-type connection there is no signal to tell a pc that a connection was made via rca or svideo. 
skip past all that &quot;detection&quot; and ask them how to turn it on. 
bob 
them who?
