bare with me guys and gals, i am at work and to not have direct access to my computer but have a slight issue. i bought a sony vaio new august of 2004. great computer! i have nero installed with dvd shrink. whenever i go to burn a dvd, it burns 100% succesful but when i play it it play the first 30 sec broken up than cuts off (stops). i am using memorex 8x dvd's, is it possible that i just did not adjust the burn settings on nero and just burning to fast(write speed) any help would be great!
the sound was cut off and would not play with the computer(sony rs xxxx). do you mean it doesnt work on the pc, or in tv dvd players? konny
it plays and sounds perfect on the computer, will not read on my dvd player.
