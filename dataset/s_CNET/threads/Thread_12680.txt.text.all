<s> i was wondering if i am doing something wrong.  </s>
<s> i am connecting my cyber home ch-dvd 300 via component video out, into a monitor with a vga only input. the cable i am using is the hdtv rgb/15 pin to 3 rca component video cable.  </s>
<s> there also is a male vga to 2 female vga &quot;splitter&quot; that is connected to the monitor.  </s>
<s> i am running audio out rca and i can hear the program just fine, i just can't see it.  </s>
<s> my computer is connected to the other side of the splitter and it works just fine, however when i have both the computer connected and turned on, and the dvd player there seems to be a signal interruption, which is leading me to believe i can make this work. the other part of this equation is that on the vga side of the component cable, there is a pin in the middle that is missing.  </s>
<s> i hope someone can help me.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> my motto has always been...why look for trouble when there ain't none?  </s>
<s> you have component out.  </s>
<s> what input connection/s do you have on the tv?  </s>
<s> vga is the only input, if i had multiple inputs i would try them.  </s>
<s> oh well.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> let me know your thoughts.  </s>
<s> what you are trying to do.  </s>
<s> my suggestion is to watch dvd/video through the computer or just plug and unplug your source.  </s>
<s> my guess is that your y-method of connection is not going to work.  </s>
<s> a switching box might work better but i don't know if they sell such device though.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> the reason i am trying to do this is so i can give my computer a rest.  </s>
<s> i run a video editing software quite a few hours a day and i'd like to give my computer a rest, if possible.  </s>
<s> one of the pins of the component to vga cable was broken off.  </s>
<s> i ordered a new cable, it should be here within the next day or two, i'll let you know if it works, if you even care, haha.  </s>
<s> thanks again for all the help!  </s>
<s> have a good one.  </s>
<s> at first i thought you were having some digital to analog problem.  </s>
<s> but i don't really think that is the problem.  </s>
<s> i read the htpc forums on the net, and i imagine the computer just won't accept the signal.  </s>
<s> you will see on amazon.com that many people buy wires trying different task you would think will work, but then they don't.  </s>
<s> lots of the converter adaptors and wires have low ratings because of this fact.  </s>
<s> they usually convert one way only.  </s>
<s> many times displays just don't accept the signal because of some silly reason that takes a degree to understand.  </s>
<s> try amazon.com or avsforums and you might find the answer faster.  </s>
<s> i had the same problem too, and i'm using a cyberhome ch-dvd 300 dvd player as well.  </s>
<s> i've used it fine with older tvs using a yellow jack composite cable with audio cables, so i didn't think it was the player.  </s>
<s> but it is! the trick is that this model dvd player is factory set so that it only recognizes s-video outputs without considering other good connections!  </s>
<s> you need to go into the setup menu to change it out.  </s>
<s> on the remote, press the setup button (top row, third button) to access the menu.  </s>
<s> then move the arrow to the right to choose the video option and press enter.  </s>
<s> then move the arrows to the video output option and choose the ycbcr option!  </s>
<s> if the original poster is still experiencing the problem, try this solution!  </s>
<s> i racked my brain trying to figure out what was wrong and only came across this solution after looking at troubleshooting for the player itself.  </s>
<s> reviewers at epinions have noted similiar problems and this solution working for them.  </s>
