i'm ready to purchase a new desktop and i have found a few that i am interested in. which of these processors would have the quickest performance? 2.2ghz athlon xp 3200+ 2.4ghz athlon 64 3300+ 3.0ghz intel pentium 4
for sure go with the athlon 64..it is so much better than the other 2
really i should have titled my post &quot;which computer processor package should i purchase?&quot;. i've been using a computer that has a 900mhz intel celeron processor for the past 4 years and i want a new faster computer and don't want another piece of junk.
no cantest.
i think i meant 'no contest'.
in test by tomshardware the 2.4ghz athlon 64 3300 and the 3.0ghz intel p4 are pretty closely matched, but both outperform/faster than the 2.2ghz athlon xp3200. in their test of the 2.4 ghz athlon 64 3300 it is generally a little faster in games than the 3.0ghz intel p4, but the intel 3.0 p4 did go faster in the wolfenstein, quake3 arena, and aqua mark3 games. however, imo you would not personally be able to tell the difference in their speed based on the processor alone, without instruments.
since the market is going on to the support of 64bit systems, and applications are whining down to reach the 64 bit mark, consider having the athlon 64 but the problem is that, not all softwares and/or applications do support the 64bit era. it could run the 32 bit apps (no doubt about it) try considering something that you would not regret in the long run.
in just the past 4 years even laptop computers have become twice as powerful as mine. thanks for the information!
i am currently doing research on a new computer. i suggest the athlon 64 socket 939 and compatible socket 939 motherboard. it appears that socket &quot;a&quot; is going away, socket754 will be for semprons and socket 939 for athlon 64. you no longer have to buy the high end athlon 64 for socket 939 as it is available in the athlon 64 3000+ on up. go with the latest technology to avoid premature obsolesence:)
amd athlon64 is perfect for playing games
i don't play video games but i do sometimes like to listen to the radio and watch news clips on windows media player and real player. would having a 64 bit processor be an asset for this? and would having a 64 bit processor slow a computers basic operations? i'm going to want to burn cds also.
it would be hard to purchase a too slow machine for what you write. but many will look back next year and may have wished to have made a 64-bit decision. it's a 2005-2006 type issue. bob
