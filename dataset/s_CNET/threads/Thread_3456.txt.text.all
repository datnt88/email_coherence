<s> i am running winxp prof and have sp2 installed.  </s>
<s> i purchased a belkin 802.11g wireless card for the desktop but it is not recognized as a device.  </s>
<s> i tried to search for new hardware and no luck.  </s>
<s> can this be a sp2 problem?  </s>
<s> i know the slots are working because it will recognize other cards.  </s>
<s> (nic and sound card).  </s>
<s> i also know the wireless card works because i installed in another machine and it detected.  </s>
<s> the only thing was the 2nd machine was a dell without sp2 installed.  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> &quot;i tried to search for new hardware and no luck.  </s>
<s> can this be a sp2 problem?&quot; i'm used to installed drivers for such things.  </s>
<s> your post didn't tell, but let me share that dell preloads some drivers so you don't have to.  </s>
<s> a stock install of xp will not have the drivers.  </s>

<s> thanks bob. the machine i'm having problems with is not a dell but just a generic machine.  </s>
<s> i have the disk with the drivers and they are installed on the generic machine.  </s>
<s> it seems like the pc doesn't even see the card.  </s>
<s> &quot;generic machines&quot; may use a motherboard with a chipset that microsoft may run on but you need to have latest bios and a motherboard driver package before cards or usb things work properly.  </s>
<s> your post didn't share the information so i can't tell if this is the issue.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the motherboad has vb-601 on it and on the corner there is a label which has mi413s.  </s>
<s> the bios is award modular bios 4.51pg.  </s>
<s> it says verison: mi413 award plug and play bios extension v1.0a  </s>
<s> if this is a bx based board (only you will know) then this google... seems to agree, the issue can be.. 1. you need the latest bios.  </s>
<s> 2. you need to &quot;reset configuration data&quot; in the bios.  </s>
<s> 3. you try another pci slot since... the one next the agp can be ... problematic.  </s>
<s> 4. the card is just incompatible with this board.  </s>
<s> 5. someone disabled the irq pnp features in the os. i offer this since i lost a day over that. the owner was thinking dos days where irqs couldn't be shared.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> this info doesn't give us a clue about the age of the system.  </s>
<s> what processor is in it, how old is it?  </s>
<s> the pc is probably from 1999 or so.  </s>
<s> i got it from a friend and put a pentium iii 500mhz processor and it has 768 of ram.  </s>
<s> i tried all the pci slots and also verified the pnp option in the cmos is enabled.  </s>
<s> i flashed the bios using the mi413 one from this site: .  </s>
<s> i also uninstalled sp2 and reinstalled xp without any luck.  </s>
<s> it would be amazing to expect owners to exchange cards, do such gyrations on drivers and more.  </s>
<s> you should try another card.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have a dell d610 running win xp2. the wireless card is a dell 1470.  </s>
<s> i pulled the card and installed in another d610 and have wireless internet on that machine.i then took the good card and installed it in the 1st d610.  </s>
<s> no wireless internet.  </s>
<s> i plugged in an ethernet cable to get internet.  </s>
<s> no problem.  </s>
<s> i reformatted the hard drive ,did a fresh install,checked the bios and upgraded to a06 and still no wireless.  </s>
<s> any thoughts on this problem?  </s>
<s> digging up a 5 year old post doesn't give you the right exposure.  </s>
<s> try a new post with the story and details.  </s>
<s> new post completed on nov.4th 9:04am thanks  </s>
