my friend has this hp pavilion 7935 desktop pc which came with winxp, 1.3 ghz amd, 128 mb ram. he had some problems with it and now, after a format, he has win2k pro on one of two partitions. the display adapter has been installed after heavy searching. the network adapter was automatically installed by win2k. now i need to install the modem and audio drivers but don't know the manufacturer/model. the hp site was not helpful. does anyone know this machine (hp pavilion 7935) and what modem and sound card it has? or do you know a utility that will tell me the manufacturer/model/make etc. of the hardware before it has been installed and working? belarc only tells me stuff about hardware that is already installed with the correct drivers. i need to install the drivers for the modem and the sound card but don't know the manufacturer/make/model etc. in order to do a search.
look in the hp support forums. you find discussions like this one:  bob
strange you can't find the driver for the modem, just going to the hp driver site, putting in pavilion 7935, immediately brings me to the xp drivers and shows a modem driver specifically.  they also have a driver recover capability that you run using these instructions
that link helped. thanx bob dude. i got sound! i have yet to check the modem.
