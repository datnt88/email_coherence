<s> we have a d-link wireless 11n router.  </s>
<s> we use it very successfully with an acer win7 wireless 11n laptop, and we now have a 2wire brand 11b wireless ethernet adapter (to connect a bluray player to the network, but not yet installed).  </s>
<s> will the addition of the 11b device slow down the speed of the separate 11n connection.  </s>
<s> ...just a general question about mixing 11x devices on an 11n router.  </s>
<s> if i have to get model numbers i can do so.  </s>
<s> (actually, this question is for a neighbor.)  </s>
<s> and not to repeat why let's skip to the cheapest possible solution.  </s>
<s> read post 18 (and 19?) of this forum's sticky.  </s>

<s> i looked in the &quot;sticky&quot; thread(s) and i did not see a reference in the link in reply 18(19) about mixing wireless protocols on the same network.  </s>
<s> sorry to be so ignorant.  </s>
<s> but i think your simple &quot;yes&quot; tells me what i need to know (but did want to hear).  </s>
<s> thanks very much for your response!  </s>
<s> was about how to use a router as a wap (see ) by using any old router as a wap for the 802.11b traffic we not only extend/expand our wifi traffic capability but keep the 802.11g/n traffic from getting hit with the slowdown.  </s>
<s> it's my cheap fix.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i think you are advising that i should find another wireless router (such as an 11b) and chain it to my dsl via the existing 11n wireless router.  </s>
<s> that is, the new wireless router will be wired via a short ethernet cable to an ethernet port on the existing 11n router, which is still wired via ethernet cable to the dsl. the result, if i can configure it all right, would be 2 wireless signal choices in the home, one 11n and another 11b (if the new router is 11b) and then i could connect the wireless 11b bridge to the 11b signal, and leave the 11n laptop connected to the 11n router.  </s>
<s> that sounds like a great suggestion!  </s>
<s> ...but i fear it might be more complex than my capabilities (or time to do it).  </s>
<s> i know nothing about ip and mac data but something tells me i would need to learn about that before doing such as that. is it possible that it might work in a plug-and-play way?  </s>
<s> ...that is, if i plug the new router into the exisitng 11n router, will the ip addresses come out ok by default?  </s>
<s> thanks so much for the response, though.  </s>
<s> if we use that method i will advise how it came out.  </s>
<s> is in this forum's sticky at posts 18, 19. to save members from repeating the answers we put them into the sticky.  </s>
<s> here is a link to the &quot;sticky&quot; that r. is referring to.  </s>
<s> see post 19 on page 2 (18 is still not working)... also, here is another thread on the same subject (i'll add a link to this thread as a cross-ref)...  </s>
