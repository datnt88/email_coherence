i noticed that when i played music on my computer, the sound would slow down and then speed back up to the proper speed. then it would do it again and again until it would almost be locked into the slow speed. i checked to make sure everything was working properly (speakers, all sound applications such as itunes, media player, system sounds) and then went to work on the sound card drivers. i have a soundblaster card. i contacted creative and they told me to &quot;clean sweep&quot; my soundblaster live. i followed the instructions that they gave me. everytime i reinstalled everything, the problem persisted. my lastest attempt has rendered the speakers completely inactive. the only sounds that i have are the computer's beeps. device manager says that the soundcard in there and working properly. but, i cannot play any sounds and the rest of the computer shows that a sound card has not been installed. help! i am pulling my hair out. thanks
goto the device mgr. and check for red/yellow flags are present for sound. if none, then i suggest further to &quot;de-install&quot; the card, power-off, and remove the card. power-on and then allow system to finish booting and once done, shutdown. re-insatll the card(try another slot) and check connections, etc. and power-on once done. it should see new h/w and allow it to install itself or direct it to the drivers source(make dir/source of latest drivers). it should work or attempt at a better rate. if it doesn't work, either you have a stuffed h/w system or a s/w conflict. also, too many resources being used by the system, clean/reduce them or try that before any de-install steps above. you may want to check the system services and determine what you really need. check at  for hints/tips on services. hope this helps... good luck -----willy
