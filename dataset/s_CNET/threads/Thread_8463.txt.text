hi, - my wireless connection on my laptop gets lost whenever i receive phone call. do you know the reason? - also how do you use &quot;pc card&quot; on a desktop computer? is it just for laptops? i'm planning to add a wirelles adapter to my desktop pc, specifically &quot;microsoft mn-730&quot;. which one do you recommend usb adapter or pci adapter?
i'll bet you $500 that you have a 2.4ghz cordless phone! move the base and/or handset as far from the router and pc cards as practical, or get a 900mhz, or 5.8ghz model instead. the wi-fi operates at 2.4ghz.
i agree captaincraig, as a 2.4 ghz very definitely interfere with a 802.11b (most common) wireless network, as they both work in the same frequency range. as for the pc card, it can be used on a desktop, but it requires a special pci card be installed inside the desktop. as for the microsoft adapters, either should work equally well. the usb adapter is easier as it's external.
wi-fi networks work on 2.4 ghz range so if you have a 2.4 ghz phone you will lose the connection because the network and phone will conflict with one another. as for the other things i don't know enough to give you sound advice.
