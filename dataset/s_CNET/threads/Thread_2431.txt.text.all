<s> i have a 20.1&quot; dell monitor that i use with my notebook in my office when i'm not traveling.  </s>
<s> my setup used to be that the monitor on my notebook had a different resolution (1024 x 768) than the external dell monitor (1680 x 1050).  </s>
<s> something happened and now i don't have that 1680 x 1050 resolution as an option, and the external monitor and laptop monitor are now set the same.  </s>
<s> i redownloaded the drivers from the dell cd that came with the monitor, but i still can't set the resolution correctly.  </s>
<s> help!  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i use dual monitors as well, but as a clone.  </s>
<s> how does yours work?  </s>
<s> right click the desktop and click properties.  </s>
<s> go over to the settings tab, and click your monitor, the 20 inch.  </s>
<s> try changing then.  </s>
<s> i know you somehow turn off the laptops monitor, i have a dell laptop and you press ctrl alt f3 to switch the onboard monitor on and off.  </s>

<s> thanks for your post.  </s>
<s> when i go to the settings tab, the dell isn't even an option.  </s>
<s> when i go into advanced, it is there but it doesn't seem to register anywhere else?  </s>
