(i am trying to find some cheaper for my own, see below, project). my reply is predicated upon xp and your purchased programs and data. if the programs can be re-installed into a win7 machine (you'll need to research it), then go with a new win7 machine, and transfer the data. bob's correct. it's limited. time to migrate. but, after the migation, re-format and install xp with sp3. think of recycling to a senior citizen, or a retirement home. i say that because of what i do locally with other seniors in my community.
