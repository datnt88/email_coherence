i need to find a belair20e user guide. also belair100c.
if ericson has no such manual on hand and won't answer your questions it's best to move forward with your plans to replace the gear. yes i see some items with a google search but if you post in a forum it means that that was not what you are looking for. it would be a shame to search for an user manual if the question was generic such as &quot;can i add or replace the antenna?&quot; bob
but will not release to grey market. you have to buy from a distributor or direct to get any user guides.
thanks for clearing that up. so you're encountering folk that feel that manuals should be available and possibly free. these clients have been tough to handle at times but i tend to nod a lot and if they won't pay for the manuals for the task at hand i thank them for their time and consideration and hope they call again. i didn't offer any manual since you could find them with google if they are out there. but makers do own them so they can control how they are disseminated. are you seeing folk that think that such is tantamount to highway robbery? bob
