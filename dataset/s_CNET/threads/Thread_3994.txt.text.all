<s> do you know if a pc chips motherboard will work in a emachine with a new maxtor hard drive?  </s>
<s> and with the emachines o.s. and drivers?  </s>
<s> 1. windows xp activation kicks in and since the os is not on a emachines board, fails.  </s>
<s> no big surprise here. the license was for the emachine and it's not an emachine any more.  </s>
<s> 2. the repairs for xp i noted are for most oem (not brand names) and retail versions of xp. in the future be sure to reveal the details so we can make faster progress.  </s>
<s> i think finding a new emachine board could be the cheap fix here.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks for the help.  </s>
