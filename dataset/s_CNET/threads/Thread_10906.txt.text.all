<s> i am currently looking for a new desktop and don't really know which one to get.  </s>
<s> i am currently looking at the new sony vaio, the dell 8400, and the power mac.  </s>
<s> if you have another suggestion than those listed please feel free to let me know.  </s>
<s> i will primarily use the computer for gaming, downloading music, burning cds, and surfing the web.  </s>
<s> money is not really an object, so which desktop do you think is the best out there?  </s>
<s> any help is much appreciated.  </s>
<s> sony = last in service.  </s>
<s> dell = pc with so-so service, but can be good value and good hardware support.  </s>
<s> apple = top support, but you gotta love it.  </s>

<s> dell uses generic parts.  </s>
<s> most brand names do.  </s>
<s> dell is harder to upgrade.  </s>
<s> on the most part you need to use there exspensive products to upgrade with.  </s>
<s> if money is no object, find a site like, tigerdirect.com,  </s>
<s> there are other sites but what i'm saying is have a desktop custom built with the products you want or, better yet learn to build your own.  </s>
<s> you will have a better quality computer for about the same $ and a lot easier to upgrade.  </s>
<s> skip  </s>
