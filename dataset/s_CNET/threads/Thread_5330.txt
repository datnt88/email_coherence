9046	2	172730	1904606	1904459	ray harinec	4/28/06 10:29 am	1.14622014e12	there are a few different types	of ups's. one is always using the battery to power the output while the battery is constantly being float charged. the other actually transfers from one to the other. if this transfer is the problem, it may be possible to go into the pc's bios and change the power management settings. maybe set it so that the power off button has to be held in for 4 secs before it will turn the system off. one thing about an atx system is that if you shut it off, you must wait a short time [maybe 10 or so seconds] before you can turn it on. has to do with the discharge of capacitors in the power control circuits. possibly the ups causes it to momentarily shut off and then the voltage comes back before the turn on logic will work properly. of course, this still means a reboot which is not at all what the purpose the ups is supposed to do.

(my apartment has no grounding, as most electrical outlets in bangkok are fed by only two wires). i appreciate any help i can get kind regards..... your thanh

9046	8	172730	1912053	1911116	chuckieu	5/2/06 1:26 pm	1.14657636e12	sgt is right	i forgot that part. never saw a ups with all plugs being battery-protected. i'll take your word since you are looking at it. that being said, sgt brought up an important issue. did you run the set-up program that came with ups? unless you did, the computer is not tied to the ups and will act as it has. good luck. chuck
9046	9	172730	1913381	1912053	thanh-bkk	5/3/06 6:24 am	1.14663744e12	power options? setup program???	hello again thank you for replying and trying to help me. i have only once, ever, seen a ups here which had a serial sort of port to be hooked up with a computer, and that ups did cost more than my computer. the only connectors that mine (both!) have are four electricity outlets, of which two are three-prong and two are two-prong, all four are backed up by the battery and have a surge protection. further there are phone - line in and line out, which provides a surge protection as well. and that's it. no other means of connecting it to the computer, and no setup program whatsoever. when i go to the power options as suggested, it will ask for the serial port in use - narda, don't have that. this ups is supposed to simply switch to battery power in the moment the ac goes, and it does that - for every device except the bloody computer. i think i am ready to give up on the whole issue and just thread is at a surge protection - better than nothing since once i had a psu go up in smoke when they operated major welding machines at a neighbouring construction site, which luckily has become a finished apartment building meantime. with kind regards...... your thanh

(these rates are not actual, just used as example) i would suspect you will find your problem there.
