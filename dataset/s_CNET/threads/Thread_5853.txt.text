building my new pc, i have most of the parts already picked out, but i need help deciding on which ati video card would best suit me. i have my eye on the aiw 9800 pro and the aiw x600 pro. the 9800 has 128 mb ram and is 8x agp, and the x600 has 256 mb ram and is pci express. how do these two compare in performance? are the new x... line of cards comprable the the previous line? (e.g.: x600 = 9600?)
i do not know much about video cards but i do know that their both different connection..the aiw 9800 pro is agp and the other is pci...i don't know but does your motherboard both have agp and pci connections...but other than that i do not know which one will run better..however...you should read the specs on both video card and see which one has higher performance at certain values.
u know what,i am also in same exact dilema what to choose.i am also seeking help from u.from days i am searching reviews and forums but still no success.so if u find any info do let me know at my email id mrfrantik@softhome.net regarding what to choose aiw 9800 pro and the aiw x600 pro.
x600 has faster core and memory speed. and it's cheaper than 9800 pro. so i would have to go with that. you will probably need new mobo, i doubt yours have a pci express x 16 slot. check out whosave.com, they might have something. under the computer components, they list the video cards.
what are you going to be doing? gaming? video editing? word and internet? agp is about topped out on its tech. if you need the high frame rates and shading for high end games. look to the pci express technology, this path will allow you to upgrade to newer cards as they are developed.
yes, i am looking for it primarly for gaming, and i am building my computer from scratch, so getting a pci-e mobo will be no problem. thanks to all for the advice.
hey, mrfrantik, i just realized that the 9800 does come with ati's acclaimed remote, but the x600 does not. that may account for the price difference.
