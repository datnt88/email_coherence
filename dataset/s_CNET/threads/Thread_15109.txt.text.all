<s> it's a mini/micro tower...that's bad. it has no video slot...that's bad. it has a 270w psu...that's bad. it might have a spare pci slot but: any card to fit that slot might not be much better than your integrated graphics.  </s>
<s> that machine was not designed to game.  </s>
<s> dell mobo's are usually propriety, which means no upgrades p4's aren't good for gaming, minimum athlonx2, and if you have the money c2d or c2q.  </s>
<s> build a new system buy as best of a video card you can, good framerates come from good video cards.  </s>
<s> i recommend you shell out the money for 1 or 2 radeon hd 4870x2's and a xfire motherboard.  </s>
<s> newegg has them for $500 each i think.  </s>
<s> if you have the cash c2q, if you don't have the cash c2d.  </s>
<s> if the graphics card left you broke, athlonx2, or phenomx3.  </s>
<s> ram, 3 gigs with 32bit os or 4 gigs with 64bit os. ddr3 if your using intel. the lowest latency/fastest clock ddr2 if your using amd.  </s>
