friend just bought new acer netbook and was told that signal distance is 8 to 10 meters. he can't get a signal from 20 feet.(1st floor ) r there any netbooks that have a better antenna , or i can see no reason to buy one , if u have to search for a closer hotspot any advice??
type vista broadcast flag on any search engine to see why it matters. also test that netbook somewhere else. just so you know i picked up the usual acer aspire one and it's fine. mine runs xp and all i had to to was turn the wifi on. bob
involved includes the placement of the wireless router. 1) if it's placed very near a wall, signal, even to a room just behind that wall, will be severally affected (as my brother had complained often) 2) the number of walls between the router and the room. the more walls between, the faster it drops signal (more so if the wall has steel bars for structure) 3) height of placement is also important. placing too low on the floor also can affect, likewise placing too high up. 4) power saving set on your wireless adapter and router.
that is 80 meters. ts a msiu100.
apologies if this seems obvious, but first step in trouble-shooting is to make sure it's turned on. in my experience, troubleshooting often stops at this first step.
