so, while removing the hard drive on my brother's asus eee 1005hab. i, on accident, lost the little black clips that holds it in place. does anyone have any tips on how to fix this? my first instinct is vinyl electrical tape, but i'm worried what will happen if it melts, or by some odd turn, an arc or something. the connector is the one that holds they touchpad in place, so it's quite small. any tips?
many of those parts end up there. cheaper than the entire board.
i tend to use &quot;shipping tape&quot; the one with the string in it. besides being strong, you can cut it along its length and use the strip to wrap, place or tape down &quot;something&quot;. it's certainly isn't electrically conductive and sticky and strong and seems to work. of course, you handle it the best you can and don't buy cheap tape, either. on some quick fix repairs, i have used &quot;clear labels&quot; used for mailing or folder labels, clear seem to be easy to work with and strong enough until a permanent fix is done or left alone. tada -----willy
