i have an office with 3 tenants. how can i seperate their networks without havign to buy 3 routers?
you need one of the pro grade network hubs that run a few thousand and then you create vlans. frankly why make their network your problem. i've done this before and supply a complimentary internet access but never solve their network issues. if those companies want their own lans then tell them to make their own. bob
i am inclined to agree. i have an additional 9 offices to manage and i definitely think it will be in my best interest to let them run their own inner-office cabling and wiring. seems like a bit of a headache to tackle this on the tenants behalf. thanks r proffitt
