i have att dsl internet service with a 2wire wireless network router, which works ok, except for sporadic service interruptions. from time to time there are 5-6 laptops and a printer working from it wirelessly and a dish network receiver wired to it. problem is; i have two other dish receivers that need to be connecter by wire in different rooms/floors away from where the current 2wire router is located. is there something i can used to connect these receivers by wire to my existing wireless network from 2wire? thanks for any help!
i assume you just cannot run ethernet cable which is the best and most reliable. there are 2 popular options. the ethernet over powerline and a ethernet to wireless bridge. the wireless bridge method tends to be a little cheaper and simpler to setup. the system that carry the data over your electrical lines once they are setup are much less susceptible to random loss than wireless.
thanks bill - correct, i don't want to run wires all over the house. the ethernet to wireless bridge sound like what i want to do. would the linksys wet610n or similar be the device i would need. also, do you know if they make one of these with multi-port? since i'm hooking up the dish receiver, if there is a multi-port device i could use the same device to hook-up the blu-ray and tv. i didn't think about those yesterday. again, thanks for the help.
i picked up the wgps606 for 25 refurb and liked it so much i now have 2. look at that one too. bob
