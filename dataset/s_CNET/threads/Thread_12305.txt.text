is it possible to use a flash drive instead of a hard drive in a desk top computer? what would be the advantages/disadvantages?
some of the smaller sized version of linux (puppy, dsl) can be installed on a flash drive. i haven't heard anyone installing a version of windows onto a flash drive, but i would guess it's possible. i'm sure people out there with far more knowledge than me would know of more advantages/disadvantages then i have listed below. disadvantages: booting onto a flash drive is that it is much slower compared to a regular hard drive. not all motherboards are capable of booting to a flash drive. you would have check your bios to find out. you are limited in your hard drive size. advantages: you literally have everything in your pocket. here is something from tom's hardware that talks about install windows xp to a flash drive.
if you have a need for &quot;flash media&quot; then use a ssd drive. which is in effect a large flash drive. if you don't then be practical use a typical hd. why the question, because the answer relies on that. tada -----willy
microsoft or apple would try to prevent it at all cost, hehe.
