i currently have a linksys b router. i have a linksys wireless g laptop card. my speed, range and connectivity are very low (12%). i was wondering if upgrading my router would help with this issue? which should i upgrade to - wireless g or the newer wireless n? should i stay with linksys since that is what the laptop card is? i noticed that linksys has wrt54gt, wrt54g and wrt54gs. is one better than the other? thanks so much. it is really hard to get this info.
an upgrade to a g router is the least costly option. matching your present network card will give you the most bang for the buck. an n router will also require an n adapter to see any speed increase.
i replaced my chip set ethernet adapter with a wired ethernet card and the speed increase was very good, exceeding a second giga bit of ram that was installed. you might consider this rather then the router replacement. the card was a 10/100/1000 with a gb of memory.
