i have a dell demension 3000 and i am trying to hook up a dell a920 printer to it and it will not work. i have a drivers disk and i tried the downloaded version but that did not work either. it installs the drivers but then a screen comes up with installin initial setup but then never finishes it.
you haven't given much information to go on, to try and assess your situation &quot; note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended. &quot;
i have a windows xp with 150 gb of hard disk space and 1 gb of ram. the printer worked fine on a dell demension 2400 that was 6 yrs old. the demension 3000 is five years old. the message reads that it is setting up for intial settup but it never finishes the setup. any other information needed to give advice?
are you using the setup disc that came with the printer, or are you using updated drivers from the manufacturer?
i have tried both neither work. the only one on the website did not list the demension 3000 as a compatable machine when i clicked on the compatbility tab. how can that be if it is a dell product that is only one year apart in terms of how old it is.
the exact wording is: preparing dell all in one center for first use. searching for scanning applications. please wait. i then wait and wait...and nothing happens. i have to then reboot to get rid of the notice.
it might be worth your while to post in the dell forums (here or on the dell support site); because to honest, i'm stumped. only other option might be to 'google' your printer model # for drivers, and see what comes up. sorry b.
i tried going on the dell website and they were giving me trouble with the logon process. i just do not have any luck.
