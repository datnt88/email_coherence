hi guys, let's suppose i'm connected to a network whose admin asked in a friendly way not to download anything but certain things he specified. he never came to my machine or setup any kind of client to it. the question now is, is there any chance he knows what i download??? does he know the name and the extension of the file i download if i use utorrent and magnet links??? thanks for your help in advance
sorry, but we don't help with circumventing employers (or whatever network we talk about) restrictions. and we certainly don't advise installing and using p2p programs at company laptops. at work, the admin runs a remote program once in a while to see what's installed. although i don't know what program he uses i suppose it can see all files on my disk. so the most safe option for you is to only do what is allowed and nothing else. kees
on a company network a good admin installs monitoring apps. in rare cases they'll watch an employee that has installed torrents for simple reasons. do we need to repeat them? bob
