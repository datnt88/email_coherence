<s> i have never heard of using a vacuum cleaner to blow the dust away would be harmful.  </s>
<s> also i have never seen a case where glue are use for the side panel (some detail is missing here), i probably would go with epoxy.  </s>
<s> as for usb 3.0, see what connection is available on the computer then get a usb3 adapter for it.  </s>
<s> i would think pcie 4 or 16 or sata connection should do it.  </s>

<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use canned air or a some compressor if you like, just don't get wild in its use.  </s>
<s> don't &quot;weeeee&quot; the fans or blow-off the jumpers.  </s>
<s> i suspect you use the vacuum cleaner in &quot;blower&quot; mode should be an issue.  </s>
<s> 2. one of the side panels are falling off due to the glue failure, what glue can i use to get it back on, and that will last, the panel is pretty heave since its aluminium.  </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any decent glue or some expoxy should do, follow it instructions.  </s>
<s> there nothing to stop you from &quot;jerry-rigging&quot; a solution.  </s>
<s> 3. how can i upgrade to 3.0 usb from 2.0 usb.  </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you have an empty slot install a usb 3.0 card of good quality, don't be cheap, as they have issues you'll soon find out otherwsie.  </s>
