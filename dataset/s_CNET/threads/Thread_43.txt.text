just built a brand new computer. everything runs fine untill i try to install any video card drivers. installing these leads immediately to a machine check exception. any ideas? xp home intell e6600 asus p5n32-sli deluxe 1 gig ddr2800 saphire ati radeon x850xt 600watt hipro power supply thanks a lot guys! -marc
out of date bios, flash or bum part. check with it's builder to exchange parts till it works. bob ps. what's in your post does not tell us what's bad.
sorry i dont know what else to say. i built it all myself today. it's my first attempt at building a pc..untill now i've just swaped parts and such. the only clue i have for you guys is that without installing video card drivers everything is just fine.
i wonder if you forgot some bios or flash update, the motherboard drivers (some try what's on the cd and that's buggy or out of date.) with such slim details all i can say is to call the maker and ask what they want to be exchanged. another nutty thing is overclocking. imagine the poor soul that tries that. bob
i just got xp home edition updated with service pack2 the video card drivers (latest omega)randomly worked last night however when i restarted i got the same error i have never overclocked. bios is stock, as it came on the mobo, i checked asus website for an update however the only bios on their site for labeled as &quot;initial release&quot; so im assuming im on that now. here are the numbers in the error 0x0000009c (0x00000000, 0xf7ac3050, 0xp02000040, 0x00000800)
i've dropped this hint twice so here's the last time. tell me about the os install. specifically what motherboard drivers you installed. if none, then tell that. bob
this is a low-level hardware issue cause by: memory errors that may include parity or error correction code (ecc) problems cache errors in the processor or hardware translation lookaside buffers (tlb) errors in the processor other cpu-vendor specific detected hardware problems vendor-specific detected hardware problems first, you'll need bios v 0310 (a beta bios) to support your cpu and ram.  the &quot;stock&quot; bios is not fully compatible with either. from asus' spec sheet: cpu: socket775 for intel pentium processor extreme edition / pentium d / pentium 4 / celeron cpu memory: dual channel memory architecture 4 x 240-pin dimm sockets support max. 16gb ddr2 667/533 non-ecc memory you could try manually setting your ram to ddr2-667 since ddr2-800 can be problematic even on boards with explicit support. lastly, the p5n32 has been known to be troublesome with dual core intel cpus since its release. imho, you be best off exchanging the board for one based on the intel 946, 965 or 975 chipset.
the problem seems to have been solved by some random reinstalling....thanks for your help...it's gone through 2 restarts now and no bluescreens
