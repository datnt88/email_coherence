my favorite is belkin routers.
i feel confused with huawei e392, what is different between huawei e392-1and huawei e392-11 . and i do not know which one i should choice .who can tell me . i will very thankful.
if the maker and seller will not discuss pre-sales questions then it's a sign of how well they will support you later. no sale. bob
