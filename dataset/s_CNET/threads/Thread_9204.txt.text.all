<s> i am shopping for a socket am2 mb and i wanted one with an agp slot since i have a few agp cards lying around.  </s>
<s> my case is atx.  </s>
<s> i seem to only be finding mb's that meet my criteria in micro atx.  </s>
<s> anyone know of a mb full size atx, socket am2, with agp slot?  </s>
<s> maybe there is no such animal and i will have to go pci-e and sell agp cards on ebay?  </s>
<s> the agp bridge reduces the agp video speed to 1x or less.  </s>
<s> many discover this after the fact.  </s>

<s> here are the choices from newegg... slim pickings.  </s>
<s> i don't recommend paying for obsolete technology (agp) if you have a choice.  </s>
<s> even if your old agp card is a quadro, you should really consider getting a pci-express based motherboad.  </s>
<s> agp cards are typically more expensive than their pci-e counterparts and there are fewer choices (and those choices are only going to shrink).  </s>
<s> if the card is more than 3 years old, you can probably get a faster pci-express card for less than $150.  </s>
