<s> hi forum; i have a proposed system build from the following parts: ocz stealthxstream 700w gigabyte ga-ma785gmt-ud2h amd phenom ii 955 2x 1gbddr3 pc3-10600 1333mhz wd caviar blue 500gb sataii xfx radeon hd 4890 1gb lg w2230s-efv case is already there, a generic atx box. the budget is somewhat limited to 550 gbp, so i would welcome any comments on improvements to this... please, no fanboy rants, though.  </s>
<s> tia andy  </s>
<s> why only 2gb of ram?  </s>
<s> i would bump that to 4gb.  </s>
<s> i think you will have a more enjoyable experience with your build.  </s>
<s> sounds like a good system enough.  </s>
<s> i'd check around deeper for the best pricing.  </s>
<s> i didn't see a chip fan on there, are you going to use the stock one in the retail box?  </s>
<s> many times you can get a &quot;white box&quot; chip & pick up a 'radical' fan, for less than a &quot;retail box&quot; chip.  </s>
<s> make sure you have a side fan or a front fan to help cool that chip off.  </s>
<s> it gets going even with out tweaking.  </s>
<s> also make sure your fans flow in one direction (as i've said in other posts).  </s>
<s> my system runs an average of 40 c in the summer.  </s>
<s> that's the board (similar) that i use in one of my systems, & it's good.  </s>
<s> you can really tweak it.  </s>
<s> are you going to stick with the on board sound?  </s>
<s> it's not bad, so you can cut that expense away.  </s>
<s> i'd look for more ram & juggle a few things to make sure i had it.  </s>
<s> i'm running 2 two gig sticks (on xp) & can use more for other things.  </s>
<s> your on board pcie video is going to clip a chunk of your ram.  </s>
<s> out of the box, i believe it's 256megs.  </s>
<s> that is, i'm taking it that you're going to use both the add-on card & the on board one.  </s>
<s> depends on your os version too.  </s>
<s> additional thought would be ram coolers, but your system looks like it's ready for action.  </s>
<s> i always use this rule; chip, fan, ram.  </s>
<s> then; board, video, power, sound.  </s>
<s> everything else you can cut corners on & not be greatly concerned.  </s>
<s> anyhow good luck on your build.  </s>
<s> well, thanks for your answers, appreciated.  </s>
<s> i will cool the thing with an additional 150mm fan blowing filtered air through the side panel at the cpu fan intake and some should go (the extra being bigger) over the ram, too.  </s>
<s> so i thought i could get away with the stock cooler... can't find a tray cpu here at the moment, but if any uk readers have a source, i'll be grateful for that! the ram is that low because, frankly, i'm running a bit low on money; it's going to get some more in a few months. the system is planned to run a dual boot of xp sp3 (is there an issue with 6 gb ram other than it being not used?) and 64 bit ubuntu lucid.  </s>
<s> i heard something about the ati drivers on lucid not being all that good, is that true?  </s>
<s> because i would be tempted to reconsider and go for a nvidia gpu, although for the price i wouldn't get a comparable one over here.  </s>
<s> greetz andy  </s>
<s> you're welcome.  </s>
<s> i have heard that the stock fan will work fine, even with mild tweaks to the chip.  </s>
<s> i don't use it & use a cooler master.  </s>
<s> i also didn't like that the heat transfer plate of my amd fan, was so small. the fan i did use, had a better coverage.  </s>
<s> just a note there.  </s>
<s> good choice to use a side fan & filter, blowing into the case.  </s>
<s> to many people have side fans pull out.  </s>
<s> which if strong enough, will reduce the flow to the chip.  </s>
<s> i have heard there are problems with ram over 4 gigs for xp, but don't have the actual use errors myself.  </s>
<s> i don't have any issues with the 4 gigs i use, but that may be because that the video borrows some.  </s>
<s> in reality, every program that loads, &quot;thinks&quot; it needs to have a chunk when you boot.  </s>
<s> so keeping the registry & drives clean & aligned, should alleviate any issues.  </s>
<s> i'd (google) search any compatibility issues, before making a purchase, see what comes up.  </s>
<s> find out if the issues (if any), are worth the fix for the gains.  </s>
<s> often they are.  </s>
<s> two gigs of ram, with a 1 gig video is a good ratio for many applications.  </s>
<s> i've run many high end games & video programs with a self build, with a ratio like that.  </s>
<s> you can always add more later :}).  </s>
<s> good luck on your build  </s>
