have you checked the cable connected from your pc to internet modem? if it is working properly than try to connect additional lan card to your pc.
in most cases, your internet provider will come out help you for free if you have problems connecting to the internet. i had them come out one day and they found loose connection on the outside of my house.
i live wid my flatmates,the problem is only in mine pc ,rest r wrking f9.so wt shld i do nw....plz suggest ny idea.thnks 4 replying to my question
could be hardware (as you suggest), a driver, malware or a corrupted os. to solve it, i would start with a clean install of windows (back to factory conditions, be sure you have a backup of everything you don't want to lose). if the problem persists, it's a hardware issue. otherwise it's solved. kees
i think first you need to check internet cable connected to your pc to modem. if its working properly so maybe it is problem with your operating system. some file might be corrupt. i was facing the same problem last month then i got windows reinstalled into my pc and never see the problem again.
