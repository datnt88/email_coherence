<s> i have a dlink 514 (i know it is old) connected between my dsl modem and my pc so i can use the wifi in the 514. is it possible to disconnect from my pc and to connect to the wifi with the 514 having no wired pc attached?  </s>
<s> if needed, i'll upgrade router if later version will do what i'm asking.  </s>
<s> thanks, ron c  </s>
<s> yes. you need to purchase a wireless adapter, preferably a pci type for the pc. you'll need to set up the wireless while wired, then unplug the wired lan connector and go wireless.  </s>
