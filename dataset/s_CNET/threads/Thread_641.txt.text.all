<s> i have acer aspire 3000 and zv6000.  </s>
<s> someone gave me a ram but i don't know whether they are competable with these two computer.  </s>
<s> i am going to have two ram, is it ok if one is ddr266 and the other one is ddr333?  </s>
<s> do they have to be the same?  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> mode, they must be virtually twins.  </s>
<s> in single channel mode, you can use them mixed except that the memory bus can only run at the speed of the slower [ddr 266].  </s>
<s> thus the ddr 333 will perform exactly as ddr 266.  </s>
<s> go to: they have a program which will scan your pc and tell you exactly which ram to use.  </s>
