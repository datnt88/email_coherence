i have a pretty good computer right now but i feel that there are some problem spots that need to be looked at. specs: ati 4870hd intel e6750 2.66ghz 4mb cashe g.skill 8g's ram western digital hd's asus p5k-se 600w powersupply i have about 250 dollars to spend right now and i was really looking to upgrade my e6750 because it might be bottlenecking my graphics card. what im having problems with is what to do with that money. from what i know most games dont have quad-core support but with technology idk how long that will last. so my question is what should i do with that money?? stick with a good dual core like a e8500 or go to a quad core. (im going to have to stick to my lga 775 socket)
one). that way you would have a high performance peripheral to carry forward to a new system when the time arises...there's not much gain or future in getting another socket 775. vapcmd
if that was the case what should i get for a graphics card then. i was leaning towards nvidea because of the performance in games and ive had problems with my ati.
have you been able to overcome the problems ? vapcmd
ati just has never been good for me in general its more of a preference to use nvidea. ive had many nvidea card and they all functioned perfectly for me. the 4870 was my first ati and its just missing something that i like from nvidea. ive been looking at the gtx 200 series but i really dont know what the prices will look like in a few months with the 300 series coming out
or the ones from amd/ati ? another thought . . . skip the l775 cpu and use the $$ for a socket 1366 or 1156 mb which gives you a platform for more cpu power and the option to use crossfire or sli plus usb 3.0 and sata 3. vapcmd
