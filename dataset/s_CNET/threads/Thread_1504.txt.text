hey this has had me thinking for quite a while now so was wondering what other people think. i have left all power saving options for my hard disk off, e.g. &quot;turn off hard disks after 2 hours&quot; etc. the theory behind this was that it causes more wear and tear on the hd if it powers off and starts again then when it idles, however i'm just not sure of this. now my pc is on 24/7 and most of the time it has ftp running and downloads going on, so hd activity is mostly active anyway, but my second hd is sometimes idle. what does everyone else think? thanks!
this depends on the hard disk make and model and there will be no firm answer. your typical maxtor, wd, seagate and others will have what they call a 5-year service life and rated for so many actuations of the mechanical parts. the only people i see lose hard disks are ... 1. my neighbor whose screensaver is one labeled &quot;disk defragmenting...&quot; 2. my other neighbor. house hit by lightning. now believes in circuit protectors. 3. joe gamer. built a fast box, but let it cook since he didn't like all that fan noise. 4. grace. she dropped the hard disk. i have machines that have over 10 years 24x7 of hard disk spinning without a failure. what's in common is that they reside in broom closets that people can fiddle with the boxes. maybe this helps, maybe not. there is no correct answer. bob
