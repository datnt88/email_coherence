gah! my wifi performance was awesome... then it wasn't. i'm getting what seems like huge amounts of rx retries (like 60% of rx packet count). other devices on same router are fine so the problem's in the local pc. any ideas? how do i begin to debug?
i can only guess you tried system restore.
yah, i hear ya... hp 6680t win7 home premium sp 1 dev mgr image: here typical errors: here what else can i offer?
the errors look to be on the receive and since wifi can be subject to issue such as interference and i won't hold a class here but will mention that a reflected signal can make a specific location unusable and the fix for that is well discussed why not try it at a location half the distance to the wifi hotspot? bob
