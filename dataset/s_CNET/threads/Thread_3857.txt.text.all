<s> i'm having some problems with my computer and was wondering if any of you out there may know what is causing my problem so i know whether or not to bother fixing it.  </s>
<s> so basically my computer crashes while i am playing world of warcraft.  </s>
<s> the screen freezes up on and the last second of sound at the time of the freeze repeats over and over like a machine gun or something.  </s>
<s> i thought perhaps that it was my vide card seeing as how it was a 2 plus year old radeon 9600 pro, but i went out and bought a new geforce 6200 and i am still having the above mentioned problem. the wierd thing is that my computer only seems to freeze while playing warcraft, though i havent tried any other games.  </s>
<s> my system specs are amd athlon xp 2800+ 2.08 ghz 1.50ghz ram geforce 6200 thanks for help in advance and if you have any questions i'll answer them as fast as i can! thanks again!  </s>
<s> is this computer overclocked?? .... download this software and tell me your temprature ( ) i think its because of your high temprature..so this software will give your temprature at idle....and for load download this program ( ) and also run the speedfan because prime95 will give your pc a 100% load.  </s>
<s> and now post your idle as well as your load temp..bye  </s>
<s> i'll be able to play it for maybe 2 hours and then it'll quit (p4 3.6ghz, x1900 ati).  </s>
<s> i had to decrease the resolution.  </s>
<s> and darkstar has an option to turn off shadows, which greatly increased performance.  </s>
<s> in the support forum for the game they told me to put the program darkstar.exe in the the exceptions list turning off dep or wep, or something like that.  </s>
<s> if after decreasing resolution and reinstalling directx still the same thing happens, its probably something you're just going to have to live with with that game.  </s>
<s> darkstar one always quits on me.  </s>
<s> i had an athlon xp 3200+.  </s>
<s> i had the same problem when running even simple games, i ran some tests on it and found that the cpu was getting very hot.  </s>
<s> upon further research i found that this whole line of cpu's runs notoriously hot.  </s>
<s> i'd recommend downloading a program to check your temp.  </s>
<s> if its too hot, try buying some better thermal grease (i use arctic silver.) apply that to your athlon and give it a try.  </s>
<s> i had to do it a couple times to get the right amount, too much = too hot, too little = too hot. that should fix the problem, your comp is doing exactly what mine did.  </s>
<s> so i installed the two programs you mentioned and at idle my temp seems to be around 20 c and when i turn on prime 95 my temperture quickly climbs to over 50 c and a little fire icon appears...i assume this is a bad thing.  </s>
<s> so i figure i will try what was suggested by kestrel731 and go and buy some thermal grease to see if it helps any.  </s>
<s> please feel free to post any other suggestions or tips, and thank you very much so far.  </s>
<s> i'll update my status when i try the thermal grease.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> tried using some arctic silver and it seems to be working good.  </s>
<s> temp is staying fairly low, so far so good!  </s>
<s> thanks everyone for the help!  </s>
