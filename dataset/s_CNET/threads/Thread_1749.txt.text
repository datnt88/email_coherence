i am building my first computer and am taking the hd from my old computer to save money. what do i need to do to my hd before i take it out and put it in the new computer i am building?
it won't work. xp is locked to that hd and that motherboard and peripherals. it'll fail, and there's no workaround.
the only problem may arise is windows. as far as i remmember u can't install xp on 2 different mobo using 1 licences. so, u'd better contact mocrosoft support team. anyway, i'm sure it's possible.
