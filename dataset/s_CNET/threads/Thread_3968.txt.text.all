<s> i work for a 6 room bed & breakfast that is also a bakery/cafe. the owner wants all of the hotel rooms and the entire cafe area to be wifi enabled, and i'm the one tasked to make it happen.  </s>
<s> a coworker of mine tried to set up a system while i was out of town for the holidays, and failed miserably.  </s>
<s> using the hardware he bought, i've created a decent solution, but i want a better one.  </s>
<s> right now, i'm using a netgear mr814v2 as the router and wireless access point, with a netgear wg602v3 configured to be a repeater.  </s>
<s> with this system, range and connectability are okay, but the whole thing crashes about once a day and has to be power cycled.  </s>
<s> totally unacceptable to me.  </s>
<s> i'm imagining that this is happening because the router is cheapo and can't handle more than a few wireless connections at once.  </s>
<s> so i'm asking anyone out there with hotspot set-up experience: do you have any suggestions for what i should buy?  </s>
<s> i want a rock solid router that can handle at least 15 wireless connections at once without crapping out.  </s>
<s> it work with around 20 wireless and 12 wired pc. but the network is in one two floor building, and mostly using a divider only (only 4 close room) for your needs, you mightbe interested to look here:  </s>
<s> lots of good info and can buy want may work for you?  </s>
<s> les  </s>
<s> sorry i'm late to the game.  </s>
<s> you might look into lessnetworks.com  </s>
<s> they offer a hotspot software that works very well.  </s>
<s> if you can set it up yourself(i did), the software is free.  </s>
<s> you only need a minimul computer and a wireless router.  </s>
<s> good luck  </s>
