with everything removed except working memory (various sizes and combinations tried in a similar machine), internal video, mouse and kb i am getting a blinking #1 light (no memory detected) and solid 3 & 4 lights (memory detected but a fault was encountered). 
anyone seen this or have a clue on what to do next? 
im not sure what your problem is but, ram problem, board problem? 
if you have another dell 5150 working, test ram there, if ok, then swap into problem system. 
install the ram just the same way you had in the test system. 
if the problem persists then you got a bad mtrbd. 
or possibility bad psu. the odd chance you have a bad ram slot is also possible, maybe broken or bent seats, inspect well. 
the blinking leds are suppose to a clue to the error/problem, what does dell supply?
