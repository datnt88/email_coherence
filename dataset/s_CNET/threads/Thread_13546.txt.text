so i still havent bought my cpu, mobo or video card. the more i keep reading the more ppl keep bringing up the 64bits that are scheduled to come out. anyone know the price range that these babies will be in when they come out? i ask because if its something that will be in the $200-300 range for a cpu -then i will wait and get that but if they are going to be $500+ chips then id rather just spend the $200 and get my 3.0p4 now and think about going 64bit next year or later.
64bit were out long time and they arent that expensive. in fact they are cheaper than some p4s. amd athlon 64 3000+ cost 153 bucks amd athlon 64 3200+ cost 190 bucks. i think what ppl are talking about is dual cores not 64-bit.
amd has had the athlon 64 for an awful long time. intel came out with 64-bit (em64t) in their 6xx series around february and newegg along with other retailers have been selling them ever since: click here:
then im just in 'moron' phase and u can disregard is it worth going to 64bit ?
your answer might be answered as time passes. by december the 64-bit hammer may be in full swing as retailer shovel off the &quot;old&quot; 32-bit only offerings. -&gt; ask yourself if you are happy to run what there is today and not what may be in 64-bit next year. bob
64 bit amd, for the socket 939. do not get a socket 754 type, they are old news.
yes, since you are building new, the 64-bit is the wave of the future. nerdyboy mentioned dual core which also has the 64-bit support and is even newer. dual core provides two execution cores in one physical processor allowing the platform to do more in less time, performing multiple tasks with smooth interaction with your pc. intel currently has dual core: pent d processor 820, 2.8ghz = $241 pent d processor 830, 3.0ghz = $316 pent d processor 840, 3.2ghz = $530 in 1000 unit quantities the dual core intel pentium processor extreme edition 3.2ghz, with motherboard, intel d955x bklkr, and 955x pci-express chipset with ddr2 is supposed to be $1050. the amd 64 dual core processing family should be out by the end of september and is supposed to include models: 4800 processor = $1000 4600 processor = $803 4400 processor = $581 4200 processor = $537 respectively, in 1000 unit quantities
thanks for all the info guys glad i asked you guys first
