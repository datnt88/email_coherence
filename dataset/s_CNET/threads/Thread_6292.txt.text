they are supposed to be available the same time... why isnt the much better cp710 not yet available?
that all selphys had the same release dates. from what i read, the selphy 510 and 810 were due out in september, and they were. the 710 was not due until october, so there is still more than three weeks for canon to meet their schedule. if the 710 is not out by the end of the month, you may question the reason for the delay. however, we would have no way of knowing why canon failed -- you should direct such questions directly to them. frank
or thought wrong... i read cp510 is out september so i thought they would be released same time...
