not sure what happened as its not my powerbook i think it may have been dropped a few times but the os is fine. anyway from the front to where they keyboard starts (including the touch pad) has kind of bent upward. i can see all the orange wires and they look all connected (mite not be) but when the laptop is on they keyboard will no longer work, (having to use a usb keyboard any ideas what it could be? loose connection? hardware fault or software fault, but all other hardware and osx are fine. thanks mf
just a few other things i should mention osx tiger 15&quot; 80gb thanks mf
while it likely can be fixed since there are all of two parts involved (keyboard and mainboard) the weird thing is that since it's not yours why would you fix it? just wondering. bob
just helping out a friend who isnt to good when it comes to computers. also wondering if there is anything i should know or do before taking the casing off. mf
i don't like fixing my friend's computers that have suffered such damage since the unit could decide to turn into a brick just by removing the case. it's suffered some hard times but still works. until you are sure they are ok with getting a brick back i'd leave it alone. plus if you do, why open it unless you have the spare parts to put in? bob
really just to check if anything was loose, but if its risky,i'l leave it, unless he decides he is going to buy a new one. he is holding the front together with tape at the moment, any ideas how to bend the front panel back into place? when i had a look there were lots of small round marks round the edge but could not see any screws missing. thanks mf
there is no magic there but i use a body shop down the road and they do amazing work. i'm not so good at that. -&gt; for me i would be hitting ebay to see if i could scrounge up a not so bent up case. bob
i will have to get him on ebay befor he gets the old hammer out, thanks for all your help. mf
