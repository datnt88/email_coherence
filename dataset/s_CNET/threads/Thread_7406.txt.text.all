<s> ok i know that i need a sdram 512mb pc133.  </s>
<s> my question is does it make a difference if its generic or from my pc's manufacturer?  </s>
<s> i found a generic for $50 and the one for my pc for $200.  </s>
<s> i'm probably not going to get the generic one but i just want to know if it makes a difference.  </s>
<s> i also want to know if ram from my pc's manufacturer or this other memory for $140? the $140 one is also a 512mb and i just want to know what does the cl1 cl2 cl3 means.  </s>
<s> so out of the three which ram should i buy?  </s>
<s> generic $50 pc's manufacturer $200 or sdram 512mb cl1 or cl2 or cl3 $140?  </s>
<s> your manual/docs will explain &quot;exactly&quot; what you need.  </s>
<s> if not, then visit your support website to finbd out via the specs page what that ranm requirement is.  </s>
<s> you gave no mention of the system but quoted this and that of the ram needed, but since no refernce to system, only guess will be a response.  </s>
<s> offhand, manufactors of systems will always be more expensive but you get extactly what you need.  </s>
<s> check with or for possible ram prices for your system.  </s>
<s> generic, is always cheaper but there's the offchance it may fail as they're not as tolerant of extremes of system demands and basically are at times, 2nd rate ram, so check carefully for any return policy.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> and then what os using?  </s>
<s> w98 will only handle 512mb max no matter what mohterboard manual states.  </s>
<s> referring to the crucial site - by far the best advice.  </s>
<s> in terms of help and guidance it is the best and easiest i have seen.  </s>
<s> and they have an interactive live help as well.  </s>
<s> it explains everything from ram to clx to ecc, you name it.  </s>
<s> in search mode you just type in the exact model of your pc and it pinpoints the right ram, albeit their product, but do you blame them.  </s>
<s> in any case their memory is well known and trusted widely.  </s>
<s> i agree with these guys.  </s>
<s> go to to fin out what memeory is needed for your motherboard.  </s>
<s> they have some of the best quality memory available today.  </s>
<s> i do not recommend &quot;generic&quot; memory, as thy are usually poorly built and you will waste money.  </s>
<s> go with crucial/micron to be sure.  </s>
