since honeycomb is tailored for tegra 2 tablets, is it necessary to upgrade motorola xoom or asus eee pad transformer tf101 to a newer android os?
the tablet maker would issue it. this is not like &quot;windows.&quot; hope the short answer suffices. yes there are other folk hacking it onto some tablets but then no support that i can find. bob
my concerns is &quot;icecream and jellybean are mostly for omap, upgrade these tegra 2 tablets to android 4.xx probably, if not definitely, not a good option.&quot; i wonder if asus and motorola would issue an effective upgrade versions since the tegra 2 tablets are being faded out.
it's quite a strange statement. remember i've been programming the pre-historic tablets (pre-android) so i find your statement something i would never write. bob
but let's get this up on the table. the tablet makers do not see recurring revenue by issuing updates. in fact i've encountered bugs in systems and years later the bug is still there. let's take the gloves off and not sugar coat this issue. you can not expect the tablet makers to issue updates. apple will be the exception but you see that ipad 1 may have had it's last update. bob
