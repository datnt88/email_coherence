<s> i want to have 8 gigs of ram on vista 64-bit.  </s>
<s> now the mobo's spec does not mention if it supports intel emt64 technology.  </s>
<s> does that mean that i cannot have 8 gigs of ram on this mobo even with vista-64 bit ?  </s>

<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> suggest you also google asus p5n32-e sli nforce 680i and look at some of the reviews.  </s>
<s> i saw 150 for that specific mobo at newegg.  </s>
<s> generally asus has a memory compatibility list grouped by stick size at the downloads area for each mobo.  </s>
<s> if you don't see it listed it could be an issue.  </s>
<s> hey jconner thanks for the info.  </s>
<s> i looked at the newegg reviews and the qualified vendor list.  </s>
<s> now one of the reviewers stated that he was happy about the board supporting 8 gb, but didn't mention clearly if he actually had 8 gb on it.  </s>
<s> now my question becomes: even if the system does not have a problem recognizing 8 gb and shows 8 gb, how would you know if the system is ever using the second 4 gig pair when the first 4 gig pair is used up ?  </s>
<s> in other words, is it even theoretically possible for the system to ever use the 2nd pair of 4 gigs without intel emt support ?  </s>
<s> it says on the intel qx6800 prod.  </s>
<s> brief .pdf  </s>
<s> file that emt requires supporting mobo, bios, and os. any ideas ?  </s>
<s> thanks again  </s>
<s> and also i would e-mail asus support and ask the question of them.  </s>
<s> i'm sorry i don't know the answer to your question.  </s>
<s> intel support and forums may also have an answer.  </s>
<s> i also tend to use google like a person and ask specific questions with sometimes very good results.  </s>
<s> almost always i find it gets me to forum discussions similar to what i'm trying to find out.  </s>
<s> glad the suggestions helped a bit.  </s>
<s> ok i will post the question there.  </s>
<s> thanks a lot jconner.  </s>
