hi i've got the zero configuration set to start automatically (win xp home sp2) but when i restart the pc the service hasn't started and i have to start it manually. how do i overcome this/ thanks
do you have some linksys, belkin, dlink, netgear, card? bob
the wireless adapter on my laptop is a belkin and i've a talktalk router.
the belkin software is at issue here. you can see this discussed on the web but most of us just use belkin's replacement for this. bob
thanks for that. i found another solution on microsoft forum. open notepad and type the following text (in lower case) net start wzcsvc save this as wbt.bat (onto the desktop). then copy this bat file to c:\documents and settings\all users\start menu\programs\startup then restart the computer.
i've found another fix - i went into device manager and uninstalled my card, i then restarted my laptop and sure enough all is well - zero configuration starts every time. a friend suggested this he thought that during the original installation something had gone wrong and zero configuration hadn't been configured correctly. by uninstalling in device manager you just remove the cards driver it seeems. you learn something new every day!
