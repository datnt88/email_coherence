i need help on my first pc build, i need to know a motherboard/mainboard that can support overclocking and all the parts below. gpu-  or a  ram-  chassis-  psu-  cpu-  hdd-  ssd-  any input would be greatly appreciated. also am i missing anything besides the motherboard/mainboard? for example, does the cpu cooler come with the cpu? are all the cables included in the items? are all the parts compatible? since i am completely new to this i don't know what to look for, so your advice could really help me.
a bit backwards. you'd be better off selecting a motherboard and matching components to it. motherboard manufacturers will tell you what cpus are supported and what ram has been tested and shown compatible. i'd get the mb first and not last.
what your looking for is an am3+ type. here's a bunch.  pick one that has the features you want. read the reviews. verify the cpu support list. over clocking.......i don't go there.......can of worms. cpu....the retail/boxed version come with a hsf.
