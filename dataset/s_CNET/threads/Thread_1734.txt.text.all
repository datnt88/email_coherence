<s> i just bought this great tablet a couple weeks ago.  </s>
<s> i was just getting everything set up, apps, games, news, shopping, etc... and while i was playing solitare i picked up the nook in my hand and it was real hot on the back panel,,, seconds later it shut itself off and it aint starting anymore, is it toast ?  </s>
<s> i hope this is covered by warranty,,,,, any opinions ?  </s>
<s> i would go for a full refund and try some other system.  </s>
<s> barnes and noble tried but it's hard to get traction in the market.  </s>
<s> i think there are many other fine choices.  </s>

<s> 24 hours later i had tried charging it and the whole time the nook charge light just glowed green, even thou it should have been orange first, so i tried one last time to restart it,,, pressed the on tab for about 15 seconds instead of usual 4 or 5. it came on,, best i can figure,, i had been activating apps from nook , and i get the feeling they want you to do them one at a time,, they say the tablet will pick up the app in about a half hour,,, i had tried to get about 3 in that time, so im thinking that might have been too much info coming to the tablet , so for now its been working great all day, and i dont have to toss $120, in the trash.  </s>
<s> that's not that bad a deal.  </s>
<s> but if it fails for you and is defective i didn't write to toss it but to go for a refund.  </s>

<s> if id have bought it at walmart, i would have returned it, exchange for another,,, but returning something thru an internet purchase is not my idea of fun, lol so i got lucky, &quot;this time&quot; and theres 1 less &quot;refurb&quot; out there.  </s>
