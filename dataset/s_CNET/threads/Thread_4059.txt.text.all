<s> what do you guys think?  </s>
<s> i can't but a price on it.  </s>
<s> can you guys tell me a reasonable price for it.  </s>
<s> *the reason i'm selling it is because i bough an hp laptop and i have it connected to the expansion bay and well i can use it as a desktop.  </s>
<s> so i prefer to have one computer instead of two computers.  </s>
<s> this acer aspire is pretty close to your config and costs $370 new: since your pc is used, cut that price in half ($185).  </s>
<s> add $40 for the monitor, $25 for printer (see ebay pricing), and $20 for speakers and keyboard/mouse.  </s>
<s> that's what i insured one like that i sent to my nephew.  </s>
<s> since there is no warranty or support the price takes a heavy hit.  </s>
<s> see what they are going for on ebay.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> unless i needed the money.  </s>
<s> i'm curious about this statement tho.  </s>
<s> and i have it connected to the expansion bay and well i can use it as a desktop?  </s>
<s> i have it connected to an hp expansion bay and have my notebook setup as a desktop:p  </s>
<s> ok well from what i think is a reasonable price would be about 300-400$ has good stuff inculded i agree with someother people you should keep it for future stuff...... anyways that is a pretty good machine!  </s>
<s> i was thinking of that price.  </s>
<s> but if i buy the amd athlon 64 x2 cpu i said i want and a compaq 19&quot; widescreen lcd display then i won't sell it.  </s>
<s> lol! but yeah who knows.  </s>
