i want to buy a good sound card for gaming and music. any suggestions? i dont really want to spend more then $50.
some onboard sound cards are upstaged even with a 10 dollar card from compgeeks.com but my 3 favorite cards continue to be... 1. 10 dollar cards. (any non-aureal with xp drivers) 2. turtle beach sound cards. 3. sb audigy (1 or 2...) bob
i own a onboard sound card. it is a sis(7012) soundcard that is all i know
