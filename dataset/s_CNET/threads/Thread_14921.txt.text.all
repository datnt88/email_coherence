<s> my colleague bought a kingston 512mb extended memory to install on his ibook.  </s>
<s> the ibook detected the memory, and updated the total ram as 768mb (512 + 256).  </s>
<s> everything seems alright, but after working for a very short while, the ibook will stop responding.  </s>
<s> he restarts the ibook, and after a while, the machine &quot;hang&quot; again.  </s>
<s> if he removes the 512 memory, the machine will work fine.  </s>
<s> could this be the problem of the ram?  </s>
<s> or what other reasons can there be?  </s>
<s> but you have not mentioned which ibook your colleague has, or what version of the mac os it is running.  </s>
<s> if, on removing the ram, the machine functions normally, i would suspect that the ram was faulty.  </s>
<s> pass on a little more information and we'll go from there.  </s>
<s> btw, most ram from reputable companies is warranted for life.  </s>
<s> p  </s>
<s> ram sticks don't match on speed... or something else...  </s>
<s> ok thank you very much.  </s>
<s> i can't get more information from him as yet because he has travelled overseas.  </s>
<s> but i'll ask him to check the ram speed.  </s>
<s> if not, he will probably exchange the ram.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
