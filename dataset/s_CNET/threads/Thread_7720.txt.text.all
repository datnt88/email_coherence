<s> i went through setup and internet works with any connect computer through direct connection.  </s>
<s> also, my iphone and htc aria both connect to the router wirelessly but i cannot get my laptop or my parents computer to connect wirelessly.  </s>
<s> i have tried allowing them through the router and it does not work. the network is secured with a password and i am correctly typing the password in.  </s>
<s> i do not understand how my phones can connect but not my laptop or computer?  </s>
<s> i have updated the firmware on the router and everything works on it perfectly.  </s>
<s> any help would be nice.  </s>
<s> p.s, this router is hooked up directly to a att uverse modem.  </s>
<s> 3800hgv-v is what i have and i used the wifi in that.  </s>
<s> to connect another router can be troublesome so let's have all the details.  </s>
<s> for example one member had the new router set to channel 13 which is non-us and many devices couldn't see it.  </s>
<s> another member hid the ssid!  </s>

<s> yeah, i use the wifi in the uverse modem as well but i forgot to mention that i will be bringing this to college.  </s>
<s> i will post information as soon as i get back from work.  </s>
<s> the one i use is 3800hgv-b.  </s>
<s> i am sure you need more info than that so just list what you need and i can find them.  </s>
<s> thanks for helping so far though! it is appreciated  </s>
<s> i will be leaving for an extended trip.  </s>
<s> i know this is hard but i have to leave it to members to share the details.  </s>
<s> if i had to interview and list all the required details very few could get fast fixes here.  </s>
<s> since it works with the uverse my diagnosis is the setup is incorrect in the second wifi router.  </s>
<s> we cover how to do that in post 18 or 19 in the cnet networking forum.  </s>
<s> it's not easy but not too hard.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i will look into it, thanks.  </s>
