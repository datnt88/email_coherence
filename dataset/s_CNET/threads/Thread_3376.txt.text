hey guys! dell's situation seems to be going from bad to worse. check this out:  i'd like to hear your thoughts on what dell should do next. -jdm
dell is toast! i mean, if no one cares what happens to the company either way... -jdm
the ihatedell.net site is extremely entertaining....i have been reading it for two hours now!
pretty friggin' incredible, huh? so, steve...what do you think? is dell toast, or can they turn it around? what would you do if you were put in charge of the company today? would you try to straighten things out...or would you bail and take the golden parachute? -jdm
i am so glad i never bought a dell, and that site is pretty funny as well. thanks for the chuckle.
if you were put in charge of dell, bob...what would you do? do you think you could turn things around, or would you be checking out the classified ads? -jdm
