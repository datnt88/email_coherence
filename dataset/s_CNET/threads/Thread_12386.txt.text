i have a cdrw lg gce-8481b 40x24x48x that as of today does not want to open when the button is pressed and neither does it open when i right click the drive and hit &quot;eject&quot;. i thought these things were built to last forever. i have a pretty decent psu 450 watts, so i would not ping the problem on it. is it time for a new cdrw unit? have you guys experienced anything like this? i would at expect the button to open the drive, even if it did not record or read any disc at all. gp
i wish. all cd drives have a high failure rate. cdrw drives seem to fail more often than cdrom drives. the laser in the cdrw may be the most susceptible to failure. have you tried cleaning the laser with a cleaning cd? have you checked in device manager to see what is reported there? i usually try installing the drive in another computer to check if it works there. if all fails, you can easily replace the drive. i find them at $19.95 after mail-in rebates, regularly, at all the major retailers in my area.
there is usually a small hole on the drive just push an office pin there and press the open button, it will work, but in the near fututre think of the new drive... repairing isnt the best option
