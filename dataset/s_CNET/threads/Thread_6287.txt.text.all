<s> i just got a new laptop with vista home installed and need to know if i need to install the vista printer driver on it to be able to use my dell aoi 962 printer which is connected to my decktop running xp with all updates.  </s>
<s> my last setup i had xp on both my desktop and laptop and i downloaded the printer driver from the desktop to the laptop.  </s>
<s> i do not know if the xp driver will work with vista.  </s>
<s> dell has a vista driver on their web site for this printer, just need to know if i need to download this driver and install it before trying to share this printer across the network.  </s>
<s> i have three systems one with 98se, xp which is the main system and the laptop (do not print from the 98 system, only used for grandkids games).  </s>
<s> all systems are able to see and transfer files to each other.  </s>
<s> thanks swijo  </s>
<s> is to go to drivers and downloads select model choose printer printer again now find your printer download and install the vista utilities and patches for your vista machine.  </s>
<s> you only need to do this for your vista machine.  </s>
<s> if i'm reading this correctly, your printer is hooked to the xp machine.  </s>
<s> also read the information on printer sharing and many other items that may apply, there are 2 pages, at our forum sticky .  </s>
<s> if you still cannot do all your functions, you may want to consider fixing your network first, like the forum sticky suggests.  </s>
<s> unsure if you'll need to use the vista patch on the xp machine, if any.  </s>
