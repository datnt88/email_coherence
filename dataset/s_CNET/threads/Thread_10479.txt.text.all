this may be a dumb question, but i'm having a cable modem installed today and need to know if the cards i already have in my pcs are wireless &quot;internet&quot; cards. 
i know they will work for lan, but, will they work with a router for wireless access to the internet? 
is to look for an antenna protruding from the card. 
next i would check the model for any wireless capabilities. 
some think this is cnet's support site. 
nope, that's over at cnetusa.com in answer to your question, almost all ethernet cards are for wired connections.
