<s> this may be a dumb question, but i'm having a cable modem installed today and need to know if the cards i already have in my pcs are wireless &quot;internet&quot; cards.  </s>
<s> i know they will work for lan, but, will they work with a router for wireless access to the internet?  </s>
<s> is to look for an antenna protruding from the card.  </s>
<s> next i would check the model for any wireless capabilities.  </s>
<s> some think this is cnet's support site.  </s>
<s> nope, that's over at cnetusa.com in answer to your question, almost all ethernet cards are for wired connections.  </s>
