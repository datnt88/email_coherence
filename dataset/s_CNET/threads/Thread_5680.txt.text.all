<s> i purchased a hp monochrome laser printer and would like to connect it to my airport network.  </s>
<s> at hp's website they show a bluetooth device which plugs into the printer's usb port.  </s>
<s> my question is will this device work with my airport network?  </s>
<s> given no model number i can't check if a wifi print server would work but bluetooth is something of a non-starter for many reasons. the number one reason is either it doesn't connect to wifi and the other being the 5 or more minute page printing time.  </s>

<s> i set one of these up on a mobile cart in a school and it worked fine.  </s>
<s> bluetooth is a horse of another color and works only with other compatible hardware.  </s>
<s> the hp wireless device was bit pricey, as i recall, but it worked.  </s>
<s> others cost less and might work as well.  </s>
