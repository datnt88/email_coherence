<s> hello, i recently purchased a toshiba satellite a215-s5818 laptop (specs can be found at ) and it comes with atheros wireless lan 802.11a/g/n.  </s>
<s> i want to get a wireless router for my home, but which router should i get, 802.11a, 802.11g, or 802.11n?  </s>
<s> thanks a lot!  </s>
<s> any fine 802.11g router is good for &quot;the internet&quot; since your internet connection is much less than 54 megabit.  </s>
<s> 802.11n is good if you have more than one machine and want to copy over the air.  </s>

<s> so if i'm only going to use the router for this one laptop and possibly xbox 360 for xbox live, then a &quot;g&quot; router is the one to choose?  </s>
<s> even if both machines hit the net, your &quot;air speed&quot; is still many times of your internet connection speed.  </s>
