anyone know of a wireless router that can be configured remotely (either with a web interface or a telnet interface). 
i am setting up a wireless network, but i will not be on-site most of the time. 
i want to use mac address filtering, but i want to be able to filter mac addresses remotely. 
i have the microsoft g-router, and it doesn't support logging in remotely. 
does anyone know of a wireless g-router that supports remote administration? 
thanks
