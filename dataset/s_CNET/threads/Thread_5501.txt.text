specifically canon............i'm seeing more and more of the these 3rd party ink jet cartridges available. is it wise to use them, or am i risking gumming up my printer??
each maker has it's own story. with most printers being a 2 year affair maybe it's worth a shot if!!!! 1. the printer is old. 2. correct colors are not a big deal. i mean for a pie chart, red is red? bob
but after the warranty period, i've never had serious issues with third-party cartridges on my canons, except the occasional one that didn't work. but with a 50% difference in price, it's still a lot cheaper. kees
