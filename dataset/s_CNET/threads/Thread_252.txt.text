i have a compaq pc, 733 mhz, p3, 128mb ram, currently running an nvidia tnt2 graphics card. i'd like to upgrade the graphics, now that there are plenty of used g-force cards on the market. i play a lot of older games (unreal tournament, riven, madden 2002, ghost recon), but there are some newer games that i'd like to get which require a better graphics card. is there a noticeable difference between a g-force 2 and g-force 4 card? any other suggestions?
to be honest your gfx card upgrade wouldn't do an awful lot without the memory been upgrading too. i would check out the games you want to play and see what the system requirments are. the geforce 4 is quite a step up from the geforce 2, the tnt card were very good in their day like the gf2 mx 400's.
do as matt-page suggest, add at least another 128mb of ram before you do anything. it is not hard to do. check  for what type you will need for your particular pc. here are some old test of video cards that show performance rating under different games. april 2002  december 2002  i would suggest the geforce 3 ti-500, or the geforce 4 ti-4200.
my nephew has a similar system. but it's a 1ghz and 256mb. i fitted a dvdrom drive so he has his own dvd player too. at 733mhz, that's more than enough for dvd playback, but 128mb will be far too tight. i'd forget today's games on such a machine. but 512mb is not a bad idea. if you find a cheap!!! geforce 2gts or there abouts, it will deliver about 2x or better the graphic speed, but with that cpu and ram it will never be a gaming machine except for old titles (try the year 2000). bob
a very good card. cheap. need an agp slot, i'm not sure if they come connectable to standard pci slots.
geforce ti4200 with 64mb and after 2 years of heavy use it still competes with newer cards. i benchmarked (3dmarkse) against a new ati 9600 (256mb) and beat it handily. furthermore this card can be overclocked, however it can get unstable by doing so, so i leave it at the default settings. just make sure you have the agp slot like the previous poster said. it has a fan so it will drain a bit more power than your old card, i am guessing. gl
