i have the sims hot date cd but i lost the code so does anybody know where i can get a new code? please help!!!
why not go to their website and click on the help link to contact their tech support fora new code?
you mean you lost the cd case for the expansion pack? that's where the code is. each one is different. if you really lost it, you will have to uninstall your game and buy a new version of hot date so you have a new password.
weather you bought the cd on line or in the store, i'm sure their web page help will gladly help you out. i've bought things on line and lost or misplaced my code or password. if they have your name on file they will give you a code or new password...buying on line helps you because they send you an e-mail, usually with your user name and password, so any time you have to re-install they will send you to a site to re-install....good luck
the reason is in the forum polices... bob
