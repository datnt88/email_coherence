674	3	259120	2556178	2556176	r. proffitt	8/4/07 4:29 pm	1.18624494e12	it's a hard lesson for some.	remember that people have brought me these firewire problems for years. no one shows me a working system. yes somewhere for some it does work. but when people tell me of trouble you will get my take on firewire. again it's either another firewire + windows disaster or you have a defective drive. i read that you write formatting. tell me if you made the parttitions. if not, remove then, create them and try one more time. on xp i'd suggest a quick format. same for vista if you can since formatting large drives can take a very very long time. bob

674	5	259120	2556232	2556225	r. proffitt	8/4/07 5:49 pm	1.18624974e12	sorry.	but i try to never duplicate web content like how to partition in xp or vista. let's find some pages on that.  yes! the very first link is about how to use the vista partitioning tools. after i have removed the old partition i create it anew and format it (quick mode if possible). again it does not matter if firewire works on your camcorder. try usb if you fail on the firewire link. bob

674	7	259120	2556930	2556255	dutchens	8/6/07 12:17 am	1.18635942e12	.....	actually, someone told me something different about formatting. this also reminded me on how i reformatted my first external hdd. i opened up the command prompt window, typed in n: /fs:ntfs (yes, suddenly it became n. it used to be g: ) and so far it's working. it takes time but it's 14% complete now (almost 2 hours in the reformatting process).
674	8	259120	2556986	2556930	r. proffitt	8/6/07 5:06 am	1.18637676e12	that's why i use the quick format.	then scandisk or other tool later. bob
674	9	259120	2557276	2556986	dutchens	8/6/07 11:21 am	1.18639926e12	yay	after a long night, it has finally formatted now it's finally displaying on my computer when it's on and i can go into it woot.
