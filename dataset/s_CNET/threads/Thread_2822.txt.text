i have a linksys 802.11g wireless router/hub that works great. my problem is now that i've moved it to the basement, i can't connect from the 2nd or 3rd floors of my home (city living, not livin la vida loca). any suggestions on what to buy or do to extend my range?
is no place to put your wireless hub. your wireless hub should be in a central location so everyone can get a good signal from it. signals do not travel well through walls, metal and with all the interference, i would say you need to relocated it, again. rick
range extenders are available. just an example:  a drawback of extenders is that they decrease the throughput of your wlan.
try locating it on the basement ceiling directly below where you need to connect to. basements are not the right place for wifi routers. bob
