<s> is there a powerfull enought anteana on the market that can send a 360* signal for a distance of 10-40 miles?  </s>
<s> that was asked a bit ago. the problem is you need more watts plus that antenna.  </s>
<s> remember that an antenna does not add power to the signals.  </s>
<s> if can pick up more and be more efficient (less loss), but adds no power.  </s>
<s> a short discussion elsewhere found the power required at about 20 miles to be about 500 watts for 360 coverage.  </s>
<s> this is just one reason why a cellular type approach works.  </s>
<s> your answer is a simple no. bob  </s>
<s> &quot;think power.  </s>
<s> remember that 2.4gbz is that same frequency range as your microwave oven.  </s>
<s> now a little issue of how to double the coverage of a radio signal.  </s>
<s> you need 4 times the power for each doubling of the distance.  </s>
<s> starting at only 200 milliwatts for your best wifi wireless access point (wap) as a baseline, we can figure what it takes to reach out to you at 100 miles away.  </s>

<s> point to point, etc.. from google in case i was unclear... definitions of line of sight on the web: the line of sight is the line that connects the observer's eye with the thing the observer is looking at.  </s>
<s> this expression is often used with measurements of doppler velocity and magnetic field in magnetograms, where only that part is measured that is directed along the line of sight.  </s>
<s> to know the complete velocity or magnetic field, the components that are at right angles to the line of sight must also be measured.  </s>
<s> such components may be called the field-of-view components, though this expression is not commonly used.  </s>
