everex computer bought from vc store in 2000. 
win me worked fine the day before turned on next day screen showed: everex ever for excellence (across the middle of screen) across the bottom of the screen: press[tab]to show post screen, [del] to enter setup neither tab or del button does anything any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! 
tell every detail. 
what lights blink, do fans turn, does holding down the del key on power up do anything? 
you may be asking &quot;how do i repair my own pc?&quot; come right out and ask. 
be aware that you may have to test parts in other machines, put in a new motherboard cmos battery, clear the cmos settings, undo/remove recent added hardware, reset cards and such. 
are you ready to rip off the case cover?

did you check to see if the keyboard is plugged in to the tower?
