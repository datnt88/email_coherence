i have a lacie d2 quadra hard-drive that i've been using on a mac computer for several years. the mac computer that the drive was connected to is pretty much dead (held out for 8 years though!) and i need to transfer the files from the hard drive to a pc computer. i can plug the drive into a mac and it just mounts on its own, but nothing happens when i plug it into a pc. i read the manual and it says to format the drive as ntfs and it will appear in my computer folder. however, i am worried that formatting the drive will erase everything on it and i will loose all my data. does anyone have any experience with this? i've formatting smaller things like flash drives etc and i know that always erases the data, so i'd rather be sure about this before i do something stupid and erase every song and media file i've ever owned... any input would be great
copy your stuff out before formatting. and to share a little more, i found booting a livecd (no install!) called ubuntu (no learning linux!) let me access such drives and copy content out. bob
glad i asked! so is there no way to use my drive on a mac and pc without erasing everything? my sister has a mac and i have a pc (not for long hopefully...)
in my opinion, too unreliable. today's apples can use ntfs. so when you get your files safe, try ntfs next time. be safe! bob
