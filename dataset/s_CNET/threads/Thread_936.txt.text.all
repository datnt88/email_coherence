<s> ha thnx, ,,,, much help/advise wanted  </s>
<s> windows doesn't work with failing hardware well.  </s>
<s> so you need to follow directions.  </s>
<s> i see it told you to backup your files but it appears you didn't do that.  </s>
<s> instead you delayed and now are moving the failing drive to a new machine and complaining that windows doesn't like failing drives.  </s>
<s> go ahead and complain about that.  </s>
<s> when you are done you'll want to try going back to what did boot and work to get your files out.  </s>

<s> there's no telling by what you did.  </s>
<s> you should backup, then xfer files, them check for any malware.  </s>
<s> in fact, you should had checked for malware before xferring any files.  </s>
<s> it's possible to cause problems by xferring some malware as it attack continues, but normally, it should have been more obivous.  </s>
<s> if you have a true h/w fault, then getting problems now by xfering files is nil but again i don't know what total files they were.  </s>
<s> dell, has a know issue with losing hds under vista, check thier support website for details and/or check the forums of theirs.  </s>
<s> run some anti-virus tests or use the free online services check here at virus&security forum for links to same.  </s>
<s> good luck ------willy  </s>
<s> no no no i didnt move my drive i was backing up my old data just to a new computer by using the data transfer thing in vista ... i was saying that could my new hd failed beacuse i brought a virus over from my old computer ... so i most likely shouldnt tranfer my files or if i do use a scan on em ...  </s>
<s> i wouldn't discount anything.  </s>
<s> let's look at a recent disaster.  </s>
<s> the owner was a p2p user downloading cracked software.  </s>
<s> they had no end of troubles on all their machines.  </s>
<s> frankly i think they should get a mac since this may be the only cure for them since they are convinced windows is buggy as ell.  </s>
<s> they can't see the cracks for what they are.  </s>
<s> their last comment was that norton (yet another cracked software!) should have protected them. the protection starts with us.  </s>
<s> no, i'm not saying you have such an issue but thinking that norton or other software will stop today's pests is wishful thinking.  </s>
