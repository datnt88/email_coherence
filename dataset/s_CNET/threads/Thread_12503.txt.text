hello, i have been burning cds without any problems, until now. sometimes, the computer will freeze during a burn and i have to restart it. then, if i try the process again it may burn ok. it appears to be absolutely random. any suggestions. regards, bert. amd athlon xp 2800+ abit nf7-s2 motherboard windows xp pro 5.01.2600 sp2 aopen duw 1608/12x - firmware a080 driver windows 5.1.2525.0 nero software version 6.6.1.4
no mention of power or cooling and the rest of the machine. however i'd like to read that the power supply is 450 or more watts and that you tried it with the cover off to sniff out cooling issues. in closing, no operating system was noted but if compatible i'd run housecall and ewido to eject what they find. bob
sometimes it just happens. even on a machine that is set up correctly and has no problems. happened to me yesterday. my explanation is &quot;gremlins&quot;. have never found a good reason, and have learned to not tear my computer apart looking for one. after closing nero and rebooting, same exact settings make a good burn. if it is more than a occasional thing, then look for a reason. chuck
