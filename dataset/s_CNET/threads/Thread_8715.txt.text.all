<s> my sound card is a auzen x-meridian 24bit/192khz high definition 7.1 channel surround sound board and i am running vista ultimate 32bit.  </s>
<s> my music is on my h disc and have 67gigs stored. the library contains everything from classical, electronic/dance, pop/rock, big band & swing, easy listening, new age and everything in between.  </s>
<s> i have looking at the logetech z-5500 because of the toslink optic conection but was a little disapointed that review reported that the mid range was a little muddy and the base was a little overpowering.  </s>
<s> i am limited to a budget of 220/250.  </s>
<s> any sugestions?  </s>
<s> mp3 being a lossy compression tends to lose its luster at standard bitrates you see used by 99% of us. the brilliance you speak of is only noticed on great speakers.  </s>
<s> try this on your current setup.  </s>
<s> play the cd version or better yet some hidef audio recording and then compare that version to your mp3 (or other) recording.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
