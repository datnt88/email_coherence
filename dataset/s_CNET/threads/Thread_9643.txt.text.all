<s> i recently changed my printer to a samsung clp 325 wireless model and it will not print from my epson scanner.  </s>
<s> i am thinking of buying a new canon canoscan lide 210 scanner to replace the epson.  </s>
<s> does anyone know if the canon scanner is compatible with wireless printers?  </s>
<s> unless i put a pc in between i see the old idea of direct scan from a scanner to a printer to be a thing of the past unless you get one of those all in one units.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks bob, i have contacted cannon support and they are unable to confirm if their scanner will definitely work with my samsung wireless printer.  </s>
<s> epson say their print untility feature on their scanners is only compatible with epson printers.  </s>
<s> rather suggests that the technology is there but the software is not!  </s>
<s> thanks glynn  </s>
<s> it's pretty simple why this is.  </s>
<s> look at the mess that printers are today.  </s>
<s> you find yourself installing drivers for each model.  </s>
<s> there is rarely a time you find that the driver for the model 860 works with the 850.  </s>
<s> (fictitious numbers) to cure that i would have to put a pc in the middle.  </s>
<s> why isn't the usual all-in-one a solution for you?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hi bob i agree with your view on multiple drivers.  </s>
<s> maybe now outdated but i prefer the seperate scanner and printer configuration and for really good quality photo scans i think a dedicated unit is better.  </s>
<s> for the moment i am just trying to find a decent scanner that will be compatible with my wireless samsung printer. the manufacturers support depts aren't much use as the reply is more often than not &quot;a definite maybe&quot; eg canon.  </s>
<s> not really much use unless you buy on a sale or return basis.  </s>
<s> hesi  </s>
<s> i fear that such is long gone.  </s>
<s> given the mess this is, i think we are stuck with a pc in the middle.  </s>
