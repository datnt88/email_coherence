i got this computer off ebay. since i got it i have not been able to get a sound out of it. when i look in device manager it shows me an unknown pci device, and of course i have no drivers forit. when i download the sound drivers off the compaq website supposedly for the computer i have, no luck no sound. i tried diabling the on-board sound and putting in my own sound card, but that hasn't worked either. any other things i can try?
of windows for this machine. without a restore cd, you need to research and install the motherboard drivers, sound, nic etc... the other possibility is the onboard sound is controlled by a jumper or the bios or is broken.
go to compaq.com. u can find drivers for their computers there.
i know that the computer came with windows me, the previous owner had them put win 98 on it. when i got the computer there was no sound, i wiped the drive with fdisk, then re-installed windows 98. i went to the compac site and looked up the specs on the computers origianl configuration and i downloaded 2 different drivers, neither one of them worked. i went to the bios and defaulted back to the origianl settings, that didn't help. how can i figure out what isn't working so i can fix that. i downloaded the manual on the particular kind of motherboard it is, and there is no new info there. in startup it recognizes a pci card, but never lets me download drivers. this is a basic system, no extras. i can't believe that it just isn't going to work, and if that is true, why didn't my sound card work? perhaps i need to go with name brand that comes with a disk. help!
&quot;perhaps i need to go with name brand that comes with a disk. help!&quot; ebay = let the buyer beware
