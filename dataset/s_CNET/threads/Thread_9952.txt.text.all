<s> i just purchased this set up from best buy under the advice of some of the staff and the only problem i can't figure out is where the powersource should connect to the new card.  </s>
<s> there are a few options, but none seem the right size for the available slot.  </s>
<s> i would be grateful for any assistance.  </s>
<s> the nvidia card has 6 holes and the emachine has two 4 holes and another large plug w/ at least a dozen.  </s>
<s> all are attached to the motherboard (a 4 is by itself and the other two are paired together in one big slot) the nvidia also came with an adapter to fit its 6 holes and the adapter splits into two, each one having three large prongs at the end, instead of holes.  </s>
<s> those connectors are the type used by your cd/dvd drive.  </s>
<s> look at the photos of this power supply: antec basiq 500w power supply cables and connectors emachines usually have very small (low wattage) power supplies that aren't intended for decent video cards.  </s>
<s> that's why they don't have the 6pin pcie power connector those video cards require.  </s>
<s> i suggest you get a good 450-500w power supply for your pc. (such as the antec basiq).  </s>
