i have been noticing that whenever i disconnect from my wpa wireless network, my usb ports don't work. whenever i plug in my flash drives, my laptop is not able to see them. then, when i shut down, my laptop just hangs. i use a dell e1505 with windows xp media center.
if the flash drive was already connected before i disconnect, i can still read them, but i cannot safely remove it.
i've encountered such things but only when the owner installed the os. many forget to use dell's other cds with drivers and more. bob
haven't had this trouble before.
another cause was to accept a driver from windows update. fix? use driver rollback on that. bob
i have information: now, i noticed that my usb ports are not working whenever i press fn+f2 to deactivate my wireless. my laptop can't see any flash drives i plug in after turning off the wireless. the bluetooth manager also hangs. windows also freezes when shutting down. wireless internet works fine. when i restart the machine, everything is back to normal (usb ports, bluetooth work again). i don't know what's happening. but below is a breakdown let say i just turned on my laptop: 1. with the wireless off, the usb ports work perfectly fine. 2. when i press fn+f2 to activate the wireless/bluetooth, usb ports still work fine. 3. when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wireless, usb ports don't work, and bluetooth also doesn't work. in the device manager, if i press fn+f2 to turn the wireless internet (wi-fi) on, under &quot;universal serial bus controllers&quot;, the dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card will appear. there should also be a sound as a sign that a new device installed/connected. then, when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wireless internet, dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card disappears from device manager. there should be also a sound that signals that a device is removed. what happens is that the &quot;dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card&quot; entry is not removed when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wi-fi. it is stuck there, and my usb ports are broken. for now, as a temporary solution, i have disabled the &quot;dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card&quot; in the device manager. still haven't encountered the problem yet.
