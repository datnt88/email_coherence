<s> hello, i currently have a 2002 dell dimension 8200 with 256k ram and am running xp professional. the type of ram the system has is rdram, which i found is quite expensive to upgrade even to 1gb. the computer runs very slow when multiple applications are being used.  </s>
<s> at this point i'm debating whether it would be best to upgrade the memory,purchase a new computer or even build my own.  </s>
<s> i've also been suggested to replace the motherboard so that a different type of ram module can be used.  </s>
<s> any suggestions would be helpful.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> running rdram (pc1066 ecc) reliably after 3-5 years.  </s>
<s> that said rdram is way way over priced and i recommend buying new versus upgrading what you have.  </s>
<s> check the deals over at techbargains.com....you can get a lot of pc for $500-$700.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> the os will likely fail.  </s>
<s> then you need a new cpu, maybe a new power supply and why stop there?  </s>
<s> try this.  </s>
<s> do what this link tells you to do -&gt; now review each item that you run and see if you really need it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hahaha im in the same situation, sort of, my dell is an 8250 from 01 though.  </s>
<s> the rdram is a sucky ram and there is no way id pay as much as i saw for it on dell's website.  </s>
<s> i have chosen to build my own pc. i think a barebone kit from tigerdirect.com would be a great spark for you to think what it is you want.  </s>
<s> now, they do have a barebone kit up there that you can build with up to a 1tb hard drive with 3gb of cache speed on it at 7200 rpm with the xp pro option, and lots of great upgrades, xp holds 4gb of ram so ..... yeah.  </s>
<s> dell shorted me out on that, i have 512mb.  </s>
<s> i think dell says if u don't use their ram your warranty will be void but i'm guessing that's not a problem.  </s>
<s> if you go to then click &quot;scan my system&quot; it will show you the max ram, how many slots, what u have and what type you need.  </s>
<s> their prices are not bad.  </s>
<s> i'd shop around though.  </s>
<s> i recently went shopping for 1gb of ram at it cost $79 at staples, too much.  </s>
<s> i found the same thing at circut city for $29.  </s>
<s> just make shore you copy the info when you buy it such as how many pins it has.  </s>
<s> good luck  </s>
<s> it would be nice if they ever filled that in on their product line.  </s>
<s> but the last time i looked, no rdram.  </s>
<s> don't advertise or offer it now.  </s>
<s> i just checked ebay and a 1gb kit of 184pin, pc1066, ecc, was available for $279.95 with free shipping.  </s>
<s> &quot;dell dimension 8250 8200 1gb rdram rambus pc1066 32ns samsung ecc for all rambus systems, 400mhz/533mhz fsb&quot; a few years back i remember seeing a 4gb kit of 184 pin pc1066 rdram, ecc and the price was listed as $12,999.00 but it was 'out of stock'.  </s>
<s> at that prices...really wonder if it was ever in stock or if they ever sold any at that price.  </s>
<s> looks like pricing severely limited widespread use of rdram and ultimately gave rise to the design, manufacture and sale of ddr, ddr2, ddr3 and so on once the agreement between rambus and intel expired.  </s>
<s> cheers.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> prices are astronomically high.  </s>
<s> see post below for pertinent details.  </s>
