(it says it is a &quot;vista ready&quot; machine) i admit that this problem is completely unordinary and i have never seen anything like it before. however, it is a new laptop so maybe i am one of the first to report it. it is just so strange that the bios would see the ram but the os is only seeing 1/8 of the total physical memory. please help! thanks.

1027	5	234198	2408917	2408543	jacomus1	2/19/07 8:34 pm	1.17191724e12	i think you were right and thank you...	i am still working on this but i see a couple of things. for one, when i installed xp pro i received a blue screen error because the hp recovery partition on the second drive had a listing in the mbr. the &quot;fixmbr&quot; and &quot;fixboot&quot; command failed to fix this so i deleted that partition and i no longer received the blue screen and could boot into windows. (i did create the recovery cd's) upon doing this, the drive letter changed from c:\ to e:\ in which windows was installed. despite the fact that it boots perfectly, when accessing the boot.ini file i receive the error &quot;windows cannot open c:\boot.ini&quot; yet it still boots!! and even more confusing, when i enter setup after booting from the (&quot;educationally discounted&quot; non-pirated) xp cd, setup sees the 2 100gb hard drives seperately but with the same identification. e.g they both read: 95394 mb disk(0) at id(0) on bus(0) on atapi [mbr]. it is if it sees the 2 hd as 1 logical disk yet lists them seperatley. windows will not let me create a boot.ini file and i am afraid to alter the registry to force a change in drive letters for the primary system volume. i am still really confused but i think you nailed where the problem lies and i appreciate it. james
