i have using the following configured system currently. 1 gb dynet ram, 500gb seagate hdd, intel duel core processer, inter dg31pr motherboard and galaxy gs8400 graphics card. following issues i am getting frequently, 1)
look for a techky friend and don't use that repair shop anymore. you need a new harddrive or did they put a new one in? try solving one problem at a time. sometime it might be cheaper just to get another computer. you have a floppy drive? if yes, try booting up the computer in dos. this way you will bypass the harddrive. that's how i do it when i check out a new computer. computers are very complicated when you don't know what you are doing but it's very simple when you do.
if data is critial then back-up now or asap in order to be safe with that. next, any noise its best to follow your ear and check it out. you say its the hd, but if it was causing that much noise it would fail. if not the hd, it maybe simply vibration or resonance of metal when hd is accessing. most minor noise is from hd but it should be very slight. systems freeze for various reasons and if you're intense on pc usage, just give it some more time as you didn't state when it freezes during what process, like photo editing or such, what task is being done that seems to cause a freeze. a possible cause of noise is the fan(s) within the system. again, check operation that may allow fan to seize, etc. for it kicks in into a higher rpm, in order to cool the system. what about fan on video card, check it out. are there other fans in case as well? clean the ram slots with alcohol and toothbrush or similar and allow to dry out, retry afterwards and check results. review what you come across and report back. tada -----willy
