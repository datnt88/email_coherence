<s> i am looking for an external hard drive to back my pictures and music to.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> i would like to keep the price under $150.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> keep in mind i like the word backup but these externals are still not reliable enough to call them storage.  </s>
<s> they are pretty reliable but one drop or oops delete and your last copy is gone.  </s>
<s> i see many under 99 buck externals on amazon,.  </s>
<s> newegg and at the stores so it's easy to get one and backup what you have today.  </s>

<s> ok, so they are not as reliable as a computer hard drive?  </s>
<s> am i understanding you correctly?  </s>
<s> are there other options?  </s>
<s> i have a site online where i keep my photos and i have them on my desktop hard drive as well.  </s>
<s> but my desktop is getting very old and i seldom use it, except to store pics/music.  </s>
<s> because inside a computer it has a case to take the brunt of the impact.  </s>
<s> folk that drive their copies down to one last copy on any single device tend to lose them all.  </s>
<s> if you have an old machine and use this for a backup copy, that's a good idea.  </s>
<s> but it's only the first line of defense.  </s>
<s> here i have our family photo collection on no less than 3 devices.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i see.  </s>
<s> what do you mean by &quot;one last copy&quot;?  </s>
<s> i've never had any problems losing music or photos...of course i realize that doesn't mean it could happen.  </s>
<s> i'm just afraid my desktop will give up some day.  </s>
<s> if you move your files to this external for &quot;storage&quot; and have them only there, that's the last copy.  </s>
<s> if you copy them there as &quot;backup&quot; then if your pc fails, you have a copy to bring back to your new system.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ok, yes i understand what you are saying.  </s>
<s> thank you!  </s>
