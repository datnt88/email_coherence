i got an old pentium 4 hyperthreaded, and when i run any of the three standard torture tests in prime95, my cpu processing tends to stay at approximately %50. it jumps higher for a millisecond or so once in a while, but it tends to stay at 50. shouldn't it be at %100? ive noticed this tendency in other applications as well.
you can run 2 instances to make it go to 100.
if i try to do that it automatically closes the new one
read this for an explanation:  with a hyper-threaded p4, you should not run two instances of prime95 since you don't have 2 cpus.
i used to do that with the old seti program on my ht and it worked fine with more results per hour. i guess prime95 is a different beast. bob
prime95 is. launch 2 of them on an ht p4 and it will be next-to-unusable.
the idea was to get it to max out the cpus and since i was not at the machine, just what i wanted. bob
