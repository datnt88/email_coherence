video capture device. it can be a pci or usb device. you install it on the pc, connect your tv inputs, satellite, cable, or off the air to the suplied connectors, use the software that came with the device, save the program to the hd, play it back on the pc, use the software to &quot;capture&quot; a still image, save it as .jpg or .bmp. wayne do not condemn the judgment of another because it differs from your own. you may both be wrong. - dandemis click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software.
