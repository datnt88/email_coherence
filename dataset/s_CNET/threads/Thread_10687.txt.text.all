<s> i have a linksys wrt54g wireless router.  </s>
<s> i originally ran the setup cd using my old desktop.  </s>
<s> however, i just bought a new dell laptop and will be getting rid of the old desktop for good. the laptop is already on the wireless network and works great, but i want to make sure i'm not messing up anything by getting rid of the computer where the router was intalled.  </s>
<s> is there anything i need to do to the new laptop as far as settings so that it knows the desktop won't ever be back.  </s>
<s> i am particularly curious because on the setup page, the host name is &quot;desktop&quot;, so i must have had to identify the machine somewhere in the setup (i wish i remembered!). all machines run windows xp home.  </s>
<s> somebody please provide advice.  </s>
<s> thanks!!!  </s>
<s> with that you can always configure any pc/laptop so its ok to get rid of the old pc  </s>
<s> i have the cd. should i do anything with it now, or just hang on to it in case of problems in the future?  </s>
<s> thanks for your response.  </s>
<s> you don't have anything to do with the cd... keep it in a safe place... as for the old pc... i don't know what are you going to do.. but don't forget to backup your data... then if possible format it..  </s>
<s> thanks for your help.  </s>
<s> and as for the old computer, i've already transferred my data.  </s>
<s> i am giving it to a friend and plan to reformat the hard drive first.  </s>
<s> i know that won't make my data completely uncovereable, but i don't know of any free programs for that, so reformating is the best i can do.  </s>
<s> thanks again!  </s>
<s> try the drive cleanser or eraser 5.3.  </s>
<s> ... google it  </s>
