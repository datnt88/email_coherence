a few yrs. ago a small &quot;simplified pc&quot; was promoted for a short while. it was just for email & internet connections; maybe w/ an integrated screen. i want just that for a second home in fl......as cheaply as possible; for email & to pay bills. small size would be a plus as well. a really cheap notebook would be ideal, but they're not so cheap in my eyes. any suggestions are welcome. thanks.
starts at 299 and can wipe out thousand dollar machines from just 2 years ago. best of luck, bob
well there is dell, hp, gateway, apple, sony, monarch, abs, shuttle, alienware, yeah, all of these companys have basic, budget pcs. anything with a celeron is a budget, look at emachines. konny
if you don't mind refurb,  has some really good deals. pentium3 systems starting at $89, and laptops from $129.
also you could look at an sff box, but those will cost more another option would be to wait for amd's planned pc, which is designed for just what your looking for, but i'd like to note that it's going to be very slow (and projected msrp is like $249) that dell wouldn't be a bad deal for a second pc another thing i'd like to say, it might not entirely &quot;blow away&quot; a $1000 pc from 2 years ago my pc is almost that old, and cost about that much 2 years ago, and i gurantee that even before upgrades, it could eat that dell alive and i'm pretty sure my hp from 2k1 could too (if it was still together, i parted out some of it and just have the cpu and hard disk now, and it's a lot more powerful (as i added a geforce fx 5900 to replace it's geforce 2mx)
(after rebates) while reading the special in store flyer at compusa. the special sale is only through july 9. it should meet your requirments:
of course, you get xandros instead of windows.
you can order pretty cheap hardware on newegg. a very cheap sempron/celeron and 128mb ram should do good.
amd2000+ sempron 40gb hd 128mb ram, no rebate $179 but with linspire 4.5. yes there are lots of low cost pcs out there. john
