i want to show my windows xp based slide shows on my hdtv. problem is the computer, the tv and where i would sit are not in line-of-sight of each other. is there a mouse or mouse/keyborad combination that might work for me?
you can see why you don't see these items on store shelves. bob
thank you but ouch! ok, let me rethink my plan. thanks for the help!
