is their a way to mirror two drives on a win2000 pro box without upgrading to win2000 server? 
third party software may be an option. 
use scopy to copy the drive daily from one to the other. 
better yet, use acronis to save an image when you like to the other drive.

i.e. , writing to the two drives simultaneously, is a hardware matter -- you need a raid controller, and it must be configured as raid 1. (raid 0 is striping, which is faster but without redundancy and with a greater chance of failure.) bob's workaround is, in essence, backup; this does have some advantages. 
a major disadvantage, however, is that backups take time. 
if i were going that route i would, as bob recommends, choose acronis true image. 
to save time, those important things needing frequent backup -- mainly data & documents -- in a separate partition, and then do partition imaging. 
imho, the same idea applies to a raid 1 system. 
in my case the single c drive contains the os, program files, relatively unimportant data, and other items that do not change frequently. 
this drive is backed up only as needed. 
my d drive, which is a pair of drives i raid 1 configuration, gets the more important and changable data. 
hope this helps frank
