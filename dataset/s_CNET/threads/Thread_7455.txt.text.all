i want to know if i would be able to replace the gpu in this apu ( ) with another, better, gpu ( ). i'm not exactly sure how apu's work so i decided to come to the experts for help. 
you'll need a pcie slot on the mobo. 
you'll need the physical space around that slot to accept the card. 
you'll need a 600w+ psu. 
is the pcie the pci expansion/express slot? 
i'm really confused i'm getting as mobo, so i might be able to get a little more help. 
the mobo you linked to has a pci-e x16 slot......that's good and what the gpu needs.
