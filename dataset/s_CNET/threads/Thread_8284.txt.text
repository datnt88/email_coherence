i recently got a new power supply for my dell dimension 8100. and now i can't turn my computer on. the on/off button flashes orange when power is going to the computer and when i touch it, nothing happens. i know power is getting to the motherboard, so i think the power supply is fine. thanks
check ur connections. must not have plugged in the psu to something maybe hard drive, cpu fan, etc. make sure everything has power and its connected securely. it would also help if u mention the make of the new psu.
if this is a dell from '96 to 2000 they used a different power supply and mobo and if they were not hooked up just right, they got fried. i hope this didnt happen to you. they werent interchangeable with industry standard stuff.
finally started using the standard atx wiring. at least i hope so for the sake of this gentleman. he has to check with dell. the reverse could also have happened if he bought a supply for an older dell model, that is not wired to the atx standard. a standard atx connected to the older dell's definitely zapped the mobo.
thanks guys - ill check the connectinos and whatnot. one thing though - the light on the motherboard turns on when power is going to it... does that mean it is not fried?
