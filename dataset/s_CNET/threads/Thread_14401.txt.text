i have wpa-psk enabled on my netgear wireless setup, with access limited by mac address. suddenly i have a mac address showing up as an attached device which is not on my wireless card access list. how do i find out who/what this is, and how do i block access?
unplug ethernet connections and reboot said router, clear that list and check again. one friend fretted long and hard and it turned out to be a device on the wire.
that cleared everything off the network except me. how did your friend come to decide it was &quot;a device on the wire&quot; as opposed to an outside/uninvited user?
plugged in one ethernet plug at a time and watched the screen. i showed him where the mac number was on one device and he was able to figure it out from there. bob
