<s> hi there, my o/s is corrupted and i need to install it into another machine as a slave, so i can transfer the files i cannot afford to lose off of it, before i format it. is this possible, and if so, can someone explain how.  </s>
<s> thanks daren  </s>
<s> sorry, should have said need to transfer hard drive to another machine, not o/s.  </s>
<s> today's machines use 80 conductor ide cables and all drives set to cable select.  </s>
<s> i only need to find an open ide connection and plug the drive there and then the power, then power up to get at the files.  </s>
<s> if you don't have 80 conductor ide cables then you get to learn about jumpers.  </s>
