graphics card: geforce fx 5500  os: windows xp i cant install the wdm drivers for tv tunning either from the cd or if downloaded from the website (the two 1.1 mb drivers) it shows error as &quot;the device cannot start (code 10)&quot;
does your card have a tv tuner built into it? i don't see that in the description on the site?
i dont see a tv tuner on it. tough, the box mentions &quot;tv features&quot; on it. anyways, my video-in drivers are now working fine. the only thing not is &quot;nvidia wdm tvtuner&quot;. the problem i have now, is that i cant recieve a full screen video. i recieve channels, but not full screen. i use windvd creator. what other options do i have?
