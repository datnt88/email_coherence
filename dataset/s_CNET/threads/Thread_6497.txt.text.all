<s> time for plan b. i decline to explain why you can't use these.  </s>
<s> let's move to solutions rather than waste time on this.  </s>
<s> any sugestions on how i may get the other pc on the network?  </s>
<s> but none would use that modem you noted.  </s>
<s> sorry but it's up to you to narrow down what solutions you can use.  </s>
<s> are you refering to the netgear or mega modem?  </s>
<s> a wireless network card to the new pc.  </s>
<s> but we covered this.  </s>

<s> i would like to go wireless but as said the distance is too big.  </s>
<s> i'm not getting a good anough signal.  </s>
<s> in our forum sticky i note how to use a wifi router as a wap.  </s>
<s> you could use that as a second wap that you place closer to your final destination.  </s>

<s> i have a suggestion for you.  </s>
<s> i also have adsl motorola surfboard and i use comcast service which is hooked up thru my desktop (dell dimension).  </s>
<s> i also have a wireless laptop, and it works ok,(dell latitude)but i wanted to hang out in another part of the room, naturually, so i got a cheap wireless modem (belkin for the laptop, and purchased a very long lan line,(about 20 to 30 feet) & hooked it up from the motorolla surfboard modem (about 20 feet across the room) to the wireless belkins modem, with the lan line (network cable) and a short one as well, to hook up one of 3 other connections.  </s>
<s> (i removed the lan line from the desktop tower, and hooked it from modem to modem, then the short one from wireless modem to laptop!  </s>
<s> i wish i could draw u a diagram.  </s>
<s> anyway, somehow it is working.  </s>
<s> if not, get a stick and just put it in your desktop, let it set up a connection, then use it for a wireless connection in your laptop, and be sure you write down the information it gives you on the connections, or save it on notepad or wordpad.  </s>
<s> i hope this helps, and by the way, i do not have a phone line, got rid of it years ago!  </s>
