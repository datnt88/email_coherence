<s> i have a microsoft wheel mouse optical and am running xp. ever so often the pointer onscreen locks up and will not move. the keyboard work and i am able to restart the computer, which resets the pointer, but after a few hour and in the middle of a game or program, the pointer will lock up again.  </s>
<s> i've downloaded the updated software from the microsoft web site and the problem remains.  </s>
<s> anyone know what the problem is and how to fix it or do i need to buy a new mouse?  </s>
<s> try this.  </s>
<s> remove the computer's case cover to sniff out if there is a heat issue.  </s>
<s> why?  </s>
<s> just another few posts about this and it was an issue.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i agree with robert as you may have the beginning of a heat issue.  </s>
<s> maybe a simple cleaning of compents(blow it out) will help.  </s>
<s> a possible system case fan may have failed unknown to you, so inspect *all* fans and such.  </s>
<s> you can also, just walk away from the system and see if the mouse unfreezes.  </s>
<s> if it unfreezes, then its doing something in the bkgrd.  </s>
<s> and temporary sucks the resources at that time, use you anti-virus scanner and/or trojan scanner to best handle any malware at work.  </s>
<s> understand also overtime, things get clogged system wise, thus abit of house cleaning maybe in order, review all pgms, to keep or remove.  </s>
<s> look into the above or get back with your results.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
