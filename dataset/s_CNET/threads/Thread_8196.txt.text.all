<s> i have a toshiba 51h84c hdtv-crt, and i was going to hook up my computer to it through dvi converted to hdmi, but then i saw in the manual: note: this tv should not be used with a pc. is there any reason why it would state this?  </s>
<s> also, could someone explain to me the whole dvi-d and dvi-i thing and which ones would work on a tv? and another thing, i am using an dvd player through component (y, pb, pr) and even though i select widescreen for all the settings, it still comes out as 4:3 with those bar things on the top and bottom, is it becuase component is a analog signal?  </s>
<s> also, one more thing... my tv only came with one hdmi port, would this be a problem in the future?  </s>
<s> because i plan to get hd cable and a hd dvd player, which would require 2 ports, what would i be able to do about this?  </s>
<s> there was a discussion about this subject but i can seem to located that thread though.  </s>
<s> if my recollection is correct...you could connect a computer to the tv, except the tv has to on first before the turning on the computer, otherwise the hdmi will not recognize the dvi connection.  </s>
<s> on the subject of dvi; dvi-i will support both digital and analog signals and dvd-d will only support digital.  </s>
<s> on the 4:3 thing; are you sure the material you are viewing is wide screen?  </s>
<s> other than that, i don't know what to say (tv and dvd got so dawn many adjustments).  </s>
<s> one hdmi port; don't know too much about them but i think that may be normal.  </s>
<s> the whole idea about hdmi is its universal connection..like usb on computer.  </s>
<s> hope this help a little.  </s>
<s> my brain is all tapped out, hehe.  </s>
<s> my dvd's are widescreen, dunno why it comes out like that.  </s>
<s> and... i've heard some people with issues about dvi-i and dvi-d compatability with hdmi, has anyone heard about this before?  </s>
<s> how do i tell if my dvi port is dvi-i or dvi-d?  </s>
<s> you can't tell the difference by looking at the connector, so i guess your best bet would be to consult the manual.  </s>
<s> it appears that dvi comes in two favor (single link and dual link).  </s>
<s> single link is 18 pins and dual link is 24 pins. the dual link is the one that gives you the best graphic.  </s>
<s> if you are connecting the video card to a dvi port and not to a vga connection then it doesn't matter what you have.  </s>
<s> that's the best i can do..good searching!  </s>
