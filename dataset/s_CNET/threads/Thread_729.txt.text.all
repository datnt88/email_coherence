<s> is it the cpu or video card that is the main culprit in lowering game performance?  </s>
<s> in other words, i have an amd 2700+ (~2.01 ghz) and a 9600xt.  </s>
<s> if i were to uprade one, which one should it be to boost gaming performance?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> thus you got the nt [no text], went back and added text but failed to remove the nt. so then it looks as if your message has a subject line only. the subject line is so vague that many won't bother.  </s>
<s> possibly make the post again without the nt, and then send a mod alert from this post of yours and ask them to remove it.  </s>
<s> they can then also remove my reply.  </s>
<s> most times the mods will comply.  </s>
<s> hi. what mobo are you on?  </s>
<s> some of them (like my abit nf7s2) will allow you to overclock athlons.  </s>
<s> my 2700+ is running at the same speed as a 3200+ by upping the bus from 333 to 400 and has been for 6 months.  </s>
<s> if you want to upgrade the processor to a worthwhile level, it will mean going to a new motherboard as well.  </s>
<s> for video, try an agp nvidia 6600gt.  </s>
<s> it really makes a difference over a 9600xt, honest.  </s>
<s> mine plays battlefield 2 and cs source at 1280x1024 no problems.  </s>
