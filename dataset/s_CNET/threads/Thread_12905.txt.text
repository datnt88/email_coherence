i am running xp os and i installed a airlink model awlh3026. it recognizes my wireless network but it will not connect to the internet. if i try to launch a browser, i get the message &quot;page can not be displayed.&quot; is there something that needs to be set on my router? my router is a linksys model befw11s4. thanks in advance.
verify that there is a default gateway assigned. your network will function fine without one but, it is required to access the internet.
from a dos window type ipconfig. it should be 192.168.x.y. x is usually 0 or 1. if you see an ip address of 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.y.z then your laptop failed to get an ip address. did you configure wep? maybe the keys are mismatched. you can also try assigning a static address to the wireless card. make sure the first 3 octets of the address are the same as the router and pick an ip address that is not in use or in the dhcp address pool. then see if you can ping the router. skrall
