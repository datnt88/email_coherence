<s> wondering on this.  </s>
<s> my dad says i need a laptop to take around and everything, like to show photos to family on trips, etc. i know that would be nice and everything, but we don't travel a whole lot.  </s>
<s> maybe 5 times a year to go to cincinati, since we live in lexington kentucky, and that's only for a day.  </s>
<s> then, maybe a large trip once every three years or so.  </s>
<s> now i'm also looking at the new imac's which i'm really liking the look of.  </s>
<s> they look awesome to me.  </s>
<s> i really liked the new keyboard.  </s>
<s> (just tried it today) i would like to get the 20in or 24in in either way.  </s>
<s> high or low one.  </s>
<s> to watch movies on in my room and the shows i buy off itunes.  </s>
<s> thanks treemen  </s>
<s> why not use one of the image sharing companies out on the web for this?  </s>
<s> better yet, get the .mac  </s>
<s> service and use the new iphoto and iweb sharing options to build your own, online picture gallery.  </s>
<s> you can pass word protect it and allow others to post their pics as well.  </s>
<s> download the new pod cast highlighting ilife 08 and its new features!  </s>
<s> credit to kevin for originally posting this link over in se... also, a portable thumb drive allows you to take gigs of photos anywhere and display them on any computer available.  </s>
<s> laptops are nice but if all you need is a way of sharing photo's then there is no reason to get one.  </s>
<s> grim  </s>
<s> thanks alot.  </s>
<s> i just had my first day of high school here and i'm in the ib program there.  </s>
<s> some real big program.  </s>
<s> and from what my teachers said today, we'll have plenty of writing things to do.  </s>
<s> so i'm trying to decide if a laptop would be better or not.  </s>
<s> what ever i buy is going to last for about 3 years, until i get out of high school, so for now the imac might be better, then a few years from now get the laptop.  </s>
<s> i trying to think of a way to earn something like $200 a month, so buy the time i get out of high school and into summer i'll have enough money to buy my new mac, or maybe even before then.  </s>
<s> thanks and keep the info coming.  </s>
<s> treemen  </s>
<s> where can i get autocad.  </s>
<s> i'm starting an engineering class and would also use it for college after high school.  </s>
<s> thanks treemen  </s>
<s> if you want autocad, you can go to the autodesk - student site.  </s>
<s> it will require a school based email address to register with the site.  </s>
<s> once you get registered you can down load a student version of autocad for free (last year they were giving a choice of the civil engineering or the electrical engineering versions... which both include the basic version).  </s>
<s> one thing.  </s>
<s> autocad only runs in a windows environment.  </s>
<s> if you have a ms machine or if you have a mac-intel capable of booting up in windows you will be covered.  </s>
<s> if you have a power pc mac then you are out of luck in running autocad.  </s>
<s> i think i decided on the mb or mbp.  </s>
<s> don't know which one yet.  </s>
<s> i'm leaning towards the mb, since i can hopefully buy the extra monitor, new camera, and speakers, etc, with the money i save.  </s>
<s> so, say i went with the pro, i might not be able to get a new camera or monitor.  </s>
<s> don't know yet though.  </s>
<s> and if i bought this to replace my pc, then should i go with the pro over the mb. thanks treeman  </s>
<s> i'm pretty good at using autocad, but not sure about the equipment requirements.  </s>
<s> since autocad is a vector line program... is a more powerful graphics card essential for its smooth running on a mac book booting to windows?  </s>
<s> if it was a raster based image i would say you need the beefier video support the mbpro offers, but since it is a vector based image the program displays then is the processor power more important?  </s>
<s> i will have to look this up.  </s>
<s> along these lines... has anyone here got an opinion about mac-cad ?  </s>
<s> cheers grim  </s>
<s> i went into a local electronics store and tried to type on the macbook keyboard.  </s>
<s> it wasn't pretty.  </s>
<s> my hands are too large. the mb pro keyboard looks identical but i had a much better experience typing on it, fewer errors and overall just a better feel.  </s>
<s> before you decide on which computer to buy you should go to the store and demo all of them.  </s>
<s> good luck!  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hey guys .. i have the same problem but worse !!! i live in egypt now and i'm going to canada the next year and i even don't know if i'll use a laptop on my studies in the high school or not .  </s>
<s> i agree that the macbook is a very good choice for a high school student .  </s>
<s> but me for example .. i like it but the 13 inch is too small and even if i bought the blach one and with a 2gb of memory i will have that 64 mb of graphics wich suck !!! so as a student and homeworks or projects its good but as a gamer or musician it's bad and by the way i can bye a good dell laptop with the same price and 15.4 inch monitor and geforce 256mb of graphics .  </s>
<s> so i think there are lots of people or &quot;students&quot; having this issue.  </s>
<s> right now i don't know what to do but i think if there is someone bought a macbook before , he can tell us about he's experiense .. oh , one more question .. on the website of apply the say for example .. &quot;as low as 50 a month &quot; ok for how long ?!!! i think that's all .. bye ,  </s>
