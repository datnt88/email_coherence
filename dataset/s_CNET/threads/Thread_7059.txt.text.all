<s> dell xps one 24 is the only one that has a quad core processor (that l know of)... so... are there any other powerful all in ones?  </s>
<s> you'll have to build your own.  </s>
<s> nothing on the horizon that i've heard of.  </s>
<s> (but we all know that could change anytime)  </s>
<s> all the major brands carry them dell, acer, etc., etc., etc.. i'd click &quot;performance and entertainment&quot; instead of &quot;all in ones&quot;.  </s>
<s> all these have intel i7 cpus: all these have intel quads (hmmm, what was that other processor brand; hmm, oh well i forget.  </s>
<s> ): on the high end: did you have a price in mind?  </s>
<s> this thread untracked  </s>
<s> 1) do i have the connection speed and connection reliability to play these games?  </s>
<s> and 2) does the games company i'm using have the hardware necessary to provide me with smooth and reliable service.  </s>
<s> are they currently hardware &quot;up to date&quot; or lagging well behind?  </s>
<s> i'm making two important points here for those that might understand.  </s>
<s> should be focusing on is the graphic card, not the processor.  </s>
<s> the weakness of an all-in-one is (just like a laptop) is that what you got is what you got. if you buy a game and your machine doesn't have enough graphic punch to run it, you're stuck.  </s>
<s> if you are dead set on getting an all-in-one, the dell xps one for $1800 is probably your best bet.  </s>
