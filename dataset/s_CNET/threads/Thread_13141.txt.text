is there a way to get my home internet conection on my cell? my cell doesnt have a wifi option, but it has blue tooth i thought maybe with the blue tooth function. i can create a network bridge. does any buddy know how to create this? (ps: my pc does have blue tooth)
you need help creating a network bridge?
there is no standard way of doing this. if you can't tell by reading  then it's likely you can't do it. bob
