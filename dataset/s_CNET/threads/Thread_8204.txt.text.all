<s> logitech z-5300e this is one of the first links that came up in the search: i then clicked on the &quot;specifications&quot; tab and saw that its frequency response is 35hz - 20khz.  </s>
<s> see if you can see a part number for the just the satellites.  </s>
<s> i couldn't find one at logitech.com.  </s>
<s> i've tried all that and i even emailed logitech about it but they gave me the same response you did (35hz-20khz) so not very helpful.  </s>
