<s> during the beginning installation of xp for my newly built computer... i see that i do not have all the components of xp (such as a calculator or windows media player).  </s>
<s> i'm suspecting that the error i saw during the installation (windows needs some files from the windows xp cd please insert into d: d:i368) well it is in... and everytime i click on ok doesn't do anything... so i'm suspecting that not sure.  </s>
<s> anyone know of any ways to resolve this issue of missing xp components ?  </s>
<s> usually during win.  </s>
<s> xp install, it saves the i386 folder somewhere.  </s>
<s> so go look in ur main partition (c: drive probabbly ) then windows&gt; should be in there  </s>
<s> the folder wasn't there... so i just moved it from the cd onto my harddrive but dunno what to do with it...??  </s>
<s> not sure...as this is the pc hardware forum..try the xp forum....best of luck to you tom  </s>
