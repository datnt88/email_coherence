my friend has offered to build me a pc if i buy him a motherboard. there are so many choices out there and i'm a noob anyway so i would like some suggestions. i need a motherboard that can handle games like age of empires 2, blood bowl, team fortress 2, portal 2, and other similar games. i don't think i particularly need a gaming computer but i want something reliable and capable to get me through college. any feedback would be appreciated thanks.
for gaming i find that just about any motherboard will do. i like to see the i5 cpu as you surely have read the following. &quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines. &quot;  with the motherboard and cpu out of the way, i like to pick a video card from this list. -&gt;  bob
check out asus maximus v, its pretty intresting, it has couple of different versions at different prices
