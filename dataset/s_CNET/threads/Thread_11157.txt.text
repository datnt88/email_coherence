i just bought this antec tp-ii 380 power supply and i found out that it dont have a -5v at the atx connector. after i connect it up it successfully boot up the system (mainboard using 20 pin atx connector). so i was wondering what was the -5v use for and will it affect the stability my pc. url for the power supply
the -5v was used in the ibm pc (the 8088 models) to power ram which at the time needed that supply. today, it's not used afaik. bob
another rail that i don't believe has been used in a while is the -12v
&quot;the full pci specification lists 5 volt, 3.3 volt, 12 volt and -12 volt power rails.&quot; -  while i can't recall a pci card that relied on the -12v line, it was also used in older rs232 driver chips that were used at least till the pentium 1 days. maybe longer. bob
it's only used on the atx 20-pin and the rail is like .5a or less
the common mc1488 needs a separate 12 volt supply. both +12 and -12 volt is required and not optional. this was a defacto standard in pc designs for decades and ... didn't require much power as you noted. bob
