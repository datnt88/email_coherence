<s> hi, everyone i have philips 107e 17&quot; crt monitor, and below monitor is bass speaker.is it bad for my monitor because i listen pretty loudly music, and when i volume up speakers i see some lines on screen.and,  </s>
<s> yes my monitor picture is shaking.could it because bass is draving power from sistem or it is just electromagnetic field?? thanx,fema  </s>
<s> this area is thankfully well discussed.  </s>
<s> it's all about physics but to keep it short i won't write about electrons, crts theory of operation but just share that it was 1897 when this was discovered.  </s>

<s> move speaker(s) or monitor away from each other, distance them.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> and most speakers do have fixed magnets. the volume at which you play the speaker isn't, itself, an issue but excessive vibration can damage just about anything.  </s>
<s> much will depend on just how close the speaker is to the crt and whether or not it's magnetically shielded.  </s>
<s> symptoms of damage from magnets are color and image distortion.  </s>
<s> you can easily see this by moving a smaller magnet around near the screen.  </s>
<s> most minor magnetic damage isn't fatal and some will be produced by components within the monitor itself.  </s>
<s> but, these tend to have automatic degaussing functions that reduce or eliminate the effects of magnetism.  </s>
<s> here's a youtube of what a magnet can do.  </s>
<s> maybe could be just an old monitor(8.5  </s>
<s> years) thank for replies,fema  </s>
