<s> hi all, i have an external hdd -500gb which powered electrically.  </s>
<s> it fell a few days ago and all it does now is beep, and it is not working.  </s>
<s> pls advice on what i need to do to solve this.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> notice step 1?  </s>
<s> the hard disk refuses to come on : it brings up a beep sound once i plug it in to the power source .. thanks for ur reply  </s>
<s> notice that it differs from what you are doing?  </s>
<s> it maybe a goner, but try: 1) remove from case and install into desktop system(may need adapter) 2) try another usb enclosure none of these work, then its done in. the hd has crashed, you need a recovery service if you deem the data that priceless.  </s>
<s> you can try what the link robert offered as well.  </s>
<s> but, you description is good.  </s>
<s> next time get you hands on velcro fasteners/strips, stick to hd case and desk area to prevent future mishaps.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy tada -----willy  </s>
