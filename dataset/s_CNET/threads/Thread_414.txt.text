hello my name is rab from the uk i got my nec nd-3500a a long long time ago it was intalled for me but i dont know alot about it or hardware for that matter.i use it alot for data backup and making recorded movies into dvds. i have never had a problem with buying dvd discs until now. for how long i have had this drive i have not noticed that not every dvd disc is compatible i guess it was just luck i was buying the right type all this time. anyway i got myself a pack of sony dvd-r 120min/4.7gb 16x/1x dvd discs to burn some stuff and the dvd dont work with my burning software nero 7 and ashampoo burning studio 6. i really dont understand why they dont work when i have used other brands but the same type of discs before like: emtec dvd-r 4.7gb 120min and datawrite 8x dvd-r 4.7gb. this has only made confusion on the quest to find out what discs to buy in the future. well the question to you nice people is: what type of dvd discs are compatible with my nec nd-3500a? e.g. dvd+r what is the difference between dvd-r and dvd+r? what are the ''good'' brand names of dvds? thanks for reading my topic.
a list of recommended media ...might give that a try. or perhaps cdrinfo.com. i have a nec3550a and used cdrs by imation and dvds by tdk successfully. vapcmd
thank you for the tips. by any chance would you have a link to recommended media? my aim here is to get my 3 questions answered hopefully. so if anyone would like to add on to this topic then please do.
i found out this: media/mode supported: dvd-rom, dvd-r, dvd-rw, dvd0+r, dvd+r9, dvd+rw, dvd-video, cd-rom, cd-rom xa, cd-audio, cd extra, cd text, cd-i ready, cd-bridge, photo-cd, video-cd, hybrid-cd which helps me alot but now i dont understand why my sony dvd-r discs are not working. so should i be using dvd-r or dvd+r? i found this site telling me recommended media:  dvd+r dl(double layer) media & brands! if anyone out there can recommended discs for nec nd-3500a please do. thank you.
nevermind i just find the old discs i used. thanks for the help i guess... cya
