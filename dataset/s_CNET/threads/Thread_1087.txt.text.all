<s> hi, i wanna get a usb tv turner that can turn my laptop into a hdtv.  </s>
<s> there are quite a lot of them at newegg.com, such as hauppauge, plextor.  </s>
<s> can anyone suggest what to buy?  </s>
<s> what is most important to me is that it has to enable subtitle, because i need to record some tv dramas and study american english through the subtitles.  </s>
<s> most of time i may use it with the cable tv signal, so the plug is what i concern.  </s>
<s> i notice that the plug is different between canada and the u.s. if i want to make it work for both places, what kind of adapter should i get? the portablity is also my concern because i travel.  </s>
<s> so i think usb models are better than those bigger ones.  </s>
<s> regarding the antenna, i heard people saying that the antenna that comes within the package is useless, or not very effective.  </s>
<s> i do have a old antenna that belong to my old analogue tv. the two sticks can stretch out very long.  </s>
<s> can it be of any help to get signals over the air while i am at travel?  </s>
<s> best!  </s>
<s> dong  </s>
<s> i'd stick with hauppauge.  </s>
<s> details are at the hauppauge web site so i will not duplicate that here and address other points in your question.  </s>
<s> &quot;i notice that the plug is different between canada and the u.s. if i want to make it work for both places, what kind of adapter should i get?&quot; you'll have to supply a little detail.  </s>
<s> i lived in vancouver, bc for over 8 years and the cable was via the same &quot;f type&quot; connection as i have here in boston, usa.  </s>
<s> as to the antenna.  </s>
<s> you must be thinking of the new hdtv antenna.  </s>
<s> just like old analog tv days better antennas do work better.  </s>
<s> since it's not the antenna's fault that you are too far away from the tv transmitter there is nothing to add here from me.  </s>
<s> i am encountering folk that were never told how over the air (ota) tv works.  </s>
<s> so they ask what could be taken as silly questions.  </s>
<s> your question is not silly at all.  </s>
<s> it only brings up that many expect this to all work even when in remote areas of the nt. bob  </s>
<s> thanks bob.  </s>
<s> i will probably get a hauppauge.  </s>
<s> but still i still need to know if it can activate the close captioning or not.  </s>
<s> as you mentioned the hauppauge website, i went there but cannot find an answer for this from faq. in terms of the plug, i think it was my mistake.  </s>
<s> there is no difference between la and toronto, as a friend told me.  </s>
<s> dong  </s>
<s> in short, the cards do this but not all &quot;players.&quot; bob  </s>
<s> thanks again bob.  </s>
<s> i am reading those threads and it is good to know that at least through some effort, some people can eventually get the cc.  </s>
