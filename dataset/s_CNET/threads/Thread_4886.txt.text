hey. i just finished customizing my computer on cyberpowerpc.com and was about to checkout when i realized they only ship to the states. does anyone know of a site like cyberpower pc for canadians? i want one that gives you complete customization options like cyberpower. thanx
[ul= ships to canada. they allow complete customozation of the system, but they're expensive as hell. there's also falcon northwest , but they're also very pricey. [url= computer custom builds pcs, and has good prices; i'm just not sure if they ship to canada.
monarch seems to be the only one is my price range, i will have to check if they ship to canada. anyone else know of any others?
hello, if you are in canada you can pick up our great system direct from newegg and tiger direct who services our neighbor to the north.
