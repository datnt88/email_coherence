i have a 5 yr old dell desktop that is ready to be replaced. i want an inexpensive replacement that will be able to handle all the basics (email, internet, quicken, etc.) plus some basic youtube video and picture editing. i won't be using it for gaming but i might want to be able to stream to my tv at some point. what are some suggestions? i'd really like to keep the total below $700 thanks!
will refurbs do?  4016&spetabstoretype=97
i have bought a few refurbished computer desktops at tiger, and they were gateways that have worked great, and i am still using them. they are easy to upgrade, and the cases are open, and clean. if i was going to buy one today, this is the one it would be.  there are many on there to choose from. when you click on desktop computers look to the left side menu, and click on refurbished. they always are getting new stock in, so check on it every so often. i recently added a 650 wt psu, and a ati 5770 card to a dx441x gateway. it had come with a 2400xt. now the audio plays to the tv with just a hdmi cable. also the appilian suite that i just bought for 79.00 online works great. copies videos from youtube without a hitch, well worth the money. for 500.00 usd that computer at tiger is hard to beat.
today all are 389 to 399, 6gb ram, and the usual stuff.
if you are only going to use it for email and internet and a few basic programs (no games or hd movies etc). try a compact desktop or net top. they sell for around 200-350 here in the uk which is about $300-$500. however, if you want to spend slightly more and have a pretty good spec pc. i have just custom built a pc with an amd athlon 2 quad core 2.6ghz and 4gb 800mhz ram for about 400 (~$600) minus hard drives and cd/dvd drives which i took from the old pc, because there is nothing wrong with them, and im guessing you could do the same (although you have to be careful because if they are ide, most modern motherboards only have one ide connector so you either have to buy an expensive sata-ide connector or try and find a motherboard with 2 ide connectors (unless you only have 2 drives, 1 ide cable has 2 other sockets on it), but i suspect you could buy a small hard drive and cd/dvd read/writer for about $100. if you find an external drive thats cheaper than an internal drive, you can usually open them up and find a standard 3.5&quot; hard drive or 5.25&quot; disk drive. i bought an external memorex cd/dvd burner and opened it up and found a standard 5.25&quot; drive with standard connectors.
this should do the trick:  microsoft windows 7 professional (64-bit)*** intel core 2 quad processor q8300 4gb ddr2 ram 500gb 7,200rpm hard drive supermulti 8x double layer dvdrw drive 8-in-1 media card reader intel graphics media accelerator 3100 10/100 network
my generic advice is to buy name-brand. i think $700 is more than enough for what you want, though streaming video to your tv might cost you extra.
