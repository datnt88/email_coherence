<s> it seems there is a very wide difference in opinion between cnet reviewers and and consumers regarding printers.  </s>
<s> i'm looking for a aio wireless for a new imac and once i access a review the opposite seems to be the case made by actual users which is confusing.  </s>
<s> anybody have any suggestions?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> jj  </s>
<s> i don't have an apple to compare to or answer questions but when i asked my fellow moderators something similar they gave a nod to the canon mx870.  </s>
<s> it's been nice and my only quibble is it's size.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yes bob i have a friend in town who uses the 870 with mac ,all he said was wow it does a great job but it is large.  </s>
<s> thanks. one thing i forgot to mention was wireless.  </s>
<s> so any suggestion based on that requirement would be appreciated jj  </s>
<s> is the easiest wifi printer i've ever used.  </s>
<s> i can't speak about the apple side of the wifi but it's very nice here.  </s>
<s> beware of wifi experts that hide the ssid, use mac filters or try to get by with wep! bob  </s>
<s> it is wireless and as i stated in a prior post i have a friend in town who uses one wirelessly with a mac and he told me it works very well.  </s>
<s> now that someone else noted the mx870 let me share one more thing.  </s>
<s> it has an automatic document feeder or adf.  </s>
<s> while it is only single sided it has worked very well and worth noting.  </s>
<s> be sure to have help to unpack or move the thing around as it is rather big but not bigger than my first pc.  </s>
