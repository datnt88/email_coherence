hey all, i recently got a good deal on 4gb (2 modules) of corsair ram which runs at a timing of 5-5-5-18 i believe. the current memory in my pc is crucial ballistix, 4gb (4x1gb sticks) and runs at 7-7-7-24. from what i've heard, i could run the two sticks of corsair with two extra sticks of crucial as long as i underclocked the faster memory to match the crucial... but my real questions is, is this worth it? or would 4gb of the lower timing memory perform better than an underclocked 6gb? thanks!
for sticks on the same memory bus, the speed is set to the lowest speed stick. however i've seen people fret endlessly about this. then we run some benchmarks and only there do we see the 0.1% difference. bob
so... are you saying it would be best to run the 4gb of faster ram, rather than 6gb of slower? thanks
on my kid's machine with just 2gb it runs games superbly. why going more than this is mostly a discussion about consumers being oversold. take the faster 4gb. bob
