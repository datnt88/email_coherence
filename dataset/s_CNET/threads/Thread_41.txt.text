i am replacing the power source on an hp computer. had to order the replacement and it has a 4-pin video connector and the computer has a 3-pin connection. can i buy an adapter to convert the connector to a 3-pin or do i need to return the power source. the power source is smaller in size than usual (thanks hp) and finding a replacement has not been easy. thanks for any info you may have. butch
why no model numbers in your post? here's the forum tip that isn't showing up it seems.
the computer is an hp pavilion 8533z the original power source is a delta electronics model dps 160gb a rev 00 hp p/n 0950-3623 the p9 (video?) connector is a 3-pin connector one green, 2 black wires the replacement is a micro atx 200w p4-12v model mps3atx20 the connector is a 4-pin connector- 2 yellow and 2 black wires. all other connectors appear to be the same
&quot;only choose the 4 pin unit if you have the 4 pin plug connected to something in your pc, otherwise you do not need it.&quot; there may be extra connections that are never used. you didn't reveal if the 3 pin is used on the old setup. sadly, i haven't found the service manual for that model, but did find the note and clue above. bob
what makes yourpower supply an atx 12 v. the 4 pin is the 12 volt power plug that many mobos use to power the cpu now. [older mobos used the 5 volts or 3.3 volt connector] it's a mobo issue not a cpu issue. a given cpu can be fed from the 4 pin 12 volt on a newer mobo and work without such a connector on a mobo not set up for that connector. had you plugged that in to the viseo card you would have fried video card for dinner. yellow wires are normally 12 volts [of course black wires are grounds / returns]. i might guess that the greeen is for 3.3 volts, however 3.3 volts is normally orange. the only green wire in the standard is the ps-on lead on pin 14 of the 20 pin connector or pin 16 of the 24 pin connector. check with hp before plugging anything in.
