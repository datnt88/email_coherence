hi, i am for sure getting the e8500 core 2 duo cpu, and later planning on getting a radeon 4890. the cpu is very nice but i'm wondering if it would bottleneck the card at all and if so, to what degree. i'm also planning on getting a new 750 watt psu at the same time as the card and my current system also has 4 gigs (only 3.3 usable from vista 32 bit) of 667 ram. any estimations would be appreciated, thanks in advance.
unless you're doing video editting or some 3d ray-tracing, the e8500 has plenty of compute power.
i agree with the previous poster. keep in mind that e8500 (3.16 ghz) can outperform many quad-cores in single and dual-threaded applications because of the higher processor frequency. good purchase! timwoodchip #ignite disclosure: timwoodchip is an intel employee and aspirational sponsor of tomorrow.
