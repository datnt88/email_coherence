<s> hello experts, i have a dell dimension xps t850r desktop (atx casing, piii, 887mhz,760mb ram, winxp).  </s>
<s> it is very slow machine now, and i was trying decide between upgrading it or buying a new one... since my budget is around $200.  </s>
<s> ifi bought a new motherbaord, ram and processor, will the new motherboard fit in the current casing or will there be any misalignment?  </s>
<s> which motherboard should i buy?  </s>
<s> i highly appreciate any advice!  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> use the pc for ??? vapcmd  </s>
<s> the current hard drive is 300 gb. the pc is for general purpose, e.g. browsing internet, data storage/backup, little bit of photoshop and word processing.  </s>
<s> also, since it is connected to the internet thru lan cable and not wireless, i use it to download large files, etc.  </s>
<s> this is your manual i don't see any extensions on the mother board it looks like a pretty straight forward atx mother board.  </s>
<s> you might want to write down it dimensions before you go shopping.  </s>
<s> just some general recommendations....get the most universal socket you can find so lots of processors fit it and try to find a board that also can run as many cpus as possible for your $$$$.  </s>
<s> if you up date the mb then you'll most likely have to set your own bios.  </s>
<s> keep this in mind.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't spend much on it.  </s>
<s> a new systems about $700.00 that's vista ready and has a dual core.  </s>
<s> if you shop hard you might get one for even less.  </s>
<s> there seem to be lots of deals around for mini towers right now, maybe somethings up?  </s>
<s> anyone heard anything?  </s>
<s> proprietary and do not accept 'clone or standard at and atx' peripherals.  </s>
<s> so bottomline, if you're going to upgrade, don't plan on reusing the dell case and psu.  </s>
<s> i'd optimize and try using the existing system until you save the $$ to buy or build a new one.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
