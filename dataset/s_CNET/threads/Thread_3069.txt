''although it's not really a computer or network question, i'd like to know what your subscribers think the best cordless phone is. i've had bad luck and the expensive sets don't seem to be any better than the cheap ones. they all wind up having static breaking in on my conversations. it's very annoying. i keep them charged up, should i be letting them run down? the only really good cordless phone set i have ever used belonged to a friend. it was a seimens. by the time i could afford to get it...i saved for quite a while...they were no longer available anywhere. phones with cords don't even seem to be much better. ''so, would you consider helping me out here? ''could you ask the readers what they think for me, please? ''or if you have some good info...i need some. ''thanks a million! ''kitty ichelson'' if this gets to you and you can give me some insight...brands, prices, ghz's, nothing seems to make a difference. except i never heard static on my friend's phone, the seimens and they can't be found anymore. do ham set interfer? cb radios? passing airplanes???? i can't figure it out. kitty
