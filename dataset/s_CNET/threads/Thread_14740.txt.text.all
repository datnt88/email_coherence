<s> i have an xbox 360 elite and unfortunately i also have a netgrear rangemax model # wnr834b v2 wireless router.  </s>
<s> my router isnt recognizing my 360.  </s>
<s> when i first bought the router the two worked fine.  </s>
<s> for some reason it stopped.  </s>
<s> i called microsoft and they tell me that its the router.  </s>
<s> i called netgear for tech support and im told that i have to pay for that support.  </s>
<s> im not.  </s>
<s> could anyone help me reconnect?  </s>
<s> pleeeaase!  </s>
<s> you didn't tell how you added wireless or wifi or the 360 to your network.  </s>
<s> i set my wireless connection to my xbox when i first purchased my netgear.  </s>
<s> i went through the set-up procedures that netgear provided.  </s>
<s> i have tried to look for some type of installed program offline helper but there isn't one.  </s>
<s> i never had to touch my wifi router to add my 360.  </s>
<s> but i did have to add a wifi client or wifi &quot;bridge&quot; to my 360 and configure that.  </s>
<s> for the official xbox 360 wifi thing there are screens on the 360 you go to, to set the wifi network you want to use, etc. i don't duplicate web content on that but here's a page about the official wifi thing -&gt; here's a video about setting that up -&gt; bob  </s>
