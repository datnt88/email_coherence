the number of failed installs of xp media center makes me ask if you are an os install &quot;guru.&quot; if not, be sure to ask newegg if they will help you get media center fully functional. bob
well if you not a gamer you don't need a gaming video card. bob is corect about xp mce, it is a joke. you will get better results with xp pro and 3rd party software. john
what other kind of software any suggestions oh and would i need the video card for tv tuner or should i use the one that comes with it?
to watch tv or record, you need a special card, either a combined videocard/tuner, or separate tuner. a good combined videocard/tuner would be the all-in-wonder ati x800xl or just the ati all in wonder. it should come with software when you buy the card. roger
