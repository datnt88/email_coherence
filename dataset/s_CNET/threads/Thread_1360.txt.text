i am trying to install a hitachi gd-2000 cd burner in a dell optiplex gx-260 running windows xp professional. it reads but wont burn. i believe my problem is a driver but im having problems getting (opening) it from the hitachi site (  ). please help!!!!
try cdburnerxp and see if that works. i have yet to find a xp driver for cdrw drives. bob
the hitachi gd-2000 is a dvd-cd player (2x-20x), not a burner.
