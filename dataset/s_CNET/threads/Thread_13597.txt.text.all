<s> trying to get it to run my backed up copy of ps2 games.  </s>
<s> that is my specs here is a stock set up any help would be nice  </s>
<s> but here's the gpu list i like.  </s>
<s> that 7750 should best the current gpu but be sure to check benchmarks.  </s>
<s> if you change the motherboard you are in for a lot more cost.  </s>
<s> power supply, os, etc. my added thought.  </s>
<s> unplug the modem if you don't use it.  </s>
<s> it's a few saved watts and you need every one of them.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> performance gpu.  </s>
<s> with only 250 watts...you're probably looking at an upgrade gpu and a psu.. vapcmd  </s>
<s> forgot to say i did upgrade psu to 500 watts.  </s>
<s> my video card didnt work without it.  </s>
<s> i think my nvida is cool i can play leage of legends in 60 frames.  </s>
<s> maybe just a new cpu.  </s>
<s> mines only 2 cores.  </s>
<s> also i had a brown out few weeks go my pc was acting funny so i factory reboot.  </s>
<s> it kinda got better.  </s>
<s> now oscially i get blue screens  </s>
<s> faster with faster cpus.  </s>
<s> usually it's just gpus and the gts 250 is way down the list of gpus in the gaming world.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> if you are using 1333 ram you might find the machine to be a tad faster if you remove the 2x1gb sticks.  </s>
<s> if you are not using 1333 ram you might want to head over to &quot;crucial&quot; and pick up a 2x4gb kit.  </s>
<s> remove all the sticks and fit in the kit. the gpu upgrade would be easiest ........just keep the psu in mind as you go up the list.  </s>
<s> cpu upgrade?........can be easy or it might turn into a nightmare.  </s>
<s> gpu......you have a middle of the pack unit.  </s>
<s> i'd leave that alone for now.  </s>
<s> cpu.......you have a very low end unit.  </s>
<s> that could use some work.  </s>
<s> ram.....i'll take a guess you have 6gb of low speed ram.  </s>
<s> if true.....that could use some work.  </s>
<s> only you know what the budget is and what your comfortable with doing.  </s>
<s> ram...50 bucks.  </s>
<s> cpu....100 bucks.  </s>
<s> if you swap the cpu it might be best to get the latest bios before the swap.  </s>
<s> is 5gb ?  </s>
<s> which 500 watt psu do you have ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
