help! suddenly, for some reason, my two lenovo laptops last week (one is windows xp and one is windows 7) couldn't find any wireless networks. when i click on &quot;view wireless networks&quot; all that comes up is the iban computer to computer network. i know the wireless network router is working as i can connect to it with my non 3g ipad. i also took both computers to work and couldn't connect to an open wireless router there. i am puzzled as to how to even begin troubleshooting.
the norton internet security has expired. i can't explain why symantec shuts the internet off when that happens. bob
thank you for your response. i uninstalled norton but the wi fi network still does not show up as an available network. any other ideas? i&quot;m thinking maybe i should do a system restore if someone can guide me in how to do that.
you click the orb, type in system restore and read how. bob
