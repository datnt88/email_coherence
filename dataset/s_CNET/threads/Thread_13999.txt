9941	2	290970	2748370	2748353	james denison	4/10/08 6:15 am	1.2078081e12	followup	yep, pulled the cpu and checked to be absolutely sure it was in correctly which with the guides is sort of hard to miss. i've tried it with no memory, 1 stick, 2 stick. i've tried it with cpu fan unplugged just to see if it would give a beep error since many mobos do now for that. seems controller chips work on the mobo, but nothing from bios is, like the bios is dead. i sent in another rma request with mention of the earlier filing for one.

9941	6	290970	2756690	2748236	james denison	4/21/08 10:10 pm	1.2088158e12	rma was done, replacement came, same problem.	seems there may be a problem with 780g type motherboards.   i've sent some questions to gigabyte, hoping for an answer soon. i'm wondering if the motherboard needs mounting in the case so that can provide a grounding plane for it. the screw points have contacts at them, and wondering if maybe those need the screws to there to complete some of the circuits. if so that would be a first to me, but about ready to entertain any such strange ideas. same test setup, same problem. this time i bench tested it on top of it's own box. hooked onboard vga to monitor, plugged in a ps/2 standard keyboard, installed athlon 64x2 4200 using 65w power with it's approved hsf plugged to motherboard. put in one stick of memory in slot 1. hooked up 575w psu to both the 24 pin and the 4 pin plugs on mobo. short across the power pins and psu turns on, cpu's fan runs and still no post, no video to the monitor. i've tried a pci card for video, swapped memory chips (different speed and maker!). only thing i've not changed between both boards was trying a different cpu. i've shorted the cmos pins, i even removed the battery and shorted across those terminals for awhile to make sure cmos chip would reset the bios. nothing seems to work. there's never been any heat detected from the cpu area, but then it's not been accessed either since it won't post. i wanted this board for the solid capacitors, but right now i'd welcome the riskier electrolytic main capacitors just to have a motherboard that will benchtest easy and provide the gaming experience i know my youngest would appreciate. right now i'm facing getting a different motherboard (probably a biostar) that will take the memory and processor i have and then mess around with gigabyte on getting something that works, since i've already done an rma with the vendor and not anxious to go that route again. daughter's birthday is in a month and i want to finish it up now, not be left hanging on it till then.

9941	8	290970	2756798	2756793	james denison	4/22/08 5:36 am	1.20884256e12	no memory?	that's basically it, except since i was looking for boot display to monitor i had that hooked up to the onboard vga and a stick of memory in it. i didn't get any beeps of any sort on the first motherboard. of course i was hoping to get at least one, indicating all was well. i didn't try the speaker yesterday on the other motherboard, but will, however i suspect i still won't get any beeps. in fact i'll pull the known good speaker off one of my other systems to use instead, just to be sure. i'd hate to think the vendor is swapping rma boards between those who sent them in, i'd hope that's not the case, but seems strange i would get two &quot;new&quot; boards that were doa. this is unusual for me, not had two boards in a row of same make act doa.
9941	9	290970	2757113	2756793	james denison	4/22/08 4:28 pm	1.20888168e12	fixed	knowing all parts other than the cpu had been tested and ok, and absolutely no beeps, ever, i pulled the cpu again and put it under the big magnifying glass. let me say i hate these am2 and 939 pin processors, too many pins in too small a space and too thin. it makes you appreciate the socket a cpu's much better. two pins were bent on the cpu, one near the marked corner a row back both ways and one on the exact opposite corner. those pins are so close and so small i could barely see them even with my reading glasses and looking through the glass, but did manage to try some different size safety pins till i found one that would fit exactly between the pins width and was able to &quot;comb&quot; the 2 bent pins back up fairly decent. it was enough to get them all into the socket ok with some very gentle wiggle action. did the post and boot up fine now to my thumbdrive, even with both sticks of the kingston hyperx memory installed (2 g's total). even with a magnifier i almost didn't see that second pin that was bent, and the first worst bent one wasn't that easy to find either. that's after sighting down the rows from both sides, and it was the wrong glint of light that helped me find it. i don't know if i bent them the first install, or if it was damaged in shipping. at least it's done and i can move on from it.

9941	11	290970	2757397	2757390	james denison	4/23/08 6:33 am	1.20893238e12	yes, you did.	i was expecting to hear the &quot;siren&quot; type of beeps if the cpu had a problem instead of hearing nothing. when you mentioned hearing nothing along with my previous testing of other items, i realized it almost certainly had to be a processor problem. what's your opinion on amd's using such weak pins on these 939 pin processors? they are so close together though i don't think they could make them too much thicker and still have a socket that could take them. are you finding them difficult to get properly installed? the 754 and down have never presented any problem for installation to me. i'd rather have these newer processors mounted on a circuit board with bigger, stronger pins to fit in a bigger socket. if they did that they could still go super nano on the processor itself but make it easier for those who install them.
