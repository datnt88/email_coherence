i have been looking at netbooks and reading reviews for some time. the service reports regarding dell are so negative, i am looking away from dell though the vostroa90 netbook seemed good. the asus has gotten very good reviews. can someone give feedback and how does asus compare with acer? also, asus is offered at bestbuy for only 299, a good price, yet best buy also has a bad reputation for service, would it be better to buy a netbook directly from manufacturer? thanks, cathy
i own the acer 8.9 inch 160gb model and it's fine here. now the only issues i'm seeing are people that don't want to get some usb dvdrw drive to make the restore media and those that think support includes software issues. beyond that i like all the netbooks i've used. one last thing. all the people that got these to replace a laptop are getting very cranky. bob
i just read a report on repair rates, and the asus looks really good in that regard. re: best buy and service on a netbook it's not like you need much done with it, save on shipping and easy return if yours falls in the small percent that is defective. compared to dell.com or similar outlets, i like best buy better than zero service from a call-center in india.
