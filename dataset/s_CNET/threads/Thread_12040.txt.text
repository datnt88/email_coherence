one day i decided to go off to the store and buy dvds to burn some of my files, when i cameback home my computer was running yet there was no display no nuttin on my monitor it was as if everything froze, the power button didnt work either. so i disconnected it. reconnected it and got a eeeee sound as if the computer wasnt feeling the power, like a car wanting to turn on but it wont. i thought it was the psu, i just bought one today and installed it, i connect it, and i kear the same eeeee sound, the sound i think comes from the psus ( not 100% sure but pretty certain) and i know that the spus is not to blame. i wanted to know what could be the problem? motherboard died? or in worse case scenario, cpu died?
start unpluggin items from the motherboard. i try 2 at a time until i'm down to motherboard, cpu/heasink/fan, power supply and the little speaker. if those last items don't beep in protest i know it's one of those. bob
i had a similar problem which i solved by unplugging the computer, pressing the power button, removing the silver cmos battery inside the computer then reinstalling the battery. everything then started up fine. not sure why this worked but it did. my thought was to clear the cmos and start over with fresh cmos settings.
is the sound a screeching sound? if so, it could be the hard drive has failed. disconnect the power to the hard drive and try to start with either a boot floppy or windows cd. just to see if you get a reaction. if you can boot to a ''dos'' prompt from either, the hard drive is fried.
