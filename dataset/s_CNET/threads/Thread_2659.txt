14290	29	265955	2595503	2594624	waarnold	9/29/07 2:00 pm	1.1910744e12	which drive is best?	the answer obviously is varied. however, i started computer operating in early 60's, programming in mid 60's, in 70's started repairing them, in 80's started building them, so, have a little experience in that line. my personal uses are, early days was seagate and they went down hill and went to micropolis (they were good drives), tried fujitsu and didn't like them, went to western digital and had too many failures. went to maxtor and have stuck with maxtor since the latter 80's. however, maxtor runs in cycles of lasting a good while and then failures frequently. i have recently gone to seagate again. however, bought two 120 gigers at the same time, one started scrambling things in about 6 months. the other currently is ok after two years. thought i'd try hitachi and that is the first i ever had dead out of the box so wont try them again. will most likely stick to seagate even if they are slower ie., ata-100 instead of 133, however i think that is changing in the sata side as the one i just bought has 3g capability. long story short, they seem to run in cycles for brand failure rate. and, for those that have the old drives, i find they get so slow you can't tolerate them and buy another, however, we can say the work, but not acceptable. they haven't failed as yet, we just throw them away.

( hitachi is known for failures). yet another thorn in the side of the consumer! i should mention that their scsi line of drives is a good product still. 3. fujitsu (desktop drives only) their 10, 15, 20 and 30gb desktop models have been failing left and right with either servo loss or electronic failure. notebook drives are only so-so but are no longer manufactured. they have had so many returned drives, that they have stopped making drives all together. 4. maxtor (we are seeing more and more of these as failed) see below. you get what you pay for. do not use these in server or business applications! if you do, keep them backed up like there is no tomorrow! these are consumer drives only! 5. toshiba (notebook drives only). good engineering! generally good all the way around, but can develop bad heads in some models. as always, just keep it backed up. 6. quantum. has had a bad batch of drives with a defective chip incl. the fireball cx,la,lb,lc and kx series. maxtor now owns quantum (got them at a good price too!). we have been seeing a large number of the quantum asxxxx series drives come in with missing outer servo, especially the 40gb drives, similar to the problem fujitsu has. this is an unrecoverable situation! beware. 8. samsung also known as trigem in e-machines (inexpensive, you get what you pay for!) cheaply made, consumer use only but do a religious backup! 7. western digital (they still haven't learned, their drives are still failing left and right). cheaply made. especially the 'eb' series. the 20gb ab and eb series are horrible. again, i urge you not to use these in business applications. these have servo problems too which are starting to surface. worst models ever: 1 being worst 1. western digital ac1xxx, ac2xxx and ac3xxx series except ac31000 (prone to severe head crash). 2. quantum bigfoot series (any model) prone to many severe failures. cheap drives that never should have been made. these were used heavily by compaq, to keep their costs down! 3. quantum fireball cx,cr,la,lb,lc,kx all have defective spin chips and will fail without warning! quantum was bought by maxtor 07-01. 4. conner cfs850a and cfs1275a (some of the most rma'd drives of all time). 5. hitachi notebook drives of any kind (almost always head crash or lose servo or suffer from misalignment) don't use them! if you have to, backup! used exclusively (because they got a good deal) by dell! if you order a dell, request a different drive or go elsewhere. 6. fujitsu notebook drives of any kind are prone to head crash, desktop drives are bad now too, sorry. again, they have stopped making drives and now barely support what is left out there. 7. samsung drives of any kind (either head crash, or stiction (heads stick to the platters)) cheaply manufactured. 8. toshiba mk2103mav and mk2101man 2.5&quot; drives (prone to severe head crash, heavily rma'd) 9. nec drives of any kind (poor engineering causes many failures, no longer making desktop drives) 10. jts any model (prone to head crash, cheap drives, now out of business) 11. maxtor 7850, 71336, 71260, 72004 (all had defective head stops, heads fly off platters and break off) 12. maxtor 10gb, 20gb, 30gb any model are crashing at an alarming rate! severe electrical problems as well. these are consumer drives at best. back them up now! do not use for business applications. 13. seagate elite 9gb scsi (poor engineering promotes severe head crash). 14. seagate 32140a (prone to severe head crash, heavily rma'd drive). 15. seagate 5xxx series (prone to head crash and or broken head wires). 16. micropolis (almost always head crash, what else is new? they have been out of business now for 5 years). mark cooper president drive service company the data recovery specialists! e-mail: mark@driveservice.com

14290	53	265955	2604257	2595443	solitairedaxel	10/11/07 12:34 pm	1.19210604e12	yeah...	i was wondering why windows had started putting out different versions for different hard drives...(and when!) i have no idea which version of windows is worst, having only used three versions. as far as the hard drives go, i have an internal western digital that has been okay and an external seagate that has also been okay. however, from the reviews i read, i would be inclined to go with seagate if given an option (it seems to stand up to general wear and tear slightly better than other brands).

14290	57	265955	2651168	2650551	randysvh	12/10/07 6:01 pm	1.19730966e12	data recovery	data is very important and i sure understand your situation greatly. in the past i have felt good about wd drives, but in recent years they have lost their touch. in the beginning when i was working with 10mb drives i liked seagate and then they had their share of problems and some were good and others were, well not so good. maxtor in the early days were super drives, but when they bought out miniscribe and took on a new series of designs and were poor for a long time. each brand has had their ups and downs. right now i feel that seagate is the one to choose and a strong choice for reliability. i have some maxtors, westerndigitals, and seagates. right now i am cautious with them all. i do data recovery when it comes about and it is time consuming to do and try to keep the costs down for the individual who wants to keep their files that they have worked so hard to save and develop over a period of time. personally i charge a fee usually from $200-300 in most situations to recover your data. even with the programs available today, there is no way to guarantee the data can or will be recovered. i certainly wish i could have helped you, as i know the feeling when it comes to your data, having lost data of my own, just so happens on a wd. seagate right now may be the choice in hds today for reliability. tomorrow, who knows what might be the right choice. whatever you do save your data on multiple platforms or media. randy

14290	59	265955	2651300	2651250	randysvh	12/10/07 11:10 pm	1.1973282e12	backup media	cd and dvd media is a good way to keep backups. depending on the type of data and whether it is personal or business. for small amounts of data and less critical data cd and dvd media will work fine. for more business like situations, tape backups are still the way to back up systems. with the cost of huge capacity hds now days it is relatively inexpensive to create a raid array of hd that can provide an excellent form of backup and protection. redundant hd systems work well too. what you are willing to do and what you are willing to invest in your data will help you determine the backup system you choose. randy
