<s> thx  </s>
<s> if your os is xp, then that's it, 2.2gb limit.  </s>
<s> there is nothing you can do and even if so, it would be another cost and hassle.  </s>
<s> only the newer mtrbds.  </s>
<s> and vista and later os(64-bit) will work as clean as possible.  </s>
<s> visit the seagate support website and review it's faq.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
