<s> plz help!!!!!! qomarf ps: pc config- 1.8 ghz p4, 512 ram, windows xp pro sp2  </s>
<s> you could have a weak or failing psu(power supply) or the infamous bad caps on mtrbd.. google(for example) for bad caps, but inspect the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> for leaking, distorted or bulging caps(capacitors).  </s>
<s> since, you have a 1.8mhz system that suggests you had it for awhile as that's dated and/or been around.  </s>
<s> in that time the psu has aged and possibly on its last legs. the bad caps is known problem from bad manufacture of caps.  </s>
<s> in either case, replace, i suggest the psu, first unless you see bad caps.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> hopefully i wud b able to use the information....i changed my psu 6 months bak...do u think changing it again wud help?? can u plz provide me some more info on bad caps (y do this happen n wut r the remedies)...do i needta chnge my mtrbrd??  </s>
<s> take out that new psu and put back in the old one.  </s>
<s> does the same thing happen?  </s>
<s> my old psu gt completely busted...it gt burnt quite bad 6 months ago..i dnt thnk i can get tht bak.  </s>
<s> sine you mentioned you replaced the old psu 6mos.  </s>
<s> ago you maybe experiencing a 2ndary problem. the final act of a dying system.  </s>
<s> i can't guarantee the new psu will fix it, it's just a course of action to take when the system won't power-on.  </s>
<s> all too often when a burnt psu as you say, it could very well weaken or stress or outright take another compoment or device with it, if not now, later.  </s>
<s> try: for examples.  </s>
<s> yes, a bad caps situation can be corrected, but only if you're capable and/or allow a local source to fix it.  </s>
<s> if outside repair, it maybe more practical to just buy another mtrbd.. for money better spend.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
