i am wondering why a document that displays colored graphics when viewed in wp and ms word, only prints up black/white. the printer can print other docs that are colored w/o a problem. i am assuming that some property of the document itself has been configured to print in greyscale, but i wasn't able to find any such option.
normally, it's a setting on the print dialog window. that's stored in the document, but easy to change for a new print job. if not, try copy all/paste to a new document (based on the same template). kees
printer dialaog properties and copying/pasting. still all in black and white. oh well...thanks anyways.
