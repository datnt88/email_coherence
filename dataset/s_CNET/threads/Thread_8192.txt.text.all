<s> i was just about to buy a monochrome laser printer when i read a review that you need to replace the laser printer's cartridge or drum or something every 3 toners, and each cartridge costs just as much as the laser printer. is this true?  </s>
<s> i need advice on buying a printer to be used when i'm at a university.  </s>
<s> honestly, i only need black ink, and there will be months when i won't use it since i will be on break.  </s>
<s> how much maintenance comes with laser printers in comparison to inkjet printers?  </s>
<s> how long do they last?  </s>
<s> thanks, and sorry for so many questions, it's just so hard to pick.  </s>
<s> do some research on toner cartridge cost and availability before you buy one.  </s>
<s> sounds to me as if you just need something basic. the brother 2140 would probably work, they are inexpensive and functional and the toner cost won't break you.  </s>
<s> rule of thumb on a toner cartridge (mono) is something over 2000 copies but it can vary depending upon the unit.  </s>
<s> some manufacturers offer two variations of toner cartridges, basic and full, quantity of toner in cartridge and the cost will reflect that.  </s>
<s> if you do a color laser the story changes they will be considerably more expensive to operate, especially if you have to replace a drum.  </s>
<s> some brands of laser printers (such as hp) incorporate the drum with the toner cartridge.  </s>
<s> depending on the machine and type of cartridge it uses, you'll get anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 pages (monochrome) of normal text coverage on the average page.  </s>
<s> you can then either buy a new cartridge -- typically costing $60 to $90, but with some outliers much more costly -- or you can re-fill the cartridge.  </s>
<s> several firms on the internet sell refill kits.  </s>
<s> we use products from tonerrefillkits.com, but i'm sure there are other reputable suppliers you can choose from.  </s>
<s> some printers, however, separate their toner cartridges from the drums.  </s>
<s> brother does this.  </s>
<s> we haven't noticed that the brother toner cartridges are any cheaper than hp's, but after you've run 3-5 through the machine, the drum starts wearing out.  </s>
<s> and -- surprise, surprise -- a replacement drum costs $180 to $250.  </s>
<s> yep, that's more than we paid for the machine.  </s>
<s> so while the brother machines tend to be cheaper to start with, they can become extremely more expensive.  </s>
