i'm planning on buying a new laptop soon since my current hp zt3000's monitor does not work properly (works 1/50 times the laptop is turned on) so it's constantly hooked to an external and... well, no longer a laptop (costs around $600 to have it fixed by buying a new motherboard). i remember when i bought a desktop 6 years ago i went with an amd because they were generally cheaper than the pentiums, and performance-wise they were almost the same. with all this new intel dual-core, inter core duo and amd dual-core, i'm kinda lost now. what's the best option out there?
what metric do you use to determine &quot;best&quot;? if it is performance then the core 2 duo would be the winner while if it is bang for the buck then it may vary a bit. i would suggest a dual core laptop, e.g. intel core duo, core 2 duo(which is the successor to core duo) or amd turion 64 x2, if you do any cpu-intensive tasks. i would likely stay away from celeron or sempron laptops unless you don't mind having a low power processor as these are for low-end systems which isn't the same as saying they use less electricity. regards, jb
definitely go with a dual core laptop. there are 3 main flavors: intel core duo, intel core 2 duo, and amd turion 64 x2. sometimes you'll see &quot;pentium dual core&quot; which is really a core duo. the turion 64 x2s are about as fast as a core duo at the same processor speed (ghz); core 2 duo is about 12% faster at the same processor speed.
