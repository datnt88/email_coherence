<s> hello, i recently purchased an old hpe-210y desktop with the ati radeon hd5450 graphics card installed.  </s>
<s> i would like to have a large screen display for the desktop, but i want it to be clear and to fit proportionality on the monitor screen.  </s>
<s> i am currently considering buying a 29 inch lcd monitor display or a 32 inch led 720p television.  </s>
<s> i was hoping someone on this forum could provide me with guidance as to which purchase would be a better option.  </s>
<s> i do not play video games, but i do watch a lot of you tube videos and surf the net. the desktop also has a blue ray player.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> here is the link to the hp website that contains the computer specifications.  </s>
<s> lcd is generally regarded as ccfl back lit lcd where as led lcd means that leds back light the lcd.  </s>
<s> oled is your true led system but you know that.  </s>
<s> skip/ignore 720p for now and there is little to zero difference when it comes to led/ccfl &quot;clarity&quot;.  </s>
<s> clarity is all about the lcd panel and possibly the protective cover (gloss = clarity but you know the drawbacks.) bob  </s>
<s> the better tvs are going to have the resolution you want.  </s>
<s> as for brands and what model and all that, you're left with buying better tv as in better than 720, that's old stuff now.  </s>
<s> i suggest anything that starts better than 720 is going to provide what you need. the 5450 video ports should offer both hdmi and svga/dvi or all, just be sure that it connects w/o any!!!! adapter to make this a better match.  </s>
<s> i also find you will need to tell the tv where the media stream is coming from but that goes with any tv in most respects.  </s>
<s> last, you may want a huge tv, but most 32in.  </s>
<s> will do the job fine imho.  </s>
<s> once you get beyond 32in.  </s>
<s> you maybe pushing it unless you have true hi-end video components, etc.. it may display and all, but for how long and/or sustain it all.  </s>
<s> of course, just buy the true pc monitor, but those tvs really make a great display.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
