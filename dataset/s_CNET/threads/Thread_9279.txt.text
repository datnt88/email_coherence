i am wondering of what projector would be good to have for my laptop. i need a projector that is small and runs off a battery. i don't want an adapter of vga to anything.
&quot;i don't want an adapter of vga to anything.&quot; since you don't allow the adapter or use of vga to anything then how would you propose the video from the laptop get to the projector? bob
i meant that i did not want to get an adapter that would go on the vga connector of my computer to something like composite or component. i hope this clarifies my question.
maybe there are others but here's a vga battery powered unit.
