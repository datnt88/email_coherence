<s> hello folks, i am looking into buying a media center desktop.  </s>
<s> i have looked at some of the larger commercial companies as well as smaller ones like velocity micro.  </s>
<s> i would like the following in my pc:&lt;div&gt;i7 processor blu-ray drive (dont need to write blu-ray, combo with dvd-r preferred) decent 1-2 gb video card that supports hdmi upmarket sound card (3 mm ok, rca preferred) tv tuner (not as familiar with these, but hdmi compatibility is a must) 1 tb hd or better bluetooth compatibility on the wireless card my budget is between $1000-1500.  </s>
<s> i am a bit overwhelmed by the options available these days not to mention the company websites are so-so at describing the options available on customization.  </s>
<s> i primarily want to hook this pc up to my lcd tv and use it as a conduit for tv, music and streaming media.  </s>
<s> also, reliability of the product is important.  </s>
<s> i was interested in vm initially but some of the reviews i had read were not so supportive.  </s>
<s> i like the smaller brands due to the lack of bs software that comes pre-loaded with them.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for the advice!  </s>
<s> &lt;/div&gt;  </s>
<s> odd idea.  </s>
<s> i wonder how folk know why this is overkill for 99.99% of us.  </s>
<s> 2 gb would be at the extreme end and not necessary.  </s>
<s> i also like to get a lot of years out of my desktops by getting lots of memory.  </s>
<s> i have been using a desktop from 2004 until recently because i got it with, at the time, overkill ram and video.  </s>
<s> i also do game from time to time, especially the total war series with large unit numbers, which eats up memory.  </s>
<s> some are miffed over the state of affairs in tv cards.  </s>
<s> for example, no more cable cards and cable companies moving to all digital encrypted content.  </s>
<s> at least these cards are $$ and not $$$.  </s>
<s> in your case, you lead off with a post that gives all the signs you should build it yourself.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i think the custom built will be the best option.  </s>
<s> im going to leave out the tv card and go with a slingbox if i want the tv through the cpu  </s>
