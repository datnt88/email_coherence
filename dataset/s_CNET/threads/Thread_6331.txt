8749	2	279481	2676535	2676487	cheesuscrust	1/11/08 10:07 am	1.20004602e12	os is xp	the os is xp. why would you skip the 8 series line? is it compatible? are you saying i'm not going to maximize the utility of the 8 series so i might as well get the 7 series? thanks for your help

8749	4	279481	2676604	2676566	cheesuscrust	1/11/08 11:40 am	1.2000516e12	sorry, still a little unsure about compatibility	just to set my mind at ease, the 7 series and the 8 series nvidia cards are all compatible with the motherboard?

8749	6	279481	2676635	2676611	cheesuscrust	1/11/08 12:05 pm	1.2000531e12	thanks	ok, so having the proper expansion slot is only part of the compatibility concern. i see your point too regarding the 7 series. i have a little extra money, so i don't mind paying in the 200-250 range, was thinking that when i do get a newer computer, i would be able to transfer the card i buy now into the newer one. was looking around in shops near me and unfortunately not many carry the 7xxx's that would be better than the 8600 gts (which is the card i was originally going for). hence i guess i'll probably get the 8600gts. anyway, thanks for your help.

8749	10	279481	2679494	2679300	cheesuscrust	1/15/08 12:38 am	1.20035748e12	roger	yea, i haven't bought or done anything, was almost thinking it too good to be true that the pcix16 cards would fit since the apg slot is only 4x, as apposed to 8x. i guess the card range i'm looking at now probably has little difference in price, so i'm just going to have to try to find the best one compatible with my computer. i think i'll head over to a store and talk with one of the chaps there.
8749	11	279481	2679510	2679494	cheesuscrust	1/15/08 12:48 am	1.20035808e12	one more thing ...	ok, now that i'm set on agp, the question arises of power supply. so if i purchase one of the better 8x agp cards, i'll probably want to purchase a better power supply, which to me, at the moment, seems like it shouldn't be a problem. i'm sure i could handle replacing the power supply. question: do i have to consider other compatibility issues with the replaced power supply, or is this an easy replacement? for example, with a new power supply, will 'component xyz' now have issues? something in this nature, thanks again.
