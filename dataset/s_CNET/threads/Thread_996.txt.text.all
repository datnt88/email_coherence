connect a lt to dsl with a pc winme dsl linksys-wireless g-214 i have a pc connected to the internet with dsl which works fine. 
for father's day my son bought me a laptop which i also want to connect to the internet along with my pc. i tried to connect my lt to the internet using my liinksys, but i just can't do it using my dsl modem and my linksys. 
please explain to me in simple language how i can connect my lt to the internet along with my pc? thanks 
what kind of internet service you have. 
dsl or cable by what company. 
you don't say what model your lt is, but i assume it has a network plug-in, you may also need to make a change in the bios to initialize the network connection, but if there is no option in the bios you may have to set up a new network connection in windows. 
also are you testing the connection from the linksys with the same cable as with your pc? if you are using a separate cable you can check if that is okay, by substituting it with the cable you use for the pc. 
i have a dsl ...a wirespeed westell modem, n a linksys router
