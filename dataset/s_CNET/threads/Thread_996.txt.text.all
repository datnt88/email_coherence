<s> for father's day my son bought me a laptop which i also want to connect to the internet along with my pc. i tried to connect my lt to the internet using my liinksys, but i just can't do it using my dsl modem and my linksys.  </s>
<s> please explain to me in simple language how i can connect my lt to the internet along with my pc? thanks  </s>
<s> what kind of internet service you have.  </s>
<s> dsl or cable by what company.  </s>
<s> you don't say what model your lt is, but i assume it has a network plug-in, you may also need to make a change in the bios to initialize the network connection, but if there is no option in the bios you may have to set up a new network connection in windows.  </s>
<s> also are you testing the connection from the linksys with the same cable as with your pc? if you are using a separate cable you can check if that is okay, by substituting it with the cable you use for the pc.  </s>
<s> i have a dsl ...a wirespeed westell modem, n a linksys router  </s>
