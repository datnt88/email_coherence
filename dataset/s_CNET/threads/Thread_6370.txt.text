i looked into the ipad. i like their applications, but i also wanted to be able to download my library books to the ipad. when i checked with the public library, they stated that the ipad is an incompatible device because: &quot;drm-protected adobe epub & pdf ebooks are incompatible with these devices&quot; does anyone know if or how this issue is being dealt with?
that's apple's policy. no change expected.  kees
thanks for the info.
catch me up here: so the ipad epub app can't read libaray epub format books becasue the expiry process uses drm? bummer, the universality of all the apps was one of the deciding factors pushing me towards the ipad..
