well, it's been awhile since i've upgraded my video card (i have a sapphire ati 8500le, agp, 250/400, 128mb). i just bought battlefield 2, and found out i really need to. normally, i'm diehard ati, but i've been looking at nvidia's latest stuff and it doesn't look half bad. so, basically, i'm looking for the best card for $100-200, ati or nvidia. i will be using it just about exclusivley for gaming (see battlefield 2 for screenshots). now, i don't have pci express, but if there's a great card that has to have it, my motherboard's getting old and could be replaced too. thanks in advance guys. p.s. motherboard can support agp 4x/8x and regular pci. also, sorry if this has been asked before, i really didn't want to search the whole forum.
cost 200 bucks at newegg.
man you will need an upgrade. bf2 is one of the most demanding pc games on your graphics card and also ram. (i have the game) well for ati, at least a 9600 or 9800 pro. nvidia, the requirements are steep, ea recomends at least a 5700 or greater so i would go at least a 6600gt or 6800 you might have to upgrade your power supply if you choose the 6800  thats the 6800  6600gt  9800 pro those are all great cards. konny
looks like i can get a refurb ati x800 series for around 150-200, how about them? i'd have to upgrade my motherboard, but it kind of could use it anyways.
pretty much any x800 series video card performs well. the x800 series is stable btw and runs cooler than the 6800s. konny
