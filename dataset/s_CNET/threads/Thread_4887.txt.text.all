<s> anyone have any suggestions for third party web sites offering tech support on adobe (fka macromedia) flash player?  </s>
<s> adobe/macromedia support is non-existant and flash player no longer works on my pc. all i have are blacked out boxes where flash content should be playing and internet explorer's manage add-ons indicates the flash player active-x control is enabled.  </s>
<s> i have recently gotten rid of norton systemworks and a combo pop-up/ad blocker software and have searched and removed possible kill-bit entries in the registry, all to no avail.  </s>
<s> any suggestions appreciated.  </s>
<s> but the posting member should supply all details (what os?) and post in the forum for their os. all the other places such as geeksquad will cost some money, but if that's what you want.  </s>
