just got my macbook and i'm wondering if a noise in my superdrive is normal. so when i load a cd or dvd it sounds like the gears are working but there is also this sound like something is knocking up against the insides of the laptop. is this normal?
i'll write yes, its fine. however if you had said it makes that sort of noise after the load is done i would tell you to listen to an unit at the store. bob
thanks i'll do that
