i found an old computer in my basement and opened it up. i took the processor out and it says its an itel dx4 processor. is this worth any still?
of that series the dx4. then came the 586's later named pentium due to a court ruling, the 686's were also named pentium, further versions still called some version of a pentium.. might be something a collector would want. if the system works someone might still use it as a word processor or such.
i've found these cpus for a buck. strictly a collector's item today. bob
