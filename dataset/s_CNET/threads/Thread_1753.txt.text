hi, i was thinking about getting a new laptop, mine is 5 years old: dell 600m, pentium m 1400 mhz, 512mb ram, windows xp sp3. but... i ran my roomates laptop: windows vista, 2gb ram, athalon 2.1ghz i tested a macro in excel, a c++ and vb.net application and the results were.. excel was slower on the new laptop. also vb.net and c++ applications were only 13% faster. so it doesnt seem like upgrading is really worth it. only a benefit of 13% on speed? some reason excel was slower. my question - i wanted to upgrade the ram on my laptop. at dell.com there was only the option for 1gb of ram and the specs were... type dram technology ddr sdram form factor so dimm 200-pin memory speed 333 mhz ( pc2700 ) module configuration 128 x 64 1. can i use any ram? i wanted to have 2gb but dell only has 1gb available. 2. if i buy 1gb of ram can i just add this or would i need to remove the 512mb ram already installed? thanks for your input.
did you check crucial.com to see what ram is available?
oh yeah i just checked and there is only 1 type available. i thought you could use any ram. do you know if it is a problem adding 1gb to 512mb exhisting or do i have to replace the 512mb. i have 1 of 2 slots filled with 512mb currently.
it's why i just get it from crucial for many machines. i have xp on a few machines with 512mb and a few with 1gb. one xp machine has 2gb but i can't say it's any faster as to computations due to the ram. bob ps. i have a simple, cheap dv6910us that i run vs2008 on. i have this crc routine that does some 4 billion crcs in a little over 3 minutes. i'm impressed.
then you'll have 1.5gb total. follow the installation instructions carefully...unplug from ac power and remove laptop battery before installing the ram. if possible, i'd put the 1gb sodimm in the first slot and the old 512mb sodimm in the 2nd slot.  let us know how it works. vapcmd
