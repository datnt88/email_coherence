<s> hey, i just installed the ati theater 550 pro tv tuner card, and i want to play my ps2 on it.  </s>
<s> however, i can't seem to find a way how to play it.  </s>
<s> so i have a few questions: first, how do i go to the ps2 in the first place?  </s>
<s> do i access it from tv? is there supposed to be a special channel?  </s>
<s> second, i don't have a cable or tv antenna connected; do i need to have one connected to play the ps2?  </s>
<s> third, i have windows sp1.  </s>
<s> do i really need sp2 to play on the ps2?  </s>
<s> the outputs on ps2 are??? rf??? video????how did you hook your ps2 to your tv???? so lets say rf set ps2 to channel 3, connect a rf cable from the ps2 rf out to channel 3 the ati tuner input and tune it to channel 3. john  </s>
<s> how do i set the rf? i'm a little confused by what you're suggesting.  </s>
