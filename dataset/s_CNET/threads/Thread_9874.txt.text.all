<s> i recently hooked up an external monitor to my asus laptop (running windows 7) and it's now going to sleep at times as i'm working on word, viewing a video, or without me doing anything.  </s>
<s> i've changed the power settings, had the pc checked out at the shop, switched out the monitor and the power chord, and it will still go to sleep.  </s>
<s> it usually does it with several programs running (quickbooks, firefox, word, outlook, itunes) at a time and late at night after it's been running all day.  </s>
<s> it often does it when i'm streaming video.  </s>
<s> i added ram to it and that didn't help either.  </s>
<s> (it never goes to sleep like this if i'm using the laptop's monitor only.) here are its specs: the chip type: mobile intel (r) 4 series express chipset family adapter string: mobile intel (r) gma 4500 m total available graphics memory: 1326 mb dedicated video memory: 64 mb system video memory: 0 mb shared system memory: 1262 mb last night just before it went to sleep i noticed i could hear the fan running and it sounded like it was working pretty hard.  </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> i can't find the exact model but i'm finding many folk reporting &quot;it's going to sleep&quot; because the monitor shows such a message.  </s>
<s> what's really happening is the laptop shut down and the monitor shows a &quot;going to sleep&quot; message so let's move on.  </s>
<s> given the gma i have to guess the age but let's check if you are using the canned air to clean every few months.  </s>

<s> thanks for the reply, but i've tried the canned air inside the laptop and the pc still goes to sleep, usually after i start streaming video.  </s>
<s> and i'm definitely sure it's just going to sleep and not powering down.  </s>
<s> i just hit the enter key to bring it back to life.  </s>

<s> given the claims above i'd have to see the unit.  </s>
<s> i'd be checking all the sleep settings from bios or os. bob  </s>
