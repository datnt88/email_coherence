i have problem on setup multiple displays. i using dvi(1meter) connect to my acerx203h and vga(1m) connect to my hdtv. it is able to display my screen. the problem is when i replace the vga(1m) to vga(10m) cable, then there is no more display on my hdtv. so i wonder whether is my vga(10m) have problem and i use it to connect between pc n my acer x203h. it have display but blur. then only i notice the length of vga cable will affect the display quality. but is this the reason my hdtv cant show? or other settings than i forgotten? because the problem is just between 1m vga cable and 10m vga cable..
this is why they make video extender boxes like this -&gt;  nothing really busted here but there are limits to how long cables can be. bob
so is the cable length make no display ?
or the cable has a defect. this is not to write why longer cables create issues but it's a well known issue with vga signals that has been around for nearly 2 decades. bob
