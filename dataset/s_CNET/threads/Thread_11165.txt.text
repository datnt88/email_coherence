i have a coworker that is running win 2000, and uses aol dial-up. as soon as he get online, his entire system locks up. ctrl-alt-del does not help as he has to unplug his system to reboot. we updated his video drivers (ati radeon 9200 se), used ad-aware to get rid of the sypware, ran norton win doctor, did all the windows updates. any suggestions? thanks.
you neglected the forum tip: &quot;if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; if you had written more about the machine, i may have asked (and still will) if the windows 2000 service pack 4 and all critical updates were installed plus drivers for the motherboard. tell more, get more. bob
did you re-install aol?
