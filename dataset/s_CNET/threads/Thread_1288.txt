(2) when cd is placed, the same dvd-rw drive reads it quickly and displays the typical small window asking to play with media player or open the folder etc; windows explorer shows file within the cd too and it is recognized. (3) when you dont have any disk on the drive and try to click the drive-letter (e: or f: etc) in windows explorer, it typically gives an error message saying please insert a disk in drive. for this faulty dvd drive, such error message does not appear (but other drives in the same pc, gives such message). (4) in device manager, it is rightly recognized and shows working properly. above all symptoms are true for both old and new replaced dvd drives. when i faced the problem with old dvd drive, i tried to change its firmware, with no success. on suggestion, i tried to restore system from the date when my old dvd drive was working fine; again no success. i tried all familiar process of uninstalling the dvd-rw from device manager and then restarting the pc when new hardware got recognized and installed; again no success. i tried the same for new drive too no success again. now emachines is suggesting to do the complete system restore (at the pre-sale status) that is so undesirable and has no guarantee to the resolution. i feel, it may not be any hardware or firmware problem. i dont remember installing any new software since last rightly working dvd drive days. i cleaned up pc from adware or spyware. please help or let me know any site/forum where similar problems were discussed or resolved. syamal
