hi i am interested in purchasing a netbook. i am a medical professional that travels overseas often to give presentations on various topics. would a netbook be powerful enough to run microsoft powerpoint? would the connection be compatible with every projector? are there any netbook specifications (amount of ram\cpu etc) that would be optimal for my needs? are there any specific netbooks that you can recommend? thanks rael
our office has no less than 3 netbooks. all have run our powerpoints fine. however none have embedded videos so this is why it works. would the connection be compatible with every projector? no. i've yet to find this to be true since it never fails that you will find one projector that has dvi and laptops don't have that. bob
i use my toshiba netbook all the time showing microsoft powerpoint presentations. and some of those even have linked video files, which play fine. when connecting to a projector, i have found that netbook running windows 7 starter edition syncs with the project without a hitch. i do these presentations on the road a lot, and being able to just carry the lighter weight netbook is great. also, the 7+ hours battery life means that i don't need to plug in the netbook's power cord. much nicer set up than even my 13&quot; laptop.
powerpoint works great on some netbooks, though i would get one that can hold at least 2 gb of ram. since running the software taxes the netbook more than projecting. the only power required to project is enough to send a signal to the projector or tv monitor. nearly all netbooks have a vga (15 pin) port which connects fine to either. i got an asus 1005pe in april 2010 and am impressed as can be. i've loaded ms office pro, acrobat pro, quicken premium and google earth with no problems. the weight and 11 hour battery life makes it great to travel and give presentations.
