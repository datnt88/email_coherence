<s> hi... i want to synch my laptop with my pc. anyone have any ideas what's the best way to do this?  </s>
<s> can activesync be used to do this?  </s>
<s> thanks, marc  </s>
<s> easy way (assuming you have your pcs set up as a homenetwork)- go to microsoft power toys for xp- download the synctoy- nice little application gives you lots of choices as in echo or combine or whatever you wish - allows you to set up jobs - so you dont need to go through the process each time-just ick a job and let it run.( and its free ) hard way go find a really expensive backup utility with 7 million options you dont want and probably will never need .  </s>
<s> if you dont have a homenetwork then easiest way is to use a burner , export you bookmarks and cookies from ie, find your outlook or outlook express save folder , copy that and everything else you want to a dvd and copy the dvd on to your laptop.  </s>
<s> copy the contents of the e-mail save folder directly into your laptop folder and import the cookies bookmarks into ie using the import export tool in ie and you should be good to go.  </s>
<s> look up synctoy (google.com) and see if you like it.  </s>
<s> &quot;anyone have any ideas what's the best way to do this?&quot; none at all.  </s>
<s> you didn't define what would make one solution better than the other.  </s>

<s> one may assume, and im sure the original poster will correct me if im wrong , that when people ask about synching laptops with desktops, what they really mean is they would like to have their laptop look like their desktop- same shortcuts same favorites and most of all their e-mail and documents readily available.  </s>
<s> synctoy will do just that over your home network, i personally use it everyday, for email and for documents- pictures music and other heavy files get done mostly before i travel so i will have the current stuff with me.  </s>
<s> this is the easy way, sure you can go and buy expensive software, sure you can burn discs for backup , those ways are either harder on your pocket or your time when your only talking about backing up one or two pcs.  </s>
