i've posted on 7 different forums and gotten no response. someone here please help!!!!!! my monitor is not responding. no matter what i do with that pc, it doesn't work. i've connected the monitor to my laptop and it works fine. but, downstairs on that pc, i've changed my card from pci to agp, i've changed the outlet, everything. help!!!!!!!
spamming the boards with multiple posts isn't a good idea and may cause people to wonder which post to reply do. best of luck, bob
what changed since it last worked? is there no video at all, no bios screen? does the monitor power light change color? describing a problem with a few details only leads to more questions. and try to stop yelling.
since you stated the monitor works with your laptop. you should check your motherboard. is there any reason why you were using a pci video card before when it has an agp slot? or does the mobo have an onboard graphics which has to be disabled before you can use an agp or pci video card? you need to give more info on your system otherwise no one can assist effectively. we are not in front of your pc and have no clue what components you have. maybe the cards has not been seated properly? tell the whole story.
