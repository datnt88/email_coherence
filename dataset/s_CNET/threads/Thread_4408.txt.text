hello, i never had this problem before and i can't find any possible settings that would be causing it. i have a motorola surfboard modem that is connected to my dd-wrt 54g wireless router. if i put in my external ip address in the browser while connected to my wireless network, it directs me to the correct local ip that i have it set to. if i try to access it outside my network it just times out and says &quot;response error. technical description: 502 bad gateway - response error, a bad response was received from another proxy server or the destination origin server&quot; any ideas of what i can look for? thanks!
you didn't share what you mean by access so i can't tell if this is a ftp, telnet or other type of access. because of problems that occur with &quot;users&quot; many isps now block network sharing ports. bob
thank you for your quick reply. i am connecting for browser access. it is going to my raspberry pi that i have running raspbmc (xbmc). i have tried using different ports because like you said they block access certain ports. i wonder why i am able to connect within my network using my external ip though, that seems strange to me.
by browser access i mean i am literally entering my external ip into the browser window.
ok i just changed it to port forward to another web server i have and it will connect to that in the browser outside the network no problem. this leads me to believe it's an issue with the pi and not the network. i will have to do more research. i can connect to the pi by it's internal ip address however so i am not sure why i can't connect by port forwarding.
turns out that by default raspbmc on rasperry pi refuses any connection from any port outside the network. something to do with ip tables. something i will have to look into another day.
i take it that you put the pi into the dmz if you have a router?
