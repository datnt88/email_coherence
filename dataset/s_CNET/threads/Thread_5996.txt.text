my computer keeps showing a blue screen and it will shut down. what can i do to get rid of this problem
given only what's in your post it's either the pc or the os. nothing i've found can diagnose this further. try this. post in the os forum that applies and don't spare the details. bob
need a lot more information to try to assist. assume that you have tried booting to safe mode. again, need more info.
the message that i am getting says the following: &quot;a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. driver_irql_not_less_or_equal check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. if this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows update you might need. technical information: stop: 0x00000001 (0x00000000, 0x000000002,0x00000008, 0x000000000)
you have more to share but that stop code doesn't give me the details to work the issue. i know this sounds terrible but you might want to consider reloading the os if details can't be found. bob
