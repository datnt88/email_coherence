<s> i'm trying to figure out which way is the best - buying a kindle fire, or nook tablet. the e-reader was the original inspiration to buying one of these, however, since there's the fire and the tablet which gives you some very good extra features - apps, web browsing, email - i thought the extra dollar amount could be worth it.  </s>
<s> but i'm not sure if you're really comparing apples to apples between the two.  </s>
<s> do i go for the fire which seems to have the better apps, the kindle/amazon cloud, and amazon store.  </s>
<s> or, do i pay an extra $50 for a better device, faseter, bigger storage, but not as great of a store like amazon?  </s>
<s> does the nook tablet have a cloud like the kindle fire, or is it just some sort of gimmicky thing which isn't really of much value?  </s>
<s> does anyone have an opinion, one way or the other?  </s>
<s> i can always seem to get good adive from b&amp;n about the nook tablet, and they are able to tell the pros and cons, and their bias for or against and as it relates to the kindle.  </s>
<s> on the other hand, finding a kindle fire seller who also knows about the nook tablet and the pros and cons from a kindle bias is....well, i haven't found anyone.  </s>
<s> these are going to be christmas gifts, so if anyone can help with some input, that would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> we have the nook at the office and it's missing the camera, and i think the g sensor.  </s>
<s> it's also quite heavy compared to some 7 inch tablets. the samsung 7 inch models would get you the real thing and still let you use amazon's market as well as bn's market.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have a nookcolor and a kindlefire.  </s>
<s> i do not have a nooktablet.  </s>
<s> i believe there is littlle difference between the n-tablet and the n-color.  </s>
<s> if the person you are giving it to is primarily interested in reading then the nookc may be better.  </s>
<s> i like it more because the features important to a book reader are better with the nookc a and a couple very necessary features such as being able to sort your books are completely missing in the fire.  </s>
<s> if they want to stream videos and have wifi then the fire with membership in amazon prime is great.  </s>
<s> nook doesn't have anything like that.  </s>
<s> storage - barnes and nobel has an sd card slot because they are hideously selfish with the onboard storage in both the nookcolor and the nooktablet.  </s>
<s> nearly all the space is reserved only for b&amp;n purchased content and they do not allow you to see or move anything in there.  </s>
<s> less than 1g is for the user. the fire has 6g onboard storage for the user and no sd slot.  </s>
<s> but they also have unlimited &quot;cloud&quot; storage.  </s>
<s> i don't see anyone complaining about the cloud or it being difficult to access.  </s>
<s> price - fire - $199.  </s>
<s> color - $199.  </s>
<s> tablet - $249.  </s>
<s> sd card for the nook - ($) .  </s>
<s> prime membership for the fire - $79 a year (needed only for free prime videos and other perks.) both can get netflix and hula for a small monthly fee.  </s>
<s> i think he nook color is a little better than the kindle.  </s>
<s> i had hands on experience with both before i decided to go with b&amp;n.  </s>
<s> there's a great comparison guide here: .  </s>
<s> hope that helps!  </s>
<s> i compared the two and decided on the nook. the tie breaker was the way a small child can use the nook for interactive children's books. the feature includes being able to record your reading of the book for the child to listen to.  </s>
<s> i have experimented with my nook for a couple of weeks now and am pleased with it with only a couple of nerdy reservations.  </s>
<s> in fact, during this time i have down- and side- loaded items as samples, and full books from barnes and noble, from my local library, and from the internet epubs and pdf books and got everything working.  </s>
<s> getting rid of books that i no longer want was a little problem.  </s>
<s> i also downloaded audio books.  </s>
<s> of course, i also put the nook pc program, adobe digital editions, overdrive media console, and the kindle pc program on my desktop and got them all working.  </s>
<s> all the media i have played with were the free stuff.  </s>
<s> i haven't actually bought anything yet! now i am happily reading all the books i can handle and am very pleased.  </s>
<s> a recent trip to the hospital saw me sitting in waiting rooms reading books and checking the web.  </s>
<s> you need a local wireless connection, but they are all over the place, and i run a router at home.  </s>
<s> for the very close difference in price, i'm glad i got a nook.  </s>
<s> of course, the negative reviews of the fire here on cnet made me feel i had chosen correctly, but i assume amazon will get those details straightened out soon.  </s>
