(price maximum of $300) what speeds do they operate at? do you know where i can find information on this product? also what kind of motherboards will support this dual core? another question unrelated to cpus, do you suggest that i buy a pci express motherboard and gcard? i'm leaning toward agp 8x because of its value but i'm not sure of the agps longevity.
