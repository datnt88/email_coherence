<s> it looks like some old stuff alright.  </s>
<s> i thought much use can be had unless someone really needs it.  </s>
<s> offhand, use the minimum bid of $1 as any s/h will cost as well.  </s>
<s> -or- sell as a lot for $10 or more, but be practical it is old stuff.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> to get an idea of the value of a piece of hardware, search for it on ebay.  </s>
<s> use the option on the side of the page to view &quot;completed&quot; sales as most stuff like this will not find any buyers.  </s>
<s> if you live in a craig's list area, that's probably a good place to try to move some of your old &quot;goodies&quot; since there is no listing fee or seller's fee on craig's. the ebay listing fees on this &quot;yesterday's&quot; equipment list will bleed you dry.  </s>
<s> perhaps a better idea would be to find some place that takes &quot;tax write off&quot; where you might recover a bit of yesterday's values.  </s>

<s> i tested the hardware already.  </s>
<s> how else would i know about the low cmos battery on one of the motherboards.  </s>
<s> i also loaded an os and played some audio cds on the sound cards.  </s>
<s> spent over a week testing everything and except for the battery it all works.  </s>
<s> best bet is to ebay it and hope you get it gone. the items you noted are found in dumpsters around my town every week.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> set your opening bid under a buck, 99 cents or a penny.  </s>
<s> no pics, buy it know or other enhancements will keep your listing fees down.  </s>
<s> figure accurate shipping to cover yourself.  </s>
<s> be realistic, it's only worth what you can sell it for. the second highest bidder will determine your selling price.  </s>
<s> i'd sell most of it as a &quot;lot&quot;.  </s>
<s> somebody will buy it, but cheap!  </s>
