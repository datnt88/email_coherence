(i was going to use wpa, but my laptop does not accept wpa, so i am using wep.) my landline computer has internet security with firewall enabled and internet virus scan. first, is there an easy way to test to see if i have adequately protected my wireless network so that no one can use my network or gain access to my home computer? second, i haven't figured out how to properly set up the firewall on the di-624 itself. is this necessary or is having the firewall on my computer sufficient. i'm a newbie at the whole wireless realm, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
