<s> hi, i installed a network card on a pc with windows me.  </s>
<s> earlier the same card was installed on a windows 2000 pc. now, when i have connected the pc to the network, i was able to see the lan status icon in windows 2000.  </s>
<s> there was a option to activate it in windows 2000 too through network properties.  </s>
<s> i not able to see this status icon in windows me even am using the same nic card.  </s>
<s> i was not able to find any option too like windows 2k to turn it on.  </s>
<s> please help me as how to display this network status icon on windows me  </s>
<s> and not having me in front of me, i would say the option is on the properties page of your local area connections of your nic.  </s>
<s> from what i learnt after seaches and searches on google, and other persons on different forum too, is that this feature is not avaiable in windows me.  </s>
<s> but, now to moniter network status you can use another free network status monitering tool like netgraph its a neat and free program... i am using it and works great for me.  </s>
<s> thanks to a person on annoyances who helped me.  </s>
