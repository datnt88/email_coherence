can a powerbook connect to a linksys router that is old but carries b/g? 
its a brand new, and i'll add very sweet, powerbook with airport card. 
sorry bob, couldn't resist p 
back atcha! 
i was a damn fool. 
all i had to do was bring the damn thing a foot closer to the router and i didn't have to spend a second setting up. 
i love this thing. 
if it's that close try this. 
-&gt; notes a free parabolic reflector you can make that could give your router a free boost.
