bought this p4 desktop in 2001 or 2002, but it is tweaked to my liking, nice sound/video cards, plenty of ram, fast enough, and i am not using it for advanced applications so i want to keep it. i remember hearing that as computers age, some parts can go bad. should i replace the hard drive? also, is there some kind of aging issue with the bios? i seem to remember that there is a bios chip or battery that might die after several years, rendering one's system useless. lastly, this may be a silly question, but i need to upgrade to usb 2.0, can i just buy a usb 2.0 pci card, and install it, or is a motherboard from 2001 not going to be able to handle it anyway? thanks!
however i do need to remind myself to dust out the machines yearly and replace any failed fans. bob
make sure you unplug the pc from ac power before doing anything inside. re the rest...start by making sure it's 'relatively' dust free. especially make sure the cpu heatsink and fan are to the max extent possible free of dust. same with power supply and case fans. the other thing is backup ... storing your must have data somewhere in addition to you pc hdd. vapcmd
thanks. yup i do make sure that it is relatively dust free, and i unplug and touch a ground first to de-static-ize myself b4 swapping out cards, etc.
there is a battery that keeps the bios alive when you turn the pc off. they last 4-5 years. it's located on the motherboard and is a flat, silver battery. when it starts to die your clock will forget the time. when this happens, replace it.
