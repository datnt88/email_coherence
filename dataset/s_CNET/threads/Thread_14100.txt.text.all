<s> i have an hp d2430 printer that i use with my compaq v6444us notebook when i'm away from home.  </s>
<s> yesterday, a dialog box appeared with &quot;solution center the feature you are trying to use is on a cd-rom or other removeable disk that is not available.  </s>
<s> insert the &quot;solution center&quot; disk and click ok.&quot; since i was not trying to &quot;use anything&quot;, i don't know why this dialog box appeared.  </s>
<s> this printer is just that ... a printer only which works great.  </s>
<s> how do i keep this message from reappearing?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> try the microsoft installer cleanup utility.  </s>
<s> found with google.com it can delete those pesky &quot;pending installs.&quot;  </s>
<s> &quot;backup the machine first&quot;, do you mean to back up all critical files to a flash drive or a disk or something else; i.e., backing up the entire pc using something like norton ghost, acronis, or pc backup?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> while i have never had an issue with this tool some get squeamish over the tools warnings.  </s>
<s> your choice on this one.  </s>
<s> for your responses.  </s>
<s> i had this same problem a few months ago, and no idea what caused it then either, but i'm drawing a blank about what i did to resolve it.  </s>
<s> thanks again for your help.  </s>
