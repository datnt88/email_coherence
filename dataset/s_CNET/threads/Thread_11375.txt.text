hello, i'm a high school student, and i was woundering what type of motherboard/cpu combo would be something that i could afford. i don't really want to spend more than $300 on the pair. i am a gamer, i would like to have serial ata, raid 0 + 1, and at least 4 slots for memory(specificly ddr400), amd hopefully, and other goodies like that. what would be the best bang for the buck for the things that i would like? also, i would like a bios that i can overclock with, and set memory timings.
selection of mobo's at  and  you see all details and pro's and cons. generally in groups by cpu or by chipset.
tomshardware is an excellent source for information. pricewatch searches many different sites for the best prices for a lot of stuff. newegg's prices are very competitive. i would recommend getting it there if it is only a few dollars more than somewhere else.
hi, also check out tirger direct thay have a lot of cpu and motherboard combos, an amd 64 bit processor and mb for under $300. if there is a fry's electronics close by the have many combo specials also newegg is very good also. john
