media that works with a benq dual layer dvd drive? the dw1655, to be precise. i have verbatim and memorex. neither works. i'd hate to have to buy media just find out which one works. thank you
maybe not all softwares works with double layer.just think out loud.
i generally use cd-r or cd-rw media to record songs from my itunes library. i installed my new dvd drive and had some initial troubles with it. i wanted to see if it would be an all-around useful recording drive. it records to dvd+rw just fine. i don't have a big enough file to test the dual layer functionality. my lite-on dvd recorder has yet to come across a media it doesn't like. but, of course, it isn't a dual layer unit.
i found a firmware update for my benq drive released just yesterday, 1-20-06. i flashed it in and verbatim cd-rw will work with the drive now. still can't get memorex cd-rw to work with it. the memorex is rather old, though.
