<s> the first thing to check is the small print of your contract with your isp. if that doesn't allow sharing wifi outside your own home (and usually it doesn't), this discussion is a no-go on this forum.  </s>
<s> so please provide a link to their tos.  </s>
<s> we're a law-abiding forum, you know.  </s>

<s> no probs will do ... my neighbour is family, so don't know if this make any difference .... but will check ... thanks for the info kees regards gary  </s>
<s> get a quote to see what the cost is.  </s>

<s> lmao so sorry i meant 50 meters ... 50 m to me has always been meters ... miles is 'ml' ... i'm from the uk so it must mean different in other places, sorry i should have put meters gary  </s>
<s> put the router in los of the target and then off to the kitchen to soup up the wifi.  </s>
<s> here's the video.  </s>
<s> 50 meters might not need anything but i find folk stick the router in the basement then ask why wifi is so terrible.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> weren't it yards?  </s>
<s> and miles in stead of km? and lb's in stead of kg? kees  </s>
<s> lol ... i live in spain now .... but there's so many foreigners in the uk ... it could be anything now  </s>

<s> my router is upstairs and my uncle has an edimax ew-7612uan v - it's a 3db, 300 mbps usb antenna ... but he signal is weak and will not work if we put a usb cable longer than 3m on it  </s>
<s> just last week i read a manual with the phrase &quot;metric meters&quot; and will have to see why they added that.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i thought you wrote &quot;50m away from in los&quot; so what are you saying here?  </s>
<s> if it's not in line of sight (los) then it's not and all bets are off.  </s>
<s> you can forget about 300 mbps since that's under ideal conditions such as 6 meters or less with no obstructions.  </s>
<s> try plain old 802.11g settings on the router.  </s>
