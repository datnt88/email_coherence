i have my xp connected with my me via d-link. how can i get access to the hd of the me from the xp? do i just change the properties of the me hd? thanks
you should review such sites as:   to see if you forget a step (sharing a folder) or if you installed a firewall that is blocking the share. bob
first, make sure your two computers are in the same workgroup: in me, right click on 'network neighborhood' and select 'identification'. in xp, right click on 'my computer' and selct 'properties'. choose the 'computer name' tab and click on 'change'. next, on your me computer, turn on file sharing. get there by opening 'network' in the control panel. finally, choose the folder(s) you would like to share: open 'windows explorer' (windows key + e). right click on the folder to be shared. choose 'sharing...' turn on sharing in the window that opens, and your done!
