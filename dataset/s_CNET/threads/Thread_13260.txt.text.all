<s> hi, i bought a splitter to split (obviously) the only ethernet port from my modem to two different computer, but for some reason i can't.  </s>
<s> when i try to connect two different computers to the splitter, both of them keep struggling to stay connected.  </s>
<s> the messages than appear are: limited but not connectivity the cable is unplugged the normal message than appear once there's a successful connection established i believe than both of them are using the same ip address what can i do?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance  </s>
<s> you cannot use a splitter for either cable or ethernet.  </s>
<s> each device needs its own port.  </s>
<s> get a router.  </s>
<s> i almost forgot to check for replies.  </s>
<s> thanks, i'll buy one.  </s>
