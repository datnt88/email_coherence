<s> the 'safely remove hardware' icon keeps appearing on my bottom tray.  </s>
<s> i have installed and disabled, reinstalled...have had several discussions with hp regarding this issue, and still no resolution.  </s>
<s> every suggestion initially worked. the icon reappears after reboot. the issue are my usb ports: 1) printer port, the other three are media ports.  </s>
<s> os: windows xp media center. is anyone else out there having this problem?  </s>
<s> all comments and suggestions are appreciated.  </s>
<s> i also have that icon, it's for the cable modem, i ignore it.  </s>
<s> ... any time you have a usb device connected to your pc you'll get this message.  </s>
<s> what it's telling you is that you need to disable the connection to the usb device if you want to remove it from the system.  </s>
<s> once you've done that, it gives you an &quot;ok&quot; message.  </s>
