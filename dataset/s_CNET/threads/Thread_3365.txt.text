hello, i have an asustek p4b motherboard, which has 3 slots for memory. i have 2 sticks of 512 in there and i am trying to add a third stick of 512. i can put in any of the 2 sticks, into any of the 3 slots (conclusion all the memory is fine and the 3 slots are fine also). but whenever i put in all 3 sticks of memory windows xp will not start up. it keeps trying to start up over and over again. i cannot even get it to start up in safe mode. does anyone know what might be the problem? thanks in advance!!
you tried it with just the one new stick. but there are boards that do that. you have little choice but to replace ram or the motherboard. bob
have been many mbs that simply won't function when all dimm slots are used/populated even if the ram is 100% compatible with the mb. vapcmd
hi all, thanks for your replies. i finally figured out what the problem is. it seems that the p4b motherboard cannot take 3 double-sided memory sticks!
