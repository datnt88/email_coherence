anyone out there knows where to buy a fan for a nvidia geforce4 mx 440se video card. a generic one will not work.
try  ? bob
all they have is generic ones. thanks for your help.
some 1,000 fans there. in closing, you might never find the exact fan. i mount close enough all the time with custom mounting plates. bob
thanks for your time and help. i am going to get the generic fan and try to install it. you would think that nvidia would have a way to buy a replacement fan for there cards. george
there are replacement coolers out there for some of the geforce cards. my mind didn't think to look beyond the sources i use to solve this issue. for the people i deal with will not part with the money for a tennmax cooler so i just use generic fans. however i always get a ball bearing fan if i think the card/system will need to be used for more than a few months. hint: exacto blade knives, tin snips, plastic nuts, bolts and even plastic cable ties all make for great source material and tools to fashion a new fan mount. sometimes i have to take up space that blocks the adjacent pci slot, but what other choice do we have? at least at this price... bob
