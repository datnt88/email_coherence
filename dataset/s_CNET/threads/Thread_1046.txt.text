hello again... i hope this is the right forum to ask my question... im trying to install a hp deskjet 5940 printer on a computer with windows xp 64-bit, and when i insert the disk its says that its not compatible... so i did a google and i found some sites with what they say are drives for that printer and windows... the problem its that the drives are with different names and also different size... how can i now they are what they claim they are, and not some type of virus or malware or trojans or etc... the sites are:  com/ &  com/ also i found this other site:  . com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00625738&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=445440&lang=en#which recomends to install a driver from another printer and i did it, but i can not use all the features of the computer, just the basics... any ideas or tips will be greatly appreciated... thanks...
when hp doesn't supply a driver you might get to print at best and features like duplex vanish. nothing busted here. just how it works today. bob
i did a search and found this driver for you:  have you tried this one yet? jeff windows outreach team
yes its the one i have right now... x64 minidriver installation instructions - basic printing support... but is only the basic printing... so i cant use all the features of the printer... thanks anyway... ill keep looking...
look at  put a 32 bit xp in that and you can get all the old features back in the virtual os. sorry but i know the driver issue very well. bob
