i just purchased a epson stylus photo r320 printer. followed all the instructions when loading the software. when i connect the cable into the usb port i get the following error message. &quot;cmdnist has caused an error in krnl386.exe cmdnist will now close. if you continue to experience problems, try restarting your computer.&quot; i have restarted my computer and no luck. i am running windowsme on a gateway. any help would be greatly appreciated.
finds no hits and that's telling. usually i find that some trojan/virus/spy has install a too-similar filename and has upset the os. if that was a typo, then  is interesting and points to motherboard and usb driver issues. you can research this further at  bob
have you tried to hook up different usb device? like mouse, external hard drive... etc. do you have any error number?
yes i have. my mouse and keyboard work. i can hook up my digital camera thru the usb port with no problem. also i have hooked up an external hard drive in the past and it worked.
