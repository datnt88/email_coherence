<s> hi all, i have two internal hdds, and i want to use both of them.  </s>
<s> heres the catch, i want to install windows xp on both and i want them to be completely independent of each other.  </s>
<s> probably a select menu on startup.  </s>
<s> when i say completely independent i mean that these hard drives cannot access each other at all.  </s>
<s> it must be as if ive physically replaced one hard drive with the other when i choose one at startup.  </s>
<s> no apps, viruses or even windows processes can access both hard drives at the same time.  </s>
<s> is this possible? the computer is a gigabyte g31 motherboard and a e8400 chip. the hard drives are two sata 250 gb  </s>
<s> the boot magic feature of partition magic does what you ask with partition hiding.  </s>
<s> look into that.  </s>
<s> hd selector switch....use google.  </s>
<s> never tried one.  </s>
