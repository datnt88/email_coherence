<s> i want to upgrade to a larger hard drive, i did this a while back and when i did it was a nightmare because i had to reload all items, lost my emails and everthing.  </s>
<s> is there a &quot;wizard program&quot; to migrate to a new hard drive?  </s>
<s> any and all advice taken, serious.  </s>
<s> check this thread for info on transferring files to the new drive.  </s>
<s> utilities exist that will transfer, intact, an entire partition from one drive to another.  </s>
<s> there are some limitations as far as partition resizing but they can usually be expanded quite a bit.  </s>
<s> two i know are symantec ghost and drive image (was from powerquest but now owned by symantec as well).  </s>
<s> i use drive image and have no experience with ghost.  </s>
<s> it will make compressed partition images or, as mentioned, copy and resize entire partitions. the original drive needs to be fairly free of problems, however.  </s>
<s> as well, any existing problems on your drive such as spyware, viri and such will transfer nicely too.  </s>
<s> if using xp, this is a hardware change and might cause the need to reactivate.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>
