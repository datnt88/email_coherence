<s> hey there, i've had this computer for only 3 years and it's badly outdated.  </s>
<s> i'm wondering how much this computer would go up for (it's value) currently.  </s>
<s> the computer's specification: intel(r) celeron(r) cpu 2.40ghz - l2 cache: 256kb asrock motherboard: p4i45gv r5.0 intel(r) 82845g/gl/ge/pe/gv graphics controller video card 256mb ram 16x cd/rw + dvd (not-dvd rw) windows xp if there is anything i've missed please state so, thank you.  </s>
<s> try from 49 bucks if the restore cds are missing to 149 all working.  </s>
<s> hey there, thanks for your reply, i still have the full cds which came with this computer on a side note.  </s>
<s> my fault for not stating so.  </s>
<s> imho, i'll downgrade the value to $100-125.  </s>
<s> actually the xp os cd if not oem from the likes of gateway, dell, etc., maybe the full value of the system more than anything else.  </s>
<s> restore/recovery disks must be the actual disks shipped with system.  </s>
<s> in other words, if the xp cd is a &quot;retail version&quot; it has value.  </s>
<s> your asrock mtrbd., as well as the low amount of ram and celeron cpu is on the low-end.  </s>
<s> more than anything else, the buyer would be advised not to buy from a knowledgeable person, considering what maybe required to get into a higher level, etc.. a basic system from emachine while more expensive starts out offering much more and just as important, support.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
