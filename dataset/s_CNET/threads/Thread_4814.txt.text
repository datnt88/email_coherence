hi, i have a wireless network at home set up with the gateway wgr-200 router. i'm having trouble accessing 1 particular site (page not found). when i bypass the router completely, i can access the site. so i think the router's built-in firewall is blocking the site. how do i unblock this site? i can't find where i can configure the router's firewall. i can access the router's set-up page via the http link, but i don't see any option for configuring the firewall. i'm using windows xp, with a desktop, laptop and cable modem. thanks in advance, ed
i ran into this and it turned out to be an odd dns failure. but i can't connect the dots without that last detail. to see if it's a lookup failure use dnslookup (see google.com) on your machine. also my router has this feature (dnslookup) to help in such troubleshooting. bob
thanks for the response. when i bypass the router completely, i can access the site. i think the router firmware may be corrupted or something. i'm going to try to reset the router and upgrade the firmware.
