<s> hi cnet, presently i am using a wired router for internet surfing etc. i am using 2 pc's and both have wireless connection capability.  </s>
<s> i can see that there are wireless connections in my area and they are secured connections.  </s>
<s> if possible is there a way to connect wirelessly to one of these?  </s>
<s> you'll ask the owner of the wireless systems for the password.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> since you appear to already be paying for internet service, the obvious, easiest, and most reliable way would be to buy your own wireless router or add a wap to your existing system.  </s>
<s> are you wanting to drop your isp and tap into someone else service?  </s>
<s> if so, that may be illegal but is also very unreliable.  </s>
<s> i know that some communities have installed wifi that's available to subscribers at a cost that may be more attractive than some isps offer.  </s>
<s> you could check into that possibility if you wish.  </s>
<s> i don't know much about how these work but suspect they may offer less than air tight security.  </s>
