<s> i am scoping out solutions for a new pc.  </s>
<s> i would like to build it myself, but am unsure of available components.  </s>
<s> here are my needs.  </s>
<s> i do use photoshop, and i am upgrading to cs. as far as gaming, i would like to run some first person shooters, but don't need top end performance.  </s>
<s> i don't play much.  </s>
<s> my wife would also like for me to make it into a personal video recorder.  </s>
<s> and budget is an issue.  </s>
<s> i already know: i want 1gb ram i have a case & power supply.  </s>
<s> i know what hd and optical drives to use.  </s>
<s> what i don't know: processor, is an amd 64 a good choice?  </s>
<s> do i need 64bit?  </s>
<s> what else do i need to know about cache etc... mobo.  </s>
<s> how much stuff do i need.  </s>
<s> onboard sound is fine for me.  </s>
<s> onboard lan is cool.  </s>
<s> do i need pcie or agp slots?  </s>
<s> and, most of all, graphics cards.  </s>
<s> do i need one for the tv functions and one for the photoshop/gaming? is there a all in one solution that is more viable?  </s>
<s> what chipsets/brands are good?  </s>
<s> and overall, remember this is on a budget.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for the help  </s>
<s> these are less than $700.  </s>
<s> this is $850 and very good.  </s>
<s> hp pavilion a1250n minitower  </s>
<s> not sure that athlon 64 is the fastest on the market right now.  </s>
<s> pentium 4 at 3.4 ghz is the fastest, closely followed by the athlon xp. if you think you'll need serious speed, (video editing?) then dont go cheap on the processor.  </s>
<s> the thing with 64 bit processors is that there is no software that takes advantage of it properly.  </s>
<s> presumably there will be, one day, but they dont seem to be rushing to put it out.  </s>
<s> so it might not be worthwhile to invest in one.  </s>
<s> (i bought one when they just came out, and have yet to see any good returns on it.)  </s>

<s> (i bought one when they just came out, and have yet to see any good returns on it.)&quot; theres windows xp pro 64. there are faster processors such as athlon 64x2s and pentium ds. but these are dual-cores.  </s>
<s> athlon 64s are okay and for the price of around $700, pretty good.  </s>
<s> if you can afford, get a pent d or a64 x2. roger  </s>
