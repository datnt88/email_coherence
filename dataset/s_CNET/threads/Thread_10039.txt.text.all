<s> hi, i have a: hp pavilion dv6-1131ea and wanted to know if there would be any problems with adding a blu ray recorder to play movies and create backups?  </s>
<s> might be pretty expensive to change the internal.  </s>

<s> have you priced them ?  </s>

<s> you have the choice of either ext.  </s>
<s> type drive or replacing the int.  </s>
<s> drive.  </s>
<s> if you plan to replace the int.  </s>
<s> drive it must be a match or actually fits and uses the same i/f as the old drive.  </s>
<s> so, be 100% sure it will work with your laptop model#. the quick and easy method is just buy an ext.  </s>
<s> drive that plugs into a usb port or esata if so equipped for ease of use.  </s>
<s> that's it, just use as any other drive.  </s>
<s> i do suggest you buy the &quot;kit&quot; form so everything is all present for use.  </s>
<s> tada -[-----willy  </s>
<s> thanks for the replies.  </s>
<s> it was an internal drive i was looking for. the reason i asked was i seem to remember that the laptop or os needed a piece of built in software to enable you to play discs a bit like dvd software but hardcoded in.  </s>
<s> i was looking at this drive: it seems cheap enough and does what i want  </s>
<s> there is no free bluray player software.  </s>
<s> (this is true today and if anyone finds such, please share it.  </s>
<s> no, trials do not count!) this is why a bare drive may not do what you want.  </s>
<s> i've lost count of folk that get the drive then discover they need software.  </s>
<s> the sad part is if they had got the software with the drive, it would have been cheaper.  </s>

<s> hi i already have nero 11 for the recording side and cyberlink powerdvd 11 for playback on my win 8 comp  </s>
<s> at least you know what can be an issue.  </s>
<s> i'll not duplicate prior discussions about that title so be sure to ask how much to update to their latest.  </s>
