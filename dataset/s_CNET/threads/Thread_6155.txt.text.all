<s> just bought a buffalo whr-hp-g300n router that is capable of 300 mpbs.  </s>
<s> i have an hp dv4-1120us laptop with a built in broadcom 4322ag 802.11a/b/g/draft-n wifi adapter.  </s>
<s> got the router set up this morning, set it to the n settings, but my connection speed is still 54 mpbs.  </s>
<s> can anyone advise me on configuring my nic, or is it a waste of time?  </s>
<s> should i simply go with an n usb adapter?  </s>
<s> i'd like to take advantage of the faster router.  </s>
<s> thanks, steve  </s>
<s> back in draft n days you learned that higher speeds only worked where the client and the router were from the same maker.  </s>
<s> the lesson repeats today.  </s>
<s> but a comment.  </s>
<s> since your internet connection is about 10 times slower than 54 megabit, why fix this?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> well... i guess i got caught up in the numbers.  </s>
<s> i'm planning on buying a roku hd (xr) box to stream pandora and netflix wirelessly and just thought if everything was set up to be as fast as possible, i'd have less issues.  </s>
<s> i have a lenovo y530 over 802.11g and hulu does fine over 802.11g.  </s>
<s> i've tried cbs.com and a few others too.  </s>
<s> but there is one thing.  </s>
<s> my network is setup exactly like the sticky at the top of this forum.  </s>
<s> which is likely why i have so little trouble.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> which sticky (exactly)?  </s>
<s> there are a few.  </s>
<s> try the one with the most entries.  </s>
<s> hmmm... well, nothing sounds very complicated there... i do have my new router working fine, connected all external devices with no problems.  </s>
<s> i just set it up wpa2-psk (tkip) at 40hz.  </s>
<s> seems fine, guess i'll find out when i hook up my roku.  </s>
<s> thanks, steve  </s>
<s> but the forum sticky leans to wpa.  </s>
<s> i like wpa2 if only it would work with everything.  </s>
