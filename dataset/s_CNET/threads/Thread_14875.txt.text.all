<s> my disc drive has dissapeared.  </s>
<s> i can boot up and it's still there, and it's still listed under device manager, but programs don't recognize it and it's not listed in my computer.  </s>
<s> i'm running xp pro 64 bit and i tried to download tweakui because i saw that as a solution for someone with a similar problem in these forums but i can't find a compatible version for my windows.  </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> this issue is usually the same old registry keys noted at this article.  </s>
<s> thank you very much so far.  </s>
<s> i might have a 2 part problem.  </s>
<s> i deleted the reg keys but 1) there was no &quot;upper file&quot; where it said there was supposed to be.  </s>
<s> so i deleted &quot;default&quot; instead because it said &quot;cdrom/dvd drive&quot; next to it.  </s>
<s> upon restarting my disc drive is visible in my computer and everything else seems to work ok so i didn't break anything with the regedit.  </s>
<s> 2) new problem though is that i can't burn using my drive.  </s>
<s> it's like the computer knows there's a disc drive but has forgotten that it's able to burn stuff as well.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> sorry but given no title to said software that's the usual fix.  </s>
