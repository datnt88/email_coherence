<s> my brother has the only computer connected to the internet in the house and refuses to let us set up a home network because he's paranoid. is there any way to hook up both a wireless router and his computer to the cable modem seperately?  </s>
<s> i'd hate to have to get a whole seperate cable hookup.  </s>
<s> some modems have the standard ethernet connection and a usb connection.  </s>
<s> some allow both to be used at the same time, some don't.  </s>
<s> you'll just have to investigate the modems available to you.  </s>
<s> if a modem will allow both connections, connect his using the usb port, and then connect a router using the ethernet port for the other pcs.  </s>
<s> i think i'd have a heart to heart with my brother.  </s>
<s> just don't set up sharing and have him use a strong password on his system but if he is that paranoid, personally, i'd get my own hook up and even use a different server.  </s>
<s> i had a friend some time back with a similar issue and eventually that is what happened, separate hook ups and different service providers, what a nightmare that was!  </s>
