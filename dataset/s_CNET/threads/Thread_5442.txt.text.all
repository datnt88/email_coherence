<s> i need something tht willl really speed my pc up please help because i like to play games but it runs slow on my pc  </s>
<s> i find decaf to help.  </s>
<s> until you tell a bit more about the pc i'll have to ask that you switch to decaf.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> its a qtech windows xp home ,e, can u help ma speed up ma comp plz  </s>
<s> not much to work with so we'll have to just keep on the decaf for now.  </s>
<s> try telling the details of the pc such as video, cpu, ram, hard disk, etc. bob  </s>
<s> something like adaware (you can download it at download.com) or ccleaner.  </s>
<s> and ccleaner has a nice feature where you can go thru your startup in the tools section (they don't put them in your startup folder anymore), and individually remove startup processes.  </s>
<s> careful not to remove your antivirus or anything like that though.  </s>
<s> best to open up google and do a search on each process, and see what it tells ya.  </s>
<s> try a new graphics card in your pc.  </s>
<s> hi it sounds that you are maybe not aware of what components you computer is made up from.  </s>
<s> either try getting someone you know who knows what they are doing to look at it for you or alternatively take it to a computer shop and ask them what if anything you can do with it.  </s>
<s> not the best advice and probably not what you wanted to hear but i think probably the most sensible in this case.  </s>
<s> sheepy  </s>
