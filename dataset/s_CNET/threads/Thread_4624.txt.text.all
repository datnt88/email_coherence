<s> here's the situation.  </s>
<s> our historical society is publishing a photo-oriented history book using photos from individual's private -- and often family -- collection.  </s>
<s> what i am looking for is a high quality scanner that i can reasonably pack up and take to the contributor's home where i can scan the photos on site.  </s>
<s> specs required for scans: 300 dpi output size: at least 8 inches wide or 16 inches wide for a double spread.  </s>
<s> color mode: grayscale (8-bit) recommendations?  </s>
<s> thanks s  </s>
<s> but how about armed with a 8 megapixel camera i get great results and it's portable.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i work at a historical society and use a couple of portable usb-powered scanners (canon, xerox) with a laptop to do just as you say.  </s>
<s> either brand and others can be had for &lt;$100.  </s>
<s> by the way, scan black and white photos as full color, not greyscale, to get a good quality scan and be sure to save as tif files.  </s>
<s> you may want to scan at 600dpi as well to get the best image.  </s>
<s> the publisher requests that the color mode be set to grayscale 8-bit -- so we will probably follow that direction.  </s>
<s> what are the models of canon and xerox scanners you are using?  </s>
