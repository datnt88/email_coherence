<s> does anyone know a number to get in touch with someone at dell financial services who speaks a-m-e-r-i-c-a-n e-n-g-l-i-s-h??? i have had several run-ins with the india call center due to sending in a payment a couple days late, it doesnt seem to matter that the account was paid 7 months ahead of schedule.  </s>
<s> i like to think that the problem is the language barrier but i am afraid those people are truly stupid and rude.....bad combination for a customer service person.  </s>
<s> i have spoken to these people enough and have tried to communicate, but i am seriously to the point that i cant even extend them basic human respect.  </s>
<s> most of the americans i have spoke to have helped me and this time i need to call them because they owe me money.....word to the wise, make sure you have the correct account number on your check if you have multiple accounts with them.  </s>
<s> anyways, anybody know how to get ahold of them?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> not with finances but with a pc problem.  </s>

<s> i demanded to speak to the next tier support and was connected to america.  </s>
<s> i used this number when i talked to dell some time ago about my brother's dell.  </s>
<s> 1-800-433-6649 and ask for finance department in the usa.  </s>
<s> gee, if you have any type of problem with anyone in any business, just ask to speak to the supervisor, and go up the chain.  </s>
