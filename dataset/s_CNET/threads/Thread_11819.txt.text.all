<s> a couple of weeks ago, i was blissfully using my computer, minding my own business, when the screen flickered and dimmed as it switched over to battery power.  </s>
<s> i'd had problems with a/c adapters with other computers in the past, so i assumed it was a short in the wire.  </s>
<s> moving the cord around a little briefly got it back on a/c power, but even that quickly stopped working and i could see the battery was draining.  </s>
<s> (i hardly ever use the battery, so i guess it's no surprise.) i had enough time to save many large directories to an external hard drive before i shut down.  </s>
<s> i called dell to order a new adapter, but they told me they no longer stocked the model i needed as my laptop is one and a half years old (!!!), but they could send me a &quot;travel&quot; adapter for more money.  </s>
<s> i agreed.  </s>
<s> but when i received the travel adapter the next day and tried it out, i discovered my computer was running very slowly and the adapter was getting extremely hot.  </s>
<s> i returned the travel adapter to dell and found the regular adapter on ebay listed as new.  </s>
<s> my computer ran fine with the new adapter for several days, then switched over to battery again with no warning.  </s>
<s> this time moving the cord had no effect, and the battery drained even faster then before.  </s>
<s> i quickly shut down all my programs and turned off the computer just before it drained completely.  </s>
<s> so, perhaps i got a faulty adapter off ebay, but now i'm wondering if my problem is really the battery.  </s>
<s> i'm reluctant to try returning the adapter only to get a new one from ebay, plug anything in and turn it on, only to have something fry because the problem was elsewhere.  </s>
<s> any advice on what i should try next?p  </s>
<s> the port in which you plug your cord has probably become loose over the year.  </s>
<s> since your laptop is out-of-warranty, you could try resoldering it yourself (really cheap), finding an electronics shop to do it for you (reasonably cheap), or finding a laptop repair shop (expensive).  </s>
<s> if you've got any soldering skills, open that puppy up and warm up your cold soldering tool!  </s>
<s> i agree with ramarc.  </s>
<s> it sounds like a broken adapter socket.  </s>
<s> i have had this problem in the past and after opening the case (which is a big pain for such a small repair)and resoldering,i cut the adapter cord about four inches from the end and rejoined with a standard small connector.  </s>
<s> instead of unpluging from the notenook i now undo the connector and leave the fourinch pigtail in the socket.  </s>
<s> i know this approach offends those with a perchant for tidieness but i rate utility over tidieness.  </s>
<s> regards stewawrt  </s>
