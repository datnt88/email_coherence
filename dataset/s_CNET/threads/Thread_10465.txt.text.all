<s> good day to all i have a printer (canon ip 5300) and the printer overall works fine.  </s>
<s> but as soon as i try to print on a disc, using the cd tray, i can't seem to print in black.  </s>
<s> i started from scratch, and made a monochrome picture, which is either black or white, and when i print the picture using cd label print supplied by canon, it prints cyan(blue) instead of black.  </s>
<s> i tried selecting &quot;print in grayscale&quot; but it still comes out blue.  </s>
<s> i contacted canon about this, and i'm still waiting for an answer.  </s>
<s> i updated all the drivers and software, and i tried installing the printer on a mac os x desktop, and from that i'm still getting only blue.  </s>
<s> when i print on an a4 page, then it can print black, but simply not on the discs.  </s>
<s> can anyone assist me by telling me if there is something i'm missing, or if this printer is capable of printing black on discs.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance  </s>
<s> i'm having the same issue.  </s>
<s> were you able to resolve what the problem was?  </s>
<s> i have same problems with my mp610.  </s>
<s> i think it's the problem in cartbridgs, becous when i was using original canon colors it was ok. but now with other cartbridge bradn it prints cyan insted of black :s tried on the same dvd-brand (verbatim printable) funy is that other colors are ok only black is problem.  </s>
<s> on paper is evrything fine.  </s>
<s> if any one have a clue what is the reason pleas write me: rok.dezo[af]gmail.com  </s>
<s> i have been trying to print with my remaining big black c3 cartridge on cd/dvd media with canons cd-labelprint using my canon ip5000.  </s>
<s> it has never succeeded.  </s>
<s> not even with a brand new cartridge.  </s>
<s> i think it could be due to the fact that when printing and choosing printer properties i get a limited set of choices.  </s>
<s> there is a selection with a drop down list called &quot;bj cartridge&quot; which is limited to only one item on the list: color.  </s>
<s> i suppose it will then use all available cartridges except the big black c3 cartridge.  </s>
<s> that, i suppose, is the reason the disk comes out just as white as it was before attempting to print on it...  </s>
