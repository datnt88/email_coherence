i am looking for a device that connects to the internet (wireless or not) so that i could stream my online radio stations on and connect the device to my stereo. i was looking at the &quot;link medialounge dsm-520&quot; does this play all formats of streaming audio? help!!!
so bad that i took the loss on the chin and gave it away. do not buy these unless you get to test drive it. frankly i get more from my netbook than that dlink media center. bob
thanks for the info. what about the squeeze box? any other products out there?
1. i stand by my advice. do not buy unless you can test drive them. many are astonishingly bad or have other issues you will only discover after you set it up. the flaws rarely are written up in reviews. 2. go ahead and find reviews but again, test in real life before you buy.
