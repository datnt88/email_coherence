(but does that open me up to all internet traffic?) the pc is running windows firewall. file and printer sharing are excepted from the firewall, but i still can't see the laptop and don't see any other place to specify the workgroup or laptop to allow traffic. anyone have any ideas? i'm out of 'em. thanks - --beth
