i have two hard drives, one floppy drive, one cd rom drive and one cd/rw drive. is it possible to hook up a zip drive using a 3 device ribbon cable. i would like to put it on the same ribbon cable as the two cd roms i have now. the zip drive was given to me and works fine. i just do not want to loose a cd rom or hard drive in order to hook it up.
sorry, only two. my workaround has been to add an external usb case. bob
the zip drive is an internal drive. i really would like to keep it that way. this is why i wanted to use a 3 device ide 40 pin ribbon cable and hook it up in line with my cd rom's
but remember these issues: 1. ide ports support two devices. you can cable up more, but it won't work. having dealt with those that insist, i have such a cable handy so they can try it themselves. about 1/2 are angry it doesn't work. the other 1/2 seem to like trying. 2. ide pci cards may not support cd, cdrw, dvd or zip drives so be sure your selected ide card supports what you are going to plug into it.
