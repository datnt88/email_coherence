hello i'm going to build my own gamer pc for the first time. i have a list of the hardware i'm going to buy. - graphics card: geforce gtx 580 - cpu: core i7-950 - motherboard: asus rampage extreme iii republic of gamers - ram: 2 x 6 gb kingston hyperx - hard drive: hitachi deskstar 7k2000 - blue-ray: bh10ls30 super multi blue - power supply: corsair tx650w it would be nice if you could make some comments about what you thought about it and may also make some suggestions on what else i can buy but it should not be much more expensive than what i've already selected. thanks in advance
- i've heard antec performance cases (for ex. the sx630ii) are good because they have built in filters to catch all the dust and it never gets in ur machine. idk if you already have a case or not. - make sure you have a couple fans since that is gonna generate alot of heat. - that is an excessive amount of ram unless youre using your computer as a server. nothing wrong with it but it would save you alot of money to drop to one 6gb stick. 4gb is sufficient for almost all games right now. - i prefer western digital hard drives for myself. if ur looking for speed maybe check out one at 10000rpm's instead of 7200 - and hopefully youll be using windows 7 on a machine like that.
one thing you may want to look into is a liquid cooling system. they are not much $ these days and can help keep your system cool. you may want to look at  they have all kind of gaming ideas.
i too like western digital hdd. if you look into them stick with the &quot;black&quot; since they are built better, run cooler and have better warranties than the green or blue. cost a little more but are worth it.
you might want to recheck that ram. i'm getting the impression this mobo uses tri-channel. 4gb per slot limit and maybe 2gb per slot limit depending on speed. i'll let you dig into that.
