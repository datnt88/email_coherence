7595	4	120284	1366680	1365577	michael geist	8/17/05 2:53 pm	1.12429038e12	i usually set the server....	to hold a copy for 5 days, that's enough time for me. how it works is each pc when accessing oe will download any messages available. each pc will only download a particular email once. after 5 days (for me) the mail is removed from the server. the settings are where melati pointed.
