what is method of identifying following characteristics of a cpu: - full cache p4 or celeron - bus speed (mhz) - processing speed (mhz)
from a previous post.
both intel and amd provide pgms. to readily id the installed cpu. it should also give detailed reports on the cpu installed and how it is being set/configured if applicable. if the cpu is in &quot;hand&quot; find the number and look it up at the support websites of the manufacturer. some 3rd party pgms. may also provide similar info but not as full or complete. -----willy
you can always download the free belarc advisor (found with a google search) and it will tell you almost everything about a cpu and all the other hardware in a system.
and if you are holding the processor in your hand they won't work. go here  to locate the processor you are curious about then check the sspec page for the info. the sspec is a 5 character code on the processor and this link shows where it generally is located
