7969	3	558569	5287515	5287501	hforman	3/16/12 6:30 pm	1.3319226e12	as someone already suggested	first, take a look at what bandwidth you have natively. are you using cable for your internet access? what bandwidth do they give you? do you have dsl? same question! maybe it might be more beneficial to get more bandwidth but you'll have to ask your iinternet provider (isp) about what is available for at what cost. the other suggestion is very important too. even though you may not want to put any security on your router so it would be easy for your customers to use, there are two issues with this. first, as the signal for the wifi is not contained within your pub, others may be stealing your bandwidth using it for downloads, movies, and streaming music. what i would do is apply wpa2 wireless security. you can post the &quot;password&quot; (password-of-the-day or password-of-the-week) somewhere in the pub where your customers can see it. make sure that your next-door neighbors are not also your customers or you may need to change the password more often. you may be able to control the signal strenth in the wifi to try and keep the signal contained within the pub instead of leaking out to the neighbors. by the way, even if the &quot;neighbors&quot; are businesses, it would be a lot cheaper for them to have internet access by using your wifi then paying for their own so i would definitely use wpa2 security and change the passphrase every so often. there are also firewalls and packetshapers that would let you fine-tune what you will allow and what you will not allow. these could be pricey but maybe not. you can always do some research and see what the costs would be and what features you really need.

(password of the day!) it can be posted in a place that is not visible from the outside (through a window for example) but easy to see for customers. or it can be a card attached to the menu, the say as the &quot;special of the day&quot; {sotd} there are apps (like msdonalds and other places, that do not allow access to their free wifi until you agree to play by the rules. and i suspect those should be easy to find if your router cannot be setup to ask for a password. this will not stop leeches within the restaurant, but if bandwidth is the issue, many routers can be set with a bandwidth limit per connection. email and the like will usually be quite fine at 50 to 100k bandwidth (although some emails can get stuffed with lotsa of graphics) but to keep video feeds to a minimum, 100k bandwidth limits will make most video (especially movies) quite unwatchable, but even graphics happy webpages load relatively quickly.

(port 8080 is generally used for websites under development, though, where they are usually only to be viewed by the developers themselves, so you may not need to unblock it). secure it with wpa2 and use a passkey. provide your customers with the passkey on request. of course, this won't address the issue of a person who has in the past been a customer becoming a leech, but you can deal with this by creating a new passkey each morning or so.

(a brew pub / restaurant - which explains why i visit often.) they have customer wireless that's actually pretty good. but they're smart enough to not have a fixed password. when you show up, the hostess will give you a unique wifi key on a printed slip that's good for a couple of hours. when you sign into their web-auth, the key will give you access, but clearly expires after the normal guest access window. i don't know which system they're using, but it struck me as the most serviceable option i've seen in public use. it's certainly not something they're administering manually - something has to be generating the keys en-masse and setting the expirations.

7969	45	558569	5290318	5287497	webserf	3/24/12 9:51 am	1.33258266e12	i really think his best bet is:	to look into buying an unlimited internet plan, so that he can get back to building his business. if you take away the worry that leaches cause, you can focus on making your business the best it can be. this might cause an increase in internet cost, but i can just about assure you that many (or at least some) customers come because of the free internet. this results in increased revenue. increased revenue allows for the additional overhead of internet costs, and hopefully creates a profit that you'd otherwise not have. consider an unlimited plan and get back to work in/on marketing your pub! of course locking down your router at night by turning off the wifi radio and changing the login every day is also a help. a lot of this depends on willingness to spend time and a bit of money to set up a &quot;walled garden&quot; and/or other &quot;roadblocks&quot; to leeches.

(keep it simple stupid) this is a simple problem that only requires a simple solution. over-complicating the thing is a flag for impassioned pioneers of hacking. it is a challenge! something to defeat. (and most of the kids out there have some pretty good tools (other people wrote for other good purposes, as well as specialty hacker tools) be secure, but don't make yourself a target.

7969	49	558569	5290686	5287501	tumbleweed_biff	3/25/12 1:57 pm	1.33268382e12	my solution ...	i have read through a good number of the posts above, although not all, and have the following thoughts: first, a constantly/daily changing password will annoy your regulars. how much? i don't know, but it may cost you business. i think your best solution would be to first, post your expectations to customers. make sure they know that the service is not intended for high bandwidth use. second, configuring your local network. as noted by some, you need two separate networks: one for your business and one for your customers. this does not require two connections. assuming your current bandwidth can handle all the traffic of both, you would probably want to go with a switch or router as the first point of connection which has no other services going, beyond basic routing activity. not even a firewall. connected to that are two separate routers, one for your business and one for your customers. if you have a powerful (expensive) enough business router, this can be done with just the one appliance. i am assuming you don't have some high-end cisco or such appliance. on the router for customer use, it would need to have the ability to perform bandwidth throttling on individual connections. decide how much bandwidth you want to allow any given user to pull at any given time, set the throttling to that amount and all is taken care of. you might want to consider a second, secure connection for &quot;regulars&quot; and special cases to whom you wish to provide more bandwidth. the first customer connection would have no security beyond initial direction to a tos agreement. this will pretty much eliminate any need of support. if you enable security, you will almost certainly regularly have problems with customers connecting and needing help. you don't want that. any type of firewall will cause a reduction in available bandwidth, so beyond the inherent nat firewall, you probably don't want one. as you move to increasingly costly and advanced routers, requiring more advanced and expensive technical skills to configure and operate, there are ways to allow users brief periods of high bandwidth but then fall back to a slower bandwidth after some period of time. this would allow the casual users higher performance while making life not so nice for the big file down-loaders/media users. you have to balance things like a $2000 router and a $100 an hour network person to setup and maintain against the cost of higher customer bandwidth use and possibly having to increase the bandwidth to your business. i like the one suggestion given regarding a farady cage using chicken wire, but i'd have to question what that might do to things like cell phones and devices operating along those lines? would that kill my phones 4g reception? ... as others have pointed out however, the availability of the internet at such places is likely a significant draw to your business, providing you with additional customers who stay longer and probably purchase more so you have to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages to any given approach. you might consider establishing some means of simply monitoring the bandwidth used by any given connection. as others have also pointed out, the customer router/network should be off when the business is closed. check around and see if there are any roi studies covering this topic. i expect that someone has done such and let that be your guide: what is the return on investment by providing various types of access? with best wishes for your success, mike
