i just went to cable from dial up. got five email addresses. decided to keep records of which email is used where. i used one of them for one time, to go to linux central to buy a knoppix cd. i am now getting spam mail against that email address which has been used only once. what can i do to report this?? any ideas.
not a site/place i go near. bob
the spamming info re linux central be included.
i would run out of characters in this small box if i listed all the spammers that do this. bob
