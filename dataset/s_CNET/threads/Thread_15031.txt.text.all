<s> hello to all.  </s>
<s> i have absolutely no technical no how, but i did successfully hook up my wireless g router to modem.  </s>
<s> all light indicators indicate everything is set up right (ethernet cable from dsl modem to router and ethernet cable from router to computer, phone line to dsl modem), but i have no internet connection.  </s>
<s> previously was using usb with no complications.  </s>
<s> what am i missing?  </s>
<s> appreciate your assistance!  </s>
<s> and see how it turns out.  </s>
<s> immediate can be a phone call away from the router's maker.  </s>
<s> you didn't tell such details so i can't tell you much else.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> using linksys wireless g broadband router, westell (?) modem (via verizon dsl) and dell dimension system  </s>
<s> you accessed the router setup program and set up your userid and password?  </s>
<s> your usb used to go directly to the dsl modem?  </s>
<s> you had a program for logon running on your computer?  </s>
<s> you turned it off?  </s>
<s> you clicked &quot;disconnect&quot; and then &quot;connect&quot; in your router set up?  </s>
<s> your dsl modem to router connection requires a standard ethernet cable?  </s>
<s> i had to update the device's firmware (i will not tell how since you must follow their instructions!) then i had to connect to the router with a web browser and configure the router to log on to my isp (verizon).  </s>
<s> all the details such as name, password, pppoe had to be set so it would connect, then the other pcs worked too.  </s>
<s> your post is far too light on details so this is all i can offer.  </s>
<s> and immediate help is by phone to your isp or linksys.  </s>
<s> here it takes some hours for volunteers to notice your post and reply.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have the same problem as her!  </s>
<s> i'm using a linksys wrt54g and a alcatel speedtouch 511e.  </s>
<s> my connection is immediate i.e. the moment i on my com and after everything is booted up, the computer will connect automatically.  </s>
<s> however, i cannot connect if i were to bring the router into the picture.  </s>
<s> i'm using the cd-rom to install the router.  </s>
<s> according to the cd rom info, the first step was to not connect the router and allow the program to detect the original settings of the com.  </s>
<s> that i managed to pass. the second step was to connect the modem to the router and the router to the com and at this point i will be dis connected and my com can't detect the router nor modem.  </s>
<s> i agree, that doesn't seem to work from what i know.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> my modem uses either usb or ethernet connection.  </s>
<s> originally, i had a usb connection via verizon dsl.  </s>
<s> never had a sign on id; went directly to internet explorer.  </s>
<s> i hooked up the new computer to the modem via usb, just to see if it would work; it did.  </s>
<s> disconnected everything, attached router and modem ethernet cables accordingly.  </s>
<s> all indicator lights work, but no connection to internet.  </s>
<s> when i ran cd both for router and verizon, states no connection.  </s>
<s> tried this repeatedly.  </s>
<s> went to best buy to have the geek squad come in and fix, but if i can do it and save $170, would help.  </s>
<s> also now it appears the ethernet cable light on the back of the computer is not coming on.  </s>
<s> any suggestions appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
