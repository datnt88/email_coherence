for the new tenvis ip cameras, there are no more port forwarding and ddns settings, only 3 steps to install: 1. connect to the router, 2. seach the camera, 3. remotely view through our serial number(pc, android, iphone) features: 1. mega pixels 2. p2p 3. wireless 4. ir cut 5. night vision 6. pantilt ... tips: you can keep the new tenvis free if the reviews is provided in public. 
while i'm comfortable with ip settings i find folk are struggling with that. 
this camera, just like the others still requires the folk to know something about their network. 
and then you run into a firewall or other issue. 
-&gt; most of the support is never about the camera.

public review....no problem. 
i'm concerned there isn't going to be much advantage over existing products, but i'm happy to be proven wrong.
