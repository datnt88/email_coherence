im looking to upgrade my computer with some more ram, but im not exactly sure on what type of ram my system takes. i know there was a website that could inspect your system and figure it out for you, does anybody have that link?
download and install cpu-z. it does the trick for me:
enter your computer make & model into the memory finder at crucial.com for compatibility information.
make, model/series, and model number. also you system (or motherboard) manual should have such information. cpu-z can also help you verify the system/motherboard info under the mainboard tab.
