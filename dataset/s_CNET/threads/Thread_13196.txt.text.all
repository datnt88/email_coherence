<s> i installed a new lexmark x3470 all-in-one printer/scanner/copier last week on my computer.  </s>
<s> i have xp with sp2.  </s>
<s> today i turned on my computer and it took about 10 minutes to boot-up.  </s>
<s> if i unplug the printer cable from the computer it boots up as fast as ever.  </s>
<s> any ideas why?  </s>
<s> when this happens?  </s>
<s> the printer was turned off, but i uninstalled the software for the printer and then re-installed, and everything seems ok. thanks for the reply.  </s>
