<s> i am buying a new computer because i want a faster cpu.  </s>
<s> i recently installed a new hard drive in my existing computer.  </s>
<s> my system runs great!  </s>
<s> can i simply remove the hard drive from the old computer and install it in the new computer as the master drive ??? both systems are running xp sp1.  </s>
<s> this sure would be easier and less time consuming than copying all my files and programs from the old drive to the new.  </s>
<s> you can try, but most likely, you'll need to format the drive and do a clean install of windows on the new machine.  </s>
<s> xp does not like hardware changes and may balk at the changes.  </s>
<s> thanks for the comment...funny, i heard just the opposite, that xp is great at recognizing new hardware....thought that was what the plug and play is about.  </s>
<s> i have no reason to reformat the old drive....if the new machine will not recognize the old drive i then would use the new machine in the new machine but copy old drive files to new.  </s>
<s> have you had any actual experience swapping drives or copying files from one drive to the next??? tim  </s>
<s> xartrax: there are many ways to accomplish the transfer, but i ususally burn the files to cdr, then transfer to the new drive.  </s>
<s> this is a simple method and if anything goes wrong, you have a backup of you data on cd. here are some other methods posted by grif thomas in this thread.  </s>
<s> best of luck  </s>
