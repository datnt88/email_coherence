<s> hello, i have a win ce 6, 7&quot; laptop.  </s>
<s> at first i couldnt get online (ie).  </s>
<s> i got sent a file to install from the sd card, and it now works fine - except that when using it to browse the web, for no reason i can see, on random pages, it just suddenly goes off the internet and connects itself to the local intranet...meaning i cant view webpages - as i am just a personal user and dont actually have an intranet at all... its not certain sites or pages...because its never the same ones, sometimes i can see a page sometimes i can't... any ideas how i can disable the intranet function entirely or stop this happening?  </s>
<s> i cannot click on the icon, and there just doesnt seem to be anyway to stop it...if i hit the back button, it goes back online...if i need to look at a page and it wont let me, if i just keep trying over and over it will eventually let me stay online to see it...but then go off at another random page.  </s>
<s> this are just normal sites like facebook, yahoo, etc. thanks  </s>
<s> time to get it back to the maker or seller.  </s>
<s> unlike windows this version is pretty locked down.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks but its brand new...and works fine in every other way...and mostly surfs the net fine...what are you suggesting is defective? the internet?  </s>
<s> the software?  </s>
<s> the hardware?  </s>
<s> the intranet?  </s>
<s> the settings?  </s>
<s> i had a ce 5.0 that had a not well implemented wifi.  </s>
<s> yes, it's defective.  </s>
<s> you proved it.  </s>
<s> brand new does not mean they got the bugs out.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ok well thanks anyway but thats not very helpful to me...i am aware theres a problem with it already.  </s>
<s> i want help to fix it really, not just be told there is a fault also its win ce 6, not 5 cheers  </s>
<s> windows ce machines are unlike your common pcs.  </s>
<s> there are no user serviceable parts and we can't change the os. if it's busted then its busted.  </s>
<s> i can only guess you are new to windows mobile/ce.  </s>
<s> i'm just a programmer (and more) and took the classes and seminars on windows mobile, embedded xp and more.  </s>
<s> as i am not the person who created this image, i can't do much other than help you learn a bit about this issue.  </s>
