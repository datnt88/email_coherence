(nvidia 9400gt) and i need a new motherboard. i don't want to have to buy all new parts. here is the motherboard in question:  and i have g.skill ddr2 pc2-4200 i was wondering if my ram will work with the motherboard in the link? it seems to be the best board in question for it's price. thanks!

13997	12	345161	3057292	3057186	r. proffitt	6/7/09 4:23 am	1.24434858e12	define &quot;work.&quot;	some may insist this means it's like a car. you change the tire and then get in and drive off. in this case it's not simple. you change the motherboard and while it does work the os will not run. your pc will not work as before. windows is not running. the computer works but will likely need a fresh install of windows but that oem windows may fail. i hope you see the problem. bob
