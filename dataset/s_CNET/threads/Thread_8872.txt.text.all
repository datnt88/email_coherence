<s> ok so im a trainee in a it dept, and i was tasked to configure a wap(wap-6011 level one). the wap needs to be configured to extend a network from a wifi router so that coverage is available for all corners in the office.  </s>
<s> having little knowledge in networking, this task was meant to provide some exposure on configure network devices.  </s>
<s> however i cant seem to get the wap going.  </s>
<s> i'd tried almost every single operation mode that is given with universal repeater seems to be the most plausible option to go for, in which i can get connected to the wap from other devices but no access to internet.  </s>
<s> any guides/pointers would be much appriciated.  </s>
<s> (do excuse my posting should it contain any errors because its my first time posting).  </s>
<s> i think it's best if you go and talk with your mentor or supervisor or whatever he's called, and ask for a little bit of help.  </s>
<s> after all, a traineeship implies being trained.  </s>
<s> and showing you're open to learn from him makes a good impression.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> it might.  </s>
<s> it's just that i'd like to somehow try myself first before i go to my supervisor for help else it'll make me look like a lazy person no trying.  </s>
<s> so far the options i tried i had no clue or whatsoever they does so it does help if you give me some general idea/description on where should i be heading towards.  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply  </s>
<s> then you get out the book on the product and follow its install/setup procedure.  </s>
<s> if it requires information about the installed system you ask for that.  </s>
<s> i've encountered new it staffers that get upset as i go to the manual and we read it together.  </s>
<s> they don't last long.  </s>
