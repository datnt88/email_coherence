<s> hello, i have a d-link di-514 wireless router and i've been using it from past one year, i connect my laptop and mobile through wifi with my pc(windows xp), it has been working fine till now, all of a sudden fron last night my laptop and mobile are unable to detect the wifi signals(provided, internet on pc is working fine), i tried all possible trouble shooting steps but, none worked for me....can you please suggest me what possibly might have gone wrong, and what am i supposed to do, to make my wifi router working again.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> turn the wifi off and on in the router.  </s>
<s> now be sure the security is set to wpa and you broadcast a single ssid.  </s>
<s> i've found that helps if it's the usual issue.  </s>
<s> if not, try another router.  </s>
<s> i tried selecting all types of securities(wep,wpa,..) available in the drop down, but none worked.  </s>
<s> how can i check, if my wifi is working or not ?  </s>
<s> can u please suggest me....  </s>
<s> the next test requires another router.  </s>
<s> turn the wireless off, then on?  </s>
<s> are you broadcasting ssid?  </s>
<s> try power cycling the router.  </s>
<s> turn it off for 30 seconds, then back on.  </s>
<s> if no joy, it's time for a new router.  </s>
