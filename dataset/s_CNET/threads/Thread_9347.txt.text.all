<s> i just bought a geforce 8600gt graphics card so that i can play some games, as my current graphics card was too bad to support the games i wanted to play, and someone recommended the 8600gt to me as a graphics card.  </s>
<s> can somebody please tell me how to connect graphic card to my pc ?  </s>
<s> and whether or not i will need to get some other things to connect it, like a cable or something ?  </s>
<s> ...you remove the cover and plug in the card into the pcie x16 slot, which presumably your computer has.  </s>
<s> i would hope this card comes with an installation booklet, but two things you'll need to do are to disable any built-in graphics on your mobo or cpu and install the driver that comes with the card.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> if you research the 8600 defective posts on google you would only use this model if it was free.  </s>
<s> there is no way to &quot;connect&quot; such a card.  </s>
<s> we do open the case to plug them into the card slot but such install instructions are all over the web so i'm guessing you really are asking how to connect it.  </s>
<s> sorry, there is no such system in today's pcs.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
