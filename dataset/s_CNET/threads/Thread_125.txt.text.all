<s> hello! i am looking to purchase a dvd rom/burner for my dell dimension 2400 desktop (running windows xp). it came with a cd burner and cd player but not a dvd rom.  </s>
<s> i have googled my fingers to the bone and have &quot;chatted with&quot; dell support to find out what dvd burner would be compatible with my system (i really want to install an internal one) to no avail.  </s>
<s> this is strictly to play pc games but because the burners are so reasonable on newegg.com,  </s>
<s> i thought i would get a burner instead of just a player.  </s>
<s> thank you in advance and sorry for the novel!  </s>
<s> these run about 30 bucks and as you can see at it shows 2 cd or dvd drives in the picture.  </s>
<s> you'll remove one of those, set the jumper of the new drive to match the old drive (or research ide jumper settings on google) then put it back together.  </s>
<s> dell.com has documentation on the disassembly so i won't write about that.  </s>

<s> here's one:  </s>
<s> i installed a dvd burner in a friends 2400 awhile ago and just went to circuit city and picked up a hp brand burner for less than $50.00.  </s>
<s> installed it and it has been working good for her.  </s>
<s> dell told her that only a dell burner would work, thats not true. the only problem i had was one screw was just a hair off, but it does fit.  </s>
<s> just set both drives to cs. it came with nero 7 if i remember right.  </s>
<s> wow, i was expecting a vague answer and you pointed me to the exact product (hopefully!) that i need.  </s>
<s> cannot beat a $21.00 price tag, either.  </s>
<s> thank you very much, ramarc and thank you to the other posters who responded as well.  </s>
<s> indiana jones pc-dvd game here i come!  </s>
<s> thank you for that website.  </s>
<s> i am going to save it when it comes time to install the dvd burner.  </s>
<s> i am getting better at the nuts and bolts of the system after upgrading memory and graphics card this year.  </s>
<s> thank you again!  </s>
<s> mopscare42. all good advice here.  </s>
<s> i am going with the cheaper version above.  </s>
<s> cross your fingers for me!  </s>
<s> thank you again.  </s>
<s> it was on sale (beats the old 95 buck price) and i get lightscribe too.  </s>
<s> this may be a little off subject, but do those lightscribe discs ever go bad? the reason i asks is because i have some memorex dvds that are about 3 years old and i can only get about 3 out of 10 to burn lightscribe.  </s>
<s> also, should one store the lightscribe discs like i do my photo paper and not let any direct light get to them?.  </s>
<s> thanks wayne  </s>
<s> you can ask google that but my well cared for cdr don't go bad after 5 years so far.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i think i will just buy some new lightscribe discs and keep them in a nice dark place.  </s>
<s> wayne  </s>
<s> and it works (well, i played a dvd rom game on it but haven't burned anything yet) great! it was perfect for my system.  </s>
<s> thank you all again.  </s>
<s> it was certainly a new experience replacing a cd player with a dvd burner.  </s>
<s> i'm learning all kinds of things these days.  </s>
<s> funny thing is, i was a little hesitant about buying an off-brand, but when i pulled the cd player out of my dell, it was a lite-on model as well!  </s>
