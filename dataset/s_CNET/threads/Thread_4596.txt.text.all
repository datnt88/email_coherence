<s> hi all just got the netgear - rangemax dual-band wireless-n and set it up (no issues setting it up, in fact surprisingly easy)and it is set to dual band (2.4 & 5ghz).  </s>
<s> house has concrete walls (i know this can mess with the signal) question is.  </s>
<s> i get an excellent signal with the 2.4ghz wifi (in the room where i need the laptop working), but the 5ghz signal is not that great.  </s>
<s> any thoughts?  </s>
<s> the absorption of the signal does vary with the frequency.  </s>
<s> it would take a boatload or equipment to measure this but you should... go with what works best.  </s>

<s> i am ok with the 2.4ghz, i was just wondering.  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply  </s>
<s> on page 15 or so you see the range of 5.8ghz to be noted at 200 feet.  </s>
<s> the 802.11g 2.4ghz is in the next section and is noted to be 300 feet.  </s>
<s> again the issue here is all about what's in between and what frequencies are absorbed and by how much.  </s>
