bob, how do you boot from an external hard drive? i made a system backup and put it on an external hard drive but when i tried to use it and would not restore because drive c was in use.
we are booting linux from the usb drive. windows is not in use here. bob

microsoft does not provide a means to run windows 2003 from an usb or firewire connected drive. don't waste anyone's time with this.
