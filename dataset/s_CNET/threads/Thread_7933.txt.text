i'm looking at a used macbook pro (2.2ghz) from local seller - original owner does not have applecare and 1 year purchase warranty will expire in a few months. a couple of questions: 1) as a second owner, can i still buy ac for this macbook pro? 2) owner has installed an extra 2 gigs of ram himself - does this void the warranty or a potential ac warranty? 3) does the 3 year coverage start when i buy ac or when the macbook was originally purchased? condition of macbook is otherwise good except for normal wear and tear and scratches. thanks for the help.
aversion to risk or will you be upset if the costs are what they are outside of ac and will you use the support provided by ac? as to the warranty of the added ram you quickly learn to not tell them that if you want the warranty and to swap the old chips back in prior to warranty service. items 1 and 3 need to be answered by apple since they decide that. bob
1. best to see if you can get the original owner to buy it, transfer it to you, and pay them. 2. ram is a user replaceable part. does not normally impact the warranty. 3. 3 year coverage starts from the date of original purchase. terms and conditions for applecare can be found here p
