i have a lacie bigdisk and am unable to use this with time machine. this drive will not show up when i choose back up disk. am i better off just using carbon copy cloner? thanks
is it formatted as mac os x extended (journaled)? does it show up in the side bar? does disk utility see it? what version of os x are you using? p
disk util. does not see it i am using 10.5.8 it does show up in the side bar i am not sure if the disk is formated for osx. i am not sure how to check this.
disk utility does not see it? strange turn of events. with the disk mounted on the desktop, right click it and get info. you will see the format of the disk in the resulting window. for a single button mouse, hold down the control key when you click the mouse p
