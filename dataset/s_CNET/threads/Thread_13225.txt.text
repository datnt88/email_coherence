ok so im looking to purchase a 320gb western digital sata hard drive(retail - includes sata cable).. i will also be pairing this with the gigabyte ds3r p35 motherboard (has 8 sata slots).. do i need to buy some kind of adapter in order to use this sata hard drive? i'm not really knowledgable with this at all =/ what exactly can i do with a sata hard drive that gives it an advantage over the old ide style? ive been reading about people saying that you need a sata adapter and all kinds of cables in order to run a sata hard drive.. any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks
you don't need anything with an sata hdd and that mb. vapcmd
so why do i see people talking about getting a sata adapter? i dont understand why you would need a sata adapter.. what is the use of one of these? and also what are the cons to having a sata hdd compared to the old ide hdd's?
as vapcmd said you don't need on that board because it's new. people with older boards may need adaptors for the sata power connector, or a pci sata card if they don't have onboard sata connectors. there are no con's to sata hdd's, they are faster. older systems may need sata drivers on floppy disk to install xp. your board sata can be set in bios to ide mode, so you don't need to worry about the driver for xp.
think about the circumstances and options for just a moment. bet you can ... vapcmd
