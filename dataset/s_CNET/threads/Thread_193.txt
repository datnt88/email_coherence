12236	6	119412	1357225	1357036	ozos	8/12/05 11:08 am	1.12384488e12	except that	it's already known that sm3.0 is going to be a requirement of upcoming games the fp precision thing hasn't been an issue for ati, and probably won't be for a long time (i'm guessing the game will be overall too demanding/beyond the card's overall ability before the fp issue arises) but sm3.0 is going to be a part of upcoming games because it's a part of current games (half-life 2 and farcry can use it, and do use it on geforce 6 cards) my take is basically this: if your fine buying a $300-$500 card that you already know will have issues with games due to lack of feature support, go for it, just know that you have to upgrade sooner me personally, i cannot justify purchase of a $300-$600 card that won't support things i want it to support in the future i'd rather be able to play the game at the settings i like 6800gt allows that, i don't feel that if i'm spending a fair deal of my hard earned money that i should have to compromise just to say i have a different brand or to get 2-3% higher in a benchmark
