<s> i have a nick in the protective coding on my monitor's screen.  </s>
<s> its in a really annoying place and often inturrupts my work. the screen is a mitusbishi diamond pro 900u. is there a way to fix this?  </s>
<s> i know there is a type of chemical you can drop on the casing that turns a small area of plastic into a moldable clay-like material that later hardens as it dries, and products that repair cd's using a chemical.  </s>
<s> there must be something i can buy that can fix this.  </s>
<s> does anyone know of such a product?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance, dave  </s>
<s> you can find such at automotive repair part places.  </s>
<s> but it's ymmv if you'll be happy.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> still, i don't know what im looking for, and those sales people who work at those places can never answer anything but very simple questions like &quot;what brands of tires do you carry?&quot;, at least thats what its like here.  </s>
<s> what would i be looking for?  </s>
<s> keep in mind, this isn't glass im repairing, this is a laminate like protective coating on the glass.  </s>
<s> ive seen those glass repair kits, and those don't hide damage, they just seal it and keep cracks from spreading, which isn't my problem.  </s>
<s> also, how unsure are you about this advice?  </s>
<s> (&quot;ymmv&quot;)  </s>
<s> the goop is as you suspect. it will not hide the problem and the visual aspect may still be noticeable.  </s>
<s> there's no magic here.  </s>
<s> it's optics... let me dive off into optics for a second and use google if a phrase sounds foriegn. the refraction index of the repair material will not match the underlying material.  </s>
<s> as there isn't a match, the repair will not be perfect.  </s>
<s> but it could be better than no repair.  </s>
<s> i offer this suggestion with the best intent and if you expect a perfect repair, you'll have to keep looking.  </s>
<s> best of luck, bob  </s>
<s> hi dave, i've just read your email re: scratch on your diamond pro 900.  </s>
<s> i've got a mitsubishi diamond plus 91 with the same problem - an annoying little dent on the screen surface.  </s>
<s> what's needed is something which dries in the dent to the same refractive index as the surrounding surface material.  </s>
<s> did you find anything which helped?  </s>
<s> thanks michael k-s michael.kirk-smith@ntlworld.com  </s>
<s> if you want a good result try something thats used to remove scratchs from eyeglasses as that has to be about perfect.years  </s>
<s> ago i had bad scratches on motorcycle windshield.a  </s>
<s> guy i knew who worked at grinding and repairing lens gave me a liquid that i used with a buff pad on my drill and it did a perfect job.seen  </s>
<s> different things on tv since should do same thing.  </s>
<s> interesting. have you any product names?  </s>
<s> i'm in ireland but i could get friends in the usa to send/bring something over.  </s>
<s> thanks, michael  </s>
<s> or  </s>
<s> hey have you guys seen the product they sell for repairing scratches in prescription glasses?  </s>
<s> i have seen it advertised on tv here in the us and think i have seen it for sale in a national drug store chain.  </s>
<s> dont know if it will work as i have never tried it.  </s>
<s> just thought i would throw it at you as another option for you to look at.  </s>
<s> the product is called &quot;liquid lense&quot;....here is their website, with how to order.............  </s>
<s> by the way, the &quot;liquid lense&quot; if ordered via their website, is only $9.98 and shipping is a couple bucks....not the $5.00+ some places charge.  </s>
<s> i got my shippment for $11.90......... they only ship in the usa at the moment.  </s>
<s> use the left over for sunglasses, goggles, face masks, your watch case....anything with a scratched surface.  </s>
<s> so what's the verdict?  </s>
<s> i have scratches on the film of my sony e500.  </s>
<s> i would ate to replace this 22&quot; crt.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> i dont know if this would work but its got be a lot cheaper ---- what about the glass filler they advertise for filling in the stone chips on car windscreens ( just a suggestion ) postie  </s>
<s> if it is any help i'm of to the usa (florida) next week for a fortnight back on the 12-13 feb if it is any help ???? i could try and get some for you postie  </s>
<s> ps at least it saves you postage from usa postie  </s>
