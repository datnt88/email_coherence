<s> i have an opportunity to get a brand new in box macbook c2d 1 gig ram 180 hard drive for my 5 mts old macbook pro cd 1 gig of ram, 80 hard drive.  </s>
<s> is it worth it?  </s>
<s> the pro's dedicated video should give it the boost beyond that of the non-pro.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> even though the macbook has the new core 2 duo chip and the pro has just core duo?  </s>
<s> look at what benchmarks there are out there.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i think macbook pro coreduo is still better than the macbook coreduo2.  </s>
<s> specially when it comes to graphics and overall performance.  </s>
<s> cnet.com says that the macbook c2d and macbook pro c2d have similar performance.  </s>
<s> now the pro has a core duo so the macbook c2d should have even closer performance if not equal.  </s>
<s> all this applies if you don't want graphical performance.  </s>
<s> like if you edit photos or play games and stuff then i think the pro would be better.  </s>
<s> second thing is size.  </s>
<s> which size do u prefer.  </s>
<s> if both are ok then go for what is important to you.  </s>
<s> simply put if you need graphical performance then go for the pro and if you dont then go for the macbook.  </s>
<s> i would certainly go for the pro.  </s>
