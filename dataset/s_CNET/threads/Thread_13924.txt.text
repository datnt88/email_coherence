the pc i am using now is using windows xp service edition two, and is running fine but i also have another pc i dont use. i was wondering if there was anyway i can connect the two to give more memory and make my current pc run better than it is now. im looking for more memory and maybe a faster pc. if anyone could help that would be great.
you can't make the other pos faster. you could make it server and client, but that would just be a waste of money and time. roger
a motherboard doesn't have options for hooking up other boards to it. however, if you really know your electronics, it could be a slim possibility.
i had the same dilemma a few days back, didnt know what to do with my old pc, no one wanted it for free. did some research spoke to some techs, was adviced on buying an enclosure kit which would allow me to use my old hard drives as files/media back up & my dvdrom/cdrw cud be used to copy media onto my new dvdrw in the same kit. i had one slot for memory empty on my new pc so i pushed in the old one on the other slot. looking forward to donate the motherboard, nvidia ti geforce 64mb & p4 processor. hope this helps.
