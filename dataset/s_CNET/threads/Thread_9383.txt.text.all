<s> hello, my (quite) old pc (5 years, i think) has windows me and is, of course, as crotchety as frasier's dad (and as fussy as frasier).  </s>
<s> one day, i downloaded a plethora of ms windows updates and installed them.  </s>
<s> i didn't notice any particular improvements on my pc, but one thing i immediately noticed was, upon startup, my computer goes into a very slow and choppy process, culminating with windows popping my system folder onto the desktop for all to see.  </s>
<s> aside from the obvious security issues this raises, i suspect it's played a not-insignificant role in slowing down my computer's startup sequence.  </s>
<s> does anyone know how i can tell my computer to shut that subroutine off?  </s>
<s> thanx, the wren  </s>
<s> hmm maybe try going to the control panel and opening the add remove programs and removing the update cuz im running a 733mhz with windows xp from a pc thats probably as old as your and has parts that are just mixed and matched.  </s>
<s> those windows updates dont do anything good they just slow everything down.  </s>
<s> when i would update from the site i would restart and slower than ever.  </s>
<s> but im not to familiar with the me vers of windows but its worth a shot.  </s>
<s> best bet if you're pc is that old and as of this month microsoft is not supporting wimdows 98 or me spend a little cash and buy a new pc like from walmart at 500 bucks you will get xp and a computer that will last another 5 years  </s>
<s> can you tell us the pc maker and model number (example: dell dimension 2400)?  </s>
<s> what cpu? how much memory (ram)?  </s>
<s> hard drive total size and free space?  </s>
<s> are you running any security programs?  </s>
<s> antivirus antispyware firewall  </s>
<s> more specs on the pc: hp pavilion 7950 cpu is an amd athlon processor 384 mb of ram (been upgraded twice) hard drive capacity: 55.8 gb free space: 35.4 i have an old mcafee virusscan v. 4.5.1 sp1 that i'm not sure has ever been updated.  </s>
<s> aside from that i occasionally run adaware and spybot on this thing.  </s>
<s> oh, and i tried using add/remove programs to remove any old windows updates in the hopes of extracting the offending startup sequence, but to no avail.  </s>
<s> it still shows my system folder...  </s>
<s> download avg free and run a full scan. the results will indicate any partition failures.  </s>
<s> run the windows upgrade advisor.  </s>
<s> it will tell you if you may have any hardware / software issues.  </s>
<s> tell us what you find.  </s>
<s> hello again, after running the complete scan in avg, it found about 8 trojan viruses on my computer (all are in a virus vault now).  </s>
<s> nothing mentioning a partition failure or the like.  </s>
<s> as for windows upgrade advisor... i'm not sure what this is. is it another program for me to download, or is it part of me?  </s>
<s> when i know what to do with it, i'll let you know what it tells me.  </s>
<s> best, the wren  </s>
