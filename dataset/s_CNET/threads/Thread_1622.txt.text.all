<s> i have a 2010 macbook pro computer that wirelessly connects to the internet via an apple time machine.  </s>
<s> i currently have an hp photosmart c7200 printer that i could never get to function wirelessly. is there any e-printers (multi function) scan and print that i could get to work wirelessly for all functions?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
