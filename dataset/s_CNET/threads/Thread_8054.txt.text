hello, i own a samsung galaxy tab 7.0 plus and everything was great till it went dead one day and didnt start again. the reason it didn't turn on again was that i lost my charger and the laptop charger couldn't help the battery to start. so i had to take it to a samsung maitenance point where they did a system upgrade. then my problem with the wi-fi connection started. my problem now is that i cannot connect to my home wi-fi but i can connect to my office wi-fi. mind you that i connect many devices at my houses's wi-fi connection: laptops, other mobile phones.... and they all work perfectly, except my galaxy tab. can anyone help me connect back to my house wi-fi connection please? thank you so much in advance.
i don't have any detail to work with here. we do know that hiding the ssid and more can break wifi on some devices. your post has so little detail that i can't tell if it's something we know about. to help others we have the top posts over in the cnet networking forum and a post specific to samsung devices. tell more and if you can't change the router settings, i need to know that so we can stop before we start. bob
dear bob, thank you for your reply. i would like to inform you that i don't know how to change my router settings. can you help me out with this? besides, what kind of information you require to tell you? thank you so much for your help
that's done from the router management page that you reach by typing it's url in your browsers address bar. it should be documented in the manual. in fact, it's the same as you did when you told it the wifi password you chose. some modem/router-combo's are supplied by the isp. mine didn't tell about how to do it, but it was easy to find out. how's that with you? kees
