<s> so what i want to know is will the duplicator i am looking at (startech.com usb to ide sata standalone hard drive duplicator ) duplicate my hardrive to another hardrive, then let me plug in the new hardrive and have it run like nothing ever happened.  </s>
<s> that would mean duplicating the operating system and all other programs.  </s>
<s> help appreciated.  </s>
<s> i've been using norton ghost since 2004 for this purpose.  </s>
<s> i do a system backup to an external hard drive, install the new drive, restore from the external hard drive; and it's always worked for me.  </s>
<s> this gives you the added protection of an external backup you can use to retrieve any of your files if needed.  </s>
<s> once you create a copy ... what else will you use the duplicator for ?  </s>
<s> i'd go for a software solution as it has more flexibility in terms of backup/imaging and there's no warranty to expire or duplicator parts to lose.  </s>
<s> must be a fairly new product as it's the first time i've seen it.....and didn't find an reviews on newegg either.  </s>
<s> i use acronis true image as it will duplicate a drive as well as create images of it as is now or next week or the week after.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> can't imagine why i'd need this device.  </s>
<s> so ghost backs up every thing, operating system, programs, settings for those programs and all.  </s>
<s> bit for bit.  </s>
<s> and the bios automatically recognizes the new drive?  </s>
