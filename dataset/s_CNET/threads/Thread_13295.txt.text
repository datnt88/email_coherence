hey, i was wondering if anyone could link me to a place where i can buy white data sided dvd's. the kind that dvd movies and dvd video games are printed on. thanks!
explains why some folk want white dvds. example source at  bob
i'm talking about the data side though. are we talking about the same side? because that article talked about printers and i'm pretty sure ink on the data side wouldn't be a good idea.
i'm thinking you might be thinking you want to get some of those silver white blanks that games and such are made from. however these are not &quot;recorded&quot; but pressed. here's a video about this:  can you clarify what you are looking for? bob
