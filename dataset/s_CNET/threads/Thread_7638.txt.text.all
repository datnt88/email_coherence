<s> hi, i bought a new custom computer and everything was going well, until after 1 hour of usage(after instaling windows and a few programs) the computer shuts down, and now i can't even turn it on. the motherboard led stays on but i can t get a post or a fan spining.  </s>
<s> please help pc specs: i5-3570k, asus p8z77-v,corsair 8 gb 1600 mhz ram, ocz 700w, seagate barracuda es 750 gb  </s>
<s> time to call them and ask what they want to do to fix it.  </s>
<s> it's new, custom so they should be used to such calls.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> by custom i mean i bought it by pieces and build it myself.  </s>
<s> good to know.  </s>
<s> now it's the old call the suppliers up and ask what they want back.  </s>
<s> you do take a bit of risk about such building your own machine but all the parts should be in warranty so it's a pain but you are now in the rma and swap parts till it works again phase.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the problem is most of the parts form my &quot;new&quot; pc are used including the motherboard and psu... so if it comes to that i will have a harder time trying to get my money back.  </s>
<s> just my luck...  </s>
<s> your top post lead with it being new.  </s>
<s> now it's not new but something else.  </s>
<s> it's pretty hard to diagnose as it is but when dealing with dead computers the common advice remains the same.  </s>
<s> if in warranty, use the warranty.  </s>
<s> if out of warranty you have to decide if you are going to be a pc repair tech.  </s>
<s> there are millions of posts about fixing a dead pc. basically you swap out the most suspect part.  </s>
<s> if you can't tell which part then you use the old advice of &quot;replace the cheapest part first.&quot;  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> now that we've heard more about this computer, did you happen to use an old case?  </s>
<s> if so, take out the motherboard and remove all and i do mean all standoffs that we use to mount the motherboard.  </s>
<s> now only install the ones that are needed.  </s>
<s> but first, build the pc on a chunk of cardboard.  </s>
<s> if it works there it could be that old issue with an extra standoff.  </s>
<s> i've lost count of folk that tell me it can't be this because it worked.  </s>
<s> hopefully you've been around long enough to guess why this matters.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> since this is a build of gathered used and/or some new, you need to rebuild again.  </s>
<s> as stated to you, its best to remove and build on some cardboard and check operations that way.  </s>
<s> use a household fan to cool it as added cooling.  </s>
<s> if it works for some extended period, like in hrs.  </s>
<s> then you then need to check/inspect the case as mentioned.  </s>
<s> note where standoffs are, etc. and return mtbd.  </s>
<s> alone to case.  </s>
<s> tighten screws but don't over do it and make some are grounded if plastic standoffs are used as well.  </s>
<s> understand what psu you have, is it single or dual rail type.  </s>
<s> if dual, balance the load requirements better or replace entirely.  </s>
<s> build the pc as basic as possibel and check results to see how it operates.  </s>
<s> also, just where did it fail after 1hr.  </s>
<s> how did it fail, shutdown, froze, didn't respond, still loading s/w, maybe the last action is the culprit.  </s>
<s> don't do any oc'ing if so done, return to defaults.  </s>
<s> have you updated the bios yet before any major installs, etc.? was the parts tested elsewhere or do you know its history, etc.. if you got a good deal at the time, you may now know why, it was an iffy part.  </s>
<s> in other words don't take things for granted, you now have to sort things out and test results.  </s>
<s> last, did you apply heatsink paste correctly on cpu as that can be a sign it failed when it got to be too much heat or pushed into a upper heat range.  </s>
<s> further, do all fans or cooling work as intended?  </s>
<s> you need to know your &quot;airflow&quot; as some operations may conflict.  </s>
<s> it may already bee too late if due to heat stress the weakest link finally gave in and failed.  </s>
<s> one thing i have the habit of doing is swapping the psu out, if during power-on the cpu fan just twitches or spins for a moment, then nothing.  </s>
<s> if it isn't the psu then that leaves the mtrbd., and any issues arising from operation, not good.  </s>
<s> so recheck your work as best as possible.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> thank you for the post, but i think the mobo is dead, i have tried everything you said and nothing, no post no fan spin no nothing, just a single green power led.  </s>
<s> when i tried to reset bios, the bios led started flickering not blinking.  </s>
<s> i contacted the seller and he said he would refund.  </s>
<s> when i was testing the compouter i wasnt even using a case, the mobo was on top of a anti static bag on top of a box, so that was not the issue.  </s>
