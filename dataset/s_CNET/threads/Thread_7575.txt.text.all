i have an old ibm computer in my bedroom (350 mhz pentium, 192 mb ram) that is strictly used for checking e-mail, occasional online shopping. 
considering buying a bigger monitor, leaning towards a 17 inch lcd. 
what should i look for to make sure that if i buy an lcd monitor it will be compatible with this computer? 
mostly curious about the plug-in, are lcds compatible with old analog ports? 
many lcd come with analog a analog input. 
what resultion are you currently using?

i don't have access to it right now, but i'm guessing 800x600.
