i have a large collection of family photos that i currently keep on external hard drives, but would like to store digitally online as well. does anyone have any advice on which service offers the best deal for my needs?
and picassa?
i researched this subject of photo hosting about 6 months ago; kind folks pointed me to b luemelon . if you just need to archive your photo files, breakthrough pricing for cloud storage can be found at hitachi backup . i just signed up for 250 gb, 3 years, $110 total. that's only $3 per month for 250 gb!
i see it has been a while since you posted this question, but thought i would chime in anyways. cloud computing has come a long way in the last few years and has provided some very affordable storage options for online storage of you digital assets. the self management features of your assets is now even easier than ever. please have a look at  for more details.
