does anyone still make a plain old media center extender? it seems they have morphed into stand alone pc's. thanks kb
why? in the case of my dlink unit there was no document to show how to properly encode video for playback. it's a dud unit but mp3's and internet radio do work. the xbox media center (see google.com) and the xbox 360 do have this nailed. let's see what apple rolls out soon. bob
thanks for the input, i was just reading up on the 360 box today. it looks like the way to go.
