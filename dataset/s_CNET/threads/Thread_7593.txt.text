i have misplaced the power cord to this unit. can someone please email me if they know where i can find a replacement??? got to get back into this external drive.
that should have a normal ide 80gb drive in it. look at some 30 buck drive enclosure from  and move the drive into its new home. bob
usually, shops can order parts for things they sell. kees
i have the exact same problem, best buy, pc richards etc, no one will sell this power cable, everyone says contact the manufacturer or company, well compusa went out of business in 2008 and the new tiger direct company is beyond unhelpful in trying to find parts for you - please please please let me know if you find anything im in the same boat and need info off this hard drive asap
put the drive into a new enclosure.
