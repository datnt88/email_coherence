i am having problems with dust in my computer. i have my computer on for several hours a day, and i think that it is overheating, and when i took the case of my pc, i discovered that there was a lot of dust inside, especially on the fans. does anybody know what i can do about the dust, or if there are any solutions? if you do, please let me know. thanks.
blow out all case filters, fans, heatsinks and other components with a can of compressed air. add case filters to air intake vents. purchase them or fabricate them out of any fine mesh--nylon stocking, scotchbrite pad, piece of household air filter, etc.
as another poster offered you can use some type of filter arrangement. just beware that you *have* to maintain those filters and clean them, because if those get clogged up they will be worse than just a dusted fan or so, you cut-off the airflow supply. if your system is on the floor or close to it, elevate it at least 6in. or place on stand/small table, etc. to reduce dust pick-up. if you have pets, try to reduce thier dander or understand that can attribute to the dust problem. you wil always have some dust and thus be prepared to maintain at &quot;your cleaning periods&quot; what's best for you. tada -----willy
