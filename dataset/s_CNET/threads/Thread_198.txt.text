from what i understood so far, it's the mobo that decides if there's triple channel or dual channel. with ram memory it just means you have a kit of 2 or 3 same sticks. my question is: if i buy 3 triple channel kits (9x 2gb in total) and use 4 sticks in one dual channel board and other 4 in another dual channel board, would they be running fine? ( i will sell the remaining 1 stick) or should i just buy kit with even number of sticks to be on safe side? it's these 2 kits:  this is 8gb (4x2gb), i'd buy 2 kits  this is 6gb (3x2gb), i'd buy 3 kits and sell 1 stick afterwards ps: i know one is 1600 and one 1333. the memory distribution will be 4x2gb in p5q3 and 4x2gb in p5p43td/usb3. what do you recommend? thanks for advice
the idea of these ram memory kits is that all components in it are tested to be as nearly identical as possible. this would mean that putting all three sticks from one kit and then putting a stick from another kit could have one odd stick. i've personally had no trouble with dual channel systems buying two sticks of the same pn ram rather than in kit form but, technically, that's the idea of the kit. so, popular advice would be to buy what's made for mb and do check with the mb manufacturer for ram that's been certified as compatible if you want the best results. good luck.
for the mbs they're going in ? would they be asus p5q3 and p5p43td/usb3. vapcmd
the 1333 4x2gb kit is listed in supported, the 1600 being triple channel obviously not.
and specifically .... this one.  personally if i was adding ram i'd consider 2 @ 4gb if the ram voltage was std (1.5v) and timings are tight like the gskill above. no point buying a triple channel kits with all the dual channel kits packages available. vapcmd vapcmd
