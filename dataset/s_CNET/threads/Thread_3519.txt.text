hello, my mother has an compaq presario that's a few years old. it's running windows xp pro. she called and said that the peripherals started working intermittently (monitor, keyboard, mouse), and now they don't work at all. she says that the pc turns on, but nothing else does. no lights on the keyboard, monitor doesn't come on..... does anyone know what the problem could be? i'm going to go over and try to fix it. i've done basic work on pc's like adding memory, drives... so i'm pretty comfortable &quot;getting under the hood&quot;. thanks for any help.
i bring a spare usb 2.0 pci card. be prepared.
you think it could be something wrong with the usb card? but then why wouldn't the monitor work? the monitor isn't usb.
you may have the classic dead pc. you are lucky in there are many articles on what to do. here's the link -&gt;  bob ps. i still bring my parts box.
i'm not sure that would apply, as the actual pc turns on, just nothing else. thanks for the link.
the methods used are what i use even if it's just power only. we unplug cards, etc... but if i write that method i'd just be duplicating the web contents. bob
thank you.
