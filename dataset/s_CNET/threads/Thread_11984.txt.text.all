<s> i have a canon pixma mp780 all in one, and the scanner is stuck at one end and will not move.  </s>
<s> when i try to scan or copy all i hear is loud clicking from the cables that move the scanner, and a message that says &quot;scanner error.&quot; the cable that is hooked to the scanner seems to be plugged in-i took off the right side of the printer where the motherboard is.  </s>
<s> i need this to fax and scan docs, so any help would be much appreciated.  </s>
<s> i couldn't find any discussion specifically about this failure but hope this helps you in disassembly and reassembly if you want to look inside.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> is this something that just started?  </s>
<s> you didn't mention os or computer hdwe being used.  </s>
<s> did you try uninstalling and reinstalling the software?  </s>
<s> that would be the first thing to try, assuming that nothing has been changed, hdwe, software or operating system.  </s>
