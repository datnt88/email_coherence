<s> my computer is 5 years old--p2/550--would an new soundcard (and speakers) make for better sound or is audio through a computer inherently poor?  </s>
<s> i listen to college radio (the ones that stream @ 128k), mostly, and cd's.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> your computer is quite old, it is barely worth spending money on a system that old, but, yes, you could definitely improve the sound dramatically by getting something like a soundblaster live with quad speakers and a subwoofer, the difference would be dramatic and pretty incredible if you bought good speakers.  </s>
<s> you can always use the speakers on a new system when you upgrade in the future.  </s>
<s> speakers like the cambridge soundworks run $100 or less for some pretty incredible quadraphonic sound.  </s>
<s> thanks for the advice.  </s>
<s> i bought some speakers and it improved my music quality tons.  </s>
<s> i purchased ev sonic xs the tend to be alittle expense depends on where you find them.  </s>
<s> with a 120 watt subwoffer and 2 60 watt speakers you cant go wrong.  </s>
<s> 240 watts best clear sound they can cost from 100 to 150.  </s>
<s> but bose speakers which are really small and have little base but a really really crisp sound.  </s>
<s> i have purchased both but i enjoy the ev sonic because of the power.  </s>
