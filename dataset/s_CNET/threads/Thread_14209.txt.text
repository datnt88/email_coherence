what is the best modem/router combo? i don't want to &quot;rent&quot; the current modem ($7.00 per month) i have from comcast. i want to 1. stream internet tv from the router and 2. use my laptop wirelessly for browsing the internet. i have comcast cable internet with 20/5 service. thanks for any info!
do not fall for &quot;best&quot; or that &quot;ownyourownmodem&quot; scam. just get a cable modem from the usual box store and the usual wifi n router and you're set. bob
beings you are on the comcast 20/5 it would pay you to get a d3 modem. if you are in a d3 area that will give you 4 bonded channels down. if your not now in a d3 area, you will be before long. your speeds will be more constant with the bonded channels. no more of the 6 to midnight slowdowns. they are also testing bonded channels on the upload so that will just be a matter of time. i use a motorola sb 6120 modem and a netgear wnr 3500l router and that setup works excellent doing the same thing you want to do. bestbuy carries both the modem and router.
i am looking for same. i want modem/router combo. i hate all the wires. let me know if you were about to find a unit which has modem and router
