hi, i'm having problems printing from internet explorer with the above printer. it was printing fine earlier but now only prints one page (file://c:\users\tom\appdata\local\temp\low\6qth7pfy.htm) irrespective of the web page i'm trying to print from. i've tried printing to adobe but the page that will be printed will be the above file. i cannot find the folder low nor 6qth7pfy - i've set windows to show hidden files and folder. printing from word is ok. my os is win 7 ultimate.
hi solved the issue by restarting ie.
and if it doesn't help, the next step is: reboot. kees
