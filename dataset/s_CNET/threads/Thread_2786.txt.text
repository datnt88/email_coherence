i'm looking to buy a desktop and that asus is being offered at a descent price, is the brand reliable? asus - essentio desktop / amd phenom&#8482; ii x6 processor / 8gb memory / 1tb hard drive
yes. asus is generally considered a good company. they have been around since the dawn of guis in the early 90's and have continued a good rep for customer satisfaction. the specs also seem very good.
many thanks for the info
hi, asus is the one of the best company for computer related products. i am also suggest you that if you want to buy then it is good. thank you.
in the 2011 pc mag annual pc customer satisfaction surevey, asus ranked as the second top brand, behind only apple and ahead of all others, by a fairly significant margin. chart  article
thanks for the article, i definitely feel more comfortable buying that comp
asus is a good brand. they have a reputation in making computer hardware such as motherboards, and they are one of the best at what they do. they now make computers, so i have nothing but high expectations from their computers as well. they know their stuff. i would choose an asus computer over hp/compaq, dell, acer. they are all garbage. hp and dell are so bad! source(s): i have done computer repairs for a while, hp and dell are so bad
