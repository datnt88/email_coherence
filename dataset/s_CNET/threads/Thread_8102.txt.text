i must replace the hard drive in my ibm i1412 laptop. the drive being replaced is marked &quot;ata/ide.&quot; question: must the replacement drive be ata/ide as well, or can it be ata 3, or ata 4, ultra, etc.? finding a replacement drive described as simply ata/ide has been difficult. im unable to determine if my motherboard supports any of the variant interfaces.
&quot;or can it be ata 3, or ata 4, ultra, etc.? &quot; yes. ata 4 drives work in ata 3 and before controllers. if they didn't... havoc would be thy name. bob
thanks for your reply. so, if the new drive is ide plus ata-xx, i'm in good shape? don
i thought i answered that. if the seller doesn't, i'd shop elsewhere. bob
bob, thanks very much for your input!
