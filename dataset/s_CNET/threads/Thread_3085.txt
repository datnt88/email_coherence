(its data is now backed up, of course). one was 5 months old, 250 giga, and the other was 18 months old, 160 giga. thanks to a (fairly recent) backup of the 250 giga, i've still got most of the data, though some was lost. i think it's scandalous, particularly in view of the fact that the 250 giga one was my main hdd containing win xp and all that that entails. is this normal behaviour for maxtor hdds? thanks, chalkbel.
