5467	4	298479	2796704	2796676	squirtlewa	6/21/08 5:28 pm	1.21406928e12	imac would truly be great	i really meant what i said that the 24&quot; imac would be great and match the budget with software included. fast, elegant, easy, lots of capabilities in case the users decide to expand what they do on a computer. i own a mac and like the os a lot. a $2.5k budget for typical computing needs is kinda like driving a luxury car for your commute. but i'll be honest -- whereas i drive a little hybrid, i know i'd be more comfy in a lexus or benz.
5467	5	298479	2796982	2796704	inf1n1t3	6/22/08 7:43 am	1.21412058e12	exactly	that's the way i'm looking at it squirt. for $2500, you are going to get a good computer. i could easily build a &quot;more-hardware-than-necessary&quot; with $2500 whether its apple or mac. when it comes down to it, pcs give you more bloat software when you get them that you'll end up removing anyway. (dell and hp are notorious for this, as well as sony.) apple will give you some software, but its useful. for me it comes down to aesthetics. for the money, you'll get a good computer either way you go, just make sure you have the necessary ram and hard drive space, as well as other things you may need. but for a home or office set up, the imac is just more pleasing to look at. walt mossberg has a good article comparing a dell's xps all-in-one with apple's imac. that would be where i turn if i weren't going imac and wanted an all-in-one. check it out and hope it helps! (note: mossberg has been known to have some apple favorability in the past. take that into account.)
5467	6	298479	2797577	2796982	lisa_blakey	6/23/08 7:36 am	1.21420656e12	two more questions	wow, everything you all have said has really given me some things to think about. . .maybe making it harder to choose. that being said, if you took away how &quot;pretty&quot; the macs are, dollar for dollar, which one is better and gives you more value for your money? also, if i did go with a mac, how easy is it to move information and files from a pc to a mac? for those who asked what games i play: sims2 and soon to play spore. thanks to all who have answered so far
5467	7	298479	2797611	2797577	electronista	6/23/08 8:04 am	1.21420824e12	performance and value	in terms of raw performance? pcs. if you're more concerned about how many frames per second you get, you can order the right pc that will be faster. however... it's not all about frame rate, especially in your case. most desktops don't have a built-in webcam, bluetooth, and wi-fi, let alone the smaller footprint. some of the systems with faster cpus actually have slower video cards, which hurts the practical performance for games. there's also the question of security software: while it's always good to be cautious, you simply don't need to run out and install antivirus software the same way you do on windows (unless you're very knowledgeable) since the mac is targeted much, much less and is generally less vulnerable. as for games: you're in luck! the sims 2 is already available for the mac (including multiple expansions), and spore will be available for the mac at about the same time as the windows version. you can already get the creature creator for mac.
5467	8	298479	2797660	2797577	squirtlewa	6/23/08 9:35 am	1.2142137e12	mac performance	strictly speaking, the mac laptops are faster than almost anything in the windows world. for desktops, the same prob'ly holds true, but mac pro aren't normal desktops. imac 24&quot; has a dual core processor at just over 3 ghz. that puts it comparable to pretty fast pre-made pcs for most tasks. i kinda wish they had a quad-core imac... i find it easy to go to/from macos to/from windows, actually easier than it's ever been. back in the 90s you had to download a lot of plugins to translate file formats. nowadays you just &quot;save as...&quot;
