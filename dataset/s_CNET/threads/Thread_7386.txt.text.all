<s> which video card is best for moderm video games: is it radeon 9200, or radeon 9600?  </s>
<s> the 9600 wins on better.  </s>
<s> that model is however bested by even more current models.  </s>
<s> let me be clear the 9200 is a value card and while better than last years cheaps, is today's value card.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i just bought ati radeon9200 128 ddr pci ( i dont have agp slot).  </s>
<s> its cheaper and work fine and have tv out option with dual monitor support.if  </s>
<s> you wantcheaper card with very good performance than go for 9200.  </s>
<s> if you have money then go for 9600 agp.  </s>
<s> he is right, 9600 is better.  </s>
<s> i don't know what games you want to play...or what processor you use, or how much ram or if you have an agp (accelerated graphics port) on your motherboard.  </s>
<s> but all of that aside.  </s>
<s> if i were you, looking for a relativley inexpensive soulution to play modern video games (i'm assuming games such as unreal 2004, half-life counterstrike, half-life 2, hitman: contracts, halo etc..etc..etc..) i would splurge on something like the radeon 9800pro 128mb.  </s>
<s> you might ask why?  </s>
<s> here is why the radeon 9600xt (top of the 9600 line, above pro) costs around $150-$240 ($240 is for aiw) the msi rx9800pro (radeon 9800pro) costs $195.99 to explain this more to you, the radeon 9800 pro is one of the best cards you can buy.  </s>
<s> it will perform just like its $400 big brother the radeon 9800xt, and it can double the performance of the 9600. the 9200 for modern video games basicly isn't an option, it runs like a geforce fx 5200, they are budget cards designed for some gaming, but more for basic computing.  </s>
<s> if you would specify if you have an agp that would be very nice.  </s>
<s> also how big is your psu (power supply unit) the 9800pro needs either 300w or 350w minimum, i know its somewhere in there.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>
<s> can check other games for performance there.  </s>
