<s> running off a laptop now, i am upgrading to a desktop (the first in years), and i am wanting to use a separate video card in conjunction with the existing video card already existing on the tower i plan to upgrade to.  </s>
<s> can someone lend me a hand with this?  </s>
<s> tower: card:  </s>
<s> if you want the two cards to work together or entirely separately.  </s>
<s> if you're wanting something like crossfire, i believe you need cards with matching chipsets, ram amounts, etc. someone here is probably going to say that you might want to move up to larger ps as well.  </s>
<s> in any event, tell what sort of a hand you're looking for and you'll probably get a better response than mine.  </s>
<s> if the seller is not answering a pre-sales question imagine if you really needed help!  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i agree with bob, the best thing is to ask them question before buying to determine who your buying from.  </s>
<s> you can go to cyberpower site and and ask questions.  </s>
<s> a word of caution, i have never bought from these folks, i have heard good things about them and i have heard really bad things about them.  </s>
<s> do some research and check out who ever you buy from.  </s>
