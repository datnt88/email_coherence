hello again. i have the 3c905c-tx-m lan card but i can't find windows vista 32/64bit drivers over the internet. if anybody has this card could you please tell me where can i download drivers for vista? thanks.
has the support numbers in the last chapters. bob
the 3c905c line went end of life back in 2002. you might find some generic drivers, but i recommend you get a new nic from dlink or netgear for $30 or less.
