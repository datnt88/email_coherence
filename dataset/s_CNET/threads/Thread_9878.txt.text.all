<s> i have a old &quot;thumb drive trek&quot; it is about 4 years old and i cannot use it without driver installation.  </s>
<s> i cannot use this drive with any other computers without installation the driver it is very inconvenient.  </s>
<s> so is there any possibility to use this thumb drive without driver?  </s>
<s> looking for your help and advice.  </s>
<s> windows xp has built-in drivers for most thumb drives, but it is possible they may not work for some particular drives.  </s>
<s> win 98 does not have such drivers built in, so you must load it yourself; and yes, you must have a driver installed.  </s>
<s> however, you only need do that once for each machine, so it should not be a big deal -- unless you are working with a lot of different systems.  </s>
<s> if xp does not support this drive, then the answer for win 98 applies.  </s>
<s> or you could get a new thumb drive that is supported; they are quite inexpensive now.  </s>
<s> hope this helps frank  </s>
<s> my os is windows xp sp 2 with latest updates.  </s>
<s> my thumbs drive is an old one so it is the cause of this problem i think.i  </s>
<s> have checked their website also but they have only the new products and cannot find any solution of my old thumbs drive.  </s>
<s> i think it is time to change a new one.  </s>
