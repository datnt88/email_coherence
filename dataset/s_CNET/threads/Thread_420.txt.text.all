<s> i bought a desktop 8 monthes ago and have had troubles ever since.  </s>
<s> here's a list of the specs inte lpentium 4 3.0e ghz/1mb cache/800fsb/0.09u/s478/prescott 1 gb kit ddr pc3200 400mhz kingston seagate 120g 7200rpm ata-100 8m cache dvd rw creative sound blaster audigy d-link dsl-10cf gigabyte/generic usb 2.0 port pci card sapphire 9600xt vivo/dvi/tv-out 256mb video card gigabyte ga-8ig1000 plus the usual desktop stuff. is there anyting in this list that just isn't supposed to go together?  </s>
<s> and if so, what do i need to have a working system?  </s>
<s> thanks tess  </s>
<s> what seems to be the problem?  </s>
<s> things that might be the issue: 1) power supply probably is crap, and not providing enough juice 2) cooling, prescott's are hot chips 3) the ram and the motherboard may not &quot;get along&quot; (some motherboards/ram combinations just don't work, i have no idea why, it just is the way it is, and iirc kingston is one of compaines with the most problems)  </s>
<s> well... where do i start?  </s>
<s> first a deep throat trojan wiped out my mother board so i got it replaced with the same again and the computer worked for about a week.  </s>
<s> then the power supply died and i think they put a better one in for me (tho i never got a new invoice so i have no idea) after that it was just disc drive errors hard disc errors read errors you name it.  </s>
<s> tho i'm pretty imcompetant when it comes to computers so i don't know what any of it means.  </s>
<s> don't know if that helps.  </s>
<s> it's in repairs again, but i'm trying to get my money back cos it's too much hassle.  </s>
<s> i'm just trying to see if the company gave me a crappy system to begin with.  </s>
<s> cheers for your time tess  </s>
