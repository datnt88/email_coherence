<s> i have a fairly lower end gaming setup consisting of an fx-4100, gtx 650ti, 550w xfx psu, and a gigabyte ga-78lmt-s2 mobo.  </s>
<s> i have the graphics card connected to my 23&quot; 1080p asus monitor.  </s>
<s> i would like to connect my computer to my 720p tv for throwing a video/movie on every now and again.  </s>
<s> this way, i will not have to sit at my desk to watch videos/movies.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure whether connecting my tv to the graphics card as a second monitor will lower my gaming performance or not.  </s>
<s> i also have the gt 610 that i upgraded from in the closet that i believe i could connect, and use for the second monitor, as well.  </s>
<s> i need some suggestions/advice on how i should connect my tv to my desktop in order to get the best performance and usability out of it.  </s>
<s> and yes, gaming performance will drop if you play movies at the same time.  </s>
<s> i hope we are not going to repeat the discussion why.  </s>

<s> i was never planning on doing both at the same time, i will just keep the tv plugged in but only switch it to the hdmi source whenever i need to play a movie or video on it.  </s>
<s> thanks for replying.  </s>
<s> is that it should not matter if the connection is there or not.  </s>
<s> however we have reality and with some million different pcs you can't state it will or will not matter.  </s>
<s> we know that folk have tried to play a movie and game at the same time so i commented on that result.  </s>
<s> as to it simply being plugged in, you'll have to test what happens.  </s>
<s> should not matter but as you suspect, it might matter.  </s>
