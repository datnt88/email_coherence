hey folks just wanted to know if there are dedicated usb servers? i'm not sure if that's what they are called but basically i am looking to hook up a couple of external hard drives to a wireless network. i also plan on attaching a printer as well. i have found dedicated printer servers, but haven't been able to find just a usb one. i know of a couple wireless routers that have usb ports built in but that will be a last resort. thanks for your help.
i can share printer servers and (usb) drive servers but so far there are not many &quot;usb&quot; servers. there are reasons why but why not get what you need? bob
alright. i guess it was all wishful thinking. thanks for your help.
here  here  here is a link with multiple products  i just did a google search for 'usb server' and pick a few links that came up. bruce.
