<s> just announced, 1.5 tb drive.  </s>
<s> mtfh  </s>
<s> uhhhhh probably the twelfth of never.  </s>
<s> exceeds the usable life of the average pc.  </s>
<s> thats a lot of space i know this is just a 3.5&quot; hdd for home computers but how does websites like rapidshare.com host content equalling petabyets!  </s>
<s> let us hope -- never! with the impending arrival of holographic storage, blu ray will look like a 3 1/2&quot; floppy!  </s>
<s> content host sites most likely use drive arrays.  </s>
<s> this involves taking several drives and making one logical drive out of them. the amount of data to be stored is dependent on the type of array used.  </s>
<s> look up &quot;raid arrays&quot; if you wanna know more!  </s>
<s> while it appears at first the limit was in the petabyte area a nice article given that we see over 1.0tb today, that new limit appears to be something most of us will encounter.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> lol,slackers.... other than video,i can't imagine what someone would want/need with that much space!  </s>
<s> let's say you were a dictator...  </s>
<s> recall the &quot;monolith&quot; in the movie 2001.  </s>
<s> well, that's a storage module of the most immense kind, and where was it put, the moon.  </s>
<s> it was &quot;earth's server&quot; so when activated it became alive with data.  </s>
<s> it could happen... anywhere data needs to be stored/saved and retrieved is a place it has to be found.  </s>
<s> ever since data has been gathered its been put somewhere and the &quot;media&quot; has changed but not the purpose. the retrieval for whatever reason suits some task or need.  </s>
<s> as they say, &quot;its not over until the fat lady sings&quot;.  </s>
<s> that means gathering so much data, you'll know when an ant farts.  </s>
<s> why, anyone would want to know, it yet another question.  </s>
<s> adios -----willy  </s>
