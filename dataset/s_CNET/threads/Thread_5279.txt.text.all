i don't know what the proper terminology is, but the router is &quot;sending&quot; multiple mac addresses to my isp. 
let me explain: i can log only one mac address at time. 
so i changed my mac address of the router to match that of the computer so that the isp connection would be 'fooled' into thinking it was the same machine. 
however, after i use the internet through the router for a few minutes, my connection is terminating because my 'port has multiple mac addresses.' i can try using it as an access point, but i have trouble establishing an ip. (the isp already has dchp) help!! this is weird.... 
of the mac address. 
if not you should turn it off. 
could having duplicate macs cause things to run askew? 
had the same name and street address, where would your mail go? 
haha nice metaphor!! i'm going to try it, i thought you are right, i never thought of it that way....thanks a lot!
