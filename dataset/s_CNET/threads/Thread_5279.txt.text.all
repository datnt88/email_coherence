<s> i don't know what the proper terminology is, but the router is &quot;sending&quot; multiple mac addresses to my isp.  </s>
<s> let me explain: i can log only one mac address at time.  </s>
<s> so i changed my mac address of the router to match that of the computer so that the isp connection would be 'fooled' into thinking it was the same machine.  </s>
<s> however, after i use the internet through the router for a few minutes, my connection is terminating because my 'port has multiple mac addresses.' i can try using it as an access point, but i have trouble establishing an ip. (the isp already has dchp) help!! this is weird....  </s>
<s> of the mac address.  </s>
<s> if not you should turn it off.  </s>
<s> could having duplicate macs cause things to run askew?  </s>
<s> had the same name and street address, where would your mail go?  </s>
<s> haha nice metaphor!! i'm going to try it, i thought you are right, i never thought of it that way....thanks a lot!  </s>
