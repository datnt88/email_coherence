hi, i have read all of the specs, need some convincing on what to go with. 
in canadian $ in order: $190.99, $222.99, $124.97. 
his radeon x1600 pro iceq / 512mb gddr2 / agp 8x / dvi / vga / hdtv / video card his radeon x1650 pro iceq ii / 512mb gddr2 / agp 8x / dvi / vga / tv out / video card bfg geforce 6800 gs oc / 256mb gddr3 / agp 8x / dvi / vga / tv out / video card thanks in advance to all that will answer 
it'll play everything the 1600pro can at about the same speed. 
the 1650pro is faster but not fast enough to justify the extra expense. 
and the 512mb won't make a bit of difference with these cards. 
don't pump cash into obsolete agp technology. 
hi ramarc, i am upgrading from a ati raden 9200 se 128 mb so i will certainly see the difference. 
you are absolutely right why spend extra $$$$ when i will probably upgrade the whole system next year, pci-e needs a new mobo, mmmm a new chip mmmmm all a bunch of new goodies ..... lollllllllll thanks a million $$$$$$ again for your input, it was the kick in the butt i needed.
