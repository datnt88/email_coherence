8356	5	117561	1335632	1334786	willy	8/2/05 8:15 am	1.1229705e12	glass cleaner	use just about any &quot;glass cleaner&quot; to wipe a glassed monitor. best, to apply to cloth or rag instead of directly on monitor surface, then wipe. however, if you monitor is really a lcd type, don't do this, buy the required special wipes or cleaner for that purpose. tada -----willy
