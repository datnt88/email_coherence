just got the linksys usb network adapter. it says rj-45 network port connects to any 10/100mbps hub or switch or ethernet networking device. its not specific saying you can connect the cable directly to the modem. can you? do i really have to get a hub too?
if you mean a boardband modem, sure it can.
hi, thanks for your reply. i hooked it up but then it said it couldn't find my network address. would have had to reset each time i used the other computer, so i went out an got a router today and i'm all set. got the dinaosaur and my newer one all hooked up.
