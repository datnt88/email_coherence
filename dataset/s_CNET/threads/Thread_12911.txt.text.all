having loads of problems with above adapter have no problems with ethernet cable, so know that we have found router set the usb up finds my wireless connection get on the internet the system freezes and i have to reboot. 
using windows xp updated all drivers even usb adapter still no joy would be grateful for any help. 
netgear tech help no help 
install a pci wifi card. 
you have a netgear router? is the adapter also netgear? 
have run into compatibility issues doing mix and match with hardware even though they all claim to be cisco compatible. the prior poster does have a point, a slot card generally performs better than an adapter.
