i want to upgrade the ram memory of my dell dimension 2400. 
there is a 256mb chip in slot #1. slot #2 is empty. 
can i put in a larger ram chip in slot #2, leaving the old 256mb chip in the computer ?? or putting it another way, what's the most economical way of upgrading the ram memory of my computer?? 
visit the dell support website and locate your model#. 
there you will find 100% the details of any ram capabilities of what's what. 
-or- visit the and enter your dell info and proceed to be informed. 
while this is an easy way to get the info, the dell website is the defacto source of your system specs/details.
