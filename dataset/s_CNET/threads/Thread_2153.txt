(this is probably ok as is) bf = the pxe boot file (this is probably ok as is) for further help: man bootpd; man bootptab and also found in the etc/bootptab file itself as comments. if you don't know the hardware address, or which ip address the dhcp server of the router will assign, start the client machine. make sure its bios is set to boot first from its network adapter. you should then be able to get the hardware mac address as it attempts to boot via the network adapter. update /etc/bootptab on the bootp server with the client's mac address and the ip address for it as set in the dhcp server (eg in the router), then restart bootpd. start bootp: here is a wrapper to start and stop bootpd from the command line. vdaemon=bootpd vcd=/var/lib/tftpboot start () { echo -n &quot;starting $vdaemon: default current directory is at $vcd ... :&quot; /usr/sbin/$vdaemon -d 4 -c $vcd &gt;/tmp/$vdaemon.log 2&gt;/tmp/$vdaemon.err & sleep 1 status } stop () { echo &quot;stopping $vdaemon ...&quot; kill `pidof $vdaemon` } reload () { if [ &quot;`pidof $vdaemon`&quot; ] ; then echo &quot;reloading config file for $vdaemon ...&quot; kill -hup &quot;`pidof $vdaemon`&quot; fi status } status () { vpid=&quot;`pidof $vdaemon`&quot; if [ &quot;$vpid&quot; ] ; then echo &quot;$vdaemon running, pid=$vpid&quot; else echo &quot;$vdaemon not running&quot; fi } case &quot;$1&quot; in start) start ;; stop) stop ;; reload) reload ;; restart) stop ; sleep 2; start ;; status) status ;; &quot;&quot;|*) echo `basename $0` parameter: start stop status reload or restart ;; esac preparing files for tftp net booting, section &quot;setting up bootp server&quot; has more info on bootp, including instructions for starting bootp using the inetd alternative. configure the tftp server: install tftpd-hpa. its config in /etc/default/tftpd-hpa should be run_daemon=&quot;yes&quot; options=&quot;-l -s /var/lib/tftpboot&quot; the -s parameter is your tftp server file root. download the netboot installer tarfile from the ubuntu archives (karmic, jaunty), and extract its contents into the tftpboot server file root as per above.
