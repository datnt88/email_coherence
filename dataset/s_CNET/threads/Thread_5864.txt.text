how can somebody define energy consumption of a network theoritically?
can you give an example of where you found such a calculation or definition? and what it was used for? kees
i simulated bittorrent using peersim simulator and now i want to get the energy consumption, in order to make it more efficient. if i want to measure the energy consumption of a network, what information do i need to sum? thanks for the fast interest!
