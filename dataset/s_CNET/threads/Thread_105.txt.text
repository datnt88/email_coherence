hello, i have an hp vectra vl 400 desktop running a piii 866mhz socket 370 with 133 fsb on an intel 815 chipset. can i upgrade to a piii 1ghz socket 370 with 133 fsb? are there any compatibility issues and will i need to upgrade anything else (bios...) thank you
i would think the little bit of difference in processor size would be hardly noticable. perhaps a ram increase would be of more help.
check the hp & intel web sites for info on upgrades. intel mb can be very cpu specfic. if what you findout looks good for a upgrade then go to ebay. john
