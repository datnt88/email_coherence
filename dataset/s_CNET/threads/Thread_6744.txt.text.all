<s> i am looking to buy this monitor. is it good?  </s>
<s> do you recommend it?  </s>
<s> what is good/bad about it?  </s>
<s> thanks for the help!  </s>
<s> 1. see it in person.  </s>
<s> 2. see if the out of warranty gateway experience bothers you.  </s>
<s> read for examples.  </s>
<s> it is a o.k. monitor. the only reason people buy it is that it is one of the few 24&quot; computer monitors that has a 4 port hub and rca (analog for game stations, vcr play back etc...) what hurts it is that the contrast ratio is only 1000 and has only a 1 year warranty.  </s>
<s> find a good samsung or lg 24&quot; and you will find a minimum of 3000 contrast ratio and a 3 year warranty.  </s>
<s> you have to determine if the extra hook-ups are important to you. the new hd 2401 doesn't have the same hook-ups!  </s>
<s> i own the monitor and i love it.  </s>
<s> &quot; e'cept it is not a 30&quot;.  </s>
<s> the contrast ratio stated is 1000:1 - all i know is it is bright, (i'm running it at about 38% and it is still very bright with very deep blacks).  </s>
<s> it also has hdmi, dvi, vga, component, s-video, & composite inputs, along with digital sound output from the hdmi source(for the optional sound bar), & the sound bar has analogue and digital audio inputs. the screen has a max of 1920 x 1200 pixels per inch w/ faroudja video up-converting circuit, and 3ms response time.  </s>
<s> it shows 1080p easy.  </s>
<s> it pivots from landscape to portrait mode, and can rise up and down about 3&quot;.  </s>
<s> you can power it on without turning on your computer, to watch a external source (dvd player, video feed, camera feed).  </s>
<s> i bought mine from hsn&gt;$899.99 + tax/shipping, with a 1.6 gb pentium dual-core, 250 gig hd, dvd burner, vista...and it runs like a top! they still have that same priced deal with a 320 gig hd. gateway sells it by itself for $499.99, but check the tax/shipping/insurance costs, cause when i ordered, if i had gotten it thru them it would have cost me $750.00 delivered&gt; so the package was only $200.00 more with the computer.  </s>
<s> in the stores, at the time, it was going for up to $799.99 by itself! it has beautiful color, and i'm very happy with mine. the only things it lacks is a built in sd/hd tuner, or a remote.  </s>
<s> i've 2 dvd recorders w/ built-in tuners and remotes so that is not a problem.  </s>
<s> soon to get a hd tuner w/hdmi.  </s>
<s> this thing is a beauty!!! and i do'nt work for or sell for gateway.  </s>
