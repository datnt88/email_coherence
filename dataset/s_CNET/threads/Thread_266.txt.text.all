<s> hi, i'm looking for an external hard disk with a lan port on it so i can have it as a network location as opposed to connected by usb or firewire.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> while a great idea for some lans, the speed drop from usb 2.0 480mbps to 100mbps could have the owners screaming &quot;what's taking so long.&quot; buffalo makes a few such units so take a look there.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i am wanting to get three of the devices, one of backing up to, another for mirroring that back up across town and the last one to keep junk on that i need on both my notebook and networks.  </s>
<s> usb 2 means that a computer needs to be switched on to access it and while most of the time the computer is on, sometimes people like to save the environment.  </s>
