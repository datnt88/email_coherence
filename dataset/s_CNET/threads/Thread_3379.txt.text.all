<s> looking at some budget psu's and came across a hec hp585d.  </s>
<s> anybody had any luck with these?  </s>
<s> i'm not putting too much of a load on my system at all, but cannot get by with my tiny 250w.  </s>
<s> how are you measuring 'the load' ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> you gave no details of your system.  </s>
<s> however, if you have an oem type such as dell, hp, etc., then what's installed is considered capable for your needs.  </s>
<s> they have determined its enough.  </s>
<s> but, once you add or install other devices, then yes you start to tax the psu.  </s>
<s> even so, unless you really stuff the system it helps to upgrade the psu.  </s>
<s> however, its been my strong advice, don't settle for cheap.  </s>
<s> cheap is cheap and it will falter in time and when it does it makes for a bigger problem than a poor psu, if you're unlucky.  </s>
<s> calculate your needs then add 100w to it just to be safe, even with a cheap psu.  </s>
<s> here is a link for a calculator: -or- google for another psu calculator of your wattage needs.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
