hey friend, i have lost my bsnl dataone adsl modem (utstarcom ut 300r2u) installation cd. two days back i have reformatted my computer harddisk and learned that i have lost my modem installation cd without which i will not be able to connect to internet. so anyone having the same model bsnl modem please do sent me the usb driver installation software. once again the model no: ut 300r2u manufacturer: utstarcom i have even searched the manufacturers webpages. it was not helpful and had even approached the customer center, which was of no use. i am in a critical situation. please help me. reply on reach.anupprasad@gmail.com thankyou. anup.
are you saying your isp can't/won't provide the software for you to connect to their service??? why did you go to the modem mfr instead of the isp?
hi anup, here are your drivers:   please help others with the same problem because mtnl is giving no support on this matter. all the best
