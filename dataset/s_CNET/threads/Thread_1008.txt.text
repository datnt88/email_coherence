i have just recently installed windows xp pro on one of my computers. i cannot connect to other computers on my network. i have run the network setup wizard many times, and the computer is on the same workgroup as the others. also, i cannot access the internet. the version of windows i installed did not include sp 1 or 2. the network adapter is 3com etherlink xl 10/100 pci for comple pc management nic (3c905c-tx), according to device manager. system specs: amd k6-2 300mhz 128mb ram ati rage 128 pro 4gb hdd w/ windows 40gb hdd extra storage
normally i find that reinstalling the network card driver solves that problem. look for the latest version out there. i'd advise you to restart the other computers you have on your network (don't ask why!). hopefully you should get some network connectivity. if the other comp's are ok then don't update their drivers!
try run&gt; cmd &gt; ipconfig /release then in cmd do a ipconfig /renew if you have limited access then try to change your proxy settings to automatically detect.
uninstall your anti-spyware programs.
i was trying to access the internet on one of my other computers, and i couldn't. i then noticed on the computer that was having problems connecting to the network said there is an ip conflict. i shut down that computer and the internet worked fine on the other. so, to fix this do i just do ipconfig/renew?
thanks, it was an ip conflict, i had to change my ip address because it conflicted with the ip of another of my computers. i currently have both computers running and the internet and network works fine now. thanks for the help.
