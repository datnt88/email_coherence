<s> i currently use a netgear wgt624 108mb wireless router and associated pci card.  </s>
<s> i am using wpa-psk network auth, and aes encryption.  </s>
<s> my question is; with the network ssid brodcast turned off, can any one using a scanner even see my network?  </s>
<s> thanks, ~jdk  </s>
<s> new wifi hack tools now get the ssid just by listening to other packets.  </s>
<s> since some systems start &quot;dropping wifi&quot; when this is off, my advice is as noted in our forum note.  </s>
<s> this is dated advice (turning ssid off) and it's time this information was updated.  </s>

<s> thank you bob.  </s>
