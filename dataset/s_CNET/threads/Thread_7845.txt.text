i'd like to transfer all my old vcr tapes and 8mm tapes to dvd. i'm looking to buy a new computer that can handle all that video editing can do. i'm looking at an hp pavilion a6750y. phenom 2.3gz quad core processer, 8gb od ram, 750 gb hard drive. i'll be uploading with a pinnacle dazzle recorder thru a usb. will this machine let me get the job done. any suggestions?? trying to stay under $1000.00 thanks bobmj14120
and after a few tapes i declared &quot;this is nuts!&quot; i went and bought a simple 55 buck dvd recorder, connected it to my vcr, popped in the blank dvd+r, a tape, pressed play then record on the respective boxes and came back in 2 hours to retrieve the finished dvd. feel free to repeat the lesson i learned. bob
sounds like youre adding another step since youd then have to copy the dvds to your hard drive to edit them, vs capturing straight to the computer
i have a quad core and dazzle as well and can copy from a camcorder and play a game at the same time
only those that have done such things will understand i fear. when you use the computer as the capture you can count on about 4 hours of computer work for each hour of dvd video. i'm sharing my lesson learned and a cheap fast economical solution. bob
dazzle records to mpeg2, which is the dvd format. you can either burn to dvd from the capture, or edit it
if you want to reply to the original poster, do that. but i've btdt and will share it's too much work. bob
buy a rig with a phenom ii or core i7 depending on your video editing software, you might be able to offload work to the graphics card, if your software does that, it would be a good investment to buy a good graphics card like a radeon hd 48x0 or geforce gtx 2xx
