<s> need a new pc. for personal & business & to do graphics.  </s>
<s> read reviews on different companies & customer support.  </s>
<s> they say apple is the best, but not sure if i want to learn the curve of using mac, but customer support is so important.  </s>
<s> any recommendations on a great pc and great customer support.  </s>
<s> thank you for any input  </s>
<s> while i think the learning curve is no worse than windows xp to vista or 7 can you write specifically what support you are expecting?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> support is critical now and as in the past.  </s>
<s> however, while some users expect all support to come from the vendor as an endless supply should be wary as that has it plus and minus side.  </s>
<s> maker support is limited and in general resolves typical h/w and/or some s/w issues.  </s>
<s> don't expect them to cure all ills if you don't do some of the precautionary methods to help keep yourself from pc ills.  </s>
<s> in other words, if the pc crashes, you're in for a long wait or haul to fix.  </s>
<s> if you like, check out &quot;local shops&quot; that supply various levels of support.  </s>
<s> these of course are outside any vendor support and costs extra.  </s>
<s> of course, you can use the typical vendor support until it expires and then move on.  </s>
<s> i mention this as only in a &quot;business sense&quot; it pays for itself, if anything you should have a quicker response and/or help &quot;on-site&quot; to resolve troubles.  </s>
<s> as for apple vs. ibm, pick one you feel bests serves your purpose.  </s>
<s> i can't quell on real evidence here, but overall i don't see apple as leaps and bounds better than any ibm vendor, though i certainly don't like &quot;off shore support&quot; as that alone has caused many a frustration end-user for repair.  </s>
