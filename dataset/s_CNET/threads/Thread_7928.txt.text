i have tried to get into my computer, however when i switch it on, the microsoft windows xp professional comes up and i press enter, but, an error screen flashes on and then it goes back to the microsoft windows xp professional menu again. so, i created another partition on my computer with the basics and it works fine. trying to access my disk drive and it comes up &quot;access is denied&quot;tried to restoring, but, that failed. any suggestions, thanks?
xp take ownership.
thanks, but, that doesn't work either. when i try to go in safe mode, it kicks me back to the os menu again.
safe mode boot failures are now a solid sign of malware damage. over in the storage forum at the top post are ways to get your files out. and a last chance. do not plug in any usb or other thing. try safe mode again. and i know what your question. can you fix safe mode boot failures? i can but on pre-installed windows i can't since they remove all the tools to fix it. we get the files out safe then reinstall the os. bob
