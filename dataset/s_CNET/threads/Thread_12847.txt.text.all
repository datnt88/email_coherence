hi all, i recently purchased (a second hand) hp lefthand p4500 machine with 12 3.5&quot; sas/sata bays. 
when i try inserting any electro-mechanical hard drives into the bays, they have a small orange light (instead of green) glowing in their respective led indicators. 
when i go into the raid configuration, i am unable to see any of the disks... i tried inserting 12 hard disks - 10 x 1 tb wd hdds and 2 x ssds and only the two ssds were recognized. the configuration of my machine is as follows: quad core amd opteron processor x 1 4 gb ddr2 ram hp smart array p400/256mb controller ilo100i can someone help me out with this please? 
i am in need of getting this san box up and running for my project completion... (i hope i am posting the question in the right forum, if not, please pardon...) thanks very much in advance. 
regards, krish 
but head to hp.com and use their chat link to see if documentation is available.

also tripped over one odd note &quot; 1.5g sata hard drives are required. 
&quot; this may explain why this unit was de-commissioned.
