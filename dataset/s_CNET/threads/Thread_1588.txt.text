my cable-company-supplied cable modem is kind of old and worn out. my wireless network is on the slow side and prone to breakdowns. is it possible that the cable modem is at fault and do you think it is worthwhile replacing the modem? thanks
yes modem can deteriorate... and newer modem certainly have something better in it. but then again... maybe your modem is not the problem... bring it to the isp (or someone who can) and ask them to check your modem condition...
need more info on your wireless setup and equipment brand.
