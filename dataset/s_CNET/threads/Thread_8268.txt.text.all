<s> i'm looking to pick up a netbook and i was wondering if anybody had any recommendations.  </s>
<s> i'm just looking for something i can get on the internet with, maybe watch some streaming videos and other light duty things and has a good touchpad.  </s>
<s> ive been recommended the asus netbooks, but when i look on amazon there are so many different ones with similar &quot;names&quot; but a few different numbers after them and the price difference is usually large.  </s>
<s> for instance: the asus eee pc 1018p-pu37-bk vrs the asus eee 1018p-bbk804.  </s>
<s> there is about a $150 difference between the two but i can quite figure out why.&lt;div&gt; can anybody help me find a good netbook.  </s>
<s> $350 give or take a little is about what id like to spend &lt;/div&gt;  </s>
<s> for in the 229 buck range you head to target/walmart and you get the usual netbook.  </s>

<s> if i can get a decent net book for $229 than that would be great.  </s>
<s> can you recommend one in particular?  </s>
<s> i am looking for a small computer i can take with me to work when i have down time on the ambulance.  </s>
<s> ill mostly use it just to cruise the internet, apply to jobs, watch streaming video, etc. i have a nice desk top computer that i use at home.  </s>
<s> i guess i could look at laptops, do they make laptops that are the size of netbooks?  </s>
<s> i really like the size and portability of the netbooks... are there any good laptops out there for $350 that you would recommend?  </s>
<s> for the usual i'd get the 229 buck unit at target and use it, pocket the bucks in savings.  </s>
<s> as to 350 buck laptops you have to keep shopping to catch the sale to get the best deals but is so similar to my hp dv6910us that it's scary.  </s>
<s> and i can write that xp in that system is really fast and usable.  </s>
