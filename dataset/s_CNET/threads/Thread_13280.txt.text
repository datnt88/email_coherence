hello, i am looking to buy the hardware for a pentium based system to build myself. this system should include components that are great for gaming. i am looking for suggestions, any at all are helpful! please include the type of pentium processor, motherboard, video card, and ram. thank you!
use an amd cpu socket 939 based system.
the person i am having it built for prefers pentium to amd, and is very stubborn on this issue. i use an amd myself, and love it.
check out amd's offerings especially the athlon 64 x2 line because it destroyed intel's &quot;dull&quot;-core cpus in cnets test, check it out for yourself:
1gb of ram- whatever fits ur budget (corsair xms, ocz, patriot, geil, kingston, etc) motherboard- asus p5wd2  processor- pentium d 920  or the 930 if it is within your budget
6800gs? or gt? or gtx?
i would suggest the 6800gs. it is about $200 and can play modern games relatively well at high settings and will last a while. the 6800gt is around $250 for a small performance boost. the 7800gtx is more like 450 usd and i dont think u would want 1/2 of the computer budget to be only the graphics card.
7800 gt is better value for a 1000 doller rig its only 90 buks more for almost 2 times the gaming pefromice
plz do your self a favor get sli nothing lower for gaming the best either the asus a8n sli delux or the asus a8n-32 sli delux
