14698	8	60293	715430	715376	r. proffitt	1/26/05 9:04 am	1.10673024e12	so my question is...	why not use hijackthis to fix that errror?

14698	13	60293	715682	715671	r. proffitt	1/26/05 10:33 am	1.10673558e12	it appears you didn't read the links.	what are we to do if you don't read the links? in short, many &quot;format&quot; then descend in the pit that is called &quot;installing windows&quot;. many don't take the inventory of what's in the machine that would have been easy before they formatted. on top of that, it's incorrect to format a xp machine. see step 5 of  and that's what i do to sidestep a possible tripping block of installing xp, 2000 and 2003. good luck, bob
14698	14	60293	715710	715682	cv4stm	1/26/05 10:46 am	1.10673636e12	ok...	i have read thru wat u said but i was also reading the booklet that came with the computer and it basically guides you through this whole thing and it looks pretty easy. it is also based on windows xp so i think it will work. i see what you are saying and putting links to but i don't completely understand what you mean because i want everything to be wiped off this computer. all the drivers and stuff that i need are on the restore disk so it isn't a big deal. i also have the disks for everything else i have installed so i am not worried there. anyway, can you just explain to me what you are talking about in the easiest terms possible.
14698	15	60293	715793	715269	cv4stm	1/26/05 11:26 am	1.10673876e12	off-topic question	i was reading in the user manual that on the back of my computer, there are 2 choices for the voltage the computer is running on, 115 volts or 230 volts. how do i know which one my computer is supposed to be running on??
14698	16	60293	715968	715710	r. proffitt	1/26/05 12:25 pm	1.1067423e12	that's more information.	in your prior posts you didn't reveal that restore cds would do this. many don't have such, format the machine and end up having to pay someone to install the os, drivers and more. if you have good restore cds, it can be simple. bob
14698	17	60293	715996	715968	cv4stm	1/26/05 12:33 pm	1.10674278e12	sorry bout that	sorry bout that, i didn't no it either and i just assumed all did. i just read it before i posted it. so, just to verify, since my restore disc has the os and drivers on it, i can just do the reformat without having to do all that other stuff that was in the links. i actually do want to back 1 thing up, nero. how would i back this up on a disc. just burn the whole thing on there or just parts of it. it is a downloaded iso version.
14698	18	60293	716000	715996	r. proffitt	1/26/05 12:37 pm	1.10674302e12	nero doesn't come in an iso version.	i just have a simple question. do you expect help with pirated software? bob

14698	20	60293	716033	716011	r. proffitt	1/26/05 1:02 pm	1.10674452e12	this is no joke.	i take a dim view of piracy. period. if you want your discussions to be locked, just cross that line. got it? bob
14698	21	60293	716167	716033	cv4stm	1/26/05 2:16 pm	1.10674896e12	sorry man	sorry, i didn't know u thought that way. anyway, this may help... i tested how my computer would run with only the original ram installed and it has worked without problems for the last 45 minutes with 35 of those being in counter strike source. it never restarted and never closed the game. i am now gonna try to do the same thing with the 512 chip and see what happens.
14698	22	60293	716310	715269	cv4stm	1/26/05 3:25 pm	1.1067531e12	i think my problem is solved	just as a test, i used the stock ram and the 512 ram by themselevs and for both, the computer has never shut down or a game closed. i think it is because the mhz difference. the crap stock 256 ram is 266 mhz and the good $150 kingston 512 ram is 400 mhz so now i will just leave the 512 in until i buy another one.
