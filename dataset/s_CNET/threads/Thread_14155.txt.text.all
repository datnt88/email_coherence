<s> i have recently bough an hp photosmart 5524 printer to use with my hp pavilion dv6 laptop.  </s>
<s> however, every time i plug the printer in my laptop immediately shuts down and gives the dreaded blue screen of death.  </s>
<s> i've posted a link to a screenshot below: any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated here is my system information: (i'm not sure exactly what people might need) [system summary] item  </s>
<s> the trip to hp resulted in a dead laptop.  </s>
<s> i'd return both products quickly and go shopping.  </s>

<s> tells about a microsoft hotfix that *might* solve the problem.  </s>
<s> but maybe it's better to contact hp customer service first and ask if it's a known problem and they have updated driver available.  </s>
