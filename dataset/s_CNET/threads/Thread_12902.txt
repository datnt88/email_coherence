5331	4	576303	5377216	5376995	xmcamnesiax	10/26/12 1:13 am	1.35121398e12	no	i said it had already been shutting off when playing games for a few days. i figured updating the drivers might fix it, but only made it worse.
5331	5	576303	5377199	5376995	xmcamnesiax	10/26/12 1:15 am	1.3512141e12	wait..	i guess i didn't clarify that actually my mistake. the problem didn't start until i moved into a new place and reinstalled bf3 and punk buster. i tried updating the drivers to see if it would fix the issue a few days later.
