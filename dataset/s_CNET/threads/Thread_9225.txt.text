but i can't answer your question &quot;will it work?&quot; here's why. i find most owners are unhappy about the state of affairs that windows is in. that is, after a decade of xp look at the amount of work required for driver installations. i can't predict if your os is in good enough shape to accept the driver cd without issue. bob
could you take a few line spaces out of your post. it causes folk to scroll needlessly.
