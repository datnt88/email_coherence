hi. i'm wondering what the difference is between cat5e cables and the cat6 variety. thanks a lot.
cat5e supports signal rates up to 200 mhz, while cat6 can support signal rates more than 3 times faster. other than their internal structures, that's about the main difference.
thanks. in terms of mega- and gigabits, how fast are these rates?
mega = million; giga = billion, more or less.
