i reside in a university residence and i own both a laptop and a desktop. there is a single network point in my room. i keep my desktop connected to this as this is where i get internet access. i want to sync both my laptop and desktop and this usually involves me unplugging the lan cable and plugging it into my laptop. i'm looking for an easier solution. can i buy a usb wifi stick for my desktop and connect simultaneously to my laptop wirelessly and the university network via cable? note both pcs have windows 7 x64.
plug it into the college connection.
for some reason the it department doesn't like it when guys attach routers to their ports. i don't need the notebook to access the net. i just want to sync it with files on my desktop. thanks though.
if so, i'd think you could add another ethernet card to the desktop and use a crossover cable for data transfer. you'd have to use static ip addressing for the laptop nic and the new nic for the desktop.
