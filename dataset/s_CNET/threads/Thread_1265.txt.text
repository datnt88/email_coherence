okay...i use youtube...i make videos and put them on youtube. and i need a good converter that can convert flv videos to avi. it must be free. completely free. i've tried alot of 'em. it also must have something like &quot;codec&quot; (it says the video must have a codec for me to import it to windows movie maker) any ideas?
ffmpeg will convert from one format/codec to another. open source.
what do you mean?
