<s> hi! so, i want to buy a wintv-pvr-250 mce so i can record me playing on my wii. the thing is i want to see the game at the same time on my tv(samsung ln-t3253h).  </s>
<s> can i plug my video card to my tv and my wii on the capture card so i can play my game normally?  </s>
<s> or is there a way i can play my game on my tv and record at the same time?  </s>
<s> os: windows xp video card: 7600 gs thank you!  </s>
<s> try these: adaptec usb 2.0 gamebridgetv avc-1410 or adaptec avc-1400 gamebridge console-to-pc usb 2.0 adapter  </s>
<s> the adaptec usb 2.0 gamebridgetv avc-1410 looks very nice, but what do i need to do if i want to play on my tv and record at the same time?  </s>
<s> they have cables and splitters galore.  </s>
<s> the video splitter cable will have one female and two male rca jacks.  </s>
<s> to record the audio, you'll need a cable with two female rca plugs which combine to 1/8&quot; mini (headphone type) jack.  </s>
<s> do you know very good splitters because i don't want to buy a bad quality one and lose video quality with it  </s>
<s> anyone?  </s>
