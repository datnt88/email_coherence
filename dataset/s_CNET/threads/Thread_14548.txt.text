hi there, i am running windows xp pro on my pc, windows vista on my laptop, and seem to be having issues regarding file sharring. file sharring has worked in the past, however i am having trouble after some recent changes. both computers are on the same network. i have installed lttd on the xp machine. when i view network map on my laptop, i am able to see my desktop connected on the network. when i go into network on my laptop however, i am not able to see the shared folders that i have on my xp machine. also to add, when i am running azureus on my desktop, i am able to see a media folder under networks on the laptop. any ideas as to why i cannot see my shared folders? thank you
did you run the network setup wizard? firewall? what &quot;recent changes&quot;?
yes. ran the network setup wizard, and set both pcs on the same workgroup. firewalls are turned off on both computers. as to recent changes, i had done a system restore a few weeks ago, and since then have not been able to share files between the two.
