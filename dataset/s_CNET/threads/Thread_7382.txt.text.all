<s> hello! i've been searching for the &quot;best&quot; cordless phone to replace the phones in my place and concluded that the new dect 6.0 phones would be the best.  </s>
<s> unfortunately, when i searched around, the only ones that i could find were: uniden (no headset jack!), ge (poor performance/design), and some unknown brand act or something like that (poorly made).  </s>
<s> may i please ask if anyone knows when and what models might be available in the usa?  </s>
<s> i've tried to look and search but can't seem to find any new information on upcoming availability!  </s>
<s> i'm sure every cordless phone maker would have several dect models out soon but there doesn't seem to be any announcements or information on that!  </s>
<s> how unusual.  </s>
<s> i need a replacement cordless phone pretty soon!  </s>
<s> thank you very much in advance!  </s>
<s> best,  </s>
<s> look up philips.  </s>
<s> but the philips dect cordless phone also doesn't have a headphone jack either - it looks like the philips one is simply a rebranded and cosmetically different one from the uniden.  </s>
<s> what's going on with all these dect phones?  </s>
<s> there doesn't seem to be many coming out!?!  </s>
<s> i have just found your answer and it has a plug for an ear piece. the model numbers are uniden dect 1060, 1060-2, 1080, 1080-2.  </s>
<s> may i please ask where you found the headset jack in the 2 uniden models you mentioned?  </s>
<s> i'm quite sure those 2 models do not have headset jacks.  </s>
<s> i just double checked yet again.  </s>
<s> please do tell.  </s>
<s> thx in advance!  </s>
