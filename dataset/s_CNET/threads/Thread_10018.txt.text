at startup i get the message file intelsdb.vxd missing - reinstall. problem is how. can anyone help, please?
that file seems to have something to do with a modem. is the file on your hd? do you have a modem? does device manager show a problem with the modem? maybe....remove the device from device manager....reboot. windows finds new hardware....and gets it all sorted.
thanks, i have tried but seem to have messed up too much. i am now trying to reinstall system. thanks again for your effort.
