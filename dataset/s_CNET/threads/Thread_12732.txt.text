hello.i am new to this so please bare with me.i just bought a new desktop that has the nvidia geforce 6150 se integrated graphics card.it has a open slot for a pci-e card.can the integrated card be upgraded? or will this card work for gaming?
you can buy a pci-express card and set it as the primary card in the bios, so that the pc will prefer the pci-e card as its video output. a 6150 will &quot;work&quot; for gaming, but is not the best choice given the plethora of cheap cards on the market that will easily outperform low-end cards from the past. - vr/z..&gt;&gt;
thanks!!
power from the psu. so make sure you check the video card power requirements before making the final purchase. otherwise you might end up forking up another $50 to $100 for a new power supply too. vapcmd
