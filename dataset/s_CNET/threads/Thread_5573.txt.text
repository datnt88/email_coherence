hi, on my desktop i have realtek ethernet card. recently os was reinstalled and diskette which had come with card was not readable. so driver was installed from download search. it worked initially, ping was successful, i was able to surf net continuously. now after a week what happens till i do not dial to connect through dsl ping is successful. but as soon as i connect to net just after opening few web pages hardly in 3 to 5 minutes ping command starts failing and i receive message &quot;request timed out&quot;. after reboot same symptom re-appears i.e. initially successful ping and then &quot;request timed out&quot; once i start surfing. what can be wrong ? [a] os ? ethernet card ? [c] any other/software conflict ? and how to resolve this ? thx in advance. -- rks
why didn't you replace the card? these are much cheaper than any tech support call.
actually the same card was functioning properly till reinstalling os. so i doubt if card is malfunctioning. that's why i asked what tests i should do to verify what is wrong in set up. thx. -- rks
remember that any tech support or shop call will cost more than this card. to test such i boot my linux cd. as to why it might not work when you installed windows the most common issue is a forgotten driver. most common forgot? motherboard driver package. i can't count the times the poor(er?) owner keep looking for the ethernet card drivers but had those already. bob
