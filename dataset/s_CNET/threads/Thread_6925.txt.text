hello hope some one can give me some help on setting up . here is what i am trying to achieve, i want the satellite receiver to be wireless. i have a i-link 9000 plus satellite reciever which has an ethernet port , where the buffalo router will be connected. (buffalo whr-hp-g300n firmware: dd-wrt v24sp2-eu-us my main router is the linksys wireless g router wrt54g2 v1.5. if anyone needs any moreinfo just let me know . modem siemens 204a gigaset
maybe the manual? my thought on this is...why would the satellite company want anyone to be able to do this wirelessly?
&quot;ethernet adapter to allow you to hook your receiver up to the internet for automatic updates.&quot; it seems that this ethernet port doesn't do much else. bob
