i have both ir and rf devices that i want to control with my ipad using it as a remote control. i have been able to replace my ir remotes but now want to be able to do away with my rf remotes as well. can someone tell me how to take the rf signals from my various remotes , and be able to channel through some device and then through my ipad then to the appliance? is it possible?
but you may have to create and build the last interface with some boards and software. unlike the ir controls which is a pure bit on software kit, this requires much more work. i find many are not ready for this work but as i have done this in the past i do have solid ideas on how to create it. however there appears to be no off the shelf system to note yet. if there is something made it would be specific to what you would control. bob
thanks bob . that is a relief. i have a home theatre where i want to operate the curtains, screen and blinds that have rf remotes. can you tell me how to do it or where i can go to have it done?
i don't know your electronics design background but if i was to build this i would cheat big time. i'd get something like a ip controlled relay box like  now i can wire up those relays to that curtain or even the rf control device. like i said, this is not for a consumer to do but for those that create stuff. bob
bob that ius a big help . ill see if anyone here can take it further. cheers
there are more boards like this but the root of this system is to get from the ipad to anything that i can make to press those buttons or to power that curtain. bob
