<s> does anyone know how to do this?  </s>
<s> i've got a p5g41t-m lx motherboard and have tried to enable wol through the bios, but can't find anything that looks like wol on the settings.  </s>
<s> any help would be hugely appreciated.  </s>
<s> incidentally, i've just been to asus' support site to try and get the answer to this question.  </s>
<s> i suspect having waded through endless webpages and been required to filling in fields upon fields of irrelevant and ridiculously technical information that they've outsourced management of their support to a direct competitor.  </s>
<s> it's a lesson in how to test the goodwill of even the most patient customer.  </s>
<s> (end of rant).  </s>
<s> creating a new thread in the asus p5g41t-m lx forums?  </s>
<s> there is only a few threads listed, so your newly created thread won't likely get lost in the shuffle  </s>
<s> hi! did you ever figure out how to enable wol on that particular motherboard?  </s>
<s> i am currently trying to do the same and i am wasting an awful lot of time... unsuccesfully.  </s>
<s> if you know how to do it i would very much appreciate your help.  </s>
<s> regards, nestor  </s>
