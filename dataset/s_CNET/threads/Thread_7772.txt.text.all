<s> i current have a printer simular to the hp photosmart c4480.  </s>
<s> i am running into an issue and the reason behind me not using it, whenever i try and print i am constantly being told that i do not have any paper in the tray.  </s>
<s> i can load it with 100 sheets of paper and this happens.  </s>
<s> i am looking for an all in one similar to the dell printers where the paper is loaded from the top in.  </s>
<s> i am not sure how good dell's printers are, i know their pc's are good.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> if the printer is over 2 years old then try the usual cleaning, read the product manuals for what they say about this (i don't duplicate that here) and then if the printer is 2 or more years old, start shopping.  </s>
<s> all consumer printers last about 2 to some years.  </s>
<s> many can't accept that.  </s>

<s> thats all fine and dandy....do you have a preference as to what brand is better over teh others?  </s>
<s> i've used them all over the years but don't bother with lexmark jet printers that you find in stores.  </s>
<s> i do prefer laser printers and &quot;office&quot; printers from hp but consumers generally don't want to go past 99 bucks so those may not be on the list.  </s>
