so my comp wont start, it was running fine the other day, i installed a new hard drive and an hour later it froze up. now it wont even boot up. i replaced the power supply, no dice. removed all components and still nothing. i thought it might be the bios battery, nope. motherboard nope, well then it had to be the cpu, nope. anyone help? when i press the power button the cpu fan moves a bit then stops. i removed the motherboard from the case and tested it that way thinking the case may be shorting it somehow, nothing. any ideas please help.
