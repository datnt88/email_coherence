<s> hi, there are some companies that have their wireless network enabled for their staff to access to the file server.  </s>
<s> what i wish to know is this.  </s>
<s> i noticed that in order for the staff to be able to use the wireless network is to put in a password.  </s>
<s> each of the staff are given a kind of password generator gadget to generate password for them.  </s>
<s> for curiosity's sake, how does this work?  </s>
<s> i mean this would be a more secure way to use wireless network in a company or other private properties.  </s>
<s> what is this system called?  </s>
<s> thank you in advance  </s>
<s> secureid token.  </s>
<s> it generates a random and changing code.  </s>
<s> when i login i must enter the current code that's displayed.  </s>
<s> occasionally it will fail and i will be asked to wait and enter the next code.  </s>
<s> i don't know what happens at the other end.  </s>
<s> i presume what i type must match what's expected.  </s>
<s> it's an it secret and they're not telling.  </s>
<s> my device isn't to access the wireless network specifically but the vpn. the device will fit on a key chain, is about two inches long and resembles a usb flash drive. is this what you mean?  </s>
<s> i had one before i retired from swbell.  </s>
<s> works exactly as you described.  </s>
<s> it generates a new six digit code every thirty seconds or so.  </s>
<s> how the remote server knows what it is is beyond me, and like you said, the it group isn't talking.  </s>
<s> but in my case it was only used for dial-up when i had my company laptop away from the office lan.  </s>
<s> mine looked like a credit card with an lcd display.  </s>
<s> after you dialed in you had to wait for the server to give you the prompt to input the code.  </s>
<s> a real pita.  </s>
