i have 2 computers both win xp, a network laser printer, and a broadband internet connection, all hooked up to a linksys befsr41 router. i had the 2 computers networked to each other but now i lost the connection between them and can't get them to find each other. however each computer can access the internet through the router. how come they can't find each other? i have run the necessary xp programs and rebooted. what could be the problem?
&quot;i had the 2 computers networked to each other but now i lost the connection between them and can't get them to find each other.&quot; since it last worked? upgrade to sp2? viral or spyware infestation? have you checked the workgroup names? done a search for computer from each computer? tried to ping each others address?
i worked on this problem for hours until i decided to do a system restore to an earlier point. that re-set whatever was wrong so i was able to connect again, however different problems arose with my internet connection. but now it seems to be working ok. so i'll go forward from this point. i just wish i knew what was wrong so i could have fixed it myself.
