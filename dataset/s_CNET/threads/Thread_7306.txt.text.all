<s> i am planning to upgrade to an amd x2 in the near future (i'm currently running on an amd 64).  </s>
<s> since the cpu is the only part of the systen that's changing, should i reinstall windows xp pro as well?  </s>
<s> or will windows just accept my new cpu and keep working?  </s>
<s> ~mtn  </s>
<s> but going from single to dual core always failed on window nt. so windows 2000 was based on nt and xp based on xp... if it doesn't boot proper i bet you'll do the repair install.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> and installed amd 64 x2 4800+ ... no issue(s) with os (wxp 64 pro).  </s>
<s> just make sure the bios is current enough to support the new processor before you switch.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> that is pretty much the exact upgrade i'm looking at.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
