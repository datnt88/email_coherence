i recently changed the settings of my ethernet adapter. i don't remember what i have done and i don't know the default values. i went to the device manager and changed the advanced settings of marvell yukon 88e8056 pci-e gigabit ethernet adapter. please tell me the default values so that i can change it back i am using windows vista service pack 2 your help will be appreciated chris christarzan@gmail.com
system restore should be able to do that.
no,, system restore was disabled at that time. can you atleast tell me if marvell yukon 88e8056 pci-e gigabit ethernet adapter belongs to yukon ii product line thanks chris
(in device manager) and reinstall not set it to default again? kees
but found this driver  i can't tell if it's in the mentioned family. only yukon can do that. i have to wonder if you don't have an older pre-vista system and have run into hardware compatibility issues. is that possible?
i found out a way.... i googled it and got it thanks chris
