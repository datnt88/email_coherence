<s> re the video card and power supply: video card selected requires 400w psu ... the psu selected is delivers up to 180w (and it's micro-atx ... micro-atx is ok if that's all the case will take...but you are not limited to micro-atx sized psus.) &quot;hardware - intel pentium 4/coretm 2 or amd athlontm /phenomtm - 1 gb or more of system memory for best performance - optical drive for software installation (cd-rom or dvd-rom drive) - a power supply that provides at least 400-watt is required.  </s>
<s> the power supply should be with a known brand and certified to conform to safety regulations.  </s>
<s> (for the list of certified power supplies, go to .)&quot; link for video card manual if you want to read it for your self.  </s>
<s> (r467zlgi)(r465ocgi)_e.pdf for a 400w or better psu: re hs fan...you don't need this ... cpu comes with hs fan for the motherboard: full size, with more slots and greater flexibility. the one you picked has gpu built in (you don't need the built in you're getting a separate video card), it will be very cramped using a micro-atx mb with a large video card and it has very limited expansion slots.  </s>
<s> vapcmd ps...it helps it include the description (you did that ok) and the web link (non provided) .. otherwise folks have to copy the part number, find the website (newegg) and paste the part number in the search block to find the product you're asking us to comment on.  </s>
<s> the links i provided take right where you need to go.  </s>
<s> thanks a ton for all the help would this power supply work because the others were a little too expensive im working with a 525 dollar spending limit heres the link i added the motherboard you suggested what would be a good 25 dollar 2nd video card  </s>
<s> the reason i had the second cpu fan was that i wanted to overclock it what would be good fan for that same with the video card the cheaper the better thank a lot bye the way  </s>
<s> ...if the budget is that tight i'd skip the internal light.  </s>
<s> you've got to start with a strong base system .. the mb, psu and ram to have everything stable and reliable.  </s>
<s> the psu you picked would be insufficient for that system ... and certainly not something that would support overclocking.  </s>
<s> it may work for a time but at some time it will become unstable and fail and you'd be replacing it.  </s>
<s> this psu delivers 400w with 30 amps on the 12v line buyer ratings: 85% 5s, 8% 4s and 80% efficiency, 100,000 hours mtbf at newegg. 3 year warranty.  </s>
<s> $39.99 after rebate. the psu delivers 480 with 16 amps on the 12v line buyer ratings: 54% 5s, 22% 4s, no efficiency reported at &gt;100,000 hours mtbf.  </s>
<s> warranty not specified.  </s>
<s> skip the separate hs fan for now... at the price, it's probably not as good at the factory original.  </s>
<s> just can't go too low on such a key component that can efficiently support your system for years.  </s>
