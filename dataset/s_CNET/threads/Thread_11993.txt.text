anyone know where i can find online information on hotwiring a serial or ps2 mouse to a apple performa 6200?
if i am not wrong, the apple performa 6200 system has an adb mouse and keyboard. its not possbile to connect an serial or ps2 mouse to this system...not sure... any other information on this would be appreciated.
best of luck finding these things. in closing, it is cheaper to find an adb mouse... bob
