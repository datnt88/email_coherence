<s> for instance our words in red write &quot;note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.&quot; this is not a support forum and no one is paid so you have to apply yourself to get the details into your posts so people don't waste replies asking for make and model, where the usb cable is plugged in, what protection software you installed, etc. since the product continues to not work you can call it defective and start the return process.  </s>
