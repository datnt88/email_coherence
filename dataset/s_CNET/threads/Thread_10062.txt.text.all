<s> some i've found specific items, but feel free to suggest otherwise if you think there's a better choice!  </s>
<s> case: zalman gs1000 motherboard: asus p6t, the only diff between this and the deluxe 2 is 12 vs 24 gb ram?  </s>
<s> cpu: intel i7, but i've heard the core 2 duo is the best?  </s>
<s> help here.. ram: around 12-18gb, what's the best quality ram for least money?  </s>
<s> hdd: around 2 tb, i'm thinking 2 seagates of 500gb each gpu: i want sli with 2 cards for starters, i was advised two nvidia gtx 280's or 285's?  </s>
<s> advice needed psu: kingwin mach 1 modular power supply - 1000-watt?  </s>
<s> monitors: two samsung 23&quot; 16:9 lcds drives: blu-ray is a must, i'd like to have burning ability but if price hits the mark, i'll cut this option for just read only accessories: quality mouse, keyboard, and 5.1 speaker set thanks in advance for any help!!  </s>
