i keep see the allwinner tablets are they any good? 
with the new kindle fire and the new google nexus at the 199 buck prices you will find tablets for sale at almost any checkout counter. 
this will be a bloodbath. 
not that i'd bother with the others.

but why paid more if you got the some thing?? why paid $100-400 more for a name? 
it missed on so many points compared to the kindle and nexus that only you could decide if that matters to you. 
me? 
no sale.
