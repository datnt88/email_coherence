<s> i need a computer for mostly word processing and web browsing.  </s>
<s> i'm considering getting a netbook and docking it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse so when i do need to carry my computer, it's not a problem.  </s>
<s> my concern is the computer performance.  </s>
<s> do netbooks get slow after some time?  </s>
<s> it's a run of the mill 8.9 inch unit.  </s>
<s> be aware that windows seems to slow over time so it's not a netbook issue.  </s>
<s> a netbook with windows 7 would fit your needs quite well.  </s>
<s> i would highly recommend getting a full size keyboard as you seem to have planned on.  </s>
<s> small keyboards= pain to type on for long periods of time.  </s>
<s> also, if you are mostly working with word like documents, it is easy to just save them online.  </s>
<s> this also makes it easier to reformat should you notice any slow downs.  </s>
<s> there is no reason any computer should slow after time if it is maintained correctly.  </s>
