hello, i have 4 laptops (3 vista and one xp), and a netgear wgr614 (it came with the virgin connection). i wanna play counterstrike by connecting all the four laptops wireless. please tell me how to connect all the laptops for gameplay. a step-by-step instruction would be very helpful as i'm not an expert with computers. thanks in advance.
air space is shared space and the impact of more than one machine on the air is just a bad idea that no one should entertain. how about 4 routers and configured like post 17 in our forum sticky? this way each machine gets it's own wifi connection all to itself! bob
ok, so are you saying that too many computers on wifi is a bad idea because of the radiation? i'm sorry if i understood it wrongly. also, if its possible, could you help me to set-up a lan with the stuff which i already have? thanks.
this is not an issue of too many users. what you may just be learning about is how wifi works. sure, what you asked can work but the gamers would grumble about ping times and the gamer with the wired connection would have the edge. i offered a solution to that. :could you help me to set-up a lan with the stuff which i already have?: sure, just do what the manuals told you to do. bob
