my laptop has a dvd burner. when i put in a cd/dvd it will recognize disc. when i put in another disc it will not recognize it. the only way to get it to read a new disc is to reboot. is this software or hardware. i have windows xp pro.
that type of behavior is what happened to my laptop burner just before it died. fortunately, i had a 3 year warranty and it died in month 35. if your's is still under warranty, call it in. otherwise, laptop burners are usually attached with a single screw on the bottom of the laptop. unscrew it, pull out the drive, and push it back in to make sure its connector is seated firmly. if that fails, a replacement drive is about $80. here's an example:  determine the drive you have now, and make sure the replacement has the same dimensions.
laptop is 6 mos. old, i have ext. warranty.
