<s> i'm wanting to sell my computer to help for funds towards a new macbook pro.  </s>
<s> so i was wondering if anyone could tell me a good estimate of what my computer might be worth.  </s>
<s> i've had the computer since september of 2007 and it has little wear and tear. the only thing i see is a small scratch on the side of the tower where i apparently scuffed it on something.  </s>
<s> i still have the factory reset disks and the original box (not expecting that to really raise the price lol).  </s>
<s> ok here are the specifications for the tower: *acer aspire t180 *amd athlon 64 processor 3800+ *genuine windows vista home basic *4gb(4 1gb sticks) of ddr2 ram (i think.. can't remember but it's good) *160gb sata hard drive, 7200 rpm *double-layer dvd-dual drive (dvd+/-rw) *nvidia geforce 6100 and nforce 405 mcp integrated graphics solution *56k modem *ps/2 style keyboard *wireless mouse (microsoft brand with software) usb speakers here are the specifications for the lcd monitor *17&quot; tft lcd *1280x1024 native resolution *500:1 contrast ratio *140 degrees viewing anle *140degrees vertical viewing angle *vga signal connector *270 cd/m(squared) brightness *8ms response time *internal power adapter *black color that's it.. i'm sorry if it's too in depth.  </s>
<s> i'm hoping maybe $250 but who knows  </s>
<s> included no os but is dual core, and no display.  </s>
<s> so try 250. the 4gb ram is nice at that price.  </s>
<s> thanks r. proffitt  </s>
