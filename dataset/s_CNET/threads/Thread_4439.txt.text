greetings, i am considering trying to do a rebuild. i have never done this before. below i have described the majors i have already. i would like suggestions on a board and processor that would fit my atx case with a sata hd. this is what graphics card : ati radeon platinum edition x850xt : sapphire : agp8x : 256 mb asus motherboard a7m266-d -- dual socket motherboard with amd 762 chipset and ddr dimm sdram ddr-256-pc2700 ram ( i got two sticks) i defanately want to use a sata hard drive antec sx1040b case -- (previously i was using a ide connection hard drive -- i want to goto satai presently have: i would not mind buying a combo board and processor. the back of my mind says im crazy for trying to do this. the other side says go for it and dont be intimidated. nascar4num9
are you trying to keep/reuse those components?
i really need suggestions on a new motherboard and processors that would go along with my existing sata hd, graphics card, and ram. my range is about 500 to 600? possibly a motherboard / processor package? thanks, nascar4num9
if you proceed with this &quot;upgrade&quot;, you'll wind up with a pc that's still behind the curve. anyway, here's an agp based mobo for $70:  and a core2duo 2.4ghz e4600 for $120:  since you're willing to spend some money, start from scratch: core2duo 3.0ghz e8400, $180:  4gb ddr2-800, $85:  ecs 9600gt/512mb, $147:  gigabyte p35 mobo, $82:  about $500 gets you a top-performing pc.
what im thinking about doing is a serious upgrade. performance wise, can i use my sata hard drive? also, on my graphics card, is this one that you would upgrade? thanks, nascar
is the case up to date to fit all new motherboards? atx..i assume so?
and the 9600gt is the best bang-for-the-buck video card. if you add a new case and power supply like the antec sonata iii below for $100, you can try to sell your old pc for $150 or get a $400 tax deduction by donating it to charity.
ok...i was able to get this old box working and install a new hard drive. news is that due to its age, my new arca sim racing game will not work....so...im going to take the challenge on. im not that up with all the hardware stuff. the gentelman that suggested the things above i think are excellent suggestions. what if i wanted to put say another 600 bucks in the deal? that would total out to 1,100? if you were in my situation, what setup would you get? also, will my existing case support the new mobo? thanks, nascar4num9
