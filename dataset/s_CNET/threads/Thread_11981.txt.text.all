<s> after years of great performance, my laptop has suddenly given out on me.  </s>
<s> one day my wifi was working and the next day, after a shut down and reboot, it stopped working.  </s>
<s> i have the latest driver and management software for my intel wireless wifi link 4965agn; and while it sees all the networks and connects, i cannot get online.  </s>
<s> i checked everything i could think of and finally think i have the problem. the ping test fails every time.  </s>
<s> any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> also, the machine is a sony vaio ar520e running vista home premium sp2.  </s>
<s> ok 2 things to need to check, 1st when your connected make sure you have a valid ip, by doing ipconfig (from the run box type &quot;cmd /k ipconfig&quot;)you will need to check with another machine on your network what ip your router uses it should look something like this connection-specific dns suffix .  </s>
<s> : link-local ipv6 address .  </s>
<s> . . . .  </s>
<s> : fe80::9574:f9ba:92cb:1777%11 ipv4 address.  </s>

<s> . . . . . . . . .  </s>
<s> : 192.168.0.100 subnet mask .  </s>
<s> . . . . . . . . . .  </s>
<s> : 255.255.255.0 default gateway .  </s>
<s> . . . . . . . .  </s>
<s> : 192.168.0.1 if youre not getting a good ip then try rebooting the router and then reboot your laptop.  </s>
<s> 2nd dns settings if youre connected and have a good ip but still cant view webpages it could be your dns settings.  </s>
<s> from the run box type &quot;cmd /k ipconfig /all&quot; and then look for your dns settings they should look something like this dns servers .  </s>
<s> . . . . . . . . . .  </s>
<s> : 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220 they can and properly will be different; you can use the dns server above.  </s>
<s> give these two things a try and see if you have any luck  </s>
<s> do you have access to a patch cable?  </s>
<s> take the one you're using for your desktop (i'm assuming you have one).  </s>
<s> connect your laptop to it.  </s>
<s> if you have internet connection, then your router (wired portion of it anyway) and your laptop is not the problem.  </s>
<s> it's only your wireless stuff that's gone kaput.  </s>
