i need to transfer docs from my ancient, but reliable quadra 700 to a new g5 imac. i've been told to use an ethernet transceiver cable. anything else i need to do to make this work? thanks
does the 700 get on the internet? you could use gmail to make a draft email then attach files. just don't send it. then on the new machine look at your gmail and copy out the attachments.
quadra has an internet connection but crashes continually -- can't seem to handle the data download. and, many of the files i need to transfer are large (graphic designer here.) i was wondering if there were any software settings i'd need to change if i went via cable.
either way the machine would crash. ok, the old fashioned way. go get a ftp server on your new mac. now ftp the files over fast. this is not to offer a course on ip addresses and networking or ftp use. bob
that you get an ethernet crossover cable and use it to connect the two macs together. on the quadra, turn on file sharing and share the quadra hard drive, allowing access to everyone, including guests. connect to that hd from the imac and suck the files off of the quadra. p
many thanks to both of you for the suggestions. now i have a better idea of how to go about this. most appreciated.
