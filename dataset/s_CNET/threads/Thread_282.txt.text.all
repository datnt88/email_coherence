<s> yes, i have the linksys wtr54gs i just got yesterday and when i plug the router into the outlet(regular home outlet), my laptop sees the router and ip of the router and all of that but it wil connect to the internet.  </s>
<s> i get the full 54mbps but no internet.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> does your internet come?  </s>
<s> free wireless internet is beginning to appear in some large cities, all others will pay a cable or dsl provider.  </s>
<s> i have dsl at home.  </s>
<s> but i thought thats what the mobile wireless router was for?  </s>
<s> for you to hook up the router in any place you have a outlet,and create a small wirleless network?  </s>
<s> the modem's ethernet port to the router's wan (internet) port via cat5 cabling.  </s>
<s> if this is your setup i would refer to the router's manual for more concise instructions.  </s>
<s> then the wireless device (laptop etc.) can be anywhere within the range.  </s>
<s> the back of the box that it came in said that if you wanted to use it just as a router you would have to hook it up with the dsl line (picture on back of the box) then the modem to the internet link port.  </s>
<s> but beside that picture it said &quot;or&quot; just plug the mobile router in, and you can get a wirless connection.  </s>
<s> i will try the dsl line today.  </s>
<s> 'as a router you would have to hook it up with the dsl line' or 'plug the mobile router in...' meaning, plug it in to the dsl line... not just any line.  </s>
<s> that wrt54gs can be use as a router only or as a wireless access point.. or as a repeater.  </s>
