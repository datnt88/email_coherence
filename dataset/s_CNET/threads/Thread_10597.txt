2368	4	200832	2155204	2154908	hercules29	8/24/06 10:03 am	1.15641378e12	webserver	well, when you run the maxtor setup program and it searches the network for the drive, it never finds it. and this is just a simple home network with a linksys router/switch and dhcp enabled. i'm assuming it has to be formatted in some fashion for the box to recognize the drive...maybe fat32?

2368	14	200832	2672691	2665306	blindsight	1/7/08 7:52 am	1.19969232e12	hope this helps a bit.	the drive uses the reiserfs format. it's a linux based filesystem and please, under no circumstances, try to use it under a windows environment (as in hooking the drive directly to the ide connector). windows will attempt the read and after failing ~255 times, for reasons unknown, it does something to the first couple of sectors of the drive that renders it unreadable once you replace the drive in it's housing. you must use a *nix based system to reformat the drive, and then reinstall the drive. hope this helps a little.
