a work colleague just told me this. his mother purchased a dell notebook a few months ago and it would not start this morning. she rang dell cs number and was answered by a person with indian accent. he was talking fast and hard to understand. after a few minutes, he told the lady to get a screw driver and open the case and see if we can work things out. what is dell thinking?
that's all the tech support does in india &quot;open the case and we will run through the checklist.&quot; that's why i tell people to stay away from dell products.(of course they don't listen and soon regret it.)
when my acer's laptop cdrw failed, i had the option of replacing it myself. they overnighted the drive to me and i replaced it the next day. imagine how much time if i didn't have the option. cheers, bob
