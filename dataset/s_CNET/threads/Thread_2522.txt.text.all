<s> there used to be a large difference between routers but they have become very standard and there are few difference in the basic features.  </s>
<s> on the power and range issue they are pretty much the same. the maximum transmission power is limited by the government so this also limits the range.  </s>
<s> this means that most routers will get exactly the same coverage.  </s>
<s> all the other features is why there are so many routers.  </s>
<s> in general i would stay with a larger manufacture just so you can get help from others who have similar routers but that still leave a lot of choice.  </s>
<s> if you can afford it i would buy a dual band router since those are the most flexible.  </s>
<s> at least buy a n router since they only cost slightly more than g and support both n and g. last i would look for a router that has external antenna that can be removed and upgraded.  </s>
<s> many people find these routers ugly but putting larger antenna on is the only way to increase the coverage of a router.  </s>
<s> some countries it is not legal to put larger antenna on the router. the other difference between routers are feature you must decide if you need.  </s>
<s> some people need vpn and others need firewall features to limit their children surfing so its very hard to make a general recommendation.  </s>
<s> say me the best router model to buy not n and g i confuse say me the model plz give me a model which has great range than other routers it shuld have maximum range and speed i shuld be happy give that type of router model the range should be very far beacuse i saty at ground floor and i want to use in first floor and second floor so plz pick me a excellent router model plz pick a new one and amazing router say model plz  </s>
