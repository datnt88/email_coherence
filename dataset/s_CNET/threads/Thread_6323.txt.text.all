<s> well, i currently have a broken compaq presario from '04 that is broken, and hp is making very little progress in helping me, so if worse comes to worse, i was thinking of what computer i should get.  </s>
<s> i am on a budget of about $650.  </s>
<s> i would like a good built in gfx card, that would be able to play games like starcraft ii, team fortress 2, and mirror's edge well.  </s>
<s> i'd also like it to be able to run phot editing software well.  </s>
<s> (gimp, pse7, etc) i'll post more detail, but i think thats about it.  </s>
<s> oh. i'm canadian, so keep that in mind for companies and prices.  </s>
<s> there may be little support past a few years and certainly none for free today.  </s>
<s> today all support outside of warranty is a pay for it deal.  </s>
<s> i'm finding folk calling this not being nice but employees cost money, phone lines and more.  </s>
<s> back to your search.  </s>
<s> there are far too many desktops out there for that price.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> in the us, many a &quot;white box&quot; type system contains everything but the monitor are going for $399 on sale or not.  </s>
<s> depnds on brands but generally again some others are sold at $499 as well same type of deal.  </s>
<s> these even at basic level are better than any '04 system.  </s>
<s> while some are comanq and hp, emachines offers some too.  </s>
<s> dell, gateway, emachine, compaq, hp, acer, sony and toshiba all have some entry level system and/or deals online, check out the respective websites and compare.  </s>
<s> other online vendors offer deals too, notably newegg, tigerdirect, geeks and zipzoomfly, check for canadain sales.  </s>
<s> as for support, check what best fits you after the typical warranty.  </s>
<s> in warranty, certainly some maybe better than others, but generally speaking support is getting harder to please the consumer.  </s>
<s> don't expect too much any more, off-shore support and long wait times is typical.  </s>
<s> but heck, it keeps me in business as unhappy consumers call me from time to time with such complaints.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> @ r. proff.: i didn't mean the service was frustrating or annnoying, i meant that it took days or near a day for a person to get back to me via email.  </s>
<s> hp phone support was much &quot;worse&quot; though, as i got transfered 3 times, and given a dead number.  </s>
<s> but that is just a slight gripe, the people themselves that i talked to were very nice and understanding, too.  </s>
<s> @willy: thnaks.  </s>
<s> i've been looking at a few acer's with 4gb ram, one of them was an athlon x3 with a pretty decent gfx card.  </s>
<s> i am currently on an acer, and it seems to slow waaay down after a few years, even with cleaning it.  </s>
<s> newegg has a few good deals, a lot on some gateways, but a lot of the good (core 2 duo) computers are over $599.  </s>
<s> i'll have to lok at tigerdirect again, only looked at their laptops.  </s>
<s> thanks to you both.  </s>
<s> did you try newegg.ca and their &quot;picker&quot;?  </s>
<s> there was one hit at and while you might find better, let's see what you think.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> wow, that looks.. pretty amazing, thanks, i didn't know about that.  </s>
<s> plus i had been looking at x3's and i3's.  </s>
<s> i'll consider that.  </s>
<s> shipping price isn't great, but not bad either.  </s>
