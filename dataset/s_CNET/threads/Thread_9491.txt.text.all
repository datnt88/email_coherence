<s> is there any way to burn vcr tapes to my pc? my son (now deceased) was assistant athetic trainer for the alabama crimson tide from 1979-199.  </s>
<s> i have vcr tapes for every televised crimson tide game from 1985-1990.  </s>
<s> i want to heep them in a better format, and perhaps to edit and burn them to dvd-rw disks.  </s>
<s> thanks, ed henne  </s>
<s> my wife faced the same thing: many vcr tapes of instructional videos that she wanted to convert to digital format.  </s>
<s> we went to best buy and bought a dvd recorder that also had a vcr deck.  </s>
<s> dubbing tapes to dvd is a cinch, though you do have to do that in real time.  </s>
<s> once you have the dvds burned, you can use software (i use a dvd ripper from xilisoft) to rip those dvds into smaller mpegs if you want.  </s>
<s> but i suspect you just want dvds of the tapes, so the dual deck is the way to go.  </s>
<s> not expensive either.  </s>
<s> why not just get a dvd recorder?  </s>
<s> that's the method i use.  </s>
<s> a 55 buck dvd recorder.  </s>
<s> then off to the pc with the discs.  </s>
<s> for quick editing i use the following titles (the free ones.) virtual dub (snip snip!) dvd flick (that was easy) imgburn (that is good stuff) bob  </s>
