<s> here is the link i really am leaning towards the recertified:hp pavilion a6347c(ke620aar) athlon 64 x2 5600+ 4gb ddr2 640gb nvidia geforce 6150 se windows vista home premium it has the most memory and i am going to need it.  </s>
<s> i am a little wary about buying a refurbished and i've never used newegg.  </s>
<s> does anybody know about this product or if any of the other three would be better.  </s>
<s> i want the most bang for my bucks.  </s>
<s> refurbished/recertified products still come with a warranty, so it's a good deal.  </s>
<s> first off, i'll say i'm not a fan of buying computers remotely.  </s>
<s> i've done it a lot before (because of where i worked) and had doa computers from a couple different manufacturers.  </s>
<s> if what you get doesn't work, what are you gonna do?  </s>
<s> mess with it yourself to try to fix it?  </s>
<s> or give up the time & expense for a return or shipping for repair.  </s>
<s> a refurbished one has already been used and returned once.  </s>
<s> secondly, the poster's handle is softcoregamer. is a machine without a dedicated graphics card going to suit your needs?  </s>
<s> lastly, what's the motivation for 4 gb ram?  </s>
<s> cost?  </s>
<s> new egg is fine to deal with, use them a lot. the puter sounds pretty fair, depending upon price.  </s>
<s> it is set up for 64 bit software, that is why it is running 4gb of ram. the amd processor lends itself pretty well to gaming, wider fsb etc.  </s>
<s> the computer itself is not for me.  </s>
<s> i'm buying it for a relative.  </s>
<s> their new job requires that they have enough memory to download all of the their company software, customer files etc. i have a refursbished hp computer myself.  </s>
<s> about 8 months strong now.  </s>
<s> i'm just a little wary of getting them one because this is for a job and not just regular activity.  </s>
<s> p.s. my handle was made years ago when i didn't know better.  </s>
<s> this includes the one i would most likely get.  </s>
<s> here's a new a6432f that's comparable to a6357c.  </s>
<s> i'm sure that if wait a week or two, you'll be able to find one from a retailer like bb/cc/od that's the same price as newegg and probably has a monitor or printer thrown in.  </s>
<s> i agree, you could probably get a similar system from a retailer for a few more bucks and some have bundle deals that include a monitor which might be a better way to go unless you already have a good monitor.  </s>
