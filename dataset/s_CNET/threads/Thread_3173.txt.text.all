<s> we want to download netflix to our sony bdv-e770w/t77 blue-ray disc player.  </s>
<s> we have been trying for months to purchase netgear's powerline av 500 adapter xav5001 from the retailers linked to on their site.  </s>
<s> it is not available anywhere!  </s>
<s> do you know anything that might help us? is there a problem with it that is keeping it off the market? is there a comparable product available?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> i am to lazy to go look for the latest news on these devices so take my comments with that disclaimer.  </s>
<s> like most things there are ieee and other types of standards.  </s>
<s> i suspect like many companies that waited to launch 802.11n wireless until the standard was publish that may be the case here.  </s>
<s> they would take the chance of being incompatible if they launch based on unfinalized documents.  </s>
<s> last i heard 1901 or whatever the spec is was to be publish this fall for 500m power stuff.  </s>
<s> even after the spec is out and assuming they guess correctly and had manufacturing all set it will take a few months to get the product to retail.  </s>
<s> i would be betting on december for first shipments and volume shipment not to be until first quarter 2011.  </s>
<s> it's in stock and i could have a set tomorrow.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks for responding.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure what these &quot;standards&quot; mean, but i guess i'll have to continue to wait another few weeks to see what happens and if it does come to market.  </s>
<s> thanks, but this isn't the same product.  </s>
<s> is another type powerline unit.  </s>
<s> can you reveal what we are trying to solve here?  </s>
<s> if it's the av 500 you may have a long wait.  </s>
<s> there must be an alternative unit.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> standard are just the agreement all the various companies build equipment to.  </s>
<s> they can do it themselves and ignore the standards but few companies do.  </s>
<s> went and did some digging.  </s>
<s> they announce the draft copy sept 30/2010.  </s>
<s> most companies will manufacture based on this since it seldom changes before the office release.  </s>
<s> the final document is scheduled for feb 2011.  </s>
<s> there is almost no way to predict when you can buy these devices.  </s>
<s> all depends how much demand these companies see. the larger question will be can you really get 500m or is this just one of those fake marketing numbers.  </s>
<s> i would assume it will be faster than the current 200m products on the market but how much we will not know for a while.  </s>
<s> there's no other product out there that offers 500mb/s duplexed, or &quot;gigabit&quot; speeds, that's any kind of reliable.  </s>
<s> belkin has had a product out for a few ... weeks?  </s>
<s> months now?  </s>
<s> but the reviews are horrible.  </s>
<s> netgear got it right with their second and third gen products -- i'm a happy user of the 200mb/s adapters, but it's just not enough for heavy duty jobs like i do as a software engineer, and it's just barely up to the job of streaming hd movies or games -- don't bother trying to switch a lot of devices with heavy load over the xavb101 kit, you're going to choke it.  </s>
<s> nothing from netgear in the 500mb/s class.  </s>
<s> to go that fast we will have to wait or just get wired.  </s>
<s> for example i found that direct connection on 1000bt ethernet is my preferred connection for microsoft easy transfer jobs.  </s>
