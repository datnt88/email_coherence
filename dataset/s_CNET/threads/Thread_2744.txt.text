i just tried to test a hard drive in working pc ,but the dos startup boot just says ide hdd detected ,but not continue on , whats the problem. does that mean the hdd im testing is faulty ?
please look at the screen shot
your link loaded only into an error. it wasn't available then to view and i'm not going to become a member if that's the cause. next, your problem if your hd under test isn't formatted in order to get into a test mode, you should. it maybe working but isn't available to be accessed depending on the nature of the problem. if you haven't already. get the hd makers diags which are more readily capable of testing and/or accessing the hd w/o any os help. of course, follow their instructions for such use and beware of destructive and non-destructive testing. also, ware of the hd jumper setting found on the hd itself via decal/sticker. if not present then again visit the hd makers support website to access the required data. look into all that and come back with results. tada -----willy
there are a couple of factors that might affect your problem. so try to give more details, and yes your screen snap link is broken. did you check your bios that your hdd is detected as master? if yes, configure it as a slave and check its contents... maybe you need to reformat it completely and re-install your os.
