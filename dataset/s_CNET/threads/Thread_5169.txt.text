hi! when trying to play &quot;age of conan&quot; or &quot;freerealms&quot;, or the star trek online beta after a few minutes i get a crash, which according to win7 is being caused by atikmag.... just upgraded drivers and catalyst control center to 09.12 (also tried removing the catalyst control center because a post on the web said that might be the problem (it wasn't). tried switching off aero, tried 9.12 hotfix, tried re-seating memory (ran windows &quot;memory diagnostics utility&quot; showed no problems) nothing doing any good... help please! h/w diagnostics info: windows 7 rc version 6.1.7100 manufacturer: gigabyte technology co., ltd. board model: x48-dq6 version: x.x bios vendor: award software international, inc. bios version: f7, release date: 07/17/2008 chipset: intel x48 vendor id: 50001458 southbridge: 29168086 smb port used: 0500 cpu:intel(r) core(tm)2 duo cpu e8400 @ 3.00ghz cpuid:0-6-7-6 cores:2 internal freq=2999.0 mhz external freq=499.83 mhz multiplier=6.0 systembus freq=1999.3 mhz qdr thermo control configuration: full throttle:100.0% amd low power mode:disabled win 95/98 idle control:disabled device:none throttle:25.0% enable at:70.0c disable at:65.0c main sensor: it8718f monitored data values: mainboard=26.0c (0,diode,0.0c) cpu=35.0c (1,thermistor,0.0c) temp3=xx.xc (0,thermistor,0.0c) cpu0 core=49.0c (0,coretemp,0.0c) chassis=514 rpm cpu1=xxxx rpm cpu2=1097 rpm power=1214 rpm core=+0.94v aux=+1.89v +3.3v=+3.28v +5v=+5.05v +12v=+12.35v -12v=-xx.xxv -5v=-x.xxv hdd1 temp=28.0c wdc wd3200aaks-00b3a0 01.03a01 vga device: ati radeon hd 4800 series vga device id: 94421002,05021002.00 vga driver: ati technologies inc. radeon directx universal driver 8.14.10.0716 catalyst version: 09.12 vga sensor: catalyst vga gpu=37.0c vga env=xx.xc vga fan=xxxx rpm (xx%) vga core=+x.xxv vga bus=+x.xxv
notes this cpu to have a system bus speed of 1333 mhz and yours is 1993. is this overclocked? hint: don't. bob
here are a few troubleshooting items which you may have overlooked. sometimes a small problem can cause so much chain reaction. right now we've got a lot on our plate if we go at it one by one, but here's are some places to start: insufficient power bad memory modules over clocking motherboard/memory compatibility overheating defective motherboard
i don't really know how it got set that way, i couldn't even find how to change it directly in bios - ended up changing general settings to low-safe (can't remember what it called it). this changed it to 1333, haven't had a chance to see if it did any good. did notice that a hardware monitor program showed something in red zone heat right after re-booting (after one of these crashes), unfortunately i'm not sure exactly what it's telling me is the particular heat problem... it lists mainboard (ok), cpu (ok), temp 3 (which has no sensor), and cpu0 core (which is where the red showed up). why it shows cpu ok, and cpu0 core as a problem, i don't know what it's listing as this cpu0 core that i need to address....
ok that you changed it to stock which may help but have the machine's builder pull the heatsink off the cpu and drop some fresh heatsink paste there. then have them make sure the heatsink is in solid contact and fans to working. for heat issues it's very important to clear those up as it ages parts and machine quickly. a 5 year machine will see trouble after the first year. bob
i don't understand what i'm seeing here, i'm seeing 22c for the cpu, 41c for both core 0, and core 1.
that you can't trust the temperature sensors or software.
