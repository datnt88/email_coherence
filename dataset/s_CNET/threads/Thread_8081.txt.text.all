<s> i recently purchased an acer al1916wabd lcd monitor which is a widescreen 19&quot; monitor with digital dvi-d connector.  </s>
<s> before that, i owned an lg flatron l1720p 17&quot; lcd monitor. the aspect ratio of the lg is the standard 4:3 and the acer is 16:10. the acer is nice for playing videos and movies on which are starting to become mostly widescreen oriented, but much software is not especially games.  </s>
<s> my acer's 'biggest' widescreen resolution to where text is still somewhat easy to read is 1440x900.  </s>
<s> however, i still find this kind of small for webpages.  </s>
<s> i play a lot of the grand theft auto games which do support widescreen, but i notice game performance takes a hit when running the games in widescreen mode as opposed to 4:3. then there are the physical sizes of the monitors.  </s>
<s> the 19&quot; acer is about .75&quot;  </s>
<s> shorter than my 17&quot; lg, but the acer is about 3&quot; wider than the the lg. the lg is 10.75&quot; tall and 13&quot; wide and the acer is 10&quot; tall and 16&quot; wide.  </s>
<s> at this point, i think i am going to exchange the acer ws for another 17&quot; 4:3 monitor.  </s>
<s> might anyone have thoughts or opinions on the subject of widescreen and standard lcd monitors?  </s>
<s> ok i figured out something.  </s>
<s> since i have an nvidia video card and the latest drivers, i was able to create a custom resolution of 1280x800 so webpages and text is much easier to read. the directions are here... but you have to use the classic nvidia control panel to do it.  </s>
<s> here are some standard aspect ratios for 16:10 computer monitors... 2560x1600 1920x1200 1680x1050 1440x900 1280x800 1024x640 800x500  </s>
<s> i went from a 19&quot; 4:3 phillips monitor to a 20.1&quot; viewsonic widescreen and i love it.  </s>
<s> i am a pretty heavy gamer, and fortunately, many games support widescreen.  </s>
<s> some don't, but they don't look too bad being stretched out.  </s>
<s> most new games will support widescreen.  </s>
<s> i increasingly see promo screenshots and e3 booths usiing widescreen for games, which leads me to believe they are developing more for it.  </s>
<s> movies are in widescreen, many types of applications can be viewed better in widescreen, and i am slowly noticing some websites starting to take advantage of it.  </s>
<s> i would suggest that you keep the widescreen.  </s>
<s> use the native resolution, and adjust font sizes and magnification accordingly.  </s>
<s> as for your game performance issues, it is probably because of the change in resolution.  </s>
<s> yes i have decided to keep the widescreen now that i was able to make the custom resolution and therefore make my icons and text bigger.  </s>
<s> i think widescreen monitors are indeed the future, but it would be nice if video card manufacturers made drivers that supported standard resolution sizes i listed in a previous post in this thread.  </s>
<s> with my 256 mb nvidia geforce fx 5700le, the only one listed was 1440x900, but once i found out how to make custom resolutions, 1280x800 looked much better.  </s>
<s> i went from 17&quot; to 19&quot; proview (both 4:3) and begun to love the big screen of 1280*1024, temporary i use my son's 17&quot; flatron 795t which is a fantastic monitor, but i'm spoiled by the 19&quot;.  </s>
<s> so now i'm looking for a widescreen 19&quot; or 20&quot; (the acer seems nice), to fill my appetite.  </s>
<s> if you are text orientated please check if the monitor can handle that on the resolution you're normally working with, at the other hand if you're a gamer, take a look at tiniest details that's important.  </s>
<s> that's all...  </s>
<s> i also went from a 19' to a 20.1' viewsonic widescreen.  </s>
<s> its awesome!  </s>
<s> like the previous post said, most new games will support widescreen.  </s>
<s> and best of all, if your a huge world of warcraft gamer then you cant go wrong with a widescreen.  </s>
<s> looks amazing!  </s>
<s> dont forget that you must have a video card that will support the widescreen monitors.  </s>
<s> the better the video card, the better performance.  </s>
<s> i sure hope not, because i prefer a standard monitor!  </s>
<s> well tough luck because they are the future... hdtvs is definitely widescreen, and only a handfull are 4:3... those who prefer standard monitors probably like watching videos in weird formats... with a widescreen monitor, i am able to have 2 web browsers open (or one webbrowser and one quarter tv (pip) and one quarter webcam... with a 4:3 20 inch monitor, it really doesn't look so good with all the open windows...  </s>
