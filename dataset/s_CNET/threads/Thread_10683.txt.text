i have a sony vaio pcv rx550, 1.5 gig, 400 mh fsb, asus p4blx mobo, if i get a new motherboard with 800 fsb and a new prossersor, i won't be able to use my sony restore disc. can i copy the os only? how?
you have no license to do this. bob
thats what i thought, i heard you can buy a new licence or get a new code from microsoft to tranfer the data
go ahead and try, but be prepared for the negative result. bob
the forum policy doesn't allow such a question so it was removed. bob
