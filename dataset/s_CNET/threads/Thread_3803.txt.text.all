<s> hi..well i need a new computer that i can work with for about a year and half until i get a good laptop, because of this i dont want to go spend too much and get a high end pc, since i dont need a good gaming pc i use my ps3 for gaming.  </s>
<s> well basically i wanna know the difference between the core 2 duo processor and a pentium d (dual core ) processor.  </s>
<s> also these are the 2 computers i was looking at: or which one is better?  </s>
<s> thanks, any help is appreciated.  </s>
<s> the core 2 duo beats the pants off the old p4 d and i measured the watts on each box.  </s>
<s> p4 d was 205 watts.  </s>
<s> c2d (2.13ghz) was 95 to 100 watts. the c2d even at the higher clock rate than yours beats my old machine so badly that i'm going to write no contest.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yea i guess the c2d is a better deal, they both cost the same but the c2d one comes with vista, and has an extra 1gb of ram. is the nvidia geforce 7350 le a decent graphics card?  </s>
<s> and it says that there is another available pci slot , that means i can upgrade the graphic card right?.. i think its a pretty good deal for 500 bucks.  </s>
<s> tomshardware.com listed the 7300 as best video card under 100 bucks... bob  </s>
<s> thats a link for a mac mini for like 600 bucks.  </s>
<s> a mac mini is incredibly small and just as fast as a normal desktop.  </s>
<s> the cheap one has only 80 gb hard drive though.  </s>
<s> you could get an external hard drive for more room that you can use with the laptop you will get soon.  </s>
<s> macs have alot better of an os i prefer mac os to windows and i have only used macs in a store =p.  </s>
<s> i prefer them because ive had so many problems with windows and osx wouldnt have failed me yet most likely.  </s>
<s> you can also put windows on a mac if youd like.  </s>
<s> anyway i recommend the mac mini and you can buy a 19 inch widescreen for like $250 or so.  </s>
<s> i loved my 19 inch and still do as a secondary monitor.  </s>
<s> i think ull be happy with the mac mini.  </s>
<s> theres a 19 inch widescreen i found for $170  </s>
