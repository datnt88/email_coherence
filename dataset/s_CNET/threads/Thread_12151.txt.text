i run a wireless home network using a belkin g router. i've set the pc/xppro connected to the router to share a directory and a printer. the old pentium3 client was able to see the shares just fine. on my new macbook pro / xppro, however, i get an error when trying to access the workgroup. a generic error only: &quot;not accessible... might not have permissions... contact administrator...&quot;. the mac is able to connect to the internet via the wireless router. i found a link which says it may be norton anti-virus's fault (  ), but the error or the registry entry referred to there don't exist on my host. how can i find out why it's not accessible, and then to go about fixing it? thanx, nir
i wired the mac to the router with an ethernet cable to see if it would change things. no luck. should it have made a difference? can i use some different configuration to let them communicate via ethernet? btw, i get the above error when trying to access the workgroup. when i access that workgroup on the pc, it does see the mac as one of its members, but i get a similar error when trying to access it (the mac from the pc - &quot;the network path was not found&quot;). anyone know how i can solve this???
i can't offer a firm fix. i'm suspicious of firewalls and accounts as i first noted at this discussion link.  but it takes awhile for some to drill down and get that under control. bob
