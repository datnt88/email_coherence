hello, i finished building my system, installed windows, etc and everything was running fine. suddenly the power shuts off. when i tried to turn it back on, the power, fans etc would all turn on for a 1 sec and turn back off. then it finally stayed off. long story short, i ended up buying a new psu and mobo. same thing happens. i isolated the problem to the atx 12v 4 pin connector. when it's plugged in, the mobo won't turn on but when i unplug it, the mobo will turn on. does this mean my cpu is fried? any help would be appreciated. thanks. p.s. this problem occurs on both identical mobos. troubleshooting with just the 24 pin and 4 pin connected. specs: mobo: ecs gf7100pvt-m3 psu: thermaltake purepower 500 atx 12v 2.0 cpu: pentium d 3 ghz ram: 2gb
sitting on the bench ? vapcmd
psu is inside the case. mobo is outside the case.
have you tried starting with virtually nothing attached ...no drives, 1 stick of ram, only a speaker attached ? here's a link to the msi troubleshooting guide...  keep us posted. vapcmd
ok so i cleared cmos. connected only the 24 pin to mobo with speaker and power on cables attached. 12v not attached. still same thing. cpu and psu fans turn on but no sound or anything. verified all no post steps on msi's web site. still no luck. @!#$%^ gonna try a new cpu tomorrow.
