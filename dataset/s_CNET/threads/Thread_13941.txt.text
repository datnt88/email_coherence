i sent in rebate form and invoice for $500, they first denied receiving it, then they denied the invoice was included, and it was voided. their rebate vendor, and alienware, are scammers. i filed with the ftc and attorney general florida. dont buy from alienware, they will rip you off !!!!!
do you like your computer?
thanks for the info aws! -jdm
alienware makes an awesome gamers delight! how could someone not like to have one? haha
and i don't do server/professional, nor do i know where to obtain a decent mips isa os, nor do i care to find out i wouldn't like an alienware, or any botique computer for that matter also to alienwaresucks...um, is it possible that it got lost in the mail?
purchased 11/04, received 12/04. mailed rebate form & original receipt via certified mail in dec. according to the rebate form &quot;please wait 12-24 weeks while we process your rebate&quot;. waited...no check. called and was told the rebate form was rec'd 1/3/05, but no &quot;receipt&quot; was enclosed. i've read of several others with this same story. we are considering a class action lawsuit (any lawyers interested?). the system may be good, but when a company advertises a price *post* rebate, it really puts a bad taste in my mouth to have to turn on the pc every day and look at it every day knowing that alienware has my $500 and the $500 of many others...
