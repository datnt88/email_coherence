<s> hello there.  </s>
<s> let me first say that i'm not really a gamer, or know too much about what i have....but i do know that it isn't too shabby.  </s>
<s> my friend was selling his older alienware (i think it's a 2000 and i think the color is martian red) for only $200, and i may not know much, but i do know that is a hell of a deal....since it ran doom3 and half life flawlessly with all the settings maxed. the 2nd best card on the market at the time was installed, a radeon 700 something, and there is an audigy sound card on the front, and i think my friend upgraded the hard drive to 200 gigs...not sure if that is stock though.  </s>
<s> he may have done more to it, but i'm not sure.  </s>
<s> first, i've had for over a year and it has just been sitting under my desk not working.  </s>
<s> what i think happened was one of the fans stopped working, since it got really hot right before it stopped....which i was told is ok...but i don't see how it is now i think about it.  </s>
<s> it basically starts to boot, then gets to a blue screen...which i imagine is the desktop color but i don't remember now...and then restarts again in a continous loop.  </s>
<s> i've been told by a couple people that it is the power core, or center, or something and that it's a cheap fix....like $30. you would think with a piece of technology so advanced, that if a fan quit...it wouldn't ruin the whole thing, and something inexpensive would break to save your comp....if not, what could this be and how do i fix it?  </s>
<s> secondly, how do i check what year it is and what the specs are?  </s>
<s> (what are the specs on an '00 anyway?) finally, what can i get for it when i sell it?  </s>
<s> i thank you all for being kind and helping me.  </s>
<s> if you all have any guitar related questions....i'm all ears jeff daughtridge  </s>
<s> from the year 2000?  </s>
<s> don't walk away from the deal, run!!! you can get new complete systems for about $250-$300 these days.  </s>
<s> a nonfunctioning fan can mean many things, incluting a bad motherboard, psu, or it could be just a broken fan.  </s>
<s> if the cpu or psu fan doesn't work, that is a major problem.  </s>
<s> can't tell without testing.  </s>
<s> no one can tell you anthing about what you could get for it if yo don't give detailed specs. the following free utilities will help you get hardware specs.  </s>
<s> also tell us the os. belarc advisor everest home edition pc wizard cpu-z sandra lite aside: any windows computer without the windows xp installation cd and valid product key is completely useless in the long run...unless you make it a linux machine.  </s>
<s> ...i have owned the comp for over a year.  </s>
<s> the radeon card was worth i think he said like $400-$500 new, and the audigy card is im gonna guess worth at least $100. the comp worked for about 2 weeks while i owned it; worked great too. the fan was on the sliding door that went out.  </s>
<s> also, i think that it is a 2000, b/c it isnt shaped like the ones of today....i wish i knew more on the subject really.  </s>
<s> who cares what the case looks like.  </s>
<s> what's in it?  </s>
<s> we need to know model names.  </s>
<s> cpu (cpu-z) motherboard (system board) model number (cpu-z) memory (ram) amount and type (cpu-z) hard drive(s) cd/dvd drive video card model which audigy soundcard (there are many) look on the back of the computer for power supply unit maximum wattage and manufacturer (model number if there).  </s>
<s> does this include keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor?  </s>
<s> what monitor?  </s>
<s> what speakers?  </s>
<s> hello, we are going to need some basic information. the first place to start is what motherboard do you have?  </s>
<s> take the side off the case & look for a make & model on the motherboard.  </s>
<s> it will be something like asus a7n8x.  </s>
<s> next, with the side off, start the computer & look at all the fans.  </s>
<s> are they all spinning?  </s>
<s> are they clear?  </s>
<s> not all clogged up with dust? the main fans to look at are the cpu fan & the power supply fan.  </s>
<s> note everything & give us as many details as possible.  </s>
