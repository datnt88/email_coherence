2976	3	298758	2796956	2796936	kees bakker	6/22/08 7:07 am	1.21411842e12	re: follow up	if you go to our storage forum  you'll see quite a number of posts about failing external hard disks. and hardly any on failing internal ones. that's my reason to recommend an internal one for daily use and use externals for transport and a backup copy only. convince yourself! the standard windows xp installation cd has the option to start over with a clean windows (and probably program files) folder and keep your my documents. but quite a few pc's come with a restore cd that brings the machine back to factory conditions. my recommendation would be to buy an external hard disk (use if for a backup copy in the future) and copy all your pictures and such to it. it's nice to have a backup copy, even if you don't need it at the moment. of course, with most models you can take out the disk (be sure it's ide, i don't think your pc has sata already) and 'promote' it to an internal drive. then this would only cost you the case, and that's some $25. i suppose your pictures are worth that much! on the long run i'd recommend both an internal disk (if the current 80gb isn't enough) and an external one for a backup copy. but that might be a nice santaclaus or birthday present, if you've got a copy of all your current data on both the old and the new internal disk. kees

2976	7	298758	2797048	2796979	sbscanlon	6/22/08 10:04 am	1.21412904e12	buying ahead	dear squirtlewa: thanks for all the ideas. here are some follow-up questions/comments that now come to mind... 1) lcd monitor - yes, i was curous about the power issue too - the monitor is from 1997 i think. 2) sorry for the ram - it is indeed 1gb, not mb; 3) if i can figure out how to restore eveything i need after reinstalling xp, then i think i can manage the time to do it myself. however, would you suggest any service that is good for projects like this? geek squad or the like? i have never used anyone like that. 4) i get your point about the internal hd issue - i think... so i could buy internal hd of much larger size, but it owuld have to be pata and therefore would also be out of date and essentially stalling the inevitable. 5) re the laptop - i think where i am heading is to a) get a good external hd that will last beyond this system and clear a lot of space on the hd; b) try the os reinstall and reformat as suggested to improve performance; c) get a lcd; d) get a cost effective laptop to hook into our wireless network here.
