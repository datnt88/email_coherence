i have a 2005 dell dimension 5150c with windows xp . it has a cdrw/dvd drive (philips scb5265). i want to get a dvd writer & am not sure if i should get an external or internal writer. which is best? which is easiest? and which do you recommend? please, please help me.
that is a small forum factor pc. while it came with a dvd as an option, it seems unless you buy the unit expressly made for the sff case, it would be much easier to use an external drive. if you do buy the internal, here is how you install it.  high speed usb (2.0) would give you close to internal speeds, so assuming you do not want to go the internal route, i see no real reason to be concerned.
i kind'a like the external more as i can use it on different machines. portable is nice. i also prefer building my own. get a good external case and pick your own drive.
if your power supply can handle the extra load then go internal if not external is just fine
existing dvd. here's an ide dvd-dl by pioneer that's getting good buyer reviews at newegg. many others to choose from.   vapcmd
