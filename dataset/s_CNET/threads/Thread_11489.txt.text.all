<s> i'd think this would be a nice upgrade for me.  </s>

<s> i am having such a difficult time deciding, lol.  </s>
<s> i just want to be able to play some good games.  </s>
<s> and you can play most games on medium settings with the 9500gt.  </s>
<s> no need to immediately start replacing components but the 80gb hard drive is pretty dinky.  </s>
<s> the new comp will blow that one out of the water.  </s>
<s> it has a much faster cpu, more ram and way better video card  </s>
<s> indeed.  </s>
<s> i don't even know what to ask anymore.  </s>
<s> either i buy this, use it for a bit and upgrade graphics card when i can, or wait until i can afford to build one myself.  </s>
<s> decisions!!!  </s>
