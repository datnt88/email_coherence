i have a 6800gs nvidia graphics card and i wanted to know what the best configuration to use with my vizio 32&quot; hd lcd tv. i am getting some spots on my tv. i am using the vga cable because the tv does not have a dvi connection. i could use a dvi to a hdmi cable. but i still don't know what setting i should use?
when you say you are getting spots, are you sure they aren't dead spots? paul
i am sure because they never show up in the same area. sometimes my screen will freeze and i will have to restart my computer. then it works fine. it seems to happen only when i turn my comp off and then turn it back on. when i have it running for a little while it runs fine but i have to turn it on and off twice and let it run for a couple of minutes before i restart. other wise it runs real slow and jumpy. i have a good feeling it has to do with the monitor and video card because i put my old monitor on and it worked fine. i have run virus programs and everything is a ok.
