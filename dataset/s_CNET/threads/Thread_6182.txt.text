im purchasing a hp a6230n computer 2.8 dual core, 3 gig ram, 400 hd going to upgrade the graphics card and the one im thinking about is the 8600 gt oc. specs looked good, but i want to know how this card will hold up to todays games, toms hardware's tier talked about the 8600 gt but not the oc version so i was wondering if anyone here knew about it. thanks.
from memory it wrote that within the same family you might see about 5 percent change in the scores. it's a fine card but i'd still pick from the &quot;best video card for the money&quot; any day of the week. read  in closing, no gamer i know of is happy with today's cards. bob
so is it worth an extra $80 for the x1950 pro (which is direct x 9.0) over the 8600 gt oc (direct x 10)
and benchmarks. this is the only way i'll choose one card over another. bob
