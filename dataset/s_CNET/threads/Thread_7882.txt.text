hello all, newbie here. i am trying to use my pc's internet connection that i am getting from a cricket wireless device to go to a linksys wrt54g router. i believe it should be possible to enable ics and hook up a cable from the nic on the pc to the wan port on the router but have not been able to get it to work so far. os=win 7 but would like to know how to do it on xxp also. any help would be appreciated. thanks
is a comparable discussion. but, apart from learning that it's difficult, nothing came out of it. kees
in xp it did work here but i can't offer any support. there are only a few million pcs out there and i've never found 2 that were the same. bob
you could just bridge the wireless and wired nic in the pc? i've done this in reverse to turn a wireless nic into an ap. perhaps it would work in either direction.
thanks a lot !!!! very easy solution. just a few changes to the configuration. 1. disable ics 2. plug the network cable into the lan instead int oth wan port on the router 3. bridge the two connections thanks steven
just bridge the two connections
just disable ics and bridge the two connections
