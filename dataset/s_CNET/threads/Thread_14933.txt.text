hey there! i want to get a new video card for my birthday but i'm not sure if i should sli with the card i currently have or if i should just get a better card. my current card: amd radeon 6870 1gb (i would be sli'ing this one) what i want: amd radeon 6950 (would just be a single card)
i have no idea of how to compare vid perf of a 2x 6870 vs 1x 6950. i hope you have a whopper psu. the 6870 is 150w each. the 6950 is 200w. got the cooling to handle this sort of heat?
&quot;to the list!&quot; - gamerman! this month i see it at  move up the list to where your budget is for gpu and power supply is! bob
