hey there everyone! my wife and i recently moved from the u.s. to france and are now looking to get a multifunction printer/scanner to assist us with out work. since we are only here for two-years, we were hoping to get one that has a universal power supply, so that we can bring it back to the states with us. sadly, i may be using the wrong search criteria on the internet, since i cannot find any info on these. or, maybe they just don't exist. any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
i looked at our hp c4780 all in one and the ac adapter shows 100 to 240vac and 50/60 hz. from what i know that is universal (actually terrestrial earth) so you may only need to look at the ac adapters and not the printers. bob
you can purchase universal conversion kits, most box stores have them, you shouldn't have to worry about swapping out the power inverter.
