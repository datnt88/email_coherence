i'm sure it's been asked before, but i am still curious. which do you think is better the big name brands, or something generic (concerning cabling)? i've been looking in the retail stores, and their cabling is expensive, especially monster and belkin stuff. i come online and can find dirt cheap cables. is there any difference in the cables?
trust me, i'm not stalking you or anything. hope my other comment was useful. as far as my knowledge goes, there is no difference between name brands and the generic stuff. i know that hdmi cables are all held to a certain standard and therefore they are all of technical equal quality. i think you pay more for the name brands simply because they are recognizable. they also look pretty nice. that being said, i never buy monster cables. they are so overpriced. i have to give a shout out to  again. those guys treat me right. their cables look great, they have a lifetime warranty (just like monster), and they are cheap! what's better than that?
quality matters and thus any decent namebrand will stand behind thier product. while generic brands do deliver but there is less desirable products offered and there's no way to tell the difference until failure. you can buy with confidence any namebrand product overall. my experience with generic brands is pretty much ok, but those that failed i had no one to turn to for warranty replacement and/or recourse since they failed long after some period that any store would stand behind them plus no &quot;sales receipt&quot; by that time, figures. tada -----willy
many low- to mid-priced cat-5 and usb cables over the years, and have had no problems not attributable to abuse (like someone pulling on it or kinking it). i never buy the expensive ones if i can help it. frank
