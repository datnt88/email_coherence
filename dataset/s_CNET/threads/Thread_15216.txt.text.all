<s> i just upgraded to verizon's mifi 2200 because i was tired of having to wrestle my partner for the single use usb modem i used to have. the problem was that neither of our desktop computers had wireless capability so i went out and purchased two belkin wireless g 7050 adapters.  </s>
<s> after installing the drivers i found that both computers would connect, then disconnect and would or would not reconnect when hitting the repair option for the network icon.  </s>
<s> i decided to try using my laptop, which has a built in wireless device, to see if it was the belkin adapter.  </s>
<s> i learned that if only one of the belkin adaptors is in use, everything works find.  </s>
<s> so, the laptop and one desktop can be on line, but not the two desktops at the same time.  </s>
<s> i wrote belkin about this but have yet to hear back.  </s>
<s> does anyone have an idea as to why the mifi will not connect through two belkin adapters at the same time?  </s>
<s> any suggestions would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> could be the usual settings like wep (busted!) or other things but i couldn't find such detail in your post.  </s>
<s> try and how we ask for wifi to be setup.  </s>
<s> if it still drops maybe it's defective, not charged, etc. bob  </s>
<s> i gave up on getting the belkin wireless adapters to work and bought two zonet wireles pci adapters.  </s>
<s> they worked perfectly from the installation.  </s>
<s> btw, i returned the belkin wireless duds to best buy, 25 days after pruchase, and they gave me my money back!  </s>
<s> way to go geek squad!  </s>
