<s> i work in a school with the internet connection distributed to every room through ethernet ports on which every computer must plug itself to.  </s>
<s> what is the cheapest/best wireless adaptor i can get that will just require being plugged into the ethernet port?  </s>
<s> i want to use my laptop anywhere within the range of my classroom.  </s>
<s> you need to get permission from the network administrator to ''plug in'' a wireless access point (wap).  </s>
<s> once you have a wap (with the security settings your network administrator recommends), any computer that is to make a wireless connection to the wap will need a wireless network adapter.  </s>
<s> the wireless network adapter needs to be compatible with the wap's broadcast standard (wireless-g, wireless-b, wireless-a).  </s>
<s> cheapest waps are often wireless routers that can be configured to function as a wap.  </s>
<s> it can be difficult to find a wap that is simply plug-n-play because the existing network setup might not match the default wap settings.  </s>
<s> i have used small wireless routers as waps for classrom and hotel use.  </s>
<s> they are usually called travel routers or compact routers.  </s>
<s> you plug it in, configure it once, and pop it into your notebook travel bag when you are finished.  </s>
<s> i have had success with the following compact/travel models: linksys wrt54gc linksys wtr54g netgear wgr101 i usually travel with linksys wrt54gc because it has a lot of functions and extra ports if needed.  </s>
<s> you could cause a lot of problems on your school networks that would upset any network admin.  </s>
<s> believe me, it's easy to track too.  </s>
<s> but, if you got permission to do this, the setup is simple.  </s>
<s> purchase access point and hook it into the port in the wall.  </s>
<s> broadcast your signal and voila!  </s>
<s> most of the time, this will not work because the access point needs to be registered on the network that is running on.  </s>
<s> chances are you will be able to connect to the network, but internet might not be allowed.  </s>
<s> (depends on the schools network.)  </s>
