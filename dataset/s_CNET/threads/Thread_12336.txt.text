just got this as a gift from my employers. 64mb flash drive! (yay). now, what can i do with this? currently i'm thinking a few options: 1) make it a bootable drive for emergency rescue operations. but, which os / distro? is there an os that can fit within 64mb? 2) install windows portable apps on it. thinking of abiword for sure, what other useful apps you think can fit on it?
but i found my older laptop could only boot from 4gb and smaller memory sticks. what i did boot was ubuntu and it did run abiword  . ubuntu is less than 1gb which leaves you a lot of open space. bob
how long have you worked for him/her, hehe. or should that be 64gb...now that would be nice. do as you would any harddrive.
thanks for your reply, but it's 64 megabytes only. that's like 10% of a single cd storage. i searched around, and looks like damn small linux may be the way to go.
worked for this large-scale healthcare employer for almost two years now. actually they had to gift something on doctor's day, and apparently they came out with this brilliant idea of 64mb flash drive (don't know where they purchased them from). now 64mb is a great size for carrying documents and even pictures (like patient x-ray jpegs etc), but i'm going to use my 8gb flash drive for that purpose. it's the smallest flash drive i've ever had, and i really want to experiment with it, in that how much &quot;usefulness&quot; can fit into it.
mybad. i haven't seen that size in years. and my oldest stick is 128mb! ok. damn small linux it is.  has the others. bob
11 years ago, it costed $29.99. never let me down. now it's a bootable pen for any laptop without cd/dvd drive. love it
