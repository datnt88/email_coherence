where do you plan to do most of your researching and/or shopping for your next pc purchase? important note : online means using the internet and offline means not using the internet - ill do all my researching and shopping offline - ill do most of my researching and shopping offline - ill do equal amounts of my researching and shopping offline and online - ill do most of my researching and shopping online - ill do all of my researching and shopping online
i do not shop online. i use spare parts to rebuild computers. researching is on;ly to see processor speeds, availability of old ram, compatible oses for the rebuilt box.
i research online and usually shop off line i have a old dell dimension 2400 that is on its last leg.i do not play games i search the internet quite a lot. i like to read various newspapers,how to do sites etc. i am looking for a little extra power to give me good response time and little digital photo editing. sta70
the research is the important part a good price may not be a good deal. the more i know the better i can shop. in the future i may buy more on line but now i stick to off line shopping. with compusa closing this might change. they were the best stocked store in the area now that there gone. i'm scrambling for a new store or two to take there place. this will not be easy to do.
