hi....i want to upgrade my computer, its motherboard and processor will be upgraded. please tell me which one should i install amd 64 or pentium 4. i want a 3.0ghz processor. and which motherboard should be nice with it. please give me the model no. of both processor and motherboard. (if possible). please give me a lesser price motherboard and processor. thank you
it changes daily and then you might find a sale. however the cpu charts at  should help you sort out which is better. bob
there are lots of dual core cpus with lower clock speeds that do far better on benchmarks you do realize right? if you want to recycle the ram from your existing computer you should specify what that is, imo. lastly, you could go with some cheap socket 939 amd64 configuration but this will have limits on upgrading you know. regards, jb
