<s> i currently have a linksys b router.  </s>
<s> i have a linksys wireless g laptop card.  </s>
<s> my speed, range and connectivity are very low (12%).  </s>
<s> i was wondering if upgrading my router would help with this issue?  </s>
<s> which should i upgrade to - wireless g or the newer wireless n? should i stay with linksys since that is what the laptop card is?  </s>
<s> i noticed that linksys has wrt54gt, wrt54g and wrt54gs. is one better than the other?  </s>
<s> thanks so much.  </s>
<s> it is really hard to get this info.  </s>
<s> an upgrade to a g router is the least costly option.  </s>
<s> matching your present network card will give you the most bang for the buck.  </s>
<s> an n router will also require an n adapter to see any speed increase.  </s>
<s> i replaced my chip set ethernet adapter with a wired ethernet card and the speed increase was very good, exceeding a second giga bit of ram that was installed.  </s>
<s> you might consider this rather then the router replacement. the card was a 10/100/1000 with a gb of memory.  </s>
