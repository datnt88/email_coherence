i want to view and record my current tv lineup to my pc. i have a cable box from my cable company (astound). will it go through the cable box for one channel viewing-recording or is there a way to bypass the cable box for simultaneously viewing and recording on the pc like a dvr does? i have expanded basic cable programing. also, what would be better: a usb tuner or internal tv tuner card and whats a good one for under $100.00. thanks
most of the cable tv (but not all) available on channels 2-125 will still be viewable on the tv tuner cards. hd may or may not be available. you would need to check with your provider if they offer clear-qam channels. if you do not know what that means, see here for a discussion:  or google for various clarification. once you find out what is available, then start shopping. many like the hauppauge devices, see here:  but you are free to explore other brands.
would the &quot;hauppauge&quot; hd pvr do what i what?
but it costs more than $100 you mentioned see here:  if you are not as concerned with hd recording, then the wintv-pvr line is quite popular. there are four choices of that line or there are wintv-hvr which add clear qam channels along with the sd channels. the hd pvr ( hauppauge 1212 ) is the most all round capable choice as long as the inputs fit your needs. it looks like you have to use component inputs for hd recording. it has pass thru so you can intercept the signal from the stb, then on to your tv without any other changes in the connections.
go for the ati wonder tv card. it has the highest ratings of any tuner cards out there.
