when i bought my pc in may it played my dvd movies. then about 4 months later it stopped working. today i went round and round looking through the trouble shooting, windows media, power dvd and lite-on (dvd rw drive maker) and it seems the dvd decoder went 'poof'. i was at cyberlync (power dvd) and windows media trying to update or find a decoder. graphics card; visiontek ati radeon 1300 (installed today) os; windows xp sp2 media; windows media 10, power dvd 5 dvd; lite-on dvdrw sohw-1633s windows media player only has the option for cd audio under &quot;play dvd/cd&quot;. anyone have any idea where the decoder went?
power dvd or &quot;other.&quot; check you cd software collection. bob
hi, i use power dvd, it works well. but probably you have some programs data lost or corrupt? btw, check the dvd drive, it can be broken.
the only cd that came with my emachines t6212 is the windows xp. i had &quot;interactual player&quot; on here and that would not play either so i figured the drive was bad. i forgot i bought a geek squad contract so i called them. they had me uninstall the dvdrw drive in the device manager and restart my computer. winxp detected it and reinstalled the drivers and now it works. thank you for your input.
