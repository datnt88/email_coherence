<s> yup thats right im done with it but im not really sure if i should be.  </s>
<s> see i have a pretty nice nvidia sli rdy mobo and a evga 7800 gtx it justs i have never really been impressed with my graphics.  </s>
<s> like most of the time when i play games i get this kind of graphic ripple on the screen or maybe alittle studdering and thats not even really playing games like fear witch has a kind of slow motion drag of the graphics with it and now im thinking i should have went with a ati gpu.  </s>
<s> but if i did lets says buy a x1900xt cf and new psu then a new ati crossfire mobo in the future should i exspect better performance then what i have now or would it all be the same?  </s>
<s> thanks for the help, nick  </s>
<s> dont blame the graphics card as it could be from other factors that you are experiencing these problems.  </s>
<s> have u thought about overheating?  </s>
<s> or say a faulty graphics card which u couldve rma'd.  </s>
<s> how about listing the specs on your computer?  </s>
<s> and graphic ripple?  </s>
<s> what do u mean by this? and u said that u would buy a new psu if u get an ati card?  </s>
<s> so i am assuming u know u already have a lack of power?  </s>
<s> now i may be wrong...  </s>
<s> lol sorry i forgot x2 4800 2 gbs of xms ram evga 7800 gtx 256 gpu 500watt psu nvidia nforce4 sli rdy mobo and 5 total fans and about the psu no i think mine is fine im just going to get a new one for future needs.  </s>
<s> about the ripple it kind of looks like a line where the graphics are all messed up like srambled idk.  </s>
<s> altogether i know something has to be wrong cause a 500+ gpu card cant be this crappy.  </s>
<s> thanks again, nick  </s>
<s> what settings have u got on the games?  </s>
<s> maybe there set to high?  </s>
<s> have u tried turning down the settings?  </s>
<s> maybe try returning the card and getting another one?  </s>
<s> latest drivers?  </s>
<s> ya, seems like it is the video card.  </s>
