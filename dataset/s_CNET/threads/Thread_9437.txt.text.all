<s> hello, ironically, the hd on my dell inspiron failed this week, a day after i started a massive backup effort.  </s>
<s> my fault for not doing so more often (a recovery service is currently trying to retrieve portions of my phd dissertation....).  </s>
<s> i want to avoid this headache should (actually, when) i have another failure.  </s>
<s> i do have an external drive that is several years old, but it was quite a pain to use and was limited by the size of the files i could transfer.  </s>
<s> this leads me to several questions: - are most external drives formatted the same, or is there a specific feature i should look for in purchasing a new drive?  </s>
<s> i remember someone telling me that my file transfer issue was related to the format of the drive.  </s>
<s> - what is the most user-friendly method or software to perform regular backups?  </s>
<s> for example, i have a new hd coming from dell.  </s>
<s> *if* i had been backing up my data, is there a way that i could simply install my new hd, plug in the external backup, and it could create an identical replicate of my old hd(files, applications, settings..the works)?  </s>
<s> -related to my last question, i'm looking for a drive that i could simply plug in once a day and execute a backup with little effort on my part. is this possible?  </s>
<s> can it be scheduled to create a &quot;new&quot; back-up file daily and replace the previous one?  </s>
<s> - can the external drive be organized to both create a daily backup and to have long-term storage for files i don't want taking up space on my laptop?  </s>
<s> or do i need two drives, one devoted to backup and one for long-term storage?  </s>
<s> - i read a suggestion in another thread that you should purchase a drive 3-4x the size of the files you want to backup. is this accurate?  </s>
<s> thank you in advance for your help.  </s>
<s> (fyi - i tried to search for this information in previous threads but was not finding exactly what i needed.  </s>
<s> i apologize if this has been discussed recently and i missed it.)  </s>
<s> forgot to add - my system runs vista, if that makes any difference (several older posts referred to software for xp).  </s>
<s> in the interest of not repeating the many many posts on the subjects addressed, please take a look at some of the searches below...starting with the one on 'backup'.  </s>
<s> i would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas. the one thing i recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location...whether it be electronic bits and bytes .  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> especially an external hdd, or even hard copy.  </s>
<s> once you've explored the many approaches and eliminated those you don't want, you'll probably have a few more questions.  </s>
<s> hoping this helps.  </s>
