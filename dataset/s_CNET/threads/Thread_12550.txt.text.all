<s> so i got an antec nine hundred case for xmas and i am trying to put my rosewill card reader into one of it's bays.  </s>
<s> i have the bay grill cut-out part and the 3.5&quot; mount adapter but i cant see how to attach it to the case itself.  </s>
<s> could anyone provide any help to my problem please?  </s>
<s> case: card reader:  </s>
<s> i've either used the floppy drive bay, some 3.5 inch adapter or in a pinch put it into some 5 inch bay by drilling a few mounting holes then crafting a plate to fill in the void.  </s>
<s> i doubt there is any web page or manual for this.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i do have the 3.5 inch adapter that came with the case.  </s>
<s> and the grill cut-out, to fit it in there.  </s>
<s> but there are no holes i can use to mount it in.  </s>
<s> do you suggest i just drill in my own?  </s>
<s> but why would we not drill when we see such an issue?  </s>
<s> my only advice is to do such when the case is empty so you can be sure any metal chips don't get into your other gear.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the &quot;1 x 5.25&quot; to 3.5&quot; adapter&quot; and the 3.5&quot; face plate.  </s>
<s> or buy this... or buy this vapcmd  </s>
<s> vapcmd, i just posted photobucket links to the adapters i already have that came with it.  </s>
<s> i just don't think the adapter will work properly with the card reader i have. the adapter doesnt canter the card reader in the bay so it lines up with the grill cut-out part.  </s>
<s> tray/face plate that came with the case don't line up ( and they should line up and mount properly ).....then try one of the other adapters.  </s>
<s> like you, i have a smartcard reader that would fit in a 3.5 floppy drive but i chose to put it into a 3.5&quot; to 5.25&quot; adapter tray (second link above) and it fits and installs exactly as intended.  </s>
<s> let us know how it works out.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> threat the 3.5in.  </s>
<s> card reader like a floppy drive, they're practically the same size.  </s>
<s> any adapter for possible 3.5-to-5.25  </s>
<s> bay opening is also possible.  </s>
<s> your case, may need to be disassembled for ease of access for both items for final assembly.  </s>
<s> also, i have found removing the card reader frt.  </s>
<s> panel may help(most clip-in).  </s>
<s> return when done. i don't what is causing your problem unless you have an unique situation.  </s>
<s> if the grill cut-out you mention is suppose to mount, it probably requires a flat surface or direct to be flush as in left alone. the case may &quot;surround&quot; it but it should seat in the case itself, flush to the outside of bay.  </s>
<s> -or- that face plate is 5.25 mounting to surround the card reader as in extra venting.  </s>
<s> but, if not in 5.25 bay, it becomes extra part.  </s>
<s> unless, you provide direct install pictures and not part links, maybe it could explain better.  </s>
<s> from what you've provided it isn't clear yet, other than what i explained maybe the problem.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
