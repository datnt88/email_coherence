<s> i have a p4 2.4 ghz (800 mhz fsb, ht) with 1 gb of ram, and 8xagp.  </s>
<s> i currently have an nvidia geforce fx 5200 video card with 128 mb of ram. the card is decent, but i notice it slowed down on some of the newer games i have.  </s>
<s> i want to upgrade, but have a limited budget (less than $200) to spend.  </s>
<s> i've been looking at ati's radeon 9800 pro with 128 mb of ram. is this a significant upgrade over what i have?  </s>
<s> i just want to make sure i'm making a decent upgrade...meaning an upgrade that will speed up the newer games out there.  </s>
<s> any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks, bb  </s>
<s> if u want cheaper, then go for 6600gt but the 6800 is better and well worth the xtra money.  </s>
<s> thanks for the recommendation.  </s>
<s> however, i'd still like to know if it is a significant upgrade to go from my nvidia geforce fx 5200 to an ati radeon 9800 pro.  </s>
<s> are there any quantitative resources on the internet that compare how good video cards are stacked up against each other?  </s>
<s> again, any help is appreciated.  </s>

<s> with going from nvidia to ati is the drivers switching and stuff...ur better off just sticking with nvdia and getting the 6600gt  </s>
<s> your current video isn't slowing down its your gaming applications demanding more.  </s>
<s> getting a 9800pro is a step up &quot;chipset&quot; wise but its a dated chipset.  </s>
<s> you're logical step-up with nvidea is the 6600gt and keeping with what the look and feel of nvidea setting.  </s>
<s> let's face it, if you want to get the best video, you got to spend the $$$ and then wait awhile, it'be old news.  </s>
<s> considering your $200 budget, having the 6600gt is a good bargain compared to yet upper level chipsets.  </s>
<s> beware though, sooner or later it'll be the bargain offering probably in a yr. as pricing drops and then another chipset will take its place within that pricing range.  </s>
<s> fyi - getting a more powerful video card, you need to prepare to have a decent power supply of at least 350w or better.  </s>
<s> these new video cards are sucking the juice and if not taken care of will cause problems, system wide, if not shutdown or presistant reboots and/or bsds.  </s>
