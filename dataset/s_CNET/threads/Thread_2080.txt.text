my roommate bought a new wireless router, installed it on his desktop and it worked fine. then, when he shutdown his computer the signal cut out for the router and when the computer is turned back on the connection stays off. so far the only way to get it working again is to re-install every time. the router is still on, it's just everyone loses connection when the desktop turns off, and we can't figure out why. he's using windows vista sp2 and the router is a d-link xtreme n gigabit router.
could you let us know how exactly the wireless router fits into your network? is it connected this way? internet -&gt; modem -&gt; wireless router -&gt; desktop or is it configured differently? is there another router in the mix somewhere? there shouldn't be any need to reinstall anything on the pc to get the wireless working for others. i'm assuming that a simple reboot of the router doesn't work?
it's connected as you said internet -&gt; modem -&gt; wireless router -&gt; desktop and rebooting it didn't work either.
are you losing the actual wireless signal? no signal strength on the laptops and does the wlan light on the router go off? if that's the case, then i'm thinking the router is faulty or possibly the nic in your desktop is bad. test by connecting a laptop by wire to the router and turn it off as you did with the desktop. if the problem reoccurs, then it's likely the router is bad. if you are just losing access to your network (wireless still operates but can't access resources/internet), then it's likely some kind of configuration problem. you may want to refer to the forum sticky for network setup tips.
it's the router that has the issue. thanks for the help.
