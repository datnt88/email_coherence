hello, i have a small home office with 3 machines running win xp pro. how do i set up an encrypted vpn in my own small network? is there a good tutorial? regards, mirza
all the versions i've used already have encryption turned on. what version are you using? the tutorial in most cases is not generic unless you are presenting to management. if for the it staffer you get the tutorial for the vpn that is in use at their site. bob
you can setup a vpn using a vpn router or even with windows xp. please go thru these two links   thanks l8ians
