i have 3 pc and one cable line. they are sharing the internet through a router and 2 wireless cards. i am thinking of getting a new mac will this create a nightmare?? will the new blue tooth technology in the mac recognise router?? or can i connect the router to the mac and have the other 2 pc connect to it thru the wireless card???
if ur gonna have one mac then let the pc have control of all the router settings and ect. ur mac should have built in wireless so theoretically you should be able to connect to ur router. and the other pc can use the wireless card.
dsl/cable modem -&gt; wifi router -&gt; macs and pcs. works fine. think it over. we go to a hotspot and we use mac or pc without much fuss. bob
it should work then. thanks. first time posting here what quick responses!!!
i am good with the pc's know them pretty well. i can open them to add memory, hard drives, and various cards, but i know nothing about mac's but, i guess when apples says &quot;right out of the box&quot; it could be so. i just thought it was too good to be true.
