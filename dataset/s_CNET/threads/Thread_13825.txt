12185	2	194022	2094721	2094679	cibeen	7/27/06 2:07 am	1.15396602e12	thank you for the link	many of those link are the source articles for configuring my devices and end up like what i wrote on the first post. i hope i can find some other working idea here... one thing i didn't try is enabling upnp service on befsr41... is there a security issue for enabling upnp? thank you again
