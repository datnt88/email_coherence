(code 41)&quot; i've tried using system restore to get it back to it's previous state but it keeps saying that it couldn't restore. i was trying to load some copies of programs yesterday and tried to use some patches and cracks on them so i think that's what might've done it. any idea on how i could fix this? thanks, jon
