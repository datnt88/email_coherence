<s> my note book battery recently has taken a turn for the worse.  </s>
<s> it fully charges in about 15 minutes and discharges in 5 minutes.  </s>
<s> the battery has been handled properly and charged/fully discharged a few times a week (the battery is only 6 months old).  </s>
<s> i think the problem may be w/ the power management portion of the software.  </s>
<s> any ideas i can try besides buying an expensive new battery?  </s>
<s> most laptops have a one year warranty.  </s>
<s> use it. the expense of a new motherboard will just upset you.  </s>

<s> i'm having the exact same problems with my notebook battery.  </s>
<s> i'm very sure that is isn't a software problem, because i've swapped the hard drive and performed a fresh windows installation.  </s>
<s> i've also updated the bios of my notebook (pb e3255), but even that wasn't the solution.  </s>
<s> so if it isn't the software, it's the hardware.  </s>
<s> with this in mind, i began to brainstorm and i figured out this: the battery isn't dead of weak, but &quot;he thinks&quot; he is. the solution to this problem is do completely discharge the battery, so that's what i'm doing now.  </s>
<s> first windows shutdown my notebook because the silly os thought that the battery was running low (4% to go..).  </s>
<s> after being shutdown, my notebook didn't want to start again because he still &quot;thought&quot; that the battery was empty.  </s>
<s> so i took the battery out, and i've put it back in after 10 seconds.  </s>
<s> after pressing the on button, the notebook boots up and keeps beeping that his battery is empty.  </s>
<s> he's doing that now for the last 45 minuits until he's really empty.  </s>
<s> i'll post my results tonight, when i'm sertan that this is the sollution.  </s>
<s> with kind regards, le chuck  </s>
