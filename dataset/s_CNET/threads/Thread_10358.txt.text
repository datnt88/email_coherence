i am a real organize freak and a thing that really bugs me are random files that have been installed on my second harddrive. when i double click on that harddrive it opens it up and brings me with the folders i have put on it, but also things that have been in stalled in the past. two of the folders on there are just a bunch of numbers. also there is a file called &quot;wutempt&quot;, and &quot;msdownload.tmp&quot; and four ffast files. is there anyway i can move these without hurting anything.
your choice on the matter. wutemp was a windows update temporary directory. i've seen some delete it without harm. if your post has typographic errors, i'd show some neatnic tendency and offer a correction. bob
lol k i just deleted teh ones with temp and i put the others in a folder. hopefully everything goes well.
if you have ms office, take it's functions out of &quot;startup&quot; and turn off &quot;fastfind&quot; which is what the &quot;ff&quot; stuff usually is. also, if your os is xp, you can probably turn off system restore for drives you just use for storage because it won't save those for you.
