i am using windows xp sp2 with bullguard and i use ntl cable broadband on a single pc but somtimes my connection goes and then try turing bullguard off but that only works for five minutes , so i have to restart my pc, which is annyoing, is it a software/hardware problem or just one of them things
my advice to everybody using dsl or cablemodem is to buy a router to separate your pc from the naked internet. you will still be scanned and probed but it will all be directed at the router operating system. when was the last time anybody read about a major netgear or dlink vulnerability? you might want to log into  and locate their free, online virus scan. it will not fix your problem but it will let you know if you have one or not. another big hassle is adware and spyware. kazaa is the best way to hose a machine and bring you back to the age of dialup. beware of the free filesharing software. load it on an older pc that you do not care about and then copy the useful files to your main machine. skrall
i am wondering if it best to use a wireless router becuase of the securtity risk and maybe cable be better and also added information bullguard also says that sombody has been scannig and attacking my ports but it also says that and the ip adrees isnt the same as mine
if you buy a new router, most of them support wpa-psk security. as long as your wireless card supports it as well you should be fine. but if you really worry about security then get a wired only router. these days it typically takes about 15 minutes before some hacker finds your computer and starts probing. skrall
