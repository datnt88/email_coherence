do new keyboards work with older computers? specifically, do they work when you are starting up your computer and you need to go into safe mode or run the bios
they don't work on all systems properly. you'd be better off finding a cheap ps2 keyboard. you might check with a local pc builder to see if they could offer you a used one for a couple bucks.
this -&gt;  that never works. when it does, the keyboard or mouse came with that thing. here's a new ps2 keybaord that will work fine with the old gear.  there are plenty others out there. bob
i plugged in the keyboard to a usb port, and i hit f2 during start up and the bios window came up. i will buy a ps/2 keyboard later to free up a usb port so that i have an extra one to use.
