<s> hi - not sure if there's anything that can be done however i live in an area jammed full with wifi networks.  </s>
<s> lately i notice more and more difficulty with my own network dropping me, reducing range, etc. i already have an external omnidirectional antenna added onto my linksys. is there a brand of router that could be recommended with more power or a way to boost the power of my existing network?  </s>
<s> it could be my apartment building at fault but i doubt it only as things worked fine for the first few months we were here.  </s>
<s> day by day i've seen more networks spring up.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance - matt  </s>
<s> i assume you have tried using different channels on your router and changing the location of it within your apartment?  </s>
<s> sometimes that can help.  </s>
<s> you can also get interference from other things, cordless phones, microwaves, etc. a lot of things use the same frequency range.  </s>
<s> one way around that, is to change over to the wireless a standard (instead of the b/g).  </s>
<s> this runs on higher and less used frequencies.  </s>
<s> of course you would have to buy a new router/wireless cards that support this standard.  </s>
<s> i have heard of people creating &quot;shields&quot; and what not, but i don't know how practical or useful that is.  </s>
<s> perhaps some other folks will have better ideas for you.  </s>
<s> this is not like radio broadcasting.  </s>
<s> you are sharing what ever bandwidth that is available with the other users (just like the freeway).  </s>
<s> today there is no &quot;easy button&quot; or tool to automate wap placement and frequency allocations.  </s>
<s> at least not in the under 6 figure price ranges.  </s>
<s> so put your thinking cap on and make a map of your campus then put the waps on the map.  </s>
<s> identify which is at what channel and then just like you do with cellular towers try to keep waps off the same channels when they are next to each other.  </s>
<s> if you planning is good you can keep it to channels 1, 5 and 11 (some use the 1, 6 and 11 combo) to help with overlaps.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'm actually just one apartment in a building and neighbourhood with literally tons of wifi including a citywide net just going online.  </s>
<s> i've tried multiple channels to no avail.  </s>
<s> can i assume if i'm the strongest signal on a channel occupied with other people that i'll have the least problem?  </s>
<s> compared to being on a channel with someone else who has an equally strong signal?  </s>
<s> keep moving...  </s>
<s> last question, i promise.  </s>
<s> technically, can i use *any* of channels 1-11?  </s>
<s> there's always a &quot;but&quot; and it's this. the channels overlap when you use them.  </s>
<s> there is splatter from channel 1 to 2 and so on.  </s>
<s> you'll see responses to try 1, 5 and 11. or 1, 6 and 11.  </s>
<s> why this is so is because it moves you far away from traffic on the other 2 channels.  </s>
