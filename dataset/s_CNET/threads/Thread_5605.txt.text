my dell monitor shows the dell logo while booting up but then goes blank and i see nothing after that and the power light goes from green to amber. if i shut the power off and turn it back on i can see my desk top for a split second. i have to pc exactly the same so i took the monitor off the other pc and put it on the one with the monitor issues. i got the same results so i thought it was a video card issue. next i took the monitor that won't display and hooked it up to the other pc and it did the same thing! so now i am confused as to what i can eliminate next to figure out what is wrong. i have even switched the cables and get the same results. if it were a bad monitor i would think the monitor from the other machine would work but it doesn't. and if it were the video card the monitor that is not working on my pc would work on the other pc but it doesn't!! i'm pulling my hair out now!!
since no os is noted, no models either i'll offer the usual. 1. boot safe mode (no, i don't tell how. look on google.) 2. if windows shows up, set the video mode to 800x600 and ok your way back to the windows screen. 3. click start and restart the machine. sorry for the lack of detail but this is all about learning how to find information. bob
sorry about not enough details. it is a dell dimension 4100 running xp sp2. i will try that thank you. it was running fine and then this just happened out of the blue. i did not make any changes to the display settings before it happened.
i tried what you said and it didn't work. since i can turn the power to the monitor on and see the screen for a split second i did get it to boot in safe mode and then changed the display settings. it still does the same thing.
try 640x480 mode and look, find, set the refresh rate to 60hz. it's also possible it is firing up on the other vga output. many install a newer video card and why you report happens. bob
