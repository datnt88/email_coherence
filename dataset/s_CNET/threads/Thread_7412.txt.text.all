<s> my daughter is moving into an apartment complex that is supplying wi-fi for the whole complex.  </s>
<s> she has a 3-4 year old dell desktop and has been using cable for her internet.  </s>
<s> what is the best way for her to connect to the wi-fi, usb adapter or a pci card also, would it pay her to purchase 802.11n draft or 802.11g.  </s>
<s> if a slot is provided.  </s>
<s> they're easy to install and configure and they stay firmly parked in the laptop.  </s>
<s> 802.11g should be fine.  </s>
<s> there won't be an advantage with the n draft...especially if it's not implemented in the apartment complex.  </s>
<s> when he turned that desktop into a laptop.  </s>
<s> that said, get a pci wireless nic for the desktop, stay away from usb units.  </s>
<s> he is correct in that unless the complex provides -n, just stick with -g. unless you can find a -n unit on sale as they are backward compatible.  </s>
<s> wayne click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software (and a great chocolate-cherry cobbler recipe).  </s>
<s> there are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't.  </s>
<s> pci of the type that has a detachable antenna and cable that's not fixed to the card will be less limiting as you can move the antenna for best signal strength  </s>
<s> i disagree about the g vs n....always get the best technology you can afford....cuz if she moves and the next place has n and she wants more speed, she'll have to cough up more cash...what a waste.  </s>
<s> and she has more flexibility with wi-fi usb...she can just pull it out and nobody can surf for garbage when she is not around  </s>
