7978	3	116365	1323063	1323024	steven haninger	7/26/05 6:38 pm	1.12240308e12	my externals	i have three of them. these are slightly warm to the touch. because the cases are aluminum and not plastic, they should conduct heat better. they are not vented or have a fan. some feature cooling fins or a fan. my reading is that these fans are often a weakness....cheaply made...and i can believe it. my drives feel no warmer than the ones in my case and maybe a bit cooler. the only problem i needed to deal with is that one drive is a little slower to spin up than the rest. it would not always show up in windows when starting the pc. this was corrected by a bios setting which allowed some extra detection time. hope that helps.

7978	20	116365	1335363	1334769	steven haninger	8/2/05 4:43 am	1.12295778e12	i've heard this both ways	the story i heard was more about older style 5 1/4 drives. we called them ''winchesters''. with these you did low and high level formatting during which you adjusted the &quot;interleave&quot; factor which was the number of disk rotations between read/write operations which allowed time for the heads to move into proper position. 1 to 3 interleaving was common with early drives. these were heavier units and the logic was that gravity had an affect on components...especially the heads. it was said that these could sag and tracking could change when turned 90 degrees. thus, with these drives, you compensated by performing low and high level formatting in the position the drive would be running. with ide drives, you no longer low level format at end user level and i have heard/read that changing the orientation of the drive is not the issue it once was. however, i still format a drive after installing it permanently just as a habit.
