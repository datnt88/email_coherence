<s> okay, i know there have been several postings already about wired routers to wireless routers, and i have looked thru some of the stickys.  </s>
<s> i'm just looking for some clarification / validation on this information due to i have a somewhat unique situation.  </s>
<s> okay, here is the background.  </s>
<s> i have an exhibit at a local childrens museum that i take care of. it uses internet to get new updates every night.  </s>
<s> up until a few months ago, it was working fine.  </s>
<s> now the computer cannot connect to the network, therefore no internet.  </s>
<s> i've switched ethernet cables, but it still does not work.  </s>
<s> i had a friend of mine who has some network experience who took a look and said he believes there is a problem with the ethernet cable between where my exhibit is located and where the router is.  </s>
<s> now, my exhibit is located on the 2nd floor in the north-east corner, while the router is located on the 1st floor in the south-west corner.  </s>
<s> just replacing the router with a wireless router will not work because of the amount of steel/concrete structure between the two locations, a signal just will not get thru.  </s>
<s> on the same floor as my exhibit, there is a working ethernet cable in the opposite corner of the room (about 50 feet away).  </s>
<s> museum officials do not want cable strung across the ceiling, nor routed along the floorboard behind the trim.  </s>
<s> what they will allow me to do is put a wireless router up there, then i could use a wireless adapter on the computer for my exhibit.  </s>
<s> okay, so now that you have all of the background, i'm just wondering, can i put a wireless router in place, and plug the ethernet cable (which is of course plugged into a wired port on the router downstairs) just plug that into the internet port of the wireless router?? what configurations would i have to do in the wireless router to connect with the router downstairs in order to distribute the internet.  </s>
<s> once i have the routers talking to each other and working properly, i will be turning off the ssid as museum officials do not want the area becoming a wi-fi hotspot. the only thing it will be used for is my exhibit connection.  </s>
<s> any advice / support would be greatly appreciated!!!  </s>
<s> even this forum's sticky notes this.  </s>
<s> sorry that the first link died and i'll update that when i have the time and find it.  </s>
<s> so yup.  </s>
<s> read it's done all the time.  </s>
<s> but the only clarification is that we turn the wifi router into a wifi wap.  </s>
<s> you could buy a wap but since with just a little settings you can use any common wifi router.  </s>
<s> bob ps. if you are within a few hundred miles of boston i would volunteer to help you in person.  </s>
<s> thanks for the posting.  </s>
<s> i'll be sure to take a look.  </s>
<s> thanks for the offer too, but unfortunately i'm in central illinois, which is more than a couple hundred miles of boston!  </s>
<s> thanks for all your help!! i appreciate it!! i'll be glad to get this exhibit back up and running again.  </s>
