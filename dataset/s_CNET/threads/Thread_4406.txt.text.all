<s> hey all- i was wondering what i need for these situations: - my laptop on the go - what tech do i need to have a reliable internet connection most of the time ($100-250 dollar range).  </s>
<s> -could i replace my cable with a router or something?  </s>
<s> i have 2 desktop and 3 laptops.  </s>
<s> but i heard routers are unreliable; would making the switch be the right and cheap choice?  </s>
<s> as one in the laptop forum.  </s>
<s> but, there are enough differences in the text to make it unclear as to your goal.  </s>
<s> you mention being &quot;on the go&quot; but having laptops and desktops.  </s>
<s> as well, you ask about replacing your cable with a router.  </s>
<s> these are not interchangeable items.  </s>
<s> each does something completely different.  </s>
<s> you might ask that your posts be removed and put together a new one that defines more specifically what you want to do and what problems you are having.  </s>
<s> when i say &quot;laptop on the go&quot; i mean that i want to know what i can do to have wireless internet access on my high school campus.  </s>
<s> is placing a router in my locker feasible?  </s>
<s> that sorta thing.  </s>
<s> by &quot;replacing&quot; a cable modem with a wireless router, i meant that could i use a wireless router or some similar device to power reliable internet access in my home for both laptops and desktops instead of using a cable modem which i pay expensive monthly fees for.  </s>
<s> that's pretty much it.  </s>
<s> simple too.  </s>
<s> a router doesn't give you internet access.  </s>
<s> it's a piece of hardware that needs to be connected to another piece...generally a broadband modem. the modem connects to an internet service provider...generally by phone line or coax cable depending on whether it's cable or dsl.  </s>
<s> of course fiber optic is growing as well.  </s>
<s> you can't put any piece of hardware in your school that will originate an internet connection.  </s>
<s> does your school not have a network with internet access already?  </s>
<s> it's the same deal at your home.  </s>
<s> you cannot toss out the cable modem and use a router.  </s>
<s> in fact, you will want both. the router cannot reach out and grab an internet connection.  </s>
<s> it needs to connect to a modem.  </s>
<s> &quot;modem&quot; means &quot; mo ulator- dem odulator.  </s>
<s> it converts the incoming and outgoing signals to the isp from and to a modulated signal that can carry the long distances that a purely digital signal cannot.  </s>
<s> this means it's on a high frequency &quot;carrier&quot;...going for a ride. the carrier is added at one end and removed at the other.  </s>
<s> your router cannot handle the signal that enters your house.  </s>
<s> i hope this is clear.  </s>
