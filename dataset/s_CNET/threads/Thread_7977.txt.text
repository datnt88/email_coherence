our pc (hp- a1330n pavilion) stops making noise, monitor goes dark(sleep) but on/off button stays lit. nothing we do will bring it back and we can not turn off from switch(button), it must be unplugged from power supply and re-plugged in. we have our hp plugged into an apc power back-up/monitor both systems are around 3yrs old. a few months ago i remember a message coming up saying the battery in the apc unit was old and should be replace, which was never done. any thoughts or solutions to this problem will be appreciated. hyghwayman
and you tried another power source aside from plugging it in to apc?
hi hyghwayman, i work for hp and saw your message and want to help if i can. tip: one thing you can do to shutdown your pc without unplugging it is to press and hold down the power button for 5 seconds. i'm trying to better understand your problem. did this just start happening? did it occur after installing any hardware or software, even a windows update? you might want to try updating your bios:  this hp support document looks like it may help:  it could also be that your pc is overheating. perhaps it needs to be cleaned?  i hope this helps. let us know how it goes. --although i am an hp employee, i am speaking for myself and not for hp.--
my desktop did the same thing. turned out to be the power supply. $35 and a minute or so to fix.
