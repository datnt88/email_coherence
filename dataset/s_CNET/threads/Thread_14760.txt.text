being received from a canon mp830 ... i've always had hp printers until last week, and those hp printers had a setting to block junk faxes ... if there was a number shown on the incoming fax. i cannot find any info re doing this with the canon ... either in the user's guide or in their online help. does anyone with a canon know if this is possible? thanks.
and that's a pricey model too. you'll have to consider add on devices you find with  bob
your phone company may have a &quot;do not contact&quot; list that you can sign up for. mine is free but requires me to block all phone and fax of members of the do not contact list and of course does not cover companies that are not members.
for the information in your post. i don't think i want to pay that much. the good news is that i'm not inundated with junk faxes yet ... so i'm going to change my attitude and just live with it. i appreciate the links.
list. i'm on the national do not call list, but apparently, it's not working in this case! i'm going to look into that through my local phone carrier. thanks for the suggestion.
