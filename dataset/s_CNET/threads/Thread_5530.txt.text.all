<s> i have a four+ year old dell desktop with a geforce3 ti 200 graphics card.  </s>
<s> i want to upgrade to a card with more dedicated memory preparing for adding vista later.  </s>
<s> don't play graphics intensive games.  </s>
<s> could anyone please confirm my old card is in an agp slot?  </s>
<s> 2x/4x or 4x/8x??? any recommendations for models,brands or store would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> all pc's with agp slots made after 2000 are 4x or 4x/8x, so any agp card will do.  </s>
<s> for vista, go with at least a radeon x series or geforce 6000 series or later card (avoid geforce 4/fx5000 and radeon 90000 series).  </s>
<s> earlier cards may lack driver support and aren't really saving you any significant money.  </s>
<s> you only need 128mb since you're not a gamer.  </s>
<s> here's a perfect $41 card for you and the absolute cheapest card you should consider:  </s>
<s> many thanks ramarc!  </s>
<s> just the help i was looking for.  </s>
<s> appreciate it.  </s>
