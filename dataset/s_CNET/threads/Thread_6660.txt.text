hey guys. i'm makin my own rig in a few months hopefully and my friend brought up a cool idea. he was wondering if there was a type of cd drive where you just insert the cd into like in a car. i had never thought about that. is there such a thing for pcs?
slot loading drives are known to have a little trouble with mini-media or smaller diameter cds. so there it is. &quot;slot loading.&quot; bob
i haven't seen any available for the last few years.
damn, that would of been real cool :/ more expensive but cool. thanks for your reply.
