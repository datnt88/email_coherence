<s> i was at office max yesterday and saw two routers on sale.  </s>
<s> they appeared to be exactly the same router, except that one was &quot;draft&quot; n and the other was just &quot;n&quot;. the draft n was about $20 bucks cheaper.  </s>
<s> i live far out in the country and the beavers and turkeys out here are of the non laptop carrying types, so i really have no need for security and encryption, but i do have a tremendous need for range. is there anyhting to fear from the draft n vs. n? i think both were dlink routers.  </s>
<s> older (less than 6 mo.) technology than &quot;n&quot;. the w3c has a final version of the standard (&quot;n&quot;) but, as of now, has not given it its blessing.  </s>
<s> it will.  </s>
<s> and life goes on... jack  </s>
<s> since wireless n (802.11n) specs have not been finalized, there is no gaurantee 802.11n routers from one company (eg linksys) would work together problem-free with 802.11n adapters from another company (e.g. netgear or d-link).  </s>
<s> as long as you buy the matched pair (wireless n router and adapter), you should just look for which pair gives you the best range.  </s>
<s> with unmatched pairs (even within the same brand)you may end up having to run both in basic 802.11g mode. the $20 price difference is nothing compare to the hassles you can get with incompatible router's and adapters when non-final wireless specs are involved.  </s>
