from amazon, just want to make sure this will work ok from my graphics card to my 1080i toshiba flatscreen.
i wouldn't expect you to have any problems with that cable. the only hdmi cables i've ever had any problems with have been the free ones i got from comcast. frys once had 6' hdmi cables on sale for $2 each, and i bought 6 of them. not one of them has given me any problems. for $6 you aren't risking much to give it a shot. good luck.
this cable will give me a better picture than my dvi cable is that true?
dvi and hdmi signals are identical and digital. i've never seen any change. bob
than i won't waste the $6
i know hdmi cables carry both sound and video and vga (rgb) cables carry video only. do dvi cables carry sound as well as video? since the dvi connections i've seen come out of the graphics card, i'm inclined to doubt it.
i have a vga cable right now and wonder if the hdmi would show a marked improvement...digger
and i can't tell the difference. but i bet someone could if they tried hard enough. hdmi is however required for some setups. such as bluray playback. bob
i can't see a difference, unless someone posts some specs, for most i don't think there is. even, if you use vga, i'm sure if you look closely see if an audio port is present as well, many have that too, just need the typical pc audio cable. my setup has it and i connect my laptop vga and audio to the tv. tada ------willy
