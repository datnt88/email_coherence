<s> hello,the question i have is how do they troubleshoot deskjet printers hardware problems.do they use a cd that tells them,or do they use scopes,multimeters,etc? just curious on there process.  </s>
<s> thanks,edward  </s>
<s> the brutal reality is that in the us even a 200 buck printer may &quot;cost too much to fix&quot; so such diagnostics and tools and even a service manual will never be found.  </s>
<s> small parts like ink cartridges are always replacable. the move to a disposable printer grinds some people the wrong way but it explains why nearly nothing is available as to manuals and diagnostics.  </s>
<s> in closing, even if you found what part you needed, it's not in stock.  </s>
<s> cheers, bob  </s>
<s> thanks bob i appreciate the explanation.  </s>
