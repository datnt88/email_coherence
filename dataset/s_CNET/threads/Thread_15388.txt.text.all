<s> hi, can someone cofirm that panasonic cordless dect phones handset : kx-tg6300, kx-tg9300 : like kx-tg6311s, kx-tg9342t have mute facility.  </s>
<s> looking at the phone : it does not have a mute button.  </s>
<s> however they are listed as mute capable and listed as yes in technical specs on cnet too : mute/flash buttons yes (soft key)/yes (flash/call wait) so is it a soft key that functions as mute button.  </s>
<s> does it work.  </s>
<s> has anyone used it and does it work. is it complicated to get it to work?  </s>
<s> other panasonic dect cordless like kx-tg8231b kx-tg1032s have a specific mute button.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> hi i don't know if this helps, on the kx-tg832 the mute key is not labelled but the the &quot;clear&quot; button (bottom-right of the joystick) is used for this purpose.  </s>
<s> i have the panasonic kx-tg8322al, does anyone know if you can turn the display screen on the handsets of while docked??? i have one near my bed and it is bright and annoying...  </s>
