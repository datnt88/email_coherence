i am running windows xp with service pack 2 , and i am installing ati catalyst 5.3(the latest version) , my card is &quot;ati radeon 9000&quot; , recently , in the middle of the games , the system reboots , i tried more than ane game but all are the same , after 15 to 30 mins of the game the machine reboots , and my processor's fan is working fine , this issue doesn't happen at all at applications except games , that's why i believe it's a driver issue ,the games i tried are c&c generals , nhl 2005 and fifa 2005 . any suggestions? thanx in advance
but it sounds a lot like an overheat issue. did you install the graphics card recently, or just update the drivers? even if the fan works, it could still be heating up from the increased load.
i guess so , but this is a new issue , if it was heating , it would have occured long time ago , i bought this card 2 years ago , and it worked fine until now
i would suggest reinstalling the drivers, just in case something went wrong on the install. also, if it works, install an older version of the driver. thats probably not the best solution, but it's a workaround at least.
trust me, it's not a driver issue. the problem lies somewhere else in the computer, not your graphics card. games and other very large applications tend to use a lot of memory, and will crush if you don't have enough ram. when a gpu overheats, you start seeing artifacts. it won't prompt the computer to restart immediately.
