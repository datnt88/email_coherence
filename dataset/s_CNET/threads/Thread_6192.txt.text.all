<s> i have a toshiba laptop i would like know if i can upgrade to windows 7 my os is toshiba satellite p205pbou-00w008 serial num.37255263k.  </s>
<s> processor 1.87gig intel core duo 64kb drives 118.46gig.  </s>
<s> will it be no problme also like to know to upgrade my harddrive to 250g or higher would like fullversion of windows 7  </s>
<s> that's not a bad machine.  </s>
<s> i would hit the toshiba web site and see if the drivers are available for it for windows 7. bob  </s>
<s> you shouldn't need any toshiba drivers.  </s>
<s> (i installed win7 on a similar toshiba and everything worked except the bluetooth.) if you're ok with reinstalling all your apps from scratch, just get a replacement hard drive, install it in the laptop, and do clean install of win7.  </s>
<s> $70 wd scorpio black: $60 wd scorpio blue: the blue is 5400rpm, the black is 7200rpm... well worth the $10.  </s>
<s> thank you for the info.  </s>
<s> now when you said do a clean install of win7 does that come with the upgrade disk of win7 or is that a seperate program.  </s>
<s> also should i go to win7 upgrade or full version.  </s>
<s> put the win7 disc in your dvd and boot from the dvd.  </s>
<s> choose custom install and let it whack your existing windows installation on c:. when you're done, you'll find a windows.old  </s>
<s> folder that has all of your old documents & settings and the old windows tree.  </s>
<s> but don't depend on that windows.old folder -- backup your valuables before doing the clean install!  </s>
<s> thank you for the info.  </s>
<s> that great i'll will start on as soon as possiable.  </s>
<s> again thank you.  </s>
