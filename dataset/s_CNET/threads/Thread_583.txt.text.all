<s> i'm in the market for a new desktop and would like some advice on making the right selection.  </s>
<s> my primary use is for viewing and editing photos using photoshop.  </s>
<s> i plan on upgrading to the most current edition of photoshop along with the purchase of the desktop.  </s>
<s> i won't be upgrading my monitor.  </s>
<s> could you make some recomendations as far as system requirements to help me select a system?  </s>
<s> i have a hp computer with amd 4200 duel core processor and 2 gig of ram.  </s>
<s> i am using photoshop cs2 and that combination seems to work great.  </s>
<s> after i bought the computer i added the 2nd gig of ram and a 256mg video card and did see better performance.  </s>
<s> i also do video editing through the firewire port and so far nothing seems to slow it down. the graphics forum on cnet has a lot of good information so you might check there.  </s>
<s> most any new system today would probably work out for what you are looking to do - the biggest factor may be price.  </s>
<s> if you are looking for a system with good performance you should be able to find multiple choices for around $500-600 that would come with the complete system, a 19&quot; flat panel monitor, and a basic printer.  </s>
<s> i would start with the major oems such as dell, hp/compaq, or sony and see what you can configure as your best price.  </s>
<s> don't hesitate to call them and see if they can improve the deal as well - they often have unadvertised specials and incentives that can get you a great system at a great price.  </s>
<s> if you are looking for something specific or a certain brand and would like some more help or have other questions post back and i'll see what i can do.  </s>
