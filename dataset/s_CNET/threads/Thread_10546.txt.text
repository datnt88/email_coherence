i have a idotconnect metal gear box 3.5&quot; hard drive. the box reads 3.5&quot; ide to usb 2.0/1394a i lost the power adapter for this hard drive and all my stuff is on it.. it's 6-pin and it says &quot;dc in&quot; where it plugs in to the hard drive. i've been googling this company, the product, the adapter.. i cant find anything with this pin layout.. is this a typo?? i found something similar, with the 5v and the gnd reversed.. see pic below
get a new enclosure. i owned a few of those speed metal drives and that enclosure is not special. bob
having your link explains alot(thanks). as robert offered, replacing the enclosure would be the better fix &quot;if&quot; you can't find another ac wart. plus, the cost may push you into getting a new enclosure anyways, if you found one. i also consider this an unique adapter, because of the dual-voltages, so it becomes harder to replace. check these links:   -or- google away for surplus or used parts vendors. tada -----willy
i just need to get the data off this hard drive first.. but i need to power it up! what should i be searching for? is there a specific name for this kind of adapter?
and plug it into a port on your computer's motherboard. it should be either ide (pata) or sata, if no port is available, disconnect one from such as a cd rom or secondary hard drive. plug that drive in and pull off what you need. good luck.
as explained to you the simple fix was to replace the enclosure. the new enclosure would have the required ac adapter. you swap hd out and then use the new enclosure to access data. once done, you have the new enclosure as a working ext. hd again. if that doesn't work provided all was done correctly, then you have some true or 2ndary fault to deal with. also, steven's suggestion to gain access for data alone, provided you have the required port and cabling, use a desktop pc and mount it as an int. hd in proper setup. either way will work to gain access to data.
try this one.  jim
