my dell laptop has been used some years, and it seems something wrong with the laptop ac adapter, so i bought a new dell pa-12 ac adapter from  , the new one is good, but i still want to know, if the old one can be repaired, who can give some advice? thanks.
since you ask, i am going to assumed that you will be taken it to a repair shop. my guess is that you won't be able to do it for under $10 (if it is something obvious and simple) and really hurting for business. but who knows..give it a shot
you might want to provide us with more details on your old adapter because not all faults are repairable. however, if you don't mind the hassle of bringing it down to a repair shop to check it out, then just do so. they will be able to advice you whether your adapter is repairable and at what cost. at the end of the day you will need to decide whether it's worth while to fix it.
