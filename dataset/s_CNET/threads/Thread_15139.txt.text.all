<s> i'm building a pc for someone else and i want to make sure everything's compatible before ordering.  </s>
<s> i've checked and it looks like they work, but i wanna make sure.  </s>
<s> here's the parts: case: enermax blue aluminum atx mid tower case with 400w psu, model &quot;10mcs-56881lbfs-d3&quot; -retail motherboard: intel &quot;boxd915pcyl&quot; 915p chipset motherboard for intel lga 775 cpu -retail processor: intel lga 775 pentium 4 520 2.8 ghz, 800mhz fsb, 1mb l2 cache, hyper threading technology - retail memory: crucial 240-pin dimm 512 ddr2 from crucial.com video card: aati radeon x700 pro video card, 256mb ddr, 128-bit, dvi/tv-out, pci-express, model &quot;100-437402&quot; -retail floppy drive: nec 1.44mb black internal floppy drive, oem cd-rom drive: samsung black 52x32x52 cd-rw drive, model sw-252senb, oem bulk hard drive: western digital 120gb 7200rpm sata hard drive, model wd1200jd, oem drive only  </s>
<s> not be compatible.  </s>
<s> i don't like buying cases with the power supply because the supply is usually a low bid item.  </s>
<s> i know that enermax makes power supplies, but they make cheapies and good ones. the good ones have the &quot;true power&quot; in their name, meaning that they actually provide the full rating 100% of the time.  </s>
<s> for the cheapies the ratings are for the peak wattage.  </s>
<s> bump. any other advice?  </s>
<s> goto the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> support website.  </s>
<s> in some cases they provide a listing of known good tested compoents that work with thier mtrbd.. usually, that implies at least ram, but other componets may need clarification.  </s>
<s> besides the website provides the known specs on what it supports.  </s>
<s> most off-shelf componets are going to work if compatible(usually are) and rarely do you see an issue. the only time you get into trouble if you oc or speed tweak too far, but defaults work well.  </s>
<s> power supplies are the foundation of a good and *stable* system so if flaky problems arise, look into that area if not in the beginning but later within 3-4 mo. isn't uncommon to see reboots or an further added componet tip the stable scale.  </s>
<s> of course don't forget good cooling of the system case and componets, this too can add stress that overtime will degrade componets or just generally start flakiness.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
