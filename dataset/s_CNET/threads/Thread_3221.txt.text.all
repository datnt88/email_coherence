i have a 320 gb wd external hard drive and i wanted to replace the hd in my laptop with it and both use sata connectors and same form factor just wanted to know if it was possible to do this with windows 7. 
a sata drive is a sata drive. 
99% of the time there is no issue if the mechanical fit is fine. 
there are very few exceptions.
