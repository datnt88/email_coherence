<s> ok i'm new at this and after debating for a while i want to upgrade my dell xps 420 (that's a few years old), i'm looking to put some money into it.  </s>
<s> right now everything is stock, intel quad q6600 2.4ghz cpu, 500gb hd, 3gb ram, 375w psu w/ dual 12v rails @ 18a each, and a radeon hd 2400 pro (32-bit vista).  </s>
<s> i found out that i have a dell otp406 mainboard/motherboard with x38 chipset.  </s>
<s> i'd like to oc my cpu to about 3.0-3.2ghz,  </s>
<s> but i think my bios is locked, is an over-clock even necessary?  </s>
<s> so far my plan's are to reformat the hd and install windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit) home premium, add 1gb stick ram, put in a corsair tx650 watt psu that has a single 12v rail @ 53a and decide on a mid-range gpu (msi 560ti?). i ultimately want to connect this pc to my 40&quot; 1080p lcd tv via hdmi, will a screen that big cause problems running a proper resolution @ x1080?  </s>
<s> i'd like to be able to play game's such as skyrim, bf3, crisis etc...with possible mods on high-ultra.  </s>
<s> will this work?  </s>
<s> i want to try and keep this mobo/cpu.  </s>
<s> any input/advice is greatly appreciated, this is my first attempt at a pc hardware build/upgrade any help is huge, thank you in advance.  </s>
<s> we had a similar hp d4999t and d5000t that we replaced the video card to go 1080p.  </s>
<s> we didn't need to change the cpu speed.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> could i do it with: dell otp406 motherboard w/ x38 chip intel core 2 quad q6600 2.4ghz cpu 650w psu w/ single 12v @53a hd 6870/6850 gpu specifically on a 40&quot; display @ x1080 resolution?  </s>
<s> 4 gb ram  </s>
<s> here it was not the cpu at issue or bottleneck.  </s>
