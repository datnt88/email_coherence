<s> a co-worker of mine is having problems with a noisy hard drive.  </s>
<s> the hd appears to be &quot;working&quot; (hd light flashing along with the noisy &quot;clicking&quot; coming from the hd itself), but it will do this continuously, even when she is not using her computer.  </s>
<s> she is running winxp. the only thing i've found on the matter so far is that the hd is preparing to crash, but this machine is new (about 2 months old) and i have read that crashing is a problem of older noisy drives.  </s>
<s> what could or would be causing the noise?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for your help.  </s>
<s> two months old?  </s>
<s> backup all important files immediately.  </s>
<s> make it a warranty issue.  </s>
<s> did it come with the computer or was it purchased separately?  </s>
<s> hd model number?  </s>
<s> i don't know the hd model number (i posted yesterday, she is out today).  </s>
<s> i am inclined to agree that the hd is faulty, but our latest suspicion is that the computer may not actually be ''new.'' when she received the machine, the case had a few dings on the front, and then the side panel (which you would remove to service it) fell off.  </s>
<s> we were able to put it right back on, but it probably would not have been loose if someone hadn't been inside it to begin with (just suspicions).  </s>
<s> she saves all her work to the server, so she doesn't necessarily risk losing her work, but we are still worried about it.  </s>
<s> and we're very skeptical about the legitimacy of the computer itself.  </s>
