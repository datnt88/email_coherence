i have internet through cable provided by comcast. ever since it's installation i am unable to get wireless access to my ibm r51 laptop (windows xp), although lan works perfectly. i have netgear cable modem gateway cg814wg v2. whenever i try to connect wireless, it initially shows that it's connected followed by the message &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;. however, the wireless works perfectly in my other dell notebook. please help me find a solution.
the message limited or no connectivity, did you try clicking on the message. then click on the repair button. be paitent, it may give you another error message but if you wait a minute longer, it might connect. if it does, then type command ipconfig /flushdns then hit enter then close the window. before you shut down the computer, disable the radio. i found that when the radio is not disabled, i got that error message often. hope this helps. rick
after clicking on repair it says it is unable to &quot;disable the wireless adapter&quot; and to &quot;check wireless network settings&quot;. i don't know what to check in my settings. is there some way to disable my previous settings and set up the whole thing again?
