i bought this video card: nvidia geforce4 mx 420 for my computer to support all my pc games. i have never had a problem until now. when i installed call of duty 2, i got an error message that my video card did not support alpha blending, which was strange to me because i have two other call of duty games as well as many other pc games that never gave me a problem. i looked at the nvidia web site to see about downloading an update, but i'm nervous about picking the correct one. can anybody tell me which download is the right one?
the nvidia drivers are quite nice and won't install unless they work with your card and os. you can't go wrong. bob
bob, i downloaded the driver and while the game can now be played, my regular display setting are distractingly massive. how can i get my display (desktop picture, icon size and internet display, etc.)to be the same size as before? if i use system restore, will it take out the newly downloaded driver? is there another way to change the display? some of the page is so far off the screen that i can't even get to the arrow to move it across the page. sue
remember that i'm going to take everyone as being familiar with how to change the desktop properties and set them to their favorite 800x600 or 1024x768 pixels or such. tell me which you used. bob
found it: 1280 x 960 -- thanks!
