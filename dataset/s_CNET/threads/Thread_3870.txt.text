any thoughts on this one? the e2000 supports dual band (either 2.4 or 5 ghz) while the valet plus only supports 2.4 ghz. but what about the range? i understand the valet plus is easy set up for morons but is the e2000 just as easy with it's cd? most bang for the buck...please chime in!
after install some thousand wifi routers not one stands out among the others for range. it appears that the federal limits on output power means that all are fairly equal. as to setup, after all this i admit i never use the setup cds. it makes me wonder if all their efforts were wasted on me. bob
hi. i have worked with d-link, netgear, huwai, linksys, senoa wireless routers and access points. just a couple of each, therefore not many. however, i checked and found the wireless range of the old &quot;linksys wrt-54g&quot; (the one which came with two antennas),router to be double than others, including linksys' own newer model wap-4400n. the only exception was senoas outdoor router. its range was immense, to say the least. but its output power was also more than others. just a point. navneet.
