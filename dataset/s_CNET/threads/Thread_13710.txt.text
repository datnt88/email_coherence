what is the fastest cpu on the market (that anyone can buy fairly easily). also what is the fastest prosessor for the g5, pentium and amd?
i am not so educated on the g5. however, the fastest processor for amd is the fx-55 and its specs are 2600/1024/htt. and the fastest for intel is the pentium 4 570j and its specs are 3800/1024/800. as christmas nears, intel will release a new p4ee and we will retake the market. that p4ee will be the fastest and its specs will be 3733/2048/1066 making for a speed daemon processor.
the fastest cpu cannot run on a table all by itself. manufacturers of mbs must be in on it too (and ram manufactures also). the availability of the whole package is as important as it is for a single component. these new babies tend to be pricy and tempramental.
athlon 64 fx-55.
the fastest chip on the market to day would have to be the amd athlon 64 fx55. it isn't as versatile as the intel p4ee 3.6ghz chip but it wins hands down in every other category. the lack of ddr2 however, keeps me away from the amd chip for now. but the boards are coming. g5? i have no idea, i don't work with macs, sorry. -mike
which of these processors is the fastest for continuous maths calculations, used in programs that may take many hours to complete the calculations.
fastest cpu is amd fx-55. intel suks now especially with the expensive price and less performance.
the amd fx-55 is faster, but you probably have to be a spoiled rich kid, or make a pretty good wage, to buy the fx-55 from $816-$840 (processor alone - newegg).
now the fastest cpu is the intel core 2 quad q8650. i might have spelled it wrong but anyways it is the fastest as of 08/26/07. damn i got orientation for school tomorrow
