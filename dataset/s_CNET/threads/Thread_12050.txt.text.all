<s> i admittedly am a newbie when it comes to things like this, so i ask: is it better to get a radeon x700 with pciexpress, or a 9800 256mb with agp?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> well if you have a integrated graphics card you know the on board then i would go with agp not pci cause the onboard graphic card will yield to the agp but will give you a fit with pci good luck  </s>
<s> work stick with agp  </s>
