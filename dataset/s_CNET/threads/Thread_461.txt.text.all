<s> would you suggest buying generic printer ink rather than the company ink that costs 5x the price?  </s>
<s> i'm weary of doing this because a friend of mine blames generic ink for breaking his epson... suggestions and opinions?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> epson printers on thier own are a pita.  </s>
<s> they tend to be problematic with any inks even thier own.  </s>
<s> as for any other printer out there, using generic inks is ok but you are at the mercy of that &quot;quality&quot; of inks used.  </s>
<s> simply put, cheap ink is cheap ink.  </s>
<s> i suggest you buy at least from a offcie outlet store like staples, officemax, wal-mart, etc. and enjoy some saving.  </s>
<s> if you plan to refill your own, then buy from a reputable ink refill source, etc.. rememeber, usually the only recourse any refill outlet provides is to replace inks/refilled carts for free if you have problems and they agree to.  </s>
<s> i buy store refills all the time and rarely have problems, however i don't use epson printers, i repaired too many to find them on my desk at home.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i'd be suspicious of what's in a 6 dollar cartridge.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have never seen that sort of price difference.  </s>
<s> but.  </s>
<s> part of the decision imade when buying a printer ws the ink, how it works with different papers etc. introduce a foreign ink, and now the icc profiles for that printer are no longer valid.  </s>
<s> good luck finding an icc profile for generic ink with a particular printer and the particular paper you are using.  </s>
<s> its enough aggravation to find them with the manufactures ink.  </s>
<s> i took a different approach.  </s>
<s> i also own a small laser printer.  </s>
<s> i use that for all my normal printing, saving the color printer for photos and stuff where i truly need color.  </s>
<s> my hp lasers go about a year and a couple of months on one 70.00 laser cartridge.. and they print must faster as well.  </s>
<s> if you choose to use you inkjet and don't care about color, make sure you print as black and white, so at least you are only using the black ink cartridge.  </s>
<s> using a generic ink will violate most warranties.  </s>
<s> generic ink has been known to cause problems.  </s>
<s> if i were to buy generic, i would stick with a known brand from a known supplier so that if there is an issue i know who to go after for printer repair.  </s>
<s> i use generic ink in my epson printer. the economics are simple. the printer itself is now dirt cheap.  </s>
<s> the expected operational life without breakdown of modern inkjet printers seems to be about two years.  </s>
<s> (my current one is 3 years old but has not printed in colour, only black and white for the past 18 months - and will not work at all unless i replace the colour cartridges on a regular basis, no idea where all that ink goes to, but definitely not onto any paper).  </s>
<s> you can use cheap ink and throw the printer away after two years, or use extortionately expensive ink and throw it away after three.  </s>
<s> even if you have to throw it away after one year the savings on the cheaper ink are greater than the cost of the new printer.  </s>
<s> for some reason epson printers suffer from clogged nozzles more than other brands, particularly if you don't use them every day.  </s>
<s> on my last one even the drastic windex treatment failed.  </s>
<s> incidentally i have a 10 year old hp deskjet 500 used once a month or less, and it always works first time without fail. the quality of the print is not as good as on more recent models, but it never fails to deliver what it always did.  </s>
<s> define generic printer ink. the ink sold to be used in all printers should be avoided.  </s>
<s> but if you buy bulk ink intended for your printer from a reliable vender that also has good suppurt such as then you should be okay.  </s>
<s> i have refilled my canon ink jet cartridges so many times i've lost count.  </s>
<s> you have to be willing to learn how to refill the cartidges.  </s>
<s> once you leara how you should have no problems.  </s>
<s> my epson printer has cartridges that require a device to reset factory cartridges and the cartridges are designed in such a way that the ink takes about 24 hours to work.  </s>
<s> this is where a vendor with good support helps.  </s>
<s> follow the directions from the vendor methodically.  </s>
<s> cover the work area with lot of newspaper, have paper towels, etc. available.  </s>
<s> refill the cartridges before they go dry.  </s>
<s> i keep a set of full cartridges ready to put into my printer and then refill the ones i take out immediately.  </s>
<s> i get great results and beautiful photo prints.  </s>
<s> i could not afford to make aa many photos if i had to pay for the printer company cartridges.  </s>
<s> printer are fairly inexpensive because the companies know they'll make huge printer with their cartridges.  </s>
<s> glenn h.  </s>
<s> i'm a bit surprised about the negative comments about epson printers as my 10 year old epson stylus photo that i infrequently use works fine.  </s>
<s> i've used both generic and company inks.  </s>
<s> only reason that i didn't keep using generic inks is that i would typically buy them several at a time to spread out the shipping charge.  </s>
<s> by the time i'd get to the second cartridge, it would already be dry.  </s>
<s> turns out that it was no more expensive to by company inks locally with less loss.  </s>
<s> only issue there is that the inks would start to run out while i'm trying to print something important.  </s>
<s> solution there was to remove the cartridge and shake it some to position more of the ink over the end it comes out off.  </s>
<s> that would typically buy me a few print jobs and i could get a replacement in that time.  </s>
<s> having read the other replies, i will offer my humble opinion.  </s>
<s> you get what you pay for.  </s>
<s> i will use only hp printers and ink.  </s>
<s> i think that if you're only printing letters/documents and using black ink, it most likely wouldn't make musch of a difference.  </s>
<s> however,for photos or professional looking presentations, brochures, decals, tee shirt transfers, or any of the other creative things you can do with your printer, i would want the highest quality printer ink.  </s>
<s> i save by resisting the tempation to print all of my photos (haha), and by setting my printer default to print on &quot;fast draft&quot; automatically (which uses less ink and is perfectly fine for documents and everyday stuff), and then choose the higher quality for printing photos or other things.  </s>
<s> i hope this helps.  </s>
<s> i have used generic inks in both my epson 740(which is still working)and in my current canon ip4000.....never had a problem w/ inks....and there definitely is a savings.  </s>
<s> are all generic inks equal?  </s>
<s> well for my money i've been using insell.com for over 2 yrs and have never had a problem.  </s>
<s> they are great folk to do business w/. infact i will not purchase a printer that i can't use generic inks in.  </s>
<s> my first ever printer was an epson stylus 800, and i still kick myself for using generic ink because the print quality deteriorated to the point that i had to chuck the printer out.  </s>
<s> perhaps generic inks have improved since then.  </s>
<s> i happily use generic toners in my laser printer because a bad cartridge does not damage the actual printer, but if i ever get another inkjet it will be genuine cartridges all the way.  </s>
<s> i buy generic, i have an epson printer and no real problems.  </s>
<s> perhaps my printer doesn't last as long as it would if i bought epson cartridges but as printers are now so cheap it's almost as cheap to buy a new printer as to buy brand name ink.  </s>
<s> i regularly print color manuals for a holistic health practice.  </s>
<s> if i use company inks, it would cost me $40 per manual.  </s>
<s> i use generic inks and drop the cost down to about $4. regular deep cleaning through the printer maintenance routine keeps things chugging along... previously i owned and used epsons, but got tired of the problems and switched to canon.  </s>
<s> i just spent $50 after two years to replace the print head, bringing it back to new status. it is against the law, my understanding, for a company to try and void the warranty on a printer because you use generic ink.  </s>
<s> i also print a lot of photos, and find the generics work just fine.  </s>
<s> i guess we all have different levels of discernment.  </s>
<s> i have used generic inks for a while, to print colour photos, and have no problem with them.  </s>
<s> i am suprised that one one has mentioned continous inking systems.  </s>
<s> you can get a 6 cartridge system from everest inking system for around 35. the tanks hold 6 x 100ml of and costs around 24, although there is cheaper ink available.  </s>
<s> this amount of ink represents about 60 normal cartridges.  </s>
<s> these systems automatically reset the chip so you never have to remove the cartridges from the printer or go through the messy process of refilling, its all done automatically. the eqivalent cost of epson cartridges would be in the region of 500 in england, is that a saving or what?  </s>
<s> i never have to worry about the problem of epsons fault of needing to clean the heads as the ink is so cheap.  </s>
<s> look on ebay there are several suppliers advertising systems and ink at very compeditive rates  </s>
<s> when i first started using them, i didn't have much luck.  </s>
<s> however, since i started using ink sell on my old hp 970 cse, i've had absolutely no problems with their inks and they're about 50% cheaper.  </s>
<s> haven't tried them on our canon i960 yet.  </s>
<s> windex is the gentle method.  </s>
<s> if drastic method is used by the companies that recycle cartridges.  </s>
<s> they use boiling water and it will usually work.  </s>
<s> pour the boiling water into a container big and deep enough to immerse the ink jets or print head.  </s>
<s> hold it under water for several minutes until you see ink in the water.  </s>
<s> you may have to do this two or three times and you may have to squeese the cartridge.  </s>
<s> once you are getting ink out of the cartridge wipe everything dry with a paper towel and then top of the ink.  </s>
<s> to get the ink flowing in your printer print out one of these pages: if the print head is is not in the cartridge you may have to clean it separately.  </s>
<s> glenn  </s>
<s> i have been refilling my ink cartridges for four years.  </s>
<s> i used it for a couple years on an old lexmark z52 and now on a dell a960 (same manufacturer).  </s>
<s> true, useing good ink is important and good advice.  </s>
<s> i have done well with universal - color fast.  </s>
<s> a few years back i tried another brand that entered my syringe as a jell.  </s>
<s> needless to say i droped them quickly.  </s>
<s> i would suggest that if you have pretty much emptied the cartridge before refilling wick the ink through the heads as you slowly refill.  </s>
<s> this will get the ink flowing around any air bubbles that can block the inks flow.  </s>
<s> use papertowel as it wicks more slowly than toilet paper which wicks too quickly and can be dusty (paper dust).  </s>
<s> i have saved thousands in replacement cartridge costs.  </s>
<s> i replace cartridges once to twice per year, sometimes more.  </s>
<s> at one time when my work flow was greater i was refilling three to four times per month.  </s>
<s> for me, there is no better way.  </s>
<s> howard  </s>
<s> if you've got the &quot;black only&quot; option selected, the printer shouldn't be using any color ink except when you run a cleaning cycle on it.  </s>
<s> if you don't have it selected, it will always use a mix of colors to create black.  </s>
<s> technically it's not &quot;true black&quot;, but it looks like it, at least on the printers i've owned.  </s>
<s> incidentally, when you run a cleaning cycle, it uses ink (or so my epsons have always told me). where does it go?  </s>
<s> christa  </s>
<s> i have owned many, many ink jet printers, including canon (favorite), brother, epson, compaq, hp, and lexmark.  </s>
<s> i always replenish my supply with generic ink.  </s>
<s> i order from a couple of on-line sources, and the quality of the ink matches brand name.  </s>
<s> i have never had problems with the ink destroying my printers.  </s>
<s> consider, however, that not all inks are the same.  </s>
<s> once, i purchased ink from the shelves of a local discount store at an unbelievably low price. the results were unbelievable too.  </s>
<s> colored water doesn't work.  </s>
<s> i agree with most of the posted messages, generic printer ink has too much of a cost savings, ($2.50-4.00 vs $ 11.00-$12.00  </s>
<s> for cannon tanks. the cannon printers (i.e s500) that use the individual tanks, no printer nozzles.  </s>
<s> by generic i mean the ones you purchase off the web from these ink sites, which do not identify any manufacturer on the box or on the cartridge.  </s>
<s> for text and most printing purposes they are ok, colors are a little off but for everyday, at home use this is not an issue.  </s>
<s> i do believe they tend to dried up on the print-heads more often than oems but i just use a damp cotton swab or cycling through mulitple clean nozzle cycles.  </s>
<s> for pictures or any graphics that you require good to perfect results, i can not vouch for them.  </s>
<s> i know consumers reports does not recommend them for pictures, and suggested text-only if you want to use them.  </s>
<s> i've heard a lot of bad things about epsons too, both here and other places, but it hasn't stopped me from using them.  </s>
<s> i'm on my third, a cx3810 all-in-one. the second (r200) still works perfectly, but it lives at my boyfriend's house because i've been printing dvd screeners for his film.  </s>
<s> i love the way it prints on discs, they look great and printable cd / dvds are very affordable these days. the oldest one is dead.  </s>
<s> died after using non-epson cartridges.  </s>
<s> never did that again.  </s>
<s> to be fair, it could have just been that brand (and i don't remember the brand).  </s>
<s> i'm sure there are perfectly good generic inks out there, but i'm not going to try again.  </s>
<s> there was a class action settlement a while back for certain epson stylus models.  </s>
<s> apparently, a lot of cartridges for those models were reporting themselves as empty when they weren't.  </s>
<s> one of the printers was one i had, but i opted out because i never experienced the problem.  </s>
<s> i don't remember what the payout was.  </s>
<s> i think it was either a printer or a set of cartridges.  </s>
<s> about the same retail value either way.  </s>
<s> can you provide a source for ink sell inks on the web??  </s>
<s> i buy the cheapest printer that i can refill for everyday printing.  </s>
<s> about 80 percent of normal use does not require high quality printing.  </s>
<s> of course i grew up with reinking ribbons on dot matrix printers and started refilling with the first inks out there.  </s>
<s> they have really inproved over the years.  </s>
<s> i have used hp and canon printers in the past and only lately bought an epson stylus c65 for home use.  </s>
<s> i was attracted by the company &quot;bla bla&quot; concerning the new 4 cartriges (black, cyan, yellow, magenta)system that according to them will save you money being.. &quot;separate cartriges&quot;!?!?! to my surprise i realized that if one of the colour cartrige is missing or out of ink, one cannot print in the &quot;black mode&quot; at all.  </s>
<s> this is something i could do on my old hp and canon, i could infact print with the black cartrige even if the colour one was missing.  </s>
<s> we all know that printers companies make a lot more money on the sale of ink cartrages than on printers alone.  </s>
<s> unfortunately the end user is paying too much of a high price by being forced in this case to buy a colour cartridge even if he is not using it.  </s>
<s> i feel as if i have been &quot;legally&quot; ripped off!  </s>
<s> better than half of the generic ink cartridges that i have purchased for hp printers have failed to work properly.  </s>
<s> go for oem, skip the generics and avoid the hassle  </s>
<s> i was wondering if your suggestions can be applied to epson stylus c65. is there anyone out there who knows how to clean the heads and nozzles of this printer?  </s>
<s> any help will be grately appreciated.  </s>
<s> i have used ink cartridges by the original manufacturer and also tried those offered by companies that use recycled cartridges and generic ink.  </s>
<s> you are definitely less likely to have problems with a cartridge from the original manufacturer and the quality of the ink is certainly far superior.  </s>
<s> sure, the prices for the generic ink cartridges are attractive, but the quality of the ink is not nearly as good, colors are off, they dry up faster, have more problems with leaking, and often don't quite fit into the ink cartridge slots in your printer as well as the original manufacturer's cartridges do.  </s>
<s> should you have a printing problem and contact the manufacturer for support after using a generic cartridge, you will find that you have voided your warranty.  </s>
<s> so if you do want to experiment with the generics, i would strongly advise waiting to do so until a time when your printer is no longer under the manufacturer's warranty.  </s>
<s> oftentimes, even when your printer is out of warranty and you do have a problem, if you explain your problem politely and don't just go off on the customer support person who is trying to help you, they will offer you options to get repair at a discounted rate or if they determine your printer can not be repaired, they will offer you a &quot;loyalty discount&quot; to purchase a new printer at substantial savings.  </s>
<s> i learned my lesson the hard way about generic ink.  </s>
<s> yes, it is a great savings, but the problems that result are certainly not at all worth the price of the savings in the cost of ink.  </s>
<s> i now stick with the cartridges from the original manufacturer, regardless of the higher cost.  </s>
<s> you will always have more power when in need of tech support if you stick with the manufacturer's brand.  </s>
<s> and in regard to the quality of printers made today, it certainly is true that the older printers were made better and from better quality components of those made today, which are lower in quality and do break down sooner.  </s>
<s> companies want you to upgrade and had realized that the older models were outlasting their intended life expectancies and sales were slower on the newer models.  </s>
<s> so these new models, particularly the all-in-ones, do have a shorter life span so customers will be forced to buy the newer and allegedly &quot;improved&quot; models.  </s>
<s> but when you can get a &quot;loyalty discount&quot; from the manufacturer to replace a dead printer, it is worth the upgrade.  </s>
<s> i always wondered about that, so, when ink could no longer be found for my epson c-62 i went to a place that offered to fill any cartridge for $4. my printer was &quot;special&quot; so the refill did not cost substantially less. the machine stopped printing red after the first cartridge and could not be cleaned.  </s>
<s> i bought a new hp printer and i'm sticking to hp ink which i can get at a discount store for the same price the $4 guy sells it for.  </s>
<s> i believe your c65 is similar to the cx5200 that i own.  </s>
<s> because of their fine resolution the tiny jets can get dry and clog up if you don't use the printer at least once a week.  </s>
<s> i've learned the hard way.  </s>
<s> epson says using alcohol or windex will cause damage.  </s>
<s> i was ready to pitch it, then i discovered they've got the cleaning goods for specific models of epson printers.  </s>
<s> i bought a small vial of cleaning solution (they claim it's what the epson factory uses) and a syringe for under $10 - fast shipping puts it at $15. the stuff really worked!! the vial was good for dozens of applications.  </s>
<s> give it a try.  </s>
<s> i have an epson 880 it must be at least 4 years old .i have used generic inks since i bought it.  </s>
<s> it still works as well as it did then.  </s>
<s> i just bought an epson stylus photo rx620 and am using generic ink.  </s>
<s> if i get 2-3 years out of the printer i will still save money.  </s>
<s> i use a laser printer for b&w documents, and an ink jet for color documents.  </s>
<s> since i don't use much ink, i go with the expensive &quot;company brand&quot; (hp).  </s>
<s> my understanding is that laser printers have a much lower price-per-page than ink jets.  </s>
<s> after destroying my epson c80 with generic ink from a large office supplier, i would adamently say no to generic at all costs.  </s>
<s> what i do now with my hp 7650 photo printer is i use hp ink for photo's and light text and i purchased a cheap laser printer for most of my black text work.  </s>
<s> it's far more economical to do this than pay out $28 + bucks for ink every 200 pages.  </s>
<s> its like 14 cents verses less than 1 cent a page.  </s>
<s> i have been useing epson inkjet printers for seven years now.i  </s>
<s> have never bought epson ink and have never had a problem with generic.i  </s>
<s> do a lot of photo printing with very good resultes.if  </s>
<s> you don't print color very often the ink has a tendincy to dry out.  </s>
<s> these generic ink cartridges work very well with my 880 epson stylus color printer and i pay $6.40 for five cartidges of black and $11.89 for five (yes five full cartridges)of colour.  </s>
<s> staples charges $34.95 for one black cartridge the color cartridge at staples is $29.95.  </s>
<s> i also have an epson 1280 large format printer and my cartriges are $2.60 for black and $3.25 for the color cartridges.  </s>
<s> epson black cartridges retail for $30.00 and the epson color cartridges $35.00 at office depot, futureshop and at staples.  </s>
<s> i have an epson r300 photo printer that i use mainly for cd printing.  </s>
<s> i pay $37.85 for 2 sets of cartridges (1 black and 5 color) and i pay $9.99 for an additional three black cartridges.  </s>
<s> this totals $47.84.  </s>
<s> to get the same amount of ink from staples would cost $271.65.  </s>
<s> staples charges $22.41 for each black cartridge and $15.96 for each color cartridge.  </s>
<s> i buy these from an ebay store (ink123shop) they have over 10,400 feedback at 99.6% positive. the few negatives are people who claim they did not get their order or were shorted.  </s>
<s> (very doubtful claim) there were no negative feedbacks about their ink quality that i could see.  </s>
<s> they ship out of canada and shipping to me has been 4 - 7 business days.  </s>
<s> i have used close to 100 cartridges and i have never ever had any issue with their generic products.  </s>
<s> the reds are vibrant and the blacks are good and dark.  </s>
<s> inkjet printers seem to become problematic when they are not used for long periods of time.  </s>
<s> ink will dry up no matter what cartridge you use.  </s>
<s> i have been using generic printer ink for ten years.  </s>
<s> i have four epson printers, all of which run on generic ink.  </s>
<s> i cannot vouch for some of the schlock operators, but klassicspecialties.com does an outstanding job.  </s>
<s> one reservation though--lexmark or hp cartridges must be refilled, and the people who refill customarily do not evacuate the package, resulting in shorter shelf life. the epson inks look and function like new.  </s>
<s> i have two printers: brother mfc-3820cn & epson stylus photo r300 and have used compatible cartridges in both printers for over two years and have not experienced any problems with either printer because of using a compatible.  </s>
<s> i have used the same on-line company/supplier for those two years and am very happy with the service and their products; all of which i would rate excellent!  </s>
<s> their website is: and the company is located in tigard, oregon.  </s>
<s> check it out--i'm sure you will be glad you did.  </s>
<s> i've tried refills and also staples cartridges for my two hp printers.  </s>
<s> neither worked at all! the re-fill attempt was several years ago and i can't explain why it wouldn't work.  </s>
<s> (maybe hp has some super chemical sensor that detected alien ink?) with the staples ink cartridge on my 3 year old multifunction printer, the mechanism for moving the cartridge just wouldn't go.  </s>
<s> i was afraid it broke, but when i replaced the cartridge with the hp brand, it worked fine again.  </s>
<s> i have been refilling my ink cartridges for years and haven't had any problems.  </s>
<s> i have a canon photo i960 with six colored cartridges and i do a lot of photo printing.  </s>
<s> the only thing i found out is a cartridge will last about a year and then the photo's do not reproduce properly.  </s>
<s> when that happens, i buy another set of cartridges and start refilling them.  </s>
<s> i estimate it cost me about 10 cents to refill a cartridge.  </s>
<s> i've been using inkjets r us at for years now on my epson stylus 740 with no problems.  </s>
<s> i recently bought 12 cartridges for just a litte more that the price of one epson at office max.  </s>
<s> i haven't purchased a manufacturer cartridge for at least four years.  </s>
<s> i have to say that it wasn't a smooth transition and when i started refilling hp cartridges, it was always hit or miss.  </s>
<s> love their printers, didn't like refilling their cartridges.  </s>
<s> i tried canon printers(twice)and they failed mechanically within the first few months.  </s>
<s> never got a chance to try refilling.  </s>
<s> i understand that the newer models are mechanically better and easily re-fillable.  </s>
<s> i now use only epson printers.  </s>
<s> i am currently using an r220 and an r320 and went through one r200. the r220 has had only one set of original cartridges, the ones that came with it, all others have been refillable cartridges.  </s>
<s> i'm on my second set. the first set had foam in the ink supply side of the cartridge and lasted through about a year of re-filling before having problems with trapping air.  </s>
<s> they were replaced with the new foam-less cartridges and have had no problems.  </s>
<s> my r320 uses an auto re-fill system with external tanks and auto-reset chips.  </s>
<s> i never have to remove the cartridges from the printer, i just refill the external tanks.  </s>
<s> i use a good brand of bulk ink that is designed just for the epson models that i use.  </s>
<s> i have printed pictures and color graphics using the original inks and bulk inks to compare colors.  </s>
<s> there is always some difference in the colors but, not enough that anyone who was looking at one picture or the other, would say that anything was off.  </s>
<s> my reason for replying to this is: epson printers have a bad reputation of failing just after the warranty runs out.  </s>
<s> my r200 did fail just after warranty, was repaired and failed again within two months.  </s>
<s> for this reason, i don't think that i owe epson any allegence to buy their ink cartridges since i believe that their printers are designed to fail.  </s>
<s> i can refill at a fraction of the cost per cartridge $2.00 as apposed to $13.00 to $18.00 per new and i do a lot of color printing.  </s>
<s> one set of cartridges for either printer is about $85.00.  </s>
<s> i can replace the r220 printer for that price and it comes with a set of cartridges.  </s>
<s> it would make better sense to just throw the printer away and buy a new one, each time you needed to replace the cartridges.  </s>
<s> as long as i am able, i will refill my cartridges.  </s>
<s> my advise: search the internet for ink refills and re-fillable cartridges.  </s>
<s> find a site that has a good rating and dive in.  </s>
<s> once you get the hang of it, you'll never go back.  </s>
<s> oh, buy rubber gloves and keep alchohol handy for cleanup.  </s>
<s> here's not an opinion but facts... first, the cheaper the printer, generally, the more expensive the inks.  </s>
<s> secondly, some printers have lower per page costs than others, and this difference can be significant.  </s>
<s> i chose to buy a highly rated printer (mp780) from a company that tends to have the lowest per page costs (canon).  </s>
<s> because of that, each cartridge tends to cost less than $10 anyways and even the generic stuff is only $2 a cartridge cheaper at retail.  </s>
<s> but it's not like i buy more than one cartridge at a time since there are 6 separate tanks.  </s>
<s> sure i can buy the &quot;10 of every cartridge&quot; on ebay but i'm not willing to bet that after the second cartridge or so used, the remaining will be dry- it's true, inks tend to last just a year or two.  </s>
<s> i guess i don't print as many photos as the rest of you...  </s>
<s> this printer uses a pigmented ink rather than a water based ink. the cartridges work on a complex siphon system. the ink jets may not be clogged but air locked.  </s>
<s> go to: for more information or email that company with your questions.  </s>
<s> note that you also need a cartridge resetter if you refill the original cartridge.  </s>
<s> you can buy cartridges that don't need the resetter and that are easier to refill.  </s>
<s> this company has superior ink and excellent support.  </s>
<s> since printers vary so much you need specific advice.  </s>
<s> refilling cartridges is the least expensive way to go and if done correctly really does work.  </s>
<s> buying generic or recycled cartridges and work also if you shop carefully.  </s>
<s> i buy generic cartridges from lasermonks.com for their low prices and to support their mission efforts.  </s>
<s> there are other good sources so you have many to choose from.  </s>
<s> i avoid the ink refillers and bulk ink companies to send out spam.  </s>
<s> there is no way i would do business with any of them.  </s>
<s> if you need more help let me know.  </s>
<s> you can order the ink carterages from .  </s>
<s> absolutely agree with the short life from epson printers.  </s>
<s> i have had 4 r300s fail, due to faulty pc boards,in two years and told that all were uneconomical to repair.  </s>
<s> epson were polite but absolutely useless at coming up with any repacement help.  </s>
<s> as for paying the ridiculious price of their cartridges when i obtain the same results for a tenth of their price, they must think we were born yesterday.  </s>
<s> stick to tank feed systems which have no sponge in the cartridges.  </s>
<s> first of all, epsons do break down after heavy use.  </s>
<s> secondly, with the money you save on generic ink, you can buy a newer, more advanced printer.  </s>
<s> i have never in five epsons had a problem with klassicspecialties.com.  </s>
<s> epson must love your buddy.  </s>
<s> printing in colour produces blank pages (actually i can sometimes get a bit of pale blue).  </s>
<s> even when i have black only selected in the printer control it will not print unless i have three colour cartridges.  </s>
<s> nothing comes out of them apparently but then the printer decides the ink has run out and i need to buy new ones.  </s>
<s> i have used ink kits for ink refills for lexmark cartridges with very good results, provided i print out every day a test page or other material.  </s>
<s> i am now using a kit called iprint with no problems (i have used up all the ink in the kit in some 3 or 4 refills) so long as i follow the rule of a printout everyday.  </s>
<s> i used, in the distant past, a kit called universal inkjet refill system. the results with it were equal to or better than the iprint kit.  </s>
<s> a refill kit consisting of plastic bellows with attached needle filled with ink from wal-mart was a disaster.  </s>
<s> the iprint i found at target; the universal kit was some time ago advertised by cvs at something like $10 for three 25 ml bottles of ink.  </s>
<s> included was a syringe, bottle of solvent, and instructions.  </s>
<s> the iprint kit is essentially the same as the universal kit.  </s>
<s> i have also tried the technique of pulling out the cartridge and setting it on a wet paper towel to get the ink flowing after a time of no use.  </s>
<s> this works very well.  </s>
<s> however, after several removals and replacements of the cartidge a ridge locking the cartridge in place broke off and the cartridge would no longer lock in place.  </s>
<s> under those conditions a replacement cartridge was needed.  </s>
<s> i have used a tool which i made consisting of a strip of metal about three-quarters-inch wide with a layer of felt cemented to it.  </s>
<s> this tool i use to soak the bottom of the cartridge while in place without removal. the lexmark cartridge can be parked in place at the center-front of the carriage permitting the water-soaked felt strip to be slipped under; a minute or less of soaking is generally enough to get the ink flowing.  </s>
<s> this also worked well.  </s>
<s> i have used a remanufactured cartridge in one case and gotten satisfactory results.  </s>
<s> there will always be one that will not perform well, or will leak ink, or show other problems.  </s>
<s> in the one case, the first cartridge did not work and the supplier replaced it without charge.  </s>
<s> remanufactured cartridges save only little in cost and it is a turkey shoot to get a satisfactory replacement.  </s>
<s> in my view, the difference in cost between a new cartridge, a remanufacture cartridge, and a refill system is totally in favor of the refill and i intend to go looking for a universal kit shortly.  </s>
<s> good luck, sick of bush  </s>
<s> it's a very good question.  </s>
<s> i have just purchased a top of the range canon all-in-one printer and the integrated software will not allow me to use generic inks.  </s>
<s> it will also record any instances of me doing so and void any warranty.  </s>
<s> canon tell me that generic inks are inferior and can damage the print head.  </s>
<s> i am not prepared to risk it because the printer is very pricey.  </s>
<s> if, however you have a cheaper printer, i would certainly take the risk as the money saved over time would more than compensate if the printer ultimately needed replacing.  </s>
<s> do you use a specific generic epson ink or just any one that you see?  </s>
<s> i've found the very cheap inks have a tendency for the cartridges to run dry - either that or they don't actually contain much ink.  </s>
<s> (yes easily 5x cheaper than epson originals).  </s>
<s> more expensive cartridges do much better and are fine for day to day work.  </s>
<s> but for high quality output on quality papers and for true colour reproduction you really need the manufacturer's own cartridges.  </s>
<s> my problems with past epson printers has been with nozzles clogging.  </s>
<s> this always seemed to happen more frequently with third party inks and i found i used half my ink doing head cleaning cycles.  </s>
<s> however i only use my home printer every now and then.  </s>
<s> the danger is that if one or more nozzles are starved of ink during printing then they can over heat and burn out - the flow of ink acts as a lubricant and coolant to the nozzles.  </s>
<s> if this happens then your printer is useless and no amount of cleaning will fix it.  </s>
<s> anyway after several broken epson printers over the years i've now bought an hp printer - that way you get a new print head with every new cartridge.  </s>
<s> i have an epson color 880 for four years.  </s>
<s> i use nothing but generic ink and i have never had a problem.  </s>
<s> occasionally, i print family photos as large as 8 x 10, with very good results.  </s>
<s> i have been refilling ink cartridges for years in my hp printer.  </s>
<s> i had no poblems filling them myself.  </s>
<s> i would refill original hp cartridges 3 times and then buy a fresh oem cartridge, refill that 3 times and so on. the one time that i use a refurbished cartridge from staples, the cartridge leaked and ruined my printer.  </s>
<s> luckily, the printer was old anyway so it wasn't a loss.  </s>
<s> thew problem with refurbished cartridges is that you don't know how many times it has beed refilled.  </s>
<s> that was a heck of a testimonial, and their feedback rating can't be beat.  </s>
<s> i'm gonna try them out.  </s>
<s> with the money i'd save on one set of cartridges, i can afford to buy another printer if it doesn't work out.  </s>
<s> not saying it won't work out, mind you.  </s>
<s> just needed that last bit of reasoning to talk myself into it.  </s>
<s> christa  </s>
<s> i had never heard of them until now.  </s>
<s> thanks for the heads up - they have toner carts for my okipage 6e! my little old slow-as-all-get-out 6e. i use it to print plain text pages (my scripts and research articles mostly).  </s>
<s> it still works great - as long as i'm not in a hurry.  </s>
<s> i've refilled the cart that's in it about 10 times.  </s>
<s> (spread out lots of newspaper, don't wear good clothes, etc.)it's time for a new cart and maybe a new drum.  </s>
<s> it's seen a lot of use.  </s>
<s> ah, they don't make 'em like they used to.  </s>
<s> iv'e been using a canon i865 for several years now, started of with canon inks at $26aust after 12 months changed to generic at $8aust never had a problem and the same quallity.  </s>
<s> i do stay with using quality paper though.  </s>
<s> willy, i'm very interested in the types of repairs you have effected on epson printers.  </s>
<s> i am currently wrestling with an epson c80 stylus, for a buddy of mine (i enjoy the challenge of trying to help others, and am generally successful, although not bashful about asking for advice/help from others when i'm stumped).  </s>
<s> after returning from a three week trip, my friend could not get this epson to print.  </s>
<s> he purchased, and installed, replacement recycled cartridges from office depot.  </s>
<s> still would not print, even though the ink monitor indicated plenty of ink in each of the cartridges.  </s>
<s> i suspected dried nozzles.  </s>
<s> i've gone through the ''nozzle clean'' cycles more times than i care to count.  </s>
<s> printing the pattern started to show a little of the pattern but never more than that. is there a manual method of cleaning the nozzles?  </s>
<s> i must confess, i haven't been able to determine the ink path from the cartridge (tank) to the paper.  </s>
<s> would greatly appreciate any guidance you can offer.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> pete  </s>
<s> i'm fishing for as much help as i can get.  </s>
<s> your description for unclogging sounds extremely useful.  </s>
<s> could you please explain the distinction you make between ''inkjets'' and ''print heads''.  </s>
<s> i'm dealing with an epson stylus c80 and epson stylus c82.  </s>
<s> thanks for any assistance you can provide.  </s>
<s> pete edman  </s>
<s> i have had a problem where i let one color go too far down, and the nozzle clogged.  </s>
<s> there is no quick fix.  </s>
<s> i generally, after running the nozzle cleaning utility several times, until i see a faint print pattern.  </s>
<s> leave it set over night, and the nozzle(s) seem to clear.  </s>
<s> your printer uses cartridges very much like the cartridges on my epson stylus photo r220.  </s>
<s> they work on a siphon principle.  </s>
<s> the inkjets are in the box that holds the cartridges.  </s>
<s> in other words the ink is feed from the cartridge to the ink jets. the oem cartridges are designed to be used only one time, but you can refill them and use a device called a &quot;resetter&quot; which fools the printer into &quot;thinking&quot; you have a new cartridge.  </s>
<s> you can buy replacemeent cartridges that auto reset with each use and are easier to refill.  </s>
<s> in fact i filled a set of those cartridges today and made some beautiful color prints and some nice cd labels (the r220 can print right on a printable white cd or dvd).  </s>
<s> i suggest you contact the folks at the printer filling station by email.  </s>
<s> they can tell you just what you need to do and what supplies you need to buy to get started refilling the cartridges.  </s>
<s> btw the empty replacement cartridges are worth the money.  </s>
<s> you don't need the resetter to use these cartridges and you can fill them while the cartridge is in the printer.  </s>
<s> very neat!  </s>
<s> my canon bjc 3000 won't last much longer but it still works fine for doing a few sheets at a time.  </s>
<s> i was ready to toss it and these folks told me about the taking out the box and cleaning it with a hot water bath.  </s>
<s> i also have a hp deskjet 3820 that i hate. the ink drys out unless i use it at least once every two or three days.  </s>
<s> the color cartridge has all three colors in one cartridge.  </s>
<s> i can refill it, but i mainly limit this printer to use in printing checks using the versa magnetic black ink, but that's another story.  </s>
<s> you can email the printing filling staion at: mailto:passone@bellsouth.net or via their web sit at: glenn h.  </s>
<s> i've had good and bad experience with refill ink.  </s>
<s> good ink i have used is from 123refills.com and also from sameink.com - good comprehensive refill instructions and also they have tech support by email if you need it.  </s>
<s> i have not used it on an epson printer as i don't own one!  </s>
<s> but i have used it on my cannon pixma 3000 and also on my hp all in one unit.  </s>
<s> they both worked great for regular printing.  </s>
<s> sameink inks worked best on my cannon for picture printing.  </s>
<s> the bad ink i purchased was from filljet.com - not that it did not work, but the colors were not as bright. the black was almost gray!  </s>
<s> they both have good inks, and good c/s and suport for their product.  </s>
<s> wha do you mean by wick the ink through the heads ?  </s>
<s> is this needed to be done for a cannon printer?  </s>
<s> bob.  </s>
<s> if you are getting real cleaning problems i would suggest that you purchase a set of cleaning cartridges, available from 7dayshop.com; they contain only cleaning fluid.  </s>
<s> i have found that if the nozzles will not give a good nozzle print after three goes ( colour cartridges installed), stop and leave the printer over night, they clear themselves 99% of the time.  </s>
<s> once again go for a feed system cheaper than refill cartridges and no mess and no sponge in the tanks.  </s>
<s> there are fancy cleaning ink carts you buy from ink refill sources, but again, heres' what i do.  </s>
<s> get your hands on paper shop towels(like mechanics use) or clean cloth like an old t-shirt.  </s>
<s> cut or tear into a small swatch, soak in warm water, wring out, but leave damp.  </s>
<s> place under nozzle parking station where the ink carts rest. the damp swatch is between the ink cart nozzle face and the parking cap.  </s>
<s> use the wide printing gap for envelope to increase distance and allow swatch to rest there.  </s>
<s> now, allow the swatch overnight and test in the morning, repeat until successful.  </s>
<s> since this is long process and uses ink, yada, yada, it really is a last resort for the user.  </s>
<s> in no way allow a inkjet printer to be left unused too long as &quot;drying/clogging&quot; occurs and in epson's a pita.  </s>
<s> unlike other inkjet vendors, you can replace the ink carts since the nozzles are part of it, you usually correct the problem, not so with epson.  </s>
<s> canon too has the problem but at least you can buy the nozzle assembly and far easier than epson to repair.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> if finding an icc is a problem, you can make your own for an epson, better than this is to puchase one from pureprofiles at around 20. i have done this and the difference is amazing.  </s>
<s> this is a very good, helpful company and is well worth the outlay.  </s>
<s> some companies charge 10 times this for a profile.  </s>
<s> incidently i have no interest connection with this company  </s>
<s> wait till you own a dell printer.  </s>
<s> you have a limited resource, it's made by lexmark but dell has the rights to only dell ink cartridges.  </s>
<s> i did see a lexmark adapter for a dell printer but none of my friends will take a chance to see if it works.  </s>
<s> i too have come across fairly new printers with after market ink cart.  </s>
<s> and boy did it make a mess.  </s>
<s> to me it was'nt worth cleaning, the sopping pad was over filled and the ink was all over top to bottom with ink.  </s>
<s> walgreens advertise refills @ half cost but i do'nt know of any of my friends have tried it.  </s>
<s> test it and let us know.  </s>
<s> thanks ron  </s>
<s> i have 3 epson printers and use generic ink in the one that i don't print photos with.  </s>
<s> i've never had a problem and it's 1/3 the cost of the regular cartridges from epson.  </s>
<s> i'm not aware of any hardware problems from the ink., is there something specific that you know of that your friend had happen?  </s>
<s> it does depend on what you are printing, too, as far as longer term quality retention.  </s>
<s> i have had this happen.  </s>
<s> i never knew if it was because they are generic or if the epson ones do the same.  </s>
<s> but if it has even been just a couple of days i may get terrible color output and once in awhile black,too.  </s>
<s> but i've had that happen with the epson cartridges, too.  </s>
<s> could you please explain what a feed system is?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> to all who responded to my inquiries, please accept my sincerest gratitude for your very timely, prompt, instructive information.  </s>
<s> i have made a composite of all the input you provided and will make good use of all i've learned from you.  </s>
<s> again, many thanks.  </s>
<s> pete edman  </s>
<s> i have an epson printer and use generic cartidges that are 1/2-1/3 the price of oem.  </s>
<s> i have never had a problem with this method.  </s>
<s> i had a previous stylus that was ruined by trying to do refills.  </s>
<s> i strongly advise against.  </s>
<s> it is not worth ruining the printer head; which means you might as well get a new printer.  </s>
<s> i have a one year old canon pixma 850.  </s>
<s> i love it.  </s>
<s> i only buy generic, both the photo and regular inks.  </s>
<s> i order online (from xxx injets.com).  </s>
<s> shipping is free and no tax.  </s>
<s> since i do very little color printing and the black gets used a lot, i buy 12 30ml.  </s>
<s> cartidges for every one color or black for photo.  </s>
<s> although printing with color(maps, etc.) is prety, i never do it.  </s>
<s> what a waste.  </s>
<s> i can remove and replace the color cartridges at will.  </s>
<s> can't do that with the hp and lexmark rip-off machines!  </s>
<s> btw, if you believe that your cartridge has dried out rather than being empty, here's a fix.  </s>
<s> put a small amount of windex in a shallow saucer and set the catridge in it for a short while. the spongy material will absorb it and dissolve the dried out ink.  </s>
<s> i used an epson 777 for about three years.  </s>
<s> worked very well in the beginning but with time the print-jets seemed to work less reliable.  </s>
<s> i would spend endless times and lots of expensive ink to run cleaning-cycles, ever less successfully.  </s>
<s> print quality was getting very bad. because of high cost of epson cartridges used up just in cleaning-cycles tried &quot;generic ink&quot; and cleaning-solutions.  </s>
<s> not any better.  </s>
<s> a fry offer of refurbished canon i550 for $ 50 looked great as a replacement: the cartridges in the printer were worth more than the total cost!  </s>
<s> two other good points: the print-nozzles are on a separate frame and can be bought ~$ 50. also, the bci-3e cartridges are only ~1/2 foam and the rest are fluid-reservoir --- allowing more ink to be put into the cartridge.  </s>
<s> refill signal works well: reservoir is really empty when warning comes up.  </s>
<s> have used ims-ink bought at costco for $ 17, with 240 ml black, 80 ml each cyan, magenta, yellow, photo-cyan, photo-magenta.  </s>
<s> did 24 refills by now of the black cartridge delivered with printer, 8 refills each with the three original color-cartridges.  </s>
<s> almost used up one refill kit over three years!  </s>
<s> no problems, no cleaning cycles ever done.  </s>
<s> seems to be a good combination for me!  </s>
<s> the feed system consists of a bank of 6 external tanks (this is for a r300 epson)with a set of tubes going to a bank of six special cartridges installed in the printer.  </s>
<s> these tubes are a permanent fixture and and designed to travel with the printer cartridges while printing.  </s>
<s> this is all supplied as a kit, cost approx 35.  </s>
<s> each external tank holds 100ml of i.e. equvilent to six cartridges.  </s>
<s> when the cartridge in the printer reaches approx 10% ink level the system automatically resets the chip to full.  </s>
<s> all you ever have to do is top up the external tanks which merely involves opening the tank and literally pouring the ink from a bottle, no removal of anything and absolutely no mess.  </s>
<s> ink can be bought for between 15 and 25 from ebay sites, this is for 6 x 100ml bottles, which is equivelent to 60 yes 60 cartridges.  </s>
<s> when a system as cheap as this is available i am bemused as to why so many of these replies are about refilling cartrides.  </s>
<s> throw away the cartridges and invest in a feed system, type in ''ink feed systems'' on the internet search, there are lots of sites in america.  </s>
<s> i have been using this system for 2 years and i get through a normal set of cartridges in 2 to 3 weeks, my outlay for ink over this period has been 40 the equivelent epson cartridges would be in the region of 1500, whats that about $2300!!!  </s>
<s> do you know if this feed system is also on the epson r320?  </s>
<s> kt  </s>
<s> i have an epson r220 and a r320. the same auto refill system will fit the r200, r220, r300, r320 and r340.  </s>
<s> they all take the same cartridges.  </s>
<s> follow the directions closly on installation, it can be tricky but worth the work.  </s>
<s> i use re-fillable cartridges in my r220 and a auto fill system in my r320.  </s>
<s> when the re-fillable cartridges in my r220 reach the end of their life, (yes everything has an end) i will replace them with an auto refill system.  </s>
<s> once you get set up and running, you'll never think about going back to cartridges.  </s>
<s> (manufacturer, or aftermarket)  </s>
<s> yes, cheaper printer = higher ink cost.  </s>
<s> it's not all that obvious at first, because you can't always tell by the price of the cartridges - you have to consider how much ink is actually in the cartridges!  </s>
<s> i may be old & fat, but i think i can still run fast enough to get away from someone trying to give me another lexmark.  </s>
<s> i have a really cheap lexmark that i actually like, but no longer use it because i can't afford to keep ink in it!  </s>
<s> had another lexmark all-in-one that i gave away brand new in the box - i got it free with a computer i bought (used the same ink cartridges!) i have an epson 1280 i paid around $400 for.  </s>
<s> besides the fact that the ink cartridges seem to last much longer (must have had 3-4 times as much ink as the lexmarks), i now have it outfitted with a cfs (continous flow system - referred to in earlier post as a &quot;feed system&quot; aka bulk feed system.  </s>
<s> i chose that particular printer because i needed a wide printer and i wanted one that i could get a cfs for.  </s>
<s> i haven't found anyone who makes a cfs for lexmark. the lexmark cartridges were difficult to refill (compared to previous experience with refilling hp, canon, & even epson cartridges) and then most didn't work even with a chip resetter!  </s>
<s> while not all generic inks are created equal, it really depends mostly on what kind of printing you do.  </s>
<s> if mostly text & 2d artwork, generic is probably ok. i have had experience with some generic ink colors looking muddy or dull on photo prints.  </s>
<s> on the store branded generics (ie staples, officemax, etc.) i don't see a big enough difference in the cost for the loss of quality for photo printer (paper quality also makes a big difference for photos.) i also tried some ink that was very cheap i got online, but had to order 4 cartridges to make shipping charges worthwhile - well i have 3 unopened, collecting dust on the boxes and took the first one out and put it in trash while it still had plenty of ink.  </s>
<s> i could not accept the poor quality for my purposes (mostly photos & t-shirt transfers).  </s>
<s> when used for t-shirt transfers, even with professional quality transfer paper & professional heat press, the colors from the cheaper ink ran when washed. the ink i'm using now is not oem, but i wouldn't call it generic or even cheap (although it does save me more $ than the cheap cartridges).  </s>
<s> i bought a cfs (continous flow system) for my epson that i am extremely pleased with!  </s>
<s> there are many companies to choose from for epson printers & even some canons.  </s>
<s> i did a lot of research before investing - some systems said you could only use their inks, and others had very complicated installation instructions.  </s>
<s> i finally chose a system from .  </s>
<s> their system was supposed to work with most any bulk inks, but they had several kinds to choose from depending on your needs.  </s>
<s> i chose the archival inks for t-shirt transfers (and they also sell a very good transfer paper actually cheaper than our previous supplier).  </s>
<s> their archival ink produces better results than the original epson branded inks.  </s>
<s> you have to spend a little more upfront for the system, but i've already done enough printing that i would have already spent more on individual cartidges than what the system & ink cost and i had even bought an extra refill set because i wasn't sure how much printing i could do before refilling.  </s>
<s> the lowest bottle of ink is still over half full!  </s>
<s> also, when i need more, i can order just the color i need - not all six.  </s>
<s> also, the bottles sit outside the printer and you can actually see how much ink is in them.  </s>
<s> i am thrilled with this set-up.  </s>
<s> it will cost a little more to get started if you have a lexmark printer, because you'll have to trash the lexmark & buy epson or canon (but check which models you can get cfs for before you buy).  </s>
<s> also known as bulk ink system.  </s>
<s> see my other post on upper level of this thread or there are many other suppliers of these systems, the one referenced was my personal choice.  </s>
<s> this is most detailed instructions i've found online: plus, this one is not trying to sell a specific cleaning kit.  </s>
<s> i use generic ink, and my epson quit working under warranty.  </s>
<s> epson fixed it.  </s>
<s> let's face it, the 5x cost of ink makes the purchase of a new printer a viable option.  </s>
<s> but maybe you like being gouged.  </s>
<s> the everest system i have looks a lot tidier set up than the ones from your recommended supplier and costs far less i.e. 42 (70ish dollars) filled with dye base and 67 (100ish dollars) with pigment ink. the system has worked perfectly for two years, type 6739728711 on ebay search which will take you direst to the site  </s>

<s> than any ink jet you can find.  </s>
<s> it does not waste ink to clean nozzles every time you turn it on, it does not dry out if you don't use it for days, etc.. since it uses powder.  </s>
<s> and if you decide to get an ink jet anyway, beware of epson!! epson's scheming to suck your money went beyond any other company it seems.  </s>
<s> if you run out of ink in any cartridge the printer refuses to print at all!! even if you just want to print a short note, and don't mind to use blue instead of black.  </s>
<s> no, they know better what you need! run to a store for a new cartridge, or take a valium.  </s>
<s> if you use printer only occasionally, you will find out that all your ink is gone quickly anyways, just to clean those nozzles.  </s>
<s> in fact, there is still quite a bit ink left in the cartridge, but you need special hardware gadget to unlock a build in chip, which prevents you from using it.  </s>
<s> and nowadays, you can also find reasonably priced color laser printers.  </s>
<s> go laser  </s>
<s> i opted in to the suit since my r200 has semi-frequent issues with &quot;false empty&quot; reporting; far from receiving a new printer or the equivalent in cartridges, my choices for compensation were either: 1) a 45$ credit to order cartridges from epson's e-store or a 25$ cheque and 20$ e-store credit, or b) a 25% discount off epson e-store purchases for a total discount of up to 100$.  </s>

<s> the over night trick to clear the nozzle usually works for me.  </s>
<s> another trick is, if one nozzle in blocked, is to print a word document that has a lot of print on it, but change the colour of the print to the same as the blocked nozzle and print on the plain paper setting but change the type of paper to photo/best photo setting, doing this makes the printer deposit far more ink that in the text setting thus acting as a cleaning cycle.  </s>
