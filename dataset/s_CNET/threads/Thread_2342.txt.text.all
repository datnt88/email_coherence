<s> i just purchased a laptop for home use only with an integrated wireless card (g standard).  </s>
<s> what i want is real simple but achieving it is very confusing...i have a broadband internet connection via a cable modem.  </s>
<s> i want a hard-wired connection to the internet in my office (in the basement) but also want the freedom to surf the internet when i'm upstairs or on my deck outside.  </s>
<s> what components do i need?  </s>
<s> based on my research it appears all i need is a router, correct?  </s>
<s> any recommended routers with good range and a strong signal...and easy to setup for newbies like myself?  </s>
<s> i have on order a 75 buck wifi-g combo pack from dlink.  </s>
<s> i'll have a spare part, but the wifi-g router is what you want.  </s>
<s> outside of oddball names.  </s>
<s> linksys, netgear and dlink seem all the same to me now as to ease of setup.  </s>
<s> and range is limited by fcc regulations... bob  </s>
<s> contrary to popular belief, and the advice you hear from others here, don't go wireless!! do you want others using your internet connection to surf porn sites?  </s>
<s> maybe even illegal ones, and show your ip as where it is coming from?  </s>
<s> then stay away from wireless.  </s>
<s> do you hear of companies switching from wired to wireless networks?  </s>
<s> there'a a reason they don't.  </s>
<s> at this point, there is no secure wireless connections.  </s>
<s> even encryption won't be enough to keep out a hacker.  </s>
<s> get a router, some cat5 cabling, and install rj45 connections where you want to connect at.  </s>
<s> wireless is not secure.  </s>
<s> period.  </s>
<s> i don't care who you buy the wireless router from, how many &quot;security&quot; features it has, or anything else.  </s>
<s> don't go wifi and convince yourself you have a safe connection.  </s>
<s> btw, i am a certified tech (a+, n+, windows 2000 professional, and windows 2000 advanced server) with a college degree in computer science.  </s>
