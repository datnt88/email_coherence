does anyone know how to replace the dvd-drive in the original xbox with a pc dvd-drive, because the xbox dvd-drive is only 5x, which results in slow loading times for me. i want something like a 16x drive so i don't have to wait that long.... also, does anyone know if i can also replace the internal xbox hard drive with a pc hard drive, cause i want to rip some games onto the hard drive..... if anyone can give me a feedback, i'll deeply appreciate it.....
sorry, but that is not a feature of this device. as to replacing the drive, i see such offers on google.com try doing a little research. bob
for those who have modded or tinkered the xbox before, can you tell me all the things that are possible to do with the original xbox??? any experiences and ideas are gladly welcomed....
cnet did this.
can you tell me the link or the page of this???
as its huge and only provides 10gb of space.
sorry, but this thread is now locked. please review the forum policies to see where it went over the line.
