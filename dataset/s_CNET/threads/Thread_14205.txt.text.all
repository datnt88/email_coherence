<s> and now the sound is somewhat corrupted.  </s>
<s> i mean that every minute or so music or dvds or whatever seems to be warbled.  </s>
<s> i'm able to access the internet without a problem and i don't think that installing this hardware has interfered with the irq channels since sound is controlled by the mobo.  </s>
<s> problem is, the drivers that came with the desktop adaptor were not xp verified.  </s>
<s> so if anyone could please tell me how to troubleshoot this, i'd be grateful.  </s>
<s> see  </s>
<s> i just got the same card, and its doing the same thing.  </s>
<s> studdering occationally, as if my system is doing hard work, when really its just idle.  </s>
<s> i can tell something is happening because any audio playing will studder as if slowing down momentarily, as well as mouse speed studdering.  </s>
<s> i'm certain it has nothing to do with drm as suggested above, as it affects entire system, its just more noticable with audio playing (including game audio).  </s>
<s> i read people having problems with the drivers ( ), and that &quot;the chipset is made by atheros, which also is in the wpm7000 by linksys&quot; (from post in link above), but i can't seem to find the drivers for a wpm7000 by linksys, if it even exsists.  </s>
<s> this is really a pain in the ass.  </s>
<s> uninstalling the card gets rid of the problem, and it comes back when i reinstall it.  </s>
<s> its also auto starting the d-link wireless connection manager twice, so that two green bars appear in my notification area.  </s>
<s> i had a netgear wpn 311 who's drivers kept crashing to blue screen randomly, which is why i thought i was &quot;upgrading&quot; to this d-link card and router.  </s>
<s> so im not having the best of luck with wireless.  </s>
<s> i figured out that the linksys drivers reffered are these : ( ) the eu and au version of the linksys card chipset is made by atheros, like the d-link cards.  </s>
<s> i tried this driver, and, while the card appears as wmp300n - wireless-n pci adapter, it works, but still studders the same way (audio still studders).  </s>
<s> the studdering is making the mouse hard to controll too which is the biggest pain in the ass, cause i gotta photoshop for work.  </s>
<s> it's a simple procedure that i've used a few hundred times to cure this.  </s>
<s> it's so simple that i do that first before doing anything else.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i tried the linksys driver, it didn't work, the internet connection sucked i got the updated driver from dlink [1.02 i think] and now i have a great connection, but i have the stutters anyone?  </s>
<s> forgive my ignorance, but what does switching the dma of my ide harddrive or cdrom help this issue with a driver for a network adapter card?  </s>
<s> or am i doing something wrong?  </s>
<s> i must decline writing the long answer for each member.  </s>
<s> it's a quick, painless, no reboot procedure and we use that first to dismiss the usual.  </s>
<s> if this is unacceptable then please research it further or just take it to a repair counter.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply, bob from what i can tell, both my primary and secondary are in dma mode.  </s>
<s> i still seem to having the audio/video stutter issue thanks again for the reply i guess i will have to do more research  </s>
<s> we have to flip it to pio and back in a specific manner since we can't tell if it's in dma 0 or 5 or 6. if you decline the procedure i'd rather not explore all the other areas first.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i will do that now and i will let you know thanks!  </s>
<s> my primary channel devices 0 and 1 are both dma mode 5 my secondary channel device 0 is mode 2 and device 1 is n/a  </s>
<s> i'm unsure if you are posting in the right place.  </s>
<s> also i can't find all the details asked for when you post.  </s>
<s> i suggest a new post in the right forum and here's the forum note: note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.  </s>
