<s> i need help choosing a photo scanner that can handle black & white negatives, black and white prints, color negatives, color prints and color transparencies-- all with good quality results-- and transmit them directly to my pc for editing and storage.  </s>
<s> i use picasa now.  </s>
<s> i also have available irfanview and microsoft digital image suite 10. i've never owned a scanner, but i've heard that i'm not asking too much of a single unit.  </s>
<s> if the same machine can also be used as a printer, so much the better but that isn't essential.  </s>
<s> there are several on the market that have the capability to do what you want to do.  </s>
<s> hewlett packard makes several different models.  </s>
<s> epson makes a nice one also, it is called the perfection and works well.  </s>
<s> there are several units that do it all, printing, scanning(slides and transparencies) and copying.  </s>
<s> check out your local box stores and see what they might have.  </s>
<s> they are not that expensive probably between 200 and 300 bucks should get you there.  </s>
<s> good luck!  </s>
<s> thanks, phil.  </s>
<s> that will get me going.  </s>
<s> btw, what's your personal experience with the scanners you mentioned?  </s>
<s> ztiw  </s>
<s> epson perfection years ago included cleanup software.  </s>
<s> example at your &quot;spec&quot; is a little odd.  </s>
<s> can you explain &quot;transmit them directly to my pc for editing and storage&quot;?  </s>
<s> some thought about a scanner that you hovered over tapping some copy button and never touching the pc. bob  </s>
