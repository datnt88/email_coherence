i just bought a new notebook computer (cf. specs below). will i notice significant performance increase if i add 512mb for a total 1gb ram? also, will the extra ram significantly decrease battery life? toshiba satellite m55-s325 intel centrino m 740 [1.73ghz, 2mb l2 cache, 533mhz fsb] mobile intel 915gm express chipset 512mb on-board with 1 slot for 512mb or 1024mb pc2700 ddr 333mhz sdram
yes. don't go past a gig. beyond that is overkill. battery life? adding devices will add drain to the battery. how much? probably negligable. wayne loud pipes, long necks, and loose women. nowhar but texas! click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software.
it's my experience that with xp, you won't see any significant difference with anything more than 512mb. the reason is simply that most apps. don't require that much ram. some of the new 64 bit technology may be able to use more ram, but for a 32 bit system, 512 mb should handle the load with ease.
thank you all of your discussion about ram. my machine is a notebook with intel pentium m 730 processor (2 mb l2 cache, 1.6 ghz, 533 mhz fsb) centrino, 512mb ddr. i was thinking to upgrade ram but now i think i do not need to upgrade. your discussion helps me to take a right decision to upgrade ram or not to upgrade. thank you again.
