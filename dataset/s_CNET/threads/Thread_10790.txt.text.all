<s> a bit of help would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> recently bought a sony laptop (fs series) with an lcd screen, which was absolutely beautiful.  </s>
<s> after having it for a about a month, i suddely got two dead perfect circles (about an inch to an inch and a half each).  </s>
<s> sony, after a month of hell trying to get warrantee service, tells me that the laptop is not covered under warrantee because it's physical damage.  </s>
<s> i find this impossible to believe, as i treated this laptop like an egg -- extrememly carefully.  </s>
<s> never dropped it, never abused it, hadn't even travelled with it and the few times i took it from one location to the next, it was in my laptop bag.  </s>
<s> that and the fact that there are two distinct areas (which are growing) and no other signs of physical damage (no cracks, scuffs or anything else like that).  </s>
<s> my questions: if this was indeed damage caused, is it possible to suddenly have two distinct perfect circles? is there a manufacturing defect which could cause this (pinholes in the screen or something)?  </s>
<s> basically, is there anything besides the unit being struck that could explain this phenomenon and if it was caused by being struck, how could it cause those two distinct spots?  </s>
<s> unfortunately, sony has decided that this can only be caused by some sort of trauma to the unit so i don't expect much help from them, but any ideas from this forum would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> that's the short version.  </s>
<s> circles would certainly look like physical damage... you can't fix a labtop display anyway, so unless they can be convinced to give you a new one, there's nothing to be done.  </s>
<s> and what's with the &quot;children?&quot;  </s>
<s> you would have to read their other post where they traveled with the laptop in a backpack.  </s>
<s> you may have seen children kick luggage, backpacks, sit on such and if you read all the words you see an opportunity for something to have happened to the failed laptop without the owner's knowledge.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> don't you have to hit the display while the laptop is open to make circles?  </s>
<s> the usual laptop case doesn't protect the lcd very well.  </s>
<s> but wouldn't a kick or a strike make for one circle, crack, scuff or whatever?  </s>
<s> unless it was hit twice, why would there suddenly be two distinct circles?  </s>
<s> i don't mean to keep flogging a dead horse, but this laptop was brand-new and i treated it like a newborn -- i find it really hard to believe that it received any sort of shock whatsoever, especially one that could have damaged it while closed and in the case.  </s>
<s> had i knocked it around, checked it as baggaage or left it unattended, i could accept that it was damaged -- what leads me to believe it's defective instead of damaged is the very care i gave it. is there really no other possible cause for these circles? is it possible that a sony laptop is that fragile?  </s>
<s> lcds are very fragile.  </s>
<s> some don't realise just how fragile.  </s>
<s> since i can't see the spots, and i've seen far too many dead or damaged lcds, the lcd that didn't die from some trauma is something very rare.  </s>
<s> i'd call it in and just say you are not happy with the unit and want out.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hey bob thanks for taking the time with this thread, i very much appreciate it.  </s>
<s> will try (again) with sony, but given it's taken a month just to get this answer, i'm running out of hope.  </s>
<s> any more ideas would be of great help.  </s>
<s> well, it's a few months later and the screen has all but healed itself.  </s>
<s> the larger (and remaining) of the two dots has recently disappeared, after growing and shrinking for a few weeks, so the only fault left with the screen is a small bit on the extreme upper right corner.  </s>
<s> still not happy with having to wait over a month, uncounted calls and more than a few hours on hold, being transferred, etc. with sony's customer 'service' team, but at least my screen is almost back to it's beautiful self, and without having to pay the extortionate can $1,700+ they wanted to replace it.  </s>
<s> am still too afraid to travel with this thing given how fragile it turned out to be, but at least now i have a beautiful desktop, albeit in laptop form.  </s>
<s> thanks to those who offered their insights.  </s>
<s> hope my problem and 'solution' is of help to others.  </s>
<s> aaaaaaand it's back.  </s>
<s> my big black spot that went away all by itself is now, for no apparent reason, back.  </s>
<s> as bored as many of you must be getting with these posts, imagine how i must feel -- i own the thing!  </s>
<s> if notebooks can't be ported without damage, how can they be called portable?  </s>
<s> why is it that a company can sell a product and then when it doesn't stand up to the use for which it was designed and sold, simply assume that it must have been abused and therefore refuse service?  </s>
<s> if the wheels fell of my car, could nissan say i must have been driving too agressively, otherwise why would the wheels have fallen off?  </s>
<s> if i sound bitter and frustrated with sony it's only because they sold me a substandard product and then refuse to stand behind it.  </s>
<s> i'll know for next time.  </s>
