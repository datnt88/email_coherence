<s> you could try it with the existing but at some point suspect you'll have to replace.  </s>
<s> if the budget permits...i'd replace now while you're doing the gpu.  </s>
<s> re replacement options...i wouldn't consider either of those you've listed.  </s>
<s> i would however recommend something with a better warranty, longer mtbf, better buyer ratings, greater efficiency (uses less electricity), better tech site reviews like the one below.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>

<s> right now i just have enough for the 5770 at 154.99 and 30 to 45 for the psu.  </s>
<s> so if there is another one at that price range let me know  </s>
<s> coolermaster extreme 500w it's a bit loud, but it'll get the job done and last a couple of years. the hd5770 doesn't need a lot of power... much less than an hd4850 in fact.  </s>
<s> a 450w power supply is fine for it.  </s>
<s> might just try the one i have if not i'll get the one you mentioned.  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> especially this one...it says &quot;pros: none, if your looking for a 360w then buy this one, nice for the price, but doesn't run my 9800 gtx+ cons: the power supply is really only a 360w not a 500w, check the label on side of the power supply..... manufacturer response:dear valued customer, we apologize for the inconvenience. the power supply is in total 500w.  </s>
<s> power supplies have multiple rails because computers need multiple rails or types of power to run.  </s>
<s> for the 12v rail, it dedicates 360w, for the 3.3v and 5v it dedicates 165w, for the -12v 6w and for the +5vsb 12.5w when all added together equals 500w. the spec sheet is available via the link below.  </s>
<s> your video card requires two six pin pci express connectors which the power supply provides.  </s>
<s> should the power supply be faulty, you can rma the power supply via the link below.  </s>
<s> respectfully, cmusa - customer support.  </s>
<s> external link(s): psu spec| rma|&quot;  </s>
<s> but that's what makes it's so hard to get a budget psu that has great reviews.  </s>
<s> i've looked a lot and can't really find one that is worth getting.  </s>
<s> antec truepower new tp-550 550w is suit to you.  </s>
<s> link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp?product_id=70618  </s>
<s> i've got a couple of these in service and they hold up well.  </s>
<s> and coolermaster gets good reviews on sites that do reviews using proper test equipment.  </s>
<s> the power supply label clearly shows that it has 2 18a 12v rails totalling 360w. the rest of the 500w is devoted to 5v/3.3v... that's normal for any power supply.  </s>
<s> a typical pc with an hd 5770 under full load drew less than 300w from the outlet. the coolermaster will be fine.  </s>
<s> just because it's a chevy and not a bmw doesn't mean it won't give 100k miles of transportation.  </s>
<s> well for you.  </s>
<s> nonetheless i wouldn't buy the cm rs-500 for a pc unless it was used strictly as a bench spare.  </s>
<s> accordingly i couldn't recommend one for use in a gaming system for someone asking recommendation here.  </s>
<s> looking at the gpu specs for the sapphire hd5770, it clearly states 400w as a min psu .. another hd5770 shows 500w as min. the combined wattage of that psu is only 430w despite the fact it advertises as a 500w.  </s>
<s> even the corsair 450w psu beats it in 12v wattage, efficiency warranty,12v amps (33 vs 30), review ratings and buyer ratings.  </s>
<s> but buyer reviews/comments for the cm rs500 reflect doas, short use deaths ... there isn't much subjective about those events.  </s>
<s> for what it's worth, i'm not recommending bmws but products i've read reviews about, i've read buyer ratings on and ultimately products by mfgs i personally own . . .  </s>
<s> corsair, seasonic and antec psus.  </s>
