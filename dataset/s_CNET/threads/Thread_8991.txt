11166	8	368021	3171844	3171698	r. proffitt	11/11/09 3:53 am	1.25791158e12	about the address.	the repeating cause is wep. it does that if one character is off in the password. this is one reason among the security issue with wep i move to wpa. and in this forum is our preferred router wifi settings. share those. also, be careful not to have 2 wifi managers. my old laptop was loaned out and somehow they turned on the second wifi connection manager. sorry, no but i can't recall or know all the methods to get this back to just one. but i'm leaning to always using the windows wireless zero configuration tool for all machines. bob
