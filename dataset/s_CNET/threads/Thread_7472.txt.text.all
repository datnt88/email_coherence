<s> i have dsl with at&t at home.  </s>
<s> they gave us a modem (2wire logos included) and that is what we use to connect to connect to the internet, no signal amplifiers or anything.  </s>
<s> we pay for the 3 mb/sec plan.  </s>
<s> my question is twofold: one: how would a router play into this and what do routers do differently from modems, and two: if the router increases speed and we only get a certain speed from at&t, how does that work or is the 3 mb/sec bandwidth.  </s>
<s> can someone help explain all of the different parts of a network (and yes, i know what an ethernet cable and wi-fi are).  </s>
<s> thank you!  </s>
<s> then you are mostly there.  </s>
<s> as i see it, routers enable two things; 1] wireless access to the internet for wireless capable computers anywhere around the home, and 2] more than one computer connected to the internet at once. the setup is computer --&gt; router --&gt; modem --&gt; internet.  </s>
<s> if you have a modem that allows more than one computer to access the internet, then you do not physically need any other hardware equipment.  </s>
<s> routers do not speed up your internet connection.  </s>
<s> if you have a 3 mb/s plan, you will not get faster speeds.  </s>
<s> in fact there is some slight slow down, but that is insignificant to us.  </s>
<s> mark  </s>
<s> ok that is helpful thank you! our modem connects up to 8 devices to the network at the same time (albeit rarely more than 4) on all platforms and using both ethernet and wireless.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't to slow it down.  </s>
<s> also, if i don't need one, what kind of people do?  </s>
<s> i see them in ads all of the time but we were provided a modem from at&t and when it broke could only buy a replacement that was of a specific model at best buy.  </s>
<s> are routers if you don't get a modem for free?  </s>
<s> and if routers do not speed up the network, then do they make more bandwidth, increase range, or just support faster networks (depending on 802.11 a/b/g/n or whatever the router is)?  </s>
<s> thank you!  </s>
<s> that you have a wireless modem that acts as a router as well, and if so, in your case, you don't need any other hardware.  </s>
<s> i need a modem. the modem supplied by my isp is just that, a modem.  </s>
<s> but i have 3 computers around the house, and all need internet access at some time or other.  </s>
<s> my main one is connected directly to the router via cable, and the other two are wirelessly connected.  </s>
<s> i assume other users have similar needs.  </s>
<s> however, like yourself, if my modem fails i need a replacement from my isp, and i can't do anything about that.  </s>
<s> (i imagine others with technical know-how could, but that is not me, and i prefer to stay on the good side of my isp).  </s>
<s> when we were using dial-up, we could use any dial-up modem we liked.  </s>
<s> but with cable tv and cable broadband, as i understand it, the isp has control of what modems we use.  </s>
<s> don't get confused by internet connection speed and bandwidth.  </s>
<s> in many ways they are the same.  </s>
<s> your connection speed of 3mb/sec is your maximum bandwidth, and sharing this between up to 8 devices will divide that bandwidth between all the devices.  </s>
<s> however, bandwidth can also be affected by outside influences.  </s>
<s> for example on my street many of the houses are cabled connected by one provider.  </s>
<s> in the early days if the whole street was online, my own bandwidth shrank considerably because the isp could not provide more.  </s>
<s> that rarely happens now and i seem to experience full bandwidth of my chosen plan most of the time.  </s>
<s> one thing you mentioned can apply.  </s>
<s> range.  </s>
<s> wireless routers will increase the range, up to 300 feet, depending on the router used.  </s>
<s> a wired connection will degrade the longer the cable is, but i am given to understand that this can also extend to some 200-300 feet.  </s>
<s> however, wireless is much easier to set up over these ranges.  </s>
<s> also, cables can deteriorate when exposed to the elements.  </s>
<s> others here will have much better knowledge than i do.  </s>
<s> i can only say the limited amount i know, but is there anything specific you are having problems with, or are considering?  </s>
<s> hope that helps so far.  </s>
<s> mark  </s>
<s> and is what i was looking for.  </s>
<s> thanks so much!  </s>
