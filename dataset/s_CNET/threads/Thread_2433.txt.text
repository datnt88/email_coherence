i am considering purchasng a jump drive to back up my computer. is this feasible? how would i know how many mbs or gbs i would need? thanks!
if you have 40gb of disk data to back up to achieve a reliable backup you need 3 copies. 1 for storage away from the machine, number 2 as the copy that you will not overwrite during backup and number 3 will be the set you use to backup to. since 1gb jumpdrives are fairly common, you need 120 of these units and with that many lets say you get them at the discount/sale price of 59 bucks each. $7,080 later and heavy in debt you wonder if this was a good idea. dvdrw backup seems cheaper. bob
maybe you should consider a externial usb harddrive for the task. john
1. has a write protect switch. 2. you have 3 of them. 3. you keep one out of the building that has the pc. bob
yes, only if people would do backups. i know of a lot of compainies that don't have good backups. and thats scary. john
