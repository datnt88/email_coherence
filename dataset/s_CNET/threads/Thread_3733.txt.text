can i use this external drives software to auto back up two laptops?
look up acronis.
there is one other problem here. that's not a proper backup but a &quot;good copy.&quot; backup systems include multiple copies on media that is keep away from the site. that is, when you backup to media item 1, there is a media item 2 that is not attached to the computer and should be far away. otherwise you could be destroying what was on media 1 and therefore had no backup. bob
