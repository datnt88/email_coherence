<s> after you are connected to the vpn search for the computer you are looking for.  </s>
<s> you should then be able to double click on it and access the shared folders...  </s>
<s> once you vpn to the other machine, it's not unlike you unplugged from your network and plugged into that remote network.  </s>
<s> to allow access to both at the same time would be a violation of what a vpn does.  </s>
