i have bought an hp c3180 &quot;all-in-one&quot; (scanner/printer/copier). but when i try to install it, it is not even detected by the system. i booted under linux and ran the 'lsusb' program to detect usb devices; it isn't even there. searching has found that this printer needs an &quot;usb 2.0 cable&quot;. can someone confirm this? thanks!!
send it back. i find the old usb 1.1 cable to be fine even at this but then again that front usb port wiring issue is why i test with rear usb ports. as to usb 2.0 cables, i gifted all my old cables away and replaced them with the 99 cent usb 2.0 cables from geeks.com or newegg.com i see no reason to keep the old cables and any issues they harbor. best of luck, bob
i got a c3180 when i bought my new imac...when i installed it it very definately states when to connect to my mac with a usb cable...my problen is that it identified itse lf as a 3100 series..gave a different serial number..when i got to the part of a setup assistant..it told its name(that i couldn't change) and then congradulated me on a success ful set up!!!!!!!!!one of the other windows is suppose to give name and something else and installable options..after about a minute it says that it is a empty selection...all of them. as far as i can tell..it works ok...prints copies haven't scanned yet. so what is wrongand how do i fix it? thanks everybody......this newbie, michele 20&quot; intel mac 2.16 ghz core duo, tiger 10.0408, 2gb memory,
