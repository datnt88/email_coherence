using a dell latitude 131l laptop on xp pro sp3. just recently the keyboard typing rate on all applications has really slowed down. i have checked some of the standard things, spywear scan, accessibility setting, keyboard setting, but all look normal. i have re-booted into safe mode and the problem goes away!! does anyone have a suggestion how to fix it? thanks in advance for your help.
i have a dell 1501 with xp and doing same dang thing......... working on it at present will let u know if i find it........
found this on another forum and it worked for my dell 1501, hope it works or you. disable the ati hotkey poller service in windows. go to start-&gt;control panel-&gt;administrative tools-&gt;services you should see the ati hotkey poller services listed. right click on it and select properties. halfway down the screen you should see the &quot;startup type.&quot; choose disabled from the drop-down list, click apply, close out all applications and reboot. this should resolve your issues.
thanks lupeys, that worked for me! - dell 131l
