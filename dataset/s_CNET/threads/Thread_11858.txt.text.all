<s> can anybody offer me any advice regarding connecting my lcd tv as a monitor for my laptop?  </s>
<s> i have a sharpe aquos lc26 ga5e lcd tv and an acer aspire 5510 media centre laptop. the tv has pc input and i have tried plugging it in to the laptop but cant seem to get it to work properly.  </s>
<s> when i turn it on the windows screen appears on the tv but the welcome screen doesnt, it appears on the laptop and then the desktop appears on the laptop.  </s>
<s> ive tried checking the extend my windows desktop box in display properties but that doesnt help.  </s>
<s> my desktop wallpaper appears on the tv but none of the icons on my desktop do.  </s>
<s> if i drag a window to the right of my laptop monitor, it will disappear and then reappears on the tv. there must be a way that i can either use it as a stand alone monitor or i should be able to have the same images on both screens.  </s>
<s> i can do this if i connect my laptop to the monitor i have on my desktop pc. ive tried looking on sharpes website to see if there are any drivers that i need, but they dont appear to have a support page.  </s>
<s> any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  </s>

<s> ...your desktop is extended.  </s>
<s> the lcd tv is now extended screen space to the right of your main display (the laptop screen).  </s>
<s> nothing will appear on it unless your drag it there.  </s>
<s> you can 'swap' the displays if the &quot;use this device as my primary display&quot; checkbox is available in display properties when the tv is selected.  </s>
<s> if you want to see the same thing on your laptop and tv, you'll need to clone the display.  </s>
<s> some laptops do this via the display properties and others do it via a hotkey.  </s>
<s> hi ramarc, i understand about extending the desktop, but when i try cloning it doesn't work, &quot;use this device as my primary display&quot; is greyed out as my laptop has a hotkey as you suggest, but when i use it with the tv is connected it doesn't work.  </s>
<s> it does work if i connect to my desktop pc monitor though.  </s>
<s> any further thoughts?  </s>
<s> regards mike  </s>
<s> when connected to the laptop as an extended display?  </s>
<s> also, what model laptop and tv do you have?  </s>
<s> i've found some laptops handle two monitors very well while others are finicky.  </s>
<s> my toshiba with a geforce go was simple as pie; my wife's compaq with intel gma was easy also.  </s>
<s> my friends compaq with an ati 9000 was a nightmare to get working right with multiple displays.  </s>
<s> you might also want to hit the forums for your laptop mfg and pose the question there.  </s>
