my xerox textronic 850 phaser printer is on it's last legs. it has served me well, but i don't need a printer with a capacity of 500 copies per month. any recommendations on a great color laser printer in the $500-650 range?
konica minolta magicolor 2530 dl laser printer hewlett packard laserjet 2605dn printer good luck!
just purchased the hp laserjet 2025dn. it is not too pricy, very fast and the color quality is excellent.
