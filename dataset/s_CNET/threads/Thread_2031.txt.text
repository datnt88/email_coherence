hi all, i have a mac pro running dual quad-core intel xeon processors. i use two displays, an apple 30&quot; cinema display and a 27&quot; display, which i use side-by-side. recently, my 27&quot; display has been having difficulties that are reminiscent of the special effects used in the matrix movies when the character is dodging bullets - when moving an open document or window on the 27&quot; display, it suddenly begins leaving a trail of ghost images behind that completely muck up the screen. generally, i can correct the problem by grabbing another open document and moving it all over the screen - in effect using it to &quot;wash&quot; away all the duplicate images. i'm trying to figure out if this is a problem that can be easily corrected (perhaps a memory or cache issue) vs. some sort of fatal hardware or video card issue. i have a screenshot of this, but i'm a newbie to this forum and unsure if i can easily link it to my post. i'd be grateful for advice with this problem.
given the machine story so far can you reveal how long since you did the usual canned air on the heatsinks (maintenence)? i find many users never do that. bob
thanks for your reply, bob. i realized that i have four video cards in this machine, so i switched that display to one of the other cards and it seemed to solve the problem. regarding the heat sinks, i recently vacuumed out the the entire unit, but prior to doing so, it had accumulated a lot of dust. poor maintenance might have overheated my video card prior to the recent cleaning.. regards, jim
