i have recently reinstalled windows xp on an hp computer which has the 9 in 1 card reader built in. my problem is that now when i go to 'my computer' instead of having the drive names all that they say is removable disk. i am sure all i need is the drivers but i check at hp and could not find them for the hp pavilion a523x. thanks for you help. gary
gary, did you ever solve this problem ? i have just re-installed my system and have the same problem. how did you fix it, do you have the drivers that i need. email me direct: sbergman@iinet.net.au thanks steve
hey guy's i ran into the same problem. here is a link to the driver download from hp's website. good luck.  john chapman geekstoyou.net
searching for the driver last night i came across this site. thanks a million for the link. i could not find it. thanks.
i was able to find the driver, but for them to work you must have at least service pack 1 installed for them to work. gary
