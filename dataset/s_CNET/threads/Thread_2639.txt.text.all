<s> i've been going bonkers trying to find a program that would allow me to transfer my 9mm tapes on my camcorder, and record them on to my harddrive.  </s>
<s> i'm using a sony vaio and it has the composite cables.  </s>
<s> i used to use the program that came iwth the computer called giga pocket, but recently the computer completely crashed and i had to reformat using a windows xp disk.  </s>
<s> so here i am, unable to find giga pocket or any program that can also be used in the same manner.  </s>
<s> any help or suggestions from another fellow human being will be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> notes where to download the driver.  </s>
<s> but if you didn't use the restore cds you may have to start over with the right cds.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i don' have any cds, which is why i'm stuck.  </s>
<s> i've came across the drivers and they don't do anything unless i have the program installed.  </s>
<s> giga pocket is a dead end, unless i find a torrent which i can't find.  </s>
<s> i just need an alternative program that can do the same thing giga pocket does, which is have the program record from the av/component cables in my video card onto the desktop.  </s>
<s> try this one.  </s>
<s> i only has one seed so i don't know if it will work -good luck.  </s>
<s> hah, i've tried this, it got up to 4 percent and then all the peers dropped to 0 and now nothing connects  </s>
<s> i'll try downloading it for you.  </s>
<s> it's at 11% right now downloading at 50kbp/s.  </s>
<s> you are downloading from a seeder?  </s>
<s> there are an even number of seeds and peers (4) i am currently at 48%.  </s>
<s> you know...i opened up the torrent again...and i'm connected to one peer which has 61.7% completed which is probably you.  </s>
<s> i'm at 44.7 percent.  </s>
<s> i wonder why that is...i hope it doesn't stop or turn blue  </s>
<s> that's me since i'm at 63% now.  </s>
<s> i'll keeping seeding until you get it.  </s>
<s> i don't like saying thank you because i think humans should just always do nice things for other humans.  </s>
<s> majority of us don't, but you are one of the few that actually does exist.  </s>
<s> i think.  </s>
<s> but thanks a list.cnet.remains  </s>
<s> more_fragments more_threads pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> s.cnet.dev  </s>
<s> s.cnet.test  </s>
<s> s.cnet.train  </s>
<s> scripts threads load, i've been working on this for the past 7 hours  </s>
<s> you have no idea how happy you've made me.  </s>
<s> i was just starting to resort to alcohol to calm myself down.  </s>
<s> take care  </s>
<s> nothing makes me happier then when i'm helping someone else.  </s>
<s> i hope you got all of it, my client stopped seeding.  </s>
<s> take care mate.  </s>
<s> sony is your primary support, why not contact them for proper cd replacements(some cost), etc.. using torrent if possible and could end in yet another issue.  </s>
<s> no matter how you finally get your system up and running at 100%, be sure to backup and/or create recovery cds for an easier recovery next time.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
