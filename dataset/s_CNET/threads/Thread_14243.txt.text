i'm thinking of selling my pc on ebay i just need your thoughts on a price appropriate for it. motherboard: gigabyte gak8n51pvmt-9,socket 939,pci express x16 & x1,2 pci, ddr3200 (400mhz) cpu: amd athlon 64 3700+ 2.2ghz memory: 2gb ddr3200 ocz dual channel ram 4x512mb graphics card: sapphire ati radeon x1950 pro ultimate (zalman fan, runs so cold) hard drive: 250gb maxtor sata2 3gbps psu: sansun arctic 500w 6pin for gpu and dual core support
see what they go for on ebay.
example at  your's has a great video card, but this has an os.
so around the 200 region is probably best suited? i got a friend interested at 250. the operating system i have running is xp media center however i have more on cd.
let's be sure you know that such result in a locked discussion too. my example is not for you. find ebay or such in your country. bob
the operating systems are not pirate,m they were bough oem so i got them pretty cheap off the internet.
