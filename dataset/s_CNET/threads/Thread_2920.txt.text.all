<s> i am not sure where to post this.  </s>
<s> i am looking for ibm compatible ps2 type keyboard that uses 120ma power consumtion or less.  </s>
<s> what is exactly is that type of keyboard.  </s>
<s> i looked online to see if i could find one but nothing lists the power consumption.  </s>
<s> any help will be appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> but no one specs that anymore so you'll have to measure a few to see what they do.  </s>
<s> it's all of one measurement with an ammeter.  </s>

<s> what a bummer so you are saying it is just hit and miss?  </s>
<s> i will tell you what i am using it for, i have to enter disc info on my mega dvd player and it requires that type of keyboard i already have one for my computer and it doesn't work.  </s>
<s> let me ask you would the ones without all of the multimedia buttons be a good start to check?  </s>
<s> that's a little clearer.  </s>
<s> i wonder why you didn't share the make/model of this thing to start with.  </s>
<s> you could have helped members help you without all the back and forths.  </s>
<s> yup, i'd try a &quot;plain&quot; keyboard.  </s>

<s> sorry but i thought i mentioned that because the keyboard that didn't work with my new sony dvd player worked with my older sony cd player and they both specified the same keyboard.  </s>
<s> i was confused about that.  </s>
<s> it was a important point.  </s>
<s> a pre senior moment on my part.  </s>
<s> it's one of those little bits of information that could have someone write they have it and use some specific keyboard.  </s>
