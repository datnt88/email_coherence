<s> i have a netgear wgr614v3, and ever since i've set it up, the connection drops every few hours (sometimes more than that).  </s>
<s> restarting the router does the trick, but it's a big problem.  </s>
<s> i have a comcast cable connection, and there's no problem when the modem and computer are directly connected.  </s>
<s> my main computer is connected to the router via ethernet, and then about 3 or 4 of my housemates connect over the wireless.  </s>
<s> i've updated the firmware, enabled wpa, broadcast the ssid.  </s>
<s> any idea what's causing the constant disconnections?  </s>
<s> is this an interference problem?  </s>
<s> something to do with ip addresses?  </s>
<s> or is netgear just unreliable?  </s>
<s> you didn't reveal that so my bet is some external 2.4ghz interference.  </s>
<s> but my instinct is p2p use.  </s>
<s> it's written about widely.  </s>

<s> the connection problems continue even when all p2p programs are shut down (and no one else is on the network).  </s>
<s> if the interference is due to a microwave or something like that, is there anything that can be done?  </s>
<s> or should i just switch to one of the different wireless bandwidths?  </s>
<s> thanks for your speedy reply!  </s>
<s> after the loss, stopping the p2p program will not restore the router.  </s>
<s> you have to wait 5 days!  </s>
<s> i'm not kidding.  </s>
<s> read the links at the bottom lead you to possible fixes.  </s>
<s> but this is not the router to have if you use p2p.  </s>
