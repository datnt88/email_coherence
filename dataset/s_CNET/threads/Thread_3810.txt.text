does anybody know of a value that i can put into the mouse registry to make it more precise?
the preciseness of a mouse comes from the hardware's dpi measurement. wikipedia: dots per inch i might be wrong... but that's what i &quot;know&quot;
on this machine. if i go to control panel&gt;mouse. i can adjust the sensitivity of the mouse/pointer.
would that actually make it smoother? yea it would be smoother but it would be a pain if it's so low that it takes like 3 seconds to get on opposite corners of the screen :p i think my best bet is to actually get a high quality mouse.
