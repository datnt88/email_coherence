i have two computers in one room which i currently want to connect to the internet. (one is an hp intel pentium4 and the other a compaq presario) the hp intel pent.4 computer currently connects to the internet (broadband) via wireless from the main computer (in another room). i want to connect the compaq to the internet aswell but i only have a cat 5 utp crossover cable connecting the hp intel pentium 4 computer to the compaq presario. is it possible to establish an internet connection using this cat5 cable or should i shell out top dollar for yet another wireless card? urgent help needed, thank you, p.
by the way the cable says (on the pack) rj45/m-rj/mo.5m utpe-x5
what type of internet service: cable, dsl, edge, evdo other? if cable/dsl what modem and/or router model? if edge/evdo, what is the wireless card model and service provider. the options i see thus far are: - internet connection sharing (ics) - router if you give more specifics, then we can give more specifics.
