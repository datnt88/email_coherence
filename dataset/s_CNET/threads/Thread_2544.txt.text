i was just wondering if my power supply (corsair 80+ 750w non-modular) is enough to handle the components in my future computer upgrade. i plan to have: intel core i7 3770k asus sabertooth thermal armour amd radeon 7970 (overclocked ~10-20%) ssd hdd 8gb 1333mhz ram
with that 250w gpu you might be pushing it a little. if the budget allows.......a 1kw unit would be nice.
this card. i like headroom so i'd opt for an 850 or maybe a 950....depending on what's reasonably priced at the 850-950 range. vapcmd
