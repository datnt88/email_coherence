i have a computer with xp. lets call it pc1. it has a wireless card that connects to a router for the internet. a printer is hooked up to pc1. i have another computer pc2 with windows me hooked up to pc1 with a cross over cable. the conection works for the internet, but when i bring in a laptop with a wireless conection to pc1 it wont let me print. i cant connect pc2 to the router. i shared the printer and files when i went thru the wizard. i checked the printer and its shared. not sure where to go.
if i have this new laptop and i logged in as bob then i need an account on the machine with the printer called &quot;bob&quot; as well as the printer driver on my laptop. bob
the laptop could print before i connected the cross over cable. when i connect the cable, then the laptop cant print.
sorry, but crossover cables and connections to the pc with such are simply hack jobs that require whoever does that to keep notes about how they did that. i'm going to share that it all works fine in the normal way of connections from the internet to the router and then to the computers. bob
&quot;the laptop could print before i connected the cross over cable. when i connect the cable, then the laptop cant print.&quot; don't do that.
i need the cross over cable from pc2 to pc1 so i can connect to the internet.
there is an issue with windows network shares in your setup. they may not work &quot;all the time.&quot; good luck with that setup. bob
