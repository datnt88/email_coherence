i have a sony vaio pcgfxa6 laptop xphome windows with combo cdrw/dvdrom. dvds and cd data roms are played fine but audio cds are not recognized. what can i do?
its too possible to be a hardware issue. let them fix it. if it's a recent event, use system restore to when it worked or just reload their restore cds. bob
guarantee is over. it will cost me 45 bucks. any other idea?
only 3 options... 1. new drive. 2. try an cd lens cleaner. 3. use some usb cdrw/dvd or such. bob
thank you anyway
