11785	13	210033	2249149	2248795	sibtiger	10/6/06 9:49 pm	1.16017134e12	re: density isn't what dictates a hard drive access speed!!	obviously rpms play a much bigger role in drive speed. but density does have an effect on speed. compare drive speeds of higher density drives vs lower density at same rpms.
11785	14	210033	2252747	2248200	itskier	10/9/06 7:52 am	1.16038032e12	newer hard drives	i have to weigh in, we have about 10 newer computers that shipped with sata hard drives about five of the drives have failed within the 1 year warranty period. the older ata 100 drives have been going and going with no failed drives for probably six years. i am not sure that sata is ready or if we just got a bunch over the last year from the same batch of bad quality drives. this may help you decide to go with a more tested and reliable technology but in the specs it is slower spindle speed will not show up to the end users but bus speed may (slower may be faster in the long run if your drive fails). ata 100/133 still makes pretty big drives. check you mother board for compatibility.
