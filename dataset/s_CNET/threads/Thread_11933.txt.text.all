i have three computers, two of them have been networked already using a hub, but aren't connected to the internet. 
i also have another computer hooked up to the internet. 
if i have a router in between the internet and the non-networked computer, can i connect the hub and the router to connect the other two computers to the intrernet? 
thanks. 
the cable/dsl connection can be shared to all computers by plugging into the router. 
plug all computers into the hub, plug the hub into the router. 
just connect them all to a router. 
the two computers that have previously been networked are right next to each other. the other computer and the internet connection are about 50 feet away. 
i probably will go the wireless route at some point, but for right now, i'd like to get something going.
