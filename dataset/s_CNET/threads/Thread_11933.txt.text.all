<s> i have three computers, two of them have been networked already using a hub, but aren't connected to the internet.  </s>
<s> i also have another computer hooked up to the internet.  </s>
<s> if i have a router in between the internet and the non-networked computer, can i connect the hub and the router to connect the other two computers to the intrernet?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> the cable/dsl connection can be shared to all computers by plugging into the router.  </s>
<s> plug all computers into the hub, plug the hub into the router.  </s>
<s> just connect them all to a router.  </s>
<s> the two computers that have previously been networked are right next to each other. the other computer and the internet connection are about 50 feet away.  </s>
<s> i probably will go the wireless route at some point, but for right now, i'd like to get something going.  </s>
