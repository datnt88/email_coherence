<s> in my event viewer, there are numerous entries for a 'bad block' on my hard drive.  </s>
<s> a friend of mine suggested that i do not need a new hard drive, but to merely mark that spot as unusable with some third-party software (norton?). my question is two fold: 1.) should i be concerned with the bad block to the point of buying a new drive?  </s>
<s> 2.) if #1 is not necessary, can i use a tool to make the bad block disappear/hidden?  </s>
<s> if so, what tool would be a good one to try?  </s>
<s> also, i have backed up all of my important data, so that part is taken care of.  </s>
<s> i am running an amd athlon 2700+ with 1gb ram and maxtor 160gb hard drive on winxp pro (sp1).  </s>
<s> thanks for all your help in advance!  </s>
<s> you may get a report and a replacement drive.  </s>
<s> however, if you connected said drive with a 40 conductor ide cable, errors are common.  </s>
<s> also, errors are common in overheated cases or stressed power supplies.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thansk bob. the drive is connected via ide and my temp monitoring software has not alerted me of any problems, so i don't suspect that. the power supply shouldn't be suspect either.  </s>
<s> the only extra perifs are dvd-r (no fdd, 2nd cd, etc.) i'll try the maxtor software.  </s>
<s> didn't think of that...  </s>
