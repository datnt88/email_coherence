i got a new dell inspirion 9300 and it has intel centrino mobile technology and has a wireless internet card. but i dont pick up any signals because i am in a military base and i was wondering how to set up a internet router on my laptop without a pc.
you have the hardware, do you have the internet provider to connect to? if you don't have one, then how do you expect to browse the internet? if you are hoping, there are some wireless signal in your area.. then think again.. you are in a military base... probably they banned all signal..
just connect the wireless router/modem to your provider line.. configure it.. (give it a name/ssid, enable wep/wpa/wpa2 security, then your laptop will pick up the signal... enter the name and password required (you create this when you enable the security).. thats it...
