any body can show me how to print the logo on thermal receipt printer. i use printer rp 300 (partner tech) my os is winxp. thank for instruction. longlt
notes that this printer (yours uses the same command codes) can do this, but since i consider this not a freebie endeavor i will only share its possible and don't do such work for free. sorry, bob
dear mr. bob, can you instruction me like that: - there is program, that can load bitmap into printer, in this program, it can send command to order printer print out that bitmap. ( you can see this program: epson tm flash logo utility's in  ) - but how to order printer print out that bitmap in other aplication program? it mean i have to know the command line and write it in printer drive such as generic/text only. (in this drive, i can adding command line to printer) here is i don't know exactly how to set the command to order printer print out bitmap such as flash program. hope that you can know my mind and show me where can find that knowleadge. thank for your instruction. long lt
i don't do many pos systems or terminals. however, those that were done, suggest that the printer comes &quot;pre-loaded&quot; and was replaced. i haven't seen one programmed out in the field. the process maybe easy to do to transfer the logo, but not the make-up of the logo, so alot is in the air. at best, you may get by with some &quot;text message&quot;. on top of that some special s/w or standalone h/w would be needed to deal directly with the ptr. at hand. tada -----willy
