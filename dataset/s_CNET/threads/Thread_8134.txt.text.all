<s> i have bought a di-524 wireless router.  </s>
<s> i followed all the instructions to configure the router's hardware and software and after several calls to d-link, i achieved success.  </s>
<s> i have my notebook connected to lan port 1 on the router and an old windows 98 computer has a d-link wireless pci card in it.  </s>
<s> it all worked.  </s>
<s> both computers could access the internet and i set up a small home network successfully.  </s>
<s> when i turned my notebook on the next morning, my entire d-link folder and contents had disappeared -- evaporated. it was as though windows xp had decided it could do a better job of running a wireless newtwork than d-link configuration could.  </s>
<s> much to my surprise, the wireless network still works -- sort of.  </s>
<s> every 10 to 60 seconds, a balloon pops up in the system tray of my notebook telling me a network cable is unplugged, but it isn't. the system instantly reconnects itself and i can carry on surfing the internet.  </s>
<s> my internet phone which i use for long distance calls and my live365 radio, both of which i have used for years without problems, disconnect each time the balloon comes up -- but these two applications will not automatically reconnect as the internet will.  </s>
<s> so, i can not use my pcphone or listen to internet radio anymore. the strangest of all is that yesterday, i had a whole day of no balloons or dropped signals.  </s>
<s> everything worked perfectly.  </s>
<s> i listened to the radio and made several voip calls.  </s>
<s> the days before i had problems.  </s>
<s> today i have problems.  </s>
<s> yesterday, i had no problems.  </s>
<s> i have added no software or hardware.  </s>
<s> i have made no changes.  </s>
<s> can anyone offer advice?  </s>
<s> i'm at my wit's end.  </s>
<s> there's a recent firmware update to the 524.  </s>
<s> got it installed yet?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> no i haven't.  </s>
<s> my windows xp threw out my firmware.  </s>
<s> what do you recommend?  </s>
<s> bill  </s>
<s> my 524 never worked better with the latest.  </s>
