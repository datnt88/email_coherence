<s> please suggest the best option for an easy &quot;back up&quot; of my files... mostly pics, music and such.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> 1. no write protect.  </s>
<s> a virus could wipe out the connected drive.  </s>
<s> 2. no duplicate copy.  </s>
<s> where's the second and third copy?  </s>
<s> 3. same failure modes (actually more) as the hard disk in the pc. while an external drive makes a fine &quot;copy&quot; it fails the classic criteria for &quot;backup.&quot;  </s>
<s> do you have a dvd recorder?  </s>
<s> my entire photo collection fits on on dvdrw.  </s>
<s> my other stuff fits on 2 other dvdrws.  </s>
<s> cost?  </s>
<s> a few dollars.  </s>
<s> and i have multiple copies.  </s>

<s> summarizing bobs post: depends on size u'd like to backup.  </s>
<s> well, dvds max holds 1.3 gb data.  </s>
<s> whenas size of external hdds can be choosen (i guess there is even more than 60gb).  </s>
<s> and one more question : are u going to use certain backup software?  </s>
<s> i thought dvds could hold 4.7gb and dual-layer dvds could hold almost twice as much.  </s>
