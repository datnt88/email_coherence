<s> i am running a wireless router and am wondering if i can also use a wireless keyboard and mouse.  </s>
<s> will i run into frequency problems if i have to many wireless items on my computers?  </s>
<s> does anyone know if this is a problem?  </s>
<s> i would like to add a wireless keyboard and mouse to both computers in the house, but am not sure if this is even possible with the wireless router.  </s>
<s> no conflict between my linksys wireless router and my ms wireless keyboard and mouse.  </s>
<s> they sit inches away from each other, i believe they are in different fq ranges.  </s>
<s> it is unlikely there will be any conflicts, even if they run the same, or nearly the same, frequency.  </s>
<s> sort of like if you were in a large room with a lot of people all talking, yet you are able to single out the one person who has your attention at the moment.  </s>
<s> that same scenario becomes even more plain, if you add in the possibility that some of those people are talking different languages.  </s>
<s> to hone in on just your language becomes even easier.  </s>
<s> back to the wireless scenario, there are different kinds of wireless, too.  </s>
<s> there are wireless 802.11a standards that is a totally different frequency (5ghz) than 802.11b or g (2.4ghz), there is bluetooth wireless (2.45ghz), there is 900mhz wireless, there is infrared wireless (also a frequency, but it is in the light spectrum - far above the radio spectrum), lots of different kinds.  </s>
<s> in my own case, i have a wireless keyboard and mouse, i have a wireless router and bridge (802.11b) and i also have a wireless phone (2.7ghz). the only thing i get, that supposedly is a minor noise conflict is with the wireless phone that runs near the same frequency as the router.  </s>
<s> i hear a slight &quot;click&quot; every few seconds in the phone.  </s>
<s> it isn't bad, and the other party does not hear it at all. the digital devices don't get that conflict at all.  </s>
<s> even if the items ran on the same frequency, there are bands, protocols, and other identifying factors used by matched devices and ignored by similar devices.  </s>
<s> if, by some odd chance, there is any conflict, just keep your receipts, and return what gives you a problem.  </s>
<s> i have had a wireless router and a logitech wireless keyboard as well as a logitec wireless optical trackball for over a year and have yet to have a single problem... the only thing is when i have my feet on the desk or i have the receiver hidden behind something, i tend to lose connection (about 3-4 feet of clutttered deskspace).  </s>
<s> so i rake everything into the garbage can and then it works like a charm...  </s>
