<s> looking to buy new printer looking for multifunction with scan but big on photo quality,im not sure what to get.  </s>
<s> price isn't that big of factor just looking for quality that will last me a few years.  </s>
<s> please help!!!!!  </s>
<s> i am in the same market, but my own experience can tell you one thing.  </s>
<s> fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> threads do not buy lexmark printers ***. the color quality is sub-par at best, the inkjet cartridges are tiny (300 prints max per cartridge) and most printouts have a faded appearance, no matter how hard you &quot;tweak&quot; the printer settings.  </s>
<s> that's why they literally throw these printers at your when you buy pc's from any bigbox store.  </s>
<s> so, anyone else got advice???  </s>
<s> if you are looking for a aio that is great on photo printing and scanning, i would look at the canon pixma mp960 or the mp970.  </s>
<s> both are 7 cartridge printers that are made for photo printing and scanning.  </s>
<s> i would go into details but cnet did a good job of reviewing them.  </s>
