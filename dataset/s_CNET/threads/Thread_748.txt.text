hi guys, i recently got one very old configuration p4 machine. it contains 512mb ram card, as checked by me. the problem here is, in system properties it shows only &quot;96mb of ram&quot;. i didn't find any configuration in bios(although i am weak at checking bios). according to what i think, ram might be faulty or properly working. if it is faulty the system wont boot. but here, i am unable to understand the issue. pleas guide. regards, uv
are you sure that wasnt 96mb for video card memoery, not system memory? i dont think you can run a os on only 96mb memory
i also dont think that system will boot if ram is too low as 96mb. i am unable to make out whether any configuration has been done at the bios level. because of which i am posting this query. system configuration is p4 1.5ghz processor motherboard - mecury - very old model (if you want i can post the model number too.) ram - 512mb sdram (obsolete in market) how did i come to know that windows os is showing me 96mb - in my computer i checked for hardware properties. over there is showed me 96mb of ram. is there any other way to check the ram in windows xp os. also please suggest some solution for this?? regards, uv
try the program. it will tell you your memory type and size, along with your cpu and motherboard
