(you probably get a blue and red steady light....that is fine). hopefully, if all goes right, this will allow you to now communicate with the wre54g. (auto configuration is not possible). now to test this: go into your start menu and click on &quot;run&quot; and type in the comannd &quot;cmd&quot;....this will give you a dos prompt window. now type in &quot;ping 192.168.1.240&quot; (this is the preset ip address of the wre54g.) at this point you will get several lines of numbers and stuff...ignore everything except at the bottom where it say's &quot;packets: sent = 4, recieved = 4, lost = 0 &lt;0% loss&gt;. if this is the case then you are looking good! now, open a web browser and type in 192.168.1.240 and wait for the linksys page to come up from your wre54g.....when/if this does come up then you have won the battle! next, and this is also very important. in the configuration of your wre54g the ssid must be the same as your router!!!! otherwise they will not communicate with each other. also the channels should be the same. now click on &quot;save setting&quot;, and it this time or shortly there after you should have 2 blue lights on your wre54g. at this time you can unplug it and place it anywhere in your house!!! please note: at the time of all this configuration my security on my router was disabled and later also on my expander. my signal now upstairs is now &quot;excellant&quot; and the signal is maxed out on my xbox 360.....now i have to figure out how to enable my security and at the same time not loose connection to my wre54g. i hope this was of some help to somebody out there and i appologize for this being so lengthy..... michael if you have any questions or helpful tips for me then please drop me a line..... mjdecker0922@yahoo.com thanks!
