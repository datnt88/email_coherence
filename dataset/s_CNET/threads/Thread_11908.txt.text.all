<s> i am currently looking for parts to build a computer and was wondering which processor was better.  </s>
<s> this new computer will be used mainly for surfing the web and listening to music.  </s>
<s> either one will problaly do just fine.  </s>
<s> so go with the least expensive one.  </s>
<s> if you look at the benchmarks out there, a celeron d at 2.4ghz will perform about the same as a sempron 2400+(1.667ghz).  </s>
<s> however, a sempron/motherboard combination will be a bit cheaper than a celeron d/motherboard combo.  </s>
<s> plus, the celeron d's are quite loud and run hot. the only time i would get a celeron d is if you wanted to overclock it.  </s>
