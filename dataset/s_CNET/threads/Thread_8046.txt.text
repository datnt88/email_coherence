my pc crashed (os windows xp home)and i want to retrieve data from the 80gb sata hd. i have removed hd and inserted into a usb sata caddy enclosure. i have connected caddy to my laptop (os vista) which displays as a local disk g. when i try to open it requests that i need to format the disk in drive g before i can use it, if i do this will i lose data,how can i access the data?? if it helps, in disk mgt drive g is raw file system and has healthy,active primary partition status. please help
the filesystem shouldn't be raw, but ntfs. that's why vista says it needs to be formatted. and, indeed, you'll lose everything that's on it. zero assumption recovery (from  ) usually is able to get the data from such disks. worth a try, although not free ($49.99). it's up to you to decide if your data is worth that much. hope this helps. kees
kees, many thanks for your prompt response. i used zars free evaluation version to recover all my precious family snaps. many thanks.
