if you had to choose between these two motherboards for your desktop pc, which one would you go for? 
asus p4s800d-x or tyan s5101an regardless of the price. 
thanks! 
only the choice between the two..i'd get the p4s. it has the 800fsb over the 533fsb. 
i have used asus exclusively for ten years and wouldn't think of using anything else. 
why not think about the p5? and life goes on... jack 
both are good mb, tyan is best known for server mbs .john
