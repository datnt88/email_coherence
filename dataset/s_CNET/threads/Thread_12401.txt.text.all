i would like to upgrade my dell dimension 8200 from p4 to a intel core 2 duo or pentium duel-core but what the information i have been getting from dell it's impossible to do. 
i would like to more opinions if it's possible to upgrade. 
you would have to change the power supply, motherboard, cpu, ram, video card so you saved the case and drives. 
it's also possible the keyboard and mouse needs changing and the os might not re-activate.

most would consider that both unwise and impractical.
