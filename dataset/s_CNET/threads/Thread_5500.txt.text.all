<s> you will need to upgrade but since you didn't post any specs on your computer, none of us can really help you except tell you to get a new video card but we can't tell you which one because we don't know what the slot of your motherboard is.  </s>
<s> konny  </s>
<s> 1. make and model number of pc 2. processor type and speed (rated in ghz i hope) 3. operating system 4. specific messages your are getting from trying to play particular games.  </s>
