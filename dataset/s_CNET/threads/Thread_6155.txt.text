just bought a buffalo whr-hp-g300n router that is capable of 300 mpbs. i have an hp dv4-1120us laptop with a built in broadcom 4322ag 802.11a/b/g/draft-n wifi adapter. got the router set up this morning, set it to the n settings, but my connection speed is still 54 mpbs. can anyone advise me on configuring my nic, or is it a waste of time? should i simply go with an n usb adapter? i'd like to take advantage of the faster router. thanks, steve
back in draft n days you learned that higher speeds only worked where the client and the router were from the same maker. the lesson repeats today. but a comment. since your internet connection is about 10 times slower than 54 megabit, why fix this? bob
well... i guess i got caught up in the numbers. i'm planning on buying a roku hd (xr) box  to stream pandora and netflix wirelessly and just thought if everything was set up to be as fast as possible, i'd have less issues.
i have a lenovo y530 over 802.11g and hulu does fine over 802.11g. i've tried cbs.com and a few others too. but there is one thing. my network is setup exactly like the sticky at the top of this forum. which is likely why i have so little trouble. bob
which sticky (exactly)?
there are a few. try the one with the most entries.
hmmm... well, nothing sounds very complicated there... i do have my new router working fine, connected all external devices with no problems. i just set it up wpa2-psk (tkip) at 40hz. seems fine, guess i'll find out when i hook up my roku. thanks, steve
but the forum sticky leans to wpa. i like wpa2 if only it would work with everything. bob
