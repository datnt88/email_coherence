<s> im in need of a laptop and i will need it for the everyday what not, but i will also be using it for dj'ing which needs speed.  </s>
<s> so... should i go for the... intel pentium m processor 730 (1.6ghz, 2mb l2 cache, 533mhz fsb) or mobile intel pentium 4 processor 538 (3.20ghz1, 1mb l2 cache) according to allot of research, i know its just gaming specs, but u can get an idea that these m cpu's dont suck in speed and even better than some p4's.  </s>
<s> but this is one of the reasons of the thread, im confused on this chip.  </s>
<s> the 64-bit wave is very much in plain sight now. the changeover will leave thousands with a bad taste in their mouth as they mumble about paying top dollar for just a 32-bit machine.  </s>
<s> i don't suggest the 3.2+ ghz p4 ht models since they are hot desktop replacements with short battery times.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> wnat chip would you suggest?  </s>
<s> im in need of speed and battery is not a problem for me.  </s>
<s> while at the office we are picking up athlon 64 r3000 laptops, that may not be enough for you.  </s>
<s> keep shopping if you don't want to complain in just 2 to 3 months over the 64-bit issue.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i just contacted hp/compaq support yesterday, and they said they were going to offer a bios update that will enable users with motherboards capable to upgrade to em64t processors to upgrade.  </s>
<s> when this comes out, i'll update the processor to 64-bit.  </s>
<s> unfortunately, i doubt compaq/hp will offer free processors, so you still have to get money out of your own pocket.  </s>
<s> but this is better than getting a new machine.  </s>
<s> quoted technician &quot;yes, sure it will be released in future.  </s>
<s> research is being carried out to check it workability.  </s>
<s> i will forward your messages to our research engineers and do my best to fasten the process.&quot;  </s>
<s> roger  </s>
<s> basically what that is saying is that if you have a pentium 4 sequence 5, they'll give you a sequence 6 once the bios revision is done, but not a new chip in 2006 (as they will probably require new chipsets (intel's new chips (just released) can't run on any of their chipsets, except the 945 and 955) i would wiat i'd wait for the intel yonah to be completed (it's a dual core version of the pentium m with 64-bit extensions) but it's probably not out until around july or later the sequence 8 chips were just released (sequence 8, intel pentium d 8xx, their dual core) not only would i suggest 64-bit (either amd64 or em64t) but i'd also suggest dual cored 64-bit (so you have two em64t equipped prescott's, or a pair of amd64 equipped cores) so that you can run 64-bit applications, and multi-threaded applications (both of these are going to be a reality soon)  </s>
