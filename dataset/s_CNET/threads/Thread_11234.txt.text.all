<s> hi i still have the 40 gb hard drive that came with the dimension 2400, however i have upgraded ram to 1gb and video card to fx5200.  </s>
<s> i read around and there seem to be a lot of things to consider such as different types of hard disks and maybe i am short on power supply and that the dimension 2400 only has one power source for hard disk.  </s>
<s> there is a lot more than that as well it seems.  </s>

<s> a hard disk of around 100 gb would be great.  </s>
<s> thanks a lot in advance.  </s>
<s> google this: finds this on the first page: it notes 160gb drives so with dell's latest bios it seems you can support 160gb drives without further research.  </s>
<s> if you need another power connection, there are y connectors at the stores.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'd upgrade your bios to the most recent and check to see if it mentions lba 48 (48-bit logical block addressing)?  </s>
<s> if it supports that then you can get any drive you want.  </s>
<s> just buy one and hook it up as slave and see if your bios id's it as the correct size?  </s>
<s> if it does your off and running.  </s>
<s> if not buy this.  </s>
<s> you can also go with and ata pci card with lba-48 support .... the only problem is your power supply .... you may need to upgrade that and dell (unless they've changed) uses proprietary psu's so it could be tricky?  </s>
<s> cheers  </s>
