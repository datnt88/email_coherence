<s> hi, i'm in the market for a dvd+/- writer.  </s>
<s> given the newbie tag i've given myself, hopefully someone will heed my s.o.s  </s>
<s> for all my cd/cd-rw/dvd/dvd burners i have only gone with lite-on.  </s>
<s> very fast.  </s>
<s> reliable.  </s>
<s> however if you want an extremly silent computer, sometimes these can be a little noisy when loading extreme amounts of data.  </s>
<s> not too loud, because i can tolerate it.  </s>
<s> try this one and see if it is what you are looking for: tyler  </s>
<s> and i like it a lot.  </s>
<s> note i got a big discount from cirtcuit city by buying it thru their website and picking it up at their store-- buying it at the store was $40 more!  </s>
<s> - fj note you may need nero burning rom for some things but the bundled software works very well.  </s>
<s> nero is great.  </s>
<s> i most of the time find it cheapest online. the one that i previously linked includes the nero software and powerdvd.  </s>
<s> tyler  </s>
