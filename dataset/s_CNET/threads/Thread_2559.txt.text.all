<s> i want to buy a new computer and haven't a clue as to which brand i should consider, what processor, hard drive etc. i love to be on the internet, make and play my own cd's, maybe make and play dvd's.  </s>
<s> i do not play video games at all, just solitaire, free cell, scrabble etc. i have a great hp photosmart printer (new at christmas) an lg 19&quot; flat screen monitor (new july 4/06) very good speakers and sub woofer.  </s>
<s> i could use a new keyboard, but have a great mouse.  </s>
<s> all i need is all the rest and i don't know where to start.  </s>
<s> which desktop brand is a good one for now and in the future and which hardware should i consider?  </s>
<s> any help would be so very much appreciate as i know nothing about any of this stuff.  </s>
<s> please help me and thanks so much.  </s>
<s> i have a gateway media center, which has a dvd drive, cd drive, and can be setup for a tv. i bought mine at bestbuy.  </s>
<s> i knew nothing about computers but my son knew pretty much about them, so he went with.  </s>
<s> i needed the whole package, monitor,etc.  </s>
<s> if you know someone who can go with you and knows computers that would help.  </s>
<s> i suggest getting one with alot of memory, etc. and ask alot of questions from the salesperson.  </s>
<s> if they do not answer your questions or if they seem bothered by your questions, go someplace else. it also depends on how much your willing to spend.  </s>
<s> my computer alone was $1,100 without all the extras, (monitor,etc.) i liked my gateway so much that my family bought my other son a gateway for his birthday.  </s>
<s> all you really need is a server.  </s>
<s> acer has several available.  </s>
<s> they include the keyboard and mouse.  </s>
<s> tiger direct has some killer prices with a four-payment plan.  </s>
<s> get the high-end athlon cpu and 2 gigs.  </s>
<s> since you are not a gamer, you can probably live with on-board graphix.  </s>
<s> if your going to edit dvds - be sure to get a video capture card or outboard device.  </s>
<s> i have an acer and 4 dells.  </s>
<s> they are all good.  </s>
<s> you don't necessarily need a media center setup, but i would recommend wndows xp professional as an operating system.  </s>
<s> some of the manufacturers are already offering vista as an option but (trust me) it's way to early to be using that.  </s>
<s> good luck - carry on.  </s>
<s> thanks so much for your answer.  </s>
<s> i hear about people having hard drives that are really fast and have 120 gb. what exactly does this mean?  </s>
<s> how much ram and memory should i have.  </s>
<s> this amd that you are talking about is the processor right?  </s>
<s> 2 gb is fast?  </s>
<s> i apologize, but i really don't know anything about all of this stuff and i do want to know so badly.  </s>
<s> please tell me whatever else you think would be helpful to me.  </s>
<s> amd is faster and better than intel pentium 4 right?  </s>
<s> should i keep my cd and cdrw or get new ones?  </s>
<s> i have heard of acer, but don't really know about it.  </s>
<s> anyway, thanks again and if you have the time, please inform me with more information.  </s>
<s> thanks chuck4456  </s>
<s> thank you for your reply.  </s>
<s> i don't know anyone who has a gateway computer, but i sure do know the name.  </s>
<s> i was hoping i didn't have to spend $1,100.00 and more on a computer, but it looks like i will have to.  </s>
<s> i will go to best buy here and talk to someone and i have someone who will go with me who is very knowledgeable about computers.  </s>
<s> this way they won't give me nonsense about the computer, especially because i am a woman.  </s>
<s> thanks so much again and enjoy your computer.  </s>
<s> the fast hard drives are likely 7200 rpm or so and can access a lot of data quickly which i'd think would be common on most new systems.  </s>
<s> 120 gb indicates the size of the hard drive, that it has a capacity of 120 gigabytes or about 120,000 megabytes roughly.  </s>
<s> a 3 minute mp3 is about 3 megabytes just to give you an idea of how much room that is.  </s>
<s> as for ram, which stands for random access memory, i would think 1 gb should be fine unless you plan to upgrade to vista when it comes out next year in which case i would look for 1.5-2 gb of ram which is likely a bit of overkill for now.  </s>
<s> xp will likely run well on 512 mb of ram but for some things a little more memory may be useful.  </s>
<s> just to give you an example here my work computer has 1 gb of ram and my home laptop has 2 gb of ram and i work as a software developer.  </s>
<s> amd does have some good processors and may be a little cheaper than intel.  </s>
<s> i would likely suggest at this moment try to find an amd athlon 64 x2 to be a good but not stellar cpu as intel will have their new models coming out later this month and so you'll see things be cheaper then.  </s>
<s> the pentium 4 is somewhat of an older cpu as the new one coming out is the core 2 duo and the current top one among intel is the core duo for home desktops.  </s>
<s> if you wait then the pentium 4s will be cheaper though i would suggest looking at a core duo if you want something a bit newer. the amd one i mentioned above will likely have some 4 digit number after it that i would likely think anything in the 4000+ to 4800+ should be fine though the lower will likely be cheaper.  </s>
<s> does the cdrw make dvds?  </s>
<s> this is a whole other story to get into as there are more than a few different kinds of dvd burners and some have a feature called lightscribe to let your computer burn the name on the disc rather than having to use a marker.  </s>
<s> a few names that i'd consider good when looking at various computers would be acer, compaq, emachines, gateway, and hp. another idea would be to go on dell's site and look at all the options they give you and see if you can get through those options without too much difficulty.  </s>
<s> regards, jb  </s>
<s> wow, i am so impressed by all this information, how can i ever thank you.  </s>
<s> this is exactly the kind of stuff i wanted to read about.  </s>
<s> now i have some info to go on with.  </s>
<s> i printed your reply so i can look at computers and compare them with what you have written.  </s>
<s> thanks, thanks and thanks.  </s>
<s> very much appreciated.  </s>
<s> just for the record, my cdrw does not make dvd's, it is more than 3 years old now.  </s>

<s> luckylady  </s>
<s> chuck: you own an acer desktop pc? which model do you own?  </s>
<s> you also mentioned owning a few dell's.  </s>
<s> i submitted a post not too long ago in this forum which was are acer computers any good?  </s>
<s> are they as good as dell's?  </s>
<s> i didn't receive much feedback.  </s>
<s> so let me ask you; are acer desktop pc's any good and if so are they as good as or better than desktop pc's offered by dell?  </s>
<s> i did notice that most of the power supplies installed in the acer machines were rated at only 300 watts which i consider to be just minimum.  </s>
<s> another question which i also asked and got no feedback was if you bought a new acer pc; if you wanted to could you upgrade the power supply and if so; would you be able to find one that would fit?  </s>
<s> finally if you did upgrade the power supply in any new acer desktop pc would there be any problems with any of the other system's components by upgrading the pc's power supply?  </s>
<s> big steve biloxi, mississippi 07/06/06  </s>
<s> ...to questions that you have asked.  </s>
<s> 1) having a bigger hard drive means that you will be able to store more pictures, songs, movies, etc. when you install a program on your computer, all the information gets saved on the hard drive.  </s>
<s> when you save something onto your hard drive, it stays there when you turn the computer off.  </s>
<s> the information stays on the hard drive forever, unless you choose to delete it.  </s>
<s> hard drive capacity is measured in gigabytes (ie: 80gb, 250gb, etc.) the more gigabytes, the more stuff you'll be able to store on your computer.  </s>
<s> 160gb is a good balance between size and price, but they make hard drives up to 750gb.  </s>
<s> 2) ram (random access memory) is temporary memory.  </s>
<s> when you turn off your computer, all the information in the ram gets erased. the more ram that you have, the more programs you'll be able to run at once without the computer slowing down.  </s>
<s> ram is also measured in gigabytes; a typical amount of ram is 1gb.  </s>
<s> 3) the cpu (central processing unit) is like the brain of your computer; it does all the thinking.  </s>
<s> athlon 64s are indeed faster than pentium 4s, and athlon 64s also use less power and produce less heat.  </s>
<s> about a year ago, amd and intel introduced dual-core processors.  </s>
<s> dual-core means that there are two processor cores on the same chip.  </s>
<s> dual-core processors are good for multitasking (running many programs at once) because the processors can process data simeltaneouly.  </s>
<s> the amd dual-core processor is called the athlon 64 x2. the intel dual-core is called the pentium d. athlon 64 x2s are faster than pentium ds, and they also produce less heat and use less power.  </s>
<s> however, on july 14, intel will release their new dual-core processor, the core 2 duo.  </s>
<s> from what i've seen so far, the core 2 duo runs faster, produces less heat, and uses less power than the athlon 64 x2, so it makes sense to wait about 2 weeks until dell offers the core 2 duo.  </s>
<s> i hope that this post has helped you to better understand how a computer works, and has eased your purchase decision.  </s>
<s> nathanpsz2: could you address my question to another poster about acer desktop computers and changing out the factory installed ps's in acer desktop computers?  </s>
<s> do you know anything about or have you had any experience in using acer desktop computers?  </s>
<s> big steve biloxi, mississippi 07/07/06  </s>
<s> how much moola do you have to work with?  </s>
<s> that is the deciding factor in what's best for your buck.  </s>
<s> however, here are some links to systems that would be enough for your needs now and into the future: these are just a few of what would probably be great for your usage.  </s>
<s> stay away from emachines and any systems with an intel celeron cpu.  </s>
<s> get no less than a 3800+ amd or 3.0g intel cpu, no less than 1.0g ram, preferably a sata harddrive and a dvd=/-rrw/cdrw.  </s>
<s> do not upgrade to the new windows vista. the basic vista will be less functional than xp.  </s>
<s> this should be possible, as long as the case is the standard atx design.  </s>
<s> if it's a proprietary design, the new psu might not even fit in the case.  </s>
<s> also, the motherboard might require the original psu. it doesn't seem like a good idea to me; you might end up frying the motherboard and other components.  </s>
<s> thank you very much for your very helpful advice.  </s>
<s> i will heed your advice and still with windows xp. i like it anyway.  </s>
<s> i appreciate you taking the time to write this message, thanks again.  </s>
<s> luckylady  </s>

<s> without being anything other than a novice, i went to best buy to see about replacing my old compaq.  </s>
<s> at that time (2002) you could buy a compaq cpu (central processing unit or &quot;tower&quot;) with keyboard and mouse for $379.  </s>
<s> it had a pentium 4, 1.9 gb chip & 512 mb of ram, a cd reader/writer-cd-rom. i haven't seen anything like this at best buy since but i'm sure that you can order only what you need at tigerdirect ( you have a super monitor--no need to replace that.  </s>
<s> you can buy a dvd player-cd writer/reader for about $30 (lite-on).  </s>
<s> maybe more sophisticated computer types will quibble but i don't think you need a dual-core chip, and as one of the previous writers said, pentium 4 will drop in price.  </s>
<s> you should be able to pick-up a bargain!  </s>
<s> hard-drives are all generally 7200 rpm these days.  </s>
<s> size is indicated by the capacity in gigabites.  </s>
<s> 120 gb should be plenty.  </s>
<s> if it turns out to be too small, bigger ones are cheap.  </s>
<s> all brands of hd's will fail eventually, and you should be prepared.  </s>
<s> my compaq came with a 40 gb hd which failed after 11 months.  </s>
<s> compaq replaced it under warranty.  </s>
<s> i just saw a cordless ge keyboard & mouse on sale for $39.95.  </s>
<s> why not go cordless?  </s>
<s> surely there is someone who can go through the tigerdirect website with you and help you over the rough spots!  </s>
<s> good luck!! l'il abner  </s>
<s> your advice about changing out the ps on a brand new acer desktop pc is well taken.  </s>
<s> the only reason i asked was i had read on this board and other sources that a 300 watt ps was considered these days to be a low rated ps. i was forced to replace the ps in my old win 95 desktop pc last year before hurricane katrina paid my town a visit.  </s>
<s> i took my pc to a local computer repair shop located right on the beach and the owner was able to fix it. the owner installed some private label ps which was rated at 450 watts and my computer is almost 9 years old and yet manufacturers are installing only 300 watt ps's now in brand new desktop pc's?  </s>
<s> unfortunately hurricane katrina blew away that guy's computer store; he decided to move on rather than stay and rebuild.  </s>
<s> i just thought a 300 watt ps was kind of wimpy when i read about gamers having ps's rated from 500 watts and more in their gaming machines.  </s>
<s> let me ask you this; if someone asked you which brand of desktop pc would you consider to have more bang for the buck, which of these two brands would you recommend?  </s>
<s> would you recommend buying from acer or buying from dell?  </s>
<s> i'd be using the computer for word processing; email; web surfing and some quicken; that's all.  </s>
<s> i'm from an older generation apparently because when i asked a guy at acer recently if any of their desktop pc's came pre-configured with a floppy drive; he said no and then asked why i wanted a floppy drive when there are other ways to back up computer data?  </s>

<s> the guy at acer said something about a flash drive.  </s>
<s> what's a flash drive?  </s>
<s> you can order most dell desktops with a floppy drive.  </s>
<s> a flash drive is basically a removable drive that plugs into a usb port.  </s>
<s> they use non-volatile flash memory, and range in size from 32 megabytes to several gigabytes.  </s>
<s> you can get a 1 gigabyte flash drive for about $20 from newegg.com.  </s>
<s> flash drives have all but replaced floppy disks; floppies hold 1.44 megabytes.  </s>
<s> if u are getting a new pc then make sure dat u got a p4 or a dual proceesor with 915 chipset you need at least a 945 chipset to use a pentium d. besides, athlon 64 x2s are much better than pentium ds, and the core 2 duo, which will kill all the pentium ds and athlon 64 x2's, is about to come out.  </s>
<s> nathan: first of all; thanks for the post.  </s>
<s> so you're sold on dell.  </s>
<s> well here's my next question.  </s>
<s> if you had a choice and you could; would you order a new dell desktop pc from dell's home office division or dell's small business division?  </s>
<s> someone told me to order from dell's small business division because if i did i'd have access to usa tech support where as if i ordered from dell's home office division i'd receive tech support from india or the phillipines.  </s>
<s> i was looking at dell's xps 400 desktop but do you think that model would be overkill for someone like myself who needs a new desktop pc simply for doing word processing; email; web surfing; and some quicken?  </s>
<s> if the xps 400 is overkill; would something like dell's dimension 3100 or 5100 be more appropriate?  </s>
<s> any idea what size ps's are in those dell machines without having to call dell?  </s>
<s> about you recommending to configure a back up recovery cd for the computer's os; dell also offers something by symantec or norton i think; if i choose to configure a new desktop pc with windows xp home; would the recovery disk for windows xp home be the right choice to select instead of the norton recovery cd? what's the difference?  </s>
<s> about that matter concerning the floppy drive; dell offers a choice of either an internal floppy or an internal 13 card media reader with a choice of also an external floppy drive.  </s>
<s> would you choose to configure the pc with the card reader then later purchase an internal floppy drive from someone like new egg to be installed later or would that cause problems with my dell warranty?  </s>
<s> about those extended warranties; do you believe in purchasing one and if so; for how long? for 1 extra year; 2 extra years; or 3? i'm not even considering the 4 year warranty because of the cost.  </s>
<s> about configuring optical drives; i've been told that 2 drive bays are better than 1. a dvd rom in drive bay #1 and a cdrw/dvdrw in drive bay #2. what's your thoughts on that?  </s>

<s> i'd choose the windows xp reinstallation cd because that is a clean install of windows without all the crap software.  </s>
<s> the difference between the windows reinstallation cd and the norton recovery cd is that the norton cd will probably try to repair the operating system by installing all programs that originally came installed on the computer.  </s>

<s> big steve biloxi, mississippi 07/10/06  </s>
<s> why not go down to your local pc store and have a look at their pre-made systems.  </s>

<s> i read in another forum on a different website last night that dell plans to offer very soon another line of desktop pc's with amd processors.  </s>
<s> what's your opinion on that?  </s>
<s> i think that it's interesting that dell is looking into amd processors just as intel is about to release their new cpu which is looking to outperform amd processors.  </s>
<s> this would be a huge break for amd, as dell is the largest maker of pcs in the world, and they sell hundreds of millions of pcs each year.  </s>
<s> are intel processors still considered to be better than amd's?  </s>
<s> as of today, amd processors are better than intel processors. the amd athlon 64 (single core) and athlon 64 x2 (dual-core) perform better than the intel pentium 4 (single core) and pentium d (dual-core). the amd processors also use less power and produce less heat.  </s>
<s> however, intel will soon release their next-generation cpu, the core 2 duo, which, from the benchmarks that i've seen, outperforms amd cpus, and uses less power.  </s>
<s> the core 2 duo is supposed to be released on july 14, and dell should have them in stock soon after they're released.  </s>
<s> i'd definately wait for a couple weeks before making a purchase.  </s>
<s> nathan: again thanks for the post.  </s>
<s> these new intel processors which are due to come out on july 14th with dell; will they be considerably more expensive than the current intel processors offered by dell?  </s>

<s> again thanks for the post.  </s>
<s> these new intel processors which are due to come out on july 14th with dell; will they be considerably more expensive than the current intel processors offered by dell? the core 2 duo is priced about the same as the pentium 4/d. the core 2 duo is a dual-core cpu (hence the name &quot;duo&quot;), and the cheapest one, the e6300, will be more than enough for what you're using it for.  </s>
<s> because the cpus are priced the same, the overall price of the computer will probbaly stay the same, or go up a little bit.  </s>

<s> no; the e6300 is the cheapest model in the core 2 duo range.  </s>
<s> despite being the cheapest, it is very fast, and it will do everything you need it to do with ease.  </s>
<s> i think that, from your question, a mac mini would be great for you.  </s>
<s> a mac mini comes with ilife, which contains video editing and dvd creation tools, as well as itunes, which you may already be familier with.  </s>
<s> as a bonus, it is small and quiet your printer should work, check with the manufacturer.  </s>
<s> if your monitor has digital inputs, make sure you have a dvi cable.  </s>

<s> luckylady_63, some other considerations in buying a new pc are: [1] how long do you plan to keep this new pc? the more 'cutting' edge pc you buy the longer for it to go obsolete.  </s>
<s> also the longer you plan to keep this new pc; then, the more you need to consider length of warranty, technical support, upgradability, etc. [i have an 8yr old gateway pc, that only the case & floppy drive are original equipment; everything else has been replaced via repair or upgrade.]  </s>
<s> [2] what type of technical support do you want?  </s>
<s> your friend and/or local and/or online professional?  </s>
<s> [3] how upgradable is the pc you plan to buy?  </s>
<s> inlcuding how many open 'slots' [of what kind pci or pci express or pci express x16 for new graphic card - graphics being one of the technologies changing the fastest.]  </s>
<s> how many open [unused] 5.25 & 3.5 drive bays [internal & external note: externals are accessable from the outside] which not only can support additional hard drives; but, things like additional dvd, cd, multi-card reader, etc.] how many unused eide & sata connections are there for hard drives, dvd, cd, etc. this could include moving your existing hard drive as a secondary [slave] in your new pc.  </s>
<s> how many ram slots are there and how many are used?  </s>
<s> [4] is the pc vista compatable?  </s>
<s> in case you want to upgrade later to vista [e.g. vista requires a dvd drive, should have 1gb - preferable 2gbs of ram, a 64mb - preferably 128mb or better yet 256mb graphics card note: the new ati graphic cards have capability to reformat graphic formats, e.g. reformat your ipod music video so it will play on your pc or burn to cd or dvd.  </s>
<s> [5] recommend that your ram be divided evenly into two 'sticks' [e.g. 1gb ram in 2x512mbs 'sticks'.];  </s>
<s> since, most newer processors [amd or intel] have some kind of dual processing [or 'threading'] capability that works best if each has a seperate 'stick' of ram associated with it.  </s>
<s> [6] what type of sound 'card' do you want?  </s>
<s> on-board [i.e. embeded in the mother board (mobo)] or seperate pci or pci express card?  </s>
<s> creative labs [sound blaster, audigy, x-fi, etc.] is considered the industry standard for sound, and i personnally prefer seperate sound card [i have audigy ii 24-bit cards in my 3 pcs].  </s>
<s> also make sure that the sound 'card' has at least a 5.1 speaker connectors [also some have 7.1 or better].  </s>
<s> what type of speakers do you have?  </s>
<s> with subwoofer?  </s>
<s> note: 5.1 stands for a center plus left & right stereo front speakers plus left & right rear surround sound speakers = '5' plus a subwoofer [i.e. the '.1'] if you don't already have a subwoofer, i would add one; since, this gives the biggest improvement in sound after stereo spreakers, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> [7] does the pc have convience of 'front panel' connectors for usb-2.0, firewire, sound [head phones, microphone, other inputs?]  </s>
<s> my creative audigy ii platnium sound cards have a module in one of my front panel extenal 5.25 drive bays with varius sound card connections.  </s>
<s> [8] what peripherals do you have [or plan to add] to your new pc and what type of connectors do they utilize [e.g. parallel, serial, usb, firewire, etc.] how many connectors does the pc have?  </s>
<s> parallel & serial ports are manily used for older peripherals [e.g. printers, scanners, cameras, etc.] before usb & firewire [ieee] became available.  </s>
<s> usb-2.0 is now usually the prefered connector [i would not buy a pc that had older usb-1.1 connectors].  </s>
<s> firewire is used for many digital cameras and some external hard drives.  </s>
<s> how many of these ports are in the front and how many in the back?  </s>
<s> many pcs now come with 4 to 6 usb-2.0 in the back and 2 in the front, as an example.  </s>
<s> [9] relative to dvd drive, i would opt for one that has all four +/- dvd r/rw formats [also lg makes one with a fifth format as well as these four in it - dvd-ram].  </s>
<s> also all dvd +/- r/rw drives have cd-r/rw capability as well.  </s>
<s> some higher end pcs will come with a combo [dvd-rom + cd-r/rw] drive & dvd+/-r/rw drive; so, you can read from one drive & write to the other.  </s>
<s> also you mentioned that you currently have a cd-r/rw drive.  </s>
<s> what speed is it?  </s>
<s> depending on how old your existing cd-r/rw drive is, you may find the current drives are significantly faster [e.g. 48x or 52x read speeds as an example.];  </s>
<s> so, may want to get new drive anyway for it's faster speed.  </s>
<s> you may also see reference to 'dual-layer' capability, this means the drive can read & write to two layers on a cd or dvd [e.g. for writing (burning/ripping) this takes special disks mfg for dual write capability - that are of course more expensive than 'single' layer disks.]  </s>
<s> [10] finally, do you have a surge protector or ups [uninterupted power supply] or 'smart' ups [e.g. an ups that communicates with pc, usually via usb cable, that will automatically save your data & shut down your pc in prolonged power outage.]  </s>
<s> note: surge protector only takes the 'spikes'/'surges' out of incoming power.  </s>
<s> most ups will also increase low power [e.g. 'brown-outs'] to even the flow of power to your pc and protect the various 'chips' in it.  </s>
<s> i personnaly have apc smart ups on my pcs and surge protectors on my phone lines [to all my phones as well the one connected to the pc] my satellite cable connection and all my tv & stereo equipment.  </s>
<s> also please note that power surges follow least resistant path to ground; and telephone, cable, dsl & satellite lines are all susceptable!  </s>
<s> so anything connected/'wired' to your pc can carry an unwanted surge [e.g. if monitor, speakers and/or printer, or other peripherals are plugged into wall or phone line, etc. and not into a surge protector/ups first; then they can carry a surge to your pc via its connecting [e.g. usb?] cable; even if the pc itself is protected.  </s>

<s> over the years, i've stuck to buying several of the major brands: ibm (now lenovo, gateway, hp, emachines, apple, and dell.  </s>
<s> some of the reasons for my choices are, of course, the stability of these firms and the warranties.  </s>
<s> i'm sure there are some off brands which are just as good or even better, however, always check them out to find out if they are reputable and if they will provide warranties and tech services that are reliable.  </s>
<s> you may wish to wait a while for microsoft's latest os vista to hit the market.  </s>
<s> at this point, it makes little sense to buy into winxp as this will eventually be phased out.  </s>
<s> my first choice would be an amd dual core processor followed by an intel dual core.  </s>
<s> right now, based on benchmark tests, amd holds an edge over intel, but this may change in the near term so pay attention to their latest product offerings.  </s>
<s> check out the major magzines mentioned as they do the benchmark tests.  </s>
<s> i believe that you are probably going to want a computer in the midlevel range, probably around $1,000 or above.  </s>
<s> most computers in this price range meet your requirements.  </s>
<s> i've seen some excellent buys at costco, and every now and then, they have coupon specials, and costco's online website will offer dell with some decent specials with discounts.  </s>
<s> costco will take back computers, even after six months of usage, so this is one the better reasons i buy from costco.  </s>
<s> if price is a major concern, costco also offers refurbished computers, and you may pick up one of these at a price you can afford.  </s>
<s> you will also get some good buys either at bestbuy or circuit city.  </s>
<s> cc's website has buyer reviews and ratings which are very helpful.  </s>
<s> they all carry the major brands, and many times, they can beat costco on price.  </s>
<s> so, when you zero in on a particular computer, just check which one has the better price, if that is a major concern.  </s>

<s> check out if that is not an option then for what you are wanting to do you really don't need anything special at all.  </s>
<s> you already have the monitor, so if you could find a low end computer that has a dvd/cd burner on it then thats all you need. as far as the processor and hard drive goes i'd say a pentium 4 and maybe an 80gb hard drive so nothing fancy.  </s>
<s> these guys that are saying go with a dual core processor, i wouldn't go for it.  </s>
<s> thats way overkill for what you are wanting to use the computer for.  </s>
<s> very nice for the price, amd sempron 1.8ghz, 100gb hard drive, cd-rw/dvd-rom optical drive, ati radeon xpress 200 on board graphics, windows xp home edition with service pack 2, 512mb ddr sdram.  </s>
<s> i usualy hate buying retail computers (i just build my own for half the price) but that is a great deal for what its got in it.  </s>
<s> the e310 is very basic, and it will fulfill most of your needs if you're not a gamer.  </s>
<s> you can get this model with 3 different intel pentium 4 microprcessors, so the prices may vary.  </s>
<s> right now, if you were to check out the cost.com  </s>
<s> website, you would be able to buy a higher end e510 for almost the same price as the xps400.  </s>
<s> either one of these two are exceptional, and go way beyond what you may be looking for, however, both offer the intel dual-core microprocessors which i have on my gateway.  </s>
<s> i can attest to the fact that you can do multiple tasks with the dual core, especially if you edit video which i do.  </s>
<s> also, i have a tv card, and i can watch tv without having to run into the living room.  </s>
<s> i can also record live tv on my hard drive with the ms media center.  </s>
<s> one important consideration is an upgrade at some future point.  </s>
<s> i know that i can upgrade my microprocessor, and eventually, i may decide to do this.  </s>
<s> this is important as you may wish to forestall the buying of an entirely new computer at some point down the line.  </s>
<s> i see where the e310 has won two awards from major magazines which means that they've checked it out, and they consider it a highly recommended buy.  </s>
<s> if it meets all of your reqirements, then you may save yourself a bundle as opposed to the other two higher end models.  </s>
<s> i hope this will be of help to you.  </s>
<s> thanks so much for your valued suggestions in my quest for a new computer.  </s>

<s> your needs seem pretty simple, and retail desktops have really dropped in price.  </s>

<s> same for sound- onboard sound has come a long way, and you'd be surprised at the quality you get nowadays.  </s>
<s> so as far as hardware, that pretty much leaves the hardrive- depending on the model, you're bound to get a hardrive at least 100 gig or more.  </s>
<s> that leave a burner; most retail sellers will include a dual layer burner.  </s>
<s> no matter what brand you buy, i'd suggest getting a pc (assuming you're getting a pc- sounds like a mini-mac would suit your needs also) with a 64 bit chip so you wont get left behind when 64 bit applications become more available.  </s>
<s> you should be able to get a pc in the $500 or less range that should suit your needs.  </s>
<s> i don't often see gateway desktops, but e-machines are cheap and pretty reliable; i believe e-machines was purchased by gateway; however, i don't think you'll get the same quality tech support as you would with a gateway- i know this only from what i've read, not from personal experience.  </s>
<s> my brother in law bought an hp with an amd 64 bit chip for less than $600 (which included a 19&quot; lcd monitor) more than a year ago, and he's very happy with it. it normally retailed for well over $1200, but he bought it when there was some kind of super sale at circuitcity.  </s>
<s> that particular model may have been discontinued, but i still peruse the sunday flyers just to look, and there's always sales.  </s>
<s> he's very happy with their tech support, and recently, when he was having trouble with the dual-layer burner, tech support troubleshot the problem with him and it was determined that he needed a new one which was sent to him in 2 days.  </s>
<s> i have an hp laptop, and can definitely say their tech support is top notch.  </s>
<s> luckily, i haven't had to have any hardware replaced.  </s>
<s> one last thing: don't buy a dell.  </s>
<s> since you already have the monitor, i see no reason why you shouldn't be able to get a desktop with a 64 bit chip, a gig of ram, and a hardrive at least 100 gigs big.  </s>

<s> re: dell.  </s>
<s> unless you buy a business class system and require tech support (which i suspect the original poster will probably need), you'll be speaking to someone with an accent so thick, you wont understand a single word.  </s>
<s> dell uses cheap parts, and has a proprietary power-supply/motherboard setup- meaning, you can't just go out and replace a dell power supply unit without the risk of literally setting your system on fire.  </s>
<s> a business class system would put the price tag way over the top for the needs of the original poster (but you'd get better tech support).  </s>
<s> yes, dell makes very cheap systems, something that would well suit the poster's needs, however, what i've said about the tech support, which has been stated numerous times by others on these boards make me rule them out entirely.  </s>
<s> also, as my friends' personal tech support person, i see a high rate of hardware failure.  </s>
<s> dell stock has just dropped recently, in part (according to the article i read in the business section of my local paper) due to lousy tech support, competitive pricing by hp/compaq, and the series of laptops (don't recall which one) that has a habit of going up in flames due to some type of manufacturing defect.  </s>
<s> though dell still seems to have the market share of retail computers, this doesn't mean they put out a quality product.  </s>
<s> i know some people that are quite happy with their (expensive, business class) dells.  </s>
<s> they've paid extra for the 24/7 tech support and in-home repair.  </s>
<s> somthing you can get for free from the 1 year warranty hp provides.  </s>
<s> as a build it your selfer, i did some research and found out what parts dell used in a relatively cheap system they advertised a few years ago when my daughter needed a new computer.  </s>
<s> i built it for about $400 using similiar parts, but was able to use a faster cpu, and saved about $800.  </s>
<s> i don't require tech support for my desktops, but do for my laptops, so, again, i can vouch for hp/compaq and gateway' tech support.  </s>
<s> we use dells at my job, ant the it people hate dells.  </s>
<s> they spend most of their time replacing 1 piece of hardware or another.  </s>
<s> as for monarch, i can only comment on what i've heard- i have a long time friend on these boards who had a monarch system built, and she's quite happy with her system, and her experience with dealing with monarch's sales people.  </s>
<s> i've read from other posters that they're quite happy with their monarch systems also.  </s>
<s> i can't say as to their tech support, as the people i know who have monarchs don't require it, but the consensus seems to be that monarch is a solid company.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>
<s> all the major vendors (hp/compaq, dell, gateway, emachines, sony, etc.) are proprietary.  </s>
<s> none of them are &quot;easy&quot; to work with...they &quot;all&quot; have limitations to what you can configure (especially in the bios where it is critical to how a system runs)..........emachines have crappy power supplies and alot of times allow for no upgrading..stay completely away from that junk even if they want to pay you to take one....it's not worth the price of painkillers............................all the major companies have the hardware components made to their specs................it's not that they are &quot;cheap&quot;, the components may run on different voltages/etc.  </s>
<s> than a normal consumer isn't trained to work with.......the big companies use discontinued/outdated components mixed with the latest and greatest..............the &quot;slowest&quot; piece of hardware in your system determines the systems &quot;top&quot; speed/efficiency/performance...............it doesn't do any good to have a 3.8g cpu, a 160g 8mb cache hdd with &quot;512mb of pc2100 ram&quot;....................the memory kills a system like this because it is way too slow........the same setup only the memory is pc2700 or higher, the same 3.8g cpu &quot;only&quot; the hdd is a 160g &quot;2mb&quot; cache..........there's another slowdown.....this is why it's very important to know how the components work together for best performance................it's not unusual for the manufacturers to slip a &quot;5400&quot; rpm hdd in.......that went out in desktops in the &quot;90's&quot;!!!!!!!!!.........it's impossible to purchase a decent enough machine for now and the near future for less than $500.00 unless there's one h**l of a sale somewhere...................most of the manufacturers don't put a big enough power supply in to withstand many upgrades.....sometimes there are not enough slots or the right kind............dells are fine if you buy business and stay business..........hp/compaq are okay but somewhat quirky.......gateway has been producing some really fine machines the past couple of years......as for monarch, systemax and others.............they aren't much different a lot of times...we've had hundreds and hundreds of these and other brands come in/out of the shop and you can't beat a custom built pc.....however, finding a competent builder is usually very tough......................and you &quot;can't&quot; build a better machine for the money than what's on the shelf generally........stop and think.........windows xp is ~ $150.00 by itself...what can you build for $350.00 that can compete unless &quot;you&quot; use really &quot;cheap&quot; parts?????????????????????????????????? it's tough to do............wholesale prices aren't that cheap.....warranty isn't lengthy either if you don't purchase &quot;retail&quot; parts...........tech support; good luck anywhere...........  </s>

<s> plextor dual layer burner bought on sale for $75. the chip is a p4 3.06 w/ht, cost about $199. the most expensive part was the 6800 vid card i bought, about $400, but i bought that later.  </s>

<s> if you go to a configurator, when you're done, don't be surprised you may be spending thousands of dollars. the bottom line with any hardware- there's no guarantees.  </s>
<s> the top of the line can fail on you right out of the box, a cheapie can last for years.  </s>
<s> that's why for the most part, i buy my parts from a local pc shop, where, if the piece of hardware fails within the store's warranty period, i just bring it back to them and let them worry about it (i'm just lazy).  </s>
<s> my 6800 vid card that cost me a little over $400 tanked on me in about 8 months time- cuz i'm such a lazy-a** i still haven't sent it back to leadtek, who responded very quickly to my email.  </s>

<s> are you interested in making your pc a &quot;tivo&quot;?  </s>

<s> not interested in that, then forget it, and move on.  </s>

<s> brandon: thanks for the very detailed post.  </s>
<s> basically i need a new desktop pc which i would use to do word processing; web surfing; email; and quicken financial.  </s>
<s> i'm not into gaming; i don't plan to make any videos or do any digital photography but would like to one day buy myself a digital camera except i can't seem to make up my mind on which digital camera to buy.  </s>
<s> i would like a full sized camera; something like my old minolta freedom zoom 90 which died on me earlier this year after 15 years of dependable service.  </s>
<s> i did post a question in the digital camera forum but got more confused by all the recommendations which i received so i've put off buying a digital camera for now.  </s>
<s> my focus now is on purchasing a new desktop pc. i wish i knew how to build a new computer but unfortunately i don't but i do know some things that i would want my new desktop pc to have.  </s>
<s> can't decide between an intel or athlon processor and which speed of processor i should select.  </s>
<s> can't decide between single core or dual core.  </s>
<s> i've decided on windows xp home w/sp2 as my os. i've also been told to get a recovery cd for the os. a hard drive size of anywhere from 80gb to 160gb.  </s>
<s> computer memory of at least 512mb to no more than 1gb.  </s>
<s> i've read that 2 optical drive bays are better than one so i'm considering a dvd rom in drive bay #1 and a dvd burner in drive bay #2. does it matter in which order you have the drive bays?can you have the burner in bay #1 and the reader in bay #2 or should the reader be in the first bay and the burner in the second bay?  </s>
<s> i guess i could get by with integrated video and audio motherboard; i don't have a clue on this item.  </s>
<s> although considered to be outdated by many i still want a floppy drive installed.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure about a media card reader or not.  </s>
<s> i would like a 56k dial-up modem installed.  </s>
<s> i also want whatever needs to be installed for high speed internet such as dsl or cable modem.  </s>
<s> as far as a power supply; i've read that i should go with nothing less than 400 watts; which brand to go with; i don't have a clue. the number of fans that the case should have and the size of the fans; again i don't have a clue.  </s>
<s> i'd like connections on the front of the computer case to plug in a digital camera rather than to plug it in on the back of the computer case.  </s>

<s> sorry for the rushed reply, and i'm doing so again (want to hit the pool with the kids,lol).  </s>
<s> ok, 2 questions: 1. what's your budget, and 2. have you made up your mind that you definitely want to build your own.  </s>
<s> your budget is a big determining factor whether you build yourself or buy retail of course.  </s>
<s> if you're bent on building yourself, and this may be the best bit of advice i can give you, do you have a knowledgable friend who can help you out?  </s>
<s> i say this because most computer parts are made in asia, and the translation leaves much to be desired.  </s>
<s> this is where the tech-knowledgeable friend comes in.  </s>
<s> even though i've built quite a few systems in the last few years, every motherboard will have something unrecognizable to me- to some, it's a piece of cake.  </s>
<s> i'm prety near-sighted, and i'm getting tired of holding a mini-flashlight in my mouth to read what's on the motherboard (you'd think by now i'd map everything out before i put the motherboard in-duh).  </s>
<s> still, for a first build, it would be helpful to have a knowledgable friend when you get to the &quot;wtf!&quot; point to help you out.  </s>
<s> that said, your needs seem to be as simple as the original poster's.  </s>
<s> not a gamer, so no vid card.  </s>
<s> i personally think onboard sound has gotten very good, so no sound card.  </s>
<s> i personally like a floppy drive myself; no biggie in cost, should be less than $15. i would suggest a 64 bit chip, preferably an amd (don't think intel has 64 bit for the home consumer anyway)- don't judge a processors speed from it's advertised speed- amd has it's memory controller built into the chip, so, say it's raw ghz is 1.6- that doesn't tell the whole story; you have to factor in the bus speed.  </s>
<s> my hp laptop has an 64 bit amd turion chip, raw chip speed 1.6- but it has a 1600 mhz bus speed.  </s>
<s> compare that to my current desktop- intel p4 3.06 ghz- bus speed 400 mhz.  </s>
<s> my point is, don't go by raw numbers you see.  </s>
<s> i may be inviting debate with the intel vs. amd crowd, but you can't argue with benchmarks- but for your needs, i really don't see a need for you to get the fastest chip on the block, but i do recommend a 64 bit chip, so you're &quot;future proofing&quot;.  </s>
<s> vendors will be coming out with 64 bit applications, so you'll want a chip to handle those application.  </s>
<s> my understanding thus far, is that vendors will make these apps backwords compatible, but if you're buying/building new, why not prevent any possible future headaches?  </s>
<s> as to single or dual core, i think it's moot as to your needs; for what you do, you probably wouldn't notice the difference.  </s>
<s> i'd say dual core if you were a gamer, runinng resource intensive applications, doing vid editing and the like, but you're not, so why spend the extra cash?  </s>
<s> no need to, imo. then there's motherboards that have the ram run in what's called dual-channel- speeds things up, but that means more expensive- for your needs, i don't see the need for it.  </s>
<s> if you buy a retail version of xp, you wont need a recovery cd; if you buy a retail pc, it should come with one.  </s>
<s> hd's are cheap; go to and i bet you can find a 250 gig hd for well under $100.  </s>
<s> a dvd burner will play dvd's, so you can get by on one optical drive (i'm thinking of cutting costs here); if you insist on 2 drives (i have 2 dvd burners on my system- 1. because i have lots of left over hardware from previous builds, and 2. it makes things simpler if i want to make disc to disc copies.  </s>
<s> but, overall no biggie as to 1 or 2. for the most part, it doesn't matter which drive goes in which bay; one drive will be a master (depending on if you have it on the secondary channel) and the other will be the slave. the master/slave relationship will be determined by how you set the &quot;jumpers&quot; on the drives itself.  </s>
<s> if you have only 1 hardrive, you may want to &quot;slave&quot; 1 drive to the same ribbon the hd is on, and put the 2nd hd on the secondary channel as the master.  </s>
<s> generally, i put the cheaper of my drives as the master- but quite frankly, i don't see much of a difference.  </s>
<s> either drive will read whatever disc you put in; you can always change the master/slave relationship either via the bios or changing the jumper settings.  </s>
<s> if i had only 1 hardrive, i would slave the &quot;d&quot; drive to the hd, then put the other drive on it's own ribbon.  </s>
<s> but, again, with 2 optical drives, no biggie as to which drives goe where as far as bays.  </s>
<s> antec makes good power supplies, and i agree that 400 watts should be the bare minimum (dell normally uses 250).  </s>
<s> i use a no-name psu called powermaster or something like that, 550 watts.  </s>
<s> been using powermaster for years, and only 1 psu failed on me.  </s>
<s> most motherboards these days will have integrated sound, video, phone jack, and ethernet connections for high-speed cable/dsl.  </s>
<s> personally, i don't like integrated card readers, unless you have many types of memory cards, cuz, when you open up my computer, you're gonna see about 6 extra drive letters and get a headache.  </s>
<s> just my personal bias.  </s>
<s> most cases now will have ports for front usb, and firewire connections.  </s>
<s> i have to run for now, but take a look at someplace like tigerdirect.com or newegg.com and take a look at their &quot;barebones&quot; systems.  </s>
<s> these are partially assembled pcs with the motherboard installed in the case, then you add the ram, drives, and os and you're good to go.  </s>
<s> i'll come back later to see if i missed anything....  </s>
<s> brandon: my budget is anywhere from $600.00 to no more than $1,000.00 and no i won't be building my own pc because i lack the technical expertise to do so.  </s>
<s> thanks for your post.  </s>
<s> big steve biloxi, mississippi 07/16/06  </s>
<s> seems that your needs are like lucky-lady's.  </s>
<s> i know many would recommend a local shop to custom make a system for you; many would say ''build your own!'' despite your saying you don't have the expertise to do so.  </s>
<s> for your needs, which are very basic, i'd suggest a retail system from someplace like bestbuy or circuitcity.  </s>
<s> i'd say up to $1000 is a very generous budget for your requirements.  </s>
<s> check out the circuitcity site for amd (my preference) 64 bit systems.  </s>
<s> the upside to a retail system is the whole system is warrantied (but do check exactly what is warrantied and for how long).  </s>
<s> you may think about getting an extended store warranty.  </s>
<s> i bought a sony camcorder from cc, and never had to bother with sony.  </s>
<s> never really had a problem, but the salesman suggested that i bring it in now and then ''for them to look it over; cuz they'll end up cleaning for you anyway''- was a good tip.  </s>
<s> anyway, check out what you get with the store warranty- ideally, should you run into hardware issues, you can simply let them do the work for you- meaning if the hd fails, they'll replace and reinstall it for you- but make sure you know and understand the terms of any extended agreement.  </s>
<s> here's just one example of a pretty decent system from cc made by hp: i'm not necessarily advocating this particular model, but just showing you one example of how cheap systems are, and this model suits all your needs (however, a quick read of the specs isn't clear to me whether there's 2 external bays for an extra optical drive).  </s>
<s> i just quickly looked at the amd based systems, picked an hp, a brand i know and like.  </s>
<s> spend a few bucks more, and i'm sure you'll find something that not only you will like, but more than suit your needs, and surely last you quite a few years.  </s>
<s> keep in mind the hp media center systems tend to come with not xp home or pro, but xp media os (or whatever they call the version geared towards multimedia).  </s>
<s> also, on many retail systems, there's a hidden partition that holds the installation files of the operating system.  </s>
<s> my brother in law asked hp to send him a disc with the installation files, and i helped him format the 200 gig hd to make use of the 30 gigs allocated for the hidden partition, and he ulitmately loaded xp pro.  </s>
<s> so ask the salesman that you don't want media edition of xp, but the home version of xp. even in retail stores things are nogotiable- it's just that people are afraid to ask.  </s>
<s> you've seen what i've said about hp's tech support, which i think is top notch.  </s>
<s> want something cheaper?  </s>
<s> check out the e-machines....but beware of the tech support, i hear it's lacking.  </s>
<s> not afraid to buy online?  </s>
<s> go to (vendor's name) website, and look for ''refurbished''. the it guys who don't like to build their own always buy refurbs.  </s>
<s> their reasoning is, there's actually more care in a refurb, because the whole system gets a good going over, as opposed to a something that rolled off the assembly line.  </s>
<s> just check online the retail stores like bestbuy, circuitcity, look for the same model #'s and comparison shop as to price.  </s>
<s> i'm no fan of my local bestbuy, but i know lots of people who love that store and their extended warranties- breaks, bring it in and they either repair or replace it.  </s>
<s> since i'm lazy, i prefer that method as opposed to possibly shipping the whole thing to who knows where.  </s>
<s> i bought the very first e-machine (500mhz chip!  </s>
<s> $500!), which served me very well, but when the floppy drive died, i had to ship it to california, who then shipped it to korea to replace the drive. the drive had a nice curve to it, so i couldn't just buy a cheap floppy and replace it.  </s>
<s> oh, speaking of floppies, since you want one, you may find it difficult to find a retail pc with a floppy drive.  </s>
<s> floppies are considered legacy devices more and more, so you may have to find a system that has a bay for a floppy drive you may have to install yourself.  </s>
<s> more and more, people are using usb ''flash'' drives instead of floppies.  </s>
<s> i still like floppy drives myself.  </s>
<s> as to tech support, there's no better place than these forums, but if you need it in the middle of the night, there's nothing like 24/7 tech support, so write down every question you may have should you head out to the nearest computer store.  </s>
<s> one upside to circuitcity, is the salespeople no longer work on commission, so there's no pressure by them, and i find the salespeople fairly knowledgable.  </s>
<s> just to muddy the waters a little, have you considered a laptop?  </s>
<s> it'll suit your every need, it's portable, and should the os go down the tubes, you generally need two discs to restore everything- the recovery disc to reinstall the os, and the drivers/applications disc for the hardware and applications.  </s>
<s> sometimes the applications disc will be seperate, so that's 3 discs.  </s>
<s> i bought my hp laptop for about $1200 when it first came out- has a burner, multi-format memory reader, 80 gig hd, it came loaded with 512 megs of ram, and i added an additional 512, has high-def screen, dual-layer burner that also plays dvds, a few applications.  </s>
<s> lately, i've been doing most of my computing laying on my back with the laptop propped up.  </s>
<s> just thought i'd toss that in there for you to think about.  </s>
<s> you should be able to buy the same model hp presario model v231ous for about $800 on sale these days- sorry make that a compaq.  </s>
<s> hp makes a similiar model.  </s>
<s> hp and compaq for all intents and purposes are the same, since they're the same company.  </s>
<s> has a dual layer burner, amd 64 bit turion chip. the turions were made for laptops- they don't get as hot, slightly slower than an a chip made for a desktop, but you can't beat it's portability, and the high-def screen is amazing.  </s>
<s> hope i've answered your questions.  </s>
<s> if so, happy hunting, and i hope this info helps lucklady, as well, since this is her thread.  </s>
<s> anymore questions, i, or someone else will be glad to answer them.  </s>
<s> brandon: first; thanks for another excellent post.  </s>
<s> to answer your question about using a laptop; my brother installed 2 new computers in the house where i'm living; our late father's home in march 2006.  </s>
<s> he bought and had installed 2 new computers from dell's small business division.  </s>
<s> one computer is a dell dimension 3000 or 3100; the other machine is a dell inspiron 1300 notebook which i've used quite a bit to post in this forum.  </s>
<s> i've never had the experience of using a notebook before until now and with dsl in the house replacing my old slow dial-up service; the dsl is very nice.  </s>
<s> a router has also been installed which allows me to use the notebook wirelessly throughout the house which too is very nice.  </s>
<s> i spoke to someone at dell's home office division last week about configuring a dell dimension e510 for me; the configuration price came in just under $900.00 but since that time i've read some feedback on cnet from users who have e510's and most said the dell e310 was a much better machine although it had limitations if you wanted to upgrade it so i can't decide on which dell pc to buy but i will check out that machine by hp who by the way make excellent printers.  </s>
<s> one final thing; if i bought an hp pc and needed a replacement part; is hp like dell; would i have to purchase my part or parts from hp? again thanks for your comments.  </s>
<s> big steve biloxi, mississippi 07/16/06  </s>
<s> another rushed response aws i'm off to work... i have to reply here, because your post has reached the max, and i can't reply from there.  </s>
<s> btw, the model i gave you for the laptop is for a compaq in case you look it up.  </s>
<s> hp has the exact same specs on some of their models.  </s>
<s> generally, for a laptop, when it comes to replacemant parts, i would go with the manufacturer's parts to avoid incompatibility. the upgradability of a laptop is very limited anyway.  </s>
<s> take a look at the specs on the compaq- it has everything you need, including a card reader (no floppy though).  </s>
<s> also, re: dell laptops- there was a recent recall on a line of dell laps because they had a nasty habit of catching fire.  </s>
<s> i've bought replacement part for laptops in the past from ebay w/out any problems, but they were from the same manufacturer.  </s>
<s> last thing about laptops- you may want to buy an extended warranty for the screen- there's normally a different warranty period for the screen.  </s>
<s> i bought from the store i got the compaq a special warranty where they'd replace it for any reason.  </s>
<s> gotta run, will check in this evening.  </s>
<s> how confused are you now??????????????? did you salvage anything useful to help you in your search for a new system?  </s>
<s> if you have further questions, please feel free to ask and i won't steer you wrong...............  </s>
<s> hi and thank you.  </s>
<s> yes i am very confused, so thanks for the invite to ask you or perhaps tell you what i am thinking of buying and we can go from there.  </s>
<s> i will get back to you shortly.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> email me....thanks  </s>
<s> dell has always been rated better than acer.  </s>
<s> i worked as a manger of a computer repair shop for a few years and acers were known for being very problematic, dells came in as well but were generally problems that were more easy to diagnose and repair.  </s>
<s> if i were you i would find an independent shop and talk to them about what you want the computer to do and specify each component.  </s>
<s> that way you can buy the best parts available on the market or the cheapest and have the say on each component.  </s>
<s> i have never owned a computer with a name on it and have had the best and fastest stuff money can buy.  </s>

<s> totally upgradeable, changeable with no proprietary crap to keep you from changing something if you want.i would at least look at this option.  </s>
<s> put the money where it is needed and save where it is not.  </s>
<s> but do buy a good quality brand motherboard like asus.  </s>
<s> that is all i ever use on hundreds of computers.  </s>
