(i buy from atlascopy.com) if you do a lot of color printing it's definitely worth doing. black cartridges are a lot easier to do-- i have refilled a black cartridge twice now, which has paid for the refill kit 4 times over. for simple text i find the inkjets have a certain amout of fuzziness on regular paper, also they are not waterproof, so for that i use hp laserprinters. for bulk printing i use an hp iiip, and a 1012 for faster fancier stuff. --fj
