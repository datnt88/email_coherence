<s> i have a kingston data traveler 4gb. the head snapped off. is there any way to recover the info on there?  </s>
<s> shows the usual picture of what's inside.  </s>
<s> we take that to the bench and solder on another cable or connector for that last time use to get the files out.  </s>
<s> also does this if you don't.  </s>

<s> i do not have the equipment but i will take it to a location that does.  </s>
<s> thanks for the info.  </s>
<s> i called drivesavers and they quoted $500-$1200 to repair.  </s>
<s> seems really high.  </s>
<s> they go beyond the simple repair i noted.  </s>
<s> they can even remove the flash memory chip and put it on another board.  </s>
<s> then if there is file system damage they can recover that too.  </s>
<s> when you can't lose it, they are to go to people. the highest price we paid was about 24,000 for recovering novell drives.  </s>
<s> long story about an it that believed that raid meant that backup was not necessary since raid could recover from drive loss.  </s>
<s> backup copies are always cheaper.  </s>
