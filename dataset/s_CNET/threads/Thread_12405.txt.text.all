<s> os is not important.  </s>
<s> but genrally speaking does laser last longer than inkjet?  </s>
<s> and i like epson but not had good luck with any lately.  </s>
<s> somebody said the print heads on epson are not builtin to the cartridge like hp and some others.  </s>
<s> is that true?  </s>
<s> and if so does that make it clog or break faster.  </s>
<s> thanks, confusimo  </s>
<s> might be older.  </s>
<s> look at it this way -----&gt; you change your socks every day, but you never wash your feet, ''what do you think is going to happen''? the same effect with inkcarts.  </s>
<s> while many printers use inkcarts that install new inkjets along with ink, usually tend to last longer or at least less prone to ''ink clogs/crud'', but on an epson is really a pita to deal with.  </s>
<s> at least with any other printer you can buy a new inkcart and usually proceed foward.  </s>
<s> there are trade-offs, epson makes ''great, wonderful'' output but overtime will become clogged and hard to deal with.  </s>
<s> hp and canon are far better on ink saving costs and less prone to clogs but they do get them, just beware at least as an user you can correct this w/o finally pitching the printer if it was an epson, imho.  </s>
<s> now, for laser printers.  </s>
<s> they are simply more robust overall and generally get the job dome with less hassles.  </s>
<s> the initial cost of a laser is more but you get more use out of it and if b&w model be happy for a long time. the cost for color is hard at times, but overall, if you don't need supreme output, it usually suffices.  </s>
<s> try them at a local office outlet to get a feel for them.  </s>
<s> beware of cheap or low cost color lasers, the replacement toner cost is high, so pick a ''popular model'' to at least get some saving for toner replacement.  </s>
<s> while at the local shop, check out pricing of toner carts as well.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> my last printer was an epson cx6600 and it died shortly after the warranty expired; then no authorized support center available for repair, even if on my dime.  </s>
<s> no more epsons for me. the problems were probably due to my use habits... i may go for a month or more without even turning the printer on and this leads to clogs with inkjets.  </s>
<s> i started looking for a decent color laser at an affordable price and found a konica minolta 2530cl at sams club for $249.  </s>
<s> i had a group of photos that i had printed with the epson in an envelope for mailing that i had failed to send out, and i printed the same photos on the color laser.  </s>
<s> the color laser produced much better images than the old epson in my opinion. the downside, if there is one, is that the printer is shipped with &quot;standard&quot; toner cartridges rated at about 1500 copies b/w.  </s>
<s> both &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;high-capacity&quot; cartridges are available for replacement but the h/c seem to be a little better buy.  </s>
<s> if i recall the h/c &quot;pack&quot; is about $349, but sold as 4500 prints @5%.  </s>
<s> at least i don't have to be concerned with the printhead drying out and clogging now.  </s>
<s> as i said earlier, there are times when i go for long periods without using the printer, but when i need it i expect it to produce.  </s>
<s> i have to say it again... the photos printed on this printer were much much better than i expected, and surpassed my previous inkjets.  </s>
