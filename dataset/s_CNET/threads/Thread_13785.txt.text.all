<s> is there a true plug and play available for win98se?  </s>
<s> i want to move some files/photos from an old computer that is no longer connected to the internet without having to download the drivers from a manufacturer's website ( obviously, since it isn't connected to the internet ).  </s>
<s> i will be moving the files/photos to win xp. any recommendations?  </s>
<s> w98 is too old to have the required drivers.  </s>
<s> you're gonna have to download them.  </s>
<s> just use the xp machine and burn the drivers to a cd.  </s>
<s> windows 98 (and later se) were from a time before usb memory sticks became widely available.  </s>
<s> you'll have to carry the driver either on cd or floppy so 98 (any version?) can see the stick.  </s>
<s> here's an idea.  </s>
<s> see if damn small linux can be on a fat formatted usb memory stick.  </s>
<s> then boot from said stick and copy the files out.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> get the driver(another system) and burn to cd or if small enough to a floppy.  </s>
<s> as for win9x ready flash drive, well i haven't seen one or heard of one.  </s>
<s> but, you can look and report back.  </s>
<s> sorry... tada -----willy  </s>
