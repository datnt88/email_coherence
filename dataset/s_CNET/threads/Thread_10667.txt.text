i was wondering if anyone could tell me how much of a performance gap there is between the t7200 (2ghz, 4mb l2 cache, 667mhz fsb) and the t5600 (1.83ghz, 2mb l2 cache, 667mhz fsb). how noticable would the difference be in gaming and application performance? i'm thinking of getting a dell inspiron 1505 and am debating whether or not to spend the extra cash ($75) to get the upgraded processor (i've already put all the other highest end components available on it).
^its an e1505
10% clock boost and 3-4% boost for the added cache.
do you think this boost in performance justifies an additional $75? will the increase be noticable in gaming?
but for gaming, the next higher video card will always give you a bigger performance boost. so if $75 buys a better video card, then that's where you should spend your cash.
i would...but the e1505 only offers the ati mobility radeon x1400 and the nvidia geforce go 7300. although the nvidia costs $30 more in the config, i've read and seen benchmark scores that support the ati being the better gpu. i've also since read educated opinions that suggest the 2ghz processor will have a very minimal effect on gaming, especially considering i can only put a middle of the road gpu in.
