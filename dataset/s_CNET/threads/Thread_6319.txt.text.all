<s> i live in a 3 story townhouse and my pc is set up on the first floor.  </s>
<s> my cable company provides my internet and phone services.  </s>
<s> i am on bedrest and am restricted to the 3rd floor so i have purchased a laptop.  </s>
<s> i want to be able to use it from the 3rd floor so i need to set up some type of network.  </s>
<s> i called the cable company and was told all i need to do is get a splitter and wireless router and hook it up to my cable connection on the third floor.  </s>
<s> i believe it entails more than that and wanted to check.  </s>
<s> i thought the router needed to be connected to my cable modem but that wouldn't work for me since it is on the 1st floor.  </s>
<s> any advice would be helpful.  </s>
<s> signal will reach the top floor.  </s>
<s> some will move the router closer using a length of ethernet cable.  </s>
<s> others have success in improving the reception by using those antenna extenders.  </s>
<s> only a test drive will tell.  </s>
<s> you need to hook the wireless router up to your cable modem.  </s>
<s> then you will hook your pc up to the wireless router, through one of its wired jacks.  </s>
<s> after you hook up your new router to your wireless modem, make sure you reboot (power off, power on) the modem. the problem you will probably encounter is that the wireless signal may not reach from the first floor to the third floor.  </s>
<s> the easiest way around this is to move your cable modem to the second floor.  </s>
<s> this will only work if you can move your phone up also.  </s>
<s> if you have a cable jack that you are not using, then you will not need a splitter.  </s>
<s> otherwise, disconnect the tv or cable box from the wall.  </s>
<s> then connect a two-way splitter to the wall using a short cable.  </s>
<s> make sure to connect the input side of the splitter to the wall.  </s>
<s> then reconnect the cable box or tv to one of the output jacks of the splitter.  </s>
<s> then connect your cable modem to the other output of the splitter.  </s>
<s> now you will need to connect a wireless card to your pc downstairs. the easiest way to do this is to use a usb wireless card.  </s>
<s> you should have adequate wireless signal to connect to upstairs and downstairs.  </s>
<s> if these options do not work for you, then you will have to install some additional ethernet wiring.  </s>
<s> with your wireless router you can buy a compatable antenna for it that has a stronger dbi range.  </s>
<s> for example.  </s>
<s> most wireless routers come with antennas that may have a max range of about 2dbi which indoors is about 100-300 feet but this leaves opertunities for dead spots or poor wireless signal.  </s>
<s> that is why some hotels only offer wireless from the lobby because it is closer to the wireless router.  </s>
<s> but if you get a antenna with a higher dbi like for example a 7dbi your range will be tripled.  </s>
<s> i would think of this way as being the cheapest method.  </s>
<s> otherwise you can add a range expander to your wireless router that is ac adaptable and the signal should reach fine.  </s>
