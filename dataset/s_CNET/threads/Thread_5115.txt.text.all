<s> so i have every part other then the video card or card's.  </s>
<s> i put together this assembly - e6600 , p5w dh deluxe, 400 sata2 7200 hdd, dvd burner, card reader, 900 case, raidmax 580 psu, 2 gb corsair ram at 800 mhz dual channel, all in all a good setup.  </s>
<s> but now me and my bro where thinking of 2 x1950 pro's, 200 dollars each. i need a second third opinion, i think it will be alright ?  </s>
<s> i have 3 led 120 mm fans, and 1 200 mm fan for cooling, my psu has an led fan blowing towards the mobo, and of course cpu fan  </s>
<s> will be fast as or faster than x1950s in crossfire for less cash.  </s>
<s> for your opinion  </s>
<s> which will provide the dual solution on a single pcb.  </s>
<s> as far as i know you cannot dual up the 2-way cards, but the other poster was correct that the 8800gts will provide more rendering power (ati's crossfire doesn't give a speed advantage (per se), it gives image quality advantages).  </s>
<s> the x1950's have an internal bridge connector so they both can be installed on a crossfire board, as for the 8800 gts i will do some research on that card.  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
