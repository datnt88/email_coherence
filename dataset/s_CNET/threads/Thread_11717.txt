9177	6	298367	2796013	2795525	sarchasm	6/20/08 5:00 pm	1.2139812e12	unfortunately	there's no button or shortcut on the t30 to turn on/off the wireless. i can only disable it through hardware devices.
9177	7	298367	2796036	2796013	steven haninger	6/20/08 5:54 pm	1.21398444e12	i meant to shut down and restart the laptop	instead of doing the connection repair. another thing you might try is to see if moving the laptop in such a way that flexing is minimized. put it on a cart and transport it slowly. you need to isolate the root cause and if it's an antenna dropout due to a broken wire or poor connection, this might help verify that.
