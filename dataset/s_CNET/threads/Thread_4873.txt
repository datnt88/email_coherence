6262	4	552772	5258701	5258377	swell9foot	1/11/12 3:33 am	1.32625278e12	not sure	i was just hoping there might be a cheap and simple piece of kit which might achieve what i'm after. i've done some research and haven't found anything - hence my question. i realise that if it ends up costing the same as a media streaming box then it would be pointless! has anyone found a set-up which does this simply and cheaply?

6262	6	552772	5258790	5258756	swell9foot	1/11/12 8:31 am	1.32627066e12	i wondered about that	i suspect that might be the only realistic option!
6262	7	552772	5259147	5258790	swell9foot	1/12/12 3:19 am	1.32633834e12	found the answer!!	there are 2 devices which do exactly what i'm looking for:   the first is reported to be the better device, and they're not that cheap so it's questionable whether these would be worth the money over a network/dnla type media player.
