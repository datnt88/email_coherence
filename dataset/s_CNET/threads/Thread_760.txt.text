hope this is the right forum. so i recently got a new mouse(logitech g400 &lt;3) and it needs a loving friend. when on my computer, i'm generally gaming, so i want a keyboard more designed for that. i've already looked at a few, and they seem to get generally positive reviews. $100 or less. logitech g110 razer black widow razer lycosa microsoft sidewinder x6 if you own/have owned one of these boards and/or have any insight on them/what i should get/whats better, that'd be particularly delightful. your insight is appreciated.
the logitech units tended to be mushy/mashy buttons and surprisingly the msft units were good enough to not get complaints. the msft units lasted 6+ years until we swapped the office over to laptops. bob
i'd recommend the logitech modern warfare keyboard ! it's got everything you need to intense gaming... i especially like the back-lit led keys! cheers, ted
