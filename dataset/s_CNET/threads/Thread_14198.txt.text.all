<s> dont buy ink from overstock!  </s>
<s> i bought my very first generic ink cartridge from overstock.com, and i never got around to using it until half a year later, and i found out then that it doesnt even work!  </s>
<s> and i contacted their live support, and they said they would have someone get back to me, but no one ever got back to me to help fix the cartridge, and then i did the live chat support again, and they terminated the chat, they said they couldn't do anything past the 20 days policy.  </s>
<s> terrible experience and a waste of money!  </s>
<s> i personally feel that generic ink is a bad idea from anyone, but i would not expect them to do anything about a 6 month old item that probably carried a 90 day warranty at best.  </s>
<s> six months later and you expect support?  </s>
<s> i've used overstoc.com  </s>
<s> for years; bought dvd/vcrs, laptops, desktops, etc. but i wouldn't even think about buying generic ink from anyone.  </s>
<s> don't be stingy on ink, buy what the printer is supposed to use.  </s>
<s> well im sure no one buys ink cartridges and tests them right away, and ink is a ripe off, 30 bucks for a hp cartridge, would u buy ink and test it right away?  </s>
<s> i buy the universal (brand) ink refill kits from walmart.  </s>
<s> they are the best combination of price and quality i've found, allowing me to refill my hp cartridges ~6 times for under $15. of course you have to trick the printer into thinking it's using a new cartridge (hp and most others use methods that deter refilling their cartridges despite the fact it's perfectly legal), but that's not much of a problem at all.  </s>
<s> just a suggestion.  </s>
<s> john  </s>
<s> thanks john, ill b sure to check that out at walmart(brick and mortar or online?), and what hp cartridges do you use and what do you mean by trick the printer?  </s>
<s> i never checked to see if it can be ordered online...i just stop by the local store and pick it up.  </s>
<s> as to the type, my main printer is an hp photosmart 7450, which uses the 56, 57, and 58 cartridges.  </s>
<s> however, i've done this on a few others as well.  </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- what i meant was that hp and the others don't like it when you refill the cartridges yourself because they lose money.  </s>
<s> after all, they barely make a profit on the printers themselves...most of the proceeds come from the ink and paper.  </s>
<s> so what they's done is make it difficult to refill your own.  </s>
<s> first, each cartridge has an expiration data...after the data has passed it will cease to function, even if there is ink remaining.  </s>
<s> next up, the printer has built-in memory and stores the serial number of the last 3 cartridges you used, along with the 'predicted' ink level.  </s>
<s> this is based on the length of the documents/pictures you've printed and the average coverage area per sheet.  </s>
<s> thus it could report ink remaining when it's bone dry, or say you're empty when you're not.  </s>
<s> that's a nice little problem with the 'ink level notification technology,' but something they fail to accept.  </s>
<s> now, if the printer remembers the cartridge and that it was empty, it will refuse to print, reporting an empty cartridge, even though you just refilled it.  </s>
<s> (remember, it doesn't check the actual ink level.) thus, you have to fool it into thinking it's a new ink cartridge.  </s>
<s> right now the cartridge is in slot #1 in the printer's memory.  </s>
<s> remove it, place a piece of tape over the top contact of one of the two 'points' and pop it back in.  </s>
<s> this 'new' cartridge fills in slot #1, pushing the 'real' cartridge to slot #2. now repeat covering the other top contact.  </s>
<s> 'real' moves to #3. remove the pieces of tape and pop it back in. the 'real' (untaped) cartridge now moves back into slot #1, and it's old entry in slot #3 is pushed into non-existence.  </s>
<s> (it would be moved to slot #4, but there is no slot #4.) the printer now recognizes the cartridge as new (no previous record of it in memory), and assumes it's full.  </s>
<s> at this time you can successfully print with the cartridge.  </s>
<s> you could actually try printing after placing the first piece of tape on, but one contact is being covered up, so the print may be faulty.  </s>
<s> that's why you must go through the process 3 times over.  </s>
<s> it sounds lengthy, but is quite easy, and understanding the logic in unnecessary...just trust me, it works.  </s>
<s> using that method i am able to successfully refill each cartridge 4-5 times before either the expiration date is reached or the cartridge goes south.  </s>
<s> at that time i buy a new cartridge.  </s>
<s> (i get a new hp because i don't trust those from third-parties...bad experiences.) overall i only have to buy 1 in every 6 cartridges i would have gone through, meaning i spend about $35 instead of over $120...not bad at all for a few minutes of work.  </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- now, there are a couple of notes i'd like to make: fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> threads the universal brand ink is the best i've come across at a reasonable price, and it fairly close to hp's.  </s>
<s> however, it's not guaranteed to last 100+ years, so for photo printing, don't skimp.  </s>
<s> fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> threads refilling the cartridges is fine and will not invalidate you printer's warranty.  </s>
<s> however, it does invalidate the cartridge's warranty.  </s>
<s> in addition, hp is not responsible for any damage caused by a refilled or third-party cartridge's use.  </s>
<s> the only real risk, though, is it leaking, which just makes a mess.  </s>
<s> fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> threads it's wise to leave the cartridge sit out overnight on a piece of plastic to make sure it doesn't leak before reinstalling t. you should also print out a couple of pages for the quality to be restored.  </s>
<s> hope this helps, and enjoy!  </s>
