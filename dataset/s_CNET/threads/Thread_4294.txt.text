i've heard that since seagate bought out maxtor, their hd's have gone downhill fast. can anyone tell me if there are certain drives in particular that are problematical? are there seagate/maxtor drives and seagate drives?
if concerned, just get the seagate model. i will note that certain maxtor sata ii models require a firmware upgrade to function properly with nforce3 and nforce4 chipsets. this is documented at maxtor.com.
i guess i'll have to email support. i'm looking for external drives and offhand, there's no labeling or such that tells me i'm getting a seagate or maxtor.
...and internal hard drive and install it in an external enclosure.
