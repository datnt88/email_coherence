in either configuring a new desktop pc or purchasing a pre-configured desktop pc; which is considered to be better? a desktop pc having a cdrw/dvdrw combo drive or a desktop pc having two separate drives such as a cdrw in one drive and a dvdrw in a second drive? comments from anyone would certainly be appreciated. big steve end of message 02/02/05
i use two devices. one is a simple cd/dvd reader and the other a burner. the burner type depends on your needs. one reason for this is so disks can be duplicated by copying directly to the burner and bypass the need to copy to the hd first. i't just my personal choice.
with dual layer dvdrw drives under 99 bucks (much less) i can fit one of those and do-it-all. since a dvdrom drive can do all a cdrom can do and more, that may be in the second bay for easy cd dupes. bob
my experience tells me that a simple cdrom drive is much more capable of reading scratched or otherwise &quot;damaged&quot; disks than a writer or a combo. i find that utilities like cdr diagnostics, iso buster etc are able to handle a wider range of the so called dead cd's in a simple cdrom drive than in other combined drive/writers. as far as dvd's go, i'm not ready to make any observation as of now.
i've found cdrw drives to be more adept at reading so-so cds. my experience with the newer dvdrw drives is &quot;not enough time yet&quot; to write if i feel the same for them. bob
i want to take this time to thank everyone for their comments. big steve end of reply 02/02/05
