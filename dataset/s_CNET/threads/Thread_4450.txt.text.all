<s> i have an hp pavilion dv9000 laptop where my wireless card stopped working.  </s>
<s> i was able to get it back working using linksys easylink advisor software and power-cycling my linksys router.  </s>
<s> anyways i am curious has to ideas about what caused it to temporarily stop working.  </s>
<s> i have heard stories about hp laptops' wireless cards failing permanently(this model has known overheating issues particularly with its motherboard).  </s>
<s> i really want to do anything i can do to prevent that.  </s>
<s> i use a laptop fan and i wonder if i should unscrew the back of the laptop to try to clean out dust near the wireless card.  </s>
<s> or are the wireless cards not really affected by heat issues?  </s>
<s> or could it be something completely different that caused this?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> when this happens, do you get some sort of hardware error message or failure shown in device manager? the reason i ask is that, with wireless connections, other factors are involved.  </s>
<s> these can be your router or another persons nearby as well as other forms of rf. can you verify it's your own wireless card?  </s>
<s> as for cooling, it's well known that laptops need cleaning and it's not always as easy to do as desktops.  </s>
<s> minimally you clean the fan and exhaust path using compressed air.  </s>
<s> if you find it very dusty, you disassemble and clean what you are comfortable doing.  </s>
<s> that's what happens occasionally with all machines.  </s>
<s> but what i'm encountering today are people that think the machines should be flawless.  </s>
<s> we're not there yet.  </s>
<s> as to what causes this is simple.  </s>
<s> there is some bug, glitch or such in the driver, os or system.  </s>
<s> this will not be the last time you encounter such glitches.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hmmm that's a good point.  </s>
<s> before i power-cycled my router i did check the wireless card in device manager and it said &quot;device is working properly&quot;.  </s>
<s> so i guess it was a problem with my router?  </s>
<s> i found it interesting that when i right-clicked on the wireless icon in the taskbar and selected &quot;diagnose&quot; that it reset the wireless card settings but that this didn't fix the problem.  </s>
<s> in the past when this has happened, doing that has fixed the problem.  </s>
<s> i'm using vista home premium.  </s>
<s> i'm still thinking of trying to clean the wireless card area; is it as simple as unscrewing the panel beneath the wireless card and spraying canned air?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply, i'll keep that in mind.  </s>
