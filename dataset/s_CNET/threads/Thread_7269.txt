(tried re-seating it several times) looking for a replacement agp card - any suggestions - there don't seem to be many around these days and don't want to have to mess with changing power supply etc.. another question can i use a pci card instead - would the pc boot up if i used one in place of an agp type? thanks pc dell 8200 windows xp 256mb memory
