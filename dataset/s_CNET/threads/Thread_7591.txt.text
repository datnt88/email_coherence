hi, i need to controll 2 computers by one set of keyboard and mouse. i do not need a kvm switch. i need a usb switch that will keep the first km connection active even when i am connecting to the second computer so that when i connect back to the first it would not give me the &quot;hud&quot; pop-ups each time. any idea what i could use? thanks!
best of luck in your search. bob
what you probably need is a manual kvm switch, not an automatic switch. a manual switch keeps a load on the ports at all times so the pc doesn't realize that the keyboard and mouse aren't connected. we use a manual switch in our shop to connect up to four pc's to the same keyboard, mouse and display and haven't had any problems. an automatic switch caused many problems, but the manual one doesn't.
