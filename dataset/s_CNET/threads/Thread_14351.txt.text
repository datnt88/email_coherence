seems that there is a setting to either record media in the background or with priority. can anyone tell me where it is?
you set the priority level. i use &quot;top&quot; to do that. bob ps. you didn't pick an os so i answered for the one i had a ready answer.
it's xp home.
but you can use this dma off/on procedure to ensure that the channel is not in cpu robbing pio mode -&gt;   reveals about all that is known about this feature. bob
i guess what i saw was in some third party software such as nero. son-in-law had downloaded a trial version on my pc last week. i remember the dvd burn was taking six forevers and we made some change that sped things up considerably. i guess the changes were in the trial version software.
