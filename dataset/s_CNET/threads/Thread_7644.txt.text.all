<s> issue: unable to maintain wireless connection to internet via router.  </s>

<s> this happens no matter the distance from the router, whether right next to it or in the next room.  </s>
<s> there are 3 other computers that connect to the same router (2 wirelessly and 1 wired) and do not have this disconnect problem.  </s>
<s> have used winsockfix.exe  </s>
<s> (version 1.0) obtained from geek squad, but still experience problem.  </s>
<s> wireless card has been reseated.  </s>
<s> tried to use windows xp network diagnostics, but wlan repairs connection before i am able to complete the diagnostics.  </s>
