hi everyone, i have a five year old ibm laptop, and i need a ram upgrade for it. how do i find the right kind of ram that will fit, and run in my machine? thanks in advance.
recommend heading over to  and check out the ram options there. vapcmd
the only way i know how w/out opening up the laptop is to find the specs of your laptop on the internet and see what kind of motherboard it has, then find the specs of the motherboard and you should be able to find what kind of ram you need.
