<s> did that it didn't come up in windows explorer.  </s>
<s> had a look in disk management and it was sitting there without a drive letter, it said unknown disk type, not initialized and unallocated.  </s>
<s> now i have some very important things on this drive i need.  </s>
<s> i asked a friend what to do, he said take it back to the original pc and back it up.  </s>
<s> did that, it comes up with the same thing.  </s>
<s> both pc's are xp, i haven't changed it from being the slave drive and there is a master in both pc's.  </s>
