<s> hello - i'm shopping around for a new video card, and i noticed that there are a number of cards that appear to be ati cards, but have a different brand name.  </s>
<s> for example, i found a &quot;sapphire ati radeon x800 pro video card&quot; in one online store.  </s>
<s> my question is, is there any difference between cards like this and the ones labeled specifically ati, other than the price?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> they use the model ati chip advertised, but they may set it up entirely differently, including the rate that they clock the memory or set other parameters.  </s>
<s> some sites provide the clocking info.  </s>
<s> thanks for the info, i'll remember to look into that.  </s>
