<s> i am using a bt homhub to connect wirelessly to the internet at home.  </s>
<s> i have been using this hub for over a year now and i am the only person in the house who uses the wifi as the other computer is connected by ethernet.  </s>
<s> recently the internet on my computer has stopped working, it appears connected but web pages wont load.  </s>
<s> when i have a look at my connections the ssid of my hub appears twice and im connected by default to the second one (i have linked to a screen shot below).  </s>
<s> while my computer is not loading the internet the one that is connected via ethernet works fine.  </s>
<s> is there any settings i can change that may have caused this to happen or do i need to get a new hub?  </s>
<s> thanks screen shot:  </s>
<s> sorry i forgot to mention that sometimes resetting the hub works and sometimes it doesnt it is not a complete solution to the problem.  </s>
<s> you change the ssid?  </s>
<s> also, there is a hack software that kids run that spoof the station ssid.  </s>
<s> look up cnet evil twin on google.  </s>
<s> but that issue vanishes when you set it up per our forum sticky.  </s>
