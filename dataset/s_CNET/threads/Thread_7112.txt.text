i am looking for a tablet with the following features. + calendar + to do list + skype + internet the catch is i can only pay $200 i am willing to sacrifice skype for this price. can anyone help me?
only skype on the list pushes you on the hardware selection. that is, skype requires the camera and enough cpu oompg. internet access is so far on all tablets. and todo, calendars can be replaced with new apps from the various stores. i can't tell what country so i can't give you any starter ideas. bob
oh, i live in the usa. montana to be excact
you should keep shopping for something like this for your price. bob
i didn't know the galaxy tab was going for my price! thank you
