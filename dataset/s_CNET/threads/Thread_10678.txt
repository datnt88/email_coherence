(satellite) i will be replacing it with the basic dsl service from at&t. now, i have two offices currently networked (wired) together and because i am on the basic dsl service plan (will upgrade when available) i would like for each office to have its own connection to the internet to lighten the load. yet, i still want them to be networked for file sharing. this is what i envision: office one: modem 1 router 1 -will be given the address of 192.168.1.1 -will not be set as a dhcp server -will allow ip connections from 192.168.1.2-50 hey everyone this is my first post here. i am not a networking expert and i need some help and possible clarification. first let me start off by saying i currently am switching from hughes net broadband internet service.

(my switch does not have the option to change any settings.) i know about dual wan routers but have never worked with them. also, from my understanding the second wan is for back-up purposes only. unless, you can specifiy on a dual wan router which computers use what connection i do not think it would be helpful. thanks, tommy

(and expect it to work.) possible resolution. dsl line -&gt; dsl modem -&gt; wireless router -&gt; various computers connected via ethernet cable and/or wireless. set file and printer sharing on all pcs.
