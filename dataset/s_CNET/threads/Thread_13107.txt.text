i just installed a radeon 9250 pci stealth video card, with 256 megs of memory. to my surprise, it does not seem to display video any faster than the intel video that is built into the motherboard. other owners have commented on increased redraw speed but i cannot tell any difference. i have downloaded and installed the latest ati drivers. i run a pretty standard clone computer with an intel 845g chipset, 512 megs of ram, xp home edition and a 1.8 ghz processor. is there some configuration utility or method that i am missing to kick this card into high gear?
pci express? if yes, the pci bus runs at half the speed or less than the agp bus and is not a dedicated bus. it is shared with other pci cards. however, i dfo know that ati drivers can be a bear to install properly.
sometimes there is only so much one can do to improve older computers. in what program/game do you wish to improve redraw speed?
nowadays, video cards only differentiate themselves by how well they handle 3d games (doom, half life 2, call of duty, splinter cell, oblivion, etc.). outside of gaming, your integrated intel graphics are just as good as any other video card.
thanks very much for the help. this card fits into a regular pci slot, so i suppose it can only work as well as pci allows.
