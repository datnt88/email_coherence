having a problem surfing the internet on a hp dv1000. if i unplug the ac adapter the pages take forever to load, but it works just fine if it is plugged in. hp seems to think it is a defective battery, but never have seen such a problem. any help?
and is there spyware on this machine? i don't see a hardware issue yet. bob
there is no spyware on the machine. it now won't let me download anything. if the power cable is plugged in i can, but if it is unplugged it won't let me download.
i have a toshiba laptop. the ethernet port will not work if the ac is unpluged, it will only work it the ac adpter is pluged in. i guess you hp is the same way. john
