<s> i was wondering if i could play blu-ray in windows vista media center.  </s>
<s> i know i can play it with the supplied software and i got sonys $200 blu-ray drive.  </s>
<s> but i wanted to use vistas.  </s>
<s> im using a barebones shuttle pc with vista home prem, core quad, radion 2600hd with hdmi and i know every complies with hdcp.  </s>
<s> if you've done your research you'll find &quot;it's up to these developers to determine whether the environment they have set up will meet the environment criteria the &quot;content owners&quot; impose on manufacturers.  </s>
<s> so that probably no next-gen playback for vista out of the box.  </s>

<s> ohhkayy, that puts more closure on that, i didnt think you could.  </s>
<s> ive read alot from mags awhile back (when hd-dvd was still selling) that you couldnt, but was kinda hoping that its changed since then..  </s>
<s> you could change out the drive and i see that the cost of blu ray drives has dropped significantly over the past couple of months.  </s>
<s> it is like being between a rock and a hardplace, hd, then blu ray, what to do.  </s>
<s> geez, look at the price of blu ray disks!  </s>
