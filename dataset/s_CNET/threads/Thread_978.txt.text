hi friends, i want to buy a tv tuner card i need a suggestion that which one should i buy intex, pixelview or pinnacle, do mention me the model as well if possible, thanking you
haven't tried the makes you named. bob
if you're looking for a all-in-one tv tuner solution. they'll be able to provide you tech support if you need it. if you're going to use seperate tv/media software such as beyondtv, the prolink pixelview is an ok choice. check you media software's compatibility list and use it to decide. i'm not familiar with the intex, but from their website i'd steer clear of them since they appear to be a small manufacturer that's apt to drop a product line at any time.
