is there any way to burn vcr tapes to my pc? my son (now deceased) was assistant athetic trainer for the alabama crimson tide from 1979-199. i have vcr tapes for every televised crimson tide game from 1985-1990. i want to heep them in a better format, and perhaps to edit and burn them to dvd-rw disks. thanks, ed henne
my wife faced the same thing: many vcr tapes of instructional videos that she wanted to convert to digital format. we went to best buy and bought a dvd recorder that also had a vcr deck. dubbing tapes to dvd is a cinch, though you do have to do that in real time. once you have the dvds burned, you can use software (i use a dvd ripper from xilisoft) to rip those dvds into smaller mpegs if you want. but i suspect you just want dvds of the tapes, so the dual deck is the way to go. not expensive either.
why not just get a dvd recorder?
that's the method i use. a 55 buck dvd recorder. then off to the pc with the discs. for quick editing i use the following titles (the free ones.) virtual dub (snip snip!) dvd flick (that was easy) imgburn (that is good stuff) bob
