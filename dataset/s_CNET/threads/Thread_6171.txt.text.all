<s> hello, i have some great cd burning utilites from my plextor drive, but i retired the drive cuz it was only 12x.  </s>
<s> can i install and use those programs those on a win 2000 machine with a 52x lite-on drive?  </s>
<s> or will it only work with the plextor drive?  </s>

<s> oem bundled software rarely works across drives.  </s>
<s> you can try it, but don't get too much hope... bob  </s>
<s> i agree with robert, bundled s/w isn't a given to work on other drives, but you can try.  </s>
<s> now, maybe a good time to try a &quot;retail&quot; versions and understand they offer alot more than when you got your older s/w. the most notable are roxio and nero.  </s>
<s> i lean towards nero, but you can check your cd/rw burner support website they may provide an oem for your use.  </s>
<s> if you like a very cheap retail version(older), try this website: and look for cd creator v3.x, i believe under s/w area.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> if it is name brand burning software, it probably won't recognize the newer drive.  </s>
<s> you may be able to upgrade the drive recognition part of the software for free.  </s>
<s> if you have saved burning profiles, some burning software is not backwards compatible (yes roxio, i mean you!) the new drive doesn't have decent software?  </s>
<s> well this old plextor has a program called audio capture that is just so easy.  </s>
<s> i still have it running in a win 98 machine.  </s>
<s> no muss, no fuss.  </s>
<s> i miss it.  </s>
<s> with these new programs, i always forget which of the 200 buttons does the one thing i want.  </s>
<s> i actually have to write little notes to myself to remind me how to do some simple task that took an hour of digging around in menus to find.  </s>
<s> i can't decipher the program that came with my creative sound card.  </s>
