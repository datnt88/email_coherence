i've been doing some fairly heavy-duty scanning in recent days with my canon mp830 multifunction printer/scanner. suddenly, whenever i use the auto-document feeder, it scans in a thin line running the full length of the document, from top to bottom about 1/4 of the document in from the left margin. the line appears blue in a color document, and also appears in black and white scans. interestingly, the line only appears on scans using the adf. when i put the document directly on the platen glass, there is no line. and the paper document itself comes out of the process without any issues, so it's not as if the adf or scanning process is somehow leaving a mark on the paper document which is being scanned in. i'm stumped. the only thing i can figure is that one of the thin wires that the scanner bulb moves back and forth on is somehow getting scanned in. but i have no idea. anyone experienced something like this?
i figured it out. the problem was one tiny speck on the platen glass that is used during the adf scanning process. somehow in all the cleaning i did, i missed this spot and had to be at just the right angle to see it.
this worked for me!
