<s> i have an hp 7200 series all-in-one printer with usb and ethernet connections.  </s>
<s> i have 2 wireless laptops with access to the internet.  </s>
<s> i want to buy some kind of wireless print sharer that will allow me to print from both laptops.  </s>
<s> i do not need/want the printer itself to be hooked up to the company network.  </s>
<s> all i want to do is print wirelessly from 2 laptops.  </s>
<s> i guess i want to plug the ethernet connection on the printer to an ethernet connection on whatever wireless device i should by and thats all the physical connections i have to make.  </s>
<s> i then just want to be able to print wirelessly from both laptops.  </s>
<s> i have a wireless router that came with my laptop and couldn't make that work for this job.  </s>
<s> what kind of hardware do i need?  </s>
<s> regards, andy  </s>
<s> then plug that into your lan and follow hp's instructions for printing over the lan.  </s>
<s> a print server would only serve to waste time and money.  </s>

<s> i can't plug the printer into the lan.  </s>
<s> well, i could but it wouldn't work.  </s>
<s> all the computers, or anything else plugged into the lan, at sikorsky have special chips in them.  </s>
<s> no chip, no access.  </s>

<s> your it staffer needs to get involved.  </s>
<s> they have a secure lan and even with a print server this will be quite a mess.  </s>
<s> let your it staffer do their magic.  </s>
