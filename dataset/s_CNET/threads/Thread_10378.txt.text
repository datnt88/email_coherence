if i backup my toshiba satellite l305-s5885 laptop 250gb hard drive to an external 250gb hard drive and then restore my laptop hard drive back to day 1 (brand new status), can i selectively put files back on the restored hard drive? so i can get rid of unnecessary files. the reason for the restore is an error message that i get every time i reboot my laptop that requires me to put the windows disk in the cd drive which came with the laptop which i bought brand new. i'm hoping to eliminate this error message and &quot;spring clean&quot; my computer's hard drive.
&quot;, can i selectively put files back on the restored hard drive? &quot; please don't take this wrong but it's too likely that the clone would fail in new and wonderful ways. it is time to backup what files you can't lose then restore the machine with the restore dvds you made when the machine was new. bob
the external hard drive is an &quot;all or nothing backup&quot; procedure. so i need to delete the files i don't want before the &quot;all or nothing&quot; backup, then backup the laptop hard drive, then do my &quot;restore to original state procedure&quot;, then sync the external hard drive with the laptop and put all my &quot;keeper&quot; files back on the laptop hard drive? is that correct??
why is that external an all or nothing procedure? the failure you note is not uncommon but any full copy would have the same problem when you restore from it. so that plan is flawed. what works well is to copy our files out to 2 or more places then use the restore media. i then reinstall my basic applications and copy my files back in. bob
sounds right, that's what i will do. thanks again!
