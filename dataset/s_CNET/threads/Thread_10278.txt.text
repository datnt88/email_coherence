hi, i have a vertical red line that you can see through on my dell 20inch lcd. the line comes on after few minutes of turning on the monitor. would this be most likely the monitor or the video card? is the only way to check by plugging the pc to a different monitor? thanks
you didn't give the model number so i can't find if this has it's own self test.
have you recently added this a new video card or updated video drivers? if not its probably the monitor. if you have it is probably one of those. connecting your monitor to a new pc is best bet, but plugging another monitor to your pc would also work.
