(let's not get into hyperthreading discussion in depth, although it may play a part, if i5's actually have it) so ... even though intel chips quite often outperform amd chips, will those 8-core amd chips have a noticable advantage above those 4-core intels? if not, will those extra 4 cores allow the amd chips to perform as well as the intels? i bring that up because all of the amd's, with only 1 sole exception, are up to 60 bucks cheaper. i'm not building a bargain-basement system here, but i'm also a disabled vet with fixed income. $25 doesn't matter, $60 might. so will i get better performance from those faster, bigger, & cheaper amds? or will the somewhat more expensive, smaller, & slower intels still outdo them? that's the main question & the only one i need a definite answer to. however, as hinted at above, there are 3 more cpus i'm eyeing as curiosities. the a10-5800k, a10-5700, & a8-5600k apus, with integrated graphics. now right off the bat i know these don't ompute as well as any of the 6 above, but they aren't dramatically too far back. my new build will have a great graphics card in it, so i'm not saying i'll rely on the onboard video. but the plan is to buy sli/crossfire capable stuff, but only 1 card for now. i'm not even sure i'll like a dual graphic set-up, but doing it this way allows me to add that second card later, if i so choose. but will these chips with onboard radeon graphics work together with a dedicated radeon card, much like a crossfire setup? he biggest & neatest advantage i see by going this apu-route is that i would still have working video if i blew my card up. (remember i said that i oc'd .... well, sometimes i od too & burn something up ) so does either of these reasons give me a legitimate reason to go with the less powerful apus, which will actually do all the computing i want to do anyway? last thing, an &quot;addie&quot; since we got to talking about onboard graphic stuff. i noticed that some new mobos have some decent onboard graphics now. will this graphics do an sli/crossfire-type deal with a dedicated video card? does it have to be the same brand? in other words, if the mobo graphics are radeon, will it work with nvidia, or just radeon? this option would allow me to do what i should do anyway & go with one of the faster pure-cpus. but then i'd still have that extra graphics when i melt my new dedicated video card. thanks in advance for all help.
