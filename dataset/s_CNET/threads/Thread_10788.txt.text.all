i am looking to upgrade a old mac and i was wondering if i need any special parts or can i use regular pc parts. 
for example do i need to buy special ram or can i just use any ram i find. 
thanks for your help! 
yes u have to buy specific ram and not any ram u can find. 
go to kingston or crucial or pny websites to try and find if they have any ram compatible with ur apple. 
desk top...laptop? 
what model? 
what os? find this out and go post on the mac hardware forum for a more complete answer.
