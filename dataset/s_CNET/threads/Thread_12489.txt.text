i have an lcd tv, the usual connections. hdmi, s-video, component, etc.. and i have on my pc a radeon x1900. i can't seem to figure out what i need in order to connect my pc to my tv...there isn't a computer connection on the tv itself...at least nothing requiring a lot of pins...so, i'm not sure what i need for that card?
hdmi slot card, then you have audio and video.
when members ask this question it would be nice to know the make, model of the video card if the member doesn't tell the connections available. bob
here's a typical dvi-hdmi cable . if you want the pc's audio on your tv, you'll also need an audio cable.
