<s> i have a hitachi external hard drive that worked fine one morning and stopped working when i came back from college. it simply does not power on at all, as if the power cable is not even connected.  </s>
<s> i have tried it on two different computers the unit is definitely not receiving power so my question is, would buying a new enclosure save my data?  </s>
<s> i use my external hard drive to stream music and video from my nintendo wii and it's imperative that i save it.  </s>
<s> a new enclosure would have to conform to the specs of 3.5&quot; and 2tb.  </s>
<s> i can't afford data recovery and i want to save my approaching 1tb worth of content.  </s>
<s> this is it and thanks for any help i've had trouble finding answers.  </s>
<s> why? because we can't try it.  </s>
<s> but if you want your data, it's the best 20 buck gamble you can take today.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> sounds as if the dc inverter has failed (the adapter that plugs into a/c power).  </s>
<s> if you take the unit to a radio shack or someone who has a volt ohm meter handy this is a very easy thing to check., there is a pretty good chance that the drive itself is fine.  </s>
