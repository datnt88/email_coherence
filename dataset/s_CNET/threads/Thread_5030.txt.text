i am planning on buying a wifi router. however i am confused between 3 of them. please help me on choosing the best possible one. here's the link of all 3. cisco linksys e900 wireless-n300 router belkin basic surf (n300) router netgear jnr3000 n300 gigabit router and here is the url in which i've compared all 3 of them. comparison
i got it to work after i read advice to go back a firmware version. i see new firmware but why did it take them months? sorry, i'd remove netgear. my neighbor had too many problems with the cisco models so by removing those names we are left with the belkin. even belkin has had issues in the past such as  but that's a decade ago and they corrected this and learned their lesson from what i can tell. bob
try asus dsl-n10e i've been using this from last 8 months have not encountered even a single problem till date .. the range i quite good too !
while you cannot go wrong with cisco or netgear , you should relly also include dlink routers. wireless ac1200 dual band gigabit cloud router dir-860l
cisco has some models that are pretty poor in coverage. and netgear had that issue for months about connections with apple products. my advice is to return defects rather than try to work with the makers. bob
