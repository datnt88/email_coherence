<s> hello all! the time has come for me to upgrade my old noisy and jerky hp deskjet 640c printer.  </s>
<s> i have done a little reseacrh and i think that a canon pixma would be the best for me.  </s>
<s> i need an aio for upto a maximum of $150.  </s>
<s> i will be using it at home.  </s>
<s> i dont think i will be printing a lot of pictures.  </s>
<s> the only pictures will be printed on normal a4 size paper for school projects.  </s>
<s> i will almost never use glossy photo paper.  </s>
<s> i think i an live without fax as i have never used it but i would use it a bit if my printer has one.  </s>
<s> scanning negatives would be a privilege so that i can digitize years of pictures.  </s>
<s> i can however live without it as i have all along.  </s>
<s> the main features i would like to concentrate on is text printing.  </s>
<s> it should be cheap and fast to do so.  </s>
<s> preferably with a special text only cartridge.  </s>
<s> networking would be a very nice feature for ease of use but if it is possible to connect a laptop or an 'outsider' computer easily then networking does not matter.  </s>
<s> will it be possible to print a pdf or word doc from an sd card or usb flash drive on either of these printers, while choosing which pages to print or giving it the pages numbers.  </s>
<s> an automatic document feeder would be really good while a flat bed is included.  </s>
<s> noise can become an issue for me.  </s>
<s> my friend has a pixma as well and he mentioned a quiet mode.  </s>
<s> this feature should be included so that i can print at night.  </s>
<s> optical chrachter recognition should also be included.  </s>
<s> i cant list all the required features here.  </s>
<s> for this reason i would appreciate it, if someone thorough with the canon pixma range's, can list out all the features that make a difference between the printers.  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> i have done some more research and boiled down to the mp530 and 600.  </s>
<s> i would appreciate it if you could suggest some more printers from other brands or the same pixma line.  </s>
<s> i would also like to know the differences between the mp 530 and 600.  </s>
<s> thank you and plz respond.  </s>
<s> first off, the canon line is the best inkjet printer out there for home users today.  </s>
<s> if you look at the cost, features, and cost of cartridges, they are top.  </s>
<s> plus the quality is good. the 530 has a fax, the 600 doesn't.  </s>
<s> that is the main difference.  </s>
<s> hp has some decent ones if you get one that takes the 96 black and 97 color.  </s>
<s> other than that, there isn't one i can recommend.  </s>
