howdie all. i have a &quot;very&quot; old gw2k solo 9300 ve laptop that i had upgraded my old 12gb hdd to a 40gb hdd a number of years ago. while i'd love to buy a newer laptop, budgets are such now that it'll have to wait. i can however get a larger hard drive, and have been reviewing the larger, and newer hard drives. and yes-- i can hear your peanut gallery comments already, so just please stick with my question. what is the difference in the connection interface between the old ultradma-ata 100, and the new sata connections? i must be using the wrong search criteria because i can't find side by side comparison descriptions. so, if you know of any websites that show the differences, those would work. thank you for your responses.
readily available on the seagate or western digital websites. vapcmd
in laptops you can't swap between those so let's look at a list of what should work (given no os and more.) since it's an older laptop i'd stick to drives under 127gb.  shows a few 80gb drives for 60 and under. bob
the older ide/ata drives have a double row of twenty pins which includes power. sata has a small connector and another separate power connector. the two drives are not interchangeable.
to go on without falling back to peanuts gallery with this computer:   it's unwise to spend anymore on it without the upgrade part having a future. why not buy an external usb drive to accommodate your growing storage? ...and make sure you follow all the sage advise about backups.
thank you all for your replies. this info was very helpful. best to all.
