i have a westell router hooked between my main computer and laptop. no problems until today,laptop keeps telling me cannot find server when i try to access the internet. both computers are running win xp home. my signal is very good,right now i'm beside the main computer which is working fine. any ideas.
open a command prompt and type, ipconfig /all and hit enter. post the results here so forum members can better assist you.
i have forgotten how to open a command prompt.
easiest way to access is to enter cmd in the run dialog box.
