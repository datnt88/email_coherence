3327	13	239251	3161552	3161448	joey301	10/29/09 9:31 am	1.25680866e12	simpletech's answer	here is their final answer from tech support this model drive has not been in production for almost three years so they were never tested in vista. if the drive does not work in 7 we have no drivers to help. if the drive still works on a xp system there is no problem with the drive it is just not compatible with 7. that does not make sense to me. why is something not compatible, there should always be a method.
