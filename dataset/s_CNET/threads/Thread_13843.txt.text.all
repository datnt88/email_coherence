<s> hello, microboards also carries a product called the orbit ii. this machine has batch-mode capabilities, will run until it is out of cds and also has a reject feature that will kick out bad discs.  </s>
<s> batch-mode processing is new feature to the orbit ii. as the unit receives the first master disc it copies it into the unit's hard drive then duplicates onto blank discs until it recieves another master and the process is repeated.  </s>
<s> the orbit ii is available in either 52x cd or 8x dvd, features a choice of copy, copy/verify, or verify only and an easy to use two button interface.  </s>
