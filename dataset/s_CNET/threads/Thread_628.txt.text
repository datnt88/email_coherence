i have: intel core2 duo processor e4300 (1.8ghz, 800 fsb) 3gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 667mhz- 4dimms nvidia geforce 7300 le intel 965 express i really need to upgrade the video card. i have a pci-e slot. my goal on this upgrade is to have the whole computer become obsolete at the same time, in time for my next upgrade. this move should hold me for about another year. which card would i need to get? give me list...
1. review the link below ... and select a couple of video cards to look at  2. check the relative performance here . . especially if you're a gamer.  3. then look at the products here for current price and more important buyer reviews.  4. from here, it's your $$, your choice. vapcmd
and can spend at least $170. this radeon hd2900gt is much faster than a geforce 8600gts and about the same price, $170:  ati released the new radeon hd3870 and hd3850 today (11/15) and they're supposed to retail for $220 and $180. if you can wait, the hd3850 will be a better choice than the hd2900gt (which may fall in price). if you want the best gaming card for about $250, get the geforce 8800gt/512. they debuted a couple of weeks ago and are back-ordered at most sites. the geforce 8800gt/256 is supposed to appear in a couple of weeks and run about $200. it will probably be about as fast as the radeon hd3870. if you're not a gamer there's nothing wrong with your 7300le. if you can't afford $170 but still want to game a bit, this radeon x1650 is $60:
thx
