<s> my mouse keeps freezing up.  </s>
<s> i am running xp pro.  </s>
<s> i thought it might be my cordless mouse but i put on the old mouse and it still does the same thing.  </s>
<s> i have to shut my computer down to get it to work.  </s>
<s> it will work for awhile then it does it again.  </s>
<s> if this is not the right forums to ask this question, please direct me to the proper one.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> you'd have to provide more information.  </s>
<s> mouse freeze is a type of system freeze, and often, a complete lockup follows right afterwards.  </s>
<s> could be caused by anything...  </s>
<s> the mouse will not move but my keyboard will still work.  </s>
<s> since i am not very good at using the keyboard to access things i just turn the computer off.  </s>
<s> i thought i might have an virus so i ran norton and plus i ran spy doctor to check and see if anything would be there too.  </s>
<s> i think you may have a virus/spyware, as you suggested.  </s>
<s> try looking at your process list to see if you have any unnecessary processes running.  </s>
<s> if you press-and-hold ctrl, then shift, then delete, the task manager will open.  </s>
<s> next, click the &quot;processes&quot; tab, and click on the &quot;name&quot; button.  </s>
<s> this will alphabatize them, which sometimes helps.  </s>
<s> go to... ... this site for help on what processes are needed and what ones are not.  </s>
<s> once you have closed several processes that are unneeded, your computer will probably speed up some.  </s>
<s> also, it might be good if you go into the options menu, select &quot;hide when minimized,&quot; and then minimize it. the little performance icon will sit in your tray, and you can monitor when your computer gets slower, because you will see more green bars lit.  </s>
<s> if your mouse freezes up, and the box is completely green, you know that it is freezing up because of your computer being slow.  </s>
<s> hope this helps... hasta luego!  </s>
