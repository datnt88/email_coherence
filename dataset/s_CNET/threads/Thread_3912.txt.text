hi im having a hard timed/l a video driver. its for a compaq f500 laptop working with windows xp home edtion 32 bit c/n cnf7161rhm. any help will be great thank you.
also, xp is a bit of trouble. it may require a very involved install routine. so my question is did you ask hp as they sometimes put the drivers on a secret ftp site. example at link.  notice that more than a video driver was required. bob
ty bob ill keep trying have a great day
