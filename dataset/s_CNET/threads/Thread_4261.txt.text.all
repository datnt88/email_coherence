<s> when i insert a blank dvd to burn, the burning process does not start right away.  </s>
<s> i have a delay of between 5 minutes and 2 hours before the process starts.  </s>
<s> this is after clicking burn, with the burn window open, buffer is at 100%, cpu usage at 0%. happens with both alcohol and nero, any burn software i try.  </s>
<s> tried turning off anti-virus, firewall, closing all programs and still occurs - but does not occur when i reboot and burn the dvd prior to opening any programs (other than start-up items).  </s>
<s> running xp, all updates etc. recent fresh install (to see if that fixed the problem).  </s>
<s> an odd note is that when this occurs, the window that pops up asking what you want to do with the dvd you just inserted pops up a long time after the dvd was inserted - like it takes a long time for windows to see it has a new dvd.  </s>
<s> but any program that uses the dvd (other than burning) works right away.  </s>
<s> any thoughts... thanks.  </s>
<s> i wonder if this is why i never experienced your issue?  </s>

<s> when i try that, it sees the blank dvd and then hangs at that point, same as if i place the dvd in before the software is loaded....  </s>
<s> drivers, bios, firmware in devices, cabling, jumpers and more.  </s>
<s> your post only supplies a symptom and no clue which area could be amiss.  </s>
<s> i would be check each area to see what's up.  </s>
