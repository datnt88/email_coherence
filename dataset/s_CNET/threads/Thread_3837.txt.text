i have a 500 gig seagate hard drive (sata) that is no longer working as an external (broken bus ). i'm considering using it as extra storage space. i have 2 ide drives that i'm using as master and slave. i run windows xp. my question is: can i use the sata as storage and keep the ide as my boot drive?
let's say you give me ten pcs with ide and sata connections. i would and could encounter ten different setups with no two being the same. which means the answer is maybe. only your machine's maker can guide you to the right settings if you can't figure it out on your own. and you can imagine i don't want to write down all the ten ways this could be configured in the bios, the os and the drivers. welcome the the (pc) tarpit issue. bob
the question to ask would be, does your pc have sata connectors and support? if not, i would not recommend drop in sata cards. fusing legacy products, i have found to be quite troublesome.
