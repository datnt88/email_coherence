hi, i saw the editorial review of ximeta ndas drive which has received high points. it looks impressive,however; i have a few doubts - 1. the review said that it does not have media server capabilities : i would like to know what this exactly means because one of the test details provided was read/write and access time for media. 2. would i be able to remote-access the drive using a vpn (hamachi) thank you
go look at a nas next time. save yourself some headaches. sorry but i'll stop here. bob
thank you for your response. pls elaborate i am not considering this for backup purposes, i just want a centralized location for all my media (have backups on dvd's and cd's). cnet rates ximeta as having a good transfer speed (the fastest in the list). nas or ndas i just want a drive from which i will be able to read/write media files (350mb - 8gb)without glitches/interruptions i am also not bothered by the requirement to install driver software for use( the number of computers that would be accessing files stored on the drive is just one) i would also like you to elaborate on the media serving shortcomings of ximeta in some detail(i just dont understand what it means) thankyou
which is why i stopped. bob
