hello i am getting a thinkcenter m50 with a celeron 2.66 mhz and 512mb of pc2700 it has (1) open agp and (3)open pci slots any thougths on a good low to mid-range video card? 
my old system had a nvidia geforce mx440 64mb can this be used? 
you mentioned can be used on the new system. 
as far as a better card, i would suggest one with 128mb. 
either ati or nvidia will do just fine. 
and life goes on... jack 
evga nvidia geforce 6200 (it cost me $125) good luck. 
cluchetti p.s. i do not recommend ati!
