<s> hey there everyone!  </s>
<s> my wife and i recently moved from the u.s. to france and are now looking to get a multifunction printer/scanner to assist us with out work.  </s>
<s> since we are only here for two-years, we were hoping to get one that has a universal power supply, so that we can bring it back to the states with us.  </s>
<s> sadly, i may be using the wrong search criteria on the internet, since i cannot find any info on these.  </s>
<s> or, maybe they just don't exist.  </s>
<s> any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  </s>
<s> i looked at our hp c4780 all in one and the ac adapter shows 100 to 240vac and 50/60 hz. from what i know that is universal (actually terrestrial earth) so you may only need to look at the ac adapters and not the printers.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you can purchase universal conversion kits, most box stores have them, you shouldn't have to worry about swapping out the power inverter.  </s>
