<s> need some help on parts for a new system.  </s>
<s> i'll be buying the parts to put together myself or have someone do it for me. 1 - i will not be using the internet and don't need a modem.  </s>
<s> 2 - i will not be playing any games except &quot;chessmaster 10&quot; 3 - i will not be needing a serial or parallel port 4 - i will not be needing a floppy drive 5 - i do alot of dvd conversions to avi files 6 - i want to be able someday to watch blue ray movies on my system (i don't want the blue ray drive now however) 7 - i will not be a monitor at the moment 8 - i'd like to use the intel core 2 cpus.  </s>
<s> i'd like to start with the 8400 (45 nano) core 2 duo and someday move up to core 2 quad 9 - in a motherboard, i like it to support either the p35 or p45 chipset.  </s>
<s> i do believe both of these support the core 2 quad 45 nano.  </s>

<s> right now my amd xp system was built in 2002 and i think it's about time to get a new one - tks david  </s>
<s> you mentioned a lot of items so let's use that as fodder or base of a new system.  </s>
<s> 1. get the intel core 2 quad cpu.  </s>
<s> even the cheapest one will pay back in your video conversions and later the br playback.  </s>
<s> 2. video card should be able to handle blue ray and also have hdmi output.  </s>
<s> i like cards from this list -&gt; just go down the list till you find your hdmi output.  </s>
<s> beware that this does not mean you will be able to play bluray media onto hdtv.  </s>
<s> look up windvd and more to discover that it's sometimes an issue until you get all the software.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> nice input and i put to good use - david  </s>
