i am trying to decide between this two all in one's, and would appreciate if anyone that has either one of these products can give me there opinion. i am concerned with quality and how long the ink is used.
can only reply to cx8400 useage. print quality is excellent. cartridge life really sucks. i have never seen a printer use up ink as fast as this thing. wish i had never bought it.
thank's for the response, i finally bought the 8400 and dont have the same problem as you do with the ink usage
glad to hear that. perhaps i am doing something wrong that i can correct. been using epsons for so long though.
