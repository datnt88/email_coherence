<s> i was thinking of purchasing a netbook for my 9 year old to play internet based games from (gamesloth.com, miniclip.com,  </s>
<s> nick.com, etc) would the netbook support these ok?  </s>
<s> those flash games aren't so demanding.  </s>
<s> some remarks: - the screen size of a netbook is quite small - 600 x 800 pixels at most - this may be a limiting factor for some games - the small keyboard might be right for small 9-years hands - playing games often needs a mouse - the touchpad of an average laptop isn't nice for that; so preferably you use it sitting at a desk, and then you don't need a notebook or laptop so much - netbooks, like all laptops, have a rather limited lifetime and expensive batteries a cheap desktop might be a better solution.  </s>
<s> your choice, depending on your situation.  </s>

<s> sotnw. that ran on our acer aspire one netbook after i figured out how to pan and scroll so the screen would fit.  </s>
<s> so the kid was able to travel and game for cheap.  </s>
<s> later we picked up some under 400 buck toshiba 3gb ram, 160gb hd, celeron with the usual. the netbook was great training wheels so i could see what respect he would have for the real thing.  </s>
