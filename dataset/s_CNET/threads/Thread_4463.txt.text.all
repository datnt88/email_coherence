<s> ok, so i had a 2.4ghz cordless phone in my kitchen and then i went wireless and installed a di-614+ router in my living room.  </s>
<s> the problem that i'm having is simple.  </s>
<s> when using the cordless phone, i notice a pulsing sound in the background, which i'm sure is the routers signal.  </s>
<s> that i can deal with. the real concern here is that sometimes when the phone rings, i'll go to answer it and it won't pick up. is a 2.4ghz router supposed to work alongside a 2.4ghz phone (except for the pulsating noise)?  </s>
<s> should i consider paying more for a 5.8ghz phone or can i just get another 2.4 phone that isn't a piece of junk?  </s>
<s> not only your 2.4ghz phone but your microwave oven and any other toys operating in that range will cause interference.  </s>
<s> try relocating the router for one.  </s>
<s> if there is no improvement i would consider changing to a 802.11a/g(5ghz/2.4ghz range) router or change the frequency of the phone.  </s>
<s> i decided to go out and buy a new 5.8ghz phone.  </s>
<s> my router is rock solid and i have no problems with my internet connection  </s>
<s> dont even think about buying a new phone, your router most have a multi-channel selection on the 2.4ghz wavelength, try alternating between spectrum channels until you find the perfect one, example: my cordless phone use 2.4ghz and my wi-fi broadband router is set it up on 2.47 ghz  </s>
<s> how exactly do you do that?  </s>
<s> change the frequency of the router?  </s>
<s> enter your router's configuration menu (administration page).  </s>
<s> go to the wireless settings section.  </s>
<s> change the broadcast channel (frequency) to another one in the list.  </s>
