(ibook g4 running os x 10.3.9, netgear wireless g router, brother mfc 420cn networked printer, local brother hl-1435 laser printer and hp photopriner 1100+ using usb)

(also tried restarting computer.) deleting both printers and trying to reinstall one doesn't work, as printer setup utility no longer sees any usb drivers.
