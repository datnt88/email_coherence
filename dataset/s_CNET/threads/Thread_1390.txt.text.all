<s> when i bought my pc in may it played my dvd movies.  </s>
<s> then about 4 months later it stopped working.  </s>
<s> today i went round and round looking through the trouble shooting, windows media, power dvd and lite-on (dvd rw drive maker) and it seems the dvd decoder went 'poof'.  </s>
<s> i was at cyberlync (power dvd) and windows media trying to update or find a decoder.  </s>
<s> graphics card; visiontek ati radeon 1300 (installed today) os; windows xp sp2 media; windows media 10, power dvd 5 dvd; lite-on dvdrw sohw-1633s windows media player only has the option for cd audio under &quot;play dvd/cd&quot;.  </s>
<s> anyone have any idea where the decoder went?  </s>
<s> power dvd or &quot;other.&quot;  </s>
<s> check you cd software collection.  </s>

<s> hi, i use power dvd, it works well.  </s>
<s> but probably you have some programs data lost or corrupt?  </s>
<s> btw, check the dvd drive, it can be broken.  </s>
<s> the only cd that came with my emachines t6212 is the windows xp. i had &quot;interactual player&quot; on here and that would not play either so i figured the drive was bad.  </s>
<s> i forgot i bought a geek squad contract so i called them.  </s>
<s> they had me uninstall the dvdrw drive in the device manager and restart my computer.  </s>
<s> winxp detected it and reinstalled the drivers and now it works.  </s>
<s> thank you for your input.  </s>
