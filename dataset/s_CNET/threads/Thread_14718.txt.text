i recently got a compaq 5-button wireless mouse from my uncle. he didn't have the software but said i could get it off the internet. i downloaded the driver and installed. now the buttons on the new mouse work but when i try and move the cursor it won't register. also, the mouse wheel on my old mouse won't work anymore. what should i do? and where can i get drivers, i think this might not be the right one. thanks in advance.
it's an optical mouse, not one with the ball.
only install one mouse driver package. never 2. use system restore to go back. bob
