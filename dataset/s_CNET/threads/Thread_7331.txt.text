i recently bought a usb3 portable hdd. case. from my unscientific observation, it seem to me it is as fast as my esata hdd...it might even be slightly faster. i transferred 3.8gb video as a test and it took about 3 minutes, and my esata takes about 4 minutes. oh the usb3 case is connected to the usb2 port of the computer only. i didn't have a usb3 port to connect it to (another story for later).
i transferred a 2.44 gig file from my main box to both a usb 2 and an esata external. the esata transfer took about 21.5 seconds and the usb 2 was about a minute and a half. your 3.8 gig file is roughly 1/2 again as large as the one i used so my transfer of your file on my system would be roughly 33 seconds to the esata and 2 1/2 minutes to the usb2.
then i have. i was really looking to see if just the usb3 case alone would make a difference as i have experienced. my usb2 transfer rate usually ran about 2 minute per gb. it's a turtle compare to what you have.
and not the usb. your usb connection seems to be more consistent with my usb 2. in a sense, that might answer your own question. you are operating at usb 2 functionality but your esata is messed up. it should be much faster. i wonder if you don't suffer from that intel matrix storage manager issue.
