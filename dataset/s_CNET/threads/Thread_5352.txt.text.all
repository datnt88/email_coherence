<s> hi, i just bought a eee pc 1201t and was wondering a couple of things 1) why does it come without an os? is their a reason for this? could the drivers be un available for windows?  </s>
<s> or could asus be trying to pass more savings on to the coustmer?  </s>
<s> (another interesting thing is why it doesn't show op on their website) 2) how can you you install windows 7 without an optical drive?  </s>
<s> i have read some of the articles on how to do this but i have been unsuccessful.  </s>
<s> i know you must format the usb drive a special way using the command prompt but i am not sure about the rest.  </s>
<s> thanks, brian  </s>
<s> to cut costs, the responsibility to make the restore media is up to you.  </s>
<s> and to cut costs there is no cd/dvd drive.  </s>
<s> you have to decide if you will buy such now or later.  </s>
<s> nothing new here but i'm encountering folk that feel entitled to restore media and dvdrw drives for odd reasons like &quot;it should have come with it.&quot; bob  </s>
<s> i was asking why the netbook in question didn't come with an operating system.  </s>
<s> i can make restore media at a later time.  </s>
<s> my main concern is how to install the operating system on the netbook without a cd/dvd drive.  </s>
<s> to install the os we get a cd/dvd drive and use the restore media.  </s>
<s> but many feel this is not the answer.  </s>
<s> i can't understand why it is not.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> install the operating system from a usb hdd or flash drive?  </s>
<s> since we have a working install method why would we change that?  </s>
<s> you could try to create a new way then you could share how you did that.  </s>
