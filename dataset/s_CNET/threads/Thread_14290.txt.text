had to wipe & restore my main system hard drive and now cannot access my back up hard drive which has two partitions. running windows 98 se
test for access first by booting a windows 98 boot diskette which you make by downloading a boot disk from  if said drive was on the second ide channel (you didn't tell) then your new install of 98 may be unfinished. some require you install the motherboard drivers. bob
thanks, i'll try that. i also found something on wd's website about reinstalling an ez-bios overlay to get my slave drive recognized. thx, rick
if you used it, then the drives vanish when moved to other machines. if you can eventually remove ezdrive, you could save yourself a lot of grief later. bob
