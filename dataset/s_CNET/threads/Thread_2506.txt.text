i have a new monitor with dvi and vga connectors, so my mac and pc have direct connections to it, and i can use the monitor to switch back and forth however, my keyboard and mouse need to work with both also; they don't. i have a new kvm 4 port but that is not of any use. i just need to find a way to make my mouse/keyboard usb connectors work with eithr the mac or the pc. the monitor has many usb connections but this doesn't serve any purpose. i ahve a 4 port usb hub, that doesn't do anything either. thanks for your advice. jc
