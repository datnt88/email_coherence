four years ago or so i bought this system from newegg as a interim replacement pc: amd athlon ii x2 215(2.7ghz) 4gb ddr2 800 nvidia geforce g210 windows 7 home premium 64-bit i want to turn it into a htpc but i haven't tried this at all. i was looking to put a hauppauge wintv-hvr-2250 into the pc but i don't know if it will work. i have comcast cable and though one box is a dvr the other is not. while researching i've come across the fast that comcast may or may not broadcast in clear qam. though i have some idea, i guess i would like someone to clear all of this up. i usually put mid level gaming rigs together and have never done anything with a tv tuner in it. any help would be appreciated. more about : turning htpc
moved to all digital and almost no unencrypted channels. some were a bit upset about that but you can test that in nothing flat. what does the tv get without the cable box?
nothing, i need a special box to get anything.
they went all digital. my dvr and more dropped dead. bob
