what the best compurtor for making home video work apple or pc and what brand ? please help me ....
your post didn't detail much but only noted &quot;best&quot;. with no other criteria other than home user which means &quot;ease of use&quot; the cost factor can be ignored. i'd say apple's biggest and fastest intel based machine with final cut hd. bob
i have been using an e-machine t-3085 which is 2 years old. it has a 2.1 gz amd athlon xp-3000+ processor. i have added 512 ram (total 1 gz ram) and an ati-radeon all in wonder 9600 video card which comes with an analog connector for inputing analog sources (vhs video player). it has worked flawlessly while editing avi files over 8gb. a cheap system that has been very reliable.
