<s> i am a hospice chaplain and i am looking for a program and hardware to use to track my mileage and visitations.  </s>
<s> it needs to tell me where i've been, for how long and how many miles it took to get me there.  </s>
<s> i also want to be able to get directions to the addresses that i have to visit.  </s>
<s> i also want to be able to submit reports (mileage and visitation notes) to the home office via a laptop in my car (or from my house office).  </s>
<s> i also plan to use my computer to edit video and audio for worship services.  </s>
<s> i am curently usinf primere pro and sonar but could be convinced to make changes.  </s>
<s> can you help me decide what software and hardware to purchase?  </s>
<s> jonathan  </s>
<s> i waited for a while to see if anyone else would respond to your question, but i guess you will have to put up with me.  </s>
<s> so, a macpro laptop would suit your needs but if you need to do all that stuff in the vehicle you will need some sort of broadband wireless coverage.  </s>
<s> something like the service that cingular or verizon offers.  </s>
<s> tracking visits, mileage and times could easily be recorded on a spreadsheet.  </s>
<s> appleworks includes one but this is no longer bundled with a new mac. it is available as a separate purchase though.  </s>
<s> $75 (ish)excel is also a possibility, part of office 2004 for mac.  </s>
<s> (expensive) driving directions can be had at places like mapquest, on the internet, via your wireless broadband access and the safari web browser.  </s>
<s> for video and audio, the mac comes with ilife.  </s>
<s> a suite of integrated programs, itunes, iphoto, imovie(hd) and idvd that should suit your purpose.  </s>
<s> hope this helps p  </s>
<s> i would think that some sort of gps hardware/software combo would cover most of it.  </s>
<s> i have a hand-held garmin e-trex that does amazing things, and i've seen mac software for linking it to a computer in the ways you describe, but i've never tried it.  </s>
<s> on it's own, it will track 12 sats, is accurate to 7' on a good day, and 20' on a bad one.  </s>
<s> it has roadmaps of the usa, detailed enough that the cul de sac i live on is in it.  </s>
<s> it will store 250 waypoints (remember this spot) thousands of miles of tracks (how i got there) of course, it has a track back function.  </s>
<s> as a trip computer it will give constantly updated numbers for speed trip time moving time stopped time ave.  </s>
<s> moving speed overall average speed top speed eta ata distance made good distance to destination closing speed trip odometer altitude vertical speed time (accurate to 1/60th of a second, self setting) sunrise sunset gas stations etc etc etc. it runs on 2 aa batteries, or a cigarette plug.  </s>
<s> it's the size of an average cell phone.  </s>
<s> mine does not do addresses.  </s>
<s> others do.  </s>
<s> mine is 3 years old.  </s>
<s> the new ones have more features & better price, as you would expect.  </s>
<s> if it did addresses and the paperwork, it would be perfect for you, all by itself.  </s>
<s> i guess what i'm trying to say is that you need a gps that plugs into your laptop with some logging software.  </s>
<s> there are lot's of options & price points setting it up, but that's where my knowledge runs out.  </s>
<s> i can tell you that garmin makes good stuff (i've had three), and you can buy them at fry's, circuit city, best buy, etc. hope this helps, lampie the clown  </s>
