i have a dell 8300 2 years old. i can only boot into safe mode because i'm having xp home issues. i need to move important files (20gb worth - movies and mp3s) to something and i'm purchasing an external hard drive soon. question is, can i move those files to the external hd when i can only boot to safe mode? if so, how do i do that?
won't let you access your usb ports. unless you get xp working the best thing to do is put that hd in another system as a slave and do your file transfers from there. and life goes on... jack
i've been using a knoppix (google.com) boot cd and that let's me copy files out to fat32 formatted usb hard disks. bob
