<s> don't expect this printer to do too much as in printing reams of paper output.  </s>
<s> it does well, but as stated to you, brother gets it's hand again with toner costs.  </s>
<s> this is common for low-end or less expensive printers.  </s>
<s> plus, the 1st initial toner provided, may just be a &quot;starter&quot; toner cart, so once gain it'll be time to buy.  </s>
<s> however, i consider this a good bargain, but it seems if you wait or look around, other laser printers as just as cheap or available.  </s>
<s> it boils down to your needs as in what you expect from the printer, like connectivity, network, ease, costs, or paper selections, etc.. tada -----willy  </s>
