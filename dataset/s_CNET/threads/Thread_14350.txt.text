hi all, i need to use an ericsson 4425 voip phone over a cisco switched network. the switch i'm presently testing with is a catalyst 3550. i have created an access and a voice vlan for data and voice respectively... on the switch access port. although the traffic from the voip phone could have straightaway gone into the voice vlan in case of cisco phone ... with ericsson , it doesn't seem to be happening that way. the voip phone still takes an ip from the access vlan dhcp. pls suggest the ideal way to segreggate traffic into voice and access vlans at the ingress switchport.
i have the same problem help, plis!
changing the port that the new phone is in to the vlan for voice may help.
