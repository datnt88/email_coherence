hi everyone i need help with windows 98 during bootup. i'm sure many of you have had a black screen and curser blinking top left to the screen. i tried my f-keys and so on to no avail. all i want to do is go for a clean reinstall 98 from my cd. can anyone please walk me through the process. your help is appreciated. i head maybe booting up from cd drive in the bios? not sure. thanks christian
and the boot order available. in 98 most will use a 98 boot floppy, fdisk/format and install from their cd. some have a bootable 98 cd, in which case the boot order of the bios needs to reflect that choice of media.
thanks for the info. chris
thats the best advice i can give u
please don't post such silly remarks in the forum. people post here seeking help. they don't want to hear such as that.
