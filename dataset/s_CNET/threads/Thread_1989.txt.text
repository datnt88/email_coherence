my gateway desktop has a slot on the front labeled &quot;cf/microdrive&quot; is this slot a pcmcia or type ii connector? will a wireless card with a &quot;type ii laptop connector&quot; work in this slot?
just add in the model number so members can research that if you can't determine such at gateway.com btw, my belkin cf 802.11b wifi card had buggy windows 2000/xp drivers. they never issued a fix. so while it worked, it was not a solution i'd share with the market. bob
sorry, the pc is a gateway gt-4010 media center pc (desktop) running windows xp media center 2005 (rollup 2). the slot is a separate slot of the multi-format card reader.
but given my belkin cf card drivers were buggy i wouldn't count on it. why not use the usual usb wifi device? bob
