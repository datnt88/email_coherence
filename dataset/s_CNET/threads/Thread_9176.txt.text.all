<s> i currently have an hp computer with pentium 4 2.8 ghz processor and 1 gb ram.  </s>
<s> i'm looking at this computer - can someone tell me if will be faster?  </s>
<s> i know the processor speed is 2.5 instead of 2.8 but it is quad core.  </s>
<s> i don't want to purchase this if i'm not going to notice a difference in speed.  </s>
<s> thank you, linda  </s>
<s> i have the hp d4999t but with 4.0gb ram, some nvidia gt240 video card and well, it's very nice on windows 7. this looks to be twice the ram and a few steps back on the nvidia geforce g210 but that's quite a nice machine to have.  </s>
<s> just one note.  </s>
<s> be sure to create those recovery dvds as many forget and later they discover why we need those.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> so even though the processor speed is lower since it quad-core it should seem noticeably faster than what i currently have?  </s>
<s> i am not a gamer and am not concerned about the video card, too much.  </s>
<s> i've never had anything except integrated graphics (chip) and only have one program that i think would benefit from a better graphic card.  </s>
<s> my d4999t boots and does everything faster than my pentium 4 dual core machines.  </s>
<s> which are being cycled out.  </s>
<s> this new machine should run the sims 3 just dandy.  </s>
