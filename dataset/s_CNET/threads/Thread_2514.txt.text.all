<s> what do people think of the new area 51? sounds ludicrously powerful: microsoft operating system genuine windows 7 home premium 64bit- english 1.8gb nvidia geforce gtx260 graphics card memory 6gb 1066mhz (3x2gb) tri channel memory hard drive 640 gb serial ata non raid (7200 rpm) but would all applications/games etc work on the 64-bit windows?  </s>
<s> that's in the windows 7 forum so unless you have a specific title to explore the answer is that &quot;all applications/games etc&quot; will not &quot;work on the 64-bit windows&quot; but most of them will.  </s>
<s> will 99% be enough?  </s>
<s> thx, i know that you need a 64-bit driver for each piece of hardware, and the software/games have to be made compatible also.  </s>
<s> but it sounds like win7 is pretty compatible with older software so it should be ok i think (i'll check the microsoft page for updates) thx xmrb2003x  </s>
