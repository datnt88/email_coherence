(i am newbie to networking) i was trying to change my ip address to google's ip address but what happens is that i lose my net connectivity but after regaining the original ip adress i got connected,can anyone pls tell me logics behind these basic things. (used ifconfig p5p1 a.b.c.d to change ip address from fedora-gnome)
you should change your ip-adddres, but the ip-address of the dns-server. kees
is assigned by your isp. you cannot change it. you can change your lan ip address in your router but it will have no effect on the address from your isp.
@coryphaus but i was wondering that if the google.co. and my local pc's ip address are same how will isp differentiate between two same ips

need to go study how ip addresses really work, it is a fundamental design feature to solve this issue. the subnet mask is key. all devices know based on subnet masks which ip addresses reside on which networks. no matter what you change the isp router still knows. even if you did some hacking and managed to send data with a ip that is not yours the ( ie ipspoofing) most isp would detect this and drop those packets before anyone else sees them.
