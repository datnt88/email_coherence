<s> i bought a gateway laptop and i am wondering how to get wireless.  </s>
<s> i already have a few computers hooked up to a cable modem and and linskeys wired router.  </s>
<s> i have a wii and that runs wireless off of the linskeys router.  </s>
<s> is this all i need for the laptop?  </s>
<s> if your toys can connect wirelessly to the router your new computer should -- most new laptops come with wireless as standard.  </s>
<s> suggest you read the router manual and have a look at the networking setup in windows on the laptop and make sure the laptop's wireless switch (usually on the side of the case) is in the on position.  </s>
<s> if vista it should be pretty simple to connect.  </s>
<s> if so we have a note about this in our forum sticky.  </s>
<s> built in wireless?  </s>
<s> the yes or no answer will determine the solution.  </s>
<s> yes it is vista.  </s>
<s> (my first time using vista) yes the laptop does have built in wireless as far as i know.  </s>
<s> this is a link to the laptop.  </s>
