i wanted to buy a new 22&quot; widescreen monitor for my old dell dimension 2350. the monitor says its &quot;native&quot; in 1650x1080 i think, but on my graphics options thats not one of the screen resolutions. will i be able to use this monitor w/ my computer or will it be destorted? please somebody explain!
don't ask me how i know. is there an upgrade for the graphics card?
some require dual dvi connections and a nice video card. some require you install monitor.inf. check those instructions...
you problaly won't notice it..or at least you will get use to it (that's my guess).
