<s> hi everyone, i need to buy a graphic card for my pc, mainly to play video games. the problem i have is that the pc only has a pcie x1 and the card has to be low profile (i know that sucks ).  </s>
<s> i don't have a $$$ limit.  </s>
<s> so if you can please advice me on good graphic cards for this configuration, i would appreciate.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> the graphics library is more important than the card.  </s>
<s> learn this.  </s>
<s> if your system has a high end card and the library is medium grade, you're wasting money.  </s>
<s> ignore the firemv and quadro cards (all intended cad use), and you've only got the radeon x1300/x1550 to choose from.  </s>
<s> those are low-end cards.  </s>
<s> the real problem is the price... they're just not giving you $100 worth of performance and they're twice as expensive in the x1 low-profile form factor. for less than $100 you coud get a 'full size' 8600gt or radeon 2600xt that would be 2-3x faster than the x1300/x1550.  </s>
