<s> i'll be brief.  </s>
<s> i have an emachine t 6216 with stock 300 watt psu.  </s>
<s> want to upgrade psu.  </s>
<s> found out through e machine tech support that my stock psu has a 90 mm fan.  </s>
<s> i was going to purchase a new psu with a 120 mm fan.  </s>
<s> now, i find many fans at tigerdirect with 80 mm fans.  </s>
<s> will an 80 mm fan work for me?  </s>
<s> will a 120 mm fan work for me?  </s>
<s> what's the difference?  </s>
<s> also, i do not have a sata drive, but an ide based hard drive, will a new psu include a cable for an ide drive?  </s>
<s> would love some closure on these questions.  </s>
<s> thanks so much in advance, richard  </s>
<s> i too have an emachine.  </s>
<s> here's what i've learned: 1. the t-series emachines case is an odd size.  </s>
<s> &quot;generally&quot;, a regular atx power supply will fit.  </s>
<s> so look for just atx. the best thing to do is take some meaurements.  </s>
<s> 2. i purchased a rosewill 450watt with a 120mm fan from newegg awhile back. the larger fan moves the air alittle better.  </s>
<s> so, an 80mm or 120mm fan will work.  </s>
<s> doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> 3. other thing, i noticed you were looking at a very popular thermaltake powersupply.  </s>
<s> this powersupply is alittle longer than most atx power supplies and may not fit in your case.  </s>
<s> i barely had clearance for my rosewill when i installed it.  </s>
<s> so the best thing to do is to take some meaurements.  </s>
<s> chances are an atx powersupply will be alittle longer than you stock emachine unit, and the thermaltake will be even longer than that.  </s>
<s> 4. you may notice there are different pin types, either 20 or 24 pins.  </s>
<s> this is the connection that connects to your motherboard.  </s>
<s> most newer powersupplies will connect to both.  </s>
<s> these feature a 4 pin section that will detach from the connector, making it a 20 pin.  </s>
<s> so either way you're covered.  </s>
<s> 5. powersupplies will include connections for ide and sata drives.  </s>
<s> some are only ide, however rarely do you find those that are just sata.  </s>
<s> 6. if your buying a cheaper brand powersupply, like mine, do yourself a favor and buy a unit with more wattage than you need.  </s>
<s> most of these powersupplies are not making any where near the advertised power and all will deteriorate over time.  </s>
<s> i'd say buy an extra 100-200 watts of power, just for some headroom.  </s>
<s> 7. also another note on the cheapo supplies.  </s>
<s> if you plan on using a power hungry video card, make sure you buy 1 with a 12v rail and check the amps on the rail to the specifications of the vid card.  </s>
<s> that's about all.  </s>
<s> clear, crisp, and concise.  </s>
<s> brevity is genius.  </s>
