if i try to open task manager in xp i get a message saying &quot;task manager has been disabled by your administrator&quot;. i am the administrator, i also get a disabled message if i try to use regedit.
notes a common reason plus how to solve. bob
to enable your disabled task manager, try using free task manager fix tool. download it and click &quot; fix now &quot; and it's all you required for enabling the task manager.
