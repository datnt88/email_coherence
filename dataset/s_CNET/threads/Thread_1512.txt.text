i have some files (family videos) having close to 1gb. can you tell me if a dvd recorder (dobule layer) will be good? im worried if everybody will be able to see it. what is the best bet? adolfo
i'm currently using a 45 dollar teac all format dvd recorder. there is some issue that dvd players don't play recorded media, some will do dvd+r, some like dvd-r and some play both. i had to add a field to my contact list as to which type to send them! bob
thanks. sure a double layer is not needed for that file size, but since they are getting cheap, im planning to get them unless there are bigger problems with them. i mean, the only difference is the size of data that the disk will hold right? adolfo
but i expect you to find that sending a double layer to friends and family to result in a better than 50% reduction in who can play it in their dvd players. just my advice. buy the recorder if you want, but send out the single layer media... bob
you need a good media (use branded one)and a very good burning software. some softwares will not allow you to view the recorded clip in normal household dvd players while others have slides or errors in it. just an added information.
