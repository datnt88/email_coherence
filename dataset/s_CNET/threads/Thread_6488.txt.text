i was given an older gateway laptop with an orinoco wireless lan card built in. i have updated the driver so that i could use wpa. i have a belkin router g and a desktop and an ipod connected. i get great connection speeds with my other devices through my dsl connection, however, the gateway laptop is getting less than dial up speed (17k) i am sure it is some kind of setting/tweak. please provide me with any advice. thanks.
you gave the slim version of the details. first, is it setup per our forum sticky? some enable ap isolation, disable ssid, try mac filters and end up with slow speeds. sometimes its the firmware in the router or someone is running p2p on the other connection. the story is much too light here and i can't ask all the questions. let's let you tell more. bob
sure, the details are that i have no idea what mac filtering is, the ssid is enabled, and i have no idea what ap isolation is. the firmware in my router is current. the laptop has 512mb of memorty and an intel 4 m at 2.18ghz. the orinoco driver is updated and it shows connected as if it were 11mbps. additoinally, i cannot access the other computer on the network from that laptop. when it does appear, i get an erro stating that that computer is unaccessible and i may not have permissions. contact administrator. i am not a uber geek, please talk to me like i'm four.lol
that's right. mixed mode on the router can be fickle. but you didn't confirm if the setup was per our forum. no word about security, the channel you tried and the details. -&gt; if you don't want to know networking go find network magic (see google.com) it's very good for us that don't want to find why it didn't share. bob
