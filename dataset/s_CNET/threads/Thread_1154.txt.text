hi, i just to know if tv tuner cards can recieve cable channels or local channels only. also if the pick up uhf/vhf only ps i subscribe to verizon fios tv
sorry you'll have to use their receiver and it can emit a signal on channel 3 or component outputs. you will not be able to use your tuner with fios. bob
ok thanks, but how about outside my home or anywhere, how does a tv tuner card work?
sorry but i'm going to decline explaining how broadcast tv works. i hope you understand why. bob
i really don't, but you don't have to explain anyway, unless..........
until 2009 or so.
pick one that fits your needs.
good thing you said this, because i was about to get one sometime soon! damn fios ripping people off. you can't host a website on your personal server, you can't use a tv tuner card, all for a fortune a month.
