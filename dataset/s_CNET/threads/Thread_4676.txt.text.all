<s> hi, i have a seagate 2tb external hdd.it was running fine.but recently it starting to generate some clicking sounds when data is accessed(also takes a few seconds sometimes to access data).also when i turn of the pc its power is not down and i can still hear the sounds.  </s>

<s> since the exact model is not known i can't check if seagate has a power down feature in this model.  </s>
