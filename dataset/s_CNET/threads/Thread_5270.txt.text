cannot get computer to recognize new drive.. model ghe135c combo usb2.0.....firewire
read the long discussion at  also, there are some that don't support windows me or less. tell a lot about that host. bob
looks like this discussion has been dormant since 2004. my hd has worked well, with some minor os tweaks on a toshiba 1905 satellite for several years using the firewire port with xp sp2 os. now trying to get a new gateway laptop to recognize (running vista os)on gateway firewire port with no luck. have read the referenced link but does not appear to apply. open to suggestions. thanks!
mac? use firewire. linux? use either. microsoft didn't embrace firewire... bob
