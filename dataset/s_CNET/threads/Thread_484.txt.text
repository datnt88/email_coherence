i uninstalled this machine so i could fix my daughters x73, and when i clean uninstalled the x73 program and reinstalled the x1150 the scanner part refused to budge. i have unplugged, replugged, uninstalled and reinstalled. i have this problem into lexmark, but they have loads of problems before mine, so if anyone can help me, i would appreciate it. windows me 128 mgs ram thank you flora
uninstalled or unplugged? you don't uninstall the program to unplug the scanner. i assume you meant that you plugged it back into your pc, re-installed the software, and now it doesn't work?
you assume correctly. i'm sorry i confused you. i uninstalled the program and reinstalled it. i unplugged from the electrical outlet and then plugged it back in. i have tried everything that i have found when i searched &quot;google&quot; and the lexmark troubleshooting web site. thanks again flora
assumptions: trio= printer, copier, flatbed scanner. what os? xp? usb connection w/2.0 specifications. usb cable secure in trio and pc? lexmark program used to scan, control program to test scan? no yellow question marks in &quot;device manager&quot;? printer works ok? no error messages on program re-install? no double listing of trio in printers and &quot;add/remove programs&quot;? no error messages when scan of document attempted? power light on on trio?
i never uninstalled it from the &quot;add/remove program&quot;, just from the lexmark uninstall in the program files. everything is fine now thanks to you and cnet forums. thank you flora
