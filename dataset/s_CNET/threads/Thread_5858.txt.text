i am using now periform speccy now, i need another software. please thank you wendell
what specs are you looking for and why do you need other software than you are using now? kees
what is it that i bought, label and recite says somthing different than what periform speccy is telling me.
now you want a fourth and fifth and sixth? what are the differences in the reports by these 3 tools? and what make and model of disk are they reporting on? and let me repeat what i asked before. what characteristics of the drive do you want to know? kees
is it a sata 6 or sata 3, is it 32 mb or 145 mb i know it is a 300 gig 10,000 rpm velociraptor wd said know 145 mb the label states that it is 145 mb the serial # says 32 mb, periform speccy say some thing else. i purchased 32 mb fiirst confirmation says that 2nd confirmation says 145 mb. thats when i called western digital. and the seller.
then check the specs for that model number on the mfgs website. it will tell you all or almost all of what you want. from there you try hdtune ...its free on the web. vapcmd
i did that and western digital did that the serial # do not match the specs on the hard drive that was sent to me. the serial # matched on what i ordered not what was sent to me. i got two different statement confumation emails. before i opened up the hard drive plastic casing i called western digital because if it was not what i ordered i would have sent it back i do not care what is on the lable. the software puriform speccy says something way diferent. it is not oem i do not know what it is.the vender might have decieved me not the mfgs. thank you wendell
