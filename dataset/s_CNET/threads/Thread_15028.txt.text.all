<s> i recently tried a linksys usb adaptor w/ my desktop, but it must not have had a long enough range because it could not find the wireless connection that our city has now.  </s>
<s> what wireless adaptor would you recommend for my desktop that has a significant range so that i can get access from my home?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
