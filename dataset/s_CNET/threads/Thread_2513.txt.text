hi i have an office with 40 to 50 employees working with wireless connections. i have a d-link di-624 802.11g airplus xtreme g 108 mbps wireless router. recently, we've been having problems with random connection loses. one thing that i have experimented, is that if i have a pc that generates a lot of web requests it will make every pc in the office lose their connection. is there a business oriented wireless router that can be configured as easy as the d-link di-624. please no cisco solutions.
