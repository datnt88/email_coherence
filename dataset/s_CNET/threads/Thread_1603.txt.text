just got a brand new hp pavilian dv5 notebook. everything is fine. except i can hear clock ticking sound from hard drive constantly. it is not exactly one second per click, but very similar. when hard drive is working hard, it makes normal sound. when it is kind of idle, it is ticking. is this normal? thanks
i take it back. i thought when hard drive is working, there is no ticking sound. but i was wrong, i think it is still there, just that normal busy sound of hard drive seems overpowered that ticking sound.
and see if the sound is there. if not, continue to boot into safe mode and take a second listen. if the sound is only heard when windows fully loads, it's a background process accessing the hard drive. what process that is may not be simple to find. these aren't unusual. your computer just doesn't always sit there and wait for you to input something. it does stuff on it's own.
