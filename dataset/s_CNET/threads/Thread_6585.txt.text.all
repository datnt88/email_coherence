<s> i was wondering if u need a crossfire card and a regular x800 or x850 series card or can u just use a crossfire card and nothing else?cuz for nvidia u can use one card and later upgrade to sli  </s>
<s> with crossfire you can take any x850 and another x850 that is crossfire edition and the crossover and the special motherboard (this is key) aside the fact while dual x850xt pe's would provide a ton of powre consider a) nvidia and ati release new gpu's by july b) it still doesn't support sm 3.0, meaning 6800's can defeat it at that  </s>
<s> when do you expect ati to support sm 3.0?  </s>
<s> i thought x800 and x850 could be mixed... but i was wrong:(  </s>
<s> i meant can u use only 1 crossfire card and no need another x800 or x850 to go with it  </s>
