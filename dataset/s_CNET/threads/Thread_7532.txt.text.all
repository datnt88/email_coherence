<s> that the remote computer has sufficient security to disallow your entry.  </s>
<s> great tech at the other end.  </s>

<s> this identical thread in the xp forum has been locked i would think because it appears you want help to hack or spy on somebody else's computer, and cnet doesn't advocate this type of practice.  </s>
<s> so this thread will also be locked soon, giving you a chance to explain your actions before help will be given to you.  </s>
