situation: fresh install of windows 7 ultimate 64 bit new hardware: (cpu, motherboard, ram, gpu and psu) so i'm getting these squares (5mm x 5mm) scratchy looking artifacts on the desktop, sometimes they blink sometimes they dont. they vanish when i click around. weird, i can only get a screenshot when it happens to the desktop screen, when other apps are open and they come out and then &quot;print screen&quot;, they dont show up on paint. i then disabled the video card and use the mobo's integrated gpu instead. after obseving, the artifacts dont show up anymore. so i was certain i got a defective video card, and yes i managed to get it replaced by the vendor. after another session of formatting and reinstalling of win 7 and the new video card, they showed up again. so it wasnt video card after all. my new theory is that the video card (pcie) slot in the mobo is defective. is this possible. help me diagnose this. thanks
i first noticed the artifacts on the fresh install of win7, no graphics driver installed yet i then installed the driver that is included in the package of the gpu, artifacts show up i then installed latest driver, still artifacts show-up last test, i downloaded a trial version of win 7, still they show up. i'm at my wits end.
i did have this happen on a failing video card, however. the card had bad caps but even that could have been due to dragging down the ps. tell more about your hardware including the video card and ps wattage.
