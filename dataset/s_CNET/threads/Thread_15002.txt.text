i'm planning to add a dvd-rom to my new computer (it currently has a dvd/cd rw drive with light scribe). i've found numerous models (much cheaper than i ever could have imagined $17 to $25) but have no idea what i'm looking for or what names mean quality. some of the brands i've found are: benq, toshiba, lite-on, lg, samsung, sony, asus. can anyone recommend one of those brands over another? do the dvd-rom access times, cd-rom access times, and cache times mean a lot? for dvd-rom access times the one i like has 80-220ms but others have as low as a constant 90ms. for cd-rom access times the one i like as 165ms but others have as low as 95ms for cache the one i like has 512k but other have as much as 2m. thanks for your help. tbb
for $40 usd or less you can get a dual layer dvd+/-rw drive that will work with all major media types. the more cache the better. 2mb cache works great for me; i can't justify 2x-3x the $$ for 8mb. as for brands, i have had good experiences with nec and sony. my method:
i was looking at just a dvd-rom drive because i already have a dvd +/-rw drive in my computer and was told that there may be some conflict within the computer when trying to burn items because of having two different burners. do you feel that 512k of cache is too little? thanks for your help. tbb
512k is too little if you like speedy drives. get the 2mb cache drive. i don't have a problem with multiple dvd+/-rw drives. you just tell your burning software which drive to use when you go to burn discs--very easy. i think it is wise to purchase a second dvd burner instead of a read-only drive since your old drive will fail at some point (as all drives do), and the dual layer dvd burners are so inexpensive these days. nevertheless, the bottom line is always your budget.
