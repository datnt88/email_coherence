so, my printer just went out on me, and i really became dependent on my all-in-one, but if i'm gonna put out the money on a new one i would love to get one that will print directly onto my cd's and dvd's. does anyone know of an all-in-one with disc printing?
haven't seen one of those. printers print to paper. there are new burners that will print to the cd.
epson has three models i know of, ranging from $100 to about $400 (the latter also being a quality photo printer), but none of them are all-in-ones. i know of no other paper/disk printers at this time. you must realize that these will not print to ordinary disks, but only those with a special surface to receive and retain the ink. hope this helps frank
