is it possible to charge devices such as ipod, psp, and cell phones without having the pc on but still pluged into the pc? it has to be since computers at my school's computer lab is able to do this. i also read about self powered usb hubs could i plug my devices into it and be able to charge them with out having the computer on or having the hub not being pluged into the computer?
usb chargers satisfy your needs? pcs that will offer startup by mouse or kbd might do this but i've not seen that on usb. the current isn't generally sufficient for charging with the pc turned off.
i know that there are usb chargers but im just asking about if it was possible and if self powered usb hub could charge devices alone
you'd have to know their specs and test them. what you'd be looking for is how much current they offer versus a standard charger. as well, a good charger will sense the amount of current being drawn and adjust itself accordingly. usb attachment to a pc or non-dedicated charging device may work...or work somewhat...but this isn't a substitute for a proper charger.
if you read the usual usb spec, the power should be off until a pc commands the hub to power up. of course there may be a hub that doesn't meet the usb specs. because of this i picked up a wall mount usb charger. bob
i found a article on cnet that relates to it  i beileave something like this would charge independently?
why not get that? here's something similar to what i use:
google for &quot;charging station or dock&quot; should get you in the right direction. the key for your needs is the flexibility of various different connections and/or universal one if supplied(adapter?).  of course, if your university/school uses such, why not see what they use. you may find that such a station may offer to charge only similar same devices because so many devices get used and returned to be charged. tada -----willy
