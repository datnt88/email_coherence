3279	5	118734	1350055	1349946	aubrey online	8/9/05 4:29 pm	1.12360494e12	no pcie, i'll use onboard!	okay. asus pundit-r p4 tv tuner that's all i'm getting for now. then i can get a hold of 3.0 ghz intel, 1 gb ram and a big hdd. the case i have is too big, i'd like a nicer design. money wise it's good!
