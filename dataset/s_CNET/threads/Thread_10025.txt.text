my router is 3 com router 3crwdr100a-72. i reset the router but i didn't save the configuration, so it is not working. how can i retrieve the configuration ? (i restored it to the factory default) thanks in advance
that explains why you can't retreive it. -&gt; next? find who set it up the first time and this time write it down. bob
unfortunately the configuartion settings have been lost. factory reset literally clears all memeory out of the unit.
