<s> i accidentally posted this question in another thread and didn't know i had to create a new thread.  </s>
<s> sorry!  </s>
<s> anyways.....i have some basic questions concerning the wgr614v6.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> on the netgear router, is the internet symbol supposed to be on all the time and not flashing?  </s>
<s> im not really having any issues getting online, but i noticed that this symbol blinks rapidly all the time and does not stay constantly on.  </s>
<s> also, i just noticed my wireless logo is going in and out but im still connected and have not been dropped.  </s>
<s> it stays on when im not online, but when i open a web page it flickers as well.  </s>
<s> also another annoyance which the support people could not figure out is that im constantly at a good 60% connection.  </s>
<s> when i move around or switch rooms my signal does not move up or down the 60% connection.  </s>
<s> i can be inches away or yards away and it stays at the 60% mark.  </s>
<s> i have no cordless phones but i do have a baby monitor.  </s>
<s> however, i turned that off and im still at 60%.  </s>
<s> again i dont have any drop issues but would like to have the best possible connection.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> i use comcast and a d-link modem.  </s>
<s> lenovo 3000 n series notebook with intel centrino duo mobile technology vista business thanks.  </s>

<s> when you go to any website, the lights will blink on the router, this is normal.  </s>
<s> second thing, the wireless router you have, go to their website and download and install the latest firmware.  </s>
<s> most routers come with out dated firmware. the latest firmware helps to keep you connected.  </s>
<s> third thing, set up wpa security for your wireless router.  </s>
<s> this also helps to keep you connected and keeps leaches off your internet connection.  </s>
<s> rick  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply.  </s>
<s> i have the latest firmware my security is set up and pass protected just curious on how i can achieve a 100% strong signal.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> it's dead jim.  </s>
<s> read or you can skip to the end and read my advice.  </s>
<s> 1. use wpa 2. never disable ssid broadcast.  </s>
<s> about 100% links.  </s>
<s> so far there is no technology that does that except wired connections.  </s>
<s> it is normal to get less than 100%.  </s>
