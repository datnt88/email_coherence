'cpuz' is good at getting you that indo. vapcmd

2901	9	189697	2069174	2055306	dmdougherty	7/14/06 5:37 am	1.15285542e12	some things you can do...	some people have tried to give answers, but they've only hit a few things. i have a sony vaio laptap, 850 mhz w/ 20 gb hard drive. here are some things i would recommend: 1. memory upgrade. a memory upgrade is one of the cheapest things you can do. don't buy fast memory unless your computer can support it. if you put fast memory into a slow cpu bus, it will perform the same as memory matched to your cpu bus and you will have wasted your money. i would go up to 512 mb. make sure you know what kind of memory to get, and then buy it cheap on ebay or check pricegrabber.com or frugal goole and others. 2. scan for memory resident programs that install at startup and get rid of them. you can run a scan online at pcpitstop.com. they will run diagnostics on your computer and make recommendations based on what they found. under the windows section in the results, they will tell you all the processes that are running, which ones are needed, and which ones you would get better performance from by not having them start until you need them. 3. scan for viruses and spyware. others have suggested reformatting your hard drive. this is a long and time consuming way to get rid of spyware. a better way is to download spybot search and destroy from  . it is free and will detect and remove spyware. it also has a tool for controlling which programs run at startup. you can get free antivirus software from avast at  . 4. turn off any fancy feature settings in windows that give special effects - such as fading and shadowing. from windows xp (i think me is similar), you do this by right clicking on ''my computer'', select ''properties'', click the ''advanced'' tab, then click the ''settings'' button under ''performance''. you can de-select many special effects that eat up processor time. i usually leave only the ''smooth edges of screen fonts'' active. 5. as others have suggested, defragment your hard drive regularly. another trick is re-partition your hard drive into two drives, c: and d:. make the d: partition just big enough for your windows swap file (virtual memory) times two. for instance, i use a 1.5 gb swap file on a 3 gb partition. this keeps the swap file from causing your main drive c: from getting fragmented very quickly. the swap file can be managed by following the exact same steps in 4. above but then selecting the ''advanced'' tab and then the ''change'' button under the ''virtual memory'' section. you can tell what size you want for the paging file and where you want it to be. you can use partition magic (not free) to do this without having to reformat your whole hard disk. 6. run pcpitstop.com to find out how fast your hard disk is. if it is slower than 20 mb/s, then you can get an external usb hard disk that is 20 mb/s, which is faster than your internal disk. by getting and external disk, you can keep it when you do upgrade to a new computer. my old vaio actually has usb 1.01, which is only 1.5 mb/s. i added an external firewire hard disk and i get 18 mb/s. my internal hard disk is 13 mb/s. 7. pcpitstop has a nice little software package for a modest price called pc optimize that will check your registry and make tweaks that can improve your internet connection and computer's performance. so, here are 7 easy things you can do for very little extra cost. i still use my vaio 850 mhz as a nice little email, internet browsing, word processing, photo editing, and light use machine. it's not powerful enough to edit video or for gaming, but it's still very useful.

''back-to-school'' specials will be abundant very soon and you can get a great machine at a really good price. good luck!

2901	14	189697	2070886	2055306	rgakins	7/14/06 7:20 pm	1.1529048e12	speeding up a slow system- get away from me!!!	i don't know how much you can afford to do, but if there's any way you can, get rid of windows me. microsoft gave up on it a long time ago. people with windows 98 second edition are better off. if you could afford to buy a windows xp home upgrade version on ebay that would be the best route. i hope you are using the 30gb hard drive as your primary hard drive; if not, install the xp on it (using ntfs file system), install your applications, then copy your data from the 6.4gb drive onto the 30gb drive, then low level format the 6.4 and remove it from your system. your motherboard probably supports ata66 or ata100, and the 6.4gb drive only supports ata33, at best, and it's not going to give you optimal performance. make sure the cd-rom or cd-rw drive is on the secondary ide channel by itself, not sharing a cable with the hard drive. second, upgrade your memory to 512mb or more, preferably with matched memory (2 identical sticks of 256mb or 1 512mb)- you could start with 1 256mb stick and buy a second later if you buy a commonly available brand like crucial, kingston, pny, etc. third, buy a faster video card on ebay- your motherboard probably supports 4x agp so look for a 64mb or 128mb video card that goes up to 4x, which should be pretty inexpensive since most common video cards now are 8x agp or faster. if your board has integrated video, buy a fast pci video card of a model similar to the 4x agp cards you see on ebay, and disable the onboard video. lastly, if you have the money you might research your motherboard and upgrade the cpu to the fastest model supported. of course, if you're not a particularly diligent shopper, you can spend enough money doing these things to buy a new system, so do your homework and shop wisely.
2901	15	189697	2072110	2055306	drmicro	7/15/06 12:26 pm	1.15296636e12	simple way, small dollars and keeping me	while i agree with several of the comments advising you to replace your pc or upgrade to linux/windows xp, there are some things you can do to speed up your current machine without spending a lot of money and without changing your operating system. 1. you say you have 194mb memory. i'm guessing that either you have two sticks of ram, one 128mb and one 64mb or you have 32mb of shared memory for onboard video. if the former is true, replace the 64mb stick with either another 128mb stick or a 256mb stick, depending on your financial resources. whatever your configuration is, upgrading ram is the most economical &quot;bang for the buck&quot; you can do to improve your net performance. more ram is better, but whatever memory upgrade you decide to do, do not bother going over a total of 512mb as long as you're going to keep windows me. 2. since you have two physical hard drives, move your swap file (virtual memory) to your d:\ drive (assuming d: is your second hard drive. 3. create a d:\temp directory and modify your autoexec.bat file with the following statements: set temp=d:\temp set tmp=d:\temp 4. move your internet temporary internet files directory to d: 5. go into the control panel-add remove programs and remove any programs you don't need, plus any windows programs you don't use or need. 6. go to start-run, type msconfig, go to startup and disable any startup programs you don't really need to run automatically. examples include adobe speed launch, microsoft office startup, microsoft messenger, etc. all will run ok when you click their links, they just won't start quite as quickly, but if you don't use them, they're just sitting there, taking up system memory and cpu resources. reboot and check the box in the warning msg you'll get that says &quot;do not show this msg again&quot; (or something like that) 7. even though microsoft has officially ended support for windows 98 and me, you can still get all the available patches and security fixes. do not download any hardware updates unless you are having problems with your hardware. reboot even if they don't tell you to. 8. run scandisk and fix any problems it reports 9. defrag your c: and d: drives. 10. do a google search for regclean (free). download, install and run it. there are other registry cleaners, of course, and you are free to try any of them, but i'm trying to keep this as simple and low-cost as possible. run regclean and remember to make a backup of your current registry before you run it. reboot. that's about the end of free or low-cost things you can do to a winme system. windows me is probably one of the worst operating systems that microsoft came out with in recent recorded history, but if it's working for you, good. don't mess with it too much. lastly, in deference to some of the other posts, start saving your pennies for a new system. good luck!
2901	16	189697	2072722	2055306	candya	7/15/06 8:31 pm	1.15299546e12	*smiling* yet another person with this problem-been there.	when you are running a slower computer, with the smaller amount of ram you have to ask yourself a big question. faster old computer with older windows type that you cant even get updates for anymore. or have slower, small ram with a newer or newish windows? weird question right? not really if your stuck on cash your pretty much stuck. with the old geezer 95, and win 98 they dont need to much to boot up, wether it be processor speed or memory 95 and 98 take less also less hard drive space taken up. the newer the windows the more space it takes, and more speed and memory (ram) it needs to work. the bigger the hard drive the more it can store but with bigger hard drives it takes ages for a slow processor to do anything and even worse once the hard drive is full or semi full. it's amazing if your computer can get passed the windows startup. *smiles nice big grin* if you want something that works and can get past the money problem (now or in time) get yourself a nicer newer faster computer. heaven for me was a 1.?ghz processer with 80 gig... list goes on brand spankin new toshiba that just flew * (it was worth the wait it took to get the money for it) once windows start up screen came up a couple of enters and in 3 seconds flat i got threw the windows start up. dont have money? save up, forget about ur old stone aged computer (the more dough or things you put in it, it will be longer before you can afford a newer faster computer). if it takes to long, get a spare job *smiles* afterall you can try every trick in the book but the older the machine the slower the processor is. which altogether means *to slow to upgrade*
