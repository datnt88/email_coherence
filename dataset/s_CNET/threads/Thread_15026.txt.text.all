<s> hi everybody, is an ocz pc-3200 ddr400 value series 2gb (2x1024mb) dual channel kit (ocz4002048v3dc-k), with 3-3-3 timing, fast enough for running modern games such as fear?  </s>
<s> if i choose to use this ram, will i experience any lags, assuming i have an amd 4400 x2, and a 7800 gt oc. thanks in advance for trying to help  </s>
<s> so i'll just tell you what i see.  </s>
<s> if i auto config this mem it sets up to 3,3,3.  </s>
<s> using a mem tester i find that i can config this mem to 2,2,3 and it runs fine.  </s>
<s> i've run mem benchmarks both ways and darned if i can see a diff.  </s>
<s> has to do with latency, the first three does any way. the difference between 2 and 3 latency is 10 nano seconds.  </s>
<s> nano means one-billionth.  </s>
<s> bottom line, 3-3-3 is fine.  </s>
<s> cheers thanks for your input guys!!!  </s>
<s> as there are faster ones that are cheaper than that or at least 2x512 sticks.  </s>
<s> never the mfr's fastest memory.  </s>
<s> but a good performamnce to price ratio.  </s>
<s> but i think only benchmarks and maybe a gain of 5-10fps maximum is the difference you might get from the bottom of the barrell to the top.  </s>
