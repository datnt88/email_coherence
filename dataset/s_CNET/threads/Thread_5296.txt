5684	12	398277	3324316	3324145	7fred7	6/18/10 5:47 pm	1.27688322e12	integrated video	the major limitation of the integrated video is not the 250mb memory but the processing power - which will definitely not handle the latest games, nor a good many older ones. if the computer has an empty pcie slot, then you can add the video card of your choice at any time. there are just two things to check out: (1) is there room for the particular card you want? - some are quite long, (2) some high end cards draw a lot of power, so you should check that your power supply unit is adequate. i bought my computer with integrated graphics because the price was good. i used it for everything but games, no problem. several months later, i added an nvidia 9800gt card. this has been good for all the games i've thrown at it so far.
5684	13	398277	3324307	3324304	thljcl	6/18/10 5:54 pm	1.27688364e12	i almost certainly avoid integrated graphic card	when i got my hp pc back in 2004, it was shipped in intergrated graphic card. i didn't know the meaning of it. due to my own curiosity, i came to realize that having standalone graphic card is always better than having integrated one in term of performance. by having standalone graphic card, the burden of cpu and the amount of ram that has been used will be reduced. gpu will take over the graphic processiong job and there would be dedicated memory for graphic so that your ram could be used for other tasks. if you don't use your pc for resource-intensive job, integrated graphic card will just do fine. before running softwares, it's a good practice to check their system requirement. i'm not a hardcore gamer. but i do use autocad, adobe flash and photoshop. they do consume a lot of resources.
5684	14	398277	3324319	3324145	dokcal	6/18/10 5:56 pm	1.27688376e12	replacing integrated graphics	assuming that you're talking about a desktop pc (notebooks are another matter entirely), you can absolutely upgrade to a better video card later on. integrated graphics systems, with few exceptions, offer the bare minimum user experience. they're okay for most typical household tasks and internet browsing, and even for most business / office uses, but for an enjoyable multimedia or gaming experience, you're probably going to want to upgrade to a faster card. fortunately, all desktop systems include several expansion slots that can accommodate additional cards, including one or two designed specifically for graphics cards. in new machines, this will be a pci-express slot. don't get suckered into buying an outdated machine with an agp slot instead! agp is an older technology on its way out, and graphics cards that fit that standard are older, slower and harder to come by. if and when you do install a new graphics card, you can disable the integrated graphics in the computer's bios. even if bios-tweaking is beyond you, most computer systems will automatically detect the new card and direct resources to it instead. (by the way, 256mb isn't all that much memory when you're talking about today's games, much less tomorrow's! plus, that's 256mb of shared memory, which means the graphics system doesn't have any memory of its own; it's borrowing from the system ram to store all of its texture information. this is a very slow way of doing things, even with fast system ram!)
5684	15	398277	3324310	3324145	swamphawks	6/18/10 6:03 pm	1.27688418e12	really depends on the specific games you might like to play	you haven't told us much about that hp system that interests you, but i'm going to assume that the &quot;integrated graphics&quot; you are talking about comes in the form of the intel q57 express chipset that of late is being put on motherboards intended for use with core i3 and i5 processors. 256k video memory, shared at that, is not really all that much - at all. the serious gamer cards lately come with 1-2gb of specialized graphics-oriented silicon onboard (&quot;gddrx&quot;), but will also cost you typically $100-400 extra, with exceptions on either end of that range. all reviews i have seen say the newest intel integrated graphics will play blu-ray just fine, but only fairly rudimentary games; but also in fairness that intel never claims it'll do more than that. using integrated graphics for mostly playback entertainment should be fine. but if you want to play any kind of graphics-demanding game, you'd better figure on an add-on graphics card. and unless they are the most demanding games, you should be able to get a very respectable card for under $200. you just have to be clear with yourself about what you really want to do with the box, and be prepared to pay for whatever that is. i recently bought a very current nvdia 220-based card with 1bg onboard for $65 which handles middle-of-the-road graphics demands pretty well, so the extra card doesn't have to break the bank. if you've not looked in a while, prices for graphics cards are down significantly in terms of bang for the buck. just be clear about what you want from your system, and keep in mind that you can always add one in later if the rest of your system can handle the extra demands of higher-end gaming - it's not just the card that matters.

(data to and from the graphics processor.) 2) the power supply for machines like that are very minimal. often 300 watts or so. a decent video card will want maybe a 600 watt. higher if you go with more powerful cards. look for sli, or crossfire rated power supplies of 750 watt minimum if you go with a really powerful card. this also gets you extra power connectors to connect directly to the video card. (some require 2 now) by the way, this is also true for laptops. lots of them are very cheap now days, and sound very fast. don't be fooled by them. they talk about their processor, and that is the lesser requirement for games. i would take a core 2 duo processor laptop with a discrete video any day over a core i7 laptop with integrated video.

5684	86	398277	3326196	3324297	alswilling	6/22/10 2:15 am	1.2771729e12	it apparently depends on the hp model	first of all, all hp computers have integrated graphics that use system ram instead of having their own memory. also, if you install a graphics card, you cannot run both the integrated graphics and the pci card. after installing the pci card, you have to go into the device manager and disable the integrated graphics, otherwise all sorts of weird things will happen. after installing the card and its drivers, and before disabling the integrated graphics, you will have to shut down the computer, disconnect the monitor from the integrated graphics' connector, and connect it to the connector on the new card. then boot into windows and disable the integrated graphics in the device manager and reboot. regarding alang59's post, i have an hp computer, too; but i didn't encounter the problems that alang59 encountered except the need for a more powerful graphics card with its own gpu and memory. i do a lot of graphics work, including video editing and compilations, so the integrated graphics were inadequate. it's true that hp only uses integrated graphics that meet the needs of the software and hardware that come with the machine. if you need more graphics rendering capability, then you will have to add a graphics card. to solve my problem, i bought a new nvidia graphics card. when i opened the computer's case, i found that i had two empty pci slots. it was a simple matter of installing the drivers and graphics card, connecting the monitor to the new card, and disabling the integrated graphics. the only problem i have had related to the new graphics card was when i installed linux in a dual boot configuration. i could not get the nvidia card to work with linux, no matter what i did. nvidia did not have linux drivers for my card, and the application that is supposed to allow linux to use the windows drivers did not work. all i got was a black screen. it was either uninstall linux or uninstall the nvidia graphics card. i opted to uninstall linux rather than give up the improved graphics that i had gained from the new graphics card. so, if you buy an hp computer and you are going to be playing graphics intense games, then you may as well include the price of a good graphics card. the user manual should give you the specs for the computer, including the total number of pci slots and the number of pci slots that are free (as in not being used). also, a glance at the back of the tower will be an indicator. the number of blank pci card knock-outs will usually be the same as the number of available pci slots. you can also go to hp's web site before you buy the machine and look up the specs for the computer you are thinking of buying.

(you cannot buy graphics memory like an ordinary ram, you need to get a new card with more memory. so you may have to remove one to use the other and its expensive too). i suggest you ask your dealer regarding this. for a good gaming experience, i recommend a pc with a nvidia or ati graphics card with atleast 512 mb of ram. visit  and  for info regarding the price and features of the graphic cards. also, don't forget to ask your dealer regarding the provision in the motherboard. i hope you find this useful.

(except memory) i'm not sure that it's true with all acer computers, and i don't know why they do it that way. it seems to me that it would be easier just to assemble parts, and let it go at that. in the final analysis, make sure you contact the compuer manufacturer, (not always the easiest thing to do) and find out if the computer you are interested in is upgradeable, and what components or all components are upgradeable. now acer does have a good customer service website, so i've not had a problem adding on some components that hang on outside the computer. after five years it still works fine, but it does have its problems occassionally. like not wanting to turn on at times.

5684	120	398277	3328552	3324145	dukethepcdr	6/26/10 5:58 am	1.27753188e12	you'll regret getting the computer for more reasons	first of all, i recommend considering a different computer altogether. hp computers have a long and sad history of poor tech support, underpowered components and poor performance. i would recommend looking at better computers like dell, acer or even gateway (which is not a lot better than hp/compaq but at least has decent customer service). i also recommend not buying computers from deep discount places like costco. with a few exceptions, the people who work in those places know nothing about computers and cannot answer your questions. also, they do not have any good computer repair nor maintenance services. i'd recommend getting your computer from places like best buy, frys or even better yet, a shop that sells nothing but computers. check to see if your town has any specialty shops that only sell computers. the more specialized a shop is, the better their service and support after the sale tends to be. sure it may cost a bit more at the outset, but at least you'll have some support for your computer after the sale. getting a computer is kind of like getting a car, any after the sale customer service the place you get it from offers is very important because, trust me, you will have issues with any computer you get sooner or later just like we do with the cars we buy. really, the kind of graphics card that any desktop computer comes with is irrelevant because they are almost always way underpowered for playing video games. you have to get one of those specialty brand towers from companies like alienware or ibuypower to get a good &quot;out of the box&quot; gaming experience. what does matter when buying a computer (as far as graphics goes) is how many expansion card slots the computer's motherboard comes with and what kind they are. look for computers with at least one pci express (aka pcie) slot. that is where you'll put your more powerful graphics card that you'll buy separately. what also matters when getting a computer that will run a good video card is cooling. find a computer with the largest vents in the front of the case that you can. if you can find one that also has a vent in the side and even better, on the top of the case that is even better. if there are no fans in these vents, that is okay because it is easy to install fans in those vents later. good performing video cards get hotter than weak cards and need good ventilation to perform properly. when you get your separate video card, connect your computer to the internet and download the newest drivers for whatever video card you buy separately. usually, you can do a search for the name of the graphics chip maker (usually either ati or nvidia). if you get an ati card, you'll end up on the amd website since they are the parent company of ati now. do a search within that website for the model of video card you bought and download but do not install the drivers for it yet. just save the file folder to your desktop or downloads folder so you can find it again. before you install the drivers, click on start then control panel then device manager. scroll down the list of devices until you find the integrated video card. right click on the name of the card and click on &quot;disable&quot;. once you have the integrated graphics card disabled, shut down the computer completely and unplug it. put on an antistatic wrist strap (most computer stores sell them for around $15 or less. they keep you from frying your new computer with static shock and are well worth getting) before you open up your computer. set it down on a flat, hard, clean surface like a table. open up the box that the separate video card came in and remove the card from the package. do not touch the gold-like connectors on the bottom of the card as oils from your skin can damage them. also avoid putting any pressure on the cooling fan (if the card has one)as you could damage the motor. you'll probably have to remove a panel or two from the back of the computer tower so that the video ports are visible from the back of the tower (speaking of video ports, most of today's video cards come with dvi ports which are usually white and have slots running both vertically and horizontally. if your monitor is older than two or three years, it probably has a vga plug on it (usually blue and with a bunch of round pins in it). if the card doesn't come with an adapter, you'll need a vga to dvi adapter for older monitors. when putting the video card into the computer, make sure there are no wires in the way of the slot before you push it down in there. also check to see if the card requires additional power. there will be a port usually on the short side of the card opposite the side with the monitor ports where you'll plug this power cable into. if the power supply that came with the computer is powerful enough, it should have a cord for this port. if not, you'll need to buy a different power supply that has cords for video cards on it. most of the power supplies that are 300 watts or more these days come with the needed cords. install the more powerful power supply (if needed) first before you install the graphics card. be sure to push the video card into the slot until it clicks (there is usually a lock of some kind to keep the card from wiggling loose on most motherboards these days). also be sure to screw the card's metal retaining bracket to the case frame to help support it. when you put the case's door back on (never run a computer with the case door off as it defeats the cooling system of the case and leads to overheating), plug in and restart the computer. when windows tries to reinstall the pc's integrated graphics card, click on &quot;cancel&quot;. if you don't click on cancel in time, disable the integrated card again as described above. now, find the driver you downloaded and install it. you'll probably have to restart the computer to finish the install. also, don't buy a desktop pc that is smaller than &quot;mid tower&quot; size. avoid the ones that are thin and that lay on their longest side. avoid the ones that are shorter than most of the other ones too. those &quot;space saving&quot; form factors are really hard to find graphics cards for. they take the shorter cards which are usually pci or even agp rather than the faster pci express cards. i found this out the hard way by buying a sony &quot;micro tower&quot; pc a few years ago. the case looked cool, but by being a few inches shorter than the typical mid tower size, i had to settle for getting an nvidia card that used an agp slot. those older tech cards are not as fast nor able to render graphics of today's games as well as those that use the pci express slot. another important thing to consider when buying a computer that you might play today's games on is even more overlooked than the included graphics: the power supply. most pc makers skimp on parts as much as they can to make a bigger profit. one of the ways they do this is by putting the lowest power of power supply in the tower that they can get away with. if you are getting a video card separately from the pc (which anyone wanting to play anything more advanced than online browser games should do), then you'll need a higher wattage of powersupply than what your computer comes with. most decent video cards require at least a 300 watt powersupply, but check the box of the video card you are thinking of getting to make sure. considering all the other stuff your computer will be powering, i always up the wattage of a power supply that i include in a computer by two or three hundred watts over what the video card requires. you mentioned thinking that 256 mb memory for a graphics card was &quot;pretty hefty&quot;. it used to be, but not any more. today's video games have such advanced graphics that you'll actually get fairly poor performance from a 256 mb card with most of them. i'd recommend getting a video card with at least 512 mb of ddr ram. if you can afford it, go for one with 512 of ddr2 ram as ddr2 is even faster than ddr. stay away from video cards made by anybody other than the actual graphics chip makers. sure they are a bit cheaper, but there is usually a reason for that. the cards that are not made by either nvidia or ati do not seem to last as long and they tend to have poorer tech support and not as user friendly interfaces for their software. with graphics cards, you really do get what you pay for. one of the best &quot;bang for your buck&quot; video cards on the market today is the nvidia geforce 8700. it makes use of direct x 10 and has all the processing power needed to run the latest games. yet it is no longer the very newest card out there, making it more affordable than the newer cards like the nvidia 9000 series. finally, no matter what computer you get, keep it clean. at least once a year (once a month if you have pets, smoke and/or are using the computer in a dusty environment) open up the case and blow out the dust, hair etc with canned air. you might even need to put on your anti-static wrist strap mentioned above and take a cotton swab (qtip) dipped in rubbing alcohol (never use any other liquid inside a computer)and wipe off some of the more stubborn stuff. you'll need to remove the front panel to really get all of the stuff out at least every other cleaning if you do it monthly. computers draw in air from the front and blow it out the back to cool themselves. there is all kinds of dust, pollen, hair etc floating in the air. when this air gets sucked into the computer, that stuff settles out of the air and sticks to the parts inside the computer. over time, the stuff builds up and insulates the parts, keeping them from cooling off properly. when computers act 'slower' than they used to and especially when they shut off for no apparent reason, it's very often due to the fact that the computer's parts are getting too hot. your new computer will last longer and run faster if you keep it clean. just some tips from someone who has built several pcs and upgraded the graphics of hundreds of pcs.

5684	139	398277	3329461	3324145	bill3333	6/28/10 12:05 am	1.2776835e12	from my manuals - mobo integrated graphics	motherboards tips for judging quality hardware secrets feb 12, 2010 gabriel torres is the editor-in-chief of hardware secrets, a us-based website about pc hardware with more and more components being integrated inside the computer cpu, the motherboard doesnt affect the system performance as much as it used to just a few years ago. so what makes a given motherboard a good motherboard? there are features, of course. the number of memory sockets, the number of expansion slots, the support for sli and crossfire configurations, the number of sata ports, the presence of esata ports, the number of usb ports, the presence of digital audio outputs (spdif), raid support, overclocking options and, especially right now, the presence of new technologies such as sata-600 (a.k.a. sata 6 g) and usb 3.0. but if you are buying a motherboard and find two or more products with similar features, which one you should buy? one answer might be the one with the best quality. but how can you tell the quality of a motherboard? there are a few small details on motherboards that reveal a lot about their overall quality. the first one is the quality of the electrolytic capacitors that are used on the motherboard. many years ago some manufacturers used low-cost capacitors that leaked after some time, leading the computer to behave erratically and even damage the motherboard. since then, several manufacturers started using capacitors that are immune to such leakage. one of the best kind of capacitor uses polymer type, also known as solid. they are easy to spot: the look like small aluminum cans. then the second best are the ones manufactured in japan (brands include nihon chemi-con, rubycon, sanyo, matsushita/panasonic, and hitachi). the second clue to quality is the kind of chokes (coils) used on the voltage regulator circuit (which is located close to the cpu socket). these chokes can use ferrite or iron in their core. both are squared components measuring approximately 3/8 x 3/8 (1 cm x 1 cm), but ferrite chokes are closed while iron chokes are opened. so if you see a bunch of gray or black square components near the cpu socket without a coil inside of it showing up you are seeing a ferrite choke, otherwise you are facing an iron choke. ferrite chokes are better than iron chokes. then we have the number of phases of the voltage regulator circuit (think of a phase as being like a piston in a car engine). the more phases the voltage regulator has, the better, because each transistor present on this circuit will work less, thus producing less heat. the less heat your motherboard produces, the better for its life-span and of course temperature inside the computer. a high number of phases also increases the motherboard efficiency, i.e. it consumes less energy. but how can you tell the number of phases from a motherboard? by counting the number of chokes available: each choke is connected to one phase. however, current cpus require several voltages to work, so the voltage regulator circuit will have separated phases for each voltage. for instance, on motherboards designed for cpus with integrated memory controllers (all amd cpus and core i3, core i5 and core i7 from intel), the voltage regulator will produce two distinct voltages, one for the cpu core and another one for the memory controller. in this case the motherboard manufacturer may say that the voltage regulator circuit is, for example, a 6+2 design, meaning six phases for the cpu core and two phases for the integrated memory controller. motherboards targeted to the new intel cpus with integrated video controller need to produce three different voltages, the third one being to the cpu integrated video processor, so manufacturers announce the voltage regulator circuit like 6+1+1. so when comparing motherboards, you should buy the one with more phases. some manufacturers, however, use a higher switching frequency on their voltage regulator circuit, what makes one phase to be more efficient than several phases from competing products. manufacturers that offer this kind of solution on their products advertise this very clearly on the product specs page. motherboards - do not have on board graphics - by bill3 a very simple way of getting a good motherboard for a novice, is stick to asus and gigabyte, ( others are good too ), who have very good reputations for quality, win many awards for excellence, and you can clearly see the evidence of this tutorial, when examining their boards. of course, the more you pay the better you get. my personal recommendation is never, never, never have on board graphics, because : - 1 graphics are very highly sophisticated, expensive, and stressed section of a computer. 2 if on board graphics die, they can kill the motherboard too, so your in for a complete rebuild. 3 on board graphics only come on cheap motherboards. 4 on board graphics consume much expense in the construction, so both the motherboard itself, and the graphics, have to be made cheap and nasty. 5 with no graphics, manufacturers charge from nearly double for their motherboards, so this must really show that there is a whole lot more to a good motherboard. 6 computers with separate graphics cards always have a much nicer picture for xp. 7 computers with separate graphics cards always have a much nicer picture for games, and more of them will run on your computer. 8 with a separate graphics card, you can remove and upgrade it, to run a higher specification game. however, if on board graphics die, you can put a graphics card in, and usually get the computer working again. also, there are heaps of people, who just want a cheap, reasonable computer, and they run just fine with on board graphics, but not with the same performance as the separate graphics card computers.
