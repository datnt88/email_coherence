i've been tasked with giving users in our main office the ability to print to our other buildings. right now the external offices connect via citrix to access our database and files, but i'm assuming i want to leave citrix out of this. the external offices already have a static ip address for the cable internet connection and the printer is connected to the router in that external office. i'm having a difficult time finding solutions online. what do i need? print servers at the external locations? some sort of vpn voodoo? any assistance would be greatly appreciated. this is an all windows environment, all workstations are xp and the servers at the main office are windows server 2000 (for citrix) and server 2003 for everything else.
it seemed like magic to some but we had no interest in putting a printer on a print server or &quot;share&quot; or other solution because the printer drivers would kill our support staff and budget. here's how we solved it. we created a network share and if you put a .pdf file there it gets printed then deleted from that directory. this is not an offer to write in detail about the batch file that runs this print job but to share we knew the pitfalls of attempting a printer share. bob
what i did to enable this was installed the printer at each external office as a network printer (via ethernet cable to the router). then i went into the router settings and set up port forwarding for port 9100 to go to the printer's ip address. from my main office i used the add printer wizard, selected local printer, created a tcp/ip port, and put in the static ip address for the external office. i had to have the drivers at the main office to install them easily. this works fine now.
