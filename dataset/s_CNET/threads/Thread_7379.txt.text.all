<s> i am about to purchase a new computer proably the cyberpower gamer ultra sli pro. the system comes configured with 2 new!!! nvidia geforce 8800 gts 320mb 16x pci express graphics cards (major brand powered by nvidia) and a standard case power supply.  </s>
<s> however a 500w power supply is recommended for using dual 7900 and x1950 or above video cards.  </s>
<s> should i stay with the standard case power supply or should i upgrade to 500w [for +$49], 600w [+79], or even a 700w (quad sli ready) [+146]?  </s>
<s> i have more of the specs right here: - free!  </s>

<s> thank-you  </s>
<s> i like having the extra 100 watts because the electrolytic capacitors degrade pretty fast in the first 2 years.  </s>
<s> it's a cheap thing to add the extra 100 watt capability and saves headaches later.  </s>

<s> there's more than 1 am2 4400.  </s>
<s> and for a few more bucks, you can get a 4800 (2.5ghz) vapcmd  </s>
<s> i'm getting a (socket am2) amd athlon64 x2 4400+ dual-core cpu w/ hypertransport technology and i do not plan on upgrading cpu.  </s>
<s> if you had a power supply just big enough, it would have an issue in about a year.  </s>
<s> that's why we move up the the next size.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> as previously indicated .... amd has many cpus...case in point there are two am2 x2 4400s ... which one comes with your system ?  </s>
<s> the 89w or 65w cpu ?  </s>
<s> or the 65nm or 90nm technology ?  </s>
<s> 2200mhz or 2300mhz ?  </s>
<s> 2mb cache or 1mb cache ? the other point is you should ask to find out how much more for a 4800 or 5000.  </s>
<s> it's often the case you can upgrade to a faster cpu for only a few bucks more than the one you're buying.  </s>
<s> can't figure why you're putting such a low-end cpu in an otherwise high-end system ?  </s>

<s> i am getting the (socket am2) amd athlon64 x2 4400+ dual-core cpu w/ hypertransport technology.  </s>
<s> you can see more specs @ .  </s>
<s> no i am not changing my cpu.  </s>
<s> i just need to know what power supply i should get.  </s>
<s> you'd know exactly what is was you were getting (paying for) and that there were cpu options that better matched your system without spending much more.  </s>
<s> but since you're not interested in knowing more or scoping out better options...i'll leave you to your power supply.  </s>
