<s> hello, i am a student in a high school engineering course and our goal this year to is invent a new product or innovate/improve an existing product.  </s>
<s> my group's idea is a laptop case that will feature an integrated cooling pad that would drastically increase the portability of cooling pads, as a product like ours does not exist at the current time. the cooling pad would flip out of the case and rest on top of it (propped up a little bit with feet on the bottom of the pad), providing the user with a comfortable way to use the cooling pad.  </s>
<s> ideally, the pad would be powered by usb, although we are considering also implementing a rechargeable battery so that the user wouldn't have to drain their laptop battery.  </s>
<s> so that leads us to my questions.  </s>
<s> do any laptop experts or portable device aficionados have feedback or suggestions to make on this idea?  </s>
<s> also, what do you think are the most important criteria are in the creation and feasibility of this product are, and the success of it in the long run?  </s>
<s> thanks so much for your time and any feedback that you are willing to provide!  </s>
<s> i'd think a flip out cooling pad that rests on the laptop case with the laptop on top if it is going to both raise the height considerably and take away that firm surface that keyboards need.  </s>
<s> unless this is a hard case item.  </s>
<s> as well, i'm not convinced that usb cooling is going to work if the power source is the laptop.  </s>
<s> consider that you're using energy from the laptop which generates heat.  </s>
<s> then you're trying to cool the laptop with some fan connected to it?  </s>
<s> this does not make thermodynamic sense to me.  </s>
<s> as the ultrabooks roll out what you are asking for looks to be like a new design of the buggy whip.  </s>
