hi, im a newbie to this forum and am wondering if anyone could recommend suggestions for a computer which is capable of using cad software and rendering......... can anyone suggest a computer regards a
find your favorite cad and rendering software and see what it minimum and recommended system requirements are. if you go (somewhat) above the recommended requirements you should be ok. the higher you go, the faster it will be, of course, but there certainly is an area of diminishing returns (or: a smaller outcome of value/money). things that probably matter: - cpu speed and number of cores - 32 or 64 bit os - graphic card - amount of ram - windows or apple or linux kees
today's common hardware is lightyears ahead of what we used in 2000. i can't imagine how you could be unhappy with current machines with dual core cpus 2+gb ram and more. bob
at work i have a amd 3800 2.4ghz, 1gb ram and integrated graphics card and can run autocad 2000i easily. it hiccups a bit with autocad 2008 tho this is 2d work only, cant comment on 3d work
i generally use solidworks 2008, pro engineer wildfire 4 and 3ds max and rendering time is usually an issue...........
about the system requirements of these programs? kees

just fit the supported video card and go.
