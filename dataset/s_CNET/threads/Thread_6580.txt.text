has anyone found a places that sells spare parts for external hard drives? i have a western digital passport that i think still works but the circuit board that has the port might be toast. i'm wondering that is a piece i can buy from somewhere.
if not still under warranty, just get another enclosure..maybe one with esata too. vapcmd
and are you 100% certain that will fix the problem. i would say a better solution is to get another external enclosure. just my 2 cents.
