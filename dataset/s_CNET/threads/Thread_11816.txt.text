hi i have just purchased a cpu and its an intel pentium 4 cpu 3ghz/1m/800 sl8hz skt 775.not being technically minded i would like to ask what do all the numbers stand for? can any one recommend a good motherboard that i can put this cpu on.i am just in the process of building up a desktop pc. thanks
re finding a motherboard, ram, etc.,  newegg.com is one of the easier sites to find parts by category or type...i.e. motherboards, intel, socket 775....the list will be nearly endless. filter the list by 'best rating'. vapcmd
you have a p-4 hyperthread, socket 775. as far as motherboards go, the prior poster listed new egg, good choice. good motherboards to look at, msi and or gigabyte in socket 775. use at least 1 gb of ram, preferably 2 or even 3 and you have a start to a very decent hook up. good luck and have fun!
thank you for your comments it was most helpful
