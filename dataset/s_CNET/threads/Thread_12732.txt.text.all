<s> hello.i am new to this so please bare with me.i just bought a new desktop that has the nvidia geforce 6150 se integrated graphics card.it has a open slot for a pci-e card.can the integrated card be upgraded?  </s>
<s> or will this card work for gaming?  </s>
<s> you can buy a pci-express card and set it as the primary card in the bios, so that the pc will prefer the pci-e card as its video output.  </s>
<s> a 6150 will &quot;work&quot; for gaming, but is not the best choice given the plethora of cheap cards on the market that will easily outperform low-end cards from the past.  </s>
<s> - vr/z..&gt;&gt;  </s>
<s> thanks!!  </s>
<s> power from the psu.  </s>
<s> so make sure you check the video card power requirements before making the final purchase.  </s>
<s> otherwise you might end up forking up another $50 to $100 for a new power supply too.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
