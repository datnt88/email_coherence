i have a router d-link desktop and tablet, both have windows xp. and firewalled. desktop main computer and connected to router. tablet is wireless. 1 have internet access on both. desktop can acess tablet. buttablet cannot access desktop. what am i missing?
xps firewall and turn off any others.
similar problem also using d-link 2.4ghz wireless router (model: di-724p+). able to access each pc's shsred folders when they are all in wired lan mode. disconnecting the network cable from notebook, still can share. when any one pc is rebooted, unable to share folders with each other. access to the internet is alright in any configuration. desktop pc (ethernet port) using win xp and zonealarm suite notebook pc (with wirless and ethernet port) using win xp home and trend micro internet security suite one question: the ssid name for the wireless network must it be the same as the workgroup name? currently, i am using the same name for both. appreciate your input. thanks you
the ssid name for the wireless network must it be the same as the workgroup name? no. but what many discover is the wep/wpa doesn't work across vendors. updated firmware in the router may help, and sometimes does not. workaround? none. what can you do? either change the router or use mac filtering. bob
