i am planning on building my own pc soon, and have a good grasp of everything i need, the only think i never see mentioned is the netowrk slot. do ineed to buy a network card to plug my calbe modem ethernet cable into or is there on built into the mother board?
most if not all mobos have the rj45 network jack built into the motherboard. just check the specs on the board to be sure.
i haven't seen a mobo in a while that doesn't have at least one ethernet port built into it. even $40 boards do, and many motherboards have two. shouldn't be a problem there.
thanks! so i guess i dont need to buy a ethernet card when i am buying stuff for my new pc? i can just plug my cable modem right into my motherboard and get online?
yep, it's that simple.
if your cable modem isn't a combination modem-router, i'd install a router with a firewall between the cable modem and your computers for security purposes.
