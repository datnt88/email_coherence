lately, i've had a problem with my display when scrolling pages (on and off-line) and when dragging windows around. it'll go black and my monitor seems to reset and displace text and images when it reappears. i use windows xp. i don't know if this is a hardware problem, but it really annoys me. has anyone seen this before?
lately? use xp's system restore to the day before the issue began to rule out the software angle. bob
my system restore won't display dates beore the month of november. my problem begamn in early october. i try to click the back arrows, but it won't o back.
you get to face the possibility that the os may be reinstalled. before that, have your xp cd handy and run... sfc /scannow if it still fails after a reboot, then research your video card make/model, go download and install the latest drivers, install, reboot and retest. best of luck, bob
