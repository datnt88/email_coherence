<s> hi all, i want to assemble a computer...but i have no direct experience.  </s>
<s> i want a step by step account to construct a celeron 1.7 ghz processor system.....right from the 'putting it together' phase to the 'frequency setting and other bios settings' phase.  </s>
<s> i have knowledge of computer hardware but i have never done it by myself.  </s>
<s> i am definately going to take some help, but it would be nice if some one knows useful sites with proper documentation and pictures.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> unmesh  </s>
<s> covers all if not most of the steps.  </s>
<s> but let me write about the risk factor.  </s>
<s> as the designer and builder of the new pc, you are buying in that any goof on your part or even a dead component supplied to you is your problem to find and deal with.  </s>
<s> some can't imagine why they have to buy a new motherboard if their homebuilt unit motherboard fails.  </s>
<s> but this is the risk you are accepting.  </s>
<s> in closing, be sure that money is not why you are doing this.  </s>
<s> new, complete over 2ghz p4 boxes are ready to use at 399 dollars.  </s>
<s> you may not be able to beat that price.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i googled for 'build a computer' and found these: there are many more help pages available at google.com.  </s>
<s> if you proceed, check and recheck your work.  </s>
<s> get a large power supply (450 watt or more).  </s>
<s> ken  </s>
<s> well it is more cost effective to buy a box new but there's a lot to be said for the fun and satisfaction of building it yourself.  </s>
<s> plus you get to post to this forum a lot more!! one thing you might want to start with is buying a bunch of $5 parts on ebay and building a 450 mhz machine just to practice building, and to use your old parts.  </s>

<s> 90% of your computer jobs can be done very well with a pii machine, and it's good to have a spare for e mail if you screw up your main box.  </s>
<s> when building a state of the art new machine, my advice: don't skimp on the case.  </s>
<s> this was my most expensive lesson.  </s>
<s> cooling the overall system is, for the most part, not mentioned by makers of individual components, and a big fan on the cpu may not be enough.  </s>
<s> the size of the case is a factor.  </s>
<s> just pay attention to that-- and, of course, don't zap the components with static electricity.  </s>
