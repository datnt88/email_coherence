forum, i recently purchased a canon hf11 32gb video camera. i am not willing to install an internal hard drive into my computer that is becoming dated. i figured a 2tb fantom gf2000eu ought to do. am i missing something here or is this the correct solution?
but i opted for 2 so they can sync and if one fails i have a chance to obtain another backup unit. many go for such and store files but forget backups. also, video editing on usb drives usually takes all the fun out of editing. see  bob
bob, do you have a recommendation? maybe 2 of these hard drives? and editing software? my old pinnacle is 8 years old and i'm sure there is a better editng software. the link you attached is a jpeg. thanks, matt
maybe 2 of those drives. that way you sync one to the other. i use syncback.  here's another jpeg about video editing on usb drives -&gt;  sony vegas is always a favorite in the forums. bob
