<s> i had problems with my computer and had to reload everything.  </s>
<s> if i go to the start at the lower left side click on it then go to turn off computer i used to be able to click on the standbuy icon, and computer would go into hibernate/ standby mode and since reloading everything it will not go into the standby mode.  </s>
<s> not a real rocket scientist when it comes to computers,if some one could explain how to get this working again it would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thank you, mspek.  </s>
<s> try ending any programs running, like in the taskbar, and then try going in standy.  </s>
<s> click start&gt;control panel&gt;performance and maintenance&gt; then power options, you will see what to do once you're there.  </s>
