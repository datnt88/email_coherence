i have a canon dvd camcorder dc210. i have a mac g5 os x 10.4.11 i want to download movies from the canon to the desktop but the camera does not have a usb port. what are my options?
this camera records directly onto dvd so your only option is to take the finished dvd and copy it onto your mac. without any conversion of the video, you will not be able to edit it using imovie. p
thanks for the info. what is the best camera to have for downloading to a computer. one w/ a usb type hard drive? i guess for now, i am stuck or i should say my wife is stuck w/ her camera. oh, well mike
all of the hard drive based camera's will download to the mac, as will most of the mini dv tape models. these typically use a firewire connection while the hard drive based ones use usb. sony make a good range, which work with imovie but there is one major brand that does not work with mac at all. i'll find the name and post it here later. you can edit the footage from the one you have but you first have to convert it to something that imovie can handle. take a look at this page on the apple site. it deals with importing video from a disk. click here p
