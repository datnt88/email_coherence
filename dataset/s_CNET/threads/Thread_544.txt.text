just bought a freeagent pro. seagate says it can back up data from a pc or a mac--but not both at the same time. &quot;you have to format it for one or the other. but there may be third-party software to allow you to use it for both.&quot; is there such a program? d.w.
and the difference in usage between the ntfs file system and the fat-32 file system. but don't hold your breath.
i don't know anything about ntfs or fat, so i won't even try it. oh well, i'm not fussed about it. got a good price on the seagate at costco, so backing up the pc is good enough for now. thanks! d.w.
