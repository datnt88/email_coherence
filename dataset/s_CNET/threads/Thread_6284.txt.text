that may be the problem....what operating system are u using?
windows xp sp2
i suspect, that it is a temp problem related to poor air circulation inside the case. so many things that have fans use fans that are temp controlled for local temp conditions, by the system being idle the fans run slower and possibly results in less air movement in remote areas. i had a system where the promise chip would cause such a problem. also had cases where the hard drive simply got to hot and stopped things. i put a small fan in that moved air over the hard drive area and that stopped the drive from getting too hot. the ribbon cables for all the stuff you have are huge restrictions for moving air to hit all cubby holes iside the case. due to the simple fact that hot air rises, i now only use cases with a top exhaust fan and a side intake fan [in addition to the rear exhaust and power supply fans].
