<s> i am looking to log on to the internet if i am traveling and not at a wi-fi hotspot.  </s>
<s> i guess i am confused on the difference between wi-fi and wireless internet provided by a phone company like alltel or verizon.  </s>
<s> if i buy a laptop that says it has 802.11g, is that just good for wi-fi at a starbucks or some other &quot;hotspot&quot;, or will 802.11g also work for providing wireless internet access with a phone provider like alltel, verizon, etc? maybe i should also ask if 802.11g is a card built into a laptop, and if you must have another type of card for wireless internet service?  </s>
<s> 802.11g is now a common feature built in to laptops.  </s>
<s> it allows you to connect to hotspots or your home network.  </s>
<s> it will not connect to your phone provider's wireless internet access.  </s>
<s> you must purchase a different card for that.  </s>
<s> 802.11 cards are for hot spots and wifi if you want to use the internet anywhere and everywhere, get a nice cell phone(like my blackberry) and tether with it, or a mobile broadband card and stick it in your laptop.  </s>
