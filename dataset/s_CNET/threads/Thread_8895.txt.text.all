<s> my toshiba l505-s5990 will only allow connections to unsecured networks.  </s>
<s> finally had to reset my router at home through my desktop as unsecured so i can get a wireless connection on my laptop but of course do not want to keep my home network unsecured.  </s>
<s> help.  </s>
<s> notes one of the real odd ball causes.  </s>
<s> sorry but tell a bit more.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> at one point, a microsoft driver was updated and toshiba support said that was the cause (6 months ago).  </s>
<s> they had me reset to factory (f11 i think) and this seemed to work.  </s>
<s> two weeks ago, lost access.  </s>
<s> after setting back to previous time (two weeks earlier when repair shop set to factory for virus removal), no microsoft driver, just realtek but still was having problems.  </s>
<s> reset driver, reloaded disc for linksys on laptop, etc but no luck.  </s>
<s> took laptop out of house to test remote places to determine if router or not and this worked.  </s>
<s> then set up router through my desktop, kept unsecured and laptop connects without issue (so far).  </s>
<s> i have not tried to add security through desktop but that was goint to be my next step but when i tried to connect to secure connection with correct password at remote location, computer would not connect.  </s>
<s> hope this is enough info.  </s>
<s> thanks for trying.  </s>
<s> try the toshiba support site and install the motherboard chipset drivers then the wifi driver again.  </s>
<s> sorry to read about a virus.  </s>
<s> this usually means yet another reload.  </s>
