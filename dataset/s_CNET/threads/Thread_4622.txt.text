i installed a new wireless router. my computer detected signal from my neighbors house as well as from my own router. what prevents my neighbor from accessing files on my computer? the firewall? are there any precautions i should take for added security? also, the router is less than 50 feet away from the computer, yet the signal strength is poor. how can i increase the signal strength? any help is appreciated.
two things. in this order!! 1. update all firmware in all devices. for me, this has paid off well. 2. enable mac address filtering. only what's in the list can now connect. bob
thanks for the info, but what is &quot;firmware&quot; and &quot;mac filtering&quot; and how do i update these?
both these terms and items are either in the router's manual or the maker's web site. since i don't see the make/model in your last reply, i leave it to you to look at the maker's web site for the firmware update and how to enable mac filtering. example at  bob
you need to make sure that you secure your wireless network. you will need to make sure you use a wep key. without using the key your leaving your wireless connection open for anyone to join.
