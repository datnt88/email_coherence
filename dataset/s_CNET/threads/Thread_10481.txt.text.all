<s> hi all i need help i have an hp media center pc its the one with all the connections in the front one group of connections is for analog connections for a vcr, dvd, or analog camcorder.  </s>
<s> on hps site it says that if you want to convert old home movies or tape recordings to a digital format is what the front analog connections are for.  </s>
<s> when i connect my analog camcorder to it nothing happens i figure i need some type of software to recognize the front port am i wrong?  </s>
<s> and if i do need some kind of software what do i need all the software i have looked at says it only reads from firewire or usb but not analog i know that i can buy a separate piece of hardware but that defeats the reason of why i bought the hp media center in the first place i wanted the built in analog ports.  </s>
<s> i called hp but they dont know what to do (strange) can someone plz help me  </s>
<s> so let's start with remember this system may let you record content but will not create a dvd from such.  </s>
<s> for that you have to buy something that will handle the usual dvr-ms files that media center creates. the trick is to get the camcorder showing on the tv settings.  </s>
<s> and once there you can record it to the usual dvr-ms files.  </s>
<s> for me this is far too much work so i move to other software fast.  </s>

<s> ok get this i called hp back and asked about the analog connections in the front of the media center and how to get it working.  </s>
<s> i gave them all the serial numbers and model first the lady try to tell me that the connections arent real.  </s>
<s> i told her im starring right at it i finally got her to look on there own website and see that the connections are real.  </s>
<s> then she try to tell me that i need a device that would change my analog from analog to digital then back to analog again then send it to the analog connection on the media center. then i showed her on there website where it say you can capture video directly from analog devices such as vcr, or analog camcorder then she wanted to charge me $65.00 to talk to someone who would be able to tell me how the ports (that she said werent real) work.  </s>
<s> this is proper since there is no detection that such were connected.  </s>
<s> it's an old electronics issue and not a bug or omission by anyone.  </s>
<s> if the unit claims you can convert your media and you can't find out how then why not ask for every dime back?  </s>
