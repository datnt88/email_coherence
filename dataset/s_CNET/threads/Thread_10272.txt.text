i have an abit aa8xe mainboard which will supports up to 4gig of single/dual channel dimm modules, delivering bandwidth of 8.5gb/sec. it originally used ddr2 400 but i have some newer ddr2 800(pc6400). will there be any compatibility issues?
compatibility depends on the actual dimms. as long as they have spd timings for ddr2-533 and can function with 1.8v, you should be ok. ddr2-400 is a rare beast nowadays.
thanks for your input, i got it working good with both speeds of ram! now if i can get the second memory bank slots to accept my other 1gb sticks..........
