i just installed a 2.4gig wireless camera that is hooked up to my desktop and the problem is that there is a small amount of interference with that signal and my wireless router. can the frequency on the dlink be changed?
try 1, 5 and 11.
i have read the manual and searched online for how to change the channel, but have not found how yet. any help? thanks
i think i may have found it
