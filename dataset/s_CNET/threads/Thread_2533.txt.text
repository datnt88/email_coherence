i have fitted a new 200gig maxtor ide hard drive, it shows in bios and in hardware list. i cant find the drive in 'my computer' and it is not listed or assigned a designated drive letter?. it is set to and recognised as a slave drive. can anyone help please. i am running windows xp pro.
is it pata or sata? makes a difference. it sounds like it needs to be formatted. chuck
run the new hareware scan and then try to install the drivers for it. should then show in my computer
right click on my computer. click manage. click disk management under storage. right click on the drive and initialize. then format.
