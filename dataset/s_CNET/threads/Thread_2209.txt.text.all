<s> hello, what is the fastest way for calculating the power consumption of: pc (with nic) 17in lcd monitor router hub printer (laser as well as deskjet) scanner webcam in brief, i am building a network of 8 to 12 pc for a internet club use and i wish to calculate my monthly power consumption.  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> far from scientific, but my method is 100 watts per big device.  </s>
<s> 10 watts for little things (webcam, scanner.) the laset is all over the map from 1000 watts when printing to some under 10 idle, so the 100 watt number evens out the numbers.  </s>
<s> you can also go to radio shack and for under 20 bucks get a ac wattmeter if you want to be accurate, but you may be surprised how close i am. bob  </s>
<s> hello bob, thanx for your humorous but nonetheless serious reply.  </s>
<s> i found a site that helps which i share with you (and all who migh come across this issue): now, i have another question: bearing in mind that i am nill in physics, let's say my pc power consumption is 300 watts and it runs for 12 hours daily; what formula do i use to get the 12hrs power consumption?  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> at 300 watts, that's 12 hours or ... 3.6 kilowatt hours.  </s>
<s> it's simple watts times hours.  </s>
