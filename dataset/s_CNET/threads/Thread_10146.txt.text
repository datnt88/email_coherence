hi, i'm about to start my undergrad this fall and hopefully major in industrial engineering. every living fibre in me is telling me to get the new macbook but i can't help but wonder if a pc would be much more suitable for my studies. i'll be using the laptop mainly for music, movies and work. so, mac or pc?
what programs you will absolutely have to use for your course. then check to see if there is a mac equivalent. if there is, go get a mac. if there isn't, go get a mac, load boot camp, load windows and only use it for that one, absolutely have to use, windows program. the rest of the time, enjoy os x would that be the macbook or the macbook pro? p
yup, took your advice and asked my school to which they replied by sending me this link,  and by telling me that the engineering department runs windows and unix machines. sorry but i'm a (soon to be) first time mac user, shouldn't a mac be able to work since its based on unix? anyways, as mrmacfixit asked, i think it's going to be the 2ghz macbook and i'll throw in my own 2gb of ram.
that the productivity software is ms office. available as office 2004 for mac, student & teacher edition ($125) has everything except ms access. check out the on line software catalog, they sell mac stuff! also note that their &quot;recommended&quot; computer purchase is a windows box. the fact that the engineering department runs unix machines does not mean that require students to have a computer that will run unix. i am not aware of a unix/windows dual boot machine, bob will comment if there is, but you have an advantage as your mac has a form of unix already, if you actually need a unix machine. your lovely new 2ghz macbook will do admirably and, with boot camp, will even run windows. good luck p
