<s> does anybody know of a value that i can put into the mouse registry to make it more precise?  </s>
<s> the preciseness of a mouse comes from the hardware's dpi measurement.  </s>
<s> wikipedia: dots per inch i might be wrong... but that's what i &quot;know&quot;  </s>
<s> on this machine.  </s>
<s> if i go to control panel&gt;mouse.  </s>
<s> i can adjust the sensitivity of the mouse/pointer.  </s>
<s> would that actually make it smoother?  </s>
<s> yea it would be smoother but it would be a pain if it's so low that it takes like 3 seconds to get on opposite corners of the screen :p i think my best bet is to actually get a high quality mouse.  </s>
