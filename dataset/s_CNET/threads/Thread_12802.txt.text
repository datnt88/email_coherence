my old hp desk top hard drive crashed long ago (2008?). i had a tech come to the house to repair and replaced the hard drive. per my request , he had also opened up the hdd so i could see what the actual disk looked like inside. i removed the disk from its casing and stored it away (avoiding any static damage). since i no longer have its original casing and components , is it still possible to have any info/data recovered? ive heard recently that it is not possible. please let me know,,no point in still holding onto it if that is the case..thanks
once you've opened the hard drive, it can't be read by ordinary means, but there are companies that will recover the data for a price. i've never had need for that because i always back my data up, but i've read that these services cost in the $1000 to $2000 range. for most folks it's not worth it. since it's been 5 years for you, i'd be surprised if it were worth it to you. but if it is, go for it!
you've removed any possible chance that an user could recover any data, excluding some weird geek type. the only practical option is to have some &quot;data recovery service&quot; where you send away the discs to try to do this. of course those services costs tend to be expensive, so you decide if the data is worth it. tada -----willy
i just may throw it out in the trash after-all. thats too bad..:(
