<s> i have an emachine t3882 and it can be slow at times.  </s>
<s> it has a celeron d 2.8ghz processor with socket 478.  </s>
<s> i upgraded the ram to just one ram stick of 1 gb. it boots up fast and everything but loading after login takes a long time.  </s>
<s> for example, to launch ie7 it can take up to 30secs sometimes maybe even more time.  </s>
<s> i have a gift card to amazon which i would like to use for upgrade this pc. but i do not know if it is worth spending money on it.  </s>
<s> what do you guys suggest?  </s>
<s> if it is worth while to upgrade it, what better processor and new cpu fan would you recommend?  </s>
<s> i currently have the stock cpu fan which can get pretty loud.  </s>
<s> i was also thinking of adding another 1gb stick of ram thanks  </s>
<s> this has all the specs on the stock machine just in case  </s>
<s> well, your processor basically is awful.  </s>
<s> never buy a celeron they are junk.  </s>
<s> i have never seen a computer with a celeron run well.  </s>
<s> the celerons are rejects of the core 2 duos.  </s>
<s> you may as well just get a new computer because it will be a pain to upgrade just the processor there are basically no processors that go in that socket any more its to old.  </s>
<s> sorry, i got it wrong, you have a single core but they are still rejects.  </s>
<s> yes you can upgrade that machine.  </s>
<s> and for much cheaper then buying a new computer.  </s>
<s> it won't run as fast as a new comp.  </s>
<s> (obviously), but will still run faster then what you have.  </s>
<s> first buy one more 1gb stick of ram (that pc can have a max of 2gb and you might as well max it out).  </s>
<s> secondly, upgrade your processor to a pentium 4 (you can probably find one online for $40 bucks).  </s>
<s> that should do it.  </s>
<s> if you have any questions about your processor compatibility here's check this link out -- (but all pentium 4s look to be compatible with a celeron d chipset.  </s>
