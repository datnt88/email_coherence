i want to sell my computer. i need to wipe the hd clean of data. i deleted programs and uninstalled programs from control panel. i am going to empty recycle bin. what else do i need to do?
what you wrote does not remove such information very well.
i want to know what more i need to do. i need steps to wipe my hard drive clean. i found the program, eraser that deletes the internet information. what more do i need. if you don't know, don't answer.
use the factory restoral cds that came with the pc. restore it to factory day one out of the box. if the pc came with a restoral partition on the hard drive, use it the same way. since you still neglected to give make and model, these are the only two for restoral. or, you can google dban which will completely wipe the hard drive.
