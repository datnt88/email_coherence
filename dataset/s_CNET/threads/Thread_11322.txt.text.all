<s> i am trying to help out a friend with xp. he has 2 external hard drives on is a 500 gb western digital the other is a 1.5 gb solo external hard drive fireproof and waterproof...yeh a little over kill!  </s>
<s> his computer is about 8 year old dell...it even has a floppy drive.  </s>
<s> he saves everything!  </s>
<s> his hard drive has almost no free space.  </s>
<s> what i would love to do is set up his computer to save all his files directly to the 500 gb hard drive.  </s>
<s> not on his computers hard drive!  </s>
<s> i was going to partition the 1.5 gb hard drive so there is a complete back up of his computer hard drive on the first partiion.  </s>
<s> also, i would love to sync his 1.5 gb second partition to his 500 gb hard drive (which is actually saving all his files?  </s>
<s> do you have any suggestions?  </s>
<s> i have figured out how to assign dirve letters.  </s>
<s> i know how to partition.  </s>
<s> i don't know how to sync one hard drive to the other or automatically save files directly to the 500gb.  </s>
<s> note: i have backed up his hard drive right now to the 500gb.  </s>
<s> using windows back up.  </s>
<s> he deleted the wd software of the 500gb!  </s>
<s> thanks for your time...ynotbme &lt;div class=&quot;inter-pagination collapsable&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postactions collapsable clearfix clearboth&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  </s>
<s> isn't an external drive just another drive.  </s>
<s> why can't you do thing with it just like an internal one (except maybe putting an os there).  </s>
<s> you can move the my documents folder to the other drive.  </s>
<s> there is also the ms &quot;tweakui&quot; powertool that can help.  </s>
<s> it has an option regarding special folders of which my documents is one of these.  </s>
<s> it will help redirect the default locations where such files tend to land.  </s>
<s> personally i prefer using the &quot;save as&quot; option and don't find it that inconvenient.  </s>
<s> but, if that's what your friend wants, it can be done.  </s>
