<s> i use to build computers all the time, maybe 20-25 total, but that was way back in the 2-core days.  </s>
<s> i just simply burned out & didn't have fun doing it any longer.  </s>
<s> but i still do my own family computers, since i'm a bit picky.  </s>
<s> i guess i was pretty good at picking the pieces, since this ancient athlon64x2-4800+ / nvidia9800gt rig is only now feeling serious effects of the &quot;i-can't-do-that&quot; disease.  </s>
<s> so it's time for new. the results of several recent 3a.m.  </s>
<s> bedtimes have allowed me to figure out the best parts for my price-range ... graphics, memory, case, drives, etc. the mobo won't be a problem, since that's always been my favorite piece to research.  </s>
<s> however, because of how long i've been out of the loop, i'm way behind on new cpu-tech.  </s>
<s> that's where i need your help, although i have narrowed the possibilities down to a minimum.  </s>
<s> there's just a couple (that means 3 or 5) items which i'm still clueless about.  </s>
<s> you saw above i haven't picked a mobo yet, for the obvious reason i haven't picked a cpu yet.  </s>
<s> but i'm going with 1 of 6 for sure (or 1 of 9, i'll elaborate at the end).  </s>
<s> although i've used 90% amd's, i'm not completely intel-stupid.  </s>
<s> i'm not a fan-boy either way & hope this thread doesn't devolve into that.  </s>
<s> so the basics are, i'm looking at amd fx-8350, 8320, or 8120.  </s>
<s> i shouldn't even include the last one, since it ranks quite a bit lower than the first 2 on about every benchmark/comparison i've been able to find, at only $25'ish cheaper.  </s>
<s> these are all 8-core.  </s>
<s> now, for intel, i've picked i5-2450p, 3470, or 2500k.  </s>
<s> i've read remarkable stories about the last one, even though several benchmarks place it a bit lower than the 1st two.  </s>
<s> however, i'm a good oc'er & seems like that &quot;k&quot; signifies a chip which works well with that art, so it could probably be convinced to operate at near the performance of the 1st two.  </s>
<s> and it also already has a higher clock speed than either, but significantly lower than the 1st two amds.  </s>
<s> i'm plenty computer-savvy to know that doesn't mean a whole lot in modern chips, but i'll be the first to admit that it's my major cpu-weakness .... i luv seeing those monstrous clocks, like the 4.0ghz of the biggest amd above.  </s>
<s> i do know that typically intel usually beats amd same-4-same, and quite often even a couple notches higher of an amd.  </s>
<s> but here's my main stickler.  </s>
<s> best that i can tell, all i5's are 4-core.  </s>
<s> all amd's above are 8-core.  </s>
<s> (let's not get into hyperthreading discussion in depth, although it may play a part, if i5's actually have it) so ... even though intel chips quite often outperform amd chips, will those 8-core amd chips have a noticable advantage above those 4-core intels?  </s>
<s> if not, will those extra 4 cores allow the amd chips to perform as well as the intels?  </s>
<s> i bring that up because all of the amd's, with only 1 sole exception, are up to 60 bucks cheaper.  </s>
<s> i'm not building a bargain-basement system here, but i'm also a disabled vet with fixed income.  </s>
<s> $25 doesn't matter, $60 might.  </s>
<s> so will i get better performance from those faster, bigger, & cheaper amds?  </s>
<s> or will the somewhat more expensive, smaller, & slower intels still outdo them?  </s>
<s> that's the main question & the only one i need a definite answer to.  </s>
<s> however, as hinted at above, there are 3 more cpus i'm eyeing as curiosities. the a10-5800k, a10-5700, & a8-5600k apus, with integrated graphics.  </s>
<s> now right off the bat i know these don't ompute as well as any of the 6 above, but they aren't dramatically too far back.  </s>
<s> my new build will have a great graphics card in it, so i'm not saying i'll rely on the onboard video.  </s>
<s> but the plan is to buy sli/crossfire capable stuff, but only 1 card for now.  </s>
<s> i'm not even sure i'll like a dual graphic set-up, but doing it this way allows me to add that second card later, if i so choose.  </s>
<s> but will these chips with onboard radeon graphics work together with a dedicated radeon card, much like a crossfire setup?  </s>
<s> he biggest & neatest advantage i see by going this apu-route is that i would still have working video if i blew my card up.  </s>
<s> (remember i said that i oc'd .... well, sometimes i od too & burn something up ) so does either of these reasons give me a legitimate reason to go with the less powerful apus, which will actually do all the computing i want to do anyway?  </s>
<s> last thing, an &quot;addie&quot; since we got to talking about onboard graphic stuff.  </s>
<s> i noticed that some new mobos have some decent onboard graphics now.  </s>
<s> will this graphics do an sli/crossfire-type deal with a dedicated video card?  </s>
<s> does it have to be the same brand?  </s>
<s> in other words, if the mobo graphics are radeon, will it work with nvidia, or just radeon?  </s>
<s> this option would allow me to do what i should do anyway & go with one of the faster pure-cpus.  </s>
<s> but then i'd still have that extra graphics when i melt my new dedicated video card.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for all help.  </s>
<s> add this.  </s>
<s> maybe it'll help with the cpu choice between intel 4-cores & amd 8-cores.  </s>
<s> 3 things i basically do: 1. i game.  </s>
<s> never on-line.  </s>
<s> my games are almost entirely simulators.  </s>
<s> simcity4, upcoming simcity limited, trainz 2011, cities-xl, tropico-4, civ-5, junk like that.  </s>
<s> i'm not running & shooting, but sometimes (often) build up humongous maps & metros.  </s>
<s> 2. i'm an author.  </s>
<s> my books are almost always 1 of 2 genres.  </s>
<s> #1 is novels built around events which could, or have, happened.  </s>
<s> these require lots of research, so sometimes i may have 50 tabs open on 2 different browsers + my text editor open somewhere else.  </s>
<s> i figure this type usage is more bandwidth/memory intensive, but it does use processor power also.  </s>
<s> #2 type is big eye-candy books, the expensive type with large pretty pictures & little writing which you leave open on the end-table to impress your friends.  </s>
<s> here i may have much fewer tabs open, but they will each contain large hi-res images.  </s>
<s> i may also have 1 or 2 image editors going (photoshop, ultimate-paint, format changers, etc.) so i figure this type is more graphic intensive, less bandwidth, about the same memory.  </s>
<s> 3. i'm a very active & somewhat advanced astrophotographer. the images i take through the scopes via ccd are b&w exposed through 4 color filters.  </s>
<s> the result is a set of &quot;fits&quot; files, usually around 1500x1200, & often up to 300mb each, depending upon how long the exposure was.  </s>
<s> all 4 of these will be open at one time in photoshop, while i align, crop, adjust, etc. the final, usually 500mb'ish, then goes through a converter to make it into hi-res tiffs or lower-res pngs.  </s>
<s> very high memory usage, cpu, gpu, everything.  </s>
<s> maybe that info will help a little on which cpu-type is better.  </s>
<s> being a little intel biases and with bucks in mind. the i5-2500/3570 seems to be the sweet spot/bang for the buck.  </s>
<s> if you want to overclock add a &quot;k&quot; to the model.  </s>
<s> yes it only has 4 cores and yes you may have some app/s that will be faster with 8 cores.  </s>
<s> ram...........the fastest the machine will support.  </s>
<s> amount......enough to keep the swap file quiet.  </s>
<s> i don't think your going to go very far wrong with that combo.  </s>
<s> i'm in the process of my first custom build and was about to purchase an i5 2nd gen 2400.  </s>
<s> what is the difference between the two.  </s>
<s> and do i need a gen 3 intel processor to take advantage of sli pcie 3.0?  </s>
<s> i have a cousin who is an accountant and i built her a system around the intel&#174; core&#8482; i5-2400 and the asus p8z68-m pro board.  </s>
<s> she loves it and very happy with it.  </s>
<s> for gamer the intel core i5-2500k is a great value but if you aren't going to overclock then that really isn't much of a reason to spend the extra money.  </s>
<s> 2400@3.1......turbo 3.4 2500@3.3......turbo 3.7 and do i need a gen 3 intel processor to take advantage of sli pcie 3.0?  </s>
<s> looks like yes.  </s>
