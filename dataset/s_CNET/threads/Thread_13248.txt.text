i have a hard drive that i know is perfectly ok but, it will not be recogniosed by the bios. i know there is a cure for this, i'm not bothered about losing data. i just want to access it to re-format it and make it usefull!
how is it jumpered? reseat the ide, and/or try a new 80 wire cable. try the secondary channel.
you have really supplied no info that will help. how old is the computer, what brand, model, motherboard? how big is the hard drive. how large a hard drive worked before? many older systems are unable to see drives that are over 8gb or 32gb or somewhere larger or smaller, depends on the age of the system. give us facts!!!
