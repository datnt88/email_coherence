<s> i feel so embarassed.  </s>
<s> i have searched high and low for a straight answer but i can't seem to work out how to create a home wireless network in my house.  </s>
<s> i don't know whether it's so easy it's not published anywhere or whether i'm missing something or what but i can't find what i think i'm looking for and it's so common i feel embarassed.  </s>
<s> so i turn to you guys.  </s>
<s> apologies if you think i'm an idiot but please help me out, i am for real.  </s>
<s> i have a pc running windows xp upstairs with a wireless adapter.  </s>
<s> if a machine is to act as like a server then this is the one i'd want it to be.  </s>
<s> downstairs i have a netgear wireless router which is plugged into my dsl line, acting as the modem my crappy isp gave me for free.  </s>
<s> with an ethernet cable i have my xbox plugged in to this. then i also roam the house with a laptop running windows vista.  </s>
<s> oh and my flat mate also has a laptop running windows xp. all i want to do is set up a home network, wireless of course, that enables me to see all devices (pc, laptop, and xbox) on the network, from each machine.  </s>
<s> i want to be able to transfer files between machines over the network and be able to communicate with my xbox from my pc or laptop.  </s>
<s> i would also like my flat mate to be able to tap into the network when he likes so we can transfer files between our computers.  </s>
<s> i plan on hooking up a printer to the router at a later stage for shared printing too.  </s>
<s> that's it.  </s>
<s> that's all i want to do. is that so hard?  </s>
<s> so what i'm after is a step-by-step guide on configuring this.  </s>
<s> if someone could point me in the right direction i would be eternally grateful.  </s>
<s> thanks for your time  </s>
<s> the step by step is still only a guide and will never match exactly what you see on the screen.  </s>
<s> i hope this explains that issue well enough for you.  </s>
<s> as to your issue today, you omitted the part names, models, makes, how it's connected so there is little more i can offer except to note that the usual cause of not seeing file and printer shares are firewall settings.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks. could you point me in the direction of them guides then please?  </s>
<s> if you look to the top of this forum networking & wireless we have a forum sticky about suggested settings.  </s>
<s> your router maker's web site will have the manuals and more guides.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i use a program called network magic that automates many of the functions you are attempting to do.  </s>
<s> there is a free version to download and try.  </s>
