i would like to set up my system so that my friends and family can access a folder on my system through the internet to download pictures and such. i have a home network set up with a cable modem and router. can i set up something that is password protected so i am not exposing my system to every hacker in the universe? my linksys router has the capability to set up a dmz outside the firewall, but that seems risky to me. it seems as though there must be a simple way to accomplish all this, but i haven't found it yet!
alternative:
it is worth the hassle to be this secure. bob
thanks, michael. i have used ophoto, but i'm looking for something that will allow other file types as well as pictures.
thanks, bob. i will look into that!
check out sharedirect from laplink. it has 256-bit encryption, built in antivirus software, and lets you share files of any type - not just pictures. another bonus for you is that it can work through firewalls and routers without any special configuration.
