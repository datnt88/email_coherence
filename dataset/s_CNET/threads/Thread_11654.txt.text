hi, first off sorry if is this wrong place was a bit confused where this thread belongs.. i just need to crimp a rj11 connector to a heavy duty cat5 cable that can be ran outside and withstand weather. or if anyone can direct me to a vendor which sells heavy duty rj11 cables. thanks for the help.
i exposed some standard interior phone cord to 5 years of new england weather and it's not cracked yet. are you sure you need to do this? why not just toss it into some pvc pipe if you have animal problems? bob
electronics supply store should carry insulated twisted pair cable however many pairs you want. tell them you want to bury the cable. i've done many building-to-building cable jobs using this. i also have used what bob's suggested with no problems. try cyberguys.com. and life goes on... jack
