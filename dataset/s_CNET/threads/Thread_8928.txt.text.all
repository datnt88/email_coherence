<s> you can connect an internal drive to a laptop, or almost any other computer, by way of a external hard drive mount, which is basically a case that encloses an internal drive and connects to the computer via usb, and some have firewire as well.  </s>
<s> google: 3.5'' external hard drive enclosure two main sizes of hd: 3.5'' = desktop hd 2.5'' = notebook hd external enclosrues are made for both sizes.  </s>
<s> there are models available that will enclose an ide (pata) or sata hd. your local computer and electronics stores carry them.  </s>
<s> cheapest prices are usually found online.  </s>
<s> adapters without a case are available as a nice temporary solution.  </s>
<s> example: note: connecting an external hd to a windows xp machine via usb 2.0 has a better track record than firewire.  </s>
<s> there are also some models that connect to an external sata port.  </s>
