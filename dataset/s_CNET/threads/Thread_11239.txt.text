i applied some thermal paste from radioshack on my cpu a week ago but then today i was switching the motherboard and i wanted to know cant i just take the heat sink off and just put it back on the new motherboard without reapplying it? i lost my thermal paste and i need to put my cpu in the new motherboard and i wanted to just move it without cleaning and reapplying. im not switching cpus, im just moving it.
there will be gaps. spring for a new tube.
if the paste is sufficiently present, sure you can reuse it. that's the true paste, not a heat pad which normally is shipped with new cpus. to play it safe, get another tube of paste, which would you rather do, replace paste or burnt-out cpu? tada -----willy
read #3 under ''application instructions.''
i used a paste i bought from radioshack then i put it away then now i got my mobo from what i just returned because it wasnt working and i cant find the paste i put away. its not a thermal pad its a grease from radioshack. its only been on there for about a week.
i have done this on multiple occasions....i know its not ideal. if it is as you say 1 week old you should be fine. i have never had a problem with it.
it was behind my comp desk and i used it on my cpu. thanks for the help anyway.
