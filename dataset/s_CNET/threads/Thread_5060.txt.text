i'm shopping for a new soundcard and need some advice on which one best suits my needs. the most important factor for a new card is audio quality for mp3 and games. i have 4.1 creative speakers so 7.1 capabilities aren't really necessary. i was thinking about the audigy 2 gamer or audigy 2 zs.
i'm a poor college kid so i'm planning on getting the audigy 2 gamer
yea, same here. going to be a poor college student anyway, last year in high school. looking to build a new system for college that'll last awhile. the gamer card is pretty expensive though. hopefully it'll come down by late may.
