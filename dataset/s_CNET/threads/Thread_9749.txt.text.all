<s> sometimes its vertical lines and sometimes its horizontal lines.  </s>
<s> i have updated wintv pvr-250 software and drivers all the way through too wintv 6 and have the same problem.  </s>

<s> i don't understand your answer.  </s>
<s> i am not complain about, as you say, &quot;new user of analog capture might and will complain about issues with video capture that just years ago folk accepted as normal.&quot; the problem i am having is so so bad, you can not see a picture.  </s>
<s> as for my post, are you suggesting i have post this question in the wrong forum?  </s>
<s> analog capture is full of bad things waiting for us to discuss.  </s>
<s> i can't tell from your first post how bad it was.  </s>
<s> maybe you can put in the full details and a youtube of the results?  </s>
<s> some folk are easily upset at discussion forums so if that's you, we might not get along.  </s>
<s> i have analog capture experience to before the amiga days, even on the ibm 8088 days so i'm ready when you tell more.  </s>
<s> in the meantime if you want to know what i use for the capture step it's a dvd recorder.  </s>
<s> that's my secret.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> well bob, i think i will visit a forum where the people are a bit more constructive.  </s>
<s> seen people like you before, they enjoy wasting others time.  </s>
<s> if you decide you can share the details about the source and more, i have this thread tracked.  </s>
