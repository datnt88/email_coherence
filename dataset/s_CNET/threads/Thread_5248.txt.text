i have an hp pavilion a6244n desktop. i need a replacement power supply for bestec atx-250-12z rev d6r. is there a compatible replacement available? thanks!!!
reading and looking at  tells me that this is a common atx power supply. that is, there are some thousand models that can replace this. here's one for the herd.  bob
you want to look at the physical size and specs for bestec model#. once you have that in hand, you compare to any similar or direct replacement psu. so be 100% sure the model# is what is stated on the decal/sticker located on the psu. then do your search. if as robert states is correct, you maybe lucky and have a common atx-12v type sized psu, which many are generic to your needs. btw, having more wattage and/or connections won't hurt.  tada -----willy
it's single rail.  vapcmd
thanks for that. after all the psu's i've replaced over the years, one of the best pieces of advice i found was to get a single rail when possible. bob
granddaughter's pc fails. it's got an inexpensive psu in it now and this one at $45 net will be worthwhile to have as a spare or a substitute if i decide to upgrade the system. vapcmd
