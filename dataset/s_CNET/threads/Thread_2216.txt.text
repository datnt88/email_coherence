didn't have a clue about xp black.. wouldn't know a pirate if it bite me on the back side. thank you for letting me know about that. will have a serious discussion with the person who sent it to me.. that's the last thing i needed on my computer! really angry about it. i honestly thought it was just another version. thanks again for the heads up. they will be dealt with and swiftly. please delete my previous post if possible. now i'm truly embarassed. it's not on my computer anymore though. xp media center is what's running on my pc now. thank you again.
the issue is all about drivers why it locks up. having &quot;xp black&quot; (see google) is not supportable by microsoft and forums like cnet for very simple reasons. moving on. this machine should have restore cds and maybe a second set of cds just for drivers. that's what i use. bob
just moments ago went to dell.com and bought a brand new dell studio xps 435mt built to my specifications with 12gig of ram etc etc. cost me $1900 by the time i got through adding goodies. my christmas present to myself. ships on december 15th. this compaq is swiftly on it's way out the door. won't trust anyone sending me a disc from now on! said disc just went through shredder. problem solved.
