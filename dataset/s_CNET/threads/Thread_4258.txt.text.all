<s> i recently built my own computer, everything has seemed to work fine, except on random occasions (sometimes it occurs a few minutes after turning on my computer, sometimes i can use it for a long time with nothing happening) i get a blue screen of death with &quot;driver corrupted mmpool&quot; and the techical data is ***stop:0x000000d0(0xb9bfd704) what should i do?  </s>
<s> sorry, i forgot to include that i have an amd x2 4400+, an epox nforce 4 motherboard, 1gb of patriot ddr400 memory, a 320gb sata ii harddrive, my old 200gb ata drive attached as a secondary drive, and im using windows xp pro.  </s>
