i have a doubt. what is the difference between pc2-4200 ram and pc-4200 ram...as far as i know both have 533 mhz memory speed and 4.2 gb bandwidth...will they work in the same slots? (ddr2 ofcourse)
sorry but to save me looking it up can you provide links to said products? bob
is ddr2. ddr2 has higher latency, however if the system supports that memory [ignoring overclocking] you have no choice. many people put pc-4200 into mobos thare support pc 3200 but then overclock the emeory bus.
