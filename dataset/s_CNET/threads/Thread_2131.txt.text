i thinking of buying a external hd and i was wondering if i should wait until usb 3.0 comes out in 2010, or the next version of firewire (s3200). i was looking for a (or at least) 1 tb external hd with usb 2.0, firewire 400 and 800. the seagate freeagent mac seems perfect, and is priced over $200. considering both my computers have firewire 800 capabilities... but with the next gen hardware coming out, what would you do? do you think usb 3 hds will be available instantly after the release and would hd pricing go up?
let me summarize it. for hard disks: windows? connect with usb. apple? use firewire. linux? either works fine. yes some found it to work with their system but given the number of times i've seen it fail i offer the short version. bob
obviously you are not in a hurry or you wouldn't be asking the question. the harddrives will be the same; only the electronic will be changed. if you wanted to be the first with the latest..there will be more to pay (new mobo or new controller), hehe.
