10502	4	260324	2562928	2562697	ramarc	8/14/07 4:17 pm	1.18710822e12	that's ridiculous	creative cards have better in game sound and faster acceleration resulting in faster framerates than any other brand of sound card. benchmarks on the audigy 2 and later series have proven this. turtle beach is an ok card but won't produce the same framerates. m-audio's revolution has better sound quality than an audigy 2 for music/dvd, but can't match the audigy's game performance. and an $80 x-fi will match the m-audio's sound.   and eax 3+ is much better at positioning than direct sound. the difference is so dramatic that anyone can tell the difference.

10502	6	260324	2563343	2562928	ozos	8/15/07 10:40 am	1.1871744e12	ok, well	i see that marketing has done its job for you, audio processors do not and will not increase game performance, and i don't give a hoot what anand or creative's marketing literature tells us, you may see a marked performance increase of something like 4 fps, which in real world means nothing to anyone the reason one purchases a sound card is to increase audio quality, not for gaming, and creative dearly lacks audio quality the audigy 2 is, compared to the revolution, riviera, or x-plosion, a joke of a card, and while eax 3+ may be &quot;oh so cool&quot;, name more than 10 games that can use it, that are presently on the market, have shipped any signifigant number of units, etc fear doesn't doom 3 doesn't half-life 2 doesn't oblivion doesn't farcry doesn't starcraft doesn't warcraft iii doesn't world of warcraft doesn't total annihilation doesn't everquest doesn't counter-strike/counter-strike: source don't unreal 2003/2004 don't thats more or less the biggest games of the last 5 to 10 years right there, the boards i reccomended all feature better quality, better prices, and for the naysayers, at minimum eax 2 capability, yes, paying $200 for a creative board just to get creative's highly proprietary and buggy eax platform for 3d gaming may be neat, but when we're talking drivers that will break at the drop of a hat, barely official vista compatability, horrible vista audio support, questionable xp stability, and a lock in to proprietary hardware and software...and we're paying $200 for this, no thank you and oh i know, the $80 x-fi, thats a good response because its such a good &quot;value&quot;, however it won't post to creative's performance &quot;level&quot; because it doesn't feature all of the extra garbage that x-fi ships with (like onboard dram (worthless)) additionally, i would never consider thg a viable source for talking about audio quality, lets consider: creative, hated by audiophiles and audio engineers everywhere for poor quality, poor drivers, and poor stability, along with a vastly overpriced and overinflated image of what a sound card should do, and unrealistic performance figures m-audio, the industry standard for prosumer recording and playback operations, granted, m-audio isn't digidesign or euphonix (far from it), but for the price nothing can compete with them, the revolution 5.1 and 7.1 depart to a degree from this studio design basis, however still share some features with the delta line, such as a commitment to affordable quality audio i'd say kid, but it would feel out of place, regardless, framerates, contrary to futuremark's marketing, are far from life, framerates are what marketing execs and dried up husks of tech news websites want us to pay through the teeth for, they don't reflect anything in regards to the hardware. yeah, an x-fi elite [whatever other over the top marketing terms] may get 2 fps higher than an m-audio revolution 7.1, it also costs about thrice as much, you'll never notice or see 2 fps in the real world, eax barely works so it isn't a valid competition point, and the m-audio sports hardware s/pdif out on the board, as well as 7.1 output, as well as equal dsp quality (or better), less power/heat, and a physically smaller package. sorry but creative's marketing may be good, but isn't good enough to defy the laws of audio quality
10502	7	260324	2564006	2563343	ramarc	8/16/07 7:47 am	1.18725042e12	wow, you don't believe benchmarks; how about developers?	you mentioned that f.e.a.r. doesn't support eax 3. that's odd because sierra's game page says different: recommended specifications: sound blaster x-fi series sound card  far cry's recommended sound card: sound blaster audigy series  i could go on but the bottom line is you're wrong. eax 2.0 is *minimum spec* and many games support the higher eax levels. go to an enthusiast site like hothardware.com or hardocp.com or anandtech.com and visit their forums. you'll see that real gamers who want the best hardware always choose creative cards. and the x-fi gamer does perform just as well as the other x-fi line. the xram feature is only used by 1 or 2 games and is primarily useful for audio apps (like sound forge).
10502	8	260324	2564015	2564006	ozos	8/16/07 8:00 am	1.1872512e12	try opening fear, and your eyes	1) companies, buy, endorsements, its been happening for years, you'll learn it eventually. 2) fear only supports eax 2.0, in game 3) refer to 1 and 2 in response to farcry as well 4) lets see: hothardware, not considered &quot;authority&quot; hardocp, the website that doesn't give performance figures in favor of &quot;the feeling of the hardware&quot;, also the subject of most enthusiast jokes anandtech, hardocp except the jokes aren't as catchy additionally, gamers rarely know a thing about system performance or hardware, they just buy what marketing execs wnat them to buy, along with those websites you've listed being hardware enthusiast websites, not gamer websites gaming websites would be: ign gamespot gamespy wow forums steam forums any number of clan forums and so on i'm done trying to defend my side to you, i'm guessing in the next 5 to 10 years you'll actually experience the hardware you're defending so valiantly, you'll experience the non-existant customer and software support it ships with, you'll realize that benchmarks aren't anything, and you'll stop following marketing... ...one can only hope
10502	9	260324	2564100	2564015	ramarc	8/16/07 10:08 am	1.18725888e12	all i can say is wow again	eax 2.0 is the minimum spec. just like with video cards, dx 9.0b/c my be the minimum spec but the game engine can choose an optimized path for specific hardware (e.g.: different shader model depending on the card). same with eax. but discussing this with you is pointless since you have your opinion and won't be changing it anytime soon. my only issue is that you just rail on and on with your opinion and don't back it up with any other citations. i don't give an opinion... i give advice and back it up with citations from other sources. hopefully anyone looking for a sound card (or any other hardware) will make their purchase decision based on information from a variety of sources rather than just a disgruntled opinion.
10502	10	260324	2564191	2564100	ozos	8/16/07 11:30 am	1.1872638e12	i'm not	giving an opinion either, i'm giving advice based on years of actual experience with the hardware being talked about, along with experience and advice from other colleagues (who have equally great experience with either the hardware in question, the software in question, or the industry in general), and over the years of dealing with creative products, the following has been learned: their drivers never work as advertised only recently have they started to create hardware that doesn't pop or hum when idling (and even then, some of their new hardware still does) only recently have they started to create hardware thats worth roughly half what it costs (compared to, oh lets say, awe32) eax is a worthless feature and a relic of a dying age of proprietary formats, and it belongs in the past along with a3d, glide, and other similar apis summarily i can say that while creative's products do work, they don't work as well as we'd like, and they don't provide the amazing leaps and bounds which their marketing lauds on them, they provide unrealisticly high expectations and rarely (if ever) deliever.
