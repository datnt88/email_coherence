<s> i used dvd shrink after dvd decryptor when capturing the files.  </s>
<s> when i was using dvd shrink it said there was an error so it couldn't burn it to nero?  </s>
<s> (i can't remember the exact wording)but all my files were shrunk properly and were fine to burn.  </s>
<s> just sharing.  </s>
<s> i didn't use dvd decryptor.  </s>
<s> just let dvdshrink backup my dvd.  </s>
