<s> i have a walkman nwz-a818 and it shows up in &quot;my computer&quot; like a hard drive.  </s>
<s> it doesn't have a letter though, but it's just like a hard drive and i can put any types of files onto it, make new folders and stuff.  </s>
<s> so, is it possible to run linux on it?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> you must be kidding.  </s>
<s> get a zune and install vista sp1.  </s>
<s> walkmans are dead and so is linux.  </s>
<s> you probably have an 8 track for sale (and a jethro tull tape to go with it).  </s>
<s> you can however install linux on some of the newer models of hoover.  </s>
<s> s  </s>
<s> i like to surf the net while i vacuumed...using linux if possible.  </s>
<s> you don't have a clue what this guy is asking, do you?  </s>
<s> your brain is dead.  </s>
<s> perhaps it got sucked out by the hoover.  </s>
<s> the last i heard...the early demise of linux is exaggerated.  </s>
