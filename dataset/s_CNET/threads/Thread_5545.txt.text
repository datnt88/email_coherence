what all things are needed to be considered before buying a nvidia geforce 7 series graphics card for the complete compatibility of it with the pc. my pc came with pre-installed nvidia geforce 6200 128 mb turbocache. and i'm planning to upgrade to nvidia geforce 7 series. my pc config : pc:- lenovo 3000 series q100 8822 11q intel pentium 4 3.06 ghz ht intel 945g chipset 2 gb ddr2-533 ram 80 gb hard disk nvidia geforce 6200 128 mb turbocache (currently installed graphic card) installed in pci express x16 windows xp home
1. the pcie x16 slot (which you have) 2. a suitably sized power supply. which you didn't state. that's about it. bob
how do i get to know about the details of the power supply. since the motherboard manufacturer and model is showing as :&quot;to be filled by oem&quot;. can u tell me any way to find the size or voltage of the power supply in my pc. but at the back of my cpu ,a sticker states &quot;dc +12v/4a&quot; is that the size of the power supply ?
so that's not it. there should be other numbers on the power supply. make/model usually helps. bob
you need to open the case and check the decal/sticker mounted on the power supply(psu) inside. hopefully, its visible and states what it is and specs. if not, its on the other side, do what you have to to inspect. if this is an oem(dell, gateway, etc) then look-up that model# on the respective support website and check for specs there, but even so, the decal should be present. most graphic card makers supply what the basic requirements are for its usage, again visit the support website for the model# in question. don't assume anything, check. for the most part, a decent 350w is required but system demands should be well served by at least a 400w psu of a brandname or better. tada -----willy
