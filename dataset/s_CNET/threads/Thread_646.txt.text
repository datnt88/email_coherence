i read on another board something about the intel macbook pro having wireless n capability. i curently run a wireless g router. does anyone know anything about making the macbook pro n-compatible?
ii did a quick bit of research at the apple store and it woud seem tht only the macbook pro has a wireless card that is capable of &quot;n&quot;, via a firmware update. you might want to call apple to confirm/deny that. i could not find anywhere that specifically stated that the macbook could not be updated. p
it would be a monumental blunder to make a n only card. all such cards have b and g capability or else no mac could use free wifi hotspots. think about it. bob
a suggestion anywhere in this thread. the macbook pro has the capability, not turned on when shipped, of using the n protocol. i believe the airport extreme base station and the newer imacs also have the capability to use n but need the firmware update to turn it on. p
ooops. someone had just asked me about using the mbp's n card on their g router.
