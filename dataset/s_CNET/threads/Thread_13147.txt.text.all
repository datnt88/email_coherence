<s> i have an older 74gb 10,000rpm raptor drive with a 1.5gb sata connection and a 2tb 7200rpm with a 6gb sata connection. the raptor has much faster read and seek times, but a smaller cache and smaller bandwidth to the mobo.  </s>
<s> what to to???  </s>
<s> the usual result is seek times trump the faster transfer rates.  </s>
<s> i can install on both and compare the boot times... i've spent wnough on this project as it is, but the other option is to bye a solid state drive for the sole purpose of hosting win 7  </s>
<s> i've seen some users go the ssd route and are happy as long as everything is working.  </s>
<s> that's not a given, as the ssd drive can crap-out with no clue that it would. the usual cure is to replace the drive.  </s>
<s> overall, imo it works well other than what i stated.  </s>
<s> recovery of any data is on par for any device like a flash drive.  </s>
<s> for now though, i would recommend continued use of a sata type hd.  </s>
<s> they're at the top of they're form and seem to be just as good as ssd minus the speed.  </s>
<s> however, that speed difference isn't going to really be noticed until intensive tasks like audio&video editing may come into it.  </s>
<s> as for game play, that too isn't all that impressive.  </s>
<s> game forums/websites aren't really pushing ssd other than bragging rights.  </s>
<s> however, for os usage, it works well.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i appreciate that info willie, i'll probably stick with one of the sata drives for now if not only for $$$ purposes... did you have any opinion or technical reasons for me to decide on the raptor drive or the 6bg sata drive?  </s>
<s> 6gb i/f is the highest level and if your pc supports it why not use it.  </s>
<s> until the corrected sandy bridge and complete chipsets arrive, other mtrbd.  </s>
<s> chipsets will do and they do good.  </s>
<s> since, you have 6gb ability and if hd is capable, use it.  </s>
<s> i see no reason, not to at least i don't.  </s>
<s> if you do some reviewing and checking, imo most users just don't see great improvements, however it is there.  </s>
<s> if it was my system i tend to lean towards stability/reliability issues.  </s>
<s> my tasks are simple or relatively so, so i'm easily pleased.  </s>
<s> but, if some spec means more to you, then get it.  </s>
<s> i don't think i can expand anymore on the topic.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> thanks very much  </s>
