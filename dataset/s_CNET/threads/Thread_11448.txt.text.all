<s> 1. this is my computer: is it possible to keep my processor, dvd drives, hard drives, etc. and simply upgrade the motherboard?  </s>
<s> i'd like to get one that has an agp or pci-e slot to upgrade my vid card... 2. i'm also looking at a new dvd burner, one that will support dvd-ram.  </s>
<s> it may seem like a silly question, but will a drive like this read dvd-ram as well?  </s>
<s> reason i ask is that i have a hitachi dvd camcorder that won't connect to my computer.  </s>
<s> i'd like to just take my dvd-ram discs from it and plop them into a drive on my pc to transfer them.  </s>
<s> will this work?  </s>
<s> thanks, eric  </s>
<s> but keep in mind sometimes the os doesn't run on the new machine and sometimes the os is locked to dell hardware.  </s>
<s> as to dvd-ram, yes if that is noted on the new drive.  </s>
<s> best of luck, bob  </s>
<s> and you could also get a pci firewire card if that's what you need for the camera work.  </s>
<s> does your system manual show what slots there are in the mb ?  </s>
<s> just follow the link, it'll show you what's available on the mobo.  </s>
<s> has anyone replaced a board on a dell 2400?  </s>
<s> any recommendations?  </s>
