long story short i had to enable wpa 2 on my home network. i've tried this once before bu took it off when one of my computers did not allow me to enable wpa 2 on it. i have3 home computers: the main one is running vista and he other 2 are both xp (i know that doesn't make a difference). and they both have wireless cards. both linksys. one is linksys wmp11 ver 2.1, and the other is a linksys wmp54gs ver 1.4. no the latter supports wpa 2 on its setup tab. i am able to enter the password and it works fine. but the other, the wmp11, is a older card and does not list wpa 2 in the drop down list. however when using xp's wireless connection window, it tells me that it found a signal and that its wpa 2 encrypted. so i open it up, type in the password, it shows a connecting window, and then just goes away after a minute. no error messages, nothing. and i still can't get connected on that computer. i've also downloaded the patch from microsoft enabling wpa 2, but i can't seem to get it to work. i've tried everything short of downloading sp 3, which one person said would help. is there something i'm missing with xp's wpa 2 patch? is there a way to do this? (i'd but a new card but i'm short on money)
but please tell why wpa isn't good enough. we note this in our forum sticky and have yet to find a good reason to move to wpa 2. bob
honestly i cant tell you, i just know that wpa 2 has better security. if wpa will do the same then i'll use that insead. which encryption should i use tkip or aes? i've read that wpa is just as good as wpa 2 but harder to set up right.
and that question is one for the ages. i will share i use the router defaults. let's go with the forum admonishment and advice first. let's not repeat all the discussions about tkip or aes. in other words, do you want it to work?
thats all i've been trying to do. get it to work but be secure.
there is no exploit noteworthy today for wpa that won't take months and months at banging away at your network.
