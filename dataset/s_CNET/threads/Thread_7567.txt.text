the opeating system is windows xp. the floppy drive is working properly, but when i insert a disk into the a drive it is not detected. how do i get the computer to read the disk?
data cable connected firmly to drive and motherboard? data cable connected backwards? power cable connected to drive? did the drive ever work properly? does the drive appear in the bios? if not you need to change some bios settings. i assume this is a standard internal 3.5&quot; floppy drive and not a usb drive or 5.25 floppy drive. correct?
you have to initiate a floppy drive. go to &quot;my computer&quot; and select the drive simply by clicking on it.
check your bios settings to see if the onboard floppy drive controller is enabled.
i figured they weren't realizing that a floppy isn't automatically executed when it is inserted in a floppy drive like a cd/dvd is when it is inserted into a cd/dvd drive.
