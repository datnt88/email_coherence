<s> i have a smartdisk usb 2.0 bus powered portable 40 gb notebook hdd.  </s>
<s> although it has the smartdisk brand on it creative has exactly the same product as creative usb hdd. the problem is that, no matter which usb port i plug the device in, xp keeps saying that it's not plugged into a usb 2.0 port and the device works really slow (at usb 1.1 speed).  </s>
<s> i tried the device with a number of desktops and notbeooks, and with every usb port on these computers, but always got the same result.  </s>
<s> the device has a &quot;y&quot; shaped plug going into the computer, that is two usb plugs parallel.  </s>
<s> i think one of them is for draining power from another usb port if the main doesn't have enough power.  </s>
<s> that's what i experienced using the plugs in combinations.  </s>
<s> it works with the main one plugged in only .  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> the device with the y is likely an usb 1.1 hub.  </s>
<s> upgrade that.  </s>
<s> if i didn't understand this proper, please supply a link or picture of the products.  </s>
<s> in closing, many laptops don't have usb 2.0 ports.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> sorry, i led to a misunderstanding.  </s>
<s> i was referring to the usb harddisk by &quot;device&quot;.  </s>
<s> so, there is only a hdd with it's cable.  </s>
<s> i couldn't find the cable but here is the description fron it's specs: cable(s) included 1 usb cable external cables included qty 1 cables form factor external cables type usb cable i tried the hdd with many new desktops, that i am sure they have usb 2.0 ports.  </s>
<s> xp keeps saying i'd better plug into another port.. here is the link to the manufacturer's web page: (as a matter of fact, noon technology co., ltd., china is manufacturing the ide-to-usb and the case) thanks  </s>
<s> if that is so, then go with what works. the alternative is to return the product as defective.  </s>
