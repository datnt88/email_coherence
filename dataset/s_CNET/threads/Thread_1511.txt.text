recently i have had some problems with my presario desktop computer overheating out of control. it idles at around 60 degrees celsius and gets over 80 degrees celsius when loading just about anything. here are the specs for my computer: motherboard name
here is a screen shot of the madness lol [img]  [/img]
are no longer touched by most repair shops. the care and feeding of the cpu is well known so i won't write any words about heatsinks or compound as you can google that. but if the machine just needs to get more life i find disabling the l1 and l2 cache to cure random crashes at the expense of speed. it's sad to read you have yet to refresh the heatsink compound. bob
have you tried a slot cooler. i surmised from your specs you have at least one pci slot open for this addition. just an example. read the comments.
