why is it that my wireless d-link network says it is connected but when i look at the workgroup page in the network folder none of my computers are listed there?
i could tell a story about a company the went down in flames since their product idea relied on their concept of how nn (network neighborhood) worked. frankly, nn is less than reliable. there are many arcane rules about how it works, when it populates and when it forgets. the time between refreshes is from 10 minutes to weeks and is somewhat configurable. to work around all this i just use the net view command line. it's a minor skill you should work on. -&gt; then again, you could have a firewall installed. bob
i have turned the firewall i have off and have been using net view but still nothing shows up.
enabled file sharing on the systems and opened any folders to sharing? dw
but then it said &quot;check your privilages, make sure file & print sharing are turned on&quot; &quot;network path not found&quot; when i had enabled file sharing (very annoying). i will try renaming both pc's and renaming the workgroup to try to help. how hard is it to setup a domain network?
