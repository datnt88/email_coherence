which media center pc is the best for the living room? i would like to be able to record tv, burn on dvd, play games on my hdtv, and stream mp3's, movies, and pics. any thoughts on if they are good enough yet or which brand? thanks. mnjhouston
go with shuttle, quiet, compact, and can game really good even in such a small case.
build your own. newegg offers barebone pcs. if you've got the money, go for an intel pentium m with a good shuttle case.
