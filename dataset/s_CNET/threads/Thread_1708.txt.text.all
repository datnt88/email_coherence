<s> hi, i was playing a game and i noticed that my pc was alot louder than normal so i turned of the pc, cleaned it and during the process i noticed that the graphic card was extremely hot. the next day when i turned on my pc my monitor would not display anything even though the pc light is on and fans too.  </s>
<s> i assumed it might be my monitor so i replaced it with another and it still wouldnt display it.  </s>

<s> gpu cards are a major source of heat.  </s>
<s> they too are prone to any heat stress.  </s>
<s> which is why i often offer that any gamers provide the cooling needed.  </s>
<s> all too often though this is an after thought.  </s>
<s> it maybe already too late, the video card has faltered.  </s>
<s> if you haven't already, remove gpu card and clean it as well directly.  </s>
<s> once returned and fully seated, that its fan is working as well.  </s>
<s> if the display doesn't come back, remove from pc. enter your pc and find the cmos clearing pins/pads and return the pc to defaults.  </s>
<s> it should allow you on next boot to enter the bios(does display) and re-enter any bios changes that need be required and save upon exit.  </s>
<s> now, it if work then, do a shutdown.  </s>
<s> return gpu card and see if it accepts it or follow prompts.  </s>
<s> you may need to do a re-install or accept new h/w.  </s>
<s> hopefully, if it accept the old gpu card and you reboot and it works, great.  </s>
<s> if not and no display, you have a bad gpu card.  </s>
<s> of course, you can test on another pc, if able.  </s>
