i have a &quot;d-link&quot; cable router with 4 port. i have 2 pc's, both xp-home and an xbox. i've had no problems for about 2 years until yesterday when an error message said &quot;cable not connected&quot;. same message on all 3. i checked all the cables and they worked fine when not using the router. i saw a reset button on the router, nothing. what should i look at now? a new router? i'm hoping someone has an idea. thanks
would be to go to the d-link site. they have excellent support. you may have corrupted firmware, and newer may be available. good luck, click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. suppose you were an idiot. . . and suppose you were a member of congress. . . but i repeat myself. --mark twain
three devices at the same time would lead me to suspect a common source. swap the router.
