<s> i'm getting an asus essentio cg5275-ar003 that i will be using for gaming.  </s>
<s> but i want to get a video card for it seen as it only has an integrated card.  </s>
<s> i'm already shellin out 700 bucks for the computer so i cant spend to much on the card only 100-150.  </s>
<s> i dont know much about the subject so please help.  </s>
<s> choose your pick from .  </s>
<s> it's up to you to decide between high-quality or mainstream.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> i just need some advice.  </s>
<s> i dont even know where to start. the site you gave me doesn't help because i know nothing about any video cards.  </s>
<s> maybe a link to a video card buying guide would be more helpful  </s>
<s> is our own review section.  </s>
<s> that might be somewhat more intelligeable.  </s>
<s> and i would say, first have a look at the system requirements of the games you want to play. it could be they play well enough using the integrated graphics.  </s>
<s> if not, you'll learn the minimum requirements you need.  </s>
<s> even if the motherboard comes with integrated graphics, you can add a videocard of your choice later.  </s>
<s> so there's no need to decide now.  </s>
<s> why not postpone your decision?  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> thanks for the advice.  </s>
<s> i'd planned on trying the onboard one first.  </s>
<s> but just thought id figure out which one i would get if the performance isn't up to my standards.  </s>
