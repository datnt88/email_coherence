i'd like to upgrade my sony pcv-rx650, which currently has the original 80gb ata/100 hd and 512mb ram(though i'm upgrading memory as well). i'd like to add a second internal hard drive of 200-250 gb capacity, if possible. what, if any issues might i have? from what i understand, ata/100 or ata/133 doesn't really matter. i see some of the drives (maxtor ultra 7200 series) require and additional pci card slot. what are the benefits/negatives versus a drive that doesn't require an additional card slot? all slots are currently occupied, unless i remove the fax/telephony card which isn't used anyway. any suggestions on drives/brands? thanks!
what operating system (and service pack number) are you using? if you are using windows xp, you need to at least have service pack 1 (sp1) installed to use hard drives over 137gb. i have not experienced any major differences between ata/100 and ata/133. your motherboard is ata/100; however, you still can install an ata/133 drive. it will be compatible. you have two ata slots on the motherboard, each capable of handling two drives (making four total). maxtor wants you to spend money on an ata hard drive controller card that supports ata/133 if your integrated ata hard drive controller is only ata/100. it is not required/necessary. another issue i see is finding space to insert the drive inside that case. try not stack one hard drive directly on top of another with, say, only a cm between them. heat is the enemy of computer components, including hard drives. if you have a free 5.25'' drive bay, you could put the drive there as an option. if you ever have to install a pci card for any reason, you can use combination cards to fit all of your functionality. for example, you can have usb, firewire, and a 10/100 network port all on one pci card.
windows xp home sp2. there is a second 3.5'' hard drive bay, but it does place it very close to the other hard drive. no free 5.25'' bays. thanks.
