<s> i just bought a hard drive which was shipped to me.  </s>
<s> living in the upper midwest, the weather has been 20 deg farenheight during the days that the hard drive was in transit.  </s>
<s> when i checked the manufacturer web site regarding maintaining the drive properly, they say not to keep the drive below 40 degrees.  </s>
<s> 1)have i put the hard drive at risk by shipping it in this extrememely cold weather which contradicts the manufacturer recomended temperature?  </s>
<s> 2)can shipping an item like a hard drive in a small box as it was shipped from the retailer, jeapardize the inegrity of it?  </s>
<s> then you avoid the usual damage.  </s>
<s> sorry but this will be my only reply as i find folk fret a lot about this and i can't repeat long discussions about why moisture is bad.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> being shipped in cold temps shouldn't be a problem as long as you give it a couple of hours to get to normal room temperature before trying to use it.  </s>
<s> when not in use, the read/write heads will be docked away from the platters to keep from having problems.  </s>
<s> i've seen folks ruin hard drives by trying to operate them when they're too cold though.  </s>
<s> the platters in the disk drives are made with a metallic base which expands and contracts with temp changes, so you do need to be careful not to operate them when they're outside of the manufacturer's specifications.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
