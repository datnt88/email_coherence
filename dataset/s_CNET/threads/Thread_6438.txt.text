hi, i'm looking to build a new pc for entertainment/media purposes, especially gaming. i've pretty much specced my pc, but i'm currently looking into speakers (i don't like to use headphones). anyone have any suggestions as to which i should purchase?
i have had great experiences with both, but i have not had good experiences with bose. just my 2 cents.
totally agree with james, logitech makes some really good stuff for computers, creative as well. i use a logitech system and am well pleased plus they don't cost you an arm and a leg. their other peripherals are also excellent, keyboards and mice, joysticks etc. all of my peripherals on all systems are logitech.
try out the new ambx stuff from phillips, speakers included. should add something new to your gaming rig! logitech and creative do some good stuff, but not quite like this
