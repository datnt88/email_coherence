yup thats right im done with it but im not really sure if i should be. see i have a pretty nice nvidia sli rdy mobo and a evga 7800 gtx it justs i have never really been impressed with my graphics. like most of the time when i play games i get this kind of graphic ripple on the screen or maybe alittle studdering and thats not even really playing games like fear witch has a kind of slow motion drag of the graphics with it and now im thinking i should have went with a ati gpu. but if i did lets says buy a x1900xt cf and new psu then a new ati crossfire mobo in the future should i exspect better performance then what i have now or would it all be the same? thanks for the help, nick
dont blame the graphics card as it could be from other factors that you are experiencing these problems. have u thought about overheating? or say a faulty graphics card which u couldve rma'd. how about listing the specs on your computer? and graphic ripple? what do u mean by this? and u said that u would buy a new psu if u get an ati card? so i am assuming u know u already have a lack of power? now i may be wrong...
lol sorry i forgot x2 4800 2 gbs of xms ram evga 7800 gtx 256 gpu 500watt psu nvidia nforce4 sli rdy mobo and 5 total fans and about the psu no i think mine is fine im just going to get a new one for future needs. about the ripple it kind of looks like a line where the graphics are all messed up like srambled idk. altogether i know something has to be wrong cause a 500+ gpu card cant be this crappy. thanks again, nick
what settings have u got on the games? maybe there set to high? have u tried turning down the settings? maybe try returning the card and getting another one? latest drivers? ya, seems like it is the video card.
