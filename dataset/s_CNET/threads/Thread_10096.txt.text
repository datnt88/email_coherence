for some reason, when i attach my external hard drive via usb 2.0, windows(xp w/ sp2) installs the driver(s), tells me the hardware is installed and ready to use, but when i open my computer to access my files in the hard drive, there is no f: drive present. all that shows up is my cdrw/dvd drive, c:, and memory stick drive. what can i do to access my information? it is vital for work, and every second i'm without the information on it is costly.
i took my old hard drive out of my old laptop and put it in a case to use as an external hard drive for my new laptop and i installed the software and it said it was working, then i went into my computer and its not there. i have the right case for it and software, and the cables are not broken so i don't know whats wrong. si.
given that all other things are equal... you may have to &quot;activate&quot; the drive. go to my computer in windows explorer and right click. click on &quot;manage&quot;. under &quot;storage&quot; click on &quot;disk management&quot;. now look for the drive and make sure it's &quot;activated&quot;. if not activate it. hope this works for you. and life goes on... jack
