this morning i tried turning my desktop pc on and it wouldn't boot. no power light on, and on closer inspection the fan turns feebly for half a second or so, then it all stops. i have tried unplugging the power cable and plugging it in again, which has worked before with this issue, but no luck this time. any suggestions of what this could be? how do i fix it?
you better answers provide full details of your pc as best as possible. repeat you past remedy, unplug ac cord for 10min. and then retry. if that doesn't work then that suggests your psu is bad, replace with similar or more wattage unit. you should inspect the insides very closely for any &quot;bad caps&quot; issue, google for examples and it needn't be a real bad failure. more than likely its a bad psu, excluding any other fault. since, you've experienced this before usually means it was going until a total failure. tada -----willy
is it new.....is it old ? big box pc or clone ? changed the cmos battery lately ? vapcmd
(1) try to clear the cmos. there is a cmos jumper (2 or 3 pin header) on the motherboard. e.g. for a 2pin header, closing the pins could clear & open could be normal function. depending on what motherboard you have got, the story could be the other way round. (2) check your memory. if the memory is short, the pc turns for half a sec & stops. (3) remove the cpu. put it back after 2 to 3mins. (4) try another power supply unit.
unplugging a few things first. in a situation like this i would unplug all hard drives, cd/dvd drives, and pull out all memory. then try to start computer. if it starts with everything unplugged, then turn it off and try plugging in devices one at a time, restarting after each device to determine where the problem lies. if it won't fire after unplugging all of these items, you have at least eliminated several possible problems.
