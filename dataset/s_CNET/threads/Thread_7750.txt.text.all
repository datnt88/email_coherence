<s> there's a computer in my house that has a motherboard that can support both legacy sdram, and ddr1 ram can both types be used together, or are you forced to stick to one type?  </s>
<s> the types of memory you can put into a machine is dictated by the motherboard and what it supports.  </s>
<s> just because it fits doesn't mean it will work.  </s>
<s> you have more research ahead of you as i know of boards that support both but not at the same time.  </s>
<s> read that manual to see what your board does.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> with mbs that have slots for more than one ram type, you can run one ram type or the other .... not both.  </s>
