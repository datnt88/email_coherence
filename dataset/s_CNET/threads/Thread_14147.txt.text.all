<s> thanks for the reply... well i have this one disc i got to try and get the password but i can't even set the boot menu to run on that drive so that it will work at startup.  </s>
<s> since the keyboard freezes up...  </s>
<s> i moved the hard disk to a properly working machine and booted ntpasswd to reset the passwords.  </s>
<s> i never booted that hard disk in another machine (very important!) put the hard disk back into the original machine and i was done.  </s>
<s> sorry to hear your machine needs repair.  </s>
<s> did you call dell while it was in warranty to have them correct this error?  </s>
