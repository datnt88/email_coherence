<s> hey, everybody.  </s>
<s> i was wondering if someone could help me out with this problem.  </s>
<s> i bought a brand-new samsung ml-2010 laser printer from buy.com about a month and a half ago, and i've been having this recurring issue with it. the printer worked like a charm for the first few weeks, but now its useless. the problem used to pop up here and there, but now i cant print anything at all.  </s>
<s> basically, every time i turn on the printer, it warms up (or attempts to) and after a few seconds, the red error light starts blinking.  </s>
<s> if i try to print a document, i get a message saying that theres been a fuser error.  </s>
<s> i dont know what that is, and samsungs troubleshooting utility didn't give me anything beyond the ol turn it off, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on.  </s>
<s> if that doesnt work, contact a service representative method.  </s>
<s> i havent been able to find any solutions on samsungs support site, and nothing helpful came up when i googled the terms samsung fuser error (or variants).  </s>
<s> if anyone has any useful information at all, id really appreciate it.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance!  </s>
<s> fyi, im using: toshiba satellite a55-s326 notebook intel pentium m 1.6 ghz 512 mb ram (shared video memory) windows xp home sp2 usb 2.0 connection to printer starter toner cartridge (it came with the printer)  </s>
<s> a fuser problem is serious but since this is a new printer, use the warranty now.  </s>
<s> don't play with it as more than likely you can't recover and you *may void* the warranty in any attempts, so use the warranty.  </s>
<s> you should have returned it immediately once the problem cropped-up to be within the quicker satifaction settlement period, you may now have to deal with a warranty center if not the vendor themselves for repair, but start the process.  </s>
<s> plus, document this as well, cal,s letters, etc. to best serve yourself if any other problems arise.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i had the same issue, but right after the warranty ran out.  </s>
<s> my mac can see the printer, but nothing prints, and the two front-panel lights blink in unison.  </s>
<s> talked to a sales rep for a mail-order place and she chuckled and implied that this is all-too-common with this series.  </s>
<s> she suggested an hp as a replacement.  </s>
<s> so much for samsung...  </s>
<s> i don't know if parts are readily available for fixing the ml. the good news is the 2010 is so darn cheap its just as good to buy new as any repair costs.  </s>
<s> the same for hp, especially low end models.  </s>
<s> i believe the ml-2010 is under $100 online maybe better to google away for a source.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i have had more than 7 of these printers.. bought on sale at buy.com and staples... and given to family members and friends.. sadly the story is always the same.  </s>
<s> at first they work fine.. but in as little as a week or two you either get fuser error which is the kiss of death... or the paper jam light as the paper goes halfway in and then just stops.  </s>
<s> now i've spoken to samsung about this and they just stonewall you!! exactly what i mean by that is any solution generally costs more than what you paid for the printer new!  </s>
<s> i had the fuser error after no more than 30 prints total on the machine and since it was a new machine but had been sitting unopened in the box for over a year samsung would do nothnig except talk in circles telling me to pay more than it cost new!! remember... this was after only 30 prints total on the machine!!!! i think there should be a public youtube video session of people taking samsung products and throwing them out the window, smashing below,.. to the music/soundtrack of their customer support giving useless excuses that cost more than the product did in the first place.  </s>
<s> i've written to three different addresses for higher up help at samsung and they have never got back to me.  </s>
<s> samsung usa is managed by korean transplants who seem not to care the way you might expect an executive from a us firm would.  </s>
<s> their corporate culture apparently is aloof and unresponsive to consumer sentiments.  </s>
