hello guys! i have a problem here. the network at my house worked like this:  everything was working fine. both computers could share files and i could use the internet using windows ics. but yesterday i bough a pcmcia evdo card for my laptop. and since i installed it both computers cannot share files or my laptop can use the shared internet connection.  the computers can &quot;see&quot; each other, but when i try to see the files from one computer the system says the pc is unreachable. even the shared connection appears on the laptop, but when i try to use ie or firefox they say you can't connect. is there a way to fix this? i'd like to know if there is a way my network could work like this: 1 - pc uses the adsl broadband connection 2 - laptop uses pcmcia card when not in the local network 3 - laptop uses adsl shared broadband connection when in the local network 4 - laptop and pc shar files thanks in advance!!!!!
an evdo service provider? i'm not sure why you bought evdo? you need a router instead. if evdo were your primary internet connection it could be shared by an evdo router. the only way it could connect to a lan would be by vpn.
the evdo is for my laptop. it is a pcmcia card. i can connect to the internet wherever i want. i bought it for mobile use (laptop). but since i installed it i can't connect to my pc via cable. got it? thanks
creating a second hardware profile on the laptop for use at home?
ok! i will try that!
