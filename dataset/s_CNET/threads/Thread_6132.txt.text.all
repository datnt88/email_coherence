<s> as bob proffitt said, the p-touch units are a really good way to go.  </s>
<s> you can do labels with an all in one or a stand alone printer but i am still in favor of the p-touch they are, in my opinion, easier to use and in the long run more cost effective, especially over an inkjet unit.  </s>
<s> how many labels do you plan to print?  </s>
<s> this will greatly narrow down your selection.  </s>
<s> further, the s/w yu use can be a great help as it can when using &quot;label sheets&quot; typical of any printer use will enhance where it prints if you say, half of the labels present.  </s>
<s> -or- if you use a rool, again the s/w can replicate the output to your needs.  </s>
<s> while a p-type printer will do good, these are not intended for continuous usage but short output.  </s>
<s> gain, you need to suit your needs to the printer is being used for.  </s>
<s> also, using a p-type printer the paper rolls aren't cheap as well for any brand.  </s>
