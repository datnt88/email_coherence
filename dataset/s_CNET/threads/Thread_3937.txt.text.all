<s> i am considering buying a lcd wide screen monitor but i don't want a circle to look oblong.  </s>
<s> will the computer compensate for the wider screen and keep the same aspect ratio as i had with the standard monitor?  </s>
<s> the software you use will have to do that.  </s>
<s> for example, i don't have an issue with browsers or irfanview.  </s>

<s> on your video card.  </s>
<s> my main pc's video card has a lot of resolution options and i was able to find one that worked.  </s>
<s> my other pc's video card did not have the proper resolution and the screen was stretched.  </s>
<s> a wide screen monitor will need something like 1440 x 900 resolution (wide screen).  </s>
<s> if your video card does not have this available, you'll get a stretched picture.  </s>
<s> thank you, coryphaeus!  </s>
<s> i've been suffering with elongated images since i &quot;inherited&quot; an hpw19 from my son.  </s>
<s> (it came with his new computer.  </s>
<s> he couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.) i switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now i have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display.  </s>
<s> beautiful.  </s>
<s> should i tell my son?  </s>
<s> thanks again, ron  </s>
<s> thanks !  </s>
<s> you solved my problem with a 22.5&quot; wide screen monitor.  </s>
