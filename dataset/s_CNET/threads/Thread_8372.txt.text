hi i plan to replace my comqaq 5 year old computer soon.i have a fairly new video card (nvidia)and dvd/cd-rom (sony)that i have installed. i would like to save them for future use.is it ok to save them in a plastic zip bag? if not, what else? joe
go to your local pc fix-it shop and request a couple of esd/anti-static bags. they have a trash can full of those things, so if they want more than a couple of bucks.....leave. you could probably store them in a cardboard box, just ground yourself before you touch the things.
thanks will do. i plan to buy the computer at combination new systems and repairs store good idea thanks joe
