i'm going to build a media center pc and i bought the logitech harmony 880 universal remote [ ]. what is the best hdtv tv tuner card to use? 
i was told that i need to get a tv tuner card that comes with a remote and ir (infrared) receiver so that the harmony 880 is able to control the functions for the media center pc. could someone please suggest a good hdtv tuner card that you've used or know of. 
thank you 
forgot to add that i'm building it with vista 64bit home premium because i was told that i can also use vista instead of xp media center. 
stick with 32bit for better tv tuner options: check out hauppauge cards and bundles: and pinnacle's usb hdtv stick: remote: 
thank you for the links much appreciated
