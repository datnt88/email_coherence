i just purchased a new laptop and since it has no parallel ports, i tried purchasing a usb to parallel printer cable. after hours of installing, uninstalling drivers i've run out of ideas trying to get the printer connected. after a re-boot, if i print a test page, it turns the printer on, but never prints the document. anyone have any experience with this printer on a usb port, workcentre xd130df? anyone have any ideas how i can connect to this printer with the laptop? print server have a better shot? thanks in advance. dell vostro 1500 xp home
mine were from belkin and a no-name. worked find with xp. however the vostro is fairly new. i wonder if you or dell installed xp? bob
dell installed the xp.
i named the make of an adapter i used. it worked but i don't have your printer.  is another thought. try other parallel adapters. and finally a parallel port for your laptop?  bob
didn't think to see if a parallel card was made for a laptop. very helpful.. thanks-
