anyone know where i can find a transformer for a set of logitech x540 speakers? logitech says they don't sell them. tiger direct and newegg are also no gos.
and many other pictures do not show this component. my bet is you'll have to buy a second x540 off ebay. that's not a bad deal since power bricks could run that much! bob
try going to radio shack see if there is a universal adapter kit that might work. the critical points are the input fitting (size) and dc voltage, best to take them with if you decide to try this. oddly enough i had an old scanner laying around a while back and the inverter had gone south, went to radio shack, did a match up and it worked. just a thought. again, the fitting and voltage (dc) are the critical issues.
