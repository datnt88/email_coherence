hi there, i've got a friend with a generic pc put together with heaven knows what (no brand names). he said it was working just fine, then one day stopped. it looks to me like the pc just isn't booting up. when you turn on the power, the hard drive light comes on for about 30 seconds or so, then nothing. it doesn't sound like it's going through any post or any kind of startup and there's no signal to the monitor. what are the most common causes of this kind of problem and what should i be checking? thanks to everyone/anyone in advance for their replies and advice. regards, --- gary
what is usually done is the monitor is tried on a working machine and a working monitor tried on the failed machine. causes are simple. age, heat, and broken parts. the trick for home repair is to guess which part. for home repair this can be tough since you might not have a spare video card to see if that was it. bob
hi bob, thanks for your response. it's not the monitor or the video card. i did try another monitor just for the heck of it and there was no change. but the problem is not simply that i'm not getting a display. the problem is that the pc does not appear to be booting at all. it has power, but there is no startup activity; no beeps; no flashing lights on the keyboard; no sound of activity on the hard drive or floppy drive, etc. i was just wondering if this was specifically indicitave of anything obvious, such as a bad motherboard. the only thing i've tried so far was removing the memory chip and disconnecting the hard drive (no difference). thanks. regards, --- gary
no monitor required. four parts... cpu/hsf (heatsinkfan) motherboard psu (power supply unit) speaker. nothing else. no cards, memory, keyboard, ide cables.. nothing but the 4 parts. no beeps means you've narrowed it down to those four parts. bob
