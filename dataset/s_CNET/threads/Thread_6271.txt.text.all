<s> according to this article ( ), the 1080p mb168b+ monitor is supposed to be released during august, but i can't find much information about it online.  </s>
<s> has anyone heard anything?  </s>
<s> sales seem to be nowhere and blogs and makers try and try again.  </s>
<s> seems like a niche product since no one reports they can play video on such things.  </s>
<s> maybe with usb 3.0 that will finally let you watch a movie but if you have seem the average notebook tank on performance my bet is that folk will again go back to hdmi.  </s>
<s> besides, without hdcp, your average bluray title will not play on this.  </s>

<s> i'm really interested in something like this for work.  </s>
<s> i would use it mostly for excel, word, pdf viewing/editing, etc. i would just prefer a monitor with a resolution higher than 1366 x 768 like the 16&quot; aoc monitor out there.  </s>
<s> the other downside is the cost.  </s>
<s> being a niche product you pay a premium.  </s>
<s> if you just want a second display, a common monitor is the cheap fix.  </s>
<s> almost all laptops will do a dual display. the wallet is usually the decider here.  </s>
<s> for me, i'd give usb 3.0 displays a wide berth since drivers are still iffy.  </s>
<s> you don't want to know the stories.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> sorry, i wasn't very clear.  </s>
<s> i travel frequently for work, and i do the bulk of my work at client locations and in hotel rooms.  </s>
<s> so i need a monitor that's travel friendly.  </s>
<s> i'm having trouble finding non-usb monitors that are very travel friendly and have a higher resolution.  </s>
<s> do you have any suggestions for a good travel monitor that is approx 16 inches and isn't just a usb-connected monitor?  </s>
<s> for example.  </s>
<s> but given your story, why not go for it and be clear about your return options?  </s>
<s> i didn't want to name names but the usual 4 letter makers has had some issues with usb 3.0 bob  </s>
