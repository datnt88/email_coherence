<s> i bought a samsung mp3 for my son, age 8. it had a higher customer rating than ipod.  </s>
<s> so did alot of others.  </s>
<s> it has more functions and memory than ipod.  </s>
<s> never skips, cracks or jumps like some of the ipod reports i've read that say ipod does.  </s>
<s> we never had a problem of any kind.  </s>
<s> it's easy for my son to us and for me to load.  </s>
<s> and priced 25% cheaper for ipod's same type.  </s>
<s> yu-11 player is fabulous compared to the rest.  </s>
<s> when my son stated it had to be a mp3 and not ipod, i was a little confused.  </s>
<s> i thought there only was ipod.  </s>
<s> he said everyone had ipod and it was crap.  </s>
<s> he wanted a good one.  </s>
<s> come to find out he was right.  </s>
<s> but if you go to a retail store, you would think ipod is all that exists.  </s>
<s> why is this? are we such a &quot;shop faddy socity&quot; that we don't &quot;care to compare&quot; anymore?  </s>
<s> or is there a retail corruption, tring to steer our purchases?  </s>
<s> where is your networking question?  </s>
<s> a high percentage of people like that model.  </s>
<s> if you don't, then buy something else.  </s>
<s> -&gt; where's the network or wireless question here?  </s>

<s> while i tend to agree, the fact is apple owns the market for mp3 players.  </s>
<s> my first player was a dell dj, and it was good, if not great mp3 player.  </s>
<s> but if you want any versatility with from a player, the ipod is the only way to go because there are literally tons of accessories available.  </s>
<s> although, the dj is well represented in terms of accessories, most are only available on-line from dell and a few other vendors.  </s>
<s> but you can go to almost any type of store and find ipod accessories.  </s>
<s> from docks to cases to car stereo integration to boom boxes, there appears to be no end to the options and versatility for the ipod.  </s>
<s> nothing beats having my music library with me at all times, whether that be in the car, while shopping at sams, or while working out - all with the same player.  </s>
