(pipeline, and a few other points were made). based on the above information, needing a pci express video card, keeping it under 200.00, (in fact 150 - 170 would be great) what will give me the best bang for the buck, and comfort knowing we should be able to play most games for the next couple of years. also, why the same geforce numbers, but often a huge difference in price from pny, bfg, msi and the many others out there, for quality should i be looking at a lower number, but buying from the best company? (seems like a dumb question now that i have typed it) got to be some gamers out here that can offer some opinions. thanks

(geforce 6600gt is close to the 7600gs, but why buy a 2003 gpu when a 2006 gpu is the same price?) 7300gts come in a wide range of speeds and a fast one is close to a 7600gs. x1600pro is comparable to slow 7300gt. x1300pros don't have the horsepower for modern games. i assume your son will be thrilled with a new pc that can play bf2 even if some settings have to turned down. since the 7300gt card i recommend is in the same performance ballpark as a 7600gs/x1600xt, i recommend you get the $85 card and upgrade in 12-18 months. by then, a 7800gt/x1800xt will be in the $120 price range. $170: geforce 7600gt  ($150 after instant rebate)  ($20 rebate available) $120: radeon x1600xt  $115: geforce 7600gs  ($10 rebate available) $100: radeon x1600pro  ($10 rebate available) $85: geforce 7300gt *recommended*  benchmarks for the above card are at  .
