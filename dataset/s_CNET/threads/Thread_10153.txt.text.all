<s> my buddy has the exact same hdd but it's formatted for mac and my xbox sees his right away. is it my hard drive?  </s>
<s> maybe i formatted it wrong?  </s>
<s> any ideas would be helpful.  </s>
<s> remove all the partitions from it and then create one new fat32 partition and format it fat32.  </s>
<s> it's possible there was some remnant left over from the ntfs system.  </s>
