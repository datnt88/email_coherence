<s> i am wanting to buy a tv tuner card for my bedroom.  </s>
<s> i have an external lcd tv that i watch tv and play my 360 on.  </s>
<s> what i am wondering is which tv tuner cards will allow me to use my monitor for my computer and to hook up the tv tuner card to the tv. the way i would like to do is to have my tv hooked to the tuner card and use my computer as a pvr.  </s>
<s> no one knows of a tv tuner card that i can hook up to an external tv?  </s>
<s> ...but patience is a virtue.  </s>
<s> we're people with lives and things to do, as well as trying to provide assistance to strangers with problems we've never seen before!  </s>
<s> so, you've got an lcd tv that you play console games on, and you want a tv card in your pc that can act as a pvr? that part's easy : any tv card will allow your pc to act like a pvr.  </s>
<s> you can read about many here : the tricky part is where you're asking for a tv card to output to a tv. now let's be a clear here, there are hundreds of tv cards on the market, most have loads of input options for co-ax, s-video, cable etc. but cards which have an output to drive a tv? i haven't seen any of those myself, but they might exist. the reason tv cards do not have outputs by default's sort of obvious. the graphic output of a computer is handled by the graphics card.  </s>
<s> so it's easy to put virtually any tv card into a pc to provide pvr functionality, but you then use a graphics card with a tv output to show the picture on a tv. good luck, geebee.  </s>
