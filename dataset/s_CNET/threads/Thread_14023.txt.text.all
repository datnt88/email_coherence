<s> i'm considering selling some used hard drives.  </s>
<s> i want to make sure the information on those drives can never be recovered.  </s>
<s> besides completely destroying the drive with a power drill, is their a way of erasing the information, that's just as effective?  </s>
<s> i have a program that writes all zeroes to the drive.  </s>
<s> (takes 1 - 5 hours) but is this good enough?  </s>
<s> what is this i hear about programs that write all zeroes, 3, 7, even 35 times?  </s>
<s> when i did volunteer work refurbishing old computers, we used a now unsupported program called autoclave which would write varying patterns on the hard drive a user specified no. of times.  </s>
<s> we always used 3 times which we considered good enough for all except government.  </s>
<s> we also used dban (darick's boot and nuke) which is fairly popular today.  </s>
<s> assuming you don't have something like top secret weapons data, 3 passes is usually enough.  </s>
<s> if you only need protection from ordinary non-government humans without special high tech equipment, 3 passes should be more than adequate.  </s>
<s> ` good luck.  </s>
<s> if the drive is zeroed out, 1 pass, how can it still be recovered?  </s>
<s> could their be residual magnetic information left, that could be reversed?  </s>
<s> of course this would require very expensive equipment that such as identity thieves wouldn't want to buy as the cost/benefit ratio would be small.  </s>
<s> as well, they've too many targets who don't protect themselves well.  </s>
<s> i'd say that, for most purposes, such as dban are more than adequate.  </s>
<s> even one pass from the hd manufacturer's destructive diagnostics utility will make the platters unreadable from within the same drive mechanism.  </s>
<s> why don'y you go for disk sanitization services provided by professionals.  </s>
<s> this service will erase your data completely and will leave no chances of further recovery of data.  </s>
