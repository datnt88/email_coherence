i had been going to ebay for a long time and then one day it just stopped loading. i can go to any other page and i can go to an ebay listing that i have saved in my favorites, but i can't go to ebay.com. i am the only one that uses this computer and i know i didnt block it. what could be going on??
besides the five scans i note in the anti-parasite suite at  the hijackthis log could be posted in a new thread here or over in the security forum for others to dissect if you don't find it. bob
probably has to do with security settings of ur browswer
