i just installed a 2nd hd. is there a way to power it down of shut it off untill i need to access it? 
i am running win xp home and its a western digital 200bb hd thanks 
such is not natively supported, but there are some hard drive switches and drive bay kits that offer such functionality in the $10-$40 range if you shop around online. 
alternatively, just place it in a standard external hdd enclosure, with wide selections available from newegg.com and other stores. 
john 
external usb should not be any problem. 
thanks, i will check into that.
