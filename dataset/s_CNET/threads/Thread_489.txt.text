i have had this printer for 3 years and windows 7 for 1 year. never had a problem with printing from computer until today. a window appears stating that the printer can not communicate with the computer...all of a sudden!!!!! last printed from a file 2 days ago now this. contacted lexmark for 1 1/2 hours today and they could not fix. told me my printer was not compatible with windows 7. why all of a sudden? what can i do??? can not afford a new printer. please be specific!!!...thanks.
did you system restore to the day it worked?
no...how do i do this?
it should show instructions. if that's not enough, head to google.com and ask: how do i use windows 7 system restore? bob
...is many thanks and sorry it took so long to get back to you. will let you know the outcome.
system restore worked loike magic...many thanks
trying to fix it &quot;the right way&quot; by figuring out what went wrong is time consuming and shows a flaw in this system. glad it worked. bob
