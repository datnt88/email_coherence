<s> hi; i just bought skyrim for the pc. i fit all of the essential requirements, and the game will play.  </s>
<s> but for the recommended i need a better video card.  </s>
<s> i have an ati radeon hd 4350.  </s>
<s> apparently that's not enough.  </s>
<s> the game is a pretty laggy (enough for it to be annoying.) here is the requirements it says i need.  </s>
<s> any recommendations on what i should get?  </s>
<s> i have been thinking about upgrading for a while, so i am willing to spend a fair amount.  </s>
<s> nothing outrageous, though.  </s>
<s> i don't do that much gaming.  </s>
<s> here is my pc specs.  </s>
<s> and unless you are ready to install a new big power supply i can only offer the that 5450 can drop in without another change.  </s>
<s> and is cheep at covers this again.  </s>
<s> once you admit that a new psu is needed you pick your card from the usual list at has all the specs on this machine.  </s>
<s> at least it will accept common power supplies and video cards.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you need a video card that's compatible with your motherboard.  </s>
<s> your pics don't tell about that.  </s>
<s> common video slots at the moment are pci-e (x1) and pci-e x16.  </s>
<s> don't buy an x16 card if your motherboard doesn't support it! less than a month ago they published a new video card review on tomshardware.com: this is considered authorative, but it won't harm to look at a few other reviews for the cards that are on your shortlist after studying this.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> what..? the first pic is the same as the second!  </s>
<s> i thought i fixed that before i posted.  </s>
<s> here the requirements: &lt;div&gt;here is the motherboard: &lt;/div&gt; ipibl-lb, if i am reading it correctly.  </s>
<s> from what i have learned, the motherboard does indeed support x16.  </s>
<s> the one to the left of the fan does not look good.  </s>
<s> could be the picture but it's a sign i look for when inspecting machines.  </s>
<s> more at bob  </s>
<s> might be - hopefully - a crappy picture.  </s>
