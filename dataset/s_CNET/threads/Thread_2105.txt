7661	6	303547	2826784	2826730	zstar5000	8/4/08 6:40 pm	1.2178752e12	wait a sec . . .	so there is a way that i can turn my 250gb desktop sata drive into a usb back up drive, with some sort of enclosure? that way i could theoretically transfer my important data from that drive to my laptop, reformat the sata drive, and use it just like an off-the-shelf usb back up drive?
7661	7	303547	2826943	2826784	lacsr	8/5/08 4:15 am	1.2179097e12	sure, you can do it	see here:  pick the one you like and install the old drive in the enclosure. connect the combination to any computer with usb 2.0 ports to get the info off of the old drive and save to the host computer or cd or dvd for later use.
7661	8	303547	2827025	2826784	willy	8/5/08 7:16 am	1.21792056e12	an option...	provided you have no sata hd issues, then using this adapter has allowed access to data. this adapter is far more flexible than a simple usb enclosure, but check it out if it fits yours needs. goto:  look for ada-2020 or google for a picture/example. i've already used in cases like yours and the other way around too, getting laptop hd data. plus, as a quick way to test cd drives as well. tada -----willy
