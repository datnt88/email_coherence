9172	0	350380	3083368	nr	pamlo	7/17/09 11:43 am	1.24783098e12	wireless to wired connection	i have a 2wire dsl modem and last year set up a wireless network for my nearby laptop and my pc downstairs. due to problems since day 1 i'd rather have a wired connection downstairs. i don't care about having a network, sharing files between the two computers, etc. can i just connect my pc to the filtered phone jack downstairs? can the laptop still be wireless upstairs or does that need to be wired too? thanks so much!
