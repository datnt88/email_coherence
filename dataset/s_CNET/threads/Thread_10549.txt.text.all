<s> hi everyone, it is the first time i'm building a computer and i would like to be sure thatt this setup is problem-free and relatively adequate for my use.  </s>
<s> i'm mostly doing heavy photoshop work with some premiere work, and i'm gaming only occasionnally.  </s>

<s> more importantly, is there a serious compatibility problem?  </s>
<s> thank you very much!  </s>
<s> has me checking the dual rail +12v but at 30a each and looking at the power tests i think it's ok.  </s>
<s> i see you going for the somewhat expert os install on ssdd so let's hope you have support handy for that.  </s>

<s> unless your planning on over clocking look at the 3770.......sans &quot;k&quot;.  </s>
<s> thank you for your good responses!  </s>
<s> maybe i'm indeed going to overclock it so it seems the k is fine.  </s>
<s> my concern is more about the gpu, isn't that a little over the board as i don't think i'll be playing a lot of heavy games?  </s>
<s> is the 660 or the hd7870 (or even slightly lower) still acceptable?  </s>
<s> this is where you head over to tom's...do some reading...let your wallet be your guide.  </s>
<s> start with none. the 3770 comes with an igp......test it.  </s>
<s> if that's acceptable to you......good to go.  </s>
<s> if not......move up the gpu ladder.  </s>
