i have a kingston data traveler 4gb. the head snapped off. is there any way to recover the info on there?
shows the usual picture of what's inside. we take that to the bench and solder on another cable or connector for that last time use to get the files out.  also does this if you don't. bob
i do not have the equipment but i will take it to a location that does. thanks for the info.
i called drivesavers and they quoted $500-$1200 to repair. seems really high.
they go beyond the simple repair i noted. they can even remove the flash memory chip and put it on another board. then if there is file system damage they can recover that too. when you can't lose it, they are to go to people. the highest price we paid was about 24,000 for recovering novell drives. long story about an it that believed that raid meant that backup was not necessary since raid could recover from drive loss. backup copies are always cheaper. bob
