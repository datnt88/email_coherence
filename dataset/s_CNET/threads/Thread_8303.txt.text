hi! i have troubles about establishing internet connection in linux because the system doesn't recognise my modem. so i'm searching for a cnet softv92 data fax modem linux driver but i cannot find it anywhere. can anyone help me? :/
they require windows as the operating system to perform the modem functions that a full processor modem's on board processor does. that is why they are so inexpensive. the full processor modems usually cost more than $50, the usr is about $68 at newegg.
while we're a friendly bunch, you may have thought cnet had something to do with your modem. bob
