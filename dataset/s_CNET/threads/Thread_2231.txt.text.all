<s> 1680 x 1050 is the best setting for this monitor and what i use.  </s>
<s> wrong question!!! the correct question is: what is the native resolution of your display to have the expected picture quality?  </s>
<s> it is recommendable to use always the native resulution of the display instead of an induvidual setting.  </s>
<s> before you purchase a display you have the chance to select the preferable resolution and screen size based on the performance of your video card.  </s>

<s> there are lots of variables: 1) size of screen 2) quality of monitor/screen 3) quality and capability of video card 4) personal preference, depending on one's eyes.  </s>
<s> usually, the higher the screen resolution is, the better the image is.  </s>
<s> so, the maximun resolution offered by the monitor should be used. the monitor's aspect ratio is important here.  </s>
<s> for gaming and watching hd movies, an aspect ratio of 16:9 is prefered.  </s>
<s> for general pc usage, a 8:5 (16:10) aspect ratio is better. the resolution used for gaming also depends on the power of the gpu.  </s>
<s> putting all these into consideration, a 24 inch monitor with an aspect ratio of 8:5 used at a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a good choice for general usage, gaming and watching hd movies..  </s>

<s> for those who intentionally set the resolution lower than the native resolution so that they can see text and icons better, windows does allow you to increase the text and icon sizes without lowering the resolution, giving you the best of both worlds.  </s>
