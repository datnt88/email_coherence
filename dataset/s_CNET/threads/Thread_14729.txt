15324	5	171523	1895580	1895398	willy	4/24/06 10:30 am	1.1458746e12	looks like video problem	verify any video card is cooling well. see, if the fan(is there) is working 100% and cleaned of any dust build-up, etc.. reseat the video card as well. plus, if the problem persists, then get your hands on any other video card to test it even if a low-level one just to get beyond what maybe a video ram or heat problem of the video. you can place a household fan to blow on the video card and see what the result are. if it is a video problem then only replacing the card will do. if ytou have oc'ed the video then slow it down abit fby its direct s/w or use the bios or both areas. it certainly appears a video problem. either bad ram or weak video chipset. there's the outside chance apossible video driver update may help if driver related. again, simple video card replacement can test all this. tada -----willy

15324	7	171523	1896384	1896007	tien-avenger	4/24/06 5:20 pm	1.1458992e12	just swap cards already	all that data you've just listed is pretty much worthless. you've displayed the temps of everything but your video card and the voltages arent labled so who knows what is taking up how much power. you said it yourself your card is atleast 3 years old so your power supply isnt the problem 485w is more then enough 3 years ago, you've updated every bios and video card driver and almost everyone who posted a reply narrowed the problem down to your video card and swapping out the video card. you've already came to a conclusion that it's not a software problem with all the updateing you've done. now start swapin to see if it's a hardware problem.

15324	10	171523	1899227	1899142	willy	4/25/06 8:30 pm	1.145997e12	look at	you maybe pushing too far with the tv link and computer as these are separate ckts. up to a point. when both are running or not as one can't be truly turn-off just unused, the heat build-up is alot(alot). further, as video temp reading, the sensor isn't available if not plugged-in to the mtrbd. as a sensor as most video fans use a 2-wire setup, 3-wire is requied to relay the info. what worries me is seeing the the one fan sensor showing under 3000rpm isn't that good for a 54deg. reading, it should be faster, imho. but the temp reading is ok or typical for basic fan. video cards get pretty warm, but hot isn't good. check away and come back with results. tada -----willy

(reassemble link to view)  _w0qqitemz8800177740qqcategoryz40158qqsspagenamezwdvwqq rdz1qqcmdzviewitem i have liked this card for 3 years and this auction said it was never really used. i know it is a risk but i took the chance so i will be hopefully back to where i was before when the new old card arrives. again, i'd love to hear an explantion of how these problems could manifest themselves in the way that they have. and i would like to thank all responders for the guidance i have received. brett

15324	14	171523	1923443	1907753	willy	5/8/06 9:37 am	1.14708102e12	see that one way or another	heat is the most common &quot;wear&tear&quot; effect on eletronic componets. the other is mismatched voltages and/or beyond tolerances. heat is *always* doing damage buut if with specs the effects only come after long usage or if beyond tolerances for prolonged times, begin more immediately. i exclude any marginal componet which do come down the pike during manufacture. heat alone can overtime cause a problem. the ffects are the lag time of display of reduced ram management unable to keep-up. further, some driver s/w has caused similar problems and only a driver update corrects this if at all, as physical systems vary. all-in-all, things work well but if pushed easily are toppled. ask any gamer what seems to be a problem and most decry this or that, but the real cause is they're pushing thier systems to the limit and further don't want to relish anything to decrease gameply. usually only better compoents(equipment) or faster this or that does well and that means &quot;top-shelf&quot; items, pricey. hope you get to read this, adios -----willy
