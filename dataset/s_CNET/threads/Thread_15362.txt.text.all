i just purchased a new netgear rangemax wireless router wnr834b now i can't get my d-link dsc 2100+ to connect. 
when i search for the camera nothing shows up. 
any ideas???? 
you need to setup the camera again. 
hardwired it and nothing shows up 
last time it also involved it's reset button, 20 seconds and reading the manual again. 
it's getting better i have the camera working hardwired but i can't get it to work wireless 
i had to use wpa, ssid broadcasting, dhcp in the camera, etc. i can't tell what setup you are trying.
