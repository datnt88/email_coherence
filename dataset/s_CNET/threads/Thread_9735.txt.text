specs a7n8x-e motherboard 512mb cmx3200 corsair ram geforce4 ti 4200 amd athlon 2600+ windows 2000 pro i hope someone might be able to help me with this. about 4 days ago my computer froze twice, the third time i restarted it would not go pass the post screen, the one that shows a7n8x-e deluxe screen. i decided to clean out my computer with compressed air i had. i removed most components to clean them. after putting them back and turning up my computer now i couldn't see the screen or anything and there was no beep. i'm not sure if i damaged something or something else is to blame. i resetted my cmos and still wasn't able to see anything on screen, the fan from my video card doesnt spin but works fine in this current computer. i don't know what else to try or to have one of the parts be replaced. please if anyone can help me with this problem.
sorry i did not see the computer help thread until now if you still think you're able to help me please post here.
u didnt mention if there was a beep after clearing ur cmos but if u cant post and the fan on your video card isnt working it sounds as though maybe you should try a known good used video card to see if this fixes your problem. the chipset on ur video card requires the fan otherwise the manufacturer would not have installed it. hope this is of some use.
there was no beep after clearing the cmos. my video card works good in this computer, fan spins everything in the computer that has the problem it doesn't work at all. there's no beep, no screen no boot.
