which screen resolution do you prefer? 800x600 pixels(on what size monitor?) 1,024x768 pixels (on what size monitor?) 1,152x864 pixels (on what size monitor?) 1,280x768 pixels (on what size monitor?) 1,280x1,024 pixels (on what size monitor?) 1,600x1,200 pixels (on what size monitor?) 1,920x1,200 pixels (on what size monitor?) 1,900x1,440 pixels (on what size monitor?) 2,048x1,536 pixels or higher (can you even read this?) other (what is it?)
1920x1080 on a 19 inch laptop.
i am surprised 1680x1050 not in original list. i thought it was a common size.
32 bit monitor, 1028 x 768.
1440 x 900 was recommended on my 19&quot; widescreen
i use 1900x440, only b/c it's the max size my 19&quot; monitor allows.
1680 x 1050 on 22&quot;
i guess that reasoning of 'doesn't really matter' comes from me not always having the most up to date equipment. basically, as long as i can see what's on the screen and it works adequately, i'll shut up and take whatever resolution that it offers.
on my 23&quot; widescreen, the native resolution is 1920x1080. it works well. picture quality is excellent!
1600 x 900, the highest my linux mint x64 will allow, using a 21.5&quot; (i'm pretty sure) screen.
1680x1050, which the screen resolutionbox says is recommended.

1680 x 1050 is the best setting for this monitor and what i use.
wrong question!!! the correct question is: what is the native resolution of your display to have the expected picture quality? it is recommendable to use always the native resulution of the display instead of an induvidual setting. before you purchase a display you have the chance to select the preferable resolution and screen size based on the performance of your video card. also here you will find out soon that the variety will be limited.
1,024x768 pixels dell 2407 it is the best configuration for size of icons and text for my eyesight, and to get the most icons on the desktop without it seeming to get cluttered.
1,920x1,080 (on 27inch imac monitor) for normal use and hd movies. 2,560x1,440 which is the full res on this machine's monitor for photography work.
surely the resolution you use is determined by the particular task being performed at any given time as most monitors have several suitable resolutions available.
i use wqxga, that is 2560x1600 on 30&quot; dell monitor. such displays are expensive but the compfort of work is extreme, especially if you are a professional designer, programmer or you worh with many open windows. i'm really unhappy if i'm forced to work on a smaller display or lower resolution.

there are lots of variables: 1) size of screen 2) quality of monitor/screen 3) quality and capability of video card 4) personal preference, depending on one's eyes.
usually, the higher the screen resolution is, the better the image is. so, the maximun resolution offered by the monitor should be used. the monitor's aspect ratio is important here. for gaming and watching hd movies, an aspect ratio of 16:9 is prefered. for general pc usage, a 8:5 (16:10) aspect ratio is better. the resolution used for gaming also depends on the power of the gpu. putting all these into consideration, a 24 inch monitor with an aspect ratio of 8:5 used at a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a good choice for general usage, gaming and watching hd movies..
i am a 70 year old man and i use 1024x768 22 in. asus moniter as it gives me the best size on the desktop and other print.
1400x900 17&quot;dtv
i use 1920 x 1080 on a acer 22&quot; wide it gives the best resolution for most all around general use and video watching with little or no pixelating in full screen view
i have 1680x1050 on my 15&quot; laptop. i find it to be a good compromise in size. i don't want too high a resolution because i'm afraid everything will be too small and lower resolution means i can't fit as much on the screen. unfortunately newer laptops don't seem to offer this resolution anymore.
i agree with jsmith29, 1920 x 1080 is ideal. used to be the hd highest res. for tv's, but now a days a lot of pc monitors use this (16:9) res too. great for games and native for blu ray.
p.s. it goes without saying, that you will want to run anything (desktop,games, etc) at your screens native res, as long as your gpu is up to it!
1920x 1080 on the lg 22.5&quot; and 1280x1024 on acer 19&quot; great on the lg, but it blooms on the 19 inch to where i loose some of the sides. i guess because one is wide format the other is not?
cnet also failed to include wide-screen choices. i use 1280x720 from 12 feet away on my 40-inch lcd and switch to 1920x1080 from 4 feet away while doing detailed photo work. cyanoramphus: your set-up is crazy! manahatta: not true for crts. jsmith29 still has one. liamsisk: there are only a few games left that hijack your settings. they must in order to perform. otherwise, you are the master of your screen resolution. i see that you backed down in your second answer. kilhan: over-compensating? i should talk! sweetgirish: we don't all max it out. dayman got it right.
i'm using a viewsonic 17 inch crt monitor with 1280*1024 resolution.
asus 26 inch - 1920 x 1200 like it very much can't wait to get another 1 or 2
i use 1440 by 900 to take advantage of the widescreen 23 ich monitor i have on the unit. this gives me the ability of having multiple web pages open an one time.
those are the numbers i have also. i found out the monitor resolution needs to be a give and take for my eye-sight and also for having the room on screen to work around in photo editing. 1440x 900 seems to work for me.
i don't recall ever seeing such varied replies to a cnet poll. i conclude: resolution is in the eye of the beholder.

2560 x 1600 on mac 30 inch cinema hd screen. fonts of all sizes are easily readable. i use an nvidia fx3700 graphics card. to me there is no better viewing than a large screen (mine is now 5 years old and still fine) for design & general work or game play. i am also using 4 250 gb barracuda drives in an f5 raid array for extra speed and data security.

every monitor i have had has complained about this setting, my current one is 21&quot;, previous 19&quot;. i am visually impaired and this is one i need to be able to see it. stupid manufacuers jsut don't care about the disabled.
i also use 1440x900 on my acer 19 inch flat panel. considering that's its native resolution, i don't have much choice.
1680x1050 and 1920x1080 dual monitors are a minimum setup and surprisingly they don't really need to match resolutions.. although too wide a spread can be annoying. 1 question that comes to mind when looking at your listing of resolutions is who decides what the number are??

indeed, but when it comes to monitors the best resolution will always be the one native to your display (in my case 1920x1080). there are some exceptions such as system resource heavy games. if you don't have a powerful enough setup (modern gpu, atleast 4gb memory etc.) the game will perform much better if you lower the res., while keeping the same aspect ratio. other than that, always set to native resolution.
1920 x 1080 on a samsung 2333hd, 23&quot;. it's in my kitchen and also makes a great space-saving tv with a minimum of extra wiring, boxes, etc. it was also one of the few that just barely fit under my kitchen cabinets. very happy with it, although, the built-in speakers are barely adequate. i suspect that most of the &quot;other&quot; votes were also 1920 x 1080, as this seems to be the most common offering these days. you can get a 22 to 24 incher sometimes less than $150. i couldn't even find a 1280 x 1024 to replace my old 19&quot; when it died. for those who intentionally set the resolution lower than the native resolution so that they can see text and icons better, windows does allow you to increase the text and icon sizes without lowering the resolution, giving you the best of both worlds. it doesn't always yield ideal results, but is worth trying.

1680x1050 is the default on all 50+ 22&quot; monitors i use at work and all 3 i have at my house. it's a lot more common than some odd size like 1152x864, that's for sure!
1920 x 1080 on my 21.5&quot; dell monitor. wasn't hd the reason they made this size? i think it's smart, with the convergence of tv and pc, to give them the same resolution.
i have mine set at 1440x900 for my 23' samsung which is the best for my 72 year old eyes. i play fsx and have that set for 1920x1080x32 which is the best for that program.
