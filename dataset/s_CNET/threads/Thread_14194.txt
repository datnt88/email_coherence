6992	3	409237	3371713	3371682	r. proffitt	9/8/10 3:00 pm	1.283958e12	you may be dismayed.	but wpa is still tough to crack. and you can mix and match the advice to see which item it is that is causing an issue. it could be the old hidden ssid issue but you didn't write that. once in a while i encounter a client that won't try something because &quot;what i have now should work.&quot; then i know that they will have to buy a new router. bob

6992	7	409237	3372345	3372313	maxxyvan	9/9/10 3:10 pm	1.284045e12	update	in checking the router's settings, there are three settings for the wireless mode switch; n only, g only, or n+g+b. it was set on n+g+b. seems like the correct setting would be n+g+b if you wanted to accommodate all users.
6992	8	409237	3372504	3372345	r. proffitt	9/9/10 8:07 pm	1.28406282e12	you would think that.	but my printer would not play with my first n router on that setting. i had to set the router to g mode. since there was no firmware update i returned that model and the next model is fine. i've encountered folk that get stuck on &quot;this should work&quot; rather than experiment to see what works. bob
