1255	6	380608	3238268	3236127	heck	2/2/10 5:00 pm	1.26513e12	still not working	i installed the chipset drivers, quickset, and several other drivers, and i'm still having the same problem. the computer says that no wireless adapter has been installed. when i install the wireless driver, it begins to detect it, but then the computer crashes. is it possible that the wireless adapter was damaged somehow?
