troughout the past week my computer kept freezing every once in a while when playing world of warcraft. i would have to restart my computer after the picture froze. just today i was playing when suddenly the computer just turned off. i went to turn it on again and it will not power up. no lights, no fans, nothing. i figured maybe the power supply was dead, which would have explained the strange freezes i was getting throughout the week. i switched power supplies with an older computer and found the same results. the power supply that i thought was dead was working fine on the older computer, and my newer computer still had nothing. i tried switching the graphics cards with the same results, the graphics card works fine on the other computer. i don't think its the memory because the computer isnt even starting up. seems like its a power problem, yet the power supply appears to be working fine on other computers. could my motherboard have died out on me? i'm using an asus p5b-e motherboard and have had it for 6 months before these problems started. cpu is a core 2 duo 2.4ghz. anyone have any ideas on how i should go about troubleshooting this? any help would be great. thanks!
have you checked to see if the cpu fan is working, could be that the cpu over-heated and shut down, the same could also be true of the memory? chris
don't discount the ram.in spite of what you said, the same happened to my computer-just stopped working, would not power up etc.after trying everything, including numerous e-mails and help from hp,i eventually removed one of the ram modules, and hey presto it worked!!
