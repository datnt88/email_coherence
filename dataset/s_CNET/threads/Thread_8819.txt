6164	4	291678	2753067	2752980	willy	4/16/08 5:12 pm	1.20836592e12	seek that link	i can only *assume* you're talking about a &quot;overdrive kit&quot; type of thing. i don't recall such an item, it's probably cheaper(maybe) to get a new mtrbd. that truly supports dual-core cpu and go from there. that way, you'll have a greater range of upgrades as its needed. if you can provide that amazon link, review it again and match it against your current system specs. otherwise, its a dead-end for dual path, only a single core will do. using the link i provided in the last, find the upgrade link and post a question to emachine support and see what they may suggest. heck, it doesn't hurt to ask. tada -----willy
