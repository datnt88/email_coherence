some of them like lenovo or gateway only allow for 2gigs of ram. looking into the future, 2 gigs doesn't seem as if it's going to have a lot of staying power. i need opinions as to whether or not a 2 gig maximum is going to be sufficient say 9 mo. to a year from now. i'd like a computer that will not become obsolete all to quickly. thanks in advance.
very few home machines get such upgrades and vista that came with that box is all of 32 bit so that means crazy things like ram may only register 3 to 3.5 gb even with 4gb installed. sorry, it's not a big deal for how long such a machine lasts. bob
if you have vista and put a higher-end video card in your system 3gb of ram may be useful. vista handles ram differently. for example, you upgrade to a 256mb dedicated ram video card. vista will use up to 1023mb of total system ram for graphics(including the card's 256mb). so the rest of your system will have up to 768mb less ram for other things excluding graphics. with ddr2 prices dropping why not? i put in an extra gb for like $50.00
now put your 50 bucks into your video card...
