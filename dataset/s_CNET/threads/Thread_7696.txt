9080	3	238147	2431345	2429039	ramarc	3/15/07 12:21 pm	1.17396126e12	re: hp media center pcs	the m7690n has a faster cpu (e6400 2.13ghz vs e6300 1.86 ghz), 1gb more ram, 500gb hard drive (vs. 250gb), hd dvd drive (m7659 does not), and geforce 7600gt graphics (vs. 7500le). so, the m7690n is certainly worth a $300 price premium. neither will display hd tv channels because neither has an hd tuner card. you could add a hd tuner but you'd have to either dump the modem card (no free pci slots) or go with an external usb tuner (my suggestion is the hauppauge wintv-hvr-950 for $110). the m7690n comes with the necessary software to play hd dvds (hp dvd play hd-dvd 2.2). as for an hdcp capable monitor, the acer al2216wbd is a 22&quot; widescreen for about $320; the sceptre x20wc is a 20&quot; widescreen and is about $220. m7659n specs:  m7690n specs:  wintv-hvr-950:  sceptre x20wc:  acer al2216wbd:

9080	7	238147	2439496	2429039	nicomp42	3/23/07 4:50 pm	1.1746686e12	my 2 cents	this is just my opinion and i don't want to disparage anyone else who took the time to post. i'm self-employed as a computer geek and i sell a lot of hardware to families, home businesses, and small businesses, so that's where i'm coming from. my opinion is that if you stick with the name brands and do your homework you'll be fine. you've obviously studied the dvd issue and you know that there is some variation there. beyond that, set a budget for yourself and stick with it. companies like dell will kill you with little add-ons and upgrades when you try to finalize your purchase. ask the vendor about the warranty: where will it be fixed? if it's a depot warranty and the depot is 1000 miles away, then you will be without your machine for quite a while. also be sure that you understand the warranty. most warranties cover only what it takes to put the machine back to the way it was when you purchased it. that makes sense because it would be problematic for them to try to reinstall everything you added when you got it home. even though it makes sense, it's still maddening to the purchaser because it could end up costing them more $ above and beyond the warranty coverage. i strongly endorse a quality monitor as part of the purchase. you're going to be staring at it for a long time. don't beat yourself up over the price difference between 17&quot; and 19&quot;. get the 19&quot; and enjoy it. you can't upgrade a monitor once you've purchased it. try to arrange the ram such that there's room for upgrade without having to pitch what's already in there. for example, if you elect to get 1gb, then buy a 1gb stick and leave the other slot empty. don't get 2 512mb sticks because you'll have to toss one in in order to install a new one. an extra bay in the chassis for another hard drive is a nice thing to have. if you add a drive, then you don't have to move everything off your original drive. if you don't have room for a 2nd drive, you can always hook up an external usb drive and use that as a 2nd drive. resign yourself that the system will seem outdated in 6 months. it's ok. get something to back up with. if you choose to back up on dvds, then do it regularly. i assume that you'll probably store your photos on your hard drive. imagine what your life would be like if those photos suddenly vanished. feed on that fear and use it to backup regularly. get your o/s on disk. don't depend on that 'secret' partition to be there when you need to restore. vendors try to save a buck by hiding the installation image on your hard drive, which might work ok sometimes, but if the drive is unavailable, so is the installation partition.
9080	8	238147	2439547	2439496	coffeecan	3/23/07 5:53 pm	1.17467238e12	you're right about the secret partition and o/s disk!	i have an hp thats 8 months old and lost my restore disk( that i originally had to make) in a catastrophic weather event. i had to reformat recently due to virus. lost the &quot;secret partition doing that. cannot get a replacement and restore disk from hp. computer still in warranty. they will not help me. have previously had very good service from hp but this time they will not help. on line ordering says disk not available. why is this and the box is only 8 months old!!! i am so upset that i purposely went out and searched for a new computer with an o/s disk. 1-800/888 tech support people tell me that they can't order the disk for me because they are out of it. online ordering says they are out of it. the great sales dept says to contact the 1-800/888 support folks. the complaint dept says the same. so i went out and bought a toshiba laptop with an o/s disk and other restoration disk furnished with the computer. screw hp!. they are as bad as lexar products.
