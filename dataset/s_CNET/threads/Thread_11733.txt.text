when i restart my computer, my color setting is 16 bit. i change it to 32 and it works fine until i restart when it promptly resets. any help would be great.
given what information is in your post, i just want to ask if you feel that this can be solved. bob
i just noticed that this is the desktop forum, oops (my computer is a notebook) but i doubt this problem is limited to notebooks. i really have no idea what is going on, and haven't tinkered around too much yet, but i was just posting to see if anyone else had had the same problem. i think it is probably a setting in another program., but like i said, haven't given much time to it yet.
you can always try supplying make/model number and what video driver you are using.
well, i don't know if it was the problem, but i noticed that when i changed the color depth, my winamp skin also changed, so i have changed the skin and now all seems to be working fine. thanks all.
