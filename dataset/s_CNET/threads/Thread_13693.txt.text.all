<s> i'm looking at doing a complete upgrade to my current computer (first upgrade to my pc in almost 4 years).  </s>
<s> i'm not really interested in upgrading my motherboard to one that has a pci-x16 video card slot, as i'd rather just keep the agp supported one i currently have to save money.  </s>
<s> i'm just trying to get the best parts i possibly can for an agp based pc. i'm hoping to keep my current power supply, hard drives, and motherboard, and just get a new video card, processor, and memory.  </s>
<s> i don't really have much of a budget, but want to stay around the $400 area.  </s>
<s> here are my current specs: operating system: windows xp home edition (5.1, build 2600) service pack 2 (2600.xpsp_sp2_gdr.080814-1233) motherboard: gigabyte 7vt600-rz (-c) processor: amd athlon(tm) , mmx, 3dnow, ~1.1ghz memory: 1024mb ram power supply: turbocase aspire 500w dual fan aluminum power supply (atx-as500w 12v) video card: ati 128 rage first i want to make sure that i get the absolute best agp nvidia video card i can, the reason i'm wanting to stick with nvidia is because the last nvidia i had worked pretty well and i really enjoyed the easy navigation for the s-video with duel monitors.  </s>
<s> after looking around, it seems as if the best agp one that nvidia makes is the nvidia 512mb 7950gt which only costs around $80-$100 on ebay, which is a pretty good price.  </s>
<s> so would the best agp video card be better than a mediocre pci-x16 card?  </s>
<s> would the best agp video card for $100 be as good as a pci-x16 video card for also $100? because i'm looking to spend around a maximum of $100-$150 for a video card, so for that price, if i'd get an overall better video card with an agp than i would a pci-x16, i'd definitely stick with just getting another agp card, and save myself the $100-$200 on getting a whole new motherboard.  </s>
<s> i don't really upgrade my system that often, as i don't use it for gaming much, and just use it for video editing, so me &quot;having to get a pci-x16 just to stay up to date with the current models&quot; wouldn't really be important to me since i only upgrade my parts every so often.  </s>
<s> as for a processor, my current motherboard supports the following processors: it looks like the amd athlon 3200 socket a 400mhz would be the best choice out of the list, can anyone confirm this?  </s>
<s> i'm hoping to get a processor that is pretty damn fast, as the one i currently have is absolutely horrible.  </s>
<s> it says the 3200 runs off 2.4ghz, is that good?  </s>
<s> my current is only 1.1ghz, so it seems like this one would be much faster.  </s>
<s> as for memory, i definitely want as much as my motherboard can handle.  </s>
<s> it supports ddr400 memory, so how would 3gb of ddr400 memory sound?  </s>
<s> any help would be great, thanks.  </s>
<s> for under your 400 buck budget we can see machines like you'll get your new machine, windows 7 upgrade and more performance than the old iron.  </s>
<s> i recently had to make this same choice.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> damn, that seems like a pretty nice pc. i was hesitant at first when i noticed you were recommending that i just buy a full pc (rather than replacing my current custom), but that seems like a pretty good deal to me.  </s>
