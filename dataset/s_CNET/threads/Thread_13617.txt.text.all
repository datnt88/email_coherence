while playing the old republic my i5 2500k temperature peaks at about 50c. 
i was wondering if this is too hot. 
what is the processor rated for? 
any feedback would be great! 
thanks! 
windows 7 64bit i5 2500k gtx 570 16 gig ram 
i looked at the intel.com 
site and that's ok. i see some max temp of 75c there.
