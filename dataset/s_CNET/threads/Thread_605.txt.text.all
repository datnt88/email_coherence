<s> hello, i am planning a new itx-build computer and i'm a bit unsure as to a video card.  </s>
<s> ideally, i would like to find a card that could sound as well as video through the hdmi port.  </s>
<s> would most video cards with an hdmi port be capable of sound output, or would i need to look for a special feature on the card?  </s>
<s> (also, i have no real plans on gaming on it. the most graphically demanding operation is probably just playing blu-ray on it.  </s>
<s> if i can find a slim blu-ray drive.) here is the case and motherboard i am planning on purchasing in case this has any affect on a recommendation.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> this means you're going with some sandybridge cpu which will have on board graphics that should be capable enough for everyday use.  </s>
<s> have you selected the exact processor you want and checked to see which intel graphics offering it has?  </s>
<s> i might suggest something in the i5 range due to possible heat considerations and you don't need the unlocked versions.  </s>
<s> you might want to put the box together and see how well it does before adding a discrete video card.  </s>
<s> intel's sandy bridge graphics are (finally) respectable.  </s>
<s> unless you want to do some gaming, the integrated graphics are perfect for in an itx form factor.  </s>
<s> i was thinking of getting the i7-2600 (non k version).  </s>
<s> if i were to go the discrete card route, would any potential card with an hdmi port fit the bill of being able to output sound as well?  </s>

<s> if you have an answer to offer or need clarification of the original question, please reply to the original post at the beginning of this thread.  </s>
<s> you may want to create a new &quot;discussion&quot; since this question format happens replies when you ask a question later in a reply.  </s>
<s> go figure.  </s>
