i want to buy a desktop pc - now i am in dilema what should be the best desktop pc - whether amd 3600+ duel core or intel duel core 2.8 or 3ghz. 
if any computer hardware experts explain that will be benefit people like us. 
1. ford vs. chevy. the car analogy works well here. 
2. &quot;best&quot;? 
given any week, one cpu in some system vs the other maker will have the best scores on some benchmark. 
this changes weekly or monthly so anyone trying to pick the winner will be sorely confused until they discover that today's offerings have never offered more speed and value for the dollar.

athlon 64 x2 &gt; pentium d the amd will run cooler, faster, and use less power. 
especially if those pentium d's are from the 800 series (805, 820, 830, 840).
