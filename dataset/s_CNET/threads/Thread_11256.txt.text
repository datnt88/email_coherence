ssia, i'm in the process of getting a desk, a docking station for my laptop, and wireless keyboard and mouse. and either a big monitor or a like 32&quot; tv (all for my bedroom). i'll be using it as my tv basically, i don't have cable. i'm new here, and input will be appreciated! john
i see you are looking at wireless but something still gets wired to the laptop. bob
i have the harmon kardon soundsticks and i find the sound really good, but, as you can see from the photos, the subwoofer has a blue light glowing when it's powered. if it's for your bedroom, one of the others would be better if they don't have lights on them (if you leave them powered all the time and if glowing lights will bother your sleep). that's the only drawback to them, otherwise i'd recommend them.
