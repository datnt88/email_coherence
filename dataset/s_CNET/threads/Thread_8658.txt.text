hello everyone, i'm in the process of configuring my first custom build. this system will be used for 3d graphics. i hope to configure a system that will be able to be upgraded with newer parts as prices fall in the future. i can't justify spending more than $1100. can you computer gurus out there have a quick look and let me know if i am mismatching. or, if you have any suggestions, i am more than happy and greatful to know what you think. thanks allot guys! motherboard and cpu  memory  graphics card  hard drive  optical drive  os  power supply unit  case
gpu. you might want to look at the hd 7870. seems to be a little more &quot;bang for the buck&quot;
i'm really interested in cuda tech but not completely married to it. the only other thing that gives me trepidation on the 7870 are the user comments about it not being recognized by the mobo. this is my first build so i am kind of nervous about the assembly stage.
