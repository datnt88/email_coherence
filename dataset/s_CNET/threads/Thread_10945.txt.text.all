<s> if you are booting from the sata, set the boot order to represent that drive first.  </s>
<s> attach the ide drive to an available port (single or cs will do), and xp should assign a drive letter.  </s>
<s> i tried that a while back and it no longer could see my operating system on the serial ata drive and would not boot.  </s>
<s> i will try it again.  </s>
<s> when you say &quot;(single or cs will do)&quot; i set mine to slave is that ok?  </s>
<s> where the os is stored.  </s>
<s> all other interfaces (ide, usb, network) can follow.  </s>
<s> a lone drive on an ide channel should be set as suggested.  </s>
<s> i must not have set up the sata right as now when i hook a ide up to use as a slave the computer will not boot.  </s>
<s> when i look in the bios it says the sata is the 4th primary am i missing somthing? the jumpers on the hard drive are set to use it as a slave  </s>
<s> do not use master/slave configurations.  </s>
<s> only one drive per channel.  </s>
<s> move your sata up to the first boot position.  </s>
<s> in most default scenarios, your system bios will look for an ide device first, this needs to be changed.  </s>
