i have a asus p4p800-se motherboard and serial ata hard drive. 
how would i hook up an extra ide drive up to the motherboard to use it as a slave and or to transfer the files off of it.

if you are booting from the sata, set the boot order to represent that drive first. 
attach the ide drive to an available port (single or cs will do), and xp should assign a drive letter. 
i tried that a while back and it no longer could see my operating system on the serial ata drive and would not boot. 
i will try it again. 
when you say &quot;(single or cs will do)&quot; i set mine to slave is that ok? 
where the os is stored. 
all other interfaces (ide, usb, network) can follow. 
a lone drive on an ide channel should be set as suggested. 
i must not have set up the sata right as now when i hook a ide up to use as a slave the computer will not boot. 
when i look in the bios it says the sata is the 4th primary am i missing somthing? the jumpers on the hard drive are set to use it as a slave 
do not use master/slave configurations. 
only one drive per channel. 
move your sata up to the first boot position. 
in most default scenarios, your system bios will look for an ide device first, this needs to be changed.
