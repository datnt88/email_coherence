once i could copy direct to my lg cd/dvd f drive. for some unknown reason i can no longer find the facility in send to ... how can i get it back please? i am using xp pro
the software that came with the cdrw may need to be uninstalled, installed and updated. did you try that? in closing, i don't see any indication in your post of a hardware issue. can you tell what hardware issue you suspect? bob
after some sp2 install? there may be some probs there. don't know about xp but my w98 has a &quot;send to&quot; folder inside windows. i lost my send to &quot;floppy&quot; and just dragged a shortcut back into the folder.
