<s> i am wondering if someone can &quot;sell&quot; me on a wireless networking system or if i should just stick with good old ethernet cables.  </s>
<s> i am only hooking 2 computers to a dsl modem. the modem is between the 2, and the distance between the 2 computers is only about 25 ft.  </s>
<s> seems the wireless router and 2 wireless cards i would need cost way more than simply purchasing a wired router and two 25' cords. is there any real need for me to go wireless with this setup??? thanks for any help.  </s>
<s> l.t.  </s>
<s> no need for the extra expense of a wireless nic.  </s>
<s> a wired nic is less than twenty bucks, wireless around fifty.  </s>
<s> wireless is good for laptops, or in instances where wiring would be a pita.  </s>
<s> i have three pcs wired to my router, and the laptop travels around the house using wireless.  </s>
<s> most consumer oriented routers on the market combine wired/wireless features.  </s>
<s> the added wireless function is nice to have if your want to add a roaming laptop and since it comes already there it's a no-brainer.  </s>
<s> hi in all cases there is one golden rule: if it can be done with cables, then do it with cables; no interference,no leaks, no nothing  </s>
<s> thanks for all of the input.  </s>
<s> i think i will just go with cables and put the $100 i save toward a really good printer/all-in-one.  </s>
<s> i appreciate the feedback.  </s>
<s> have a nice weekend, everyone!  </s>

<s> very wise!there was an excellent bbc prog: on this very subject of wireless pcs! they had a couple of guys cruising a housing estate in a car, and it seems they could pick up every wirless connection on a laptop.  </s>
<s> most were not secure, and even those that were could be hacked!  </s>
<s> glad i watched it as i was about to go over to wireless, not anymore, im sticking to wired connections.  </s>
<s> have a nice one.  </s>
<s> ps. sorry about capitals, i have an optical disadvantage.  </s>
<s> this is a very old thread.  </s>
<s> locked.  </s>
