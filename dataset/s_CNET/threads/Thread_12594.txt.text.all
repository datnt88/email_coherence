i am wondering if someone can &quot;sell&quot; me on a wireless networking system or if i should just stick with good old ethernet cables. 
i am only hooking 2 computers to a dsl modem. the modem is between the 2, and the distance between the 2 computers is only about 25 ft. 
seems the wireless router and 2 wireless cards i would need cost way more than simply purchasing a wired router and two 25' cords. is there any real need for me to go wireless with this setup??? thanks for any help.

no need for the extra expense of a wireless nic. 
a wired nic is less than twenty bucks, wireless around fifty. 
wireless is good for laptops, or in instances where wiring would be a pita. 
i have three pcs wired to my router, and the laptop travels around the house using wireless. 
most consumer oriented routers on the market combine wired/wireless features. 
the added wireless function is nice to have if your want to add a roaming laptop and since it comes already there it's a no-brainer. 
hi in all cases there is one golden rule: if it can be done with cables, then do it with cables; no interference,no leaks, no nothing 
thanks for all of the input. 
i think i will just go with cables and put the $100 i save toward a really good printer/all-in-one. 
i appreciate the feedback. 
have a nice weekend, everyone!

very wise!there was an excellent bbc prog: on this very subject of wireless pcs! they had a couple of guys cruising a housing estate in a car, and it seems they could pick up every wirless connection on a laptop. 
most were not secure, and even those that were could be hacked! 
glad i watched it as i was about to go over to wireless, not anymore, im sticking to wired connections. 
have a nice one. 
ps. sorry about capitals, i have an optical disadvantage. 
this is a very old thread. 
locked.
