graphics card:  [...] p?gpid=280 i want to find out if i can connect the computer to an (old) tv via the graphics card's dvi i port. does the the dvi port support: a) component b) dvi-i rgb? if yes to a) and/or b): the tv is old, 10 years or more. it has 2 scart ports. how do i determine whether the scart ports support a) component b) dvi-i rgb? thanks.
i remember scart has a max resolution of 576i so there is so little gain that i'll just write don't bother. bob
i don't understand your answer. so little gain, compared to what? i don't want to know whether the tv can be a replacement for a computer monitor. from an older computer that had tv out, i know that the reso- lution supported, is to low for that purpose. but for watching movies and videos is was sufficient (800x600). and that is my question, can i use the dvi port to connect to the tv scart port, and by that obtain the above purpose. still thanks for your effort.
let's find a dvi to scart cable. but no one i know can verify if it works. a quick search finds no such cable which verifies that you'll have to stick with known solutions like s video to scart. bob
