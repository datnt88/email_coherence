i just purchased an acer aspire m3300-u1332 computer. the specs include amd phenom ii x4 810 2.60ghz processor 6gb ddr3 1066 memory 1 tb sata hard drive integrated ati radeon hd 3200 graphics card vga and hdmi monitor ports two 5.25 inch bays three 3.5 inch bays windows 7 home premium 64-bit os one dvdrw optical drive 300 watt psu i bought this on the spur of the moment because i thought i was getting a good deal at $500 with no tax and free shipping. however, no disks came with it. so my question is &quot;do you think this really is a good deal or should i exchange it before the 30-day period expires for something with a better reputation for quality, reliability and customer service.&quot; thank you.
that gpu is quite at the low end. the price is ok but i'd skip this one for any i3 powered machine and a better gpu. bob
what gpu do you recommend? i don't do gaming, just e-mails, net surfing, photo editing and slide shows. is acer a reliable brand?
i've yet to see anything i'd call reliable. just one mistake and the os fails. just one malware and it's failing. this is not reliable. sorry but reliable is something i write about toasters and refrigerators, not computers. bob
i understand. you pay your money and take your chances. what gpu do you recommend?
presents it in an easy to understand what you can get for the money. i like that list. it's also what i use when i shop for a new card. bob
