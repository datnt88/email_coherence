i am trying to recover photos from a damaged maxtor 80 gb hard drive. i tried slaving it on my other computer, but my system would not start (tried all different variations of jumper settings). i then placed it in a hard drive enclosure and it is visible under disk drives, but not listed in my computer. when i go to disk management, it appears as an unknown device and i am prompted to initialize the disk. will initialization delete the data on the drive?
the cnet storage forum. it's at the top of that other forum. read that. in short, try other titles like zero assumption recovery, getdataback, recuva and testdisk. good hunting and no!! do not initialize that drive!!! bob
try ntfs data recovery utilities (your choice) as listed as links :
