<s> i need to get an external hard drive (my 3rd). the first 2 were from owc, and incorporated a hitachi drive mechanism.  </s>
<s> but now i see that owc has switched to using seagage barracuda (probably for price reasons).  </s>
<s> the hitachi is truly high-end, and super-reliable.  </s>
<s> but what about seagate barracuda?  </s>
<s> opinions?  </s>
<s> bytecc case and maxtor drive.  </s>
<s> this way i can pick and choose.  </s>
<s> i recommend the western digital caviar se16 hard drive.  </s>
<s> it is 7200rpm and has 16mb cache.  </s>
<s> i recommend the addonic ae5sacsuf enclosure.  </s>
<s> it supports sata i, sata ii, and ide.  </s>
<s> this enclosure connects to your computer either by firewire or usb 2.0.  </s>
<s> this enclosure is very sturdy and the aluminum material is thick.  </s>
<s> it also uses the cypress chipset for usb.  </s>
<s> cypress are supposed to be good chipsets.  </s>
<s> however, that fan is loud.  </s>
<s> if you don't want to make your own, western digital has the my book external hard drive.  </s>
<s> thanks, i appreciate the advice.  </s>
