<s> what features to look for in a 120-160 gb usb drive and which mfg. i've researched and beyond the obvious specs whose is best thanks  </s>
<s> let's simplify &quot;best&quot; to three product categories.  </s>
<s> 1. speed.  </s>
<s> 2. longevity.  </s>
<s> 3. cost.  </s>
<s> you get to pick only two.  </s>

<s> i personally use an ultra external hdd case with a seagate 120gb hdd inside. the external hdd case does not come with a hard drive.  </s>
<s> i had to purchase a separate hard drive for it - chose the seagate 120gb, 7200rpm hard drive because the seagate is more reliable from my experience and the 120gb takes care of all my files.  </s>
<s> this combination was less expensive than any complete unit on the market at the time and it has both usb 2.0 and high speed firewire.  </s>
<s> this ultra has both a usb 2.0 and firewire connections.  </s>
<s> i use it to backup both my office and home machines.  </s>
<s> i purchased it through tigerdirect.com  </s>
<s> for about $50.  </s>
<s> i have used it for a year.  </s>
<s> i would recommend the ultra product to anyone.  </s>
<s> do the research and find what you like.  </s>
