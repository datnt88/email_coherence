i bought my vista 64 bit desktop 6 months ago and have been trying to connect two wireless laptops running xp. i have been all over looking for help on the web. hp will not help without paying more or will geek squad. i have a linksys router wrt54g that i am using and both wireless laptops connect to the internet fine, but just can't get a network. i have made sure all pcs have the same name and been through settings after settings. can anyone help?
vista has us install a network discovery item on xp. your post writes you've researched this but not a word about it. i see nothing about firewalls either. more at  when the lltd and more is covered. bob
thanks i followed that link and now i can see the 2 xp computers but not the vista. but it tells me i do not have access to the files. as far as firewall i am running kaspersky and no windows firewall.
how you manage accounts. let's say i'm on my xp machine as bob. i try to connect to that vista machine and get that message. bob may not have an account on that vista machine. it's simple if you think about it. bob
