<s> hi, i have a cisco linksys wag320n router at the moment and i am wondering what would be a suitable range extender to use.  </s>
<s> i really want the best one not too particular about the brand.  </s>
<s> i just can't really find many reviews of range extenders online.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> i find them to not always work with every router.  </s>
<s> because of that i use the old router as a wap solution.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hi vignesh, i have used the linksys wre54g in the past with clients and it has helped in all cases.  </s>
<s> it is best to use an extender that is of the same make.  </s>
<s> i hope this helps.  </s>
<s> the most popular one is the wre54g but not everyone prefers that model.  </s>
<s> if you take a look at the reviews on you will get tonnes of reviews on it.  </s>
<s> some people appear to prefer it just because its easy to use and you don't really have to be concerned about it being the &quot;best&quot;.  </s>
<s> but then there's a bunch of people who are interested in their latest releases which are just picking up steam.  </s>
<s> take a look either way and you'll find something on there.  </s>
