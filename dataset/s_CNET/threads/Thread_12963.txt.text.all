<s> me and my brother both have the same computer with all the same components.  </s>
<s> but yet we both bought the same game (football manager09) and it doesnt work on my computer.  </s>
<s> i read up to check my drivers for the graphics card but there seems to be none.  </s>
<s> its an internal graphics card how do i go about finding it and updating it.  </s>
<s> any help is appriciated  </s>
<s> driver that supports the onboard graphics chipset.  </s>
<s> there has to be some drivers installed or you would not be able to use your computer, so lets start with the make and model of pc you have and the os. from there, we can establish the new drivers needed, if necessary.  </s>
<s> btw: from the football managers 2009 website: you probably need a better graphics engine (new card)  </s>
<s> it was made for me the pc. im on windows xp and my brothers works fine i have a print screen of the details below when he typed in dxdiag in the run command when and the second link is of my pc wen i type it in the run command.  </s>
<s> only difference between our pc's is that i have formatted mine so i dont know weather or not i did something wrong my bros pc my pc thanks  </s>
<s> in the post for football manager, it shows, according to their requirements for the system, that you will need a better graphics than what is shown in the first picture link.  </s>
<s> go to the link from my first post for the football manager site and then do some shopping for a video card.  </s>
<s> first, however, we need to know about your system - like what motherboard you have and what type case and the size of the power supply.  </s>
<s> for the second picture link, you probably have not installed the motherboard drivers, so you need to do that.  </s>
<s> in order to do that you need to know the make and model of the motherboard and either use the driver cd that came with the motherboard or go to the manufactuere's website and download them and install.  </s>
