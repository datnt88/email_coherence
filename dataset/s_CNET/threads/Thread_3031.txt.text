hi! i have an elements by wd 400gb external hard drive. i have a small hard drive in my laptop, so i keep most of my information on this drive. i'd like to share it off of my desktop computer so i can access my files from anywhere in my house, but don't want the rest of my family messing with my drive. is there a free program to secure the drive, or even a windows utility? i'm running windows xp home sp2 on the desktop and laptop. thanks for your help! nick
it has file ownership, permissions and more. why complicate what xp supplies with more software? bob
sorry for being such a noob, but how do i do that?
there plenty more to be found (try google.com and ntfs primer) so take a few readings and explore what the os supplies natively. bob
