i am needing to replace my old cat5 patch cables in my comms room does anyone have a suggestion as to what are the best brand of cables to buy. i will be buying different colours depending on the job i am asking each cable to do. thanks in advance
this is a product like milk. you see brands at the store but all go fine with cheerios. the only thing you may want to do is to buy the normal as well as a &quot;crossover&quot; type so you know you have both types handy. bob
thanks for the reply bob the reason i asked was i was told that some of the cheaper pre cut cable is assembled in places like tiwan or china and they do not test there cables properly.
we buy ours from geeks.com and found one bad one in some thousand. i guess some would consider that unacceptable. bob
cat 5e patch cables will do the trick if all your other cabling is cat 5 or cat 5e. you will only be as good as the weakest part of your cabling network. i would match up with at least cat 5e. these guys have them starting at $.79/ea. and in lengths from 6 inches to 150 ft. and in 9 different colors
barry, i know i'm getting here late on this one but here's a link to our website that provides more cable options than you could dream of. you could also call at 724-746-5500, 24 x 7.  technical support team black box network services
