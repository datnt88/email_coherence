ok, i just got a radeon x1900xtx. i noticed it came with a composite as well as an s-video cable...does this mean i could plug this into my pc and then plug my playstation 2 into it and play console games on my pc monitor?
you supplied a chip make/number but not the make/model of the video card so i can't tell if it has video in which would make this possible. some see the cable and think aha, this should work but don't think about the ins and outs. bob
oops..haha sorry. it's video in if it does allow me to plug a playstation 2 into it (it does, i tried, but not sure if that's what it's meant for) how would i go about having it display on screen? i dont' see any kind of option for that.
oh and not sure on the make model. it has the name on the box and it says avivo and a few other things. it's pci express ati official brand if that helps
shows avivo is some nice marketing fluff. you might be able to just connect your video out from the ps2 to the video in, run up the supplied software to see if this works. sorry but with specific model numbers (even better a link to the card) i can only write generalities. bob
hope this helps...
and a dozen other sites and i can't find video in. i see a s-video output. do you have the product? you may have something better than what they offer. bob
