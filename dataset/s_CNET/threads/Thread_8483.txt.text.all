<s> i replaced a lynksys router with belkin n+ router.  </s>
<s> i am having internet connection issues.  </s>
<s> i worked with belkin support.  </s>
<s> they updated the firmware, changed channel but the wireless internet speed is 20% of the cable modem speed.  </s>
<s> i have 2 laptops with windows xp. i also would like to connect my 1tb portable drive to the usb port.  </s>
<s> please suggest the settings for this router.  </s>
<s> i will be so greatful.  </s>
<s> did you also replace all your interface cards in your pc's.  </s>
<s> you will not run n unless all your equipment is n. the n routers are designed to run n best.  </s>
<s> they will run g and b also but that does not mean they do as good a job as router designed for those.  </s>
<s> one of the main differences is the antenna layout.  </s>
<s> first plug directly into the router with a lan cable and see if it runs faster.  </s>
<s> you can also place your pc as close as possible to your router running on the wireless and see if it runs faster.  </s>
<s> thanks for this insight.  </s>
<s> i thought, it might have something to do with &quot;n&quot; but not enough to know that my interface cards need to support &quot;n&quot;.  </s>
<s> i have not changed any interface cards on the computers and do not plan to.  </s>
<s> so, i will be getting the &quot;g&quot; router.  </s>
<s> any suggestions one better than other.  </s>
<s> i have ordered the linksys (as i used to have that).  </s>
<s> if there is another suggestion, please advise.  </s>
<s> thanks..  </s>
<s> wireless n has no advantages over g in that regard.  </s>
<s> in fact, wireless b is faster than most broadband other than those advertised as &quot;turbo&quot; and such.  </s>
<s> wireless g is already 8x or faster than average broadband. the only advantage that n would provide over g would be within your local area network.  </s>
