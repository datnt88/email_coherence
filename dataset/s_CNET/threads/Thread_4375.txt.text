hello. i have a friend who has a sony cd drive. the os installesd is windows 98 se, pentium 2 192 mb ram. when i put a rw cd in the drive, it can not read the cd. when i put a non burnt cd in it could read it after a few tries. (there is currently no cd burning software installed). can anyone help me with this?
have you tried a new cdrw drive or a lens cleaner? bob
