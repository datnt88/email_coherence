<s> hi, i was hoping if someone could tell me how to booktype my sony drx840u 20x external dual-layer dvd burner.  </s>
<s> thanks alot  </s>
<s> what software are you using to write your dvd's?  </s>
<s> imgburn will booktype if your drive supports it.  </s>
<s> if you do not know if your drive supports it, try dvdinfo or nero's drivespeed to check.  </s>
<s> your software does that and your drive supports it.  </s>
<s> but!!! this has never been the reason why your dvds created in said drives don't play on dvd players.  </s>
<s> don't waste people's time chasing down that dead end.  </s>

<s> hi, the programs i use are clone dvd and 1 click dvd copy pro.  </s>
<s> i like them because they rip and burn.  </s>
<s> does img burn do the same???  </s>
<s> hi absoluttely, i have a very old nec dvd burner single layer.  </s>
<s> i downloaded firmware and flashed the drive.  </s>
<s> now it burns +r to dvd-rom.  </s>
<s> also it know supports double layer recording.  </s>
<s> how do you explain that ?? the reason for my post is because i did it such a long time ago that i have forgotten how to do it and do not want to brick my drive.  </s>
<s> i just want to play videos for family who still own old dvd players that do not support +r or -r.  </s>
<s> i decline to duplicate web content about firmware updates that add capability.  </s>
<s> if you want to discuss it, supply links to the firmware and the drive so i don't have to dig it up. the booktype and it's relationship to dvd(+/-r) media not playing is well discussed.  </s>
<s> it's not the solution and as such i will not discuss it.  </s>
<s> why?  </s>
<s> it's a deadend.  </s>
