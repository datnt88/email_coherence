hi, ive started building a new computer but i was wonderind, since my old hard drive had windows 98 on it but i upgraded to windows xp home ed. if i could just install the old hard drive and not have to buy the full copy of xp. if this is possible it would save me some money for other componets. thanks.
let's take that forward in time. xp crashes and you have your xp upgrade cd but no windows 98 cd. what will you do then? i can't count how many set themselves up for a future problem. bob
changes you'll likely have to revalidate xp by telephone with ms. if you can keep a record of the new set of alphanumerics they give you it might work if you again have to revalidate. not sure though.
thnnnxxxxxxxx guys so much for the help. i guess i never relly thought wht i would do if it crashed. thnxx again.
