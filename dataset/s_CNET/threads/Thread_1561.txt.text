hey guys, i purchased a new seagate 500gb sataii 7200.10 16mb hard drive. it's my first time with a sata drive. i installed xp on it, everything was working good. i then went to restart, when i noticed that the pc wont boot all the time with this new hard drive. sometimes when i reboot, it'll boot right into windows.. then, other times when i reboot, on the last page before displaying the windows loading screen, it'll just sit, with the little underscore in the top left corner. sometimes i have to reboot 5 times before it'll boot up. other times it'll boot up right away. i do not get any messages or errors, and no weird beeps. any idea what i can do to fix this? it's simple enough to just keep rebooting, but it does become a pain... thanks alot!!! ====================== here's my system specs: intel c2d e6600 cooled by thermalright xp 90-c & arctic silver 5 evga 8800gts 640mb thermaltake xaser iii - 8 fans 2 x 1gb drr2 667 500gb seagate sataii 7200.10 16mb sound blaster x-fi platinum 7.1 w/ logitech z5500 17&quot; lg lcd 8ms ocz gamexstream 600w asus p5l-d2
jumper hdd to satai ? vapcmd
not sure..try scanning for bad sectors maybe? just throwing ideas out there. try maybe a different sata connector on the mobo and see if that helps.
the jumper was removed, making it sataii. i ran seatools for windows, and it passed. my mobo supports both sata and ii. i have plugged it into all of the other sata connectors to make sure, and it still does the same. thanks guy.. any other ideas?
if that doesn't work...i'd try setting the hdd back to sata ...retest. how current is the mb bios ? vapcmd
i have never updated the bios. should i give it a go? if so, how does the program for windows by asus work for upgrading the bios? i'd prefer to do it that way, then via dos, or whatever it would be.
go to the asus site and post your question/scenario in the forum for your motherboard. much easier to get specific you need there. i've never used anything other than the dos version to update a mb bios...suggest seeing the bios notes for your mb to see if they address the problem you're experiencing. vapcmd
