i have two computers,1 is a compaq presario using xp home edition the other is a e machine using home xp edition. i used the wizzard to set up a network and can get connectivity but the slave wants to use the modem to dial up instead of seeing the network? i get the icon network connected. do i need to disable the modem on the slave? what am i doing wrong here? jerry thanks
if setting the network control panel to use only the lan didn't take, just use the device manager to disable the modem. bob
you indicated you used the wizard to configure your home network. so i assume you set up the internet connection sharing and etc already. did you also go into your internet explorer &quot;options&quot; and change your &quot;connection&quot; settings on your &quot;slave&quot; machine? if not, go into your internet &quot;properties&quot; and under the &quot;connections&quot; tab there should be some radio buttons. select the one that says &quot;never dial a connection.&quot; this should disable the modem. if your connection does not work after this, you may want to try to &quot;setup&quot; your connection again. and when you do this choose the option to use your lan connection. the wizard should walk you through it.
