<s> i have a nook tablet and was trying to use a google maps satellite view or google earth to use as my gps when boating. i have a cell phone that puts out wifi that i hook up to.  </s>
<s> i tried to get google maps to use my location but it kept saying unable to determine location.  </s>
<s> my phones screen is to small to see while driving the boat. is there anyway that i can get the nook tablet to show my phones screen kind of like how you can get your computer screen to show your cells screen?  </s>
<s> if not do any tablets allow you to do this that are not extremely expensive.  </s>
<s> also i wouldnt mind getting a tablet that would let me use my phones wifi and use google maps that would allow the my current position feature.  </s>
<s> sorry for the long post.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> if anyone has any other ideas im all ears( i live in louisiana and the marsh where i fish is not displayed well on most gps systems that is why the google earth view is so good.) thanks  </s>
<s> i'd move to some tablet with a gps like the newer google nexus at you'll still need to preload maps and possibly enable the wifi hotspot on the phone.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i use an app called foxfi that lets me use the internet on the tablet  </s>
