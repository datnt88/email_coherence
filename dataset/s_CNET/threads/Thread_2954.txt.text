i have been facing few problems in finding enclosure. i have bought 3 different type of enclosure till date and all of them are off in dimension by few millimeters and hence not working. it is for 2.5&quot; sata internal harddrive 80gb from my 1 year old hp laptop. any recommendations will be surely appreciated. thanks harvijay
why not drill or modify to make it work? if not, have someone else do this.
can't do it man, it is cheap made in japan product made up of plastic, and will break if i use it to drill or modify.
i've used simple hand tools to tweak such into shape. if you must buy, here i use the local shops like frys, then newegg.com and geeks.com but given your past story i wonder what's amiss. bob
