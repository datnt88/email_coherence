<s> hi, can anybody let us know the default username and password for the failsafe account of summit x450e-48p extreme networks switch.  </s>
<s> thanks,  </s>
<s> see your other thread.  </s>
<s> you don't tell anything about what support you have on this device.  </s>
<s> - isn't that in the manual?  </s>
<s> - and can't the support dept of the manufacturer or the company that installed it for you tell you?  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> nothing written in manuals about failsafe default username and password.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> i forget the exact user id been a long time since i did this. the password is a firmware thing.  </s>
<s> they ask you for the serial number of the box and input into a program which generates the password.  </s>
<s> it is unique for each unit.  </s>
<s> needless to say they protect that program since you could break into anyones equipment just knowing the serial number......they want to make money off it from people like you.  </s>
