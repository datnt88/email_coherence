<s> i have a brother multi function 8680 dn laser printer and it operates with windows xp home.  </s>
<s> although i like the printer my only issue is that brother support tells me that the only way for the date & time to work is to initially leave the printer on for 48 hours to charge the battery and not shut it off for more than a day or two (leave in sleep mode).  </s>
<s> if i shut it off for a few days, it resets to a default 1/1/2010 setting and i lose fax logs.  </s>
<s> why would any printer with an uninterrupted power source require being on continuously to maintain it's date in time.  </s>
<s> in an era of trying to cut power consumption, this would seem to be a poor design feature particularly if a large organization had hundreds of printers.  </s>
<s> please comment  </s>
<s> i had the same problem with my first refurbished 8680dn unit i got from staples.  </s>
<s> i realized this was a defect, so i returned it for a replacement unit.  </s>
<s> my replacement unit does not have such a problem.  </s>
<s> hi: my unit is new, i called brother and an affiliated service unit and they told me that it must be turned on almost continuously.  </s>
<s> it doesn't make sense.  </s>
<s> and, i won't buy another hp model as hp is difficult to deal with and their solutions after a couple of years is to buy, buy, buy!  </s>
<s> by the way, what was the defect in your unit?  </s>
