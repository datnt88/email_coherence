<s> on this black friday, i purchased dell xps desktop with huge discount.  </s>
<s> almost half price of right this moment's price.  </s>
<s> however recently while i am researching about dell computer, i found out that quality of dell computer parts are really low and they are using cheap parts.  </s>
<s> return policy period is not past and i kept every boxes and every parts of set.  </s>
<s> thus i am able to return the product.  </s>
<s> do you guys think that i should return the computer?  </s>
<s> you may as well return it if you can.  </s>
<s> then, you can pay twice the price for something else and, the next day, wonder, again, if you made the right decision.  </s>
<s> is it real that dell computer is using cheap and low quality parts ?  </s>
<s> based on what i have seen on the web, i know that among pre-built computer.  </s>
<s> it has at least a year warranty so would your quality desktop per year be more or less?  </s>
<s> dell parts are no better or worse than any other oem maker......i suppose not to include apple.  </s>
<s> if you go around the web you will find a 1000 post bitching about dell.  </s>
<s> why is that?......................dell sells a gazillion machines.  </s>
<s> i'm looking at a couple of year old dell desktop.......works fine.  </s>
<s> i'm with you, dell is as good as any ready made boxes on the market. the only way to get a zoot kick butt whiz bang set up is to build it yourself, which many of us do or spend a bunch of loot and get an alienware unit...or the alternative go to mac.  </s>
<s> this is entirely up to you if you feel you got a raw deal.  </s>
<s> imho, dell uses the same parts except for the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> that everyone else uses.  </s>
<s> sure, they buy in bulk, but so does everyone else.  </s>
<s> unless, your dell falls apart, then it's just as good as any other oem based pc out there.  </s>
<s> if you want, check 3rd party builders and check prices.  </s>
<s> also, remember you get the s/w bundle and ows which in many cases a huge hunk of the purchase, so beware of other vendors that offer a pc, yet you pay extra at least for the os or its a billable item.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i got the fact that dell's parts are same with any other oem computers, but how about compare with &quot;building my own computer.&quot;  </s>
<s> if prices are equal, for sure, quality of built computer will be better compare to manufactured computer, but how much different?  </s>
<s> because i also considering about building my own computer with money i receive from dell if i return the desktop.  </s>
<s> what you guys think?  </s>
<s> i've lost count of posts where folk build their own only to discover installing windows is just as bad as it was 20 years ago.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> go here.  </s>
<s> price out the parts you want.  </s>
<s> don't forget the os. your call.  </s>
