<s> i've scanned my hard drive with western digital data lifeguard diagnostics and hdtune and they both came back saying my hard drive has bad sectors.  </s>
<s> does bad sectors mean that my hard drive has physical damage to it and is not fixable.  </s>
<s> that's exactly what it means.  </s>
<s> now it is your choice to replace it, backup your files or &quot;your choice&quot; what to do next.  </s>
<s> i'm sure someone will write about sector sparing and more but if there were spares then the drive would have already done this and you would not be asking.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> now i just need to get a new hard drive and in the mean time i'll backup what i can.  </s>
<s> thank you again.  </s>
