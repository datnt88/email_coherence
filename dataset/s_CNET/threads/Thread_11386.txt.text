hi i was wondering if my printer will work if i switched to 64 bit computing. i am talking about the office. we have a few printers and the 4-5 pcs can access them as necessary. right now we work with 32 bit computers. if we were to switch, what would i have to do to make the printers work? intels processors are said to work seamlessly with 64 and 32 tasks. now does that mean that i can install windows xp or vista 64 bit editions on my computers while utilizing 32 bit printer drivers? if this does not work then can i get a print server and connect multiple printers and computers and make 64 bit computers work with the printers? i will have to check out if 64 bit drivers are available or not. my questions are for the time when there are no printer drivers available. thank you
unless your staff can write drivers then you need to stay off the 64-bit versions of this os. while a print share might be visible on the network, it doesn't mean you can print to it. bob
here's what happens when a big change takes place, i've noticed: 1) wait and see 2) not supported 3) will work for x-models 4) you need something more(options) 5) patches, fixes or updates required if none of the above seems to be the answer, guess what, they are. alot of time, big changes mean a &quot;break aawy time&quot; for makers/vendors and time to upgrade or update if you want to keep in the loop. more often than not, unpopular or unique devices get left behind. however, &quot;the squeaky wheel gets the oil&quot; does apply over time if enough noise is made, but again sometimes not. tada -----willy
i had numerous driver problems after upgrading to win 64. printers, webcam, dazzle 150. after contacting the manufactures and being told no drivers were currently in development i immediatly re-installed win xp home. new os's can be great but before up grading confirm your hardware has available 64 bit drivers.
everyone! so that kind of finalises it. i will not consider 64 bit processing for the time being.
