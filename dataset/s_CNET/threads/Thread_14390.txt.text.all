<s> the motherboard in my computer is asus a7n8x-x with 3 memory slots, and it can be installed up to 3gb ddr 400mhz(pc3200) of ram memory.  </s>
<s> however, it exists also a single module of 2gb ddr 400mhz(pc3200) of ram memory.my  </s>
<s> question is can i install (3 x2gb) 6 gb of ram memory?  </s>
<s> i know that on motherboard description says up to 3gb, but i suppose that it is possible, that this 2gb module entered the production after the motherboard.  </s>
<s> so, can anyone help me with this question?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> first if your manual says 3gig, that's probably correct.  </s>
<s> beyond that if you have a 32bit operating system (which is more than likely) you would be wasting money as it can't use more than 3-3.5gig depending on your hardware.  </s>
<s> if you are running xp 32bit 2 gig is plenty, just because you have 3 slots doesn't mean they have be full.  </s>
<s> go with the system specs...not what you 'think' will fit.  </s>

<s> 'hvala puno' anmor i vapcmd.that  </s>
<s> means 'thank you very much' in my language:).  </s>
<s> anyway, i wanted to improve my ram memory because i want to install windows vista.curruntly  </s>
<s> my operating system is windows xp and i have 512mb of ram memory installed.how  </s>
<s> much would be enough for vista?  </s>
<s> just one question more:) can i expect any problems if i install the same memory ( ddr 400 mhz (pc3200), but from a different manufacturer.my  </s>
<s> ram memory is manufactured by kingston.  </s>
<s> well, hvala puno, for the second time:)  </s>
<s> to run vista comfortably, if you do a lot of video edditing or other memory intensive programs go to 3. i suspect that is not the case with you as you have been getting along on 512mb.  </s>
<s> best to buy 2 gig of quality ram which is suitable for your computer, then trying to get more and cheaper.  </s>
<s> i would get 2 x 1gb to match what is recomended, you should be able to still use your current module giving you 2.5gb which will be more than enough.  </s>
<s> mfg and series wherever possible.  </s>
<s> that's why it's always best to get the max amount ram you anticipate to need when you buy the pc .... it's so much easier to get it then than trying to match the original ram later.  </s>
<s> cheers and you're most welcome.  </s>
