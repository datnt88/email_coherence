i will be buying a new desktop soon. i can't build my own and i'm not interested in having one built by a local shop. do any of the well known computer companies offer us based telephone support?
they haven't moved it all out yet and with the apple there appears to be less need to call support. i'm curious. what reasons do you call support lines for? bob
bob, i normally don't call support lines but might have to if a new computer has problems or if there is something i don't understand. i'm running a 5 year old dell that has had no problems other than the time i installed some beta software and had to reinstall windows. i needed some help with that. macs aren't a consideration for me but i do appreciate your response.
it's downright pleasant compared to windows. it even asks if i want to retain my files. does windows even ask? something's very wrong with windows in my opinion. it treats our files with such disrespect and installing does take a guru. why not switch? bob
i had to use them for several years when working at a school district. just didn't like them at all. maybe no windows based company has us support. if not, i guess i will just stay with dell again.
