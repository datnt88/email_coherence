i have intel(r) 845 chipset & my o/s is xp home. how do i do a reset?
your post lacks any details as to what problem you want to resolve. chipsets are not reset. more info is needed.
maybe you are confusing with a bios reset. if you have the mobo book, it'll tell you how. else, open the computer, pull out the button battery (you can't miss it - you may only damage the mounting if not careful! ) wait for about ten minutes and put it back. warning! if you are not aware of the bios settings and what they mean, get a knowledgable person to do this.
