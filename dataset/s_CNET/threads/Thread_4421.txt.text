it's between these graphic cards: 2 x 3 gb gddr5 amd&#174; radeon&#8482; hd 7950 crossfirex , or single - 4gb nvidia geforce gtx 690 grafikkort which graphic card should i choose?
some gamers will do this in search of 1 more frame per second. i'd rather see you pick off the list at this link.  -&gt; for most i advise the single card. most shops and owners can't setup more than one card. bob
i'm ordering from alienware i think they have the dual graphics under control
at the end is the card that is rated 100% across the board. but i fear folk that drop 1,000 bucks on a card may expect more. bob
