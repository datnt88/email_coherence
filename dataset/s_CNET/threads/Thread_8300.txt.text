i have a phenom 9600 and i want to have it ready for empire total war.
overclocking. there are so many variables i decline to list them here. it's research time. maybe you can narrow the search by putting in google: overclock phenom 9600
most phenoms struggle to get past 2.8ghz and many top out at 3.0ghz after *a lot* of twiddling. also the oc strategy differs between chipsets (amd vs. nvidia). post your config and question to this forum for more help:
and it's covered ad nauseam. if you repost...be sure to include your system details.. systems from big box mfgs are generally not designed for overclocking no matter what cpu you have. vapcmd
