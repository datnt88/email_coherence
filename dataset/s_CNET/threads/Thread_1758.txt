(i know that these components in the 386/486 aren't worth saving. or are they?) if you're scratching your head wondering why i think a pentium 1 component may be worth keeping, it's because i'm using a pentium 1 (windows nt 4.0) for non-internet use. would be perfect if not for the paltry 2gb hard drive. one final question: how does hp pavilion 6535 compare to the pentium 1? i have searched on the internet, but can't find the year the hp was released. i will say this, though - the hdd is in an upright position and everything is jammed together to make it impossible to remove and insert cables, power supply cords, etc. several times i wanted to take this particular computer out onto the street and smash it apart. thanks!
