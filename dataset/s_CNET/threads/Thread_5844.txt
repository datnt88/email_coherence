8755	3	349472	3078980	3078738	vapcmd	7/11/09 7:45 am	1.2472983e12	have you tested the ram with memtest86+ or checked the psu	voltages to see if they're in spec ? what ram are you using ? vapcmd
8755	4	349472	3079480	3078980	mattinurmi	7/11/09 8:56 pm	1.24734576e12	im not sure if memtest86+ is compatible with windows 7	i am using ddr2 4gb vitesta 2 chip which is compatible with the motherboard. i found reviews about my motherboard that i am using and found out there is something with the ga-ep45-ud3r that makes the ram unstable. i used a voltage calculator on &quot;  and put in everything i am using and found out i only need to use a 333w psu but i have 650ws. thanks.

8755	7	349472	3080115	3079736	mattinurmi	7/12/09 7:12 pm	1.24742592e12	the test went for about 33 minutes	i checked the +12v line reading and it said 12.175v, is this a problem? i am running 4 hdd's and i asked the computer technicians to make it into 2 or 3 i think this is possible am i correct or do i have to reinstall the os again? when i was going through the bios settings i found out the drams performance was set on turbo so it was being overclocked for all this time, i switched it back to standard so i think there is more stabillity now then before. could this be the problem?
8755	8	349472	3080124	3080115	vapcmd	7/12/09 7:56 pm	1.24742856e12	run the ram overnight....just to be sure.	re the 12v ....12.17v reading is fine. i am running 4 hdd's and i asked the computer technicians to make it into 2 or 3 i think this is possible am i correct or do i have to reinstall the os again? are you running raid ? when i was going through the bios settings i found out the drams performance was set on turbo so it was being overclocked for all this time, i switched it back to standard so i think there is more stabillity now then before. could this be the problem? if it's running more reliably with ram turbo off ... leave it off. are you sure the cpu is running at the design speed ? vapcmd
