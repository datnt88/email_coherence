<s> i plan to copy my record albums directly onto my desktop hard drive.  </s>
<s> i will then copy them onto an external hard drive.  </s>
<s> i would like to copy all of the files from the first external hard drive onto a 2nd external hard drive.  </s>
<s> can this be accomplished?  </s>
<s> i don't want to keep the info on my desktop hard drive as it is not that large and i plan to erase it once i have it on the external hard drive.  </s>
<s> i don't have two external hard drives at this time but i have thought i could buy two and take turns loading the files onto each one,however i thought if i have an external hard drive with 300-500 or more gigs of music it would be easier to copy from one hard drive to another and i could give the one away to a friend who gave me the albums to begin with.  </s>
<s> any thoughts?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> that externals are turning out to be less reliable than anyone expected.  </s>
<s> sure, do what you want but be sure that anything that is not backed up is something you can lose.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thank you bob for your response.  </s>
<s> i will take that into consideration as i proceed.  </s>
<s> however i still am not sure i can copy from one external hard drive to another.  </s>
<s> i assume i can simultaneously plug both into the usb ports on the desktop and then drop the files from the 1st external hard drive i have been saving to over the weeks into the 2nd external hard drive.  </s>
<s> correct?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> the only time i run into an issue is with usb powered drives.  </s>
<s> some laptops don't have enough power to the ports and i'll have to use this sort of cable -&gt; so yup.  </s>
<s> usually fine.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> version 1.52 does work with xp and vista.  </s>
<s> it will simplify your file transfers.  </s>
<s> i see someone posted a file manager ( ) let me share another that goes one step further to distance itself from possible crashes when a corrupt or unsupported jpeg or avi is encountered.  </s>
<s> look at bob  </s>
<s> yep. do it pretty regularly.  </s>
<s> i have several externals that i have multiple file back-ups and simply plug both into the laptop and copy away.  </s>
<s> mostly one of those drives has an external power source and the other is usb powered, but once in awhile both are usb powered and that seems okay on my toshiba laptop.  </s>
