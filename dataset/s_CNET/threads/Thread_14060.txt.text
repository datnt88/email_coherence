is there a way to setup a thumb drive where windows reads the autorun.inf like on a cd? i do not want the autorun option menus to come up, just the program to launch. i need it to do this for any computer it is attached to. is that possible?
widely documented so i'll just end here. bob
i'm setting this up for a blind person who has an installation cd for a program that allows the computer to talk. when i try to set this up, windows doesn't just run the program. it gives a list of options, one of which is to run the program. i want it to just go directly to setup.exe when the drive is inserted.
as to why the usb didn't autorun i can't see your work so i can't guess what you did. i won't duplicate how cd autorun works since it's widely documented. bob
