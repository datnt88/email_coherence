i want to buy one of them . plz suggest me which one is better between &quot;apple ipad&quot; and &quot;samsung galaxy tab&quot; and why ??????????
the good news is that the apple/droid/wp7 dustup is well discussed. the bad news is that you didn't reveal what your criteria would be to select one or the other. i can reveal that for me the bluetooth serial port profile is a deal breaker. the ipad doesn't have it so no sale. bob
samsung glaxy tab is very dishonest.7inch android2.2 a8 capacitive screen, just such a configuration but price is ridiculously high.if you do not mind the price, you can think about it and to buy.
