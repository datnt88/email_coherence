(set bios to pci if i added a pci card, or agp if i installed an agp card. save and reboot.) do i need to check if my bios is set for pci i recall seeing a message saying no pci slots filled when radeon was in. plus i only have pci slots in my pc . 6. move monitor connection if need be.ok 7. let windows boot. ok 8. just ok all the errors. hmmm ok 9. install the drivers. ok
