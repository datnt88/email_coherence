we have a dsl connection with a linksys 'b' wireless router in my sons room. our apartment is long with a great deal of distance from his end of the apartment to the other. my office area is maybe 60 or 70 feet from the router and the wirelss connection on my laptop doesn't work when at my desk in the office and i have to use dial up. i can use my laptop to connect wirelessly when i am nearer to the router. we are working with windows xp. what can i do to get a strong signal in my office area? do i get another router to put in the middle of the range? do i use an access point (which is something i am unfamiliar with)? thanks for any help.
1) get a pair of those extender antenna linksys markets 2) move the router to a more centralized location (requires running cable) 3) add an access point 4) go to a mimo router and adapters
since you only need to point the signal in that direction, head to the kitchen and whip up this antenna reflector. new.freeantennas.com/projects/template/ copy/paste that into your browser address. bob
