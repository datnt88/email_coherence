<s> i have a compaq v5101us laptop and im often sitting right next to a power outlet while working on it.  </s>
<s> my thoughts were to always just plug it in while im on it but i that that is bad for some batteries on some other types of devices other than computers and i was wandering if it is also bad for the computer.  </s>
<s> should i just run it on battery and then charge it when it is low and then run it on battery again, or just always plug it in when i can and run it on full like that?  </s>
<s> will one promote longer battery life?  </s>
<s> thanx for the responces  </s>
<s> i challenged that notion at and you might save 10% of the battery life over a year one way versus the other.  </s>
<s> but we use the laptops as desktops and the noted article is rather pessimistic as to the desktop notebook temperature so my outlook is that this is more urban legend than fact.  </s>
<s> read and decide.  </s>
<s> we leave the battery in and they last years.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanx! it sounds as if you have done this with multiple computers so im going to trust you.  </s>
<s> unless someone tells me otherwise.  </s>
<s> thanx again!  </s>
