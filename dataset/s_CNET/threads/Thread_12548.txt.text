just set up a typical 2-pc home network (a desktop & a laptop).... both pcs running vista printer is local to desktop & shared successfully found & added the shared printer on the laptop system problem: when sending a single test document from the laptop, the print queue (which started w/ zero documents) now shows a count of 2 documents, but only the job i sent is listed in the pending documents; and that job never prints on the desktop side, no pending documents are listed; however, when i print from the desktop, the job shows up briefly on the laptop queue (as it should) if i cancel the test document on the laptop, a count of 1 still remains on the print queue, but no documents are in the list what am i missing?? big thanks to anyone that can help
msft (see google) tends to call these issues cosmetic as the system works but does what you wrote about. since it works, the printer prints they may leave such a bug unfixed. this can upset those that have no history with msft. ok, one idea. manually clear the print queue. here's a google on that. but my thought is if it is printing, why fix this?  bob
hi, bob. thanks for the reply. i did clear the queue (cancel the document) manually. upon doing so i noted that the printer status window still showed that there was &quot;1&quot; document, although none listed in the queue. it appears to me that the os is creating something that is put &quot;first in line&quot; before my document ultimately, my document never printed from the laptop. (no problems printing from the desktop) i hope my attempt at this clarification is helpful. thanks again.
uninstall the printer entirely and make a new instance. again, a msft issue. they really need to make this stuff better. bob
