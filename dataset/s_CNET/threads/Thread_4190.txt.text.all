and i want to take the files (i.e. music, pictures, word, games, etc) from the old computer and put them on new one. 
is that possible? 
if so, how do i go about doing it without bringing viruses for the old computer to the new one? 
i basically want all of my old information on the newer, faster machine. 
both computers are gateways, both desktops, both run on xp. i don't know what else you would need to know to solve this problem, so just ask i am basically upgrading as i have had the old one for over 4 years. 
oh and step by step directions (like you are telling your grandmother) would be great. 
sorry but that's the truth. 
just above grandma skills and i would refer to this link.

my computer knowledge as a whole is not that of someone's grandmother, but since i have never moved info from one computer to another, i really don't know what i am doing in that department. 
bottom line, all you need is your data . 
.pics, docs , e-mail, etc., and maybe you internet favorites. 
you'll have to reinstall any apps on the new pc...they cannot be transferred vapcmd
