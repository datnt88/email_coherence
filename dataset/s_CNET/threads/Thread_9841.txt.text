my friend has a western digital 500 gb external hard drive. disk has 2 firewire ports and 1 usb port. i want to connect this hard drive 2 pc at the same time. is it possible?
there was some work done with linux to do that but if you have the common windows machine just use a network share. bob
what you're trying to do is make a nas setup and that won't happen with a non-nas ext. hd. you are going to need a small network setup where the hd is attached to one system and the under the network become a &quot;shared resource&quot; for that network. if you plan to use multiple ports from that ext. hd to attach to separate systems, no workee or expect problems. tada -----willy
