<s> so a few months ago i upgraded my ram to 3gb, my power supply to 600w, and put in a diamond viper radeon x1950 pro (pci-e, 512mb) card.  </s>
<s> my problem is that there are games that i would like to buy...(ie: gears of war, crysis, bioshock etc...) however the box requirements list graphics cards for nvidia geforce etc...and that's not what i have... so does anyone know what nvidia cards are = to what i have?  </s>
<s> mine does support direct x 9.0 and i think even 10....  </s>
<s> there is no issue here.  </s>
<s> but it's not a geforce...  </s>
<s> i've wanted to play gears & bioshock since i saw it on the x-box... but i play ps3... i figured it would come out on the pc eventually.... now if i can get my controller to work with it.  </s>
<s> i assuming that world conflict will also be ok then...  </s>
<s> your card is a radeon from ati.  </s>
<s> your card supports dx9 only.  </s>
