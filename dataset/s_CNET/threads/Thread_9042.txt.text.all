<s> so we finally got some ram for our horribly under-ramed emachines w3623 running vista.  </s>
<s> it had 512mb and it was just unbearably slow.  </s>
<s> i bought a compatible 2gb ram chip, installed it and the computer is still as slow and task manager only shows 512(510)mb of the 2gb.  </s>
<s> i've tried reseating the ram twice and upgrading the bios but i've had no luck.  </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> 1. does the bios shows the ram?  </s>
<s> 2. is this the right ram?  </s>
<s> (link) 3. vista does have a limit memory setting but i'd like to see answers to 1 and 2 first since not all 2gb sticks work.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> based on the information in the link bob provided.  </s>
<s> i'd return what you bought and get 2gbs of ram at the link provided.  </s>
<s> &quot;memory type: ddr2 pc2-5300, ddr2 (non-ecc) maximum memory: 2gb slots: 2 each memory slot can hold ddr2 pc2-5300 with a maximum of 1gb per slot.*  </s>
<s> let us know.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> the others zero-in on your problem.  </s>
<s> allow me to explain further or in basic terms: your pc may allow a total of 2gb of ram installed but only as 1gb per ram slot.  </s>
<s> you can't defeat this and there is no word-around.  </s>
<s> there is the outside possibility of accepting that new 2gb stick alone provided the bios is updated to the latest release and even do that as a last resort, no sure thing.  </s>
<s> however, you maybe best served to return that new 2gb of ram and get 2x1gb ram set.  </s>
<s> imho, return and swap for true compatible ram sticks.  </s>
<s> also, you'll need to remove the 512mb ram stick in order to install the new 2x1gb set.  </s>
<s> tada ------willy  </s>
