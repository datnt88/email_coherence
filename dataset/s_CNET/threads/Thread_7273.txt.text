i am having some problems with my external hdd. lately, when i have tried to connect to any pc, i get an error message stating that the pc's usb port is experiencing a power surge of some kind and i am not able to get the hdd to start up. i have tried using the usb cord from my printer but i still get the same error message. can anyone help me with this problem? thanks
the bottom line is a patch is available for it. it can be machine specific and you didn't tell much about the machine. -&gt; ask the machine maker for the patch. bob
my hdd is a buffalo 120gb. i live in japan and bought the hard drive here. i am not sure if buffalo drives are sold in the us. could you point to where i find more info about the long discussion you mentioned or at least about the patch i should be looking for? thanks
not from the buffalo drive maker. it's for the pc. as to the long discussion, try  cheers, bob
thanks for the info. it seems like i am not the only one having this problem. i tried reading throught the posts but most of it was over my head. i am using a fujitsu fmv-820nub laptop. i am not sure if a patch or fix exists for that type of pc. is there any way to for me to patch or fix this problem? is there any kind of download from microsoft? if anyone can help me i would be most grateful
i've never had a problem with this one. everytime it's off to the board or system maker for the patch. if you can't find the patch they you call the supplier and ask where it is. best of luck, bob
