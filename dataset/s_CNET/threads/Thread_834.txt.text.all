i have heard a lot of reviews and testimonials on the internet about these two forms of encryption. 
i was wondering..which is better to run? 
on average how long would it take to crack each level of encryption...and how much would a 128 bit wep slow down the network when compared to 64 bit wep. 
any opinions? 
1. the longer bit encryption is better. 
2. some routers lose speed. 
&quot;reality&quot;. 3. use mac filtering to sidestep this issue and keep driveby hijackers off your lan.
