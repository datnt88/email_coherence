<s> i have heard a lot of reviews and testimonials on the internet about these two forms of encryption.  </s>
<s> i was wondering..which is better to run?  </s>
<s> on average how long would it take to crack each level of encryption...and how much would a 128 bit wep slow down the network when compared to 64 bit wep.  </s>
<s> any opinions?  </s>
<s> 1. the longer bit encryption is better.  </s>
<s> 2. some routers lose speed.  </s>
<s> &quot;reality&quot;. 3. use mac filtering to sidestep this issue and keep driveby hijackers off your lan.  </s>

<s> ok, thanks very much for the info  </s>
