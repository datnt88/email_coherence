i just went to load up a cd when my cd/dvd player didnt reconize it. i then tried a few other disk still nothing. im wondering if it has somthing to do with me recently formatting my computer. i checked the dirvers and they seem to be fine. anyone have a clu what the problem is? if so reply and ill aprreciate it. thanks all
on the microsoft operating system cd are so few drivers for motherboards and more that anyone that installs windows learns after awhile to install all the current drivers for everything. bob
already installed latest drivers but still isnt working.
in some systems if we forget to install drivers that does happen. also if we install nero, roxio and such can cause the drive to vanish (this was not mentioned so it's not that.) bob
to make sure i did this right i went in to device manger right cliked on my cd/dvd drive and went to teh driver section and clicked on teh update driver button. if there a different way please let me know. thanks
since all versions of windows have a cd driver that fails everytime. your posts have yet to follow the guideline of the words you see in red with each post. i'm left to guess what you've done to install this os. bob
this is quite normal if we forget drivers or install some cd recording software. be sure to heed those words in red so we can fix this. bob
