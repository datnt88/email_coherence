so i'm interested in getting a tablet. heres what i would like it to do, i want to be able to watch netflix, surf the internet, video chat, and get apps. i dont want an ipad. i'm looking for something in th 250 dollar range. i'd like to know what would be the best one for me. any ideas?
you just described a common android tablet. try this. see if the blackberry playbook (which can run android too) is still on sale. bob
thanks i will look into it.
another question how many gb should i get?
here i do fine with overkill. 32gb on my nook. it was thirty something for the microsd card.
