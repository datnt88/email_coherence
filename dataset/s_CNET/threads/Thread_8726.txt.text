a little while ago, i was advised that i could use ntfs-3g coupled with macfuse in order to backup a macbook to an ntfs formatted external hard drive. looks like this may be necessary, b/c my wife's macbook is having serious issues (has become ridiculously slow - don't know why). if i do this, and then get the machine repaired in a way that wipes her internal hard drive clean, should we be able to restore her machine from the ntfs-formatted external drive? i assume that i'll have to re-install ntfs-3g and macfuse before doing so, but after that, should i be able to restore the macbook?
you can restore the machine with the apple os dvd then install fuse then copy your files back. sorry that i misunderstood your needs. these two are different goals. 1. restore the macbook. 2. restore my files.
thanks - and no, you didn't misunderstand. it's only in the last day or so that we thought her hard drive might be in trouble; originally, i was just curious about backing up her data as a &quot;just in case&quot; sort of thing. much appreciated.
