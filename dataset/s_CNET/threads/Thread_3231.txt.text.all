<s> i'm a bit confused for the moment.  </s>
<s> my mobo manual says clearly that it &quot;supports 754-pin socket for amd athlon 64 processors...&quot; however, the amd site, when referring to the cpu installed, calls it a &quot;amd athlon 64 3000+ (socket 939).&quot; is there a typo or is there a problem?  </s>
<s> thanks rob  </s>
<s> you didn't say if you have the socket 939 processor, but if your mb is socket 754, it won't fit. the 939 is the newer version of the two.  </s>
<s> newegg.com has both for sale.  </s>
<s> you can go there to read the specs.  </s>
<s> the socket 754 athlon64 chips are for the socket 754 boards they support single channel ram aside from that they support most feaetures of the s939 boards, with the exception of sli, pcie and sata2  </s>
