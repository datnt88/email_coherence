i'm a newbie to wireless. i'd like to access a network via laptop. i'd be using two different laptops, both of which are wireless enabled. the main requirement is security. i've read a number of posts in this forum. it appears that the most popular router brands are more or less equal, and that the purchaser should take the time to update them and set them up properly. beyond that, if security overrides all other considerations, what steps should i take to maximize security?
sorry, i forgot to add that, if there's a previous thread that fully discusses my query, please just direct me to it. no need to do it all again. thanks
airsnort, kismet and kismac we can overcome almost any setting that your router provides. since you want &quot;maximum&quot; security you will have to look into more expensive solutions. sorry but that requirement means the supplied means are not going to work for you. bob
is insecure. anyone determined enough can intercept an encrypted signal and decode it (given time & money). do you still want wireless?
wpa2 encryption is still considered good and secure, this is the encryption you should use for improving your wireless security. most of the time you can determine how secure is your wireless network by setting up the network properly. have a quick look on this link on how to secure wireless network:  here is detailed explanation on how to set up wireless network:  hope this helps..
i looked on a new laptop and can't find wpa2. the story is that bad. please tell us why this is so. i'll start. it all has to do with federal export restrictions on encryption. for instance no one dare implement a secure public key method like pgp. -&gt; tell me more. bob
