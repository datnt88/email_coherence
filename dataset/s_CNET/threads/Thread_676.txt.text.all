<s> how do you back up your personal data?  </s>
<s> -- additional internal hard drive -- external hard drive -- memory card -- network-attached storage device -- online backup service -- optical disc -- tape -- usb thumb drive -- others (what is it?) -- what backup?  </s>
<s> (oh boy!)  </s>
<s> we use have our information backed up three ways- internel storage a nas external hdd (some is also on dvd which would mean we use four, but since not all of it is on dvd i did not include it.)  </s>
<s> preference will be as follows, - online backup - remote backup - network-attached storage device - external hard drive - additional internal hard drive  </s>
<s> all super critical data is saved on discs, like cd/dvd and flash drives.  </s>
<s> no other method is used for my needs.  </s>
<s> there are multiple copies and usually the amount of data is greatly reduced to the current needs, rather than a prolonged storage overs yrs.  </s>
<s> as example.  </s>
<s> i do however, like the fact, that once i upgrade to a new hd, i keep the old hd &quot;as is&quot; for several months not only as a safe return if something happens on new hd install but as a back-up version as well.  </s>
<s> once safe and sound, that old hd gets re-used.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> use acronis - home backup - scheduled daily to backup personal stuff (incremental) to a local 2nd drive.  </s>
<s> - every week or two i do a full image backup, using same software acronis.  </s>
<s> very easy to use.  </s>
<s> never done a restore, but there is a restore dvd that i created and should work fine :-/ restoring a file from backups is just toooo easy.  </s>
<s> just dive into the backup file, and browse round to the dated version that you want.  </s>
<s> i use syncback frequently to backup my data to an external hd and also to transfer my work between computers.  </s>
<s> but i am told i should also make a system image so i just bought some dvds to record one on.  </s>
<s> might also try a data backup to cd or dvd.  </s>
<s> i found out my complete image backup would take up 15 dvds or 700 floppies, so an external hd is more practical.  </s>
