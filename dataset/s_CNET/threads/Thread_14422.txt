5030	2	105406	1206891	1206266	therumble	5/24/05 4:24 pm	1.11695184e12	...	woah, calm down. i run frequent virus scans with several programs, and comes up. viruses aren't my problem.

5030	7	105406	1208522	1208157	therumble	5/25/05 1:09 pm	1.11702654e12	sure	i'm have alltel dsl at 1.5 mbps connection running through a regular router. anything else?
