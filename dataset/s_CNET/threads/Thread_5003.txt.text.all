<s> my boss has a cisco 350 series wap using an external antenna.  </s>
<s> he now wants a functionally equivalent set up for another location, but doesn't want to spend the $600+ of the original equipment.  </s>
<s> wireless aps start at around $50, and i've seen charts comparing low-cost brands (netgear, linksys, etc.).  </s>
<s> but before going that route, has anyone seen a spec sheet comparing cisco to other brands?  </s>
<s> would like to see what we'd be giving up by buying a more down-to-earth model.  </s>
<s> thanks jim  </s>
<s> first of all, that particular product you mention (cisco 350 series) is more $$$ than which other product?  </s>
<s> netgear, linksys, 3com etc. also have an expensive product line.  </s>
<s> usually they divided to two catagory 'managed' and 'unmanaged' device.  </s>
<s> those expensive product, usually have more software management or utility, so they can do much more than just (in this case) an access point.  </s>
<s> have a nice day  </s>
<s> my boss only asked &quot;why can't we buy a $125 wap?&quot;.  </s>
<s> this is for his personal/home use, and he does not need a managed device (despite the earlier choice).  </s>
<s> but he still needs reliability and security (& an external antenna connection).  </s>
<s> if the basic performance of most access points is similar, and the difference is in the number of bells & whistles, then maybe an inexpensive unit will do -- for example, a netgear me103.  </s>
<s> thanks, jim  </s>
