so almost every computer extra uses usb but some are starting to use firewire. is it worth it to add firewire ports to an old computer. and is faster/replacing usb?
fireware 800 (1394b) is significantly faster than both but there are very few firewire 800 devices. unless you have a digital camcorder or a specific need for firewire, there is no compelling reason to add a firewire card if you already have usb 2.
that will save me some money
