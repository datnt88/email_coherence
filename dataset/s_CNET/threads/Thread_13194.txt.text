been trying to rehook my wife's e machine to my network. it won't connect. it was connected and i think she screwed with settings but won't admit it. the network consists of 2 laptops and 2 desktops. her xp laptop hooks up ok. my laptop and desktop (both vista) both hookup ok. her desktop e-machine (xp) sees the network but won't connect. i am using belkin wireless adapters on both desktops and they are ok. it hooks up with ethernet cable ok. i've tried everything i can think of to get it to hook up but it just won't. using the linksys setup utility, it says that it is hooked up, but it isn't! i seem to be unable to find the network settings in xp. i don't want to re set the router (linksys wrt54gl) because then i will have to reinstall the 3 units that are working. anything i can do? abc's please. i'm senile and used to running vista now, can't remember xp stuff. thanks a bunch. george
the encryption on that machine. it has to be the same as those that are working properly.
i know that, but i can't seem to locate the place or means of checking the present settings.
