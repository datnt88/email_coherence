7141	2	284780	2709702	2709673	jnsarra	2/20/08 1:54 pm	1.20351564e12	thanks	i'm just a bit gun shy. when i boght my pre-intel pb i was assured by the apple store staff that it would be fast and able to run windows, etc. it turned out not to be the case, or at least not as fast as they led me to believe but i wound up loving it anyway. now that i'm ready to upgrade i want to do what i planned last time. i have read that win runs great on the new 'properly equped' macs so i just want to make sure i make the right choice this time.

7141	5	284780	2709734	2709721	jnsarra	2/20/08 2:20 pm	1.2035172e12	why didn't i think to go t youtube :)	duh, i'm embarassed i never considered that there would be video in action. i think the parallels on the mackbook (non-pro) w/ 2 gb ram running photoshop was all i needed to set my mind at ease that the 2.2 w/o the ram upgrade should be fine. now i just need to wait out the rumor of new mb pros coming out the end of feb. even though my initial question of what to buy has been answered i do still wonder which is better bang for the buck - ram vs processor upgrade...
