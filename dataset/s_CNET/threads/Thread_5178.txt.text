i have been reading many pages of the forum and it seems like everyone is having problems with the usb ext hard drives. i have a dell desktop, 512mb mem, 40 gb hard drive that is full, and win xp pro. just wondering if anyone has had any luck buying and using a usb ext hard drive on a system similar to mine. any answers appreciated. rogge
i've never had such a problem, but i know to put such on usb 2.0 ports and how to sort out bios, and motherboard/os drivers. bob
i have 5 of usb hard drives on my windows xp pro and never had a prob. with them.
