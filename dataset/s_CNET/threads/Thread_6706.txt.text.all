<s> i have a wireless modem/router downstairs and will be putting a desktop pc upstairs.  </s>
<s> i was wondering what would be better: a wireless access point or a wireless desktop card.  </s>
<s> i do have one free pci expansion slot for the card.  </s>
<s> however, i was wondering if one was better than the other when it comes to speed, coverage (distance from router), etc. anyone have any thoughts?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> to communicate with the router, without such no wireless connection is possible.  </s>
<s> a wap is used to add wireless capapbilities to an area.  </s>
<s> two different functions.  </s>
<s> ah, i understand.  </s>
<s> for some reason i thought a wap received a wireless signal (from, lets say another wireless item, like my router).  </s>
<s> i did not realize a wap actually creates (pushes) a wireless signal out from a wired network.  </s>
