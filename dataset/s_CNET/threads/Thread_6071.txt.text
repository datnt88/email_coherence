does anyone know of a resource which lists which cpus are compatible with an asus p4c800 deluxe motherboard? sadly, i couldn't find anything anywhere on the asus website, nor anywhere else on the subject.
why not start with  ? bob
mrhahn, asus's search feature can be at times difficult. attempted to find your board at the web site was not successful and had to back into the information thur dog pile. the link is here:  bill
