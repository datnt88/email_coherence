<s> i am installing windows xp pro on a two year old laptop that had windows xp home.  </s>
<s> i have found out that i bought the computer with a partitioned hard drive, one is primary, one is logical.  </s>
<s> i want to merge the two into the one whole and complete hard drive.  </s>
<s> i am staring from scratch, so none of the files are sacred.  </s>
<s> my xp disk does not give the option of merging and i can't afford the $100.00 for partition magic.  </s>
<s> are there other options for me out there?  </s>
<s> sony vio, 36 gb hd, 768 ram  </s>
<s> allow you to remove the partitions and reformat as one partition.  </s>
<s> are you certain that the other partition is not a partition used by the laptop mfr to store the op sys and all the drivers, and that your cd is actually a restore cd? proprietary systems normally do this, i.e. dell, compaq, gateway, etc.  </s>
<s> since this is laltop, you should have the orginal restore/recovcery cd if only for the &quot;drivers&quot; needed to make the os install more complete.  </s>
<s> if none or problematic, then going to the laptop makers support website for that model's drivers will be required.  </s>
<s> this process takes place after loading the os. ray, pretty covered the os install process, just load your xp pro cd and &quot;make sure the cd is 1st boot device in bios&quot;.  </s>
<s> once done, when prompted upon the hd format, make all space available for a &quot;c&quot; drive option or 1 partition.  </s>
<s> good luck tada -----willy  </s>
