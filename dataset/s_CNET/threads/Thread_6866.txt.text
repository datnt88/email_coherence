i have a maxtor one touch 200gb external hard drive that has given me some issues. i use it primarily on my laptop, a dell latitude d610. now, i started having problems when i tried to access certain folders in the drive. i would double-click them, and my computer (i sound like an idiot, but whatever you call the thing you browse your hard drive with) froze up. this happened repeatedly and consistently. i was told to run a disk check (chkdsk or whatever), and many sections were found to be 'unreadable.' finally, i formatted the entire hard drive, since i couldn't access anything on there anyway. now, at least from some initial testing, it seems to work fine. however, i barely have anything on it at the moment, so the problem could still be there. anyone know what is going on? i'm kind of a newb, so feel free to remind me if i've forgotten to include anything.
if so it's known to corrupt at times. here's a search about how to convert to a safer ntfs volume.  bob
alas, no, it is ntfs. =/
sorry but with so little clues i have to write the drive is dying or you don't backup your files. external hard disks are fine copies but not a backup! read this recent reply about free tools. -&gt;  bob
