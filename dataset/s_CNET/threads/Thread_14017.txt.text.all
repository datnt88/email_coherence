<s> i intend on installing it myself.  </s>
<s> ifixit has great instructions for this, which includes a guide for keeping the various screws you remove sorted by type and location.  </s>
<s> question that came to me was raised by someone else recently asking a similar question.  </s>
<s> do i need to worry about upgrading the firmware for this drive?  </s>
<s> how would i even determine what the firmware version is?  </s>
<s> if the firmware does need upgraded, do i do it before i reinstall the os? i've upgraded firmware in windows machines and digital cameras but this is my first hardware experience with a mac. the new hard drive is a toshiba mk1234gax 120gb ata-6 (i picked it from a list of hd's that ifixit gave as replacements they would install for my model ibook) the computer is an ibook 12&quot; 1.2 ghz g4 thanks for any info... grim  </s>
<s> i have never felt the urge to update the firmware on a hd so i would have no idea of how that would be accomplished.  </s>
<s> it is a topic that has never raised its head since i started to use any of apple's computers.  </s>
<s> wind it up and let it go.  </s>
<s> p  </s>
<s> because if you take a look at the power macs and pros, you'll notice that you just have to stick a drive in them and go.  </s>
<s> of course an ibook isn't the same, but same principle in a way... lol.  </s>
<s> i've never even heard of updating hd firmware for computers, but my pcs are from the pentium era, so there's not much to work with.  </s>
<s> i would think that once you install the system, the ibook will do everything it needs to for you.  </s>
<s> what hd are you upgrading from?  </s>
<s> my mbp has a 120gb hd, and i find it to be a tad small, though i haven't used up half of it... yet.  </s>
<s> surely it can go a bit bigger, but maybe 120gb is plenty for you.  </s>
<s> i have never owned an ibook but the g4 models are still pretty good, considering that a lot of the good ones were produced a little over two years ago.  </s>
<s> i've seen a friend's ibook and he just loves it.  </s>
<s> too bad he got it the day before the macbook came out lol .  </s>
<s> cheers.  </s>
<s> -bmf  </s>
<s> it was a reasonable price (around $77 us).  </s>
<s> it's a 5400 rpm drive.  </s>
<s> i thought about a faster drive but decided against it, in favor of longer battery life.  </s>
<s> i won't be using this computer for anything more than basic graphic design, and web design while on the go.  </s>
<s> if i need more room i also have a portable 120 gb usb drive.  </s>
<s> i will need to get a new apple sometime in the near future capable of decent speeds for video editing.  </s>
<s> times is pretty good, lol.  </s>
<s> well, enjoy.  </s>
