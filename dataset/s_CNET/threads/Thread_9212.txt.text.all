<s> i'm trying to find information on what printers are the most environmentally friendly.  </s>
<s> i bought an epson inkjet several years ago, and they say the cartridges aren't recyclable, but hp cartridges are.  </s>
<s> i'm also considering a laser printer, and want to know what the environmental issues are there too.  </s>
<s> but so far i haven't found any info on this on cnet.  </s>
<s> can someone help?  </s>
<s> hp may have the edge here.  </s>
<s> their program of laser cartridge return have been around for years.  </s>
<s> now they have implemented more avenues to return spent cartridges, printers and pcs back to hp for them to deal with.  </s>
<s> your discussion is not about ink refills.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> if you're in the usa, many a shop may have a &quot;return envelope&quot; w/free shipping to return *any* ink cart of any brand, provided it fits of course.  </s>
<s> as for laser toner empties, hp and others provide a return box or service for same to again return to hp or namebrand source.  </s>
<s> many office supply outlets accept ink or toner carts and may even provide an item in exchange.  </s>
<s> offcie max, give a ream of paper for orginal ink cart empty.  </s>
<s> also, ofiice or offic edeport accept computer items as thier drop-off points.  </s>
<s> ibm and hp i believe accept these as well when you buy a new system.  </s>
<s> so look around and/or go online and check for it.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> something else must get dirty.  </s>
<s> yours is a good question and deserves a lot of thought imho.  </s>
<s> but, one must keep things in perspective.  </s>
<s> when you recycle, it might just mean that you don't have to see the item in your own trash.  </s>
<s> as was mentioned in the other posts, there are recycling avenues.  </s>
<s> some schools and non-profit organizations have cartridge recycling programs which provide cash or goods for such items.  </s>
<s> you can research this.  </s>
<s> office supply centers allow you to drop off cartridges and then they sell their own brand of compatibles.  </s>
<s> hmmm, could your cartridge deposit be refilled and resold to you eventually?  </s>
<s> a bigger problem may be the printer itself.  </s>
<s> a cheap printer may have nearly as much bulk as a better one but last a shorter time.  </s>
<s> hence, more waste may be generated by these over time.  </s>
<s> again, some manufacturers have recycling programs for hardware and some of these are fee based.  </s>
<s> find out what happens to the printer once it's returned as sometimes these can be exchange &quot;come ons&quot; that allow you a discount on a new piece of hardware produced by that manufacturer.  </s>
<s> beware of one that offers a competitive trade in as these will take another manufacturers item as well.  </s>
<s> these may not get recycled but just dumped to get it out of circulation.  </s>
<s> now, to emphasize my opening remark...you can get injet refill kits.  </s>
<s> these might or might not work for you.  </s>
<s> you may be happy to get multiple uses from a cartridge before you toss it.  </s>
<s> some recyclers don't want refilled ones, however, and you still have the plastic refill kit to dispose of eventually.  </s>
<s> i'm not trying to talk you out of your &quot;earth friendly&quot; intentions.  </s>
<s> i applaud and we attempt such in our home.  </s>
<s> study and do it wisely as manufacturers have their businesses in mind first and, for some of them, waste improves their bottom line.  </s>
<s> great question!  </s>
