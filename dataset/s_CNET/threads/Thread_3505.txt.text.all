<s> is there any where to purchase the controler board for a maxtor maxline plus ii 250gb ata/133 drive.  </s>
<s> this is a backup drive which we fried.  </s>
<s> any used supply/parts vendors out there?  </s>
<s> thank you.das  </s>
<s> then remove the good board?  </s>
<s> i have seen faulty drives placed on ebay for such purposes.  </s>
<s> they tend to auction really cheap.  </s>
<s> you will stumble into ebay &quot;stores&quot; that have a lot of used and &quot;as is&quot; computer hardware.  </s>
<s> i never spent money to tinker with hard drives in such a manner, though.  </s>
<s> if you perform the operation, let us know how it goes.  </s>
<s> personally, i go for new drives.  </s>
<s> rebate specials on 250gb and larger drives for $70-$100 are more attractive to me. the warranty is nice, too.  </s>
