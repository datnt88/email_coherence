i want to update my video card in my computer. i have a dell demesion 4550 with a nvidia geforce 420 mx. i updated the ram to 2 gigs. what would be the best card to get for under $100?
you can use their product selector to see what agp card you can get for your budget. next stop is tomshardware.com and see if that card is on the vga charts. i must decline from perfoming this research for you. bob
if you're not into gaming, there's little difference between any video card. just go by price. for gaming, here are my suggestions. as usual, higher price = higher performance. all these cards will make you vista aero ready. $100 (after $15 rebate): radeon x1650pro 256mb,  $90: geforce 6600 256mb,  $42: geforce 6200a 128mb,
