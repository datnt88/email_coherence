sata150 only, not sata 2.5. pentium-d supported. i hope this is a repair/replacement part and not for a new build since this mobo is obsolete.
according to the mtrbd. support website this is what it supports:  if you don't find a match(specifications) for the support you need, then it doesn't support it. anytime you have a similar question like this the maker's support website is the definitive answer source. tada -----willy
duo, speed to 2.67ghz sata, 150mb/s (sata2 are backward compatible) but runs at lower speed.
