hi, i recently bought an acer aspire notebook. when i plugged a gadget in the usb drive (tried all 3 drives) it says that the usb drive is low-powered. i have tried a usb hub with a y-cable, a usb hub with external power and a usb 2.0 pcmcia card and it doesn't work. i checked and the usb port is 2.0. is there anything i can do to make it high-powered? can i change the usb controller? any advice greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.
question and make a suggestion: 1. what does acer have to say about this? 2. if it's not fixed then use the warranty and exchange it. and life goes on... jack
duh! acer support were the first people i turned to for help. they said there was nothing wrong with the machine and therefore, no exchange allowed. other techies i spoke to lectured me at length for wasting money on an acer.
finds that along with others, i've never seen that message. there are low speed messages and a power message but not a message as presented. sorry, but something is a little off here and it helps to use the same words as the message. bob
already contacted acer in your first post. you'd be surprised how many users haven't done that yet. bob's suggestion is a good one. and life goes on... jack
hi, i posted a reply yesterday but it appears to be lost in cyber space! the message when i plugged in the gadget was &quot;you have a low powered usb machine. please contact your technician for assistance&quot;. thanks in advance for any assistance you can give.
frankly i can only guess that some new programmer stuck it into a driver.  may want to hear about this since it's a new message. bob
thanks, bob. i think i'll just sell the darn machine, esp. since i have a buyer who is aware of the problem and for some strange reason, is still eager to buy the acer. my next machine will definitely not be an acer!
