i built my own pc a couple years ago, and i discovered recently that my on board usb slots are all usb 1.1 after i tried to transfer some pretty big files to a friends external hd and it took forever. i want to upgrade to usb 2.0 and mount it in one of my 5.25'' bays so they're in the front. i've priced usb 2.0 cards, but before i buy one, i want to make sure that it'll work right. does the motherboard need to support usb 2.0 for it to work at the higher speeds, or can i just buy a pci card and be done with it? thanks!
i've used all models from newegg.com, geeks.com and they all work in windows 2000/xp. i can't tell if other oses have support. as to the front panel, usb 2.0 wiring must be used. cheers, bob
if it is from a pci card, your motherboard will support it. you can find them that go from the pci card to the front 5.25&quot; bay and yes, it should support it.
i'm backing the last post up.....
