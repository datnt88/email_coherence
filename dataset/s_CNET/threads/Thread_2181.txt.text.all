<s> i'm upgrading the motherboard and cpu.  </s>
<s> my existing hard drive with winxp home should boot up when i'm done, right?  </s>
<s> or do i have to do something with bios?  </s>
<s> will the mobo homepage have the info i need?  </s>
<s> normally when you replace the motherboard, you have to reinstall windows.  </s>
<s> further, if what you have is the oem version of windows, you can't use it with a different configuration, so you'd have to buy a new windows license.  </s>
<s> before you do the replace, be certain that you've saved any data you don't want to lose.  </s>
<s> there's nothing you can do in the bios that will change this.  </s>
<s> sorry.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> probably work without a problem.  </s>
<s> if not...you'll probably have to reinstall fresh/clean.  </s>
<s> let us  </s>
