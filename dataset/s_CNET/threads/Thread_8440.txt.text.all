<s> i know, probably a weird question.  </s>
<s> but i'm wondering if i could possibly get another lcd monitor (like the philips 190b6cs/27 19&quot; with one usb port installed) and attach some sort of vga-to-bluetooth adapter or something.  </s>
<s> if i could spend under $500 ($400 monitor, &gt;$100 adapter/bluetooth module) and add a second workstation in my living room using my pc i'm currently building (athlon 64 x2 4400+ 2.2 ghz duals, 2 gb ram, 250 gb hd 16 mb buffer, 256 mb ram w/ sli support, windows xp either mce or professional)... that would be a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  </s>
<s> it would cost $500-ish and use my $2200 build, a $6500 computer when including software and peripherals.  </s>
<s> anybody know of a solution?  </s>
<s> i'm sure i can't be the only one who could appreciate this benefit.  </s>
<s> sure i realize it's still sharing one computer and two people can't use it at once (probably), and i imagine software can handle input options (like a kvm switch) so input shows on both monitors or only one according to which key/mouse is used.  </s>
<s> okay pdd's (product developers and designers) get cracking!  </s>
<s> i wanna be able to buy this product within 12 months if it doesn't already exist..  </s>
<s> there are wifi terminal type units out there but i leave it for you to hunt them down.  </s>
<s> cheers, bob  </s>
<s> i don't know if he understood what you want.  </s>
<s> i too want a monitor that can hookup via bluetooth.  </s>
<s> it's another laptop in the other room and i'd like to just grab it with kb, mouse, and monitor (a separate one, not the 2nd laptop).  </s>
<s> i alread have the kb and mouse so i'd hate to buy some wifi terminal.  </s>
<s> that would present other probs.  </s>
<s> i know you can get pc anywhere or the like, but i want the 2 comps isolated due to the pileup of spyware and viruses this one gets due to my &quot;surfing habits&quot; so, i wanna too, does it exist?  </s>
<s> with just the kb, mouse and monitor there will be some other hardware to get it to connect up.  </s>
<s> bluetooth is not an option past 32 feet (yes there are 100 foot devices) and the paltry speed will have us waiting for a screen to show up (figure seconds for each video frame change.) bluetooth is not the answer.  </s>
