i cannot believe i am having this much trouble finding a laser printer that prints on 80 lbs (216 gsm) coverstock that is 3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot; - typical 4bar or a1 flat card size. why is this not something that laser printers can do? again, i want to be able to print on an a1 flat card size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm). anyone have any ideas?? thanks for your help!
for example finds prior discussions. you can hit hp.com and it's chat button among other makers to ask directly. bob
that's why i am asking here. the key to this question is the size of the paper (a1/4bar/3 1/2&quot;x4 7/8&quot;) and the thickness of 80# or 216gsm. i have been on the phone/online chat with hp, xerox and dell and seems most of the people answering the phones cannot understand what 3.5&quot; wide means, let alone 4 7/8&quot; in height. does anyone know of a laser printer that can print on an a1 flat card (3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot;) size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm). thanks!
i read  and see this. &quot; postcard, 3 x 5 in, 4 x 6 in&quot; so while it hit your weight of the paper it missed the 5 inch side by 1/8 inch. it appears nothing does this. bob
this appears to be something your print shops produce. i think they would consider a printer like this one.  bob
now you see the reason for the post, bob? actually most smaller print shops buy the 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cardstock (80#) paper, print and then have it cut to size. all printers i have seen say they can handle custom sizes from width of 3&quot; to 8.5&quot; and height of 5&quot; to 14&quot;, which means they are all short by 1/8th inch in height. why the hell a manufacturer wouldn't make a printer that accepts a1 flat card size is beyond me. since it is a standard and not much of a difference. geez. thanks for the info on the fladbed printers, but i am not paying $10k for a printer. so the question is still there: does anyone know of a laser printer that can print on an a1 flat card (3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot;) size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm)??
and let's be honest. we have for years exceeded the specs on paper weight on many printers. sure the warranty is not going to be honored but you smile as you put your 120lb stock through the straight path and it works. it's possible that that printer will work with the 1/8 inch shy stock but are you running into folk that demand it be in the specs and not go with what may work? and yes, this is why we had a sheer in the print shop. print it on a stock size then cut to size. it's been an amazing journey as i see folk that wonder how we got edge to edge printing on such stock. we never did. we printed then put it in the sheer cutter. bob
you need to visit the vendor websites and check the specs. i suspect you went to the common ones, but overall if you want cheap or basic home office, once you get out of the norm, they won't carry it. this is where i suggest you find commercial application laser that will be more expensive but they do the job. i don;t know the final costs but going to local staples, or best buy, etc., aren't always helpful for specifics at times. you can check with a local business and see what they offer like business copy and printer sellers. at least they have catalogs or sales people that could help. konica, canon, ricoh and sharp are big suppliers for business, so don't be surprised no hp or dell or common brands. you can check out &quot;refurbed units&quot; to help reduce costs or commercial trade papers or online sources. also, i'm sure what you want should be in &quot;flat stock&quot; path printing too, heavy media doesn't bend well plus is a demanding media to print on. any cheap laser may print ok but movement of media maybe a problem over time. tada -----willy
