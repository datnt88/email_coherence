i am looking to run two seagate 250gb 7200 16mb ultra ata hard drives with a raid-0 configuration and am looking for some ideas for what computer to run these on. i'll be capturing images off of 8mm tape and need something fast enough to keep up with the process. any help would be appreciated.
my old 120gb 7200 rpm drive does just fine either by firewire or analog capture. why would i need raid 0? bob
new 7200rpm drives have sustained transfer rates in excess of 40mb/sec. unless you have video segments that exceed 250gb in a single file, dual striped 250gbs is a bit overkill.
