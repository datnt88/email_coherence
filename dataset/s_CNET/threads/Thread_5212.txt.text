i've watched half of my new &quot;willy wonka and the chocolate factory&quot; on my home computer, which sports a pioneer bdc-202 blu-ray player. now, however, i can read and write other disks, but the 202 has stopped recognizing blu-ray disks altogether! the only updates i've made are microsoft's -- updates i've grown increasingly wary of -- and i'm wondering if it could be the updates that are creating this problem! not only will my powerdvd 8 not see it, neither can i get my system to see any content. indeed, it thinks there is no disk there. does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening? i can't believe it's a hardware problem, but who knows? thanks! john
that tells me it's unlikely a software problem. but try reinstall the software anyway; it can't hurt. of course hardware do fail sometime but hopefully this is not the case. good luck.
thanks, but there's no software i can retry. i go to the dvd drive icon and click on it, and it doesn't see any disk. yet if i put a standard dvd into it, it will read it just fine.
a bd-rom drive can be had for about $50 now. as for why dvd works but not bd, my understand is that there 2 different scanning laser (1 for dvd and 1 for bd).
strange, but i popped in my stargate blu-ray disc today and it plays fine. willy wonka used to play fine, too, but now my system can't see the disk. why would it see other blu-ray discs, but not a disc that had played once with ease? if i can't get a workable answer, i'll have to buy a fifty dollar lg disc player.
go to the store and get another one.
