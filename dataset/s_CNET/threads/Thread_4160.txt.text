i am wondering if i should swich over to mozerilla firefox from ie. i have heard a bunch of good about it, just wondering what everyones opinion on it was. does it get junky, all the upgrades and stuff?
seeing as ie is the main target for virus and spyware writers, i only use ie for windows updates, or any of those web sites that still only use ie proprietary html that doesn't always work in other browsers. why not try firefox? if you like it you will stay with it. if not, you can always uninstall it. mark
mozilla firefox has become my workhorse browser. lots of add-ons for whatever you need. as many others do for security reasons, i only use ie for windows updates, code testing, and those sites that require ie. ciao.
i use it and prefer it. for some strange reason ie &quot;hangs up&quot; and i usually have to exit and re-enter the program, i don't have this problem with firefox...that's why i prefer it. like others have said...why not try it?...you can always un-install it if you don't like it. occasionally (rarely is more accurate) a website will require ie ...i simply close the firefox browser and fire up the ie (hoping it doesn't freeze up).
