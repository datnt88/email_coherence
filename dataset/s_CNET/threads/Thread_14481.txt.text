about 18 months ago (i lost a year being in iraq) my windows xp me home os crashed on my laptop. i got a new hd (since sony has no recover program other than wiping the whole hd) reloaded the drivers and os and then tried to access my old hd using a stand alone sata portable hd case (rocketfish). problem: i can see the folders, and even access down a level but when i tried to open/copy/move a folder/file it locks up. i had tried copying through the cmd.exe interface and it can list the directories, but when you ask it to copy it states it can't find it. does anyone know how i can get data off my old hd? thanks in advance! matt
google xp take ownership if you forgot how.
as soon as i click on something it just locks up - i have another hd from an old computer that i have to take ownership of - that's just no the case for this hd. i do think it may have something to do with the registry - the program from ms that addresses &quot;file not found&quot; registry errors cannot be selected for an external hd which this is - any suggestions? thanks in advanced- matt

have you tried another pc and check results? if you can, try ubuntu live linux version and see if you can copy that way or burn to disc. tada ------willy
