<s> imac/0s x 10.6.1/2.66 ghz core 2 duo/4gb 1067mhz ddr3/640gb hd/ for about 2 months my epson cx5200 always prints regular horizontal red lines on every sheet of paper, spaced at 1/2 inch vertical intervals.  </s>
<s> the horizontal length of these red lines varies, and is equal to the horizontal length of the printed matter on the page.  </s>
<s> (ditto in landscape orientation, with the red lines vertical) the red line problem shows up in all cases, even when printing in grayscale.  </s>
<s> nozzle checks are clean and correct (except for the extra red lines) i've changed the magenta printer cartridge.  </s>
<s> all cartridges are epson oem.  </s>
<s> i've downloaded the latest epson drivers for os 10.6  </s>
<s> understand, for epsons when changing the ink carts changes just that, &quot;ink cart&quot; not the inkjet printhead.  </s>
<s> which is why when a epson has problems it usually relates to the prthd.. in such cases, doing a cleaning of several times is required.  </s>
<s> your test results are not good if you have red lines appearing.  </s>
<s> that also suggests you got a blown ink jet itself or a bad control/ic for that particular inkjet.  </s>
<s> this is not a end user fixable(unless you're capable&quot; buy the parts, yada, yada and fix it.  </s>
<s> however, for that cost you can buy another one(replacement ptr.).  </s>
<s> further, if you have any warranty, use it.  </s>
<s> i leave out any possible s/w glitch but i would think that epson support offer in faq, a link to a fix.  </s>
<s> of course, if you haven't query them for more.  </s>
<s> as it is, i don't know of this problem as s/w related, but again mac systems are different.  </s>
<s> yada -----willy  </s>
