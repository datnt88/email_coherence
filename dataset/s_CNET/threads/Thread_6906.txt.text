i am in the process of building my self a semi-future proof system, and i am just curious as to what component would create the most of a bottleneck compared to the other components: p4 640 64-bit 3.2 ghz 1 gig ddr2 533 raid 0 sata pair of 80 gigs all-in-wonder x600 pro hyundai l90d+ 19&quot; lcd 52x cd rom 48x (?) cd-rw
unless the cdrw and cdrom units are recycled, i'd just move to dvdrw... bob
well, i had started on this build initially more than a year ago when i got the case and the drives, so they are pretty aged. i will keep those in mind for the next upgrade when the cash starts flowing. thanks.
since you said that you got the case a year ago, does it have a psu and what size is it?? it should be a 450w min. john
yep, 450 watt
i would go with a better video card if possible...maybe the nvidia 6800 or ati 9800 pro
the x600 is a better performing card than the previous generation 9800. however, an x800...
what about cd authoring for listening away from the computer? it's trifficly popular. faldown
