what is the best graphics card i can get for 100? or possibly 150?
give the forum a list of what you can buy in your price range. not all the cards i can get, will be in your market at the price you might expect it to be. example, a 99u$d card may be double the exchange rate in you local market. next look to the vgacharts at  to see how your list fared. bob
it's a toss up between an ati 9600 xt for around 100 or at a stretch (money-wise) an nvidia 6600gt agp for around 150
seems to note the r4xx ati chips to be the competitor to the 6600gt. a very nice card. compare with  to see if benchmarks help you decide. both cards should be fine for most games. bob
