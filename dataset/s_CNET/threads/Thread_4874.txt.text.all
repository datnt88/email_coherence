<s> i have a wireless router in my office that i primarily use for just my laptop.  </s>
<s> i am getting a few toys in my living room, however, that need an internet connection (xbox, tivo, etc.) i am living in an apartment, so i can't just install networking jacks in the walls.  </s>
<s> i would also like to avoid having to buy wireless adapters for each component.  </s>
<s> is there some sort of wireless adapter that will pick up the wireless signal and route it to different ports (so each component would just hardwire into one box that would receive the wireless signal)?  </s>
<s> basically, it would look like a wireless router, just function in the opposite way.  </s>
<s> or can this actually be done with just a router?  </s>
<s> forgive my ignorance.  </s>
<s> please help if you are knowledgable.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> questions are best handled by those that have done so.  </s>
<s> for tivo, take a look here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for xbox try this &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  </s>
<s> thanks for the help, but i know how to google.  </s>
<s> i am trying to figure out if there is a particular product that i have described in the original forum. the products that i want to network are not important.  </s>
