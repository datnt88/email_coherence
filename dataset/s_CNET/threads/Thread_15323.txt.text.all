<s> my motherboard died in my (e machines t6420) 4 days out of the 1 year warranty, and my brother's did the same in his t6420 just within the warranty.  </s>
<s> 1. is there any way to find out if these boards are commonly defective, as 1 year seems ridiculous?  </s>
<s> 2. do i have any recourse?  </s>
<s> who's the right person to complain to besides the tech dept which diagnosed the problem?  </s>
<s> 3. any suggestions for a good quality upgrade motherboard if i'm stuck with the repair?  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> i see them to be under 99 bucks (most) at newegg.com and geeks.com.  </s>
<s> so while this failure may seem spooky at first i run into blown usb and keyboard ports during winter (north of the equator) due to electro static discharges or other reasons.  </s>
<s> one of the downsides of not maintaining your own machine will be paying about 300 or so for a repair.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> at a minimum, give emachines a call.  </s>
<s> explain the problem and they may get you a new motherboard.  </s>
<s> it's worth a shot.  </s>
<s> if you must replace the motherboard, you can get info on your current t6420 motherboard here:  </s>
<s> e-machines conveniently lists only a $20 tech support line, and after many e-mail correspondances with support, they still would not give out a (customer service number).  </s>
<s> so basically they just hope you'll go away!  </s>
<s> unless any one has a better way to get their attention, it looks like i will have to get a motherboard.  </s>
<s> are their any brands which stand out over the rest, and would upgrading to a faster speed comb.  </s>
<s> board be a difficult transition?  </s>
<s> fyi, my 13 month old e machine t6420 motherboard just died.  </s>
<s> also, fyi, my e machine notebook died last year after being only 18 months old.  </s>
<s> i don't think it would be smart to buy another e machine....nor to repair an existing e machine.  </s>
<s> since 1985 i've had desktops and notebooks from toshiba, compaq, hp, e machine, ibm, sony, etc...and has always been the cheapest price but has always died on me.  </s>
<s> all the other computers just got obsolete.  </s>
<s> motherboard in my *14* month-old emachine t6420 just died.  </s>
<s> wish i'd seen these posts last year when i was considering which box to buy .  </s>
<s> . .  </s>
<s> all my research indicated emachines were pretty big bang for the buck .  </s>
<s> . .  </s>
<s> guess you get what you pay for.  </s>
<s> i have an emachine t6412 and the motherboard died 1 day before the end of the warranty, we took it to best buy who sent it to emachines and they gladly replaced it.  </s>
<s> thanks for all your responses.  </s>
<s> i had the computer repaired finally this week, no thanks to e machines. the place that repaired it contacted e machines and after talking with several people and calling different numbers to get a replacement board, the representative said if i had contacted them within a week or two after the warranty and asked for a supervisor they would have repaired it under warranty.  </s>
<s> what a crock!  </s>
<s> i repeatedly asked for a supervisor during several online chat sessions with their technicians and they never once connected me with a supervisor, nor would they give me a number to call to speak with a representative.  </s>
<s> i saved all those frustrating e-mails.  </s>
<s> it appears many users had the same problem and guess what, that motherboard is not available.  </s>
<s> my next computer will not be an e machines/gateway.  </s>
<s> brad  </s>
<s> dear friend, i operate a computer consulting and repair business in michigan.  </s>
<s> i have only ever had to replace motherboards (this entire year) in the very same brand and model of computer you made reference to.  </s>
<s> i've spoken with other repair personnel in this area and we've discovered it to be the e-machine case that causes the motherboardss to fail.  </s>
<s> there was one customer who'd replaced his motherboard twice before finally replacing everything except the case.  </s>
<s> on his third go-round, his motherboard again shorted and failed after a while.  </s>
<s> as near as we can tell... the stamped hold-down holes in the e-machine case have a larger surface area than your conventional hexagonal screwin hold-downs, which we feel is the primary culprit of the unprecedented e-machine failure rate.  </s>
<s> i to, have a t6420 which lasted a whole 18 months before its untimely demise.  </s>
<s> such a long life.  </s>
<s> called e-machines at there non toll free number ( 408-273-0888),thank god for nationwide cell plans, and vented on them.  </s>
<s> did no good of course, but i feel a little better.  </s>
<s> i guess i'm going to strip the e-machine of all the drives, most of which were upgrades i installed, and buy a new quality case, motherboard, and cpu and install my drives and boards in it.  </s>
<s> one things sure, i'll never go near a e-machine or gateway again.  </s>
<s> i also want to add that two (2) emachine model t6420 computers purchased just over one year ago have also failed for myself and my mother.  </s>
<s> problem appeared to be bad power supplies at first, replaced and appeared to fix the problem, but then the video output went out on one followed by non-booting.  </s>
<s> second computer also failed without being able to power up the system, psu replacement did not correct the problem. the co-incident that both computers failed within the sametime frame (and just out of warrenty) leads me to believe that gateway/emachines have sold defective products.  </s>
<s> i am bringing this to the attention of an attorney and will inquire as to whether this should provide grounds for a class action law suit against these people.  </s>
<s> anyone else interested if we move forward with such a lawsuit???  </s>
<s> i also have an emachine t6420 that died just shy of two years.  </s>
<s> very frustrating.  </s>
<s> i contacted gateway and the tech agreed that emachines is not a good product and they are replacing them.  </s>
<s> it sounds as if emachines was selling defective computers.  </s>
<s> let me know if this turns into a class action suit.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i've had my t6420 about 2 years now, only problem i've had was to replace the hard drive about 3 months ago.  </s>
<s> not happy about that!  </s>
<s> would love to know about any lawsuits.  </s>
<s> i have had my emachines t6420 for almost exectly 24 months.  </s>
<s> motherboard is having problems.  </s>
<s> i can't restart and usb mouse drops out all the time.  </s>
<s> also video jumping around.  </s>
<s> a friend of mine who owns a computer support business did a remote on my machine and thinks a bad capacitor on the motherboard is the culprit.  </s>
<s> he says this is common in emachines and dell optiplex.  </s>
<s> emachines support is completely useless.  </s>
<s> what a bunch of total idiodts.  </s>
<s> their answer to everything is to do a full system restore.  </s>
<s> i have no doubt they knew of ms-7207 motherboard problems long ago and continued to sell these crappo units.  </s>
<s> anyway, here is my question.  </s>
<s> i am going to replace my ms-7207 motherboard but i have noticed that it comes in two versions.  </s>
<s> one with the nvidea geforce 6100 chipset and the other version with the nvidea geforce 6150 chipset.  </s>
<s> does anyone know if the 6150 chipset motherboard is compatible in the t6420?  </s>
<s> in other words would it operate on the same drivers and bios and would i be able to use the same restore disk?  </s>
<s> if yes then i intend to get this board instead of the original because it offers dvi out connections for monitor.  </s>
<s> thanks, strat100  </s>
<s> the xp os will want to re-activate and won't since it's another motherboard.  </s>
<s> you learn this after a few forays into the swamp.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> can you ellaborate?  </s>
<s> are you saying that i have no options here.  </s>
<s> that even replacing the motherboard won't help me because the the restore disk won't work on a new motherboard?  </s>
<s> i'm lost on that one.  </s>
<s> i thought i would be ok if i just took the old processor and memory off of my old motherboard and put it on a new motherboard?  </s>
<s> my computer is working right now it just has problems and i want to replace the motherboard.  </s>
<s> i would like to use the 6150 chipset but it's not crucial.  </s>
<s> i have no problem using the stock motherboard that came in it.  </s>
<s> sounds as if you have fallen into this swamp yourself?  </s>
<s> strat100  </s>
<s> how windows detects changes in the hardware.  </s>
<s> also the supplied os is often locked to the system as supplied.  </s>
<s> i only note this so you won't be totally surprised about not only having to install a few drivers but having to get a xp license as well.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i see what you are saying now.  </s>
<s> emachines is really a racket.  </s>
<s> i will never buy another thats for sure.  </s>
<s> they are the worst company i have ever dealt with.  </s>
<s> what cheap crap they sell.  </s>
<s> anyway, there is no way i am going to pay them $160.00 for a motherboard and then still have to jump through hoops to get it all to work.  </s>
<s> my plan at this point is to scrap everything but the case, hard drive, and media reader.  </s>
<s> i think i will find a deal on a motherboard/cpu bundle, power supply, and a new liscensed xp. i don't know what other choice i really have right now.  </s>
<s> i undestand the tower case is pretty generic and should fit most components.  </s>
<s> is this your understanding as well?  </s>
<s> thanks, strat100  </s>
<s> that is, their written agreement that i will be avoiding the 99 to 199 dollar price tag and bill for windows... -&gt; emachines has no corner on the market on this issue.  </s>
<s> just about every retail machine will not run the supplied windows if you change the motherboard.  </s>
<s> look up hp and the word &quot;tattoo my motherboard.&quot;  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i've replaced motherboards numerous times on e-machines, sometimes with the same make and model, other times with newer or different models.  </s>
<s> though i don't use a &quot;restore disk&quot; per say, i've never had any problems reloading windows xp and using the existing license key that is affixed to the side of the e-machine.  </s>
<s> at the time you need to &quot;activate&quot; your operating system, you will notice an option to change the key.  </s>
<s> if you choose that option, you can enter your actual key and click generate id. with this new id, you'll be able to authenticate with windows.  </s>
<s> if not, call them, it takes about 6 minutes, they don't give you any problems and you'll be activated before you hang up.  </s>
<s> my emachine died on friday.  </s>
<s> came home and tried to power it up and got nothing.  </s>
<s> at first i thought it may be the hd, but soon discovered it wasn't.  </s>
<s> i can at least get all my data off the hd before i wipe it completely.  </s>
<s> i rebuild computers a lot and i've never had an issue with activating an os. it's all automated, unless something goes haywire on their end.  </s>
<s> then, you just read the numbers and they repeat a different set back, you enter them and your done.  </s>
<s> i replaced my motherboard last week on my emachines t6420.  </s>
<s> replaced it with a biostar geforce 6100-m9.  </s>
<s> boot up went smoothly.  </s>
<s> for revalidation for windows xp i ended up having to call windows but once i did it went smoothly and had no problems.  </s>
<s> so far motherboard is operating just fine and i didn't lose any previous info or have to do a restore or anything.  </s>
<s> i am having one small problem though.  </s>
<s> my cpu fan and system (case) fan are running fast all the time.  </s>
<s> my cpu temperature seems ok and is normally running at a bout 24 degrees celsius and under gaming conditions at about 34 c so it does not seem to be a heat problem.  </s>
<s> i did add a little heat sink compund back to the top of the cpu where it meets the heat sink when i did the install so i know it is transfering heat ok. this seems to be more a problem with the fans not beiung sensed.  </s>
<s> i have checked my bios and have everything set correctly there.  </s>
<s> have cool-n-quiet set to auto and my power options in windows set to minimum power management.  </s>
<s> not sure what the problem is but it is annoying with the fans running fast all the time.  </s>
<s> loud.  </s>
<s> anyone else encountered this problem?  </s>
<s> strat 100  </s>
<s> i purchased an emachine t3092 from circuit city in paducah kentucky.  </s>
<s> the capacitors on the motherboard have leaked battery acid which has eaten the traces and done other damage to materials inside of the case.  </s>
<s> if you are having any trouble with emachine and would like to have all of your money refunded to you by means of a class-action lawsuit (nothing is necessary on your behalf unless otherwise specified) please email me at polachelliot@aol.com thank you for your time elliot polach  </s>
<s> i bought this machine in march 2006.. it is now in the shop for the 3rd time.. 2 times to replace the motherboard.. (these two times were within about 4 months time... this time they say is most likely the motherboard but i haven't gotten it back so not sure what will be done.  </s>
<s> email me at yorkiepaws@msn.com if i can be included in a class action suit.. thanks, elizabeth  </s>
<s> i was wondering if this class-action lawsuit was still coming up or if it had already been settled.  </s>
<s> i bought my emachine t6420 in dec.  </s>
<s> 07 for around $700 or so if i remember correctly and had to replace the motherboard in jan.  </s>
<s> 08 for another $160.  </s>
<s> just recently i tried to upgrade the video card so i bought a pciexpress card, but the motherboard doesn't seem to see it there. the one time that it did see it, the computer froze during the windows loading screen.  </s>
<s> i am definately down for getting my money back for a machine that has seemed to cause problems for just about everyone who has owned one.  </s>
<s> please let me know what is/has happened with this lawsuit.  </s>
<s> thank you jon plouffy_69_01@yahoo.com  </s>
