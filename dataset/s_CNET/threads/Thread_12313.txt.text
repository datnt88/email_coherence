can someone help me on this i have a emachine computer and i had the monitor plug pulled out of the back of the computer now i can't use the monitor anymore , i tryed to put it back in but forget that. so is there a usb plug that can be connected to the monitor and the computer, or do i have t get a whole new mother board. richard
the cables are specific to the monitor in question. in other words, they're not that generic. you still hadn't explain your problem does the monitor work? have you tried anything yet? is the monitor cable at the monitor side or at the video port? if not, you maybe able to return cable provide no real physical damage is done, just loose. otherwise, disassemble the back cover and see what's what, again only if you're capable. get back. tada -----willy
yes the montior does work , my son did not unscrew the video connector plug he puled it out and the who;e thing came out of the monther board in the back or can i get another video card and install that will it work. richard
so what you are saying is, the monitor port &quot;where the cable plugs into&quot; was yanked off the motherboard. fortunately, you can buy a graphics card or basic monitor card and put one in. however, i won't say there wasn't any damage to the motherboard itself further than where the port got yanked from but if you are lucky, there isn't. paul
if the video port is ashew then yes you can replace it. you will need to &quot;disable&quot; the build-in mtrbd. video and install a new video card. the new card should contain instructions for all this or at its support website. place electrical tape to prevent the video port from moving to possibility cause a short or whatever, just keep it from moving. tada -----willy
thank you all for the info , i will get a new card, i was not sure about that.now i no i can do that thanks again all richard
