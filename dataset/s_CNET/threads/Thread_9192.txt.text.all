<s> this summer, i bought an inspiron 6000 from dell. it has 512 ram and a 64 mb graphics card.  </s>
<s> i was wondering, can i get a graphics card if i need to sometime in the future?  </s>
<s> i am fairly confident that your motherboard will not take a new gpu.  </s>
<s> i'm sorry.  </s>
<s> few laptops can have an upgraded gpu.  </s>
<s> could your run belarc advisor for me to make sure?  </s>
<s> maybe you can... look under video adapters.  </s>
<s> does it say anything about pci-e or agp or something?  </s>
<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>
<s> if you can, dell would know and have the right video card.  </s>
<s> i didn't see anything like that, and i searched the page for pci-e and agp but nothing came up.  </s>
<s> how do i find out?  </s>
<s> there was an option of a bigger 128 mb card, but i didn't go for it when i bought the machine.  </s>
<s> not all laptops have upgradable cards.  </s>
<s> dell should tell you with just one call.  </s>
