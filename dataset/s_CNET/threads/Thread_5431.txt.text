which do you guys think would be a good blu ray player to purchase? any good recommendations would be appreciated. thanks.
seems fine here. sorry, the old one not that new one.
i didn't quite understand what you said... any problems?
i'm not sure what you didn't understand.
blu-ray drive. is that correct? not a standalone bp.
let me share an annoying issue with many blu-ray drive purchases. many fall for the cheap bare drive buy without bluray player software. today i don't find such for free and if you don't get it with the drive the added cost vaporises your wallet (err, savings.) hope that helps. bob
@ lee koo no, it's a blu ray player.. i'm tossing over of just using ps3 instead of buying a stand alone blu ray player but some guys here said that it isn't a &quot;smart&quot; thing to do. i think i'll agree. @ bob thanks for the tip. regarding before, i thought you had any problems with my question. you said &quot;seems fine here&quot;, i thought i did something terrible. haha . i'll continue searching first.. it isn't that urgent.
