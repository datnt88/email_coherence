hello, i just burned a dvd (with a bunch of pictures) on my pc, then put the dvd into my mac g4. mac won't open it. it won't recognize it. then i put another dvd with some files on it, also burned on my pc. same thing. when i put a picture cd (from ritz camera) it opens it just fine. when i put a dvd movie it opens it fine. is it possible that this problem comes from the fact that these dvds were burned on the pc? thanks a lot! exp.
you'll want to stick with mac's preferred (i hope i remember this correctly) dvd-r or you may see this instant issue.  many pcs came with only dvd+r/w recorders and you get instant headaches. next, the format of the data on the drive matters. bob
hi bob, my pc's dvd is 16x dl dvdrw, while my mac's is just a regular cd-rom/dvd-rom. the data is a bunch of .jpg pictures, nothing more. and the media i used is actually dvd+r, so that may be the problem. i'll get some dvd-r media and try it again. thanks for your help. cheers, exp.
