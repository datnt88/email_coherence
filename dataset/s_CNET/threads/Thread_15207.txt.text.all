<s> my venerable old dell xps gen 3 gaming rig at my secondary residence finally gave up the ghost.  </s>
<s> i was looking for a replacement.  </s>
<s> i have had problems in the past with 2 gaming machines that i had bought for my son....namely a dell and then an alienware that were doa right out of the box with much subsequent difficulty getting customer service to rectify the situation(s).  </s>
<s> i have a velocity micro at my primary residence which i paid a fortune for and this one never performed close to what was advertised and was very unstable until i upgraded it to windows 7. so being a little gun shy about those 3 companies i decided to try hp. i ordered a hpe-180e with a 3.33ghz i7 processor, 12 mb ram, a 1 tb hd, and a very high end ati graphics card.  </s>
<s> well my steak continues as this thing was a hog right out of the box, could not connect to the internet wirelessly at all, and the sound card made honking noises every time i played a game.  </s>
<s> now i was on the phone with the idiots from hp all day yesterday who can't fix it.  </s>
<s> they are all telling me i can return it for a full refund.  </s>
<s> i've been calling them back and no one at hp seems to know how to make this happen.  </s>
<s> anyway, they will refund me even if i have to get amex involved, but in the meantime i still need a new gaming rig.  </s>
<s> i need stable and i need reasonable/good performance for non-on-line gaming.  </s>
<s> so i need suggestions...please???  </s>
<s> gamer machines are still tending to be finicky machines.  </s>
<s> after decades of watching all this and helping friends and more, the goal of a stable gamer machine looks to be a lost cause.  </s>
<s> however i've taken simple machines and popped in better graphics cards and all is fine.  </s>
<s> but then again i might have the advantage of be an electronics designer, writing code from before the days of the ge 210 and now writing windows mobile apps.  </s>
<s> i wonder how average joe is supposed to get a gamer machine.  </s>
<s> maybe a xbox 360 or ps3 is the best solution?  </s>
<s> about the wifi.  </s>
<s> i've lost count how many times i've fixed such.  </s>
<s> all i can comment on there is the way we got wifi means that there is no standard and it is not consumer friendly.  </s>
<s> if we could do it all over again one of the rules to market would be &quot;it should just work.&quot;  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> alot on what you want specifically, and what your budget is.  </s>
<s> if you're tired of the 'out-of-the-box' types of rigs, then there are scours of manufacturers out there that only build 'gaming pc's'.  </s>
<s> when i googled 'buy a gaming pc' this is just a few of the hits i came up with:  </s>
<s> of the 4 pc's i have mentioned all were custom designed and ordered from each manufacturers respective website and not store bought or out of the box.  </s>
<s> at the time i ordered the velocity and the alienware machines they were primarily only doing high end gaming rigs.  </s>
<s> as i said the alienware was doa and they gave us such a hard time about a return that i would never do business with them again.  </s>
<s> the velocity did &quot;work&quot; as did the &quot;hp&quot; i'm sending back now, but they ran at nowhere near the promised blazing speed that i think i have the right to expect from machines that cost so much money. the velocity was pretty terrible until i upgraded to windows 7. for the high price paid, i want quality, speed, performance and reliability.  </s>
<s> it's like a car.  </s>
<s> if i buy and pay for a bmw then i have a right to expect not not to drive like a chevy.  </s>
<s> my primary question...still not answered is this: what brand of gaming pc do the people on this thread have and/or recommend?  </s>
<s> it's a simple machine.  </s>
<s> i found a nice enough hp d4999t and to keep things quiet i installed a zotac nvidia gt 240 1gb video card which is fanless.  </s>
<s> this runs some intel quad core, 4gb ram and windows 7 pro.  </s>
<s> what was interesting was its speed was below par too at first.  </s>
<s> later i found out by chance when cdburnerxp didn't work on it (it emitted an error message) that with a little google gave me the clue to install some intel storage manager item.  </s>
<s> now it's very nice.  </s>
<s> i don't expect makers to do this for us today.  </s>
<s> we are pretty much on our own but with super tools like search engines to figure it out.  </s>
<s> i know many think that it shouldn't be that way.  </s>
<s> for those i kindly and without any offense intended ask them to go try an apple.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> it's a matter of personal choice and what we use them for; some will buy an off-the-shelf, then add to them (such as what bob has done with his hp).  </s>
<s> others; like myself, have opted to build our own pc's.  </s>
<s> another way you can try is this  </s>
<s> check out the hp 190t, with the six core gullftown cpu!  </s>
<s> i just got an hp and it was dead right out of the box.  </s>
<s> took me 6 phone sessions with their tech support morons just to convince them it was defective.  </s>
<s> then 4 more calls just to get them to take the thing back.  </s>
<s> that's why i posted on this forum to begin with.  </s>
<s> hp again?  </s>
<s> i don't think so!!  </s>
