there is a computer at my job with building automation software on it, uses an sql database. the software recommends a 512 graphics card. the computer has a monitor but we don't use it that way. we all connect to it via remote desktop. does the that computer benefit having a graphics card? or do only the computers remoting in need a graphics card?
the pc that has the monitor connected should have the graphic card. kees
how does that computers graphics card help the remote user?
if the server is just storing the exe-file, and it's run on the client pc, the client pc should have the graphics card. if it's a terminal server, remote desktop or citrix setup (using a thin client), it most likely is a server thing also. then better ask the guy who manages the server. kees
is that i've written apps that log events and more to the sql database and with rare exception you can't use what is known as a headless server for some systems because they used windows. i don't want to duplicate all that has been written about headless servers but your product's maker must tell you if it can be done. keep in mine that i've done such but the costs are higher than if i went with a plain old pc with a card. bob
