6197	7	597406	5478503	5478494	r. proffitt	7/18/13 4:00 pm	1.3741632e12	link, comment (i see 8)	seems to show 6 classic sata ports and 2 more for a raid controller. 10 usb ports each with their own fuse and well, seems like a nice board. when folk build pcs my advice is to steal a published design from the web (tom's hardware, etc.) as they have usually done the hard thinking about power and more. bob
6197	8	597406	5478620	5478511	willy	7/19/13 5:44 am	1.37421264e12	the big boys	considering what you plan to do, you're already into the top end of pcs. whether you like it or not, i suspect having a &quot;work station&quot; type pc would best suit you. as for more than 6 sata ports, if you need more i don't think there are many mtrbds. out there that go beyond that as i typically see. again a work station being something of a mack truck configuration is more capable and do-able for grunt tasks as it were. it just gets the job done and depending on the cpu all the better. while having the most multiple-core will do fine, can the s/w use it? even, if the s/w can't use *all* of them it will try to use what its capable of, so it still not a waste. google for workstation configs and see what's out there and build similar or buy one. remember, cheap is cheap so will results be if you lean too much on cost factors. what you plan to do is certainly going to task a pc, so buying top shelf parts will be a plus. if storage seems to be a concern because of the sata needs, maybe look into nas or separate storage array setup, like in a raid server(guessing here). tada -----willy
6197	9	597406	5479052	5478620	the ancient one	7/20/13 3:40 pm	1.3743348e12	re: the big boys	thanks for all of the great information. i always look forward to your posts to my stuff and also to other people's posts. you seem to grasp the totality of what a person is trying to accomplish. i have found several mobo's that have more than 6 sata ports and processors that are compatible. now whether or not the motherboard and cpu are of high quality or not is debatable, but at least they are within my budget. the combination is set up for raid configuration, though i have never tried that &quot;program&quot;. a server, i believe, is beyond my capacity. and as far as storage, i am looking forward to the esata port and getting an external esata drive to use for my monthly backup that is kept in my safety deposit box. it is my understanding that esata process is a whole lot faster than my current usb 2 external drive which i am currently using for my monthly backup. i do other backups to my internal drives on a more frequent basis. below is the link to the motherboard that i am giving consideration in buying.  these are the most important features of the motherboard in regard to my attempt to build a computer that meets my needs: type of mobo dz77ga-70k socket lga1155 max memory size 32 gb memory types dual ddr3-2400/1600/1333 o.c graphics output hdmi discrete graphics 2 pcie 3.0 x16 # of usb ports 18 # of sata ports 8 # of esata ports 1 raid configuration 0,1,5,10 audio (back channel + front channel)
6197	10	597406	5479530	5479052	willy	7/22/13 10:05 am	1.3744875e12	seems ok	looks good to me, remain with intel cpu and of course the mtrbds. that support it. as for raid, do be sure whatever drives you use are similar and capable of the tasks you plan to do. as for back-up, please consider that any back-up plan can falter, so &quot;redundancy&quot; is a must for anything critical and important, then think multiple copies of back-up. all this will add-up and make it expensive, so again if that's what you want that's going to be an expensive pc once done. you should also consider an ups or power isolater(line conditioner) as well to include a better surge protector. again you're rubbing shoulders with the big boys, good luck. tada -----willy
