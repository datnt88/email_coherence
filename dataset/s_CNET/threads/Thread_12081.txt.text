does anyone know a good wireless-g router (mimo would be nice) that also serves a printer? i've seen a bunch with usb ports in the rear, does this enable storage/printserve capability? thanks.
but i have setup a few of those linksys print servers. why must it be in the router? bob
my main goal is simplicity for the network. i know for a fact that routers with print serve functionality exist...there's an asus joint that has nas built in, print server and a host of other goodies, but it didn't get a very good review.
i've found all in ones to be more problematic. maybe this has changed but i like repeating what works. bob
