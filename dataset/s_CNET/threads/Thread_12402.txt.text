can the maxtor shared storage plus drive be formatted or split-partitioned in a way to allow backups from both a windows xp computer and a mac running leopard? i'm using it currently and am very happy with the drive; just wondering what my backup options are going to be when i get my imac in a couple of weeks. also, i have a canon ip5200 printer connected to the drive with with a usb cable, which i have set up as a network printer. anything special i should know about setting it up on the imac? posting to the maxtor support forums hasn't brought any replies yet.
it's a nas and we don't partition nas products. this is likely why no responses. just create a directory (folder?) for each system and save your copy there. finally, this is not backup. it fails basic rules about backup as in multiple copies, multiple media, off site storage, write protection and more. it does make for a nice online copy. bob
...that the file system mattered, especially if using time machine. is that correct? if so, do i need to format the drive as xfs, efs or something like that?
notice how many systems work...
i'll post back after i have the imac and let you know how it worked out.
