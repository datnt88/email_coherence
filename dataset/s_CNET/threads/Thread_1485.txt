104	4	237362	2425589	2424965	ezellohar	3/9/07 1:45 pm	1.1734479e12	nothing yet	i have not figured anything out yet. i'll be working on it more when i have a chance. still hoping to hear suggestions.
104	5	237362	2425639	2425589	maximavs	3/9/07 2:29 pm	1.17345054e12	worked out	i had the same problem, but i discovered that it was my norton internet sercurity, that was blocking the the new vista computer from seeing the xp machine. i made the xp computer a &quot;trusted&quot; computer, and it popped up in the network. i don't know if that's our issue, but it seemed to work for me. make sure your firewall (windows or other) allows the ip address of the computer through. sean
