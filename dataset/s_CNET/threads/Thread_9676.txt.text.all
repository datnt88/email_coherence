<s> hello, i am looking to upgrade my brother's pc with a pcie-16x video card.  </s>
<s> but he only has a pcie-1x slot available as well as a regular pci slot. is there any way to install the pcie-16x card with an adapter or something?  </s>
<s> if not, what would be a good cheap pci or pcie-1x card to install?  </s>
<s> i'm mostly looking to play games released in the past few years like doom 3, half life 2, and bf 2142 with good performance.  </s>
<s> preferably a card with at least 256mb.  </s>
<s> he has a dell e310 with 2.8 ghz, 1gb ram, win xp. and his psu is only 230w.  </s>
<s> he has an integraded intel(r) 82915g/gv/910gl video card. the pcie-16x cards that i have considered are the ati x800xl 256 mb or the ati x1950 pro 256.  </s>
<s> i know he would need a higher wattage psu for the x1950, if not both.  </s>
<s> anyway, thanks for any help.  </s>

<s> thanks for the link.  </s>
<s> does anyone know how well the radeon x1550 pci 256mb would perform on some recent games like bf 2142? the pci version, not the pcie version.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> read reviews at it's not much faster than a fx5200 so keep shopping. the card i noted should done much better.  </s>
<s> why isn't that an option.  </s>
<s> if you can find a fx5700 in pci form i'll write it's nice for games prior to 2006.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i can't find the x1 card you recommended anywhere for sale.  </s>
<s> but there's an x1550 512 x1 card on newegg that i found: any thoughts on that one?  </s>
<s> i'll check out the fx5700.  </s>
<s> thanks a lot.  </s>
<s> josh  </s>
<s> &quot;pros: works great.  </s>
<s> runs battlefield 2142 on high settings on my dell e310.&quot; try that one.  </s>
<s> note that some had to do some metal work to get it to fit on some machines.  </s>
