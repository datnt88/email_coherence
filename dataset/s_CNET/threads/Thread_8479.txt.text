when more and more games that are featuring dx 10 become available, will this render the dx 9 cards totally useless? and do you have to have windows vista to run dx 10? thanks in advance.
yes, you guessed it. dx10 is vista only. bob
dx10 is the breaking point to get vista. well, it seems ms wants users to be more vista ready and pony up the $. don't look for dx10 capable games to under xp, unless they provide a solution with their s/w bundle(not likely). but heck, it still early since vista was released and all the issues it imposes. tada -----willy
thanks for the info. i was planning on upgrading my video card to dx 10 to play &quot;world in conflict&quot; thats coming out in september. no way i'm gonna fork over the cash for a new os, dx 10 card, power supply, and probably a cooling unit to boot. there's still a lot of dx 9 games out there to keep me satisfied for awhile.
