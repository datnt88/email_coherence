my father is in the market for a color printer to print high quality pictures from a canon s60. i would like to hear from people in this forum, what they would suggest. right now we are looking at minolta magicolor 2430dl, canon i960, epson stylus photo r800 and there are so many hp that i do not even know where to start (though i will look at the photosmart 7960). am i missing anything? as for price, it is not a big concern, he just wants quality prints.
i have pictures from epson c42's and up on the walls at the office and home. would that be good enough? bob
quality, looks like it came from your local photo shop (walmart, drug store, etc) and you would not be able to tell the difference. is that enough of a definition?
i'd have to use the glossy paper. i don't use the glossy paper since it's under glass or acrylic. in closing it does not look like what comes from walmart since its a slightly differenct technology. but i will not go to said walmart since its great stuff. if you want exactly what walmart would look like, then you can not use an ink jet. you'll look at dye sublimation printers. if that's what you want? bob
my understanding, although i don't claim to be an expert, is that while many &quot;home&quot; printers do a very nice job printing photos on glossy or matte photo paper... the ink isn't the same as photo processing ink and eventually your home printed photos will fade. which is to say the pictures will fade faster than if you had them professionally processed. having said that, back up your home photos on cds, make your glossy prints, and if you have to print them again in 5 or 10 years, so be it. in my humble opinion the ability to crop and adjust the photos is such a big plus it outweighs any issue of permanence. my hp officejet 5510 all-in-one does terrific photos. i wish the cost of ink cartridges were lower, but such is life.
