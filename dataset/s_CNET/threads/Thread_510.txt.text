i am using the monitor that came with my dell dimension 4600. the display on the screen constantly resizes itself especially after the computer has been off for a while. when i turn my computer on the display is too big to fit the screen and then after i change it to smaller, the display begins to shrink so there is a 5mm black area around the screen. is there anything i can do to fix this?
by your description of the problem i assume that this is a crt monitor?? how old is it?? john
yes i do have a crt monitor. i have had it since 2003.
does anybody have an answer??
for you to upgrade to the latest technology. if you haven't noticed lately, all desktops are sold with lcd (flat screen) monitors. if you live in the us, you can get one from office depot or best buy at the cheapest for around $200-$250. if you can't afford the lcd, i recommend you to go to the nearest computer store, goodwill or salvation army and pick up a cheap crt monitor for $10, maybe $20. anyhow, if you don't feel like spending any money, all i can say is deal with it. 5mm around the screen isn't that bad but, it would probably aggrevate me too. i like my lcd. the picture is so much clearer. good luck with your search.
once i get some money (just bought a new psu and gpu) i think im gunna buy an lcd monitor. i was wondering tho, could it be the battery inside the computer that is not remembering the size? maybe its loosing its power?
get a friends monitor and try that and see if it does the same thing. then you can see if it is the monitor or the pc. here is a good deal on the link below. i am pretty sure when you are ready you may even get a better deal on a good lcd monitor.  good luck: wendell h
thx for the link, ill try to get another monitor to test my pc with
that will help you narrow it down to one or the other. thank you: and good luck: wendell h
