i recently acquired a 250 gb western digital hard drive that had been formatted on a mac. on both vista and xp machines it is seen in device manager and disk management but not recognized in explorer so i can't access it to reformat it or use it. in disk management it does not have a drive letter assigned to it and when right clicking on its icon all options except help are grayed out. other than putting it back on a mac (as that is not a convenient option) is there anyway that i can get windows to assign it a drive letter so that i can reformat and use it? thanks james
i booted up gparted and dispatched the issue in less than 5 minutes. sorry but maybe there is a windows way but i have my solution so i stopped looking. bob
thanks for the input. i neglected to mention that the hd was in a sata usb enclosure. i took a look at the software you suggested but i couldn't find where it supported usb devices. however your suggestion that i try a partition software reminded me that years ago i had added an additional western digital hd to my system and that it had come with a cd containing some set up tools. the program is called 'data lifeguard tools' and one of the options allows me to partition / format a hd on a usb port. it worked smooth as silk. i am currently moving some files to it. i will eventually add it to my wireless network using a belkin wireless usb hub. this will allow all of the computers on the network to access it and use it as a file storage / transfer device. again thanks for the input. james
yes i've used gparted on both usb to ide and usb to sata drives. data life guard tools is fine too!
