<s> awhile ago i was watching a video on cnet.tv.  </s>
<s> veronica belmont was instructing us how to use two computers with one ipod, and not lose all your files.  </s>
<s> can anyone provide me with the link to that?  </s>
<s> or something similar?  </s>
<s> so here's the url, i don't know if this was exactly what you were looking for, but i think it's close  </s>
<s> but if you turn off the automatic update, in itunes preferences, on each machine.  </s>
<s> you will then be able to attach the ipod to either machine without loosing any music tracks.  </s>
<s> to put music onto the ipod, you would drag and drop from itunes to the mounted ipod.  </s>
<s> hope this helps p post 3 of 3 | previous  </s>
