<s> i have purchased another xbox 360 for the living room to use with windows media center and netflix.  </s>
<s> it is connected via a xbox wireless adapter(802.11b/g).  </s>
<s> when i stream netflix the quality is terrible which defeats its purpose.  </s>
<s> my router is a netgear wireless-n wnr834bv2.  </s>
<s> i'm thinking of connecting the xbox via ethernet instead to a linksys wga600n dual band wireless-n gaming adapter.  </s>
<s> will the linksys adapter give me 802.11n speeds?  </s>
<s> will just upgrading my router(i've read negative reviews) provide better performance?  </s>
<s> i also will be getting a ps3 for xmas and would like to set it up wireless.  </s>
<s> i was thinking about purchasing another router that would support 802.11n with gigabit lan(wnr832bv2 doesn't have gigabit lan) and use the netgear as a wireless bridge.  </s>
<s> so my other xbox 360 and main computer will be connected via ethernet to the new router.  </s>
<s> in the living room the ps3 and xbox 360 would connect to the netgear bridge via ethernet.  </s>
<s> i also have a laptop that will be connected wireless.  </s>
<s> will i get n speed between the routers? is this a better alternative then using 2 linksys wireless-n gaming adapter?  </s>
<s> i really don't want to go through the hassle of running 2 new network cables to the xbox and ps3.  </s>
<s> but i also don't want to waste money buying 2 linksys wireless-n gaming adapters or another router to bridge and still suffer from poor connection speeds.  </s>
<s> then end up running wires instead.  </s>
<s> please help.  </s>
<s> i'm also open to any other suggestions.  </s>
<s> thank you in advance.  </s>
<s> i'll let others answer your question but i went with a refurb 25 buck wgps606 and the 360 and pc on the other end work fine.  </s>
<s> i liked it so much i bought a second unit.  </s>
<s> since 802.11g is over 10 times faster than my cable internet connection i found no reason to consider 802.11n bob  </s>
<s> check this out if you want 802.11n performance:  </s>
