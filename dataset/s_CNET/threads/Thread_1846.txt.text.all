<s> i am trying to decide whether or not to purchase an external hard drive and i am looking for some advice.  </s>
<s> which ones are the best?  </s>
<s> i would like something that is easily portable and that i can have access to whether i am in the office, car, beach, coffee shop, etc. how secure in a sense are these drives.  </s>
<s> for example if i drop it is data going to erase?  </s>
<s> my flash drive has been through hell and back and still works (drops, wash machines, step on, etc.) so i am looking for something like that.  </s>
<s> thanks in adavance.  </s>
<s> m  </s>
<s> the usb memory sticks tend to stand up to drops better than external drives.  </s>
<s> for a lot more money you can find solid state external drives that will survive better than many external hard drives.  </s>
<s> the lesson here is simple.  </s>
<s> &quot;we only lose what we didn't backup.&quot;  </s>
<s> these externals are useful things but do not count as &quot;storage&quot; but as &quot;convenient copies.&quot;  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks for the info.  </s>
<s> are their any you would recommend over others?  </s>
<s> i feel this one is pretty good.  </s>
<s> i've already covered ssd or memory sticks so the drop and survive issue is covered.  </s>
<s> i don't think any make has any big advantage over another.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> whatever that means.  </s>
<s> i have 2 of them (seem ok so far..but have never given it the drop test yet, hehe).  </s>
