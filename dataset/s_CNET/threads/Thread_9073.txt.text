curently i am using win2k3 sp2. my problem is currently my sony dvd-rw can't read dvd but can read regular cds. i tried on other os(win2k8) its is working fine. from my device manager under dvd/cd-rom drives i can see sony dvd rw aw-g170a. several times i have unistalled it and primary ide channel,secondary ide channel but problem persist. under my computer i can see cd drive(g:) and some time it shows dvd ram. i think the problem statred when i made a usb bootable windows xp from my system with bartpebuilder and ultra iso and some setting has been changed in my system. any help is appreciated
&quot;digital versatile disk&quot; have video, data and we also have those udf packet type media. each one has its own issues to solve. you didn't tell which type of dvd was tested. as it stands you could reload the os? bob
hi, bob i have sony dvd-rw but i cant read the media and when i see the properties system says &quot;my computer not responding&quot;. i cant read any dvd data from it but can read only regular cds' but on other os or system it works fine.
&quot;dvd data&quot; could be one of those packet writing udf dvdrw media. for that, all versions of windows would fail. nothing busted so far. just that no one knows how you made the dvdrw yet. tell just a little more. bob
i think its 'dgital versatile disk'. two days back i can read bootable win2k8, i can play movies and read data as well. it could read any data. but i think some configuration changed in os because i tried to make bootable usb with bartpebuilder and ultra iso after that it shows problem.
so go back with system restore, uninstall all the junk! or just format it. good luck, bob
