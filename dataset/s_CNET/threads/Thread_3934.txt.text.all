<s> i'm sure this is one of the most simple things in the world but after hours of trying i still cannot print an enlarged (600% - or any percent!) copy from my scanjet 4370.  </s>
<s> i've tried via the image zone as well as the so-called solution center but without success.  </s>
<s> does anybody have a real solution??! any help gratefully received!  </s>

<s> i am using the hp 4890 scanner and when i want to enlarge a picture that i scan, i scan it and save it to a file in my pictures and then open it up in microsoft digital image 2006.i then change the picture size there and then print the picture.  </s>
<s> i think you can do the same with most photo editing programs.  </s>
<s> the only problem is if you take a small picture and try to blow it up too big the quality of the print goes down.  </s>
<s> yes! that worked.  </s>
<s> thanks for finding a solution for me (can't imagine how they managed to make hp image zone so user unfriendly.  </s>
<s> anyway am very pleased that at last i can perform such an apparently simple (but in practice difficult) task.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> yes, hp image zone has a lot to be desired.  </s>
<s> i guess they think it's free so why give you something that works.  </s>
<s> i am glad that helped.  </s>
