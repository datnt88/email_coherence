unlike many other people. i get this message just once but it appear that none of my usb port seem to work. i run a winxp pro with sp2. i have read many discussion on how to mask the issue by disabling the error message but that does not help my port. everything appear to be great when i check the ports from windows but it seem like there is absolutly no power coming out of it. i have a 680watt power supply that i had just recently upgrade. any help would be appreciated. thank you in advance.
motherboard drivers. but your post wrote so little about the machine that we'll have to wait and see what's next. cheers, bob
what do you mean by that?
microsoft on the xp cd. i must ask why you didn't share details about the machine since i won't check in till tomorrow. sorry if i was not blunt enough, but it does help in resolving this issue. for now read the longer discussion at  where just about every cure was noted. cheers, bob
by the way, i have the asus p5ad2 premium mobo. with the intel p4 processor 540/1gig of ddr2 ram/160gb. sata hd/etc... i have nothing plugged into my usb ports since none of them are working. as far as my bios is concern, i have upgrade it as far as it will go. my drivers are all up to date. i just never thought about using my usb ports until now.
the microsoft &quot;update driver&quot; is not reliable. please tell how you know. bob
well, i install every drivers that i could think of that came with the mobo.
i have a tool that came along with my mobo that constantly detect current drivers anytime that i am logged on. i also allow it to automatically update.
