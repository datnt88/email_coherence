im trying to make it so i am able to connect to my home computer at school, but unfortunately, i am kinda new to this stuff. can someone please tell me how i can make this possible?
you best bet would be ask your school computer department for the correct settings for their particular network. there are no standard always-works settings for large networks such as would be found in a school. dw
thanks, i'll try that.
