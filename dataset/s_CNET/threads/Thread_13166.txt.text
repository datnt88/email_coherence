i have a hp m480n media center pc. its about a year old and i was given the media ctn upgrade, 2004 to 05. now the my tv section won't recognize my tv signal,it did before. this version is suppose to be able to use two tv's, but my 2004 pc has only one tv tuner card. i'm wondering if i have to go back to my original operating system- media ctn 2004 windows xp, for this to work with my tv again. hp listed my computer as able to receive the upgrade.'it was free'. anyone have any idea's? its a pentium 4 3.2ghz mem-1024 mb 3200ddr video- nvidia geforce 5200 w/128mb-dvi-out,tv tuner card with fm tuner. windows xp media center 2005
just because mce 2004 would work with the tv tuner in your pc dosn't mean that it will work with mce2005. call hp to find out about drivers. john
intervideo dvd is the problem. it stops the tv decoder from working. remove it from add/remove software. than download an update intervideo dvd software from hp and install it. as soon as i did this the tv worked again. the answer came from an online hp tech. i didn't see what one had to do with the other, but that conflict was the problem.
