<s> hello everyone, i have a viewsonic 17&quot; lcd monitor that has died. the warranty has just expired and i would like to have it fixed, if possible.  </s>
<s> does anyone have any ideas on where to take it.  </s>
<s> of course viewsonic won't fix it (i'll never buy another viewsonic again) and i have called several local shops and noone else will either.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> thanks, chris  </s>
<s> &quot;viewsonic won't fix it &quot; do you mean they won't fix it at all or just under warrenty?  </s>
