a lot of the cpus sold these days are of 64-bit. but are they of any help at all if i'm still using 32-bit applications on a 32-bit os? and is there any point at all to go into 64-bit if i'm using less than 4gb of ram?
today the apps would run no faster if ported to 64 bit only. the rare exception will be noted here and there but for today you can do wonders with the 32 bit os, 2.0gb ram and a better video card. bob
it's a general argument that i've heard from various sources that 64-bit won't become mainstream in quite some more years to come. if that's the case wouldn't it be more sensible to go down a grade and get a 32-bit cpu instead of a 64-bit?
the core 2 duo gains over the core duo are such that you would get the c2d everytime. essentially you get em64t for free. but the real payoffs for many is the video card (games.) i have to stick with generic answers since we are not talking specifics here. specifics? mysql gets a speed boost from 64 bit. games in general get nothing but by curbing the cost of the usual 64-bit os and putting that into our video card we gain fps. bob
even the $50 celeron e1200 is 64bit. so don't waste your time looking for a &quot;32bit&quot; processor since they are all obsolete.
