<s> bought this p4 desktop in 2001 or 2002, but it is tweaked to my liking, nice sound/video cards, plenty of ram, fast enough, and i am not using it for advanced applications so i want to keep it.  </s>
<s> i remember hearing that as computers age, some parts can go bad.  </s>
<s> should i replace the hard drive?  </s>
<s> also, is there some kind of aging issue with the bios?  </s>
<s> i seem to remember that there is a bios chip or battery that might die after several years, rendering one's system useless.  </s>
<s> lastly, this may be a silly question, but i need to upgrade to usb 2.0, can i just buy a usb 2.0 pci card, and install it, or is a motherboard from 2001 not going to be able to handle it anyway?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> however i do need to remind myself to dust out the machines yearly and replace any failed fans.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> make sure you unplug the pc from ac power before doing anything inside.  </s>
<s> re the rest...start by making sure it's 'relatively' dust free.  </s>
<s> especially make sure the cpu heatsink and fan are to the max extent possible free of dust.  </s>
<s> same with power supply and case fans. the other thing is backup ... storing your must have data somewhere in addition to you pc hdd.  </s>

<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> yup i do make sure that it is relatively dust free, and i unplug and touch a ground first to de-static-ize myself b4 swapping out cards, etc.  </s>
<s> there is a battery that keeps the bios alive when you turn the pc off.  </s>
<s> they last 4-5 years.  </s>
<s> it's located on the motherboard and is a flat, silver battery.  </s>
<s> when it starts to die your clock will forget the time.  </s>
<s> when this happens, replace it.  </s>
