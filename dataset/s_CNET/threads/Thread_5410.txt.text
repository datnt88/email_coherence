after i push the power button, the fans start, the lights for the hard drive and cd flash but then the startup stalls. the system never gets to the point of the beep codes. i have to kill the power to the machine and then restart the system. sometimes it will start then but often i have to redo this up to 5 times. if i restart the system after it has been running, it starts up just fine. i don't mind going through these steps but my real worry is, the time is coming that it isn't going to start at all. this has been going on for about a year, i would say i'm a pretty patient person. i would appreciate any thoughts on this issue. cpu - amd athlon xp2100 motherboard - biostar m7vib os - windows xp home thank you
bad caps
i am sorry but i do not know what &quot;bad caps&quot; means.
bad capacitors is what i'd take the bad caps to be. regards, jb
thanks for the replies. i searched for capacitors and this seems to be a common problem particularly with socket a mother boards. i now have a project because i would guess that i am really on borrowed time with this. thanks again.
try it. it's the first article. has pictures. bob
i didn't know if you meant that my capitization was not correct in my initial post. thanks, i had no idea the problem was so wide spread. i think i will just replace the mb.
