<s> hello, i have been burning cds without any problems, until now.  </s>
<s> sometimes, the computer will freeze during a burn and i have to restart it.  </s>
<s> then, if i try the process again it may burn ok. it appears to be absolutely random.  </s>
<s> any suggestions.  </s>
<s> regards, bert.  </s>

<s> no mention of power or cooling and the rest of the machine.  </s>
<s> however i'd like to read that the power supply is 450 or more watts and that you tried it with the cover off to sniff out cooling issues.  </s>
<s> in closing, no operating system was noted but if compatible i'd run housecall and ewido to eject what they find.  </s>

<s> sometimes it just happens.  </s>
<s> even on a machine that is set up correctly and has no problems.  </s>
<s> happened to me yesterday.  </s>
<s> my explanation is &quot;gremlins&quot;. have never found a good reason, and have learned to not tear my computer apart looking for one.  </s>
<s> after closing nero and rebooting, same exact settings make a good burn.  </s>
<s> if it is more than a occasional thing, then look for a reason.  </s>
