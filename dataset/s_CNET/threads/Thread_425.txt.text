the drive has been clicking for about 3 weeks now. i've moved all files to a new drive, so no fear of losing data. my question is, if the drive really is gonna crash, is there any way i can have it happen within the warranty period so i can have it replaced? from my experience, all comp parts tend to fail just after passing the warranty period!
most have drive diagnostic programs you can download and run. if a problem is found, a failure code is generated and you can often request an rma on line.
here is an excellent video explaining the classic 'hdd click of death'
