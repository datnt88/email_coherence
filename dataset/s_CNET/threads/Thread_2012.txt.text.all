<s> why not try it?  </s>
<s> or better: why not unblock the usb-port?  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> i tried to unblock it , by doing something in the registry (i cant remember what i did) , but didn't work.  </s>
<s> can u suggest how to do that?  </s>
<s> by the usb port is blocked?  </s>
<s> you mentioned the registry.  </s>
<s> more information is needed such as pc, os, etc.  </s>
<s> sorry but the answer is no and furthermore don't do that!!! you could blow the ps2 keyboard/mouse port or damage the usb pen drive.  </s>
<s> if you missed the answer.  </s>
