gateway benefits faster processor: athlon x2 vs. pentium d more ram: 2gb vs 1gb larger drive: 250gb vs 160gb dell benefits: 20&quot; widescreen lcd (sweet). the gateway is the faster pc, but you'd need to spend at least $400 to get a 20&quot; widescreen lcd.
the gateway comes with a monitor. not as good as the dell, but decent. gateway - 19&quot; flat-panel tft-lcd monitor fpd1960 with high resolution, antiglare screen treatment and a sleek flat-panel design, this lcd monitor is easy on the eyes in more ways than one. * take a product tour of this gateway lcd monitor!

the gateway's bigger and faster but the dell's big and fast enough. the gateway has an ok monitor, but the dell widescreen is nice.
