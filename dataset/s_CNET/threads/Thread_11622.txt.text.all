<s> just to let everyone know, i've yet to find one.  </s>
<s> unless you count the s/w bundle you may get with a new drive or system, don't expect to a freebie out there.  </s>
<s> i looked high and low with negative results.  </s>
<s> i wanted to head-off so-called complaints of powerdvd players install for new blu-ray players just wasn't good enough or reliable(upgrades).  </s>
<s> while my new player will have powerdvd it seems others just didn't like it and made bad reviews for it, i hope mine is ok. please advise if you locate one.  </s>
<s> thanks -----willy  </s>
<s> there has been a chilling effect on a free software br or bd player because of the dmca and more.  </s>
<s> if you want to play bd content, i suggest you use the powerdvd or other software and please get it with your hardware to save the cost of the standalone software.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> robert, one reason i posted was to no show results of &quot;no freebie&quot; out there.  </s>
<s> further, since powerdvd seems to be the typical player packaged with new drives, reviews have been heavily negative.  </s>
<s> so far, my exposure to pc type drives is small only because many users just haven't gotten aboard with it yet.  </s>
<s> now, that the pricing seems to be lower than before, the questions are starting to pop-up for my techie response.  </s>
<s> the good news is that other players(paid for) seem to do a better job than powerdvd or at least seems that way.  </s>
<s> not to push any s/w or point to what is good, but since the typical freebies have done such a great job, i wondered why they aren't available.  </s>
<s> already, there's clambering for vlc to get it done, but &quot;no go&quot; for now.  </s>
<s> i think that will change but not soon enough for most of us new bd owners.  </s>
<s> -----willy  </s>
<s> of the dmca and the br/bd software consortium is the primary reason why.  </s>
<s> since almost all br/bd content is protected and the software to play it requires the decoder and there is no open source decoder and the dmca chills the developers you may be waiting a very long time.  </s>
<s> there's also no reason to stick to br/bd.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> is getting bum raps. the hw bundled v7 plays bd fine and like later versions, only decodes stereo, not multichannel.  </s>
<s> for latter you have to pay.  </s>
<s> also trial versions cannot be patched with released fixes so evaluators are left wanting.  </s>
<s> v10 mark 2 has played new discs for me so far without hiccup.  </s>
<s> and don't forget to update reader firmware from mfr if you expect it to work for new discs.  </s>
