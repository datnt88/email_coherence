(just tried it today) i would like to get the 20in or 24in in either way. high or low one. to watch movies on in my room and the shows i buy off itunes. thanks treemen

1092	6	260077	2562874	2562281	grimgraphix	8/14/07 2:27 pm	1.18710162e12	hmmm, can anyone answer this?	i'm pretty good at using autocad, but not sure about the equipment requirements. since autocad is a vector line program... is a more powerful graphics card essential for its smooth running on a mac book booting to windows? if it was a raster based image i would say you need the beefier video support the mbpro offers, but since it is a vector based image the program displays then is the processor power more important? i will have to look this up. along these lines... has anyone here got an opinion about mac-cad ? cheers grim
