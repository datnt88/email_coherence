hi there, i had borrowed a 120 gb fujitsu external hard drive from a friend. i plugged it to my old laptop on which i had run a virus scan and cleaned off all the viruses. the hard disk got recognized this time. then once i unplugged this and plugged back later onto the same laptop, it wasnt recognized. i then connected it to a brand new laptop and it still wasnt recognized. i tried connecting it to few other laptops and it still wasnt recognized. that makes me believe that the hard disk is infected. can anyone please help me with this issue. thanks, csr
try plugging it into a computer with a different operating system. do all of these computers have the same operating system?
for some reason unknown, this hdd. is corrupted. you need some partition/data recovery software to help you out. search cnet downloads to see what's available. good luck.
