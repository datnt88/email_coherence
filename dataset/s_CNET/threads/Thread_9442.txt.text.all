<s> hello well i have done some extensive research and need to buy a dvd burner for some video projects that i do in a local racetrack.  </s>
<s> here is the criteria that it must meet for my needs.  </s>
<s> needs to be double layer for more space on cds, needs to be external either usb2.0 or firewire because my dell has no more internal bays.  </s>
<s> honestly i really do like the best thing out and dont mind paying a good price for good technology.  </s>
<s> i really appreciate your alls help and any advice you can give me thanks.  </s>
<s> last year i bought an nec internal dvd writer, with bundled nero software.  </s>
<s> on opening my compaq pc, i was daunted at the possibility of breaking the plastic shielding, in removing the cd drive, which i intended to replace with the dvd burner, giving me two dvd drives.  </s>
<s> i chickened out and purchased an external drive conversion kit, with cooling fan.  </s>
<s> i am very pleased with the operation of this drive and the ahead software.(nero)  </s>
<s> in the u.k. the lg external dvd drive is very highly rated and is excellent value for money.  </s>
<s> usb connection is via belkin.  </s>
<s> gordon wileman(n.ireland)  </s>
<s> i have a sony dual layer drive in a external usb-2 case (externally powered which i recommend over usb powered).  </s>
<s> total cost less than a hundred bucks.  </s>
<s> data is data as far as the quality of the finished product is concerned.  </s>
<s> if you really don't need portability...why not put in the new cd-dvd-dl in place of one of the older internals cd-r/rw/dvds ?  </s>
