<s> i have purchased a separate adsl ethernet modem (d-link dsl-300t) and a wireless router (linksys wireless g). i would like to be able to access the internet from my laptop (which is wifi enabled)anywhere in the house.  </s>
<s> all the manuals indicate that once the modem is connected to the router, i need to connect the router to my laptop using an ethernet cable.  </s>
<s> my laptop therefore has to be connected to the wireless router with an ethernet cable, which doesn't seem very wireless to me! could someone please let me know how i can have the modem and router in one room, and access the internet from my laptop in another room?  </s>
<s> a friend of mine can do this with his mac setup (a mac laptop and airport extreme modem/router).  </s>
<s> but to setup the router, a wired connection is used.  </s>
<s> once that's done it will run fine without the connection.  </s>
<s> i wonder how you would get the internet without a network since the internet is a network.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> your wireless connection on the router?  </s>
<s> if the laptop will access the router you're done.  </s>
<s> mine works perfectly.  </s>
<s> did the router come with any instructions?  </s>
<s> have you installed it properly?  </s>
<s> have you contacted linksys?  </s>
<s> but do not attempt any router maintenance wireless, use the cord.  </s>
<s> set everything up wired, then unplug and go wireless.  </s>
<s> the computer that you desire to have connected wirleessly must have a wireless network adapter that is compatible with your wireless router.  </s>

<s> do you have any idea what a network is?  </s>
<s> how can you have wireless internet (a network) without having a network?  </s>
<s> if you would read your instructions... you connect your computer {via ethernet} to the router to perform the setup.  </s>
<s> then you disconnect the computer (laptop) and connect the router to your modem.  </s>
<s> enable your wireless adapter on your laptop, and you are good to go.  </s>
<s> note: if it still doesn't work correctly, try a complete power cycle.  </s>
<s> 1)power off computer, power off router, power off modem.  </s>
<s> ---leave off for at least 30 sec.--- 2) power on modem, power on router, power on computer.  </s>
<s> just so you know: that is a network.  </s>
<s> ''do you have any idea what a network is?'' ''how can you have wireless internet (a network) without having a network?'' sound like you have a problem.  </s>
<s> he's asking a question ''expert'' and really doesn't need your -1cent.  </s>
<s> do you know what a phone is?  </s>
<s> answer that.  </s>
<s> any idea to apply this to prevent others from interloping?  </s>
<s> its already set up and working....just cant figure out how to go back and apply this security.....i see many attempts to connect trend micro's thru my wifi detector.  </s>
