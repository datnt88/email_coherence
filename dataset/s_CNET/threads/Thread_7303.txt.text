i'm planning on upgrading my gpu, and i noticed that different manufacturers have same models (eg 7900 gs)... what is the difference between the expensive and cheap ones?
you didn't supply links to the products. common differences are bundled things like a dvd player software to hardware such as passive cooling. bob
here are the two links:   they're suppose to be both 256 mb, but the gainward says something that they overclock it (not sure)... it was somewhere in their news section... plus the label below it says its 256mb...
if gaming is in the plans, it gets the nod. bob
so it really is 512mb? hahaha thanks... you answered all of my questions... never got to thank you for your past help too...
the 256mb version has a 256mb memory interface and is pcie the 512mb doesn't specify interface and is agp ??
since the 2 choices mentioned were different slot types.
