i will try to put the link in here for the 82021 update.  it is on page 3 when searching for stealth iii extreme drivers at driverguide.com. and (because i had a problem today) you don't have to register - you can get in there temporarily with a name of &quot; temp &quot; and a password of &quot; 512 &quot;. please let me know if i can send you all more infomation to find this, now.

thank you for being so helpful. i appreciate your time and assistance. since my screen said i couldn't post anymore to the first conversation i made this a part two. you've been great. thanks again.
you're welcome. but we haven't quite slve this problem yet. so we'll have to wait and see if this driver works. but try and post in the original thread to keep the problem in one thread. when you see the message that no other post is allowed try can click on another post to make your post. good luck. i'll be out most of the day on saturday and will check back this evening.
when i get up the nerve to install the driver i will come back here and let you know how it worked. i'm afraid of killing it entirely when it's only sick for now - but at least i have drivers on hand for when i need them. thanks again.
