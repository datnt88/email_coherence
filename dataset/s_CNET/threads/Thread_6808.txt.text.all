<s> hello, i have been looking for quite a while for a fairly high end grahics card plus a tv tuner that is for a pci-express machine.  </s>
<s> i know there at some out there such as ati all-in-wonder x1800, but i am really looking for a tv in, as well as a tv out, so i cant hook it up to my tv while recording tv, or play doom iii on the tv as well.  </s>
<s> does such a product exist, or do i have to break up my grahics card and tv turner to get the tv out feature?  </s>
<s> thanks matt  </s>
<s> it features: - tv in and tv out - tv recording - tv as second monitor a regular tv tuner card is an input only device.  </s>
<s> but most all modern graphics cards that support dual monitors have tv out capability.  </s>
<s> do you know if xl1800 does the same thing as the xl1900?  </s>
<s> if so, what the major deference it features  </s>
<s> xl1800 and xl1900 are not ati a-i-w model numbers.  </s>
<s> here's what available in the a-i-w lineup.  </s>
<s> all will have more/less the same video/tv features.  </s>
<s> the differences will be with the graphics processors.  </s>
<s> + x1900 a-i-w is the top of the line and great for gaming ($450) + x1800xl a-i-w is last year's model and good at gaming ($350) + x800xl a-i-w is older tech but is still a good midrange gamer ($300) + a-i-w 2006 edition is the current product but with a very low end graphics chip (x1300).  </s>
<s> it's not really suitable for gaming imho.  </s>
<s> ($180)  </s>
<s> hey, thanks alot for the information, it def helped  </s>
