<s> hi i have a cable modem gateway that works on wifi g now. the problem i have is at 100% power i only can get 45~50% signal on my notebook two rooms away.  </s>
<s> i plan to get a desktop on wifi g and one of them new wifi gaming system due out next year.  </s>
<s> i was looking at the d-link dgl-4300 gaming router.  </s>
<s> it looks like it's got a lot of power and range?  </s>
<s> than most other router of it's kind? is this as good as it looks?  </s>
<s> i like the 108mbps power and the gigabit stuff.  </s>
<s> or can you think of a better router certified by wifi?  </s>
<s> thank you for your help and time.  </s>
<s> sounds proper to me.  </s>
<s> it's simple physics.  </s>
<s> with that omnidirectional antenna, the power emits in all directions and exponential decreases as you move away.  </s>
<s> another router/wifi unit has the same laws to contend with.  </s>
<s> if you are the only user, fashion an deflector like this -&gt; parabolic antenna for wifi found with this google.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> man if i can put one on that will help, but my gateway has a built in antenna.  </s>
<s> i was told not to go with it but i did.---so i need a new wi-fi g router, we have 2 users and one more soon?  </s>
<s> and need one that can give great power all around the house we got two computer to the east side of the house (about 20' away) one on the gateway.  </s>
<s> and when we add on to the house some far north (about 30' away?) i use the notebook all over the house but it works on low signal from the gateway, but i think it can be faster.  </s>
<s> thank you for your help.  </s>
<s> it's all physics, so dive in.  </s>
<s> hi thank you for your great info i think that will work great, but i need some thing that fit in to the living room.  </s>
<s> this is a problem for me since i was told to go with apple/mac airport router.  </s>
<s> i have all macs-- i did not get it becuse i think it's too big and won't look good in the room some of my family member has problem with large computer stuff in the room.  </s>
<s> this is why i bought a small gateway router.  </s>
<s> my hope is to get one that i can use at 40'/ 360 around with great power and speed.  </s>
<s> i use my laptop all around my house.  </s>
<s> man i might need to go wire i am new to this wifi thing and it's hard to get it just right!!! again thank you for all your help.  </s>
