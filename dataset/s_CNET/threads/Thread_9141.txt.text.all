i have a dell pc without internal usb headers. 
i am looking for an internally installed all in one media card reader with a method of connection for a pc without an internal usb header. 
does anyone know if such a device is made or any work arounds? 
maybe your common external can be mounted internally then run the usb cord through the machine and out the back to a port. 
then again i just used an external and velcro'd it to the machine. 
they're usually called x+1 cards where x is the number of external usb ports and the +1 is an internal port. 
you can pop the internal usb connector off to access the header.
