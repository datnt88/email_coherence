<s> i have a dell pc without internal usb headers.  </s>
<s> i am looking for an internally installed all in one media card reader with a method of connection for a pc without an internal usb header.  </s>
<s> does anyone know if such a device is made or any work arounds?  </s>
<s> maybe your common external can be mounted internally then run the usb cord through the machine and out the back to a port.  </s>
<s> then again i just used an external and velcro'd it to the machine.  </s>
<s> they're usually called x+1 cards where x is the number of external usb ports and the +1 is an internal port.  </s>
<s> you can pop the internal usb connector off to access the header.  </s>
