<s> i just bought a hp 8300f multi media computer.  </s>
<s> everything works fantastic with the expection of getting the tv to work.  </s>
<s> i connected my satellite tv coax cable to tv/cable input and performed the hardware wizard and at the completion of the search there is no signal detected, same for manually doing it. the tv card has dtv antennae, s-video, tv/cable, and fm ant connections.  </s>
<s> i am using vga output cable to the monitor.  </s>
<s> previously i had a combo monitor/tv with this same cable connected and it all worked fine, but now trying to run it thru the computer instead of directly into the old monitor i get no results.  </s>
<s> is this an id10t error?  </s>
<s> can anyone give me a hand?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> has to be converted to tv format by receiver first.  </s>
<s> agreed, the cable i am connecting to the computer comes out of the dual tuner dvr box supplied by dish satellite.  </s>
<s> goes to pc's regular rf input instead of atsc?  </s>
<s> and select that input in your software setup.  </s>
<s> pc will only tune ch 3 or 4 depending on your box setup.  </s>
<s> thanks for the help.  </s>
<s> i have realized the same thing, the pc works on channel 2, 3, or 4, and my dish box is programmed for channel 116.  </s>
<s> talked with dish, and they say that tuner 2 on the box can only output to channel 60, 73, or 116, tuner 1 outputs to channel 3 or 4. our local dish installer is a neighbor who will stop by to correct for me.  </s>
<s> his price quote was &quot;some beer&quot;.  </s>
<s> again thanks for the help.  </s>
<s> who's your favorite comic book person?  </s>
<s> sgt.  </s>
<s> rock (dc) or nick fury (marvel)?  </s>
<s> sgt fury is a character created by the greaseman, a once popular dj in dc/maryland.  </s>
<s> one of the first shock jocks.  </s>
<s> too bad he never worked again after mlk comment (afaik).  </s>
<s> greaseman & co may have 'nick'ed the name from nick fury's original comic: &quot;sgt.  </s>
<s> fury and his howling commandos.&quot;  </s>
