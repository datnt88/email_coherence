hi, i want to buy this capture card to transfer some vhs tapes in my computer. does anyone have any experience with it ? also, how would i capture the sound from the vhs ? the only sound output is an rca jack. thank you.
i used the ati and hauppauge cards for the capture step with the audio plugged into my pc's audio line-in jack. after the capture i used ulead.com's (demos are there) for the video to dvd creation. the downside to this is that you can count on 6 to 10 hours of work for each 1 hour of dvd. not that you sit there for each hour, but that's the usual time it takes for the pc. bob
i have hunted high and low for my software disk for this card to no avail. is it possible that i could get you to duplicate yours for a fee? please help me, all i want to do is copy some camcorder video to digital. jgreaves42@hotmail.com
