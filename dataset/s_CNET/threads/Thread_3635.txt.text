hey everybody... i need to know if any of the apple 20&quot; or bigger lcd screens are compatible with normal pc's? thanks in advance... ngatiaruan.prince
but u need a good gfx card that supports it and has dvi connector. if u want to game and use that cinema screens then u need like 7800gtx. lower end gfx card may be able to support the monitor but gonna be major lag.
the 20 & 23'' will run with a card, that has a dvd-i (analog/digital)connector and supports a resolution of 1920x108p. from the research i've done on the 30'' apple cinema, you need a card that supports a dual-link dvi-i digital connection, that can run this monitor at its native res of 2560x1600.
i have the 7800gt on my pc running the 30&quot; apple cinema display. here is a list of cards, that will work. on the apple macintosh platform, the following graphic controllers supports the apple 30&quot; display. nvidia geforce 6800ultra ddl agp for powermac g5 nvidia geforce 6800gt ddl agp for powermac g5 nvidia geforce 6600 pci express for powermac g5(pci express) nvidia geforce 7800gt pci express for powermac g5(pci express) nvidia quadrofx 4500 pci express for powermac g5(pci express) for the pc windows platform, the following graphic cards support the apple 30&quot; cinema display: nvidia quadrofx 2000 nvidia quadrofx 3000 nvidia quadrofx 3400 nvidia quadrofx 3450 nvidia quadrofx 4000 nvidia quadrofx 4400 nvidia quadrofx 4500 nvidia geforce 7800gt nvidia geforce 7800gtx nvidia geforce 7800gtx 512 cheers, vb
