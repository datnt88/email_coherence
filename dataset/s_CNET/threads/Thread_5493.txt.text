hi i am trying to recover my data from my hard drive after serious boot up problems and copy the data on secondary pc though the non bootable pc had a password on so how do i recover my data? thanks
1. did you read this forums top post? (it has suggestions) 2. if the host machine can't boot cd or anything, try a cable like this from newegg.com or such -&gt;
hi i have got into my hard drive by hooking it up to my laptop through a usb to sata cable to retrieve my data but password permission makes it inaccesable how do i get my data back? thanks originally had a problem boot config data booot\bcd status 0x000000f but i want to get my data before i reformat the hard drive as i tried running the master cd and i tried non destructive recovery wicj didnt work so i wanr to get my data off off before i reformat (i will be backing up from now on lesson learnt!)
it includes a method where the password is not required.
