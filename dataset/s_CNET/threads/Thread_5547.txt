(on aquamark03 i'm getting 18000) but i'm lagging a lot on bf vietman. i've heard upgrade ram and video card. which would work better?

9780	2	163964	1814293	1814176	hshagel08	3/17/06 12:17 pm	1.14259782e12	7800?	with all of these new cards coming out how long do you think it'll take for the price of a gf 7800gs to be in the $130-150 range?
9780	3	163964	1814649	1814293	ramarc	3/17/06 2:39 pm	1.14260634e12	1 year, if ever	nvidia has a 6 month project refresh cycle. they just refreshed their line, so the next big thing won't be out until the fall. the 6800gs will probably fall to $120 by then and the 7800gs should be about $200. the following refresh (about the same time as windows vista is debuting) should make the 6800gs (or similar) an entry-level card and the 7800 should reach your target price. however, by then pci express may be so dominant that agp becomes a niche market and niche product prices don't fall as quickly as mainstream products. that's why the 7800gs with 16 pipes is more expensive than the faster 7800gt with 20 pipes. ditto with x800xt agps selling for $280 while x850xt's are only $170.

9780	5	163964	1816955	1816807	nathanpsz2	3/19/06 3:52 am	1.14274032e12	that would probably be...	...their dual-core 7900gtx with two gpu's and 1 gb of ram on each card. imagine two of them in quad-sli. i'm also hoping that 7800 prices go down; i'm looking to replace my x600.

9780	7	163964	1818062	1817222	nathanpsz2	3/19/06 4:22 pm	1.14278532e12	hopefully it will	here's nvidia's homepage. they're having a countdown for the new graphics card.
