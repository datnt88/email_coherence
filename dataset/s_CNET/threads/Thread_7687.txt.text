i have a hard drive inside of a usb external hard drive enclosure. i dont know what model it is, but its a 200gb seagate that was originally in a hewlett packard laptop. the other day it started making the clicking sound ive heard you never want to hear. well i have tons of precious files on that hard drive... any ideas on what i can do to possibly recover all if not some of the files?
it's at  where we progress from free to try before buy to data recovery houses. in your case i'd remove the drive and try it in a new case and hope you don't need to send it to data recovery. -&gt; where was the backup copy? bob
you can test your hdd with another usb external or pc for make sure it's still clicking or not. if it's still cliking, time to go for data recovery service because your firmware failure.
an external hard drive clicking noise can often be caused by loose cable connections. this website has more info on this:
if you can still access the ext. hd do a back-up or copy whatever critical files to your main hd, cd/dvd media and/or flash drives, whatever media you have, now! the other posters offered good advice don't hesitate to use it or act on it. further, you should use this as a lesson in regular back-up procedure just in case it happens again. tada -----willy
