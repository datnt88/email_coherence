i make a new form in server properties but when i go into printer properties the form does not show in the list of paper to choose. tractor also says unavailable. any help will be appreciated.
and maybe an lq 24 pin model. you'll need to provide your os and whether or not you found a proper driver for this relic. i've noted that a generic windows 32 bit is about all epson offers.
nothing really old about it, it's used to print cellphone voucher tickets in wide format using tractor. support say they have never seen this problem. thinking either printer fault or needs new installation of win xp serv 2. installation looks very good and there r no viruses present. hoping 4 something more helpful.
that's easy to check on another machine (your test machine). if it works there, it's something on this machine. if it fails there also, we start suspecting the hardware. not clear, by the way, what your os is: &quot;win xp serv 2&quot; means &quot;windows xp sp2&quot;? and why not sp3? kees
i get where u going. i was trying to avoid taking his printer from his office but it looks like heading that way thanx anyway. i prefer sp2 to sp3 because i get smoother networking linked with win7 in my internet cafe.
