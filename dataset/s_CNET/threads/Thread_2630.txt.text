my computer froze up on me recently, so i switched off the power supply. when i booted up again i had found that my 320gb hard drive now only has 127gb.. all my files are still around but most of my ripped movies now have a size of 0mb. i am running windows 7, the hard drive is a seagate barracuda 320gb 7200.11 what is going on?
what does disk management say about the disk?  is a not too clear article about it. the most important thing: don't change anything. don't chkdsk. don't defrag. just look with disk management and tell what you see. i assume your off-line backup still is ok. so you won't lose anything, whatever you do. still, it makes sense to be careful. kees
disk management says that there is 170 gb unallocated.
it was deallocated (assuming it was in normal use). was it a separate partition (d: in stead of c:) or was there one drive that now has become smaller? time for trying a few datarecovery programs and see what they can do. for example: recuva (free), getdataback, zero assumption recovery (free trials). it's best to take the disk out of the machine, and into an external enclosure or on the other side of a usb2 to ide/sata-cable and do those experiments on another pc (or on this pc once you installed a new hard disk with an os). kees
it happens a lot to externals. this is usually where most learn that these are not storage but where we keep a copy and have backup copies. the top of this forum has the usual recovery software and the company if you forgot to backup. bob
a friend of mine put this computer together for me, i'm not too computer savvy. don't know why he did not make a partition for windows, all i have is a c:\ drive. what can i do to re-allocate this lost space? i'm not too fussed about the lost videos, i have most of them backed up.
i'd reassign my optical drive to say letter &quot;o&quot;. then when you create the 2nd partition and format the hdd, it would be automatically be assigned &quot;d&quot;. vapcmd
