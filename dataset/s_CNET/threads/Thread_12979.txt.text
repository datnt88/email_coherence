i have a dell 4550 running a p4 2.6 with 1 gig of ram. my current video card is a geforce4 ti4800 agp. the card has been wonderful and i play almost all games with video settings maxed out. i've been wanting to get a new video card simply because i can't play games like battlefield2 because the geforce4 isn't directx 9 compliant (or something along those lines). can anyone recommend a good card that would work for me? i'm looking to spen around $150-$250. i've been looking at a geforce 6800, but to be honest, i can't sort out the different models too well. i have a 4x agp controller. on a simple level, will i be seeing any improvement going to an 8x card?
yeah, i believe a 6800 is your best bet when it comes to a agp slot. this seems like a very nice one.
or if your for little more power this would be a very nice addition and it seems to be in your price range.  especially for bf2, which is a keeper to put in the video game library.
