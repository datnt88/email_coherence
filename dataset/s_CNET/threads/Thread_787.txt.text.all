<s> i currently have 2gbs of ram installed and want to know if it's possible to upgrade to two 2gb sticks for 4 total.  </s>
<s> also i want to upgrade my current video card to this one will it fit?  </s>
<s> i know i should just get a new computer and mine is old, but i really just have to make due with what i have right now.  </s>
<s> if anyone has any suggestions on how i can improve my computer they will be appreciated.  </s>
<s> looks like 2gb is the limit.  </s>
<s> gpu. the first link works. the second is busted.....at least for me......does it work for you?  </s>
<s> i was going to suggest a video card but the 160w ps stopped that idea as you'd need a better ps to go with it.  </s>
<s> i seriously doubt adding ram will provide a noticeable performance boost either.  </s>
<s> you might consider banking the cost of it until you're ready to move on.  </s>
<s> i know that's not what you're asking but, imo, it's reasonable advice.  </s>
<s> did a quick check on the specs and it states it will support 4gb, that's 2x2gb sticks of ram.  </s>
<s> you have to remove the current 2x1gb to do that.  </s>
<s> however, if you're running the 32-bit os, it will report 4gb of ram but can actually only use 3.2gb of it, due to os limitations.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
