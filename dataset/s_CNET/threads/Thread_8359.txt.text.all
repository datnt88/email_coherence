<s> i was thinking about buying a laptop and having the screen replaced with one that has a higher resolution.  </s>
<s> so, i went to this website and they had 2 different kinds of 17&quot; wuxga screens.  </s>
<s> one was just a screen and the other was labeled &quot;glossy&quot;.  </s>
<s> they were both the same price.  </s>
<s> now, why would i want a glossy screen?  </s>
<s> wouldn't that reflect all kinds of light making it difficult to see, especially outdoors?  </s>
<s> if i'm not understanding what &quot;glossy&quot; screens are, please inform me.  </s>

<s> they explain it better: i prefer matted myself.  </s>
<s> its a little more costly to make a matted display but glossy with it problems or advantages they both become the ying-yang of displays.  </s>
<s> since, you saw the displays, check them out more closely.  </s>
<s> you will find if you look at an angle of a matted display, you don't see all of it proper(great security) while the glossy does reflect light.  </s>
<s> however, the color seems to come out more and the matted is more washed out.  </s>
<s> but, on very good displays, the differences become slight and really it becomes preference once you decide, do recheck them again.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> great information.  </s>
<s> it helps a lot.  </s>
<s> now my problem is deciding which i prefer.  </s>
<s> i hate how solving one problem can lead to another.  </s>
<s> many thanks, -jonathan  </s>
<s> you can look at laptops or regular monitors...the glare/reflection issue remains the same on either device.  </s>
<s> if you only use the laptop in one location and you can control all the variables...overhead lighting, sunlight, etc, glossy, bright is fine.  </s>
<s> if not, then matte finish is far nicer to use overall under a variety of locations and conditions.  </s>
