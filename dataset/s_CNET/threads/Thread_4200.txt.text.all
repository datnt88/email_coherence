<s> hi, my computer is running very slow and i have very low disk space (c-drive).  </s>
<s> what can i do to correct this?  </s>
<s> to stay within the forum discussion of hardware, you would add more ram and move to a larger disk.  </s>
<s> however in the computer help or the os forum, they may suggest deleting old files, and streamlining the os. but since this is a hardware forum and you didn't tell what os, i'm left with the hardware suggestions.  </s>

<s> the statement &quot;computer is running very slow&quot; seems to imply that it ran faster at some earlier time.  </s>
<s> not sure that points to a ram problem.  </s>
<s> ok excuse my stupidity, i'm not very computer literate.  </s>
<s> my computer runs slow and i assumed it was connected to the ram but if i am wrong could you please suggest what i would do to enable it to run faster.  </s>
<s> i gather that i must but more disk space?  </s>
<s> if so how do i know which disk space i am to buy.  </s>
<s> again, sorry for my stupidity  </s>

<s> disk space is space on the hard drive(s).  </s>
<s> if they are all filled you need to replace &quot;them&quot; with a larger size hard drive.  </s>
<s> we still don't know if you actually have three drives, or one drive with three partitions or two drives with one of the drives having two partitons.  </s>
