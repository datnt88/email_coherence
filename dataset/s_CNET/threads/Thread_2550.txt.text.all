<s> hi, i hope someone can help me decide here.  </s>
<s> i am looking for a personal printer.  </s>
<s> i guess that would be a color inkjet.  </s>
<s> i have read all reviews and going crazy by now.  </s>
<s> i am so undecided.  </s>
<s> i have read good stuff on the epson c86 printer and canon i560 printer.  </s>
<s> does anyone know which one is better?  </s>
<s> or does anyone have a better suggestion?  </s>
<s> i really appreciate your help, rachel  </s>
<s> both are nice printers and i keep buying a new epson about every 3 years when my personal unit at home dies.  </s>
<s> there was a canon in there but when a set of inks exceeded the cost of a new epson i went back to epson. the laser printer is still working some 8 years later... bob  </s>
<s> bob, i checked the ink prices for both printers the price is almost the same for both.  </s>
<s> i am not sure if i got this right.  </s>
<s> still undecided here, thanks, rachel  </s>
<s> i was sharing my &quot;story&quot;.  </s>
<s> in the case when i tossed the bjc1500 the set of inks was going to cost me 99 bucks.  </s>
<s> the new epson was $120 and less with rebate.  </s>
<s> so i went back to the epson. the canon was 2 years old and the epson compared to the 2 year old printer has better output.  </s>
<s> both printers are very nice.  </s>

<s> well assuming you want a color printer, i have an hp6122 here and it works fabulously.  </s>
<s> re: ink prices, i got on the refill bandwagon and that has worked out very well, altho i confess there is a sizable learning curve involved in learning the little techniques of refilling the cartridges.  </s>
<s> (i buy from atlascopy.com) if you do a lot of color printing it's definitely worth doing.  </s>
<s> black cartridges are a lot easier to do-- i have refilled a black cartridge twice now, which has paid for the refill kit 4 times over.  </s>
<s> for simple text i find the inkjets have a certain amout of fuzziness on regular paper, also they are not waterproof, so for that i use hp laserprinters.  </s>
<s> for bulk printing i use an hp iiip, and a 1012 for faster fancier stuff.  </s>
<s> --fj  </s>
<s> i'm a big hp fan, and my...must be going on 4-5 yrs.  </s>
<s> with my hp deskjet 712c that i use for everyday printing.  </s>
<s> january of this year, i bought a canon i960, that prints absolutely incredible photos.  </s>
<s> epsons are also known for the quality of their photo printers, but the canon has something like a few thousand ink-jet nozzles to spray the ink compared to epson's few hundred nozzles.  </s>
<s> cost in january, 2004- $150.  </s>
<s> price must have come down by now.  </s>
<s> go to a place like circuit city, do some test prints and compare.  </s>
<s> people can't tell my canon photo prints are from a printer.  </s>
<s> for everyday workhorse type of printer, if hp has kept their standards from years before, i like hp; seems like my old hp is going to last forever.  </s>
<s> i find ink prices in general fairly pricey, but i guess it depends on how much you print.  </s>
<s> i still haven't changed any of the ink in the canon from when i bought it- 6 seperate colors.  </s>
<s> but it's not as if i've printed a thousand pictures; a couple of hundred 4x6 at most, but when you get a new printer, they don't give you full ink cartridges, more like 2/3 full according to the staples salesman.  </s>
<s> seems like there's enough ink in there to print another couple hundred.  </s>
<s> i have an old epson 880 and it prints pictures very well.  </s>
<s> i buy the ink cartridges from printpal.com.  </s>
<s> 4.95 for b&w, 5.95 for color.  </s>
<s> any printer manufacturer that has proprietary ink cartridges is off my list (hp for example) refilling is a messy pain.  </s>
<s> i use an hp office jet- all in one for everyday printing,scanning,copies & faxing.but  </s>
<s> for my photos i purchased a canon i9900,very pricey but i'm completely blown away by the pics it prints.you must remember,no matter what your printing or printing with,you always should use recommended paper and ink types.it  </s>
<s> doesn't pay to try and save money on cheaper papers and inks,especially with photos.happy  </s>
<s> printing.shannon  </s>
<s> have the canon i560 and love it.  </s>
<s> it is fast and does beautiful print and pictures.  </s>
<s> are you limiting yourself to epson and canon and not considering hp or lexmark or some other brands?  </s>
<s> in that case, i think epson is better.  </s>
<s> i had started using epson wayback (epson dot matrix), and is still using a six year old stylus color 440 while my friends bought canon.  </s>
<s> mine is still working, while they had already replaced theirs (and with epson brand too).  </s>
<s> in comparison, canon inks should be more expensive since their inks have their print heads in it like hps.  </s>
<s> i appreciate all your input, thanks!  </s>
<s> i think i will end up with the epson c86 since i will be using the printer not that often in addition i am getting a good buy on ebay ;)! thanks again, rachel  </s>
