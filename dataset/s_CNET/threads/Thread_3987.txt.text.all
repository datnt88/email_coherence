<s> does anybody know if they are any coupons for the dell se198wfp?  </s>
<s> it's a pretty cheap monitor as is (plan to buy it anyway), but i was wondering if anyone had any dell.com coupons to knock another 10% off.  </s>
<s> i scoured for some on google for awhile but had no luck, although i did find when this monitor was originally released, it was $189 vs. $199 it is now.  </s>
<s> anywho, any help is appreciated.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't mind saving a buck or two (which is why i'm getting this monitor in the first place).  </s>
<s> try here: i didn't see one for that particular model, but there were some for others.  </s>
<s> yeah, it's not there, but thanks for the link.  </s>
<s> i'll use that site in the future (good layout compared to the other coupons sites i've seen).  </s>
<s> well dell just dropped the price today of that monitor by $10 bucks and it turns out they have no price guarentee.  </s>
<s> i should have waited ten more days to order.  </s>
<s> oh well, but if there's anyone out there wanting to get it for cheaper, now's your chance. the sale lasts until oct 4th.  </s>
<s> at least i didnt lose as much as the iphone guys.  </s>
