<s> last night, i turned the computer on but did not login, this morrning, i heard the computer making weird noises, and became extremely slow.  </s>
<s> so i was not sure what was wrong, and decided to turn the computer off and restart.  </s>
<s> but i was not able to start windows xp, not even safe mode in command prompt.  </s>
<s> does anyone know what could possbily be wrong with this computer?  </s>
<s> without hearing the noise but adding the slowdown i wonder if some fan has failed.  </s>
<s> how old and are you planning to replace the fan yourself?  </s>
<s> the computer is an old desktop that i bought in 2001, so i have not really had any plan to replace the fan.  </s>
<s> currently when i try to turn on my computer, it just makes really loud fan(?) sound, that i usually only hear for about 20 seconds when the computer is started or when i run larger applications.  </s>
<s> given the age it's likely a maintenance issue.  </s>
<s> that is, time to clean it up and replace those fans that are loud at startup.  </s>
<s> what you find is that this is cheaper to do yourself and if you take it in you find the bill to be that of a new machine.  </s>
<s> so here's my question.  </s>
<s> why not fix the machine?  </s>
<s> sure, i'd love to, but i'm no expertise in computer hardware by any means... so any help from anyone would be appreciated...  </s>
<s> watch but i can't offer a tutorial on replacing fans.  </s>
<s> minor skills such as what was needed in the above video and finding the fans at newegg.com or geeks.com is all you need.  </s>
<s> beware taking it to the service counter since you don't want to know the usual fees.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> is there any troubleshooting i can run to narrow the problem possibility down to the fan?  </s>
<s> when you perform the cleanup as you see in the video once it's cleaned up you can leave the cover off, power up and find the dead or humming fan.  </s>
<s> that's the one to replace.  </s>
<s> not everyone wants to work on their own hardware.  </s>
<s> if not you have a choice of a service counter or a new machine.  </s>
