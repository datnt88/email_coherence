hi there, i have just recently built a new system and have a question about the memory settings. here is the mobo, cpu and memory being used. intel dx38bt motherboard, intell core 2 quad q6700, and corsair twin3x2048-1333c9 the memory is ddr3 capable of running at 1333mhz i have a total of 4gb of ram, so four 1gb modules. here is my question. i've been reading places that the memory is 1.7v memory and the mobo is setup (default) to run at 1.5v. corsair's website shows that the spd is set at 7-7-7-20 at 1066mhz and nothing about the voltage. it also states that the memory was tested at 1.7v, 9-9-9-24 at 1333mhz. there were some people stating problems with the pc locking up over time because of the 1.5v setting. what i was wondering was, can i leave the 7-7-7-20 settings and up the voltage to 1.7v with no issues? my other question is should i be using the 9-9-9-24 settings if i decide to up the voltage to 1.7v? any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance...
&quot;what i was wondering was, can i leave the 7-7-7-20 settings and up the voltage to 1.7v with no issues?&quot;  shows that's beyond it's spec so i'll write you should run it at the specified and supported settings. if you are overclocking then you are off the reservation and no one can tell you will be fine. bob
1.7v is the necessary voltage to achieve ddr3-1333. see  &quot;tested together at 1333mhz, vdimm = 1.70v, at latency settings of 9-9-9-24&quot; you'll have to manually select ddr3-1333 and enter the 9...24 timings, otherwise it will default 1.5v (ddr3 standard voltage) and ddr3-1066 timings. you can try to keep the tighter 7...20 timings at ddr3-1333 but there's no guarantee it will work reliably. you should run some memory tests and super pi loops to ensure the system will be stable.
