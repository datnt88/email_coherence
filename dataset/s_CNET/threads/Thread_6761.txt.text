i have no idea if i'm even going to build this setup, but i got bored so i looked up parts on newegg.com: thermaltake tsunami case  benq lightscribe dvd+rw  liteon dvd-rom drive  evercool 92mm fan  thermaltake 120mm smart fan  arctic cooling freezer 7 pro  wd raptor, 74gb, 10,000rpm  microsoft natural 4000 keyboard  logitech mx518 mouse  1gb ocz gold series memory  viewsonic 19&quot; widescreen monitor  epox ep-5lda+gli 945p socket 775 motherboard  aspire 500w power supply  pentium d 930  logitech x-230 2.1 speakers  msi 6600gt graphics card-pcie-x16  so what do you think? this system will be used for 1/3 gaming and 2/3 completing daily tasks.
not sure how intel spreads that memory around to the two cores. only one hard drive?? i know that it's a raptor, but??
a 7600gt will pwn the 6600gt in games. if you can stretch your budget, get a 7900gt.
should i get a better power supply, like an antec or thermaltake model? also, is my motherboard fine, or should i upgrade to a 955x or 975x?
and i like this case (maybe cause i own it!) it looks like the thermaltake one, for $30 less. the mobo is fine.
