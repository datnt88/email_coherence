<s> so, shipping my computer had some unexpected side effects, one of which is my cd-rw drive seems to be broken.. if i go into -any- program to burn a music or data cd or copy one.. it seems like it's working.. in fact, it 'completes' it and the cd pops out after it's 'done' but.. the cd is always empty but cannot be reused.  </s>
<s> i've tried with different cd types to no avail. the hardware is hooked up, and registers as working right.  </s>
<s> no new drivers or anything sooo... i'm pretty much screwed with that one, right?  </s>
<s> i'm okay with that as my other cd drive works and i don't use the r a whole lot.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't mind upgraded to a dvd drive anyway - i guess it would be a dvd writer so i'd still have the cd writing capabilities.  </s>
<s> i don't imagine this should be too hard.  </s>
<s> how do i find out if my motherboard can handle that?  </s>
<s> and what's compatible with my system?  </s>
<s> and finally, what's recommended?  </s>
<s> i've never had a dvd drive and so i totally have not caught up with the technology.  </s>
<s> you gave no mention of your system specs/details.  </s>
<s> on this matter a replacement dvd in lieu of the cd drive will be ok. just drop it in and set the jumpers, ect.  </s>
<s> to your needs.  </s>
<s> most retail boxed dvd drive will have the help guide and any r/w software required.  </s>
<s> beware, the dvd may not be seen as a dvd and the s/w is important as if xp based system won't follow the easy drop to disk writing, you'll need that provided s/w.  </s>
<s> as for brands i suggest the hp, lg, or lite-on and maybe sony.  </s>
<s> if you desire &quot;lightscribe&quot; option that's up to you.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> as for specs, right now i've 768megs ram, 20 free gigs of space and, according to hp my motherboard is asus a7n8x-la.  </s>
<s> it seems i wasn't quite as in the dark as i thought i was - simply took some looking up of the new terminology - like light scribe which seems pretty dandy.  </s>
<s> i'm seeing things about ide/eide/sata which seem to be the connection/cable type. is there a certain type i would only be able to use?  </s>
<s> my current drives use ide (which, according to some is really eide?) but would i be able to use sata or eide if i found a writer i liked better with those options? the ones i am looking at right now are lite-on, hp, lg or asus.  </s>
<s> i've been checking out reviews from a certain competitor site. the pricing is actually much more reasonable than i expected!  </s>
<s> i'm not entirely sure by what you mean with 'set the jumpers.'  </s>
<s> jumpers, those are small plug thingees that need to set.  </s>
<s> this tells the system either master/slave -or- cs setting for use on the cable.  </s>
<s> once, you remove the old cd, review the decal/sticker and see what its set as. you can use that to help set the new drive.  </s>
<s> for most, you probably have an eide type cd drive, thus a new eide is required, also known as a pata vs sata type.  </s>
<s> as for a brand pick one, if you've a hp system, then keep it in the family or not, pick one of the others.  </s>
<s> it really doesn't matter in the long run.  </s>
<s> adios -----willy  </s>
<s> it doesn't have lightscribe but it's getting great reviews from buyers.  </s>
<s> might want to check out lightscribe before you get to set on it... it might require more than it's worth.  </s>
<s> you should probably get an ide cd-dvd drive if your mb is the asus a7n8x mb....the a7n8x-la is an asus mb made for hp we need more info about the hp model number and series to assist further.  </s>
<s> happy computing vapcmd  </s>
