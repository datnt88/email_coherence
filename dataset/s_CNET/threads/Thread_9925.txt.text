hello, i want to build a nice gaming computer, and i have slightly over a grand to spend on parts (not including monitor and operating system, those are covered already). i have some general computer knowledge, what parts handle what and i have a pretty good idea of where to plug them in. that being said, when buying parts i'm at a bit of a loss. i'm not sure when looking at a motherboard for instance, what i need to be looking for. i think i might could find some high performance parts, but i'm really worried about them being compatible if anyone has ideas on some good compatible parts or possibly tips as to what i could run into as far is incompatibility issues, that would be great. thanks, nicholas
has recommendations on these things, and their recommendations have been tested, so you should check there. if you don't get a combination that's been tested, you're rolling the dice. they're supposed to all work together, but we know how murphy loves computers! good luck.
