(i tested this 20 times with the same video and got the same result each time.) i also tried changing cables and power cycling, but that doesn't make a difference. did i get a bad router? i also tried connecting to the router wirelessly. while speedtest.net shows a slightly slower speed (i.e., 20 mpbs), the buffering on streaming video is still ungodly slow. why is this happening? someone please help me before i rip all my hair out.
