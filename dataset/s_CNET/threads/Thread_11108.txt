(i'm using a dial-up connection right now and it's frustrating lol). what i've done: tried different cables. (crossover & also straight) checked on a different lap to see if the ap is working fine and configured correctly. on the other lap the ap connects succesfully wireless. only 1 laptop is connected at a time. uninstalled & reinstalled the wireless card. deleted the wireless connection and created a new one. get rid of sp2 for winxp and reinstalled. update driver on 3com ethernet adapter. nothing worked!!! here are my ipconfig results: microsoft windows xp [version 5.1.2600] (c) copyright 1985-2001 microsoft corp. c:\documents and settings\cland&gt;ipconfig/all windows ip configuration host name . . . . . . . . . . . . : cland primary dns suffix . . . . . . . : node type . . . . . . . . . . . . : mixed ip routing enabled. . . . . . . . : no wins proxy enabled. . . . . . . . : no ethernet adapter wireless network connection : media state . . . . . . . . . . . : media disconnected description . . . . . . . . . . . : dell truemobile 1150 series wireless lan card physical address. . . . . . . . . : 00-02-2d-8d-09-16 ethernet adapter local area connection: media state . . . . . . . . . . . : media disconnected description . . . . . . . . . . . : 3com 3c920 integrated fast ethernet controller (3c905c-tx compatible) physical address. . . . . . . . . : 00-08-74-e4-40-5b ppp adapter prodigy: connection-specific dns suffix . : description . . . . . . . . . . . : wan (ppp/slip) interface physical address. . . . . . . . . : 00-53-45-00-00-00 dhcp enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : no ip address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 148.221.85.197 subnet mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.255 default gateway . . . . . . . . . : 148.221.85.197 dns servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 200.33.146.194 200.33.146.202 netbios over tcpip. . . . . . . . : disabled c:\documents and settings\cland&gt; any help please?
