<s> i have heard somewhere that there is a size limit to hdd when used with a p2 or p3 computer and wondered if anyone knows because i am about to purchase a new hdd and don't want to get the wrong thing.  </s>
<s> maybe it was a limit on hdd size with the os system used, i have no idea.  </s>
<s> i have a p2 350mhz 256 ram and a 4ghz hdd and i also have a p3 400mhz 128ram and a 8gb hdd using windows me and xp. these are my backup computers and still very functional and i would like to spruce them up a little so any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> notes the common limitations.  </s>
<s> you may be running a dos based windows so that is a limit to 127gb if the bios supports such.  </s>
<s> many will not update a bios, but i always do this in my upgrades but your choice.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> earlier versions of windows don't support hard drives greater than 137 gb, but windows 2000 (service pack 4) and windows xp (service pack 1) do.  </s>
<s> please note that for both oses, the service packs are necessary.  </s>
<s> if you have sp2 (xp), you're in great shape, but if you don't have even sp1, you need to upgrade.  </s>
<s> windows 2000 needs sp4 to support more than 137.  </s>
<s> actually, you could get a 200gb hdd and use it with any version of windows, you'd just be limited to 137gb, and the rest of the hdd would just sit there, not being used.  </s>
