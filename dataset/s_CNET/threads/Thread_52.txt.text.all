<s> hi there, im not sure if this post fits in this area, so i apologize in advance i am new to cnet.  </s>
<s> anyway i recently built my first pc.  </s>
<s> specs: cpu: quad core q6600 mb: asus p5n-d ram: kingston hyper x 2gb hdd: seagate terabyte gfx: nvidia geforce 8500 os: vista ultimate 32 bit the question i now ask is will crysis warhead run on my pc? i downloaded the original crysis singleplayer demo and turned the spec way down, this caused it to look horrible...which doesn't suprise me neither does it appeal to me. the reason i now ask this is because apparently they optimized crysis warhead to run far better on a wider range of pcs (im guessing lower spec).  </s>
<s> so what is your opinion do you think it will run at an acceptable level?  </s>

<s> i'm going to write no. you may have to look at &quot;the list&quot; and see how far up you can go on that list.  </s>

<s> the geforce 8500 is a low-end card.  </s>
<s> crysis warhead is more forgiving than the original but it still needs at least a mid-range card like a a $100 9600gt to run smoothly without resorting to low res/low effects.  </s>
