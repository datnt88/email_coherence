-how does the 6600 gt match up to the 1600xl ? and the x700...isnt that a good card too. i am talking price/performance wise? -should i get a stock card from nvidia/ ati or go with the different board manufacturers like sapphire/powercolor thankz
couldnt u have compiled your questions in one post?
ati oursourcses their cards and brands it as their own, so you can only get different board manufacturers. x1600pro is what i suggested, but there are no benchmarks on it, but benchmarks to its brother x1600xt, the 6600gt is around equal. roger
sorry about the excess of posts...i had mainly 2 questions but keep pressing &quot;create new discussion&quot; instead of &quot;reply to this message&quot; -
