running xp media center, p4, 3ghz, 1gb ram, 256 ati radeon x1300 pro video card, psp x, gateway. ok, when i am trying to work on pictures (can be 1 loaded into program or 50 pics)the system starts slowing down badly. my other system is a slower computer and can fly through the pics (1gb ram, 128 video card). i am just not sure why the faster system is slower, any help would be greatly appreciated.
sounds like you have either a driver conflict fault or, a driver problem, have you tried different versions of the driver? are you running a raid setup h/d? try pressing ctrl/alt/del and see what programmes are running in the back ground you may be suprised how much memory they take up! also have you set your bois settings to use your max memory for your vid card, pallete snooping sometimes causes a conflict try turning it off if it has that option. i had similar fault when i installed an x800xl, was down to driver/mobo conflict, did you buy the sys ready built or did you build it? more sys info would be helpful
have not tried different driver versions, no raid, programs in background are fewer than my slower system (i run minimal background apps-running about 200-220mb pf usage...msconfig...). yes it is amazing how much memory is used, however my older system handles up to 850mb pf usage, (not sure if the pf is a good tell tale, but it is something i can go by...lol)new system slows and &quot;thinks&quot; at about 350mb pf usage. video bios settings have been taken care of---256, not sure what pallette snooping is. ready built system, i added vid card. intel 915g socket 775a....i think it is &quot;a&quot; onboard video, sound, etc. i disabled onboard vid in bios when i installed card. i am thinking it may b a mobo problem as this is a refurb, or just operator problems...lol. going to try resuming onboard and see if maybe vid card is bad.
such as what software
