anbazhagan, please post again in the windows xp forum, and tell more than you tell here. - what mail are you using (outlook express, hotmail)? - what browser (if there's a browser involved)? - what 'page errors'? - any more wrong than just a mention of 'error'? anything you can't do? - what's the full message of spybot? kees

sorry for the duplicate post. does  help? it finds articles on manual remove, it seems. kees
i used spybot search and destroy and it always finds dso exploits. i would recommend this and it is free to download. however a donation is appreaciated..they say.
