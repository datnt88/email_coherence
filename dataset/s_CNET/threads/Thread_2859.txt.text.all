<s> i desperately need a new computer, and it should be suited for autocad, 3d max, photoshop and other graphics software.  </s>
<s> does anyone have any advice?  </s>
<s> i have not decided wheter to buy a finished computer, or build one.  </s>
<s> i am grateful to any advice.  </s>
<s> thanks!!  </s>
<s> can you afford $1400 or only $600?  </s>
<s> does your budget include monitor?  </s>
<s> do you need multiple monitors?  </s>
<s> you need to set a budget and specify the monitor setup you want to use before you can get any good advice.  </s>
<s> well, the main thing is to get a great computer, but of course i would like it as inexpensive as possible i know, however, that i probably have to pay a bit, and i guess more like $1400 than $600.  </s>
<s> i do not need anything else than the machine (no monitors or anything).  </s>
<s> i am thinking of using intel core 2 quad ..., a mb that fits it and a graphic card compatible with open gl and active x-9 or more (if i decide to build it myself).  </s>
<s> i know that different components not always go together, and if any of you have some experience with parts that go well together, it would be great to hear about it.  </s>
<s> determine the primary s/w pkg.  </s>
<s> you want and then find its requirements.  </s>
<s> using autocad, google for it for results.  </s>
<s> i like to refrain from terms like &quot;powerful&quot; it should be more like &quot;capable&quot;. you don't really need a fast cpu but rather stuffed ram and decent video.  </s>
<s> if the s/w takes advantage of &quot;multiple core cpus&quot; then again, it needn't be the fastest but get one that your mtrbd.  </s>
<s> fully supports, easily.  </s>
<s> as for a mtrbd., pick top-end brands as anything cheap will certainly hurt once the crunching starts.  </s>
<s> of course, be sure the case is well cooled.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> all you need to decide is whether or not you want a &quot;professional&quot; graphics card.  </s>
<s> consumer cards will work with most cad/rendering apps, but may have minor incompatilities -- the professional card has been tested and has better drivers to ensure higher precision and compatibility.  </s>
<s> you need not worry about &quot;parts that go well together&quot; since all pci-express x16 cards will work in any pc equipped with an x16 slot.  </s>
<s> personally, i suggest you start with a mid-range quad core like this $800 gateway lx-6200, phenom x4 9500, 8gb ram, 750gb drive, vista 64bit and add a $100 geforce 9600gt . the 9600gt will exceed the raw performance of a $450 quadro fx1700.  </s>
<s> call a custom build shop in your area, hopefully you have more than one so you can comparison shop.  </s>
<s> give them your requirements and budget and go from there.  </s>
<s> a custom build is usually the preferred way to get your computer for the things your going to do, but hey, give dell a looksee and compare price with the custom shops...(xps series)  </s>
<s> thank you all for advice.  </s>
<s> i have had a lot of computers, custom made, ready made and some i have built myself, and the ones i have been most satisfied with are the ones i have built myself.  </s>
<s> that can be plain luck, but it can also be because the ones one can buy in the shop if one have a budget, are often not the latest, but maybe 6 month old machines.  </s>
<s> if one will have the latest in parts, the machines will be very expensive (norway is one of the most expensive country to buy stuff in, thanks to horribly high taxes).  </s>
<s> and that is why i am considering building a new computer myself.  </s>
<s> i appreciate all the tips and advices i have got so far, and will start looking for parts thanks.  </s>
