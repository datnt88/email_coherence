<s> hi all,i jus got me this 1999 apple mac,and was thinking on upgrading can anyone give me some suggestions on how i can do so at a low cost?...  </s>
<s> the mac forums:  </s>
<s> there must be at least 5 different models of 1999 apple mac's.  </s>
<s> you have given no clue about what you actually bought, so giving help is impossible.  </s>
<s> other than memory upgrades there isn't much you can do with a mac to upgrade.  </s>
