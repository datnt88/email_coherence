hi all,i jus got me this 1999 apple mac,and was thinking on upgrading can anyone give me some suggestions on how i can do so at a low cost?... 
the mac forums: 
there must be at least 5 different models of 1999 apple mac's. 
you have given no clue about what you actually bought, so giving help is impossible. 
other than memory upgrades there isn't much you can do with a mac to upgrade.
