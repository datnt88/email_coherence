(from your post you are already doing this.) the goal of the company selling the computer is to keep cost low and one way they do this is by using a small/weak power supply (and some other components). they select the power supply size by what the power consumption specs of the parts it is sold with use. the computer will usually work until you up grade with a power hungry video card or additional hard drives. this often shows up as failed boot ups, sometimes requiring 3 boots before the computer is stable or artifacts appearing on the screen from nowhere. so keep this in mind when planning to up grade your main stream pc, a new high power video card may require a new bigger power supply. if the new pc arrives and you dont like it take it back. i have returned as many as 3 pcs when buying just one. i took one back because it was broken out of the box. 2 more because the software i wanted to run would not run, by the specs the software should have run. i went through 2 model upgrades and 2 computer companies before i found what i wanted and that had to be built to order. this was made easier by the computer store i used being next door to where i worked. when returning the pcs i used the supplied restore disks to clean them up. more thoughts when buying direct or online. 1. read the return polices of the vendors you are interested in with the idea you may have to use their return policy. look for full refund not just exchanges. 2. when prices are close, watch for low price computer but high handling and shipping fees. 3. watch for os being preloaded with no os cd included, may need to pay more for real cd. if you ask for real os cd and pay for it, make sure you get it. 4. dont throw away the packaging, you may need it to move it or to send it back. 5. don't forget to get a ups to plug the new computer into. clean power into the the computer will extend it life and keep crashes due to power failures at bay. i have onwed compaq, gateway, hp, and dell. all of them worked but i was never happy with them and that is why i build my own now. the perfect pc is just a compromise of what you want and what you can get. good luck
