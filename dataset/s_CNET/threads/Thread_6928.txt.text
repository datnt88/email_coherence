i have an epson workforce 630. i am using it to temporarily replace our main office copier/fax machine until its repaired. initially i could not send or receive faxes, but then i was instructed to turn off error correcting mode (ecm) and turn off v.3.4. after i did this i was able to receive faxes and i was able to send a test fax to epson which they received, but when i try to fax to other numbers it does not go through. any ideas as to why this might happen?
i've found some machines will not work with each other and the fax does not go through. you may find folk that demand an answer but the simple truth is &quot;it does not always work.&quot; bob
actually, from my point of view you make a big problem of this. it's much more easier to use an online service for this stuff. like  for example - those are great guys. they just give you everything you need about faxes and they have really low prices and a free trial period, so... you can just try it.
i looked at the site and did not find one word about the problems folk have with fax. this issue is not new, but when you have a product to sell, you may not want to talk about the problem areas. bob
