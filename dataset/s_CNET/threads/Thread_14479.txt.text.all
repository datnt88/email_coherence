<s> i'm tired of moving my notebook around and i'm about to set my outlook to work based on the external hard drive and have all my docs there.  </s>
<s> i would be moving far less weight.  </s>
<s> i was thinking of getting a disk with a firewire connection so it goes faster.  </s>
<s> would like to know if anybody has tried it before and how it worked...  </s>
<s> even today i don't recommend firewire drives on windows.  </s>

<s> as to where the pst is, outlook can be told to point to the external drive.  </s>
<s> rather than duplicate the web, i'll stop here.  </s>
<s> does it work?  </s>
<s> yes. is it reliable?  </s>
<s> varies with each user it seems.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i appreciate your point.  </s>
<s> do you think a drive with a usb connection is more advisable?  </s>
<s> i just want to avoid changing the notebook for those small netbooks!  </s>
<s> when we talk windows i go back to usb.  </s>
<s> you are more than welcome to try firewire but what risk is there since you'll keep a backup for the day it fails or goes missing?  </s>
<s> and the same for usb drives.  </s>
