look at this:
thanks a lot. that is a lot of great info. so i guess my agp slot is the universal and that it should fit the 2x or 4x?
even 8x cards function in 2 or 4x slots if they plug in. they will run at the 2 or 4x speed. cheers, bob
good info but would it really fit mine?
you can examine your agp slot and see if the new card will allow it. in short, there can be 2 &quot;keys&quot; that stop incompatible cards from plugging in. bob
good advice
