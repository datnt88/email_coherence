hello. i hope this finds everyone doing well! i was wondering about my networking needs? i have a &quot;wired network&quot; because of physical disabilities and was wondering what equipment i needed for the following setup. all i want to do is run (2) pc's on the same desk connected to the internet at the same time. i have a scientifiic atlanta wired (rj45) cable modem. would the following be all i need to purchase? linksys - etherfast 5-port 10/100 workgroup switch speed - 10/100 mbps auto detecting - yes auto sensing - yes number of lan ports - 5 lan connection - rj-45 ethernet leds - collision , power , speed uplink - portyes or do i need to purchase a wired router like the one below? dynex - 4-port ethernet broadband router speed - 10/100 mbps auto sensing - yes number of lan ports - 4 system requirementswindows and mac operating systems, linux; internet explorer or netscape navigator versions 6 or above; installed ethernet adapter lan - connectionethernet &quot;the above brands/products are just for question purposes. i am not really familiar with either company and they're equipment or status in the industry&quot;. i would greatly appreciate any positive feed back on this matter. every penny counts these days with medical bills overwhelming me. i am hoping i can go with the 'linksys' just because i have heard and read that they have semi-reliable equipment. sony pcv-rx650 winxp home sp_2 ie6/firefox 3.06 ati radeon gpu 256mb ram 1 gb ram installed 80gb hd's above details are for both systems. thank you, not-a-clue
a switch is designed to work behind a router, not alone. linksys is one of the top brands along with d-link. belkin is another and they have a basic wired router for about forty bucks. it is also wireless in case you need that for future.
appreciate feedback! sorry it took so long but i appreciate the advise. please consider this thread closed.
