i run a dell 2400 dimension with wireless microsoft mouse. 
every several [5] minutes my mouse cursor will jump down and to the left at a 45 degree angle about 5-6 inches. 
i have change batteries and didn't help. 
any suggestions? 
thanks td 
dear tdon, no clue... if this is an optical mouse, maybe there's a piece of paper or dust that gets in the way, or stuck at the light sensor, which makes it go weird once in a while? 
sorry, -aintel 
i have a miscrosoft wireless optical mouse blue reciever. 
do batteries have to be 1.25v or 1.5v?
