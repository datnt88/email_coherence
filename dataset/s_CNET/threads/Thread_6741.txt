9872	4	265437	2592284	2591562	rrch	9/25/07 7:32 pm	1.19074872e12	still issues	sorry about the wait guys. i still got my day job to worry about . this morning, my computers actually made a lair out of me. i pulled everything up to find that they were not on the network this morning (not even under the net view). -coryphaeus i am indeed running zone alarm on all the computers except one. i disabled them (and will continue while trouble shooting), but it only seemed to help for only a moment on only one of the computers. -rick most of the computers i intentionally do not set to sleep, but after your suggestion, i did go and recheck all of them. there was only 1 computer that was set to go into sleep mode; i fixed it to where it would not do it. -bob from the looks of it, none of the computers are on the network most of the time. i have tried this over and over again, but keep getting this message (using the net view command): &quot;system error 53 has occurred the network path was not found&quot; it will indeed show most of the computers when they are all on the network, but there is one computer that will pull up all the others when you are on it, but it does not appear on the network at all to the other ones (when the network is working of course). i was able to get the network up and going for a few minutes this evening messing with it, but when i tried the same stuff again, it did not work. this whole thing appears to be completely random now. something interesting of note, the back up hard drive that is hooked up to the router is always visible from my computer (one of the computers on the network). another thing is that on the router, all the computers and their names are visible when i pull up the dhcp chart. anyhow, hope this helps you help me . thanks to all for continuing to help me.

9872	6	265437	2593145	2592523	rrch	9/26/07 5:35 pm	1.1908281e12	ok then	tomorrow evening (cannot do it this evening), i will unplug the modem for my isp (btw, my connection is a sat. connection, and the modem is supposed to act as a router itself, do not know if that could cause an issue or not) from the router and disable all the firewalls on all the computers to make absolutely sure that the firewalls are not causing this. lets hope nobody wants to put a logic bomb in before it take it off . as far as the naming issue, should i try making up a new workgroup to put all the computers under?

9872	8	265437	2594352	2593166	rrch	9/28/07 7:05 am	1.1909631e12	sorry misunderstanding	what i meant was that i was going to unplug the modem (which as i understand is supposed to act like a router itself, as well as a modem, but it is not the main router for the network), and leave my wifi router plugged in. that way i can take off my firewalls, because there will not be an internet connection, but leave the network intact. i did not get a chance to work on it last night as i thought i would. i will try and see if i can get it done sometime today. what i meant was that i was going to unplug the modem (which as i understand is supposed to act like a router itself, as well as a modem, but it is not the main router for the network), and leave my wifi router plugged in. that way i can take off my firewalls, because there will not be an internet connection, but leave the network intact. i did not get a chance to work on it last night as i thought i would. i will try and see if i can get it done sometime today.
9872	9	265437	2595702	2593166	rrch	9/29/07 8:40 pm	1.1910984e12	tried it	well, i finally was able to get to it. i unhooked the modem from router and disabled all the firewalls on all the computers (windows firewalls as well). the computers still showed to be connected to the router, but when i tried the new view, it still gave me the message that there was no list. i also tried just using 2 computers on the network and got nothing. do you have any other suggestions? thanks raymon
9872	10	265437	2595843	2595702	r. proffitt	9/30/07 6:27 am	1.19113362e12	the election process of a master browser...	takes time. microsoft wrote a knowledge base article which pegs this time from a few minutes to weeks. i expected this to fail since there was no dns and even with your change you can't expect instant results since there is still no dns and until microsoft's code runs for awhile to elect a master browser as well as all the machines to do their queries i can see where this should fail at first. firewalls in the norton and mcafee products are well known to keep working even when disabled so the only fix for that is to toss them out. i have yet to see these makers address this issue. bob
9872	11	265437	2595855	2595843	rrch	9/30/07 7:31 am	1.19113746e12	i was wondering if i was going too quickly.	here is my ignorance talking, but is there a way to manualy set the master browser? my personal computer that is on the network is usually the first one to be turned on in the morning and off at night. if i can set that, it would be perfect for it. if not, is there anything else that i can do? i really, really do *need* this network set up and running. raymon
