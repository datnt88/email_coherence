<s> i've been reading up about external hard drives since i plan on purchasing one for my laptop.  </s>
<s> but for every good drive i hear about, there are 3 bad reviews of it.  </s>
<s> it also seems that reviewers like cnet give a good review, while the user reviews are completely different (poor).  </s>
<s> basically, which drive would you guys recommend as a reliable drive.  </s>
<s> p.s. i'm looking for a 250gb drive.  </s>
<s> thanks, duckhunter  </s>
<s> for me, i just buy an external usb case and then a drive to put in it.  </s>
<s> i'm unsure what i'm missing by paying for them to put the two parts together.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i hear some of the usb cases have heating issues.  </s>
<s> has this ever been a problem for you?  </s>
<s> i haven't seen this issue. the larger case i use is for a 5.25 drive (can house cd/dvd/rw drives) and has a fan. the smaller unit has slabs of aluminum that do get warm but nothing moreso that a drive in a desktop.  </s>
<s> my answer is... no. bob  </s>
<s> thank you for your help.  </s>
<s> i'll look into getting a case and drive separatley.  </s>
<s> i use a 60gb drive in a belkin enclosure.  </s>
<s> it has a fan and heat has never been an issue.  </s>
<s> i like seagate drives the best and find their recent switch to a 5 year warranty a good sign.  </s>
<s> recently amazon had a 160gb seagate external drive for $119.00 after rebate. the drive stood upright taking far less desk space than my current drive.  </s>
<s> i plan to watch for this offer and use it next time i see it.  </s>
<s> every seagate drive i buy has a $50 rebate and they process and get you your money in a timely manner every time.  </s>
<s> i have three seagate drives on the shelf.  </s>
<s> they will provide additional space or replacements in our five desktops.  </s>
<s> hi duckhunter, i can't tell you which external hard drive to buy, but i have a different caution.  </s>
<s> if you are buying a usb 2 drive, make sure your computer has usb 2 ports.  </s>
<s> if it doesn't you can add a pci card with usb ports for a modest price, but then you have the issue of whether your os can see a usb 2 device.  </s>
<s> if it can, the third caustion applies only if you like to make images of partitions or drives from dos.  </s>
<s> some imaging programs (acronis true image, norton ghost) can see a usb 2 drive while operating in dos, but some others can't.  </s>
<s> good luck, dan s  </s>
<s> thanks for the advice.  </s>
<s> my computer has usb 2.0 ports so that is not a problem.  </s>
<s> i plan on using the drive as drag and drop drive, but thanks for the warning about using imaging programs.  </s>
<s> if you read this today 11-27 is still possible to order norton systemworks 2005 premier for free after rebates.  </s>
<s> (although at the moment they have the wrong rebate form posted). in includes norton ghost.  </s>
<s> norton acquired the drive image product, so it should be a good program which can backup under windows. the one touch drives are very quiet.  </s>
<s> hopefully the new ver.  </s>
<s> ii drives are faster.  </s>
<s> lacie drives sound very good.  </s>
<s> they apparently have no fans.  </s>
<s> tigerdirect has a very inxpensive enclosure.  </s>
<s> microcenter was selling maxtor 250 gb for $119.  </s>
