482	4	91814	1089682	1086782	jacksonbleu	4/1/05 6:39 am	1.11233754e12	chuckieu	yes i did everything from contacting manufacturer of motherboard and computer maker and redownloaded every driver that they had for this board, plus uninstalled, and reinstalled every attachment to my system but still get the same errors on start-up. belarc only shows the items i have on my system at present so why would these found new hardware errors keep coming up?
482	5	91814	1090995	1089682	chuckieu	4/1/05 11:09 am	1.11235374e12	this is why we own computers,	they are so much fun and so reliable. just a long shot, but have you tried clearing your cmos? all you would have to do then is reset the clock. record your current bios settings first. sometimes they can get someting irrelevant stuck in their feeble little minds and won't let go of it. good luck. chuck
