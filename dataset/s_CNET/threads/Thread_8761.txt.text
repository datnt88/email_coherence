... in the &quot;available wireless network list.&quot; i have had two desktop pcs connected to my wired home network. i also had a d-link wbr-2310 wireless router installed. i had created an &quot;unsecure&quot; wireless network (abc123) to use my laptop. it was working fine. i was able to wirelessly connect to the internet and peek into the desktops. yesterday, i decided to make the network secure by putting in a wep key. after that, the network has disappeared fro the network list and i have not been able to do anything with my laptop, wirelessly, that is. when i try to create a new wireless network using the wireless wizard, it asks me you want to create new network or add a computer to the existing (abc123). so it is there somewhere. hp c751nr laptop; xp pro; d-link wbr2310. please help!
we cover this in the top posts in this forum. who is saying this is secure? with wep cracking in 2 minutes what security is this? bob
why are you using wep? it can be hacked in 30 seconds?
thanks bob for your comment. i am not a techie. i just thought secure is better. anyway that is hardly the point for me now. i just want to connect wirelessly to the internet. any thoughts?
how do i do that? pardon my ignorance.
go back to what worked or move to other setups such as noted in this forum's sticky. my question is still &quot;who said that is secure?&quot;
thanks everybody. i was able to fix the problem by resetting the router and reinstalling and reconfiguring it.
