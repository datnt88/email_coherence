my daughter is moving into an apartment complex that is supplying wi-fi for the whole complex. she has a 3-4 year old dell desktop and has been using cable for her internet. what is the best way for her to connect to the wi-fi, usb adapter or a pci card also, would it pay her to purchase 802.11n draft or 802.11g.
if a slot is provided. they're easy to install and configure and they stay firmly parked in the laptop. 802.11g should be fine. there won't be an advantage with the n draft...especially if it's not implemented in the apartment complex.
when he turned that desktop into a laptop. that said, get a pci wireless nic for the desktop, stay away from usb units. he is correct in that unless the complex provides -n, just stick with -g. unless you can find a -n unit on sale as they are backward compatible. wayne click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software (and a great chocolate-cherry cobbler recipe). there are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't.
pci of the type that has a detachable antenna and cable that's not fixed to the card will be less limiting as you can move the antenna for best signal strength
i disagree about the g vs n....always get the best technology you can afford....cuz if she moves and the next place has n and she wants more speed, she'll have to cough up more cash...what a waste. and she has more flexibility with wi-fi usb...she can just pull it out and nobody can surf for garbage when she is not around
