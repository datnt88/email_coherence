i'm in possession of a maccolby which i'm going to sell, but before i sell it i would like to know more about it. i tried looking around the internet for any information at all but there wasn't much to find about it, so i was wondering if any one here might know anything about it.
for example. if you want to keep it but safe why not a computer museum? i've seen the better ones let you put it on display but keep ownership. bob
i sold one of these on ebay a couple of years ago. at that time i did an extensive search. i did find a little information, but there just isn't much available. if you are interested, i may be able to help with the sale. not sure how to pm on this forum, but if you reply with interest we can figure something out.
is it still fully functioning?
