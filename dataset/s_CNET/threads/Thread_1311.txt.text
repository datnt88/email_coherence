the best computer is a sony vaio desktop with intel pentium 4 prossesor extreme edition with hyper threading technology. i would have to say that hewlett pacard is about the worst computer anyone could own.
apple (if you've paid for applecare) is simply divine. sony service can't be found in north america so it gets a &quot;no sale&quot; for me. bob
sony,lol what a joke just try to find a part for it and you will change your tune fast,the 2 best computers i found so far is apple,and dell,and not big on them but also digitals
