<s> i recently built a new computer, however it seems to be unstable due to an issue with the power supply or grounding? the system has powered down on three occasions.  </s>
<s> in one scenario i detached the usb-cable from one of the four usb-ports in the back.  </s>
<s> in the other two, i slightly moved the computer while it was laying on the carpet.  </s>
<s> not only did it power down - it would not boot again. the only way i could make it boot was to detach the pci-cards, the pci-e graphics card and even the cpu.  </s>
<s> after resetting the bios, and mounting the cards, i was able to get it up and running again.  </s>
<s> at this time my system runs ok, however i am worried to detach or attach any cable as long as the system runs.  </s>
<s> i never had a problem with this on my other self-built systems.  </s>
<s> i am very curios as to what cause this problem!  </s>
<s> any response would be much appreciated.  </s>

<s> check your work.  </s>

<s> with all due respect, sir. it doesn't matter if it &quot;sounds&quot; like it is the first machine i've built.  </s>
<s> it is not.  </s>
<s> i am just trying to put the point across that i did build my own machines before and that i never experienced this problem before.  </s>
<s> on the other hand, though, i am certainly not a professional.  </s>
<s> first timers or not, this issue is repeated too often so i toss that out first.  </s>
<s> i was not there to watch you build the machine so i have to offer the most common issue.  </s>
<s> also try using those fiber insulators on the mounting posts just to make sure.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thankyou very much for your fast reply, sir!  </s>
<s> i never used fiber insulators on the mounting posts before, but i am certainly willing to give it a go - sounds like a good idea.  </s>
<s> btw - when working on my problem, i could hear the sound of a loose screw when tilting the cabinet.  </s>
<s> could the loose scew be the cause of my problems?  </s>
<s> never let a screw loose in a pc. it's metal and could cause a very unhappy event.  </s>
<s> power off.  </s>
<s> tilt it this way and that until you find it and get it out of there.  </s>

<s> we would check for this sound on machines arriving and leaving... bob  </s>
