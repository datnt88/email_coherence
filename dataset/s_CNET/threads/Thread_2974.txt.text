i would like to get a samsung sata 18xdvd+r dvd burner w/12x dvd-ram write and lightscribe. i have a 4 yr old pc amd and would like to know if a sata is compatible or should i use a ide? i use xp windows. i have added additonal ram card earlier, have lots of ram. i think the card was a ide. i never had a dvd player in this yet but there is an update slot and connections for one. i understand this is an oem plug and play and looks easy to install for this novice on dvd's. i also have the nero burning program already i use with my cd burner, will that be compatible with a dvd player like this. thank you for any help. cb
some older motherboards do not have a sata port. just get the ide and it will plug and play. nero? only if it is equipped to burn dvds, only you can answer this. and you will need dvd player software. if you're running windows media player, visit my site below and go to the free software link. download and run the windows media player dvd helper. it will install the codecs that wmp needs to play dvds. wayne click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. 5 db hot.
just my opinion but after watching hundreds struggle to get sata support into their xp os i'm going to pan sata here and suggest you get the old pata version. that will work with just one thing to do. set the jumper according to the rules. bob
i'll stick with the ide or pata version just to be sure. thanks for the help. i have another problem, but am posting that in a new thread.
