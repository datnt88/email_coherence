<s> hello, my husband just bought a gateway notebook computer for home and travel use.  </s>
<s> went into this without really knowing much about notebooks, but he really wanted one (happy early father's day to him :-)) anyway....where do we start about getting wireless internet?  </s>
<s> what do we need to buy?  </s>
<s> we have a one level house currently using dsl (roadrunner) for our 2 desktops.  </s>
<s> should we get wireless through roadrunner?  </s>
<s> someone mentioned said no...use wireless cards????? any information would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> 1) did the new laptop come with integrated wireless.  </s>
<s> these days, most all do, but that's not absolutely universal.  </s>
<s> if it has wifi, then you don't need anything more for the computer.  </s>
<s> if it does not have built-in wifi, you'll need to buy a pc-card wifi adapter (it slides into the little slot on the side of the computer).  </s>
<s> 2) are you using a broadband router for sharing the dsl between your two desktop machines?  </s>
<s> if so, you'll need to replace it with a wifi unit.  </s>
<s> that will be a one-for-one swap. the new router will have 4 wired ethernet ports for the desktops, but will have a radio chip and antennae too for the wireless.  </s>
<s> you'll have to follow the directions for setting it up for your specific connection, but that's usually pretty easy.  </s>
<s> if you are not using a broadband router for sharing the dsl, then you will need to tell us a bit more about that.  </s>
<s> if you are using some sort of routing capability in the dsl modem, then you'll need to disable that to put it in bridge-mode and then install a wifi router.  </s>
<s> thanks for the information.  </s>
<s> the notebook did come integrated for wireless.  </s>
<s> so we are okay there.  </s>
<s> we will need to get the new router so we will start there.  </s>
<s> thanks again  </s>
