<s> i've chatted with hp support and they suggested i buy a new printer.  </s>
<s> it's an hp 1315v all in one and we're running xp. it will print a full page on 20 lb paper but will only print two inches of the same image (with psp) on 61 lb matte photo paper.  </s>
<s> i've tried all the settings and the printer will pick up the matte paper, and it just stops printing but won't eject the paper itself, i have to push the on button for it to eject the paper.  </s>
<s> i've never had this problem before and it's been a really good printer.  </s>
<s> i blame the fact that i just spent $$ on new cartridges.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> that card stock of that weight is listed.  </s>
<s> but to test if the printer has failed is hard on owners.  </s>
<s> we have to test it on another pc. if the printer has failed then we get a cost estimate and compare that to the replacement cost.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> gotcha.  </s>
<s> i've got a laptop around here somewhere i can test it on.  </s>
<s> never crossed my mind (where did i leave my mind anyway) to do that.  </s>
<s> thanks for the kick in the behind!  </s>
