i have bought office 2007 and downloaded it to my desk top, i have the back up disks and i want to put it onto my note book instead of having to buy another office suite. any ideas on how to do this since the note book doesnt have a dvd drawer? thanks
over the years i added an usb dvdrw drive to my collection. that's how i solved this. bob
...on more than one computer (student/home edition allows installation on up to three machines), then download office from microsoft directly onto netbook and use license number from your purchased disks to register it. that's how i got it onto my netbook.
i found that i was able to download my wife's office installation cd onto a 4gig jump drive from her desktop. i simply plugged the jump drive into her netbook and opened up the office installation software. of course, she has a legal version of office with the permission to use it on more than one of her computers. it all worked out just fine.
