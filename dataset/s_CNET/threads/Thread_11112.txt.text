i have a toshiba satellite m65-s809 laptop. it has the double laywer dvd writer, for whatever it means, i don't really know. haha. i just put in a maxell dvd+r rw, dvd in the slot, and i thought that i can just drag the files, and they will be copied to the new dvd. however, the computer tells that it is inaccessible? how come? did i buy the wrong dvd? thanks.
while cdburnerxp (google.com) is free and can erase and record files on said dvdrw, it's not drag and drop. however a multi-session dvdrw is a great idea and you can do it with this. xp's drag and drop does not support dvdrw. bob
hello. so i suppose that i need to check the laptop and see if it has a software that lets me do that? if not, is there any free software that i can download? thanks.
i noted cdburnerxp which will allow you to create safe, very compatible multi-session dvdrw disks. very compatible with other recording software so give it a spin first. bob
hello. i installed this cdburnerxp. but it didn't work after i selected all the files, and click on burn. it will pop up a window, and in a few seconds. the entire program will disappear from the screen as if i didn't open it at all. i did it last night, i thought that i did something wrong. so i did it again today, it is doing it again.
