<s> not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes.  </s>
<s> i have a dell dem.  </s>
<s> 8400 running xp pro wirh all the updates.  </s>
<s> when i go to burn jpgs.  </s>
<s> to dvd everything is fine until i click on make compatable.  </s>
<s> it starts then i get a blue stop screen.if  </s>
<s> i don't click make compatiable i can open the files on my computer but it does not work on others.  </s>
<s> if i remember correctly i did not have this problem a few months ago.  </s>
<s> i reinstalled my sonic software but that did not help.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> are you using some type of file cd/dvd, as in drag and drop, as in the disk is like a drive?  </s>
<s> if so, don't.  </s>
<s> it can be flaky and takes extra data/drivers to make the disk playable on other machines.  </s>
<s> i copy jpg images to dvd.  </s>
<s> everything works fine and i can open the files on the disk after burning.  </s>
<s> it's just when i click on &quot;make compatable&quot; it crashes the computer.  </s>
<s> that the dvd burner works just fine when burning slide shows from pro show gold.  </s>
<s> it's just a start but it means that you installed some other software to enable using the media as a big floppy.  </s>
<s> try this.  </s>
<s> uninstall that software and then reinstall this plus what updates they offer.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> what software that could be.  </s>
<s> what should i look for. the only thing i could find besides the sonic dla was power dvd5.5.  </s>
<s> could that be the one?  </s>
<s> dla is a form of formatting that enables the optical drive to work like a big hard drive or floppy disk.  </s>
<s> when you &quot;copy files&quot; to the optical drive you are burning them but they will only work on that pc. that &quot;make comatable&quot; option is supposed to make the optical disk compatable with other pcs.  </s>
<s> it's not.  </s>
<s> as bob said, uninstall it or use standard burning techniques.  </s>
<s> do you have a burning program?  </s>
<s> are there any programs you recomend?  </s>
<s> i'm a photographer and i need to put jpgs on a dvd to give out but i have to make sure that other computers will read the files.  </s>
<s> it's what i use.  </s>
<s> try download.com  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
