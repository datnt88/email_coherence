<s> i have an hp 533w with no os and no working cd drive.  </s>
<s> i need to have it working.  </s>
<s> because my money is going into remodeling my place, i will not be able to afford a new system for a little time.  </s>
<s> it has a working floppy drive and 384m of ram.  </s>
<s> there's dos but not much else.  </s>
<s> see freecycle on google and ask for someone to donate you a free cd drive.  </s>
<s> those type drives are worthless on the market when you find dvdrw drives on sale for 20 bucks.  </s>
<s> a cd drive is about what you need to get. its going to make reloading the os that much better and you'll need it anyways over time. the cost of a new cd drive is pretty cheap.  </s>
<s> if you can't do that a &quot;borrowed&quot; drive will do fine provided you have no cd issues.  </s>
<s> i have found used cd drives at the goodwill and sal.  </s>
<s> army outlets, just be sure you get a later model.  </s>
<s> you can contact or get the &quot;floppy version for xp&quot; if still available to load that way, but this is a very drawn out process.  </s>
<s> goto ms support and get the info about xp floppy install, but since you have hp or a provided oem version of xp(i suspect), its an open question.  </s>
<s> contact hp for any possible xp os disks to load, but again for a small cost if still provided.  </s>
<s> xp is in itself an os overshadowed by the vista os and hp may no longer provide certain support.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
