<s> i am using a hp pavilion 734n desktop and a lexmark x75 all-in-one.  </s>
<s> my os is win xp. on my old computer i was able to - using this same printer.  </s>
<s> i can print web pages and documents but not envelopes.  </s>
<s> can you help me?  </s>
<s> i can't help yet.  </s>
<s> you'll need to write more detail about your issue.  </s>
<s> for example, what happens when you try to print an envelope, error messages or is it some feeding problem with the printer.  </s>
<s> in short, your post is too light on details.  </s>

<s> i hear sounds like it is printing, but the envelope feeds out blank.  </s>
<s> no mention if you selected the envelope paper size in the printer dialog or what direction/side the printer you fed the envelope.  </s>
<s> i was hoping for a gritty blow by blow detail of how you tried to print on the envelope.  </s>
<s> here's a test i do when i wonder where/how/orientation to feed the envelope.  </s>
<s> i print, but instead i use a full size sheet.  </s>
<s> that way i can discern where to place the envelope.  </s>
<s> in closing, your post is much too short on words.  </s>
<s> make/model of what printers, the os, the applications and more would help the forum see what the problem could be. the following tip is presented with every post.  </s>
<s> i'll copy here in case you missed it.  </s>
<s> &quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot;  </s>
