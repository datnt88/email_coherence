i am new to computers so i need some help. does anyone know when i do a powerpoint presentation of only 4 slides do i copy it to cd or dvd. i have never used these two functions. so if someone can explian what i use these things for it would be appreciated.
with just 4 slides you should fit it on there easy. otherwise use a cdrom and just cut and paste. but you have to close it out or burn it (rendering the cd unusable for any other writing). then when you do your presentation, just double click on the cd (assuming powerpoint is loading on that computer).
so that whatever you do can be removed later and you can reuse your cd for other purpose, later..
i don't know what a memory stick is but i managed to burn it on cd thanks for your help
two links:   kees
also, i don't know about the new office, but with the old one office 97 they had a program where you could just play the slideshow on a computer that didn't have it loaded on it. a pretty small program too.
