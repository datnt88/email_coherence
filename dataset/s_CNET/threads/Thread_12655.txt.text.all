<s> i'm considering buying an ampe a10 quad core 10.1&quot; tablet pc. all the figures seem to be ok, but has anyone out there used one that can tell me if it's any good or not?  </s>
<s> why would i consider this over a name unit? the office is on a march to push some apps out and i have the nexus 7, kf hd7 and tomorrow an asus transformer arrives.  </s>
<s> looking forward to that as it's the one with the keyboard dock.  </s>
<s> yes the office got it on woot for a steal so it's not the one with the gorgeous ips display but for what we need to do, it's fine.  </s>

<s> not much of a premium and i see folk are installing jellybean!  </s>
