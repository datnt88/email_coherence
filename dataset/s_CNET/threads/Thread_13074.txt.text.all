i have lived in areas where power went out frequently, sometimes several times a day. 
it doesn't seem like it could be good to have the electricity going off suddenly without the usual system shutdown. 
any ideas about this? 
the previous message was supposed to be for the &quot;computer on/off&quot; debate. 
buy a good backup power unit. 
try apc backup ups.
