i'm looking to build a new powerhouse pc, and wanted some &quot;expert&quot; opinion on the part list and just double checking to make sure it is all compatible. cpu: intel
i read articles like  and see no water cooling. your list is so similar so it's a common list to make such from. bob
looks promising but you might also want to look at, unless you already have, gigabyte mb's, i've always had better luck with them than asus.
rest all things are preety good except power supply buy seasonic 850 platinum series power supply or corsair corsair ax 760i...this are very good with platinum certification.
