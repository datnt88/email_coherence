hi, i have a: hp pavilion dv6-1131ea and wanted to know if there would be any problems with adding a blu ray recorder to play movies and create backups?
might be pretty expensive to change the internal. . . have you priced them ? vapcmd
you have the choice of either ext. type drive or replacing the int. drive. if you plan to replace the int. drive it must be a match or actually fits and uses the same i/f as the old drive. so, be 100% sure it will work with your laptop model#. the quick and easy method is just buy an ext. drive that plugs into a usb port or esata if so equipped for ease of use. that's it, just use as any other drive. i do suggest you buy the &quot;kit&quot; form so everything is all present for use. tada -[-----willy
thanks for the replies. it was an internal drive i was looking for. the reason i asked was i seem to remember that the laptop or os needed a piece of built in software to enable you to play discs a bit like dvd software but hardcoded in. i was looking at this drive:  it seems cheap enough and does what i want
there is no free bluray player software. (this is true today and if anyone finds such, please share it. no, trials do not count!) this is why a bare drive may not do what you want. i've lost count of folk that get the drive then discover they need software. the sad part is if they had got the software with the drive, it would have been cheaper. bob
hi i already have nero 11 for the recording side and cyberlink powerdvd 11 for playback on my win 8 comp
at least you know what can be an issue. i'll not duplicate prior discussions about that title so be sure to ask how much to update to their latest. bob
