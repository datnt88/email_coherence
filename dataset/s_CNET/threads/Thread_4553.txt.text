i'm totally new to wireless networking so forgive me for my ignorance. i've come a long way in the past 2 weeks thanks to you guys. although i still have fears about security i'm sure they will subside as i become more knowlegdable. when i set up my wireless router i had belkin walk me through it without using the setup disk so i probably didn't learn anything. put my trust in them. so i honestly don't know where to begin to check my router settings although i was told, by belkin, that they set my security to the highest level. o.k,so i just bought the canon pixma mx860 and set it up myself with the setup disk and manual. everything went smoothly, plugged in the usb just in time, and install went fine. learning. my question is when i came to the part about wpa or wpa2. i chose wpa. should i worry? tia
at the top we give those suggestions. some hardware has issues with wpa2 so if you can use it without issue that's super. if not, just wpa is fine too. bob
these are all new devices sony laptop, belkin router, and canon printer. should i research on how they deal with wpa2 level of encryption? tired tonight, will spend some time in the next few days on how, where, and which device to change this setting if neccessary for better security. live in a condo development and i see several users some secure, some not. no expert at this stuff. thanks for your help. mike
here i go with our forum advice. some want to spend hours researching. bob
