1. are chassis fans to blow in or suck out air? 2. are cpu fans to blow or suck? i just replaced my fans and i am just making sure i put them in the right direction. thanks
this is typical, but yiu should have noted how *your fans* were ordinated. front chassis fans, blow-in, rear fans, blow-out. hsf, usually blow-on or down onto the cpu. however, if you have no directly mounted cpu fan, and is off or mounted elsewhere, usually that implies its trying to blow-out the chassis when connectewd to some sort of wind tunnel. when you look at fan blades themselves directly, they are usually blowing towards you. in better fans, a decal or embossed air shows the direction of flow. tada -----willy
1. chassis fans should be oriented to bring in outside air through the front (and sometimes the sides) and to expel component-heated warm air out the back (and sometimes the top). 2. cpu fans are generally oriented to force air downward over the hs to dissipate cpu heat. however there is at least one formerly prominent hs mfg (alphacool) that specified just the opposite for their units. 3. and it you look very carefully ...youll almost always find two arrows embossed on the outside of the fan showing the direction of fan rotation and direction of the airflow. heres a great link for more info about this subject  vapcmd
