(they installed the fan facing towards the graphics card, it was originally facing forward)  everything works fine but my new temperature is 48c idle and under stress occt it skyrockets to 70 degrees??? i called and the lady told me that she installed it correctly and used the right amount of thermal compound. is the 20 degrees difference because of the new cpu? or is it a bad cpu? i bought it off ebay used. or did fry's electronics did a bad installation? what should i do?
