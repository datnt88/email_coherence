<s> two years ago, i upgraded from a humongous crt to a lcd flat screen monitor.  </s>
<s> i came to cnet and reviewed a bunch.  </s>
<s> i've dealt with gateway in the past, had an account i could charge on, and decided to buy the fpd2185w.  </s>
<s> at the time it had good reviews wtih the editors here and it seemed like a good deal.  </s>
<s> so, i bought it.  </s>
<s> it was beautiful and the picture was great.  </s>
<s> now...two years later...it just died.  </s>
<s> i shut down one night and the next day it wouldn't turn on.  </s>
<s> i took my computer and monitor to a repair facility.  </s>
<s> they hooked up the monitor to a different computer but it still didn't turn on.  </s>
<s> decision: it is not working.  </s>
<s> and the facility i took it too didn't repair monitors.  </s>
<s> i came home and jumped on cnet and found that that particular monitor was a piece of junk.  </s>
<s> many, many people have had the same problems.  </s>
<s> and to top it all off, gateway's technical support (which was great in 2000) was rude and just not available.  </s>
<s> they would not stand behind their monitor.  </s>
<s> it was a year out of warranty.  </s>
<s> i will never ever buy from gateway again.  </s>
<s> and i suggest to anyone out there run far from gateway.  </s>
<s> there is a reason their business tanked.  </s>
<s> now i am going to buy a new monitor. the guys at the repair facility said buy univision and that costco has them.  </s>
<s> my experience with costco is great and they stand behind everything they sell.  </s>
<s> we've had great luck with them when a microwave died.  </s>
<s> so, i'm inclined to buy what they have.  </s>
<s> their concierge service is known to be great.  </s>
<s> so, what monitor do you guys out there suggest as far as dependability and after the sale service?  </s>
<s> i liked the 21&quot; but will consider a 19&quot; if it will last me longer than 2 years.  </s>
<s> not to be picking on you but really, &quot;would you honor a warranty that's 1 yr.  </s>
<s> out of date&quot;?  </s>
<s> most companies would pretty much give you the same answer, no. if you like verify any warranty policy on the next lcd monitor and if offered see if an &quot;extended warranty&quot; is worth your time and possible added cost.  </s>
<s> good luck tada -----willy  </s>
<s> well willy, you were being a bit nit-picky to have that answer.  </s>
<s> and it's obvious you have not shopped at costco.  </s>
<s> they stand behind their products even when they were out of warranty.  </s>
<s> many of our friends, as well as myself, have taken things back that were way out of warranty and they covered them fully.  </s>
<s> go back under your rock and quit picking on people on the message boards just because you have too much time on your hands.  </s>
<s> your response was annoying and not at all helpful.  </s>
<s> i wanted monitor information, not your snippy remarks.  </s>
