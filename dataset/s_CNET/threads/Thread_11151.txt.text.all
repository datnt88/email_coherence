<s> if any of those nero softwares is oem and you have multiple recorders i've found i need to uninstall nero and go get the retail version.  </s>
<s> i had tried differnce windows on the dvd and tried other nero programs nero 8 and orginal nero 7 and nero 6 and the nero i am currntly using is nero 7 that came with the new dvd any other help please and thank you  </s>
<s> that sounds very expensive.  </s>
<s> why would you not just buy that latest retail version?  </s>
<s> keep in mind that nero doesn't work with all drives or media types.  </s>
<s> i dropped a hint earlier about the log containing more clues but let me try blunt!  </s>
<s> 1. what make of the media that fails?  </s>
<s> 2. what firmware version for each drive make and model too please?  </s>
<s> nero 7 came with the dvd and a ferind had nero 8 so i setup it and i had nero 6 with the old writer and both of the writers was working on nero very good and the cd rw i had updated it's fireware any way i even had 2 windows they both don't work in both windows windows vista ultimate and xp and i had tried other windows xp an windows vista even windows xp pro and home edtiom and vista ultimate and vista home and they didn't work pease help i can return back the dvd but the old one i need to fix it  </s>
<s> the updating of firmware is a well known way to kill off the ability to use the oem versions of nero.  </s>
<s> you now know why this happens.  </s>
<s> -&gt; the only fix i've found is to go back or scrub the drive clean of any sign of nero then install their latest retail version.  </s>
<s> any oem version may not do here.  </s>
<s> thanks for the final clue.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i had updated the cd rw but the dvd still with the orginal fireware what can i do about the dvd ?  </s>
<s> this is the bane of the oem versions.  </s>
<s> they seem to do odd things when firmware or drive change.  </s>
<s> glad we've found it.  </s>
<s> since you don't have the full retail copy look to freeware dvd and other creation/burning programs.  </s>
