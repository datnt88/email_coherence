i have a fairly new computer (close to 2 years) and i want to upgrade my processor. i just hope this is the only thing i have to upgrade, heh. i'm not sure what will affect what. my current setup is: athlon 1800+(or 1700 i forget, how can i check?) gigabyte athlon/duron compatible motherboard pny geforce 4 4400 256 mb ram 400 watt antec power supply creative audigy soundcard windows 98se i want to upgrade the processor and ram. is it possible for me to install 2200/2400 amd on the same motherboard? and is another 256 of memory not over-doing it? i know i have enough memory slots? thanks for any help recieved. ps. cheapest place to buy hardware/cases?
it's this simple... 1. find the make/model of your &quot;gigabyte athlon/duron compatible motherboard&quot;, go to the web site and check out their manuals or web pages on that motherboard to see what cpu's will fit. 2. 256 is usually enough, but gamers will want the 512mb for 98. be aware that this will not increase the fixed space 64 thousand byte memory pools called resources. the memory article at  will tell you about that. bob
visit the mtrbd. support website for two things; the latest tech. specs. and any bios updates which should allow the greatest selection for the newer cpus. as for memory, that should be a easy one, just buy the same type of ram module and install, that is unless you got some weird setup. offhand, i say you can upgrade the cpu at least to amd2200-xp type. again, the bios update *may* allow better cpu installs. etc. just be sure to know what any bios update does. always backup before the update and follow the instructions exactly, you have 1-chance to succeed. also, use the manual bios update process, don't try the &quot;online&quot; process its more open to possible glitches. good luck -----willy
