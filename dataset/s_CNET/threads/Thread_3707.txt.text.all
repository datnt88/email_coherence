<s> system: dell, dimension 2400 - windows 2000 in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, there was an icon (like that for the usb port -&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;) that was a picture if a camera (for my digital camera).  </s>
<s> i clicked on it (like you would to stop the usb port) so i could unplug it.  </s>
<s> i clicked on &quot;disable&quot;, i guess that was the wrong choice because now when i plug in my camera it doesn't recognize that there's anything there. the icon for the usb port is there (&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;), but i can't access my g: drive (removable driver) from my computer or the desktop shortcut.  </s>
<s> what do i to undo what i did!!!!!!! would greatly appreciate any help  </s>
<s> some software that came with the camera you might try opening the program and see if there are any tools or settings tabs that might offer that.  </s>
<s> i'm not at all familiar with win 2000 but if it has the ability to restore back to an earlier date that may bring it back.  </s>
<s> if no luck post back.  </s>
<s> i have 2000, you didn't reveal brand of your camera, you did say you could still see that icon.  </s>
<s> i fix my own troubles by trial and error, if i had that problem, i would right click in that icon, look-see if you get a place to &quot;enable&quot;.  </s>
<s> if you see &quot;enable&quot; you won't hurt anything to click on it, if &quot;enable&quot; is not there, you can get out of there by placing the cursor pointer out in the open on the desktop, and left click.  </s>
<s> and you still have done no harm.  </s>
<s> if you get it fixed, please post back.  </s>
