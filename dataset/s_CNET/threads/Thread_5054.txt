2922	3	405013	3355363	3354210	anuocto14	8/10/10 12:56 pm	1.28144496e12	i think my system is never gonna work perfectly fine	same sys specs as i stated above. i got this zotac gt 240 1 gb ddr5 installed it properly with newest recommended driver 258.96 from nvidia website. i didn't get any problem with graphics for 2 days....though i got some small blue pink like boxes while opening windows firewall....restarted the system and it didn't came after that. but on third day which means few hours before i posted this problem....i started having a strange problem. i play video, be it using any media player, but the computer freezes randomly after doing that. this is what happens(while playing any video only)- sometimes it plays flawlessly sometimes it freezes in the middle for about 2-3(damn) mins and then gets normal. sometimes it freezes then recovers and plays only audio while the video is completely blank. once the system froze, i restarted it and after welcome screen it showed only blue artifacts and boxes having color tones like we see on welcome screen only it takes a lot of time to close any media player from the task manager, system freezes while doing that. sometimes the media player process keeps running, though i had closed it normally by hitting quit button, and at that time system performance shoots up to 50 percent or above. i googled this problem and some of them got this problem but don't seem to find any possible cause other than changing the card(though it didn't worked either for some of them) is there any problem with the card or do i need to update any other thing...like bios...if it could be a bios issue....guide me how to update it. if it doesn't seem that then help me out please!!!

2922	5	405013	3355373	3355366	anuocto14	8/10/10 1:20 pm	1.2814464e12	so what's the suggestion then	i had tested my ram with memtest and also installed and checked them individually...came out with no errors some 8-9 months ago i had replaced my previous card 8400 gs...then they had applied the compound on the heat sink and also updated the bios should i do that again? i mean checking the thermal grease and updating the bios?

2922	7	405013	3355381	3355375	anuocto14	8/10/10 1:37 pm	1.28144742e12	well this is the story	my previous 8400 gs started working badly and showed jagged lines....this happened some 9 months ago i replaced that 8400 gs card with a new but same model...then &quot;they&quot; means computer hardware technicians at xfx service centre had applied the thermal grease and also updated the bios. and the reason i'm using 2 sticks is that i have 1tb hdd...as the system was giving slower performance with 2 gb...the computer technician at my workplace suggested me to upgrade it to 4 gb....and to utilize 4 gb mem completely i had to install windows xp sp2 64 bit and now this problem after getting gt 240.

2922	9	405013	3356670	3355393	anuocto14	8/12/10 12:30 pm	1.2816162e12	but	i googled this issue and most of the windows 7 users are facing the same problem.....most of them are facing this while playing game. so we can't say it can be an os problem

2922	14	405013	3358679	3357726	anuocto14	8/16/10 10:33 am	1.28195478e12	checked the bios version	i ran dxdiag no problems found so directx is clear i checked the bios version it's 1404, date 10/92007 it could be old bios problem also then. how latest bios do i need to run gt240...or even 84000gs?
2922	15	405013	3359026	3357726	anuocto14	8/16/10 8:47 pm	1.28199162e12	please reply	how latest version of the bios do i need for cards like 9800gt or gt 240?
