i'm looking to upgrade my current system, but i only have $1,400 available to complete the task. i'm looking to upgrade the basics if i can get away with it for now. example the cpu, motherboard, ram, case, and power supply. i am running a agp graphics card right now as well, and if figure i might have to upgrade that as well. plus i also want to stick with windows xp if i can, i realize that i will have to buy a new copy xp when doing this, and so that cost i have factored out. so the remaining amount is the above number. if someone could help me out that would be great. thanks.
you don't state what you are running now or what you would like the upgraded system to be able to handle. for example, do you play a lot of games, do photo editing, or just want a basic system for surfing the net and home office uses? if you upgrade the motherboard, cpu, case, ram and power supply, how is that not a new system or darn near it? for example, you could look on extremetech's $800 build it yourself gaming system and then pick which parts to upgrade to fit your budget and wants. regards, jb
