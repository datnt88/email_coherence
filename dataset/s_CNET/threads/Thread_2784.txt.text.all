<s> hi, i have an asus a7n8x-la, it is capable of 2gb ddr2 pc2700.. but i own an compaq presario s3190uk, pc with this motherboard and it is limited to 1gb.  </s>
<s> can i do something to add more memory, maybe via the bios or can i override somehow.  </s>
<s> thanks for any help you guys can give me or if you can point me in the right direction or if im stuck, thanks anyhow.  </s>
<s> the system limit is the system limit...without regard to an os. vapcmd  </s>
<s> exceeding what crucial.com offers or the maker requires skills that those that can do, would never ask here.  </s>
<s> no offense intended but stick to the specs so you save your money for the next rig.  </s>
