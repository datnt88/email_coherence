hey guys, i really need help on choosing the right gaming pc in time for christmas-ish. this will be the first gaming pc though i am a devout gamer, consoles mainly until my friend introduced me to the world of pc gaming so this is the first time i have ever bought one so be gentle with me. i'm looking around for a good pc that runs the latest games and is going to be future proof for a number of years. i have a budget of around &#163;1000 though i may be able to go up and down a little bearing in mind that i have got to buy a monitor and keyboard etc (using a laptop at the moment). i have been snooping around and the amount of choices are insane. so essentially what i would really like is advice on graphics cards, processors and the likes and what i could get for most bang for my buck. recommendations are welcome whether it be desktops or sites but i have no intention of building my own i'm afraid. thanks
any dual core cpu is about all we need. 4 or more gb ram and then the all important video card. i have a list i really like. here it is -&gt;  frankly any card above the 101 usd line is going to rock compared to most off the shelf desktops. bob
why go with a dual core, when you can get an i3 quad core for another hundred dollars or so. a dual core may work just fine, but the op was requesting a machine that wouldn't be horribly outdated for a couple years or so. my advice would be to look for an intel i5 quad core. you will notice a difference in performance between the two.
do you have some online shopping sites in the uk that you would consider buying a pre-built pc from? do share them here and we'll be happy to help you pick the right system for your gaming needs.
sorry about late reply haven't had the time to check emails properly in ages. err i was looking at overclockers.co.uk i don't really know any others.
