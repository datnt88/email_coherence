<s> i'm considering buying a netbook that comes with windows 7 starter.  </s>
<s> i checked microsoft's &quot;check-list&quot; to compare starter to windows 7 home premium.  </s>
<s> it seems to me starter edition would simply eliminate much of the &quot;fluff&quot; and not much that would be really missed.  </s>
<s> can anybody say what reasons one may be disatisfied with starter on a netbook?  </s>
<s> some folk have put one item or another on a stick to parade around that 7 starter is garbage.  </s>
<s> things like the wallpaper.  </s>
<s> ok, let me share i pushed a little netbook to the edge and it did fine.  </s>
<s> here's what we setup.  </s>
<s> it's advanced so here goes.  </s>
<s> visual studio 2008 for windows mobile development.  </s>
<s> we ran the debugger over usb &quot;plus&quot; we installed mobiler for remote control.  </s>
<s> no speed demon but what proof you can do a lot with starter?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yes, when i searched this forum to see if my question had already been answered, i saw your posted test results.  </s>
<s> i realize there's only so much performance you can expect in these little computers- that's understood.  </s>
<s> but for normal usage that a netbook is intended for, my only concern is if there are important features left off starter.  </s>
<s> i don't consider aero and &quot;shake&quot; important.  </s>
<s> some take the wallpaper item, put it on a stick to parade around as proof.  </s>
<s> here even bluetooth works without any driver hunt.  </s>
<s> i only have 2 adapters but they plug in and just work.  </s>
<s> this is super nice.  </s>
<s> --&gt;&gt; another rant we see is the missed dvdrw drive.  </s>
<s> but this is an optional item that you decide on.  </s>
<s> ---&gt;&gt;&gt; and then we have the problem of how to restore the os when folks or malware kills it.  </s>
<s> you'll see rants about how they feel entitled to the dvdrw drive because you can't load the os without one.  </s>
<s> i don't know how to respond to those.  </s>
<s> ok, normal usage.  </s>
<s> a netbook is not a laptop and should never sub for one.  </s>
<s> you might understand this if you used one for a few hours.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> so i can assume windows 7 starter edition isn't missing anything included in home premium that's very important?  </s>
<s> as for a $300 netbook, it's performance limitations are obvious and should be accepted for what it is.  </s>
<s> so how would you re-install the os, if necessary?  </s>
<s> pretty simple.  </s>
<s> i use the usual usb dvdrw drive and the restore media.  </s>
<s> some opt out then start a rant about it should be included because its required to restore the machine.  </s>
<s> again i don't handle that rant well.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ok, i wasn't sure if you could boot from an external cd/dvd drive.  </s>
<s> didn't know if it would just show as a &quot;removable storage&quot; usb.  </s>
<s> i think i'm all set.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
