i have a funai wd5b-n8480zb machine which can dub my old videos on to dvd's. in the manual it says that 5 recording speeds are possible, but, after carefully perusing the whole manual from end to end, nowhere does it tell how to do this! does anyone know? gthanks gerald
but it's possible they didn't document it and expect the owner to explore all the menus. bob
they all have a &quot;rec mode&quot; button on the remote that sets the recording speed. take a look at that.
actually, i had explored the menus with no success, but ahtoi had the answer. there is, indeed a button on the remote setting th recording speed. thanks for the tip.
