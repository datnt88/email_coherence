2983	5	269897	2621002	2620756	indy2001	11/2/07 7:40 pm	1.1940324e12	dumb mistake	yeah, sorry. i meant to use gb instead of mb. and i forgot to add that i wouldn't recommend that last gb unless you can get it free, or at least really cheap! getting only 1/4 of what you pay for isn't much of a deal. i haven't removed the 4th ram memory unit, but i'd bet there wouldn't be a noticeable difference between 3 gb and 4 gb.

2983	7	269897	2622558	2620756	rabbblerouser	11/5/07 5:20 am	1.19424e12	re:	the 4gb limit on 32bit machines includes your ram, video ram and your virtual memory. the .75 missing is prob 256 for your video and 512 virtual memory.
