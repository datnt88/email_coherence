i've got a maxtor onetouch ii 200gig external hdd that i would like to partition. all the harddrives in my computers are partitioned, but i ahve never partitioned an external drive before. has anyone tried?? u think it is a good idea??
you can partion it the same way you did your internal drives. john
why would you want to partition it to begin with???? drives today don't need it. partitioning went out a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
