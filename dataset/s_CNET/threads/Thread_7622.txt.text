my linksys wrt54gc (version2) model router frequently stops wireless broadcasting and i have to unplug and replug the power cable to connect again. after some time, it again suddenly stops wireless broadcast until it's repowered. i've been having this problem for over 2 weeks now and tried the latest firmware upgrade and resetted the router for countless times but couldn't solve the problem. anyone, has experience in this issue, has any reccomendation ?
sounds like the transmitter is failing. warranty? use it.
i'm afraid warranty period is expired =( is there any other reccomendation ?
update the firmware and keep the settings simple. no mac filters, use wpa and don't hide that ssid. and let the air get to all six sides. bob
as i mention in the first post: tried the latest firmware upgrade and resetted the router for countless times and configurations but couldn't solve the problem.
my answers are mostly repeats. i will not edit them to fit exactly. resets are ok but notice you didn't reveal your settings. those that use no or wep security often have your complaints. bob
