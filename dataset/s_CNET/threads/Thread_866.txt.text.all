<s> alright, i'm building my firsy system, but i have been researching the crap out of all of my parts, so i have it down to the model number on everything except for the graphics card.  </s>
<s> i am a college student, so budget is important, but i have a decent amount of money to play around with.  </s>
<s> here is the rig: athlon 64 3500+ socket 939 asus a8n-e motherboard (not looking for sli) 1 gb ocz ddr-400 performance enhanced latency at 2-3-2-6 250 gb hitachi deskstar 7200rpm sata 3.0gb/s hard drive cooler master praetorian case antec neopower 480w power supply lite-on dvd burner i wanted to spend about $300 on a video card.  </s>
<s> so far as i can tell, the cards i would get the most out of with my set up are: radeon x800xl 256, geforce 6800 gt or any other cards around that range.  </s>
<s> now, if i buck the extra 50 bucks to go up to a radeon x850xt, will it be worth it in terms of performance?  </s>
<s> another question is with the amount i want to spend on a video card (not $400+ for something like a 7800) would i be better off lowering my cpu to an athlon 64 3000+ and just going for the 400-500 dollar card? the goal here is being able to play any new games that come out on damn good video settings, like f.e.a.r. and call of duty 2. doom 3 and halflife 2 are afterthoughts to me, so they should be able to be played with zero problem.  </s>
<s> so dont buy ati. the 6800gt would be great.  </s>
<s> i'm a little wary of getting a 6800gt.  </s>
<s> i keep reading reviews on newegg for several different manufacturers and it seems people either say it performs great, or they say they have a ton of problems with it, there isn't a lot of middle ground.  </s>
<s> cooling these things seems to be an issue too, and while i won't have a problem putting on an aftermarket cooler, i don't exactly want to do that, then have the card crap out, then be stuck with no video card due to voiding my warranty!  </s>
<s> i can't afford it.  </s>
<s> i might go with a 7800  </s>
