<s> i installed a new motherboard in a system with a 2.0 ghz p4 running winxp sp2.  </s>
<s> now when i try to boot the system, it continually comes to the screen asking for boot type; start normally, safe mode, last known good config, etc. no matter which option i choose, the system restarts and returns to this screen.  </s>
<s> any help will be greatly appreciated thanks....jedichef  </s>
<s> then your pc is not the problem.  </s>
<s> xp will not let you install a new mb an boot right away.  </s>
<s> this is it's behavior when it sees itself on a new pc.  </s>
<s> you will probably need to do a repair installation of the os and reactivate it.  </s>
<s> a repair installation does not (usually) cause data loss.  </s>
<s> you also cannot just put the old mb back now to back things up.  </s>
<s> go for the repair installation and reactivate the os.  </s>
<s> i really hoped i wouldn't have to do that.  </s>
<s> but in the end, it wasn't that painful.  </s>
<s> i didn't seem to lose any programs as with a normal reinstall.  </s>
<s> it appears i have to update xp but that's a piece of cake.  </s>
<s> thanks again chef  </s>
