is a intel celeron d a ok processor for a low end gaming computer, i think i might have heard that somewere. 
i wouldn't recommend a celeron d for a gaming box. 
here's a representative benchmark... google for more: if your budget only allows $100 for a cpu and you're going with intel, then celeron d is your only option. 
up your budget to $140 and get a pentium d 805 (2.6ghz dual core). 
good luck vapcmd
