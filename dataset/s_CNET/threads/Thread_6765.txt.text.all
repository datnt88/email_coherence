<s> i installed windows 98 once, and it didn't work.  </s>
<s> anyway, i was able to start up in safe mode, and i had something like 5.8 gb of space on that computer's hard drive.  </s>
<s> i decided to re-install.  </s>
<s> i made a boot disk, and typed fdisk to re-partion my hard drive.  </s>
<s> i deleted by old partitions, and made a new one.  </s>
<s> when it asked if i wanted to use the maximum space for my partion, i hit yes. it said 508 mb. i figured something was wrong, so i restarted, and did the process of fdisk over.  </s>
<s> this time, instead of clicking yes to the maximum, i just set the value of space to be used on the partion i wanted (in percent) to 99%. it came out as like 500 mb.  </s>
<s> what happened!? it's like my hard drive was randomly reduced to 1/10 the size!  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> my first thought was that the hard drive was shot, but i later proceeded to install windows 98 on it, so i fail to see how only 90% of it was ruined... any suggestions as to where to go would be helpful.  </s>
<s> thanks, garciaowens by the way, i'm 100% sure that my hard drive -was- very near 6 gb, so it's not just be seeing things or something.  </s>
<s> 4 years late but i just got vista and it does this too, but it goes bak up like it goes 17.2gb 17.0gb 16.7gb down to like 11gb then jumps to 19gb  </s>
<s> have you looked in the bios to see what is detected as the hard drive?  </s>
<s> depending on that, how old is the computer?  </s>
<s> some really old computers cannot handle large hard drives.  </s>
<s> did you click yes to having large drive support?  </s>
<s> if you didn't then you are limited to fat 16- 2 gb.  </s>
<s> there was also an update to fdisk.  </s>
<s> even if you downloaded that it did not automatically insert the new version into the file that makes the boot floppy.  </s>
<s> you must do that manually, either on the floppy as just for that floppy or in explorer to replace the old fdisk that is in the boot disk file.  </s>
<s> for large drives the fdisk works just fine, however then the format reports the incorrect size, however if you proceed it actually formats the drive correctly.  </s>
