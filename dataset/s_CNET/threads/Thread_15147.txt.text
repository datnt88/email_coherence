purchased a usb powered extension some time ago. did not try it immediately as i didn't need it. finally decided to try it and i get an error message stating &quot;usb device not recognized&quot; &quot;one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned&quot;. i have tried the cable on two laptops and two desktops; operating systems ranging from the current windows 7; vista and windows xp. all with the same results. going into device manager on the xp system; it tells my that there is an &quot;unknown device&quot; and that there are no drivers installed for it. did extensive research on the web; and every where it says that no drivers are required for a powered usb cable. any suggestions or alternatives. have had the cable to long to return it; so that is out!
so all i can do is ask if there is a detail available like that. how long a cable is needed?
it is a 5m standard usb powered cable. male connection on one end female on the powered end. no make or model!
go get another one. i too see no drivers and there is nothing in your post that suggests it's your machines.
me thinks that is what i will have to do. just got to figure out what i can do with 15 ft. of usb cable!!!
and you would have to be perfect. i use a 10 foot extension cable and it is just wires. well, a good gauge and twisted like the &quot;spec&quot; but it does work except for usb hard drives which we do expect to fail on such things. bob
since the cable is powered, pnp is trying to install drivers for the attached device. what device did you attach that failed to install or did you just leave it open ended?
it fails when it is left open. i have tried it with a memory stick attached and got the same results.
