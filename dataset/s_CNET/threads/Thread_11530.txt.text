just received my new deminsion 5100. everything set-up just fine (or so i thought. hopped out to the inet and the entire system shut down. power off then power on produced nothing. i disconnected everything - powered off and then on - nothing. receiving power, fans working and that's it. the dvd writer doesn't seem to be receiving power however. i've called dell and am waiting on a fix. thought someone here might shed some insight. could there a be a relationship with the dvd burner?
since it's under warranty, it's best to let dell repair or replace it.
would be waiting on the phone for an answer if it's a new machine. either that or getting a rma#.
