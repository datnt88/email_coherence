when i push the power button fans barely move and then nothing. i have tested the power supply with volt meter and all have proper voltage. i even changed out power supply with a spare same problem. i then started disconecting power plugs and found the four pin 12 volt plug on the mother board is the problem. with the 4 pin plug disconected the computer will try to power up. i am then thinking mother board or processor. i took the processor out and computer now trys to power up with the 4 pin connected. i ordered a used processor on ebay put it in and the same problem. the computer is 5 years old and i don't want to spend the money on a mother board if i am off base. any advice would be appreciated. thank you.
it's a common issue with that old a pc. google the issue for pictures and more. bob
often enough as robert mentioned, &quot;bad caps&quot; are a problem especially with these smaller form pcs. that also includes the psu itself. i have reseated several times the connections and that helps if not a bad cap problem as the cabling can be pinched at odd places,e tc.. if a bad cable, replace until found. if you do in fact find a bad cap or mtrbd. itself, you should consider moving away from it, only a mtrbd. replacement works(fixed) because of old age, etc.. ebay for a working replacement mtrbd. if so inlcined. tada -----willy
