hi there, i am thinking of buying an old pii 133 laptop, (i will probably install win98 on it) but it doesn't have usb port so i am wondering, to xfer various files larger than 1.4 mb, can i hook this thing up to my win 2000 machine via a parallel cable? and if so, what do i need beyond the cable itself? will windows just start talking back and forth or do i need some software? speed is not a big issue here --fj ps it has a &quot;irda 1.0&quot; port, whatever that is - fj

the best s/w to do this is called, &quot;laplink&quot; which also includes the cable. older laplink s/w ver. will do fine, it seems too many bells and whisltes are part of the s/w now and but check to be sure it will handle your os. win98 and above offer ms own &quot;dcc&quot; s/w whcih does basically the same thing but very basic and that's ok for most users. that's installed from the os install cd from the add/remove s/w icon. you still need the laplink type cable parallel or serial links as required. the irda is &quot;infared connection&quot; ability. that's also possible if goping that route, but it can be complex at times. good luck -----willy
