<s> hello everyone.  </s>
<s> i don't know much about internet/wireless setups, so i would really appreciate any help with my issue.  </s>
<s> i recently moved to japan where my internet provider (yahoo bb adsl through softbank) makes me pay around $15(usd) extra a month for the privilege of having a wireless connection. the router they set my connection up with is not wireless, so they basically have me rent a wireless card (i'm not sure if that is the term) which connects into the router from them.  </s>
<s> i don't know what the card is called or if i can purchase one myself so i can save the $15 extra a month.  </s>
<s> is there something else (maybe a usb thing) i can connect to the router to have a wireless signal?  </s>
<s> if i buy my own wireless router could i replace theirs with it and still have my internet work?  </s>
<s> sorry for my ignorance, and thank you for any help.  </s>
<s> not just for internet access. the $15 is not for the card alone but for card and wi-fi service.  </s>
<s> are you able to access the internet through hardwire connection for no extra charge?  </s>
<s> replacing their adsl modem router seems to be too hard on owners.  </s>
<s> but i have used routers as a wap when i needed to add wifi.  </s>
<s> google this -&gt; how to use a router as a wap?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> if i don't pay the $15 extra i have to connect to the modem with via an ethernet cable to get internet.  </s>
<s> isn't wifi service just being able to use the internet wirelessly?  </s>
<s> so i would need to connect a wireless router to my existing router?  </s>
<s> should have answered that.  </s>
<s> it's a common setup.  </s>
<s> if that's not what you wanted to do, just add more details about what your goal was.  </s>

<s> thanks for your help  </s>
