<s> 1. nothing is plugged into any other jack in the apartment, and there is no alarm system 2. no torrent use 3. i need to use wifi and don't have a ethernet cable to test this out at the moment.  </s>
<s> i read somewhere that sometimes it can mess up if it is maxing out bandwidth.  </s>
<s> how can i limit the bandwidth for downloads to test this out?  </s>
<s> but my last idea is to get the ethernet for a test as well as secure your connection to wpa as well as change the rf channel. the uncanceled echo is still an nagging item.  </s>
<s> since it can't hurt, plug two filters into nearby phone jacks.  </s>
<s> this will change the line impedance and let's see what happens.  </s>
