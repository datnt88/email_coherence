this might be a dumb question, but here goes. i have a geforce fx 5500 video card that fit in my old motherboard's agp slot. now my new motherboard doesn't have a agp slot only, pci and pci express. the problem is that the fx5500 doesn't physically fit into the pci slots, it's too long. i planning on buying a new video card for the new motherboard, but how will i know what card will physically fit into the slots?
why not buy a pci express video card? there are numerous to choose from.
that's what i was plannin on getting, but will all pcie cards fit in all pcie slots?
just make sure it is pci express x16 gfx card. there are some that can fit in pci express x1 made by matrox.
if you could tell us that, we could get you a perfect match for your motherboard..
hi, i found this thread while trying to figure out what graphics card to use to upgrade my daughter's computer. the mother board is dfi am75-ec/tc rev. a+ and the current card is prosavage 8m which has really limited capabilities. do i purchase an agp or pci card? thank you, toni
i believe you have an agp 4.0 slot. agp is better, so get an agp slot. look in the user manual to verify its an agp slot. i only looked at the online manual, so i dk if its the same motherboard. roger
thank you for your help. i checked and it does have a 4x agp slot. i really appreciate you taking the time to respond. toni
