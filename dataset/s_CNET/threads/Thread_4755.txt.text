from audio cd's, youtube, etc. not necessarily in terms of games.
practically any card can handle cd-audio nowadays and likewise, youtube and streaming music audio isn't as good as cd-audio. so for those audio sources, there's not much difference. if you're using audio rates of 96khz+ or need lots of simultaneous voices or digital signal processing, then you'll need a better card and which card depends on your use.
almost all desktop machines had an analog output right on the cd/dvd player which you can run to your audio card. this skips all the conversion steps and you can listen directly to your audiocds. the creative cards are nice. but try what you have first. bob
