i have read that generic cards' fans make more noise or that they may fail??? among generics which would be the best options??? thanks
generic is equal if not better than the brand name!
define generic... so ure sayin sapphire, evga, leadtek, powercolor, bfg, asus, gigabyte, msi,visiontek, xfx are generic cuz their cards arent made by nvidia or ati? nvidia or ati dont make cards they only make the core. gfx card made by ati technologies are made by sapphire. so i guess u aint buyin no new gfx card as they are all &quot;generic&quot;
