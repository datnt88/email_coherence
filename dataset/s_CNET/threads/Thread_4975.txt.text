i have a dell dimension 1100 desktop computer and a panasonic viera tv (model tx-32lxd69a), which is lcd. i want to connect the processor to the tv, so that i can watch movies and tv programmes streamed through my computer on my tv screen. could i do this by using a hdmi cable to hdb15? see link below for details of cable.
not one of those cables (there are 3 at that link) convert from one thing to another. the manual i fetched from  makes no mention of vga support. bob
thanks for your reply, r. proffit. unfortunately, i don't understand what vga support means. there's a hdmi socket at the back of the tv. at present i have a hdmi cable attached from this socket to a blu ray player. i should have wrote in my post that i want to connect my pc to my tv.
you try the hdmi cable you have and if that works, you are done. i looked for pc details and can't find them so i went to check the tv and found no vga support so again, a dead end. bob
i've given up on connecting my pc to my tv. i'll do this when i upgrade my computer.
if you want to you hdmi then get a video card that has hdmi port. from what i gather on this thread that's what you're left with. if there is some adapter, it may not be as cheap or as ready as a video card with the hdmi port. don't make this complicated at least that's the direction i'll go. if you plan to buy another pc, the new video card would be cheaper. i suggest a ati 4350 or similar. tada -----willy
