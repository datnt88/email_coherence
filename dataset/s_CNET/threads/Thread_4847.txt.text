i wanna connect 10meter usb extender to a 4ports usb hub. but it is not working because it said unknown device. it shows &quot;windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (code 43)&quot;. it is working fine if connecting 10meter usb extender to a mouse or keyboard. it just can't connect to a usb hub. so is the power problem of the usb hub or i can't connect extender to hub?
usb is not a long distance system. try shorter usb 2.0 cables. bob
my old idea is pc &gt; usb extender &gt; usb hub &gt; mouse and keyboard (fail) now i try pc &gt; double usb extender &gt; mouse and keyboard will it fail cause by not enough power?
mice and keyboards are so far, very low power things. bob
the wireless usb hub plug in to a regular electric outlet where ever you need the keyboard/mouse/etc., this solves the distance/power issues. the computer can be in the other room and sends all usb activity wirelessly. visit this link  or do a search for &quot;wireless usb hub&quot; best of luck!
as your problem is that the usb extender is not working over the distance of 10 meter i think the best option would be to use the usb 2.0 extender which works on the usb 2.0 protocol .
