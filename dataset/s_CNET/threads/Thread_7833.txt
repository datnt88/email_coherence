686	4	184483	2009722	2009649	xyrauchen	6/17/06 9:26 am	1.15053636e12	thanks for your help	sorry i've been vague. am very embarrassed i don't know what i'm doing. i have checked to ensure my monitor is plugged into an electrical outlet and is securely attached from the monitor to computer (i've attached blue to blue and it appears there is only one place to plug into my pc). i have also checked my pc. it is plugged from the pc into an outlet. the keyboard and mouse are also secured into the pc. i will need to go back to my home to find the type of computer i have, etc. the only thing i know at this time is that it is a dell, desktop, about 4 years old, and runs windows xp. i have no clue if this info is helpful. i'll keep providing info as you ask. thanks, again. c
