i have a 3.6ghz pentium 4. yet in my device driver properties i'm showing two processors. is that hyperthreading?
page down to the hyperthreading entry. you can find more at the wikipedia so i'll end here. bob
most of the prescotts p4 above 3.0ghz are with ht, you can get this two processor wid a dual core too. but in amd u get 4 processors, 2 dualcore and 2 ht, evn in the extreme intel dual core processor i think so u get 4processors
