hi, can somebody help me please, i have a toshiba px1265se-1g16 external hard drive, it has onspec regen in stalled on what i think is a virtual drive, the only problem is is that when i enter the password for the drive, it says that the drive is enabled but when i go to my computer, it is only showing up as a cd drive with only 19.7 mb. the drive itself is 200gb. i have loads of pictures and files on there which i do not want to loose. can anybody help? is there a way of removing the virtual cd drive, thus allowing me access to my files? i am running windows 7 on a samsung nc10. thank you.
it's their software and if they fail, then the next call is to  -&gt; all externals fail like this. these are not &quot;storage&quot; but temporary copies which we must backup. for those that don't backup because it costs too much, just wait till they see the data recovery bills. bob
i appreciate the advice, but i don't think it's a hardware issue, i just think that either the mbr or virtual drive has become corrupt. i cannot delete anything as it will not give me access, it says it's a network drive. any ideas???? thanks again. matt
the problem is that this virtual drive is non-standard. if you use some non-standard feature then you need to ask toshiba how to recover. at the top of this forum are the usual titles to try but if you value your files i must stick to my original advice. bob
managed to find a piece of software called cd to hdd converter. it converts to a hdd again, but you will have to then use a file recovery software to get back your files because it formats (quick) you hdd.
my bet is they get that call too often and may have a fix that does not create the need for file recovery. -&gt; but this is the lesson that these drives are not storage. we must have a backup copy of what we can't lose. bob
