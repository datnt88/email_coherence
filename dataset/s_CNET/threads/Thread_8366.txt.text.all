<s> hiya. i don't know if i can post links, but i was considering buying that.  </s>
<s> right now i have 250w. the couple things i'm curious about, is if that is a psu, 'cuz it seems very cheap (or maybe i'm underestimating them), and how i would install it, when in fact it does come (if that's just something that's on the dell manual, those things are really hard to read).  </s>
<s> i have a dell dimension e310.  </s>
<s> sorry if my question is jumbled, thank you in advance.  </s>
<s> you get what you pay for and $20 ain't much for a 600w power supply.  </s>
<s> your e310 uses a standard atx power supply (no funky dell processor connector necessary).  </s>
<s> here's the cheapest power supply i would recommend: coolermaster 500w, $40:  </s>
<s> thank you very much.  </s>
<s> =) so i purchase this, it'll like... 90% work with my system?  </s>
<s> i figure i'll get a friend to install it for me.  </s>
<s> replacing a power supply is too easy.  </s>
<s> remove the case cover.  </s>
<s> unplug the power supply leads.  </s>
<s> with a phillips screwdriver remove the four mounting screws on the back.  </s>
<s> remove the ps. place the new ps in the same spot and replace the four screws.  </s>
<s> plug in the leads, they will only go one way.  </s>
<s> depending on the supply you may have leads left over.  </s>
<s> done.  </s>
