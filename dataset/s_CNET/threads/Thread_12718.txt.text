i have an 80 gig hard drive salvaged from a digital video recorder. can't seem to use in pc. it is discovered during bootup but has other than pc fat file system. will not fdisk. can this drive be partioned and formatted for a pc. i've tried a few partitioning programs with this drive as a slave drive. any help is appreciated.
in google for a place to download delpart. download it, put it on a floppy and hopefully that will delete all of the partitons of any type of format on the drive.
many tivos, extreme tvs and other dvrs set the drive to a protected mode. you can google that information, but it takes a special program to unlock it (which i don't have) if delpart doesn't touch it. &quot;hard disk security bios-level hard disk security and password support utilizing ata/atapi security protocols version 1.1,&quot;  and other places... bob
