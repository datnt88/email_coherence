i am running windows xp and my start menu as well as my drop down menus are periodically jittery. it comes and goes, and sometimes changing desktop sizes and resolutions calms it down for short periods. there seems to be no rhyme or reason for it, and i have tried all the conventional troubleshooting methods. sometimes the menus are so jittery that i cannot even read them. help!
are you using a flat panel monitor or a crt monitor? do you happen to be using a heater, flourescent light or some other electrical appliance right next to your monitor (or computer). that can cause problems similar to what you describe as well. the problem only occurs when you have that device on. if you have a crt the refresh rate should be set to at least 72hz or you do get flicker, which may be what you mean by jittery. you do this in advanced settings. the thing to try is a different monitor or your monitor on a different system to try and narrow down the cause.
hello, the monitor is a crt one and i have tried several refresh rates with it. it is now 80hz. it always settles down after i make a change but then starts acting up again. there are no other electrical devices near it. i have a surge protector, but there are only computer related devices plugged into it. the only thing i haven't tried is moving my monitor to my other computer..i will do that in the near future. thanks for the help.
