i know very little about this area and think my questions are stupid, but i don't want to mess anything up so i have to ask them. my 5 year old linksys router (wrt54g) is dying a slow death (regarding laptops picking up the wireless connection) and i'm replacing it with a new router (wrt54g2). my desktop computer (dell inspiron 1720) is running windows vista home premium (32 bit) and i have a dsl modem. my question concerns unhooking the old router and hooking up the new router. what are the steps? should the computer be on or off when unhooking and re-hooking? is it advisable to turn off the firewall during this process (i'm using the latest version of comodo's firewall)? any help would be appreciated.
power off the pc, modem, and router. replace router. power on, in this order: modem (wait for lights to normalize), router (wait again), pc. configure router.
thanks coryphaeus, that was helpful. i have a follow up question. the salesperson at best buy told me i can use the included cd to guide me through setup. is this necessary? can i just type 192.168.1.1 and go through the tabs to mark the new settings the same as what the old settings were?
the setup cd is for the newbie. just be sure to configure your security, wpa/wpa2. after you're done, save the configuration to your hard drive as a backup. you may need it if you ever do a firmware update. after you do an update the backup will put your settings back and you don't have to configure it again. wayne click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software (and a great chocolate-cherry cobbler recipe). daylight savings time - &quot;only white man would believe you could cut off top of blanket, sew it to bottom of blanket, and have longer blanket.&quot;
