<s> i'm a student and i spend about 80% of my time in a lab at school where i have my own personal computer and where it tends to get extremely loud.  </s>
<s> i know i can just go out and buy any earphone for under 100$ and just crank up the volume until my brain is deteriorated by the bass vibrations and i start to drool all over myself, but i consider myself to have a pretty good ear and would like to keep it that way.  </s>
<s> so now my question is, are there earphone out there (preferably in-ear but not restricted to) that can completely block out outside noise, like people not understanding that a 3 to 4 feet of air in between two people does not block sound and yell at the top of their lungs?  </s>
<s> or if not what is the best noise cancellation (active or passive) earphone out there somebody can get, i know they can get pretty expensive but right now that's not the main issue.  </s>
<s> i just want to be able to concentrate on what i'm doing and not hear people yell about whether they prefer tampons or pads and not damage my ear drumbs  </s>
<s> you need to learn how to concentrate.  </s>
<s> or i might be wrong, maybe school are not like it use to be in my younger days (tell me that's not so).  </s>
<s> but good luck in your search.  </s>
<s> thank you for replying but, i'm also an audiophile and like to listen to good quality music and i also need to be able to hear what i'm doing for what i'm studying so you're comment was pretty much useless and insulting.... thanks though!  </s>
<s> good question; dumb answer, ahtoi.  </s>
<s> i've wondered about this myself: if i want 'noise-cancelling' head/earphones, i want the really annoying noise cancelled, which is as often as not the very transient phenomena that 'cancellation' handles poorly: apple/carrot snackers, far-ters, toe-tappers, finger drummers, drivel-talkers, knuckle-crackers, too-loud earphone brain-damaged music listeners.  </s>
<s> i remember one reviewer saying some headphones worked great on a plane to cancel internal jet-noise, but there was a mysterious clicking/popping sound in the phones; the passenger next to him was bopping along to some earphone music with mouth-click/pop accompaniment.  </s>
<s> i gathered the plane noise would have been preferable masking of this idiocy than the useless 'cancellation': the most annoying noise was coming through front and center.  </s>
