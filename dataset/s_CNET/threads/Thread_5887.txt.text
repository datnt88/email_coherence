hey guys, is a dual core processor better for gaming than a single core or should u try and stay with a single core? thanks for the help
some gamers claim they disable it back to single core for best performance. i've never found that to be true. wait and you'll find a disagreeing post on this one. since i also edit a little video, the dual core is all i'll want. bob
the dual core intel &quot;core 2 duo&quot; cpu family is the current top dog for gaming. if you look at the gaming performance scores, you will see that it essentially beats all other cpu families, either single or dual core. google: tomshardware cpu charts
