<s> i have a compaq presario sr1620nx with an amd sempron processor running windows vista (did not come with pc).  </s>
<s> i am currently running the manufacturers video card which is an ati radeon xpress 200 and i just recently bought halo 2 for pc and it does not meet the required graphics standards to run it so i am looking to upgrade but i cannot find a decent graphics card that can run on a 250w power supply, that is compatible with windows vista, and that is 512mb.  </s>
<s> if you have any suggestions or comments on what i should do or buy they are greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thank you in advance.  </s>
<s> shows what we are working with so this means we have a pcie slot.  </s>
<s> i'm going to give the nod to a gt 240 1gb card such as that's a passively cooled card.  </s>
<s> since i can't guess if that wide a card fits or if there is a good breeze in the system let's find one with a fan.  </s>
<s> ok, here we have a very nice 1gb card for 54 bucks after rebate.  </s>
<s> on my hp d4999t the fanless version of this card and the entire machine pulls 120 watts on the p3 watt meter so i didn't have to change the psu.  </s>
<s> that's what i'd get.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i really appreciate that advice i will look into those and pick the best one for my price range.  </s>
<s> again thank you for your help.  </s>
