hello friends, i have a problem which i want to discuss with you, i had to find out answer of a question: are these wireless networks capable enough to completely replace wired networks in future. i have goggled it and come to a conclusion no as they have serious setbacks related to speed security etc. whats your opinion???
are they capable (enough) now to replace wired networks in the future? that's like asking if a 5 year old is capable (enough) now to become president of the usa in the future. and why did you have to find out? kees
are you including all systems such as cellular? and without going into the physics or designs why wouldn't i use the right tool for the job? for example i would not put the video file i need to edit on a wireless nas. i could guess the unseasoned beginner might do that. bob
