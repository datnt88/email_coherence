i own a dell dimension e520 and im planning to upgrade to a 7950 gt .im currenly using a 7300le i was just wondering if this 7950 gt would run without problems
if you want to gamble go right ahead but i recall the box asking for more. bob
the 305w power supply isn't large enough and doesn't have the needed pci-e power cord.
your system's 305w psu has 22amps on the 12v rails. others have run the the 7950gt, 7900gs, 8600gts i run a xfx 8600gt xxx on my dell with the same 305w. a connection from the card to the psu is required though. for the 8600gt, 7600gt, etc. it is not.
there are adapters to go from said 305 psu to said power connection. but the electronics designer in me just wouldn't do this. bob
while watts does matter make sure you have enough amps on the 12v rail my 7800gt oc needs 26amps ,alot of 600 & 700 watt psu dont have that
350w and 22amps required
