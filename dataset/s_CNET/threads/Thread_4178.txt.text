i have been given a epson c66 printer but the drivers are not signed for xp and are causing my system to crash. where can i get signed drivers or a fix? i have tryed epson and the drivers are the same as on the install disc!
while i disagree it's the epson drivers, you can always pack it up and get something else. bob
thank`s very much for your reply. i do have 1 little ? what do you think is causing my crash? with the printer unplugged and the drivers uninstalled i get no problem
i can't guess, but know that outdated video drivers can play a role. bob
