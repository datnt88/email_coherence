i have the eee pc 1005ha-pu1x for use at a second home.....browsing the net, emails, word processing...using bluetooth to connect to my blackberry. love it and works great. now thinking of getting another for just 2 purposes. checking emails and watching dvd's that i own and download(not hd)for use on plane trips and when traveling. have been using my 4&quot; dell laptop but it is heavy and battery life is not that good. my questions is can the above eee or 1001p-pu17 handle the watching of these downloads with only 1gb memory or do i have to upgrade to 2gb? will i see any difference in quality, etc.? thanks for the help and suggestions. would consider another in the same price range, such as samsung n210 and/or n220. or any others. thoughts??
they seem to like the ion video solution.
good suggestion but 12&quot; screen compared to 10&quot;....i would like to stay at the 10&quot; size and weight and also about $150 more than either of the netbooks listed in the first post......since only going to be used for email - movies would like to stay in the price range of $325 - $350. thanks.
the full screen video playback is why many look to better gpu solutions. now that you know the ion you can see what other machines have that. just so you know, this is not a shopping service. many think it is and are miffed when other members don't do the research. bob
on similar netbooks you can even play hd, eveyone says you need ion, but you can see from this video, they got hd working with a few simple solutions.  if you are having trouble now with your system and don't want to do a clean install (which always fixes my netbook troubles) try  but for the price upgrading to 2gb of ram you'll see a definite improvement to your system performance.
with the intel gma 3150 this had the faster gma. the prior models with slower gma chips still suffer. bob
