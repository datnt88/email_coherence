<s> ? is do you have reviews on mram (newely introduced memory type), and is it compatable w/ current forms of ram (ie., can it be substituted for & is there any advantage to that).  </s>
<s> it's been around since 2002 but the first mram production order was earlier this month.  </s>
<s> you won't see it in consumer pcs/electronics until flash hits a wall and can't be improved (which hasn't happended yet).  </s>
<s> feram was used in a design i had the luck to be involved with years ago.  </s>
<s> it was used because unlike eeram and flash the number of erase cycles was many millions (billions?) of cycles.  </s>
<s> how did this become a &quot;new&quot; technology?  </s>
<s> mram and feram are pricey compared to flash so i doubt you'll see it in consumer products this year.  </s>
