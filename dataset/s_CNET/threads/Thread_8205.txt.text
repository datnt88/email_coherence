please / thanks: windows xp 5.1 sp3; just got the hp printer noted above; it's been sitting in an office for about five years, lonely; worked fine, she says; downloaded/installed what i could e-locate for the model; my pc tells me all is well with the newbie, but when it comes printtime, the paper moves through appropriately, the appropriate sound of the ink mechanism moving back and forth is heard, but the grand result is, merely, a blank sheet of paper. the ink cartridges and electroconnection points are clean and dry. shall i conclude that the souls of the ink cartridges have flown the bodies after having been unattended and unused for such a length of time? haven't tried new cartridges yet. or is there something else i should be attending to? thanks / appreciated.
definitely would be gone. look at a cartridge on the shelf today and notice the expiry date for an example. bob
thanks!
