hi, i picked up this monitor from a local goodwill for about $20. it didn't have a power supply, so i ordered a replacement (not from hp, from another vendor). the one i got is rated at 12v, 5a, and it worked fine. but after a day, i discovered the backlight power failure issue that apparently plagues these monitors. discovered the thread here, and though most of the solutions pointed to problems in hp's power supply, i wanted to see if anyone has a suggestion if i'm using a new, non-hp power supply. thanks!
provided the ps falls into the same specs as the old hp one did, there shouldn't be a problem. the issue on this forum that users had were bad &quot;inverters&quot; located within the lcd itself, not the ps. the inverter had poor manufacture or componets so they got whacked. the reply of that same monitor also provided links to fixes and repairs that could be made or at least point to the problem area. this needs some disassembly so if you're not capable, then find a good repair center/shop. that $20 lcd may not be a bargain after all. use the forum search engine to locate the topic. tada -----willy
thanks willy! time to get out the soldering iron. i'm working on reading through that thread now but it's over 350 posts, mostly furious customers posting their frustrating treatment at the hands of hp tech support, so it's taking me a little while ...
believe me its worth looking to hit the one with the &quot;details and such&quot; and breakdown of the lcd case. i used hp 1703 and possibly hp 1503(similar) to get those valuable tips/hints/fixes/cures, etc. via the forum search. good luck -----willy
here is a direct link, that was founded via c/net then on to a user that really started a blog.  again good luck -----willy
thanks again. unbelievable. if only fixing everything was that easy. the solder points on mine looked good, but i put more on anyway - 15 minutes and it was working perfectly.
