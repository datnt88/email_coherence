i have a grid 19dbi outside antenna with 400 cable with a rp-tnc to male connector on the end of the cable. i have wifi here but it is weak. i have a linksys wrt54gs router. how can i connect my outside antenna cable to the internet plug of my router? then i think i can get a stronger signal. thanks in advance lwl0913
that's weak.
no not 400ft 400 cable thats 20ft good god man whats wrong with you
your post is unclear and poorly written. however a 20 foot cable is also unacceptable. you'll want to get that down to just a few feet. i do not offer to teach rf tech here but that's far too long and will create very odd issues. bob
simply upgrade to the new linksys dual n wireless routers. it has two n routers in one box with incredible speed and range. wrt610n
the 400 20ft cable works very well when the wifi trans is fairly close its just that it is weak for my usb wireless adapter.
what is the purpose of going to this router will this router connect to my antenna cable?????????????????????????????
i had a bum one and here's one that worked well enough over the usual home.  i've ordered another one to try with my cantenna which is this one (untested yet)  -&gt; it would be in your best interest to reply to your top post and rewrite it clearly what 400 is and more. bob
