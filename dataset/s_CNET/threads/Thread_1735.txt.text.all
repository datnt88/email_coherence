hi there and hope someone can help or advise if possible. 
i cant see where the 4 pin connector from the atx psu (2 yell 2 blk wires - 12 volt i think) is supposed to connect to my motherboard. the m'bd is a pc100 socket 370 and has psu input sockets for either at (2 x 6 pin) or atx (1 x 20 pin)the m'bd manual shows a 22 way connector(j7) and shows where to connect spkr, power led's, keylock pins, hdd led's, reset switch and power switch. 
not all pins are used with the old at psu. 
please help, thank you, heather 
at least none i've seen. 
new power supplies will have this as well as sata power connections that you might not use.

thanks bob, much appreciated heather
