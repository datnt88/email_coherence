(i am a novice when it comes to that). i guess i'll go from there and figure it out unless anyone has a suggestion of other wireless cards compatible with it. it would be great to just keep buying cards that sounded good and return them when they don't work, but unless you are a computer shop or tester, who has that time and especially money to keep doing that? thanks again for the replies.
