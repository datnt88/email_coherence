<s> i just ordered these speakers... and now i realize it says &quot;whitebox&quot;. what does this mean you think in the case of these speakers?  </s>
<s> thanks for any help!  </s>
<s> original equipment manufacturer.  </s>
<s> the speakers were originally sold to a company that makes computers to sell with the computers.  </s>
<s> the mfr eventually ends up with some unsold and sells the entire batch to another reseller.  </s>
<s> normally you won't get any documentation, [the original mfr didn't need it] and no fancy box.  </s>
<s> a few different scenarios, but similar.  </s>
<s> it can mean refurbished items such as hard drives that are sent back to the manufacturer.  </s>
<s> they are repaired and resold to jobbers as whitebox or white labled.  </s>
