<s> hey guys, is a dual core processor better for gaming than a single core or should u try and stay with a single core?  </s>
<s> thanks for the help  </s>
<s> some gamers claim they disable it back to single core for best performance.  </s>
<s> i've never found that to be true.  </s>
<s> wait and you'll find a disagreeing post on this one.  </s>
<s> since i also edit a little video, the dual core is all i'll want.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the dual core intel &quot;core 2 duo&quot; cpu family is the current top dog for gaming.  </s>
<s> if you look at the gaming performance scores, you will see that it essentially beats all other cpu families, either single or dual core.  </s>
<s> google: tomshardware cpu charts  </s>
