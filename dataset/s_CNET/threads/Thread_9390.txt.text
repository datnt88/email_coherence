my printer worked fine until i did 'dir&gt;prn'. i get error: 'printspooler not running' and no printer activity or even recognition of printer. am using xp and brother hl-1440 laser printer, microsoft's 'automatic' suggestions don't help. please help! thanks
1. reboot. solves most of this problems, unless it's a hardware issue. 2. printer selftest (if possible from the printer) 3. install on another pc and see if it works there. kees
go to start&gt; run &gt; cmd and press enter, then type 'net start spooler' i guess the print spooler service stopped for some reason, try the above steps and let us know if it works ... vc
finally got solution: called brother(printer mfg) and got following faq: faq000539_000 (spent ~30 min on phone) installed this and my printer works! thanks everyone for your help! stanx3
