hello all, i would like to upgrade my gateway fx4710 speakers to m-audio 2.0 av40's. in order to appreciate these speakers, do i need to upgrade over the existing integrated sound card? can this be done with pci express x1? if so, any sound card recommendations? thanks, gymiii

thanks for your fast response ramarc. i enjoy quality sound reproduction. however, i'm not familiar with pc sound cards, slot configurations, etc. jim
