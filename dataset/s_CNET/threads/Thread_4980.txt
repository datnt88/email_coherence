9511	6	337370	3016774	3016724	r. proffitt	4/2/09 5:35 pm	1.2386937e12	i forgot to mention one thing.	how do i know those numbers? i bought a few watt meters to find out where and what uses what amount of power around the house. i'm sure i made my 20 bucks back as i found simple things like a cordless phone that was rarely used but drew 3+ watts 24x365 days a year among other bigger discoveries. heck that's only 26,280 watt hours i cut back with a 3 watt device! 1 pound of coal can generate 8,800/9,500 of a kilowatt-hour, or 926 watt-hours. so that single change cut my yearly use by 28 pounds of coal. bob
