<s> monitor is samsung syncmaster 2253lw and the video card is gigabyte radeon 9200.  </s>
<s> both have analog and digital ports.  </s>
<s> running winxp pro, sp3, and the samsung drivers have been installed.  </s>
<s> the analog signal works just fine.  </s>
<s> some monitors don't autoswitch based on the live signal.  </s>
<s> i don't believe i know where to go to accomplish that.  </s>
<s> i looked in the bios, but didn't see anything there to change, and the cables are terminated differently for dvi, and only use the rectangular fitting.  </s>
<s> look in the monitor menu settings, there should be an option, vga/dvi etc.  </s>
