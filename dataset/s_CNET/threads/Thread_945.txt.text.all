<s> set your graphics card to the native resolution of the monitor.  </s>
<s> ...for the information.  </s>
<s> so the graphics card must be compatible, otherwise, have it changed ?  </s>
<s> haven't thought of that !  </s>

<s> not only must we install the graphics card driver but the monitor.inf  </s>
<s> file for that monitor in a lot of cases to inform the graphics card driver what video modes to offer the owner.  </s>
<s> this area is a little confusing at first.  </s>

<s> just bought a 22&quot; 1680x1050 samsung monitor to replace old 19&quot; 1280x1024 crt. the new monitor works but the highest i'm offered in display settings is 1280x1024, even though my pc clearly recognisies the new monitor and i've installed its driver.  </s>
<s> i've been told that any graphics card should be able to handle a higher resolution with ease (my graphic card was bought 2003)so any ideas why i can't get the right res for the new monitor?  </s>
<s> many thanks hajr12  </s>
<s> make, model of display, display card, driver versions of the video card and a link to the monitor.inf for your monitor.  </s>
<s> without such i can't offer much.  </s>

<s> thanks for your swift response.  </s>

<s> read and repeat the steps they did to fix it.  </s>
<s> if you can't find the latest drivers for any of the items, call the place you got it and ask for them or ask for an exchange.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks bob.  </s>
<s> unfortunately the link you gave appears to be down at present. is it possible my current graphics card is too old/unsupported in terms of drivers to handle a widescreen monitor?  </s>
<s> bottom line: is this a problem i could solve simply by buying a more up to date graphics card?  </s>

<s> turned out my motherboard was a grand-motherboard and wouldn't support a graphics card sufficient to power the monitor at the native res - or something.  </s>
