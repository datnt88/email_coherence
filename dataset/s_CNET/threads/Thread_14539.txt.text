i've had a 400w psu for a few years, and i almost 100% sure its the cause of my crashing games and bsod's. i'm going to upgrade my gpu, but i'm pretty sure i'll need a beefier power supply. is there any good companies? i'd like to get something in the high 500's or even 600's watts. if you have any tips on how i need to change the psu it would be greatly appreiacted. i've been around and in the computer alot, but i'm not sure how to upgarde the psu. i hear antec makes good ones. thank you ibrahim jadoon
but another noteworthy name is  but that brutal cheap person in me hunted down some 680 watt 20 buck psus that i replaced an aging 450 watt that was was suspicious of. bob
antec (as bob said) pc power and cooling (considered best of the best) ocz enermax (most units) fortron source power (fsp group, and their hgher up stuff is fine) sparkle power (same stuff as fortron (their like the same company)) and some of thermaltake's units are fine, depending on what your using it for also 600w is rather huge i'd suggest 480w - 580w ensure the psu has at least 24a on the +12v rail or 2 12v rails at around 15a+ each (for example, antec's newpower is 12v1 20a, 12v2 18a, which is fine) or 3-4 12v rails, with 15a each or more
thanks alot. i'll be looking into antec and that one other company, pcpowerandcooling.com, thanks alot!
