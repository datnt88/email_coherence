<s> i have an nvida geforce fx 5600 256mb agp8x version and the fan on the card is starting to die out.  </s>
<s> every now and then (its getting more frequent) the fan will make a noise as if its blades are rubbing against something (theyre not, ive checked many many times.) one of these days the fan will just die, and well if the fan dies i think we all know what will happen to the card.  </s>
<s> i need to know where i can get a fan that can fit the card, and the cards power supply (the current fan draws its power from a power port thats on the card.) the power interface is less important since i can just plug it into the computers power supply.  </s>
<s> i dont know what the dimensions of the fan are (i guess i could measure it and find out) and i have no idea how much power the fan runs on.  </s>
<s> ive looked on the nvidia site and they dont have anything since they dont sell their products direct.  </s>
<s> thanks for your help  </s>
<s> nvidia does chips and not fans or boards, so they won't help you out.  </s>
<s> try 1coolpc.com or the maker of the card.  </s>

<s> if its one of those &quot;generic&quot; type of box fans and not a fancy fan, it should be 40mm or 50mm in size.  </s>
<s> alot of part websites offer replacement fans, besides the fan size, look for &quot;depth/thickness&quot; of fan, it could make a differece.  </s>
<s> look here or elsewhere: (used/new) -or- if push comes to shove, try a rescue of fan: how to fix a fan ================== tools ----------- 1) sharp penknife or safety razor 2) light oil, like sewing machine or household oil (3-in-1 oil) 3) plain scotch tape or similar procedure ------------------- if you have a noisy fan and no replacement, try the following.  </s>
<s> remove fan from mounting and save screws or unclip the fan.  </s>
<s> clean any dust or dirt build-up at this time as best as possible.  </s>
<s> now with fan in hand, most fans have a sticker maybe with some logo, this is the top side, the bottom side sticker, probably blank. the bottom side is the side you want to work on.  </s>
<s> slice a small half-moon cut, slightly off-center on the sticker/decal on the bottom.  </s>
<s> you *don't* want to remove sticker/decal entirely.  </s>
<s> flip flap open to expose center of fan and place 1-drop of oil there, don't over do it, blot any excess oil.  </s>
<s> rotate the fan to work the oil in and then place fan with bottom side up on a flat surface.  </s>
<s> allow gravity to migrate oil into bearing for 10-minutes.when  </s>
<s> done, tape over the cut flap and remount fan.  </s>
<s> use deft care and don't over-tighten screws, you're done.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
