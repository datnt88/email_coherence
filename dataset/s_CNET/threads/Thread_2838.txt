(an example is the the maxtor sata ii hard drives that required a firmware upgrade to function properly with nforce3/4 chipsets.) as i wrote earlier, that's when i return it for a functional/compatible model. bear in mind that i'm not completely discounting a quirky enclosure that has nonstandard limitations. i wonder what would happen if dprudlow tried to make a 120gb partition or a 200gb partition. i will also note that i saw many reviews at newegg.com and elsewhere with 320gb drives, one 400gb drive, and a 500gb drive successfully formatted on a nexstar 3 model. since there is more than one model of vantec nexstar 3, maybe dprudlow can provide us with the exact model number?
3172	31	242005	2460912	2460905	linkit	4/15/07 4:19 pm	1.17665394e12	i understand the frustration	i wonder if seagate or vantec has a &quot;known issue&quot; of incompatibility? some hard drives makers have issued a firmware upgrade for certain hard drive models that are incompatible with popular chipsets. maybe it's worth contacting seagate and/or vantec to see what they know. maybe it's not worth it the time and trouble, and it's time to consider starting the return process to exchange it for an enclosure known to be compatible with your seagate model family. i wish you all the best!
