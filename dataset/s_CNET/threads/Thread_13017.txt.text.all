<s> i have been facing mouse freeze problem since sometime.  </s>
<s> what is happening that after system starts things work fine.  </s>
<s> after sometime, especially when i go for composing any message or for a stroll and leave mouse idle for sometime then it stops rolling horizontally.  </s>
<s> t rolls very smoothly vertically but doesn't move horizontally.  </s>
<s> after umpteen tries it resumes horizontal movement but in a sluggish manner i.e. smooth movement is lost on horizontal direction, lot of efforts are needed to place cursor anywhere.  </s>
<s> mouse is an old logitech mouse, os is win2k.  </s>
<s> so can you offer any clue what can be wrong and how to solve this problem ?  </s>
<s> [a] is mouse bad ?  </s>
<s> i do not have a spare one to check. is os/driver/setting corrupt ?  </s>
<s> how to check this ?  </s>
<s> thx in advance for your suggestions.  </s>

<s> bad mouse, bad! if it won't behave, get a new one.  </s>
<s> you didn't mention what type so presume it's the wheel kind.  </s>
<s> sometimes you can feel the crud build up on the inner cylindrical rollers on these and clean them off.  </s>
<s> some have an optical code wheel inside that gets dirt in the slots you can clean...if you take it apart.  </s>
<s> it just depends on how much you love this mouse and don't want to part with it.  </s>
<s> thank you for your suggestions.  </s>
