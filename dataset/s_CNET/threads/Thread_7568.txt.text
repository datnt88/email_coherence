which is better from highest to lowest? intel celeron intel pentium dual core(dual core make big difference compare to those that don't have it?) amd phenom ii amd athlon ii x2 240 dual core
those would be classes unto themselves so why not look at cpu charts? example at
celeron (slowest) pentium dual core and athlon ii (about the same) phenom ii (fastest) the phenom ii is amd's top of the line cpu family and come in 3 core, 4 core and 6 core varaitons. the phenom ii is faster than any other amd product.
