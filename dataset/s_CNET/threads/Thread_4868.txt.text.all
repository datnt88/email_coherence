<s> ok, here is my problem.  </s>
<s> i had windows 7 installed on my computer, everything was working fine.  </s>
<s> i installed mass effect 2 on my computer.  </s>
<s> worked fine for about, oh, 2 hours.  </s>
<s> then my monitor started to flicker.  </s>
<s> every 30-60 seconds, the screen would go blank for a split second and return back to the game.  </s>
<s> to my dismay, not only does this flickering occur in the game, but also in windows.  </s>
<s> and the funny thing is, is that it only happens when i do certain things like when the download dialog box pops up, or i pull down a menu list on a website, or when i go to install something. it seems to me it occurs when something pops up on my screen like a dialog box, but not every dialog box though.  </s>
<s> i can neither confirm nor deny that windows 7 and mass effect 2 were legit, so i though viruses were the problem.  </s>
<s> scanned for virus, nothing came up.  </s>
<s> since i recently installed windows 7 on my computer, i thought i could fix it if i did a clean install of windows 7. this did not work.  </s>
<s> now, i'm back on vista business 32 bit and it is still occurring in the same manner.  </s>
<s> now i'm almost positive this is a hardware issue.  </s>
<s> my monitor could not be the problem because the flickering is linked to specific action on the computer.  </s>
<s> i've disabled my video card driver and the problem has stopped.  </s>
<s> i'm not an expert on hardware issues, could this be a problem with my motherboard, faulty memory, faulty video card?... it's a 8800gt.  </s>
<s> dell vostro 410.  </s>
<s> at just 2 years with many not doing the yearly cleaning (read ) plus bad caps (google that) about half the time i find it's not drivers or pop ups.  </s>
<s> good sleuthing on the drivers but here's the deal.  </s>
<s> windows 7 is better than the prior versions on drivers but far from done.  </s>
<s> try the usual.  </s>
<s> remove the case cover and point a fan at it. the reason you make me think it is heat related is the 2 hours.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you say that you think it is heat related, do you think it is damaged?  </s>
<s> even when my computer is not in intensive applications (crysis), it still flickers.  </s>
<s> i don't think blowing off some dust at this point will help if the gpu is damaged.  </s>
<s> and the 2 hours was why i thought heat.  </s>
<s> as to damage, the only true test is to swap the card since the makers do not supply diagnostics.  </s>
