<s> a few months ago, colleges that my dependent was accepted to all said there were no requirements as to desktop/laptop, os, 32/64/dual core.  </s>
<s> all these major universities had laptop to check out in the libraries.  </s>
<s> dorms have internet capablity.  </s>
<s> now the it department of university chosen is saying the way to go is a laptop that is dual core (t2300, t2400, or t2500) and vista capable.  </s>
<s> so what's everyone's take: a decent desktop running xp home and ms office or a new laptop priced from $1300 that is dual core and supposed to support vista?  </s>
<s> since vista isn't here many a vendor can say it supports vista, but its not set in stone yet.  </s>
<s> students perfer laptops but a decent desktop does just as well.  </s>
<s> if cost is an issue a desktop will do fine.  </s>
<s> if cost isn't then a laptop is better only if because its mobile.  </s>
<s> please don't exclude any insurance as laptops are the number 1 item stolen on campus next to ipods.  </s>
<s> as for dual core, that's fancy stuff if you need it, get it but basic single core does fine and overall for all tasks whatever they maybe.  </s>
<s> for an entering freshman, a desktop is ok, as needs become more clearer, then spring for a new laptop maybe in the jr. year.  </s>
<s> also, expect the need for a flashdrive and/or wireless option for whatever system is gotten should be part of the package.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> at one college a plan with dell was something you would kill for. it included 4 years of service.  </s>
<s> very amazing deal.  </s>
<s> they also supplied a list of machines.  </s>
<s> it was bound to happen that someone would kick up the requirements.  </s>
<s> will those have have substandard units upgrade?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> there is a company through school that does sell laptops and desktops (laptops are primary).  </s>
<s> the only major difference between other vendors is that they provide 4 year program; but no software is listed.  </s>
<s> others of same price, memory, hd, processor usually have xp pro or windows media.  </s>
<s> the academic deals for the os and office reduce that effect but service for your laptop is expensive.  </s>
<s> i'll write in the near 1 thousand buck range for the lcd or motherboard failures.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i just finished my freshman year at college, and i have a laptop.  </s>
<s> as long as you have a modern laptop (not one that's three or so years old like mine), a laptop should take care of every need a college student has.  </s>
<s> it's definitely good to have a usb drive laying around, as they get used a lot.  </s>
<s> right now, vista really isn't that big of a deal for a college student, so i wouldn't worry about that little part.  </s>
<s> windows xp will do fine.  </s>
<s> and dual core is a nice touch, but it isn't necessarily needed.  </s>
<s> the only real problem with laptops is screen size.  </s>
<s> there have been reports released that staring at small (12&quot; of so) laptop screens for hours (as college students are prone to do) can be very bad for the eyes.  </s>
<s> therefore, i'd suggest getting something with a decent-sized screen.  </s>
<s> mine is about a 13&quot;, and it's a little small for me, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> just make sure it's something that will be comfortable to look at.  </s>
<s> --chedrz  </s>
<s> i want to thank everyone for their input.  </s>
<s> her desktop has wireless capability and she has a usb drive because it was policy at high school not to allow diskettes from outside sources.  </s>
<s> she doesn't really like working on a laptop, so i was surprised when she said this.  </s>
<s> the absolute minimum requirement in my opinion is a 64-bit processor.  </s>
<s> this is something to watich for because intel currently doesn't have a 64-bit mobile chips yet (unless you count the pentium 4, which runs too hot anyway).  </s>
<s> dual-core isn't too important because few applications can take advantages of dual-core.  </s>
<s> for the desktop: any amd chip with 64-bit will be enough (including the sempron).  </s>
<s> intel is ok but their chips output more heat which translates to more fan noise.  </s>
<s> if you absolutely need a dual-core chip, then go for the pentium d 9xx series.  </s>
<s> avoid the 8xx series becuase they run much hotter and a little slower. the one exception would be the 805 because it isn't as clocked as high so it's thermal output is less.  </s>
<s> for the laptop: currently the only 64-bit laptop chip that is out there is the turion 64. intel chips get better battery life but they don't have 64-bit support.  </s>
