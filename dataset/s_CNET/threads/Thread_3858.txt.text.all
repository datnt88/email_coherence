<s> first of all, i want to thanks all the people who answered my questions, for taking so much patient to do it, i know that some questions are a little stupid, but what can i do?? :$ well, after that.  </s>
<s> i want to know one thing... i have a case with the option to install a cooling fan, connected to the mobo, (3 pins conector).  </s>
<s> but i don`t know if it`s necessary.  </s>
<s> the specs of my computer are: amd semprom 2800+ pcchips mobo, k7 863g 512 ram (1 ddr, 333mhz), 128mb.  </s>
<s> asus video card, geforce 5200fx (without cooling fan) lg cd-rw unit.  </s>
<s> western digital hd 7200rpm, (80gb).  </s>
<s> sound blaster live, audio card.  </s>
<s> most days (5 days per week) i leave it, on all night, and part of the day, downloading some music or games.  </s>
<s> so, do i need a heat extractor?  </s>
<s> or should i leave it, just like it`s.  </s>
<s> thanks a lot!  </s>
<s> bye  </s>
<s> i guess you can, since u leave it on for so long.  </s>
<s> but i think it depends on the temperature it runs at.  </s>
<s> understand that &quot;airflow&quot; is important to maintain a well cooled system.  </s>
<s> its always good insurance to have adqueate yet properly placed fan(s) and/or water cooling system. the whole purpose to keep componets within operating specs and prevent any heat related stress, otherwise things start to go downhill.  </s>
<s> if you have the option to install yet another fan via the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> or directly to power harness plug, do it, its cheap insurance.  </s>
<s> beware, any power demands of any kind to add up, so a decent power supply is a must.  </s>
<s> fyi - i have a 5200nvida chipset as well, but it does use a fan to keep it cool.  </s>
<s> i'm sure yours uses a rather large heatsink.  </s>
<s> thus, it needs a well cooled system case to help control its own &quot;passive cooling&quot;, ok. enjoy -----willy  </s>
<s> dear friend, first of all buy a 350 wt supply device for your case.  </s>
<s> secondly it is absolutely necessary to have two fans for your case because your behaviour towards your computer is generally characterized as heavy duty.  </s>
<s> you do not have to bother the mobo.  </s>
<s> do not forget that the mobo needs energy to supply all the system .  </s>
<s> and finally, a ups device is essential.  </s>
<s> that's all.  </s>
<s> bye !!! charidimos.  </s>
<s> im heavy duty.... havent turned my comp off in 23 days.  </s>
<s> hasnt been off for any reason except to travlle to a lan party in 6 months.  </s>
<s> heh.  </s>
<s> generally speaking, it never hurts to have extra cooling.  </s>
<s> (i've never heard of a computer freezing to death, have you?) however, if the heat sink is good enough, sometimes a fan isn't necessary...it might just end up blowing a lot of dust around.  </s>
