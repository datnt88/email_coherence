hi, i have a cisco linksys wag320n router at the moment and i am wondering what would be a suitable range extender to use. i really want the best one not too particular about the brand. i just can't really find many reviews of range extenders online. thanks
i find them to not always work with every router. because of that i use the old router as a wap solution. bob
hi vignesh, i have used the linksys wre54g in the past with clients and it has helped in all cases. it is best to use an extender that is of the same make. i hope this helps.
the most popular one is the wre54g but not everyone prefers that model. if you take a look at the reviews on  you will get tonnes of reviews on it. some people appear to prefer it just because its easy to use and you don't really have to be concerned about it being the &quot;best&quot;. but then there's a bunch of people who are interested in their latest releases which are just picking up steam. take a look either way and you'll find something on there.
