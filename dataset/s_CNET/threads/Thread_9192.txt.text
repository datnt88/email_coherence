this summer, i bought an inspiron 6000 from dell. it has 512 ram and a 64 mb graphics card. i was wondering, can i get a graphics card if i need to sometime in the future?
i am fairly confident that your motherboard will not take a new gpu. i'm sorry. few laptops can have an upgraded gpu. could your run belarc advisor for me to make sure? maybe you can... look under video adapters. does it say anything about pci-e or agp or something? ~ibrahim~
if you can, dell would know and have the right video card.
i didn't see anything like that, and i searched the page for pci-e and agp but nothing came up.
how do i find out? there was an option of a bigger 128 mb card, but i didn't go for it when i bought the machine.
not all laptops have upgradable cards. dell should tell you with just one call. bob
