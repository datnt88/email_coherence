i want to move the itunes downloaded music i have on my hard drive to a 1 gb jump drive. what is the best way to do this? should i use a jump drive? or should i get an external hard drive. i am currently using a hp pavilion laptop with a windows xp. any help would be appreciated.
am i on the wrong forum? if so, can someone point me in the right direction. i would appreciate it.
mr.angel, you are suppose to go to software category under mac applications & utilities or pc applications & utilities.you&quot;ll find your right answer. thanks yacube
