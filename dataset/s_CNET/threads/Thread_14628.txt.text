i do not know much about his computer specs sorry.... but the @ does not work, and it comes up as &quot;. he purchased another wireless keyboard with mouse and it is still with the same problem. the os is windows vista 64-bit with 250gb hard-drive, 4gb ram. is this a well known problem? i be so grateful if anyone who can sort this very annoying problem out for me....
in windows there is that keyboard or regional settings that re-map the keyboard to match the keyboard or region/language. nothing sounds wrong here with the hardware. but a trip to the control panel and changing the keyboard would be what i do next. bob
