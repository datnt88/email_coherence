<s> i would like to find out if the usb ports on my toshiba satellite 5205-s503 can power a portable storage device such as the lacie porche mobile hard drive (80 gb 5400 rpm).  </s>
<s> i looked in devices & found only the manufacturer (nec) & the driver version (5.1.2600).  </s>
<s> i'm it is us.  </s>
<s> b 2.0.  </s>
<s> short of calling the manufacturer how do i find out?  </s>
<s> thank-you  </s>
<s> usb 1.x or 2.0's power is 500 milliamps and every laptop drive i see listed 1.0 to 1.5 amperes.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you can get ab optional ac adapter with that product.  </s>
<s> adaptec has an enclosure for 2.5&quot; hard disk drives that pull power from two usb ports or an optional ac adapter.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> agree with bob , however that drive is sold as a usb/firewire external so there are two possibilities.  </s>
<s> you can try a usb splitter cable that has two plugs that plug into two of yourusb ports and deliver the sum of the two ports' output to your device.  </s>
<s> i have been using this arrangement for over a year with no problems.however in the event that your laptop can't put out enough juice you can get a very small usb adapter that you connect to one of the cable branches while the other plugs into your computer for data transfer.  </s>
<s> i think you'll find the first arrangement will work for you as an inexpensive approach regards seewart  </s>
