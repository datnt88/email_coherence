i recently bought an 80gb zune. using my old ipod's plug that connects the zune to a tv, i attempted to connect the zune to a friend's tv. however, it did not work and i lost all of the directional buttons and touch-features on the directional pad. the play/pause and back buttons work fine. however, i cannot restart it because this involved pressing up on the pad and back, and this is obviously impossible with the pad out of commission. is there any software i can download to refresh the zune? additionally is there any other way to manually reset it? i've held down the play/pause button many times and the zune software is up to date.
call it in and see where they want you to send it.
if this is a recent purchase, do call the support or repair side of zune. pssst... i wouldn't mention you used a non-zune(non-compatible) cable with it and the problem appeared. afterall, i suspect the zune and ipod cables are different at least *assume* they're not interchangeable. tada -----willy
