will a product like this make standard tv look look like hdtv, or a dvd look like a blu-ray disc? what doe this thing really do? i am very confused. please help me! thanks in advance!
if that's not clear enough then i'll write no.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh????? i am confused! what does this thing do?
their mouth is moving. as to explaining it, i think some work at google should do just fine.
i take that to mean not a hdtv. upscaler are for hdtv uses; and i might add something else here. upscaler can only help so much so don't expect it to replace a bru-ray player (even for hdtv). this thing is awfully expensive..in my view. what was you expectation of the device (just curious)?
