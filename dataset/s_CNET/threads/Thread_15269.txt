2479	5	263195	2579100	2579083	r. proffitt	9/7/07 9:10 am	1.1891562e12	yes i did.	i noted the software and method in my reply. i don't offer step by step replies. those are for our newbies forum. sorry but if you didn't catch my fix in my first reply it would be unlikely you would find it in further replies. bob
