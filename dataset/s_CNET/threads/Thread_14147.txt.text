i forgot my vista password on my dell so i am trying to run system restore so i can just restore the settings. but everytime i try and do so the keyboard freezes up and i can't choose any of the options. i was told to try a ps keyboard instead of a usb port keyboard but there isnt an outlet in the back for this type of keyboard. so i tryed a converter but that isn't working either. the computer is a dell dimension e521. please help ..
see what ntpasswd at google.com finds. -&gt; it's what i use. bob
thanks for the reply... well i have this one disc i got to try and get the password but i can't even set the boot menu to run on that drive so that it will work at startup. since the keyboard freezes up...
i moved the hard disk to a properly working machine and booted ntpasswd to reset the passwords. i never booted that hard disk in another machine (very important!) put the hard disk back into the original machine and i was done. sorry to hear your machine needs repair. did you call dell while it was in warranty to have them correct this error? bob
