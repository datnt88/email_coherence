i built a new computer with a stock intel 3 ghz cpu and fan. the fan is unbelieveable loud. is this a common problem with the intel fans? should i just buy a less loud aftermarket fan? any thoughts on why it's so loud? thanks for any help. russ
my intel supplied fans have been very quiet. if you got some third party fan, i'd believe it, but do call the supplier and ask for an exchange. bob
nope, it's a stock intel fan. it is so loud. any thoughts?
also, put in a new case at the same time as cpu. could it be the fault of the case? thanks russ
power down and check the fan blade area to see if anything is touching the fan blades as they spin around. every once in awhile, someone will have a bent blade or a cable the is in the wrong place, but i bought some intel hsfs to replace some third party fans so to drop some noise. bob
