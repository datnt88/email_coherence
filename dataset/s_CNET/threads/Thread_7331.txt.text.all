<s> i recently bought a usb3 portable hdd.  </s>
<s> case.  </s>
<s> from my unscientific observation, it seem to me it is as fast as my esata hdd...it might even be slightly faster.  </s>
<s> i transferred 3.8gb video as a test and it took about 3 minutes, and my esata takes about 4 minutes.  </s>
<s> oh the usb3 case is connected to the usb2 port of the computer only.  </s>
<s> i didn't have a usb3 port to connect it to (another story for later).  </s>
<s> i transferred a 2.44 gig file from my main box to both a usb 2 and an esata external.  </s>
<s> the esata transfer took about 21.5 seconds and the usb 2 was about a minute and a half.  </s>
<s> your 3.8 gig file is roughly 1/2 again as large as the one i used so my transfer of your file on my system would be roughly 33 seconds to the esata and 2 1/2 minutes to the usb2.  </s>
<s> then i have.  </s>
<s> i was really looking to see if just the usb3 case alone would make a difference as i have experienced.  </s>
<s> my usb2 transfer rate usually ran about 2 minute per gb.  </s>
<s> it's a turtle compare to what you have.  </s>
<s> and not the usb.  </s>
<s> your usb connection seems to be more consistent with my usb 2. in a sense, that might answer your own question.  </s>
<s> you are operating at usb 2 functionality but your esata is messed up.  </s>
<s> it should be much faster.  </s>
<s> i wonder if you don't suffer from that intel matrix storage manager issue.  </s>
