<s> i would like to upgrade my video card from my nvidia geforce fx5200.  </s>
<s> what would be a reasonable nvidia uprade for my system in the $100-$150 range?  </s>
<s> i am concerned about compatability and cooling.  </s>
<s> system: pentium 4 3.2ghz, 3 gig ram, motherboard intel d865glc.  </s>
<s> i am unsure of wattage of power supply.  </s>
<s> three things to take into account: 1. available slots: agb, pci or pci-e.  </s>
<s> wrong type won't fit at all.  </s>
<s> 2. power supply.  </s>
<s> if you're unsure, how can we know?  </s>
<s> 3. cooling.  </s>
<s> if this is an xp machine, 3 gb ram doesn't make much sense probably (depending on what you do with the machine).  </s>
<s> but it doesn't harm either.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> you have to see if agp is available.  </s>
<s> after that, choose from this list -&gt; if you can't tell what the power supply is then replace it at the same time with a monster.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i checked the innards and it is an agp slot, 300 watt power supply.  </s>
<s> recommendations?  </s>
<s> i've been looking for agp video cards and i see most newer cards use the pci express interface.  </s>
<s> maybe i just need to wait a few years and replace the pc. it is 4 years old.  </s>
<s> agp cards are in that list and you can find 450+ watt power supplies that will do nicely.  </s>
<s> i don't see what's stopping you now.  </s>
