<s> hello, for months a i have had zero success trying to network epson 4800 printers on a windows 2003 server from a mac client (10.5.6).  </s>
<s> i am able to print directly to the printer via ip, but when i send the job to the server nothing happens and i get a communication error.  </s>
<s> epson support would not give me any help ...and stated that epson drivers do not support any server os. so i then created a xp pro box to queue jobs and still had the same problem.  </s>
<s> i need to get these up on a server!  </s>
<s> are there any alternative drivers that are a close match to the epson 4800's?  </s>
<s> generic drivers will queue to the server, however print quality is sketchy..... i just can't seem to face the fact that i'm unable to queue epson printers on a server client network!  </s>
<s> there must be a way!  </s>
<s> i administer a print server with a variety of printers and only epson give me trouble.  </s>
<s> anyone out there run into this issue?  </s>
<s> thanks for reading!  </s>
<s> j  </s>
<s> forgetting about putting it on any windows or pc/apple at all?  </s>
<s> that is put it on a 25 buck print server?  </s>
<s> i used this a few times -&gt; sorry, i do not have an epson.  </s>
<s> just some hp k550.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> unfortunately, i must try to put these epsons on a windows server print queue.  </s>
<s> we use pharos pay per print tracking system.....this is the only way the college i work at can charge students per print.  </s>
<s> i have never had any trouble with hp and cannon printers, both large format and laserjets without any trouble.  </s>
<s> then no epson for you.  </s>
<s> sorry but you'll have to work with pharos or who you can pay to fix this one.  </s>
<s> i deal with mostly business, home, office setups and never had to keep such on a windows server.  </s>
