i want to upgrade my video cards. can i buy any card that fits my needs or do i need to get a card from the manufacture i bought my computer from. i dont want to buy something that wont work on my system. i bought my computer about 5 years ago.
what are your needs? what computer manufacturer and model name? what video card do you already have?
oops sorry, i use it for internet, home work, pay bills, and play games. i like to play role play games on and off line. it's a dell, dimension 4400, pent 4 processor 1.6 ghz, 16mb ati rage 4x agp graphics card. i bought it back in 2002. i just upgrade my memory to 768 mb i don't want to spend to much money. i''m looking to spend no more then $200.00 to $300.00 for an upgrade. i would like to go less if i could.
$155: nvidia geforce 7600gs 512mb  (i only included this 512mb because it is only $10 more than a 256mb; generally 512mb adds nothing for performance of low-to-mid-range gpus.) $110: ati radeon x1600pro 256mb   ($85 after $35 rebate) $85: nvidia geforce 6600 256mb  ($75 after $10 rebate)
i think i have made up my mind just wondering if all of these will work with 3d rpg games, if anybody has any other suggestion let me know ( i like more then one sugestion )
