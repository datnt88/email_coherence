hi. i am experiencing a very scary problem with my main hard drive, a maxtor fireball 3 40gb that i bought 3 years ago. here is what is happening. whenever i open a file in my local drive, the disk space would decrease from its actual level (4.36 gb) to 0 gb and then it would go back to display 4.36 gb. this happens whenever i try to open a file in the drive. during this time, my cpu usage is around 30% instead of the usal 20%. is this a hardware problem or a software problem (i.e. virus)? thank you. i would appreciate any help.
have you done the usual scans with adaware, spybot and housecall? and to clear about these scans, so do the scan but don't eject what's found. if you don't... bob
i suspect it's a virus because my cpu usage is unusally high. i will download ad-aware and scan my system now. thank you
