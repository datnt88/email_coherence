<s> i just wanted to know what's the advantages of having a printer that is network ready and one that doesn't?  </s>
<s> thank you mike  </s>
<s> network ready usually means that it has a lan connection device, such as an hp jetdirect card in it already.  </s>
<s> this lets you connect a cat5 cable to it, connect to a hub or switch and print to an ip address.  </s>
<s> no pc is required to be on for this to work.  </s>
<s> some printers may say &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;capable&quot;. make sure if you want the lan connection it does in fact have the lan (ethernet) connection already installed.  </s>
<s> mikey you asked essentially this same question on july 30, over in computer newbies is there something that the 3 responses there did not answer?  </s>
