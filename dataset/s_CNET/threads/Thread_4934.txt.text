i see that this card is not listed on creative site as being compatible with xp. i find this hard to believe. can i use this card with windows xp? the onboard sound i have sucks and i am contemplating buying one of these from ebay cheaply. i do not have it yet so i need to know this ahead of time. tick tick tick.
there are some minor issues with older via chipsets, but this board works with xp and the latest drivers you download. a common misconception is that microsoft will install current drivers... this board has been seen in the 20s since its been out of production for over a year now. bob
