i've built a number of pcs without ever experiencing this common problem, here's what happened and how i fixed it. i built a micro-atx machine for my wife, all moderate components. i researched their power requirements and figured a 150-watt antec power supply should do the job. after installing win 2k, i always install chipset drivers first, then zonealarm, then norton av and hit the 'net for updates. when i tried to open ie, spontaneous crash & reboot. hmmm. after several repeats, i booted into safe mode, all was well, but when i booted normally and tried to run an app the crashes returned. figuring the machine was underpowered, i schlepped off to fry's to get a 350w atx psu. after shoehorning it into the case, imagine my surprise when the same incident occurred. i had purchased the mobo with the cpu installed and figured the assembler might have messed up the install, but before i went to that extreme (there was a piece of tape saying warranty void if removed) i re-traced my steps and realized my problems started when i installed nav. i re-booted into safe mode, removed norton, and voila! problem solved. i re-installed norton and updated, machine ran sisoft sandra's burn-in routine with no problems. i guess there was some conflict between zonealarm and norton, or just a bad software install, for whatever reason. i've heard of bad drivers, bad psus & bad cpu installation causing this problem, never a bad install of software. keep this info in the back of your head for the future. anyone wanna buy a psu?
symantec program has created many problems. lol
i have had good luck with norton, it is that other program, mc affee er something. i installed that on my old sony, the computer would freeze, freeze freeze. i reformated the hard drive and didnt install it again. tried it on my sony laptop. it worked fine. tried it on the emachine. caused this to freeze freeze freeze. i had to stop the process before it could cauze it to freeze, then i uninstalled it, and it worked perfectly. anyone with similiar problems with that virus scanner program? konny
i have tried norton on a few computers and found it very intrusive. imho avg works just fine and doesn't take over your machine.
well i allwise keep a spare. but if it's within 30 days you can return it to fry's john
