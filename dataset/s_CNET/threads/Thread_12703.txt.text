hi everyone.  im currently using an emachines single core 2.3ghz base unit with 256mb of ram so im looking to upgrade. my budget is around 400 and im looking for a pre built system. im into photography editing mostly and web browsing. can anyone find any faults with the one in the link or provide a suitable alternative? thanks ian
seem fine for daily use but a gamer may complain.
your computer specs works for me. you can use it for digital editing. your web browsing will be fast.
