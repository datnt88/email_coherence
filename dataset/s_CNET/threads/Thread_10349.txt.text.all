<s> hi, i was in canada for three days and routinely used the internet on roaming which approximately costs $0.015/kb.  </s>
<s> i routinely can use approximately 20mb of data per day in domestic use.  </s>
<s> however, the un-billed data usage shows me usage to the tune of 151400kb and likewise totaling to approximately 300mb over few hours spread over three days which is worth a charge of $4500.  </s>
<s> can someone help me with the answer as to how can such a data usage can occur with normal internet usage (mails and hotel bookings and wiki and no movie or song downloads) even when i can only normally use 20-30mb of data in a full day domestic usage.  </s>
<s> i am pretty sure that this cannot be my data usage.  </s>
<s> is there any problem with the device or can someone else hack and use the device.  </s>
<s> or there are any other technical errors on the part of the service provider.  </s>
<s> a call to the customer service tells me that they can verify if the data originated from my device.  </s>
<s> however, still i would be sure that i cannot use so much data within such a short span of time on a meager usage.  </s>
<s> how should i approach this problem and what are my options.  </s>
<s> please help with the answer.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> it sounds like you have little recourse other than politely admitting your usage, since they have it documented.  </s>
<s> it doesn't take much to get up to 300mb these days w/ 3g/broadband.  </s>
<s> try to bargain with them to reduce the cost of the bill by offering to add an international data plan for a year if they reduce your bill.  </s>
<s> i know you don't want to pay but if you go this route you'll net ahead vs forking over the entire $4500.  </s>
<s> in general, i wouldn't expect much leeway if your calculations are correct as to how much you used since you knew the rate per kb prior to travelling with a laptop.  </s>
<s> best of luck.  </s>

<s> i dont mind paying anything that is authentic.  </s>
<s> i never have any problems with my credit history or otherwise.  </s>
<s> i knew the rates and i was well aware that i was on roaming.  </s>
<s> and this was not my first experience with roaming and wireless- yes! but the first time when i feel so of the undue excess.  </s>
<s> what i feel though is that- there is some error (software or otherwise)- and my question lies only on the possibility of the existence of such an error on part of the service provider.  </s>
<s> data usage occurs on the kind of usage i am making.  </s>
<s> 3g help me open my email faster but i presume does not increase the data usage for that respective email.  </s>
<s> if i am using 20mb daily in usa and then the next day for similar usage i use 200mb in canada.....i dont understand that.  </s>
<s> i would consider that a possibility over a three day period.  </s>
<s> i believe your concern is well placed.  </s>
<s> i travelled out of the us to vancouver for 36 hours.  </s>
<s> careful to make few phone calls and text messages.  </s>
<s> unfortunately, my iphone was set to automatically check in to data network.  </s>
<s> at&t said i used 614mb of data during the 36hours and that i owe them $6140.  </s>
<s> they cut my data service off this morning.  </s>
<s> i have heard that there is a consumer protection law that allows a one time pass for unfamiliar use and excessive bills for wireless service.  </s>
<s> does anyone know of this?  </s>
<s> any other ideas would be helpful.  </s>
