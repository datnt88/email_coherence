hey everyone. i was wondering if this computer configuration would be under powered or would the 270 watts be more than enough. thanks operating system: microsoft windows xp professional with service pack 2 chassis: 270 watt power supply processor: intel pentium 4 processor 560 w/ ht technology 3.6ghz 1mb cache motherboard: alienware pci express motherboard with intel 915 chipset memory: 4.0 gb dual channel ddr pc-3200 sdram at 400mhz video card: ati radeon x600 xt pci express 128mb ddr w/digital and tv out system drive: high performance - serial ata - 400gb hitachi deskstar 7k400 7,200 rpm w/8mb cache optical drive: lite-on 16x dvd / 52x32x52x cd-rw drive removable storage : 8-in-1 digital media reader / writer sound card: creative sound blaster audigy 2 zs high definition 7.1 surround network connection: integrated high performance intel ethernet adapter
if not today, it will be soon. here's why. the power supply is rated for that many watts new. in a year it may lose from 10 to 50% of that rating depending on too many factors. to keep out of trouble i add it all up and toss 100 more watts into the supply rating. those machines never show up due to an overtaxed power supply. bob
just wondering: what are the effects of an underpowered machine?
bob
thanks, bob
