hello. i am having temperature issues with my pc, as the bios is beeping now, and checking my bios beeping guide it looks like it's a temperature problem, and i'd like you to show me which is the hardware that is having that overheating. here you have a screenshot of cpuid:  &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;this is the temperature for a normal use, i'm just using a virtual machine with ubuntu, listening to itunes and browsing with chrome... &lt;span&gt; my display card currently has no fan or cooling system, yesterday i bought a new fan, and it'll arrive soon. but i don't know, i've seen my display card with temperatures around 75*, and it was not beeping... i'd like to know if there's a problem with something esle. thanks in advance.
here i use a laser spot thermometer (the office is full of engineers) and we've swapped a few defective motherboards over this issue. 75c is dang hot. did you try the old cover off, point a fan at the open case test? and don't laugh, i still meet folk that think heat sink compound is optional. &quot;the metal is touching so that's enough.&quot; bob
cpu thermal compound. let us know how it works out. vapcmd
