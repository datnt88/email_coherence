13300	2	262109	2572813	2572688	raketemensch	8/29/07 7:15 am	1.1883717e12	ok, thanks...	i don't really know what that means. a new case for the external hd? and then what? take the hd out of the old case? basically, again: i can't get the external hd to show up when i click &quot;my computer&quot; even when the external hd appears to be turned on. so i can't even run data recovery software until i can get the computer to recognize that the external hd is hooked up, right?
