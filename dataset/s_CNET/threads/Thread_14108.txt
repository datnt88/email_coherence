1642	8	502042	5009633	5009440	vapcmd	10/16/10 7:12 am	1.28721312e12	given a choice i prefer more normal sized hsfs too.	however, the most efficient (coolest) quietest air coolers are not small. and by selecting those units with good mounting kits, installing them properly and careful handling thereafter (don't drop the case hard causing the hsf to shift or dislodge), the medium to large air hsfs do an outstanding job without spending $70. vapcmd
