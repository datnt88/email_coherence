does anyone know of any good quality laserjet printer that print relatively quick and have bluetooth for wireless conectivity? i would like to connect to it using both a mac and a windows notebook. thanks!
i'd look at some wifi print server. i've used the linksys and it's good if not a little hard to setup. not hard but i tried to do it without reading the instructions and it doesn't work unless i followed the directions. i've gone the bluetooth route and it was a dud. talk about slow... minutes per page... bob
blueetooth printing is that slow? how could i set up a wifi print server? what do i need? a special printer? or an adapter for an existing one? thanks!!!
try theirs. bluetooth was a fraction of the transfer rate and why graphic prints (almost all are today) took minutes per page. the linksys supports most printers. bob
are you talking about a linksys wifi adapter or bluetooth adapter?
i re-read my replies to be sure what i was writing. no offense but i use english in my replies. i also try to let you do a little work since it's your issues to be solved. such as i'll let you find the linksys wifi print server and read up on how it connects. bob
many of the wi-fi router companys make a print server which is wi-fi enabled. you plug the printer to the print server and in turn the printer server will communicate to the router wirelessly. each computer that will use the print server will need the device driver installed and you or somebody of your choosing can install the device drivers (the instructions that each component needs in order for each to talk to each other). those device drivers are supplied in the box with the print server that you purchased. as the previous poster said, follow the manufacturers instructions and don't skip or &quot;think&quot; you know more than they. good luck.
