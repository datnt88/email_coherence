hi, i have a seagate 2tb external hdd.it was running fine.but recently it starting to generate some clicking sounds when data is accessed(also takes a few seconds sometimes to access data).also when i turn of the pc its power is not down and i can still hear the sounds. please suggest the solution for this. thanks vivek
since the exact model is not known i can't check if seagate has a power down feature in this model. go to the seagate site and check. bob

notes that you might be able to install the noted title and set it as you see fit. bob
