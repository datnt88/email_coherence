<s> hi there, i had borrowed a 120 gb fujitsu external hard drive from a friend.  </s>
<s> i plugged it to my old laptop on which i had run a virus scan and cleaned off all the viruses. the hard disk got recognized this time.  </s>
<s> then once i unplugged this and plugged back later onto the same laptop, it wasnt recognized.  </s>
<s> i then connected it to a brand new laptop and it still wasnt recognized.  </s>
<s> i tried connecting it to few other laptops and it still wasnt recognized.  </s>
<s> that makes me believe that the hard disk is infected.  </s>
<s> can anyone please help me with this issue.  </s>
<s> thanks, csr  </s>
<s> try plugging it into a computer with a different operating system.  </s>
<s> do all of these computers have the same operating system?  </s>
