to try to get internet access in my room, i bought this on networks wifi adapter. on networks n300ma usb 2.0 n300 wireless micro adapter - newegg.com. the step-by-step instructions on the back of the box say to push the button on the adapter, and push the wps button on your router. my router is downstairs. our router is an older netgear one that does not have a button for wps. it's number is mr814v2. i installed the adapter with the installation disc. is there any way to get internet in my room?
have you tried installing the wifi router downstairs? as long as you're within 100 feet or so of the wifi router, you should be able to access it in your room.
take it downstair and try it. it maybe the signal is just too weak. if the antenna is not connected..then connected it. i know i never connect my antenna unless i have a reason to do so. i don't want other people to use my router for a wifi spot.
if you're using a computer, then an old fashion cable would work ,and it would give you quicker internet access
