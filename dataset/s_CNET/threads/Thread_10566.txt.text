so i was in staples talking to there tech guy, he said when it comes to gaming having a dual processor over 2.3 isnt any faster then dual 3 or dual 3.5. he also said for gaming windows vista 32 bit runs same as 64 bit. can you guys please clarify this?
it's all about the video card once the cpu blows past 2ghz. just my experience talking here. by summer i'll be wrong and we'll all need quad core 16gb ram and 64 bit operating systems. bob
but the quad core isnt any faster playing games then a dual, the quad is better for rendering jobs?
that i've seen where it can make a difference. lots of pundits out there but i'm sticking to what i think are nice enough machines. here's my short list for gaming today. 1. dual core or better. 2. 2 to more gb ram. 3. a current os. 4. cards over the 100 buck mark from this list -&gt;  having said that, my game rig is a paltry dual core 2+ghz, ati 3850, xp sp3, etc. still nice enough but i'm not an avid gamer. bob
thank you sir, you have helped me out a lot!!!
