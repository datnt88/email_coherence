i'm wanting to add 1gb in addition to my current 512mb ram in my desktop...but my computer only has 2 slots for ram and both are filled with 256mb dimms. is there something &quot;out there&quot; that can combine both dimms into one dimm slot so that i can add the additional 1gb i want into the other dimm slot? by the way, my memory is the pc2100 kind.
or a single gb dimm these should do fine:  given that board you'll need either a single gb dimm (they exist) and one of those 512mb dimms, or to get 2 1gb dimm's and have 2gb i'd just suggest getting two 512mb dimm's
will your mother board/bios/os support 1 gig of ram? your ram speed tells me that the machine is an older model. if your setup will support it, then it's purchase time. a 1 gig stick and a 512 stick. but i've also found that anything over a gig is major overkill.
