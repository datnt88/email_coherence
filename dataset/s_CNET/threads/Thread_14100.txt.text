i have an hp d2430 printer that i use with my compaq v6444us notebook when i'm away from home. yesterday, a dialog box appeared with &quot;solution center the feature you are trying to use is on a cd-rom or other removeable disk that is not available. insert the &quot;solution center&quot; disk and click ok.&quot; since i was not trying to &quot;use anything&quot;, i don't know why this dialog box appeared. this printer is just that ... a printer only which works great. how do i keep this message from reappearing? thank you.
try the microsoft installer cleanup utility. found with google.com it can delete those pesky &quot;pending installs.&quot;
&quot;backup the machine first&quot;, do you mean to back up all critical files to a flash drive or a disk or something else; i.e., backing up the entire pc using something like norton ghost, acronis, or pc backup? thank you.
while i have never had an issue with this tool some get squeamish over the tools warnings. your choice on this one.
for your responses. i had this same problem a few months ago, and no idea what caused it then either, but i'm drawing a blank about what i did to resolve it. thanks again for your help.
