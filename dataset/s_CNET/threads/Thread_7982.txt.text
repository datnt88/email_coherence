which laptop is better for a student that needs ilife06 and iwork06 and plays first person shooters and warcraft3? macbook pro 1.67ghz or powerbook g4 15 inch. i will also change the ram to 1gb and the hard drive to 100gb. i also take classess in music technology and archetechture? i don't want windows because of various reasons.
if he already has mac games or software get powerbook, if not the macbook (so you don't have to worry that much about software compatability issues.)
i have games for my old windows pc but i dont have anything but call of duty and warcraft3 they both are mac compatible. but will it work with macbook pro and i also need iwork06 because ilife06 comes with it.
...why all the shouting? since you have shown everyone that your caps lock key isn't broken, by typing the title of your last post, how about showing a little restraint in how you use it? you may find everyone just a bit more helpful. lampie
would seem to be the way to go here. you should not be too concerned about whether the games you have will run on the intel processor, you can always check with the manufacturer before you buy and the fact that a $40 game will not run on a machine is not really a valid reason to not go to the cutting edge. the macbook is faster than the g4 and is better equipped. microsoft's office for mac os x suite will run on the macbook pro as will all other programs that do not rely on the g4 altivec engine. there is a piece of code, called rosetta, that will allow &quot;most&quot; programs to run on the new machines. duplicate posts in multiple forums do not elicit answers any quicker than normal. in fact, it has a detrimental effect. all your duplicate questions, are answered in this post. we also know that the macbook pro has a keyboard that is capable of lower case letters too and has a built-in, system-wide, spell checker. p
