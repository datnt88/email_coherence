i ahve a laptop running windows xp home sp2. i have 2 usb ports and a ps2 port. what type of mouse is better - usb or ps2 ? what are the pros and cons ? thanks. christy
both perform and act the same. no winner. bob
the ps2 mouse is likely a track ball mouse, while the usb an optical mouse. advantages of optical: dirt getting the mouse not a problem, so easier to clean, if needed at all. it moves more smoothly and is more responsive. it is lighter...
