<s> as i ponder buying a printer (for printing sheet msuic and pdf's thereof), i am wondering if i am going to see any real benefit from a 1200 as opposed to a 600 dpi printer.  </s>
<s> any insights folks?  </s>
<s> -- fj  </s>
<s> i'll say &quot;yes.&quot; it was readily apparent as we moved from 300 dpi lasers to 600 and finally to 1200 dpi laser printers.  </s>
<s> in that case we could put the mug shots on the warrants and the clarity was needed.  </s>
<s> in &quot;color&quot; work, you don't need as much dots, but more colors.  </s>
<s> but for b/w such as music sheets, dots rule.  </s>
<s> and what really can make/break all those dots is the paper.  </s>
<s> i can make 1200 dpi output look bad and 300 dpi look great by selecting which paper goes to which machine.  </s>
<s> welcome to the guild of pressman.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> 600dpi fill about any need you should get into.  </s>
<s> of course if your picky or get into specific needs like cad or such, then 1200 is better, but some printers use a &quot;rastering&quot; to smooth the jaggies into better output. the scheme like from hp is firmware driven, maybe s/w too, but canon better models offer the same to get 1200dpi effects as well as others, so more_threads threads the specs to find out how they arrive at dpi rating, but most modern printers are 600dpi capable at least.  </s>
<s> your old hpiii was default at 300dpi.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> hey robert- interesting.  </s>
<s> i got an hp 1012.  </s>
<s> has 600 dpi with some sort of simulated 1200 which i do not understand.  </s>
<s> anyway, can you give some guidance about what paper to buy for printing sheet music that will look better than this not-so-hot copy paper i got at staples?  </s>
<s> hopefully not photo paper?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> fj  </s>
<s> there are papers specifically optimized for laser printing and some for ink jet.  </s>
<s> others are just generic copy machine paper.  </s>
<s> if you are interested in producing a quality product yourself, you will need to use quality materials.  </s>
<s> both hp an hammermill make papers which specify their intent to be used on laser printers.  </s>
<s> i prefer 24lb as a minimum.  </s>
<s> if you examine the surface of laser papers versus others, you can see something about the sheen and lack of visible texture in them.  </s>
<s> this must enhance their apparent sharpness compared to inkjets which rely somewhat on absorbsion characteristics.  </s>
<s> laser toners are fused with heat on top of the paper rather than be absorbed into the paper fibers as are inks.  </s>
<s> it makes sense when you think about it.  </s>
<s> watch for the sale prices and promos and stock up when you can.  </s>
