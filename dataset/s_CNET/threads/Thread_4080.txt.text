i want to upgrade from my p4 2.6mhz processor as it isnt coping very well with the demand my music software places on it. does anyone know what the best processor i can mount on my asus p4p400 (standard)motherboard is? thanks
the issue is that you are nearly at the top end of cpus for that board. it may be time to pop for some 64-bit cpu or some intel ht cpu, board and ram. bob
can you suggest any please?
i've used gigabyte, asus, msi, a few others with cpus from amd and intel. depending on the part of the world you live in, some of these parts may be available. bob
the best processor as to performance without overclocking would be a p4 2800 if you can find one for the 400 bus.
the asus webpage says i can goto the 3.4 if i change the bios. is this right?
thats great. i was looking for models.
the asus p4p400-dlx(865 chipset) can support such, but be sure that your current ddram is of the right speed and pairs for dual channel operation or you'll likely get &quot;not much&quot; of a boost. also, the power supply has to have spare watts to make it all stable and you'll get a new cpu heatsink/fan. and finally the case has to let all the heat out. bob
keep in mind that video and music producing software will usualy useup a most of the cpu cycles no matter how fast the processor is, the differece is how long it takes to render the project. john
