hello, i have mixed up a bunch of pii cpu's on my table here and i don't know which is which. how can i tell which is a 233 and which is a 650? doesn't say anywhere. just a long string of numbers. also, if i put a 650 pii in a mobo that will only go up to 450 on a pii (550 on a piii), what will happen? thanks - fj
if i remember correctly, i think p2 only up to 450mhz. or 500mhz but definitely not 650mhz. if you set the jumper incorrectly (speed set too high), then the cpu just won't work; no damage done. of course if you set the speed lower then the actual, then it will work at that lower speed.
&quot;just a long string of numbers.&quot; intel has a database to match such up. too bad you didn't supply at least two of those so we could have tried it and showed how we determined what was what. bob ps. it's intel.com...
