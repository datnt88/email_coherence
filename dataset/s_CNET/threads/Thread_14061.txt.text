hi! i'm trying to build a different sub network using an adsl router/modem left from my old isp. (a sagem f@st 2604 ) i first connected the old adsl router with my new isp gateway (a thomson tg784n) on the same net 192.168.1.0/24 with a ethernet cable (not cross-over) connecting numbered ethernet ports, (dhcp and wi-fi off) and all went ok (1). now i'm trying to put my pc and the old sagem f@st 2604 on the 192.168.10.0/24 network , but i really don't know how to configure the different ethernet ports in the sagem modem/router, i fear that i wont be able to configure the sagem to behave as a switch(2). (1) i don't know how this worked, but it did. can you give any light on this subject? (2) is it possible to configure the sagem f@st 2604 to behave as a switch?
2. usually you just turn off any dhcp feature and viola, it's a switch.
it &quot;bridges&quot;, but does not &quot;switches&quot;. i will make another run, and try to reconfigure it, one more time. thanks
i thought we didn't connect it to the wan/modem port. you only wanted the hub ports to work? remember that i tend to use the networking lingo so when you ask me about a switch, i'll include the non-switched hub as well unless you write more. when we use these dsl modems for the switch, we would never use the wan port. that's a given. bob
hi bob i'm only using lan/ethernet ports, at this moment i'm able to assign a secundary ip (192.168.10.1/24) to them, and keep the old sagem f@st with the 192.168.1.1/24, but if i change my pc ip to 192.168.10.10/24 i can ping the sagem, but can't access the internet. the only way that can access the internet is keeping my pc ethernet port in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net. i don't know if this is a windows miss configuration or a bad router configuration. my words and explanations, sometimes, may be lacking precision, that is because i'm just starting in the network field (studying) . for example, i'm having a hard time to understand was does the option &quot;enable ethernet m2u &quot; best regards vasco
is there any way to find out if this router as his 4 lan ports working as a hub?
so that's very off in the place of weirdness. all i've ever had to do was to disable dhcp and bingo, it's a hub. bob
ya! it's a hub. no more to it. thanks vasco
