pat you might want to check out tigerdirect.com, i just ordered a 17 inch hanns-g lcd for $129.00 after $60.00 rebate, it had great reveiws about 50 total, they also have a 19 inch model with a rebate too.
here is a really good lcd monitor for $300. a 22&quot; from acer. i got it recently, it's just great for the prize. vga and dvi connect, 5ms respone time. 700:1 contras. widescreen 1680x1050 res. i absolutely love it and will buy another one for my other pc.
