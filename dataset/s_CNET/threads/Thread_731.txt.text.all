<s> i want to play simcity 4 on my machine but it wont work.  </s>
<s> after looking to aspyr tech support (online) it says i need a few requirements (upgrades): requirements: ati radeon or nvidia geforce card - i have aty rage m3 32 mb of vram - i have 8mb.  </s>
<s> 500mhz - i have 400mhz - the least of my worries i don't mind slow game play.  </s>
<s> does anyone know if my old trusty powerbook can accept these upgrades and approx what would cost be?  </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thank you for your time in advance.  </s>
<s> sincerely, lastg3interceptor  </s>
<s> no! the powerbook video card, it's built onto the the logicboard, is not replaceable.  </s>
<s> you have an ati rage mobility 128 video controller with agp 2x, 14.1-inch tft the vram is not expandable. the good news is that the processor can be replaced, for a fee.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure that i would bother with the expense given that i would still not be able to play the game.  </s>
<s> i would be able to not play it faster though:-) you may be able to play an earlier version of simcity. the cheapest upgrade route that i could find for you to be able to play simcity 4, is $499.00.  </s>
<s> that will exceed the system requirements for this game.  </s>

<s> dear mrmacfixit, thank you for your quick & helpful response!!! i think it probably makes sense at this point to wait until i have the funds to purchase a new ibook or powerbook or until my fiance gets her next imac.  </s>
<s> thanks again, lastg3interceptor  </s>
