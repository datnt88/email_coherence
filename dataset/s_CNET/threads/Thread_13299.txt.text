it seems there is a very wide difference in opinion between cnet reviewers and and consumers regarding printers. i'm looking for a aio wireless for a new imac and once i access a review the opposite seems to be the case made by actual users which is confusing. anybody have any suggestions? thanks. jj
i don't have an apple to compare to or answer questions but when i asked my fellow moderators something similar they gave a nod to the canon mx870. it's been nice and my only quibble is it's size. bob
yes bob i have a friend in town who uses the 870 with mac ,all he said was wow it does a great job but it is large.
thanks. one thing i forgot to mention was wireless. so any suggestion based on that requirement would be appreciated jj
is the easiest wifi printer i've ever used. i can't speak about the apple side of the wifi but it's very nice here. beware of wifi experts that hide the ssid, use mac filters or try to get by with wep! bob
it is wireless and as i stated in a prior post i have a friend in town who uses one wirelessly with a mac and he told me it works very well.
now that someone else noted the mx870 let me share one more thing. it has an automatic document feeder or adf. while it is only single sided it has worked very well and worth noting. be sure to have help to unpack or move the thing around as it is rather big but not bigger than my first pc. bob
