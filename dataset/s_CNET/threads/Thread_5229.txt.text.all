<s> ok, well i have a dell dimension 3000 and i am considering a low budget upgrade of the graphics card.  </s>
<s> specs: 2.8ghz intel pentium 4 1 gb ram intel extreme graphics 2 windows xp professional service pack 3 no agp slot, only pci slots available for upgrade first of all, i am wondering whether the fx5500 actually gives a better performance than intel extreme graphics 2. secondly, i want to know if the fx5500 can support widescreen (16:9) resolutions, as the intel integrated graphics cannot.  </s>
<s> my monitor has a native resolution of 1600x900.  </s>
<s> currently i'm using this monitor at a resolution of 1024x768, where i have 2 black stripes down either side of the screen thirdly, i've heard it's an absolute pain to get a dedicated graphics card to work properly when there is an integrated graphics chip already on the motherboard - if i simply disable to integrated graphics through device manager, is that not sufficient?  </s>
<s> oh, and one last issue.  </s>
<s> will the 250w psu be able to handle the extra power that's drawn by this new graphics card?  </s>
<s> but having used both those cards i can write the neither were acceptable. the 5500 had issues that i never found resolved and the extreme was not well done either.  </s>
<s> look around for anything else.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> someone said i should use a radeon hd 5450 available on a pci interface, which was launched recently.  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> do you reckon this would be better than my current one?  </s>
<s> you have stepped into today's cards.  </s>
<s> while the 5450 is not acceptable to gamers, it's about as far as you can go on pci.  </s>
