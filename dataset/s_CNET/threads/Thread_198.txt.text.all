<s> from what i understood so far, it's the mobo that decides if there's triple channel or dual channel.  </s>
<s> with ram memory it just means you have a kit of 2 or 3 same sticks.  </s>
<s> my question is: if i buy 3 triple channel kits (9x 2gb in total) and use 4 sticks in one dual channel board and other 4 in another dual channel board, would they be running fine?  </s>
<s> ( i will sell the remaining 1 stick) or should i just buy kit with even number of sticks to be on safe side?  </s>
<s> it's these 2 kits: this is 8gb (4x2gb), i'd buy 2 kits this is 6gb (3x2gb), i'd buy 3 kits and sell 1 stick afterwards ps: i know one is 1600 and one 1333. the memory distribution will be 4x2gb in p5q3 and 4x2gb in p5p43td/usb3.  </s>
<s> what do you recommend?  </s>
<s> thanks for advice  </s>
<s> the idea of these ram memory kits is that all components in it are tested to be as nearly identical as possible.  </s>
<s> this would mean that putting all three sticks from one kit and then putting a stick from another kit could have one odd stick.  </s>
<s> i've personally had no trouble with dual channel systems buying two sticks of the same pn ram rather than in kit form but, technically, that's the idea of the kit.  </s>
<s> so, popular advice would be to buy what's made for mb and do check with the mb manufacturer for ram that's been certified as compatible if you want the best results.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> for the mbs they're going in ?  </s>
<s> would they be asus p5q3 and p5p43td/usb3.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> the 1333 4x2gb kit is listed in supported, the 1600 being triple channel obviously not.  </s>
<s> and specifically .... this one.  </s>
<s> personally if i was adding ram i'd consider 2 @ 4gb if the ram voltage was std (1.5v) and timings are tight like the gskill above.  </s>
<s> no point buying a triple channel kits with all the dual channel kits packages available.  </s>
