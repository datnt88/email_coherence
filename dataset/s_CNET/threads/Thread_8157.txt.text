hello i use itunes on my computer to play my music. my main music folder is called &quot;my music&quot;. if i am attaching a mini ipod to my pc computer, will it transfer the music even though the music does not exist in the itunes music library folder. thanks for any help.
no. here's why. the ipod has a files mode which you can place music files into, but such will not play. this is by design. to get music into the ipod (the apple way) you import such into itunes and have it convert them and put them into the ipod. bob
so even though i play all of my music in itunes anyway (with playlists) if the music is not in the itunes folder it will not copy over to the ipod automatically. is that correct? and if it is then it sounds like the quickest solution is to open itunes and add the filles back into it again except this time make sure the option &quot;copy into itunes folder when adding to the library&quot; is checked in the advanced settings. is this correct? thanks for the help
you should try that. but your last reply is slightly different from your first post. i may have missed it, but some do get confused over that &quot;files&quot; mode. bob
so if i confused you a little bit, but am i correct in saying that it has to be in the actual itunes folder?
&quot;it has to be in the actual itunes folder?&quot; afaik. here's why. the content has to be encoded with apple's drm (i'd rather not dive into that area) so the content on the ipod is not shared. bob
thank you
