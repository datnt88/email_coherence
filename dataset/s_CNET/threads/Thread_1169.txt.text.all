<s> pc wont come on light on the front does but then nothing, have changed the psu aswell and still nothing dont even hear the fan starting it was ok 3 days ago then we moved house now nothing can any one help, its a emachine 420  </s>
<s> disconnect the hard drive, and try again.  </s>
<s> you should at least get a bios screen.  </s>
<s> if that's been done, it's time to take it to professional help.  </s>
<s> something vibrated loose from the move.  </s>
<s> take the cover off and make certain everything is plugged in properly.  </s>
<s> thanks for the repy but have tryed all that and put different leads ect on aswell and still no luck  </s>
<s> maybe when you moved it, the button got disconnected from the motherboard.  </s>
<s> you should find the chord (usually connected to the front usb) and follow it to the motherboard.  </s>
<s> make sure it is connected.  </s>
<s> &quot;&quot;pc wont come on light on the front does but then nothing, have changed the psu aswell and still nothing dont even hear the fan starting &quot;&quot; what light comes on?? the power led?? if so that means that you have 5 volts at least.  </s>
<s> are symptoms before changing psu identical or did some of them change??? what fan is it that you don't hear starting?? was the second psu a new unit of same or higher wattage, or an old one that you had laying around?? do you know how to turn the psu by itself?  </s>
<s> try reseating the memory  </s>
<s> yes its the power led, symptoms are the same and yes it was a new psuand same wattage aswell as the old one its 340wts, and no i dont no how to turn the psu by itself, thank you for the reply can you help any further pls  </s>
<s> yes i have looked at that and all things are conected properly  </s>
<s> how do i reseating the memory pls  </s>
<s> you said that you tried replugging everything. the memory sticks [or stick] should have been one of the items.  </s>
<s> the memory sticks are held in by a plastic tab at each end of the stick.  </s>
<s> one lifts up the tabs which then allows the memory stick to be unplugged.  </s>
<s> just remove them and plug them back in firmly and then lock the tabs down again.  </s>
<s> did you replug the video card in?? if you want to test the power supply by itself [probably not needed if you tried two different ones], plug it in to a wall outlet [a hot one lol] and with the supply connectors not plugged into the computer.  </s>
<s> on the 20 pin [24 pin on newer computers]connector find the green wire, use a small piece of wire to connect the green wire to any one of the black wires.  </s>
<s> as long as the connection is made the supply will turn on and stay on as noted by its fan rotating.  </s>
<s> the molex connectors are a sloppy fit so with a fine piece of wire one can usually make the connection from the rear of the connector.  </s>
<s> it is simply a logic connection so there is no voltage that you can feel.  </s>
<s> i have even done a bench test now and still nothing, my mp3 player charges though when i plug it in to a usb port  </s>
<s> thanks for replying but we have tryed that aswell and still nothing  </s>
<s> have 5 volts.  </s>
<s> does the hard drive rotate? the newer mobos provide power to the cpu via the 12 volt line [at one time they used the 5 volt line].  </s>
<s> if you have the 5 volts and no fans or anything running you then have no 12 volts, which depending on your computer mobo may mean that the cpu also doesn't get power.  </s>
<s> for this to happen on two power supplies is hard to understand for me, although in the last month or so in these forums i have seen others with that problem.  </s>
<s> wonder if they were all emachines.  </s>
<s> normally if the cpu were shorted and overloaded the supply, all the main voltages would shut down automatically.  </s>
<s> possibly your power supply only shuts down the voltage main that is overloaded.  </s>
<s> i don't think that i can offer much help.  </s>
<s> at this point after you go back and make certain that you replug everything in, the only thing left is remove/replace trouble shooting.  </s>
<s> doesn't sound too good for the cpu.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> you wouldn't be the first in these forums that found the pc suddenly working after rechecking all connections for the third time.  </s>
<s> no the hard drive dont rotate, im totally lost with it now thanks any way  </s>
