i bought a 320gb western digital scorpio blue hard drive (wd3200beve) for a laptop that died. since then i have gotten rid of the laptop but wanted to use the hard drive externally for my pc for storage. i bought a gigaware 2.5&quot; ide hard drive enclosure. i set it up and the enclosure light turns blue. the pc searched for the drivers for quite a while and failed. from what i see on the wd website they don't offer drivers for external use of the hard drive. any help is appreciated. thanks.
no drivers is correct. but i find some forget to partition and format these blank drives. did you prepare the drive?
thanks for the reply. i did not prepare it as you mentioned. how do i partition and format the blank drive? when i plug it in, the pc makes the sound that it recognizes something was plugged in, but no drive appears in the computer folder. thanks again any help is appreciated. fyi i have a dell that uses windows vista.
click the orb, type disk management and you should find it.
