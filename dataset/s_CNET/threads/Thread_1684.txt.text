i recently purchased a lcd monitor (dell ultrasharp 1905fp) which has both dvi-d and vga ports. the video card on my pc is ati x300 which also has both ports. which connectors should i be using between the pc and monitor? should i use the newer dvi-d connection or the serial vga connection? is there any advantages to using one over the other? please advise. thanks
this uses a digital signal. don't spnd a lot on a dvi-d cable. some stores will charge you $40-75. you can get them at newegg or tigerdirect for $20. make sure you get the length you need.
is better in terms of clarity and hence always preferred to vga ones.
my kids desktop looks better on vga. we had it connected with hdmi and for some reason it looks better on vga. all this means is that you should try each option. bob
