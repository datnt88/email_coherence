i need a reliable internet capable machine that can be used easily to send ecards from a selection of ecards available on the machine. i think wireless will be better, but no other functions are required. any suggestions?
the asus eee-pc weighs 3.17 pounds and &quot;up to 7 hours&quot; battery life. i'd start with that if you want a netbook. bear in mind that netbooks have no dvd/cd drives, so you might want to invest around $30 for an external ones. good luck.
since windows isn't that reliable i think you mean the pc. at the office we have about half a dozen netbooks and all have been reliable. the last one was from walmart and they work too. about the ecards on the machine. not one laptop/netboook comes with ecards so you would install some email app. let's hope you are not thinking about incrediamail since that's not reliable. bob
