<s> i would like to know if this device (wireless n bridge) will help to access my games and blue ray player that are sometimes out of range from my wireless router?  </s>
<s> these devices are part of my home entertainment center that is in the basement rec room ; away from my router in the upstairs office.  </s>
<s> all the blue ray content is drm (see google) and is locked up tightly so let's just say no. as to the game, you didn't tell enough.  </s>

<s> thankyou for replying bob!  </s>
<s> i have a wireless router (d-link dir615) for my network and everything is connecting ok most of the time, but my wii and sony blu ray need to connect for firmware updates.  </s>
<s> i have the ability to go online with the wii but also need a method of hooking up the blu ray. it would complete my system if there was better range to work between floors in my home!  </s>
<s> -both have web accessability.  </s>
<s> wii has usb but i believe sony uses rj45.  </s>
<s> my connection isn't always present.  </s>

<s> i read your first post and it reads as if you want to access your blu ray from other places, same about the games.  </s>
<s> this is a no go area or rather all the copy protections and more mean we can't use our blu ray and games from other places in the house with any reliable, published, you and i can set it up with stuff i bought at the usual store solution.  </s>
<s> your reply however seems to have the usual question about how to get the internet to these devices.  </s>
<s> that's been done many many times.  </s>
<s> -&gt; since wifi seems to fail you and we know n promises more but doesn't always deliver why not the usual power line hd bridge?  </s>
<s> example at bob  </s>
<s> hello again!  </s>
<s> i did some online research and have decided to purchase a bridge to create a wireless access point for my ent.  </s>
<s> ctr.  </s>
<s> my d-link router will comunicate with the d-link dap 1522 bridge (extending the range)and i will hook up all my hardware w/cat5 computer wiring.  </s>
<s> this will enable my devices to go on line.  </s>
<s> sorry for the misunderstanding; and thanks again for your help... tom  </s>
<s> i have the netgear wps606 which i was so happy with i bought a second one.  </s>
<s> this type of device is really great.  </s>
<s> i paid 25 for it refurb and know why. the setup instructions would cause most to return it but you can imagine i worked with it and it was just the thing for my kid's 360 and pc bridge. the xbox 360 wifi runs 99 bucks.  </s>
<s> for much less i got the pc and 360 on the air.  </s>
