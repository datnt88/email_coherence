10129	4	12341	141812	141219	unknown	2/18/04 9:06 pm	1.07713836e12	well..	thank you v.much for your support.. but could i ask u how to know if the psu is the reason or not?? cuz my psu is atx-300w and i don' know if it good to the motheboard and the processor socket..and i didn' find it in the manual of the mb?? or i have to open the psu to know it myself (as the links that u put told, to discover if there was an overloaded)?? and if i didn' find any sign about overloading, how to discover about lowloading?? and thanx again for your support that came in the right time..

10129	6	12341	142031	141812	r. proffitt	2/19/04 5:29 am	1.07716854e12	300 watts is not 300 watts.	i supplied the toms hardware articles about this. frankly, that's far too slim for the over 1ghz crowd. the other issue is that with time, the capacity dwindles from what it did have to 20 to 50% less in about 1 to 2 years. this is why you oversize the power supply. there is no downside to fitting a larger psu. there is plenty of downsides to a small power supply. by fitting the small psu, you not only get all sorts of issues, reboots and more, but stress the motherboard capacitors more than were needed. this ages the entire machine faster. it's not the money. consider  is just 16 bucks. i have a few of this model because i like the fan and airflow placement. the office p4 1.7 ghz machines have the 13 buck  but that's because that can with the case for 20 bucks. the issue with that unit is we needed to add one more fan to keep the cpu area cool. bob

10129	9	12341	143341	142910	unknown	2/20/04 12:32 am	1.07723712e12	i'm confused..	i'm really confused now and i don' know what to change now and where is the problem???!!! should i replace the psu with 400watt insted of the 300watt that i have?? or should i buy a new motherboard insted of the 1 that i have?? cuz i can' change both of them.. and as i said b4 that i opened the psu and there was no sign for overloading.. and about the caps in the mb.. i don' know if they still good or not.. cuz they looking good..
10129	10	12341	143381	142910	tom aikman	2/20/04 3:15 am	1.0772469e12	confusion?	you have an issue that can have at least 2 possible causes. if the caps(round, cylinder-like pieces)on the motherboard look ok(no bulging or crusting)then personally i would replace the psu. you should replace the psu anyways because it is light on power as bob has noted. am i getting through now? good luck!
10129	11	12341	145690	142910	unknown	2/21/04 3:40 pm	1.077378e12	last question..	another thing i wanna tell u about... that my problem was finished while i was posting messages to you and comes again now.. and now when i keep restart to open the pc,it shows me a message tell me &quot;af128d-gh f1&quot; is this message refer to somthing?? and i wanna tell u that most friends of mine have p4 too and have psu 300watt & 250watt and don' have my problems.. why??

10129	17	12341	148694	148655	r. proffitt	2/23/04 2:48 pm	1.07754768e12	tell more about the system.	far too many pcs are flighty at top speed. while i feel this is a warranty issue, if you can't then try: 1. one stick of ram. does one of what you have work? 2. drop the fsb speed from 133 or 266 to 100 or 200 mhz. 3. bios safest defaults. 4. the bios must be uptodate. this one is snagging too many. bob
