i need a new motherboard, i'm falling down on atx intel 775 and i need 8 gb ram support, 2x pcixpress (for future crossfire use) what's a nice cheap one? i've tried looking for myself, but it's imposible to find anything in the jungle of close to similar names. i liked the p5kpl, but there are about 20.000 of them and i alwasy end up with a micro atx or 4 gig max or no cf option. all in all i hope to take advantage of all the ppl in here that know these boards and hopefully you can help.
note the footnote about memory on windows 32.
for crossfire, you'll have to get a mobo based on intel p45 or x48/x58 chipsets. p45 is the least expensive option. asrock p45xe, $95:  msi p45-neo2-fr, $120 ** recommended:  asus p5q-pro, $120 ** recommended:  gigabyte ga-ep45-ud3p, $135:  gigabyte ga-ep45t-ds3r (ddr3), $130:
engine.   vapcmd
