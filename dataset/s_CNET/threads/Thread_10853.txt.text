i have a gateway computer a couple of years old. recently my monitor started to get blurry adjusted the setting but nothing seems to help. is there anyway to get it back to the default setting, thinking that it may be the setting that are wrong? does anybody have an idea of what it might be? or is it just a bad monitor? thanks for any help i get!!!
hooking a different monitor to your computer. if that monitor is clear than your monitor is bad. if the other moinitor is still fuzzy than it's either your motherboard or a video card (if it has one). good luck! and life goes on... jack
my dad's monitor was getting black lines on his monitor where the screen was fuzzy. he replaced the graphics card and it was fixed. i suggest that you probably test whether or not it is the monitor
didnt mention i did hook up another monitor, that is how i am able to still use it, and it is working great! so do you know of anyway to set the monitor back to the default settings? thanks for you help!!!
info as you can provide. no, i don't think the monitor can be fixed. maybe degausing it will work, need a shop for that. they are pretty cheap (of the crt type). flat panels now close to $150. good luck. and life goes on... jack
