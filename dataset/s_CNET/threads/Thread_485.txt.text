my motherboard is a gigabyte ga-965p-ds4. all information about sata hotswapping is very unclear: does this motherboard support sata hotswapping? that is, does it have the ability to detect if you connect a external harddrive with sata-ii connector, to the sata port (through an e-sata connector at the back of my case, that is connected directly to one of the motherboard's sata ports). if i try in linux, nothing happens. if i try in windows, nothing happens either. and if i disconnect it while in windows, it crashes. so i assume that either my linux and windows will need some drivers to support e-sata hotswapping, or the motherboard just doesn't support it. does anyone know what the deal is, and how i can get it to work? i can connect the external hd through usb2.0 of course, but sata is much faster, i want to play games from this hd and still have the ability to disconnect it from my pc and connect it again without rebooting.
technically no. this is done all in drivers. if an owner missed a driver or has an outdated bios that the driver needed then it fails. i have not researched your board but the number of times i encounter a missing driver is nearly 100% of the time. bob
back a long time ago it was thought it was when you didn't tell the os you were going to remove a drive. today you see this in the no-support zone. for windows you'll have to eject the drive prior to removal. bob
can i hot swap a external hard drive using a sata cable?
hot swap would need some additional software to pull it off. esata supports hot plug just like usb but is that all you need? if i'm not reading minds here please correct me what you think how swap is. bob
