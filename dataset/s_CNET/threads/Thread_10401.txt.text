i am running xp home msi 875p neo3 f pen 4 2.8 ghz 1 gig memory 2 x maxtor l01m120 120 gb sata hdd all-in-wonder 9800 hp dvd 420i memorex cd/dvd rom i somehow deleted the raid drivers and now my cd roms will not work. device manager gives me a code 41 under the cd rom drives. windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device. (code 41) under the scsi/raid controllers, i get this: windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (code 19) i cannot reinstall win xp without a cd rom drive and cannot install drivers without redoing xp? completely at a loss. this is my baby, i built her in 2003, and i can't fix her for the 1st time!
read  as to those drivers, such will be on the motherboard cd. use their instructions on how to reinstall after you delete those noted filters. bob
my cd rom drives aren't working.
if not then i'll wait. bob
i just finished trying to delete the hkey-... but my computer would not allow it to be deleted.
you may need to take ownership of the key or it's parent key. bob
