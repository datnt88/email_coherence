<s> i sent in rebate form and invoice for $500, they first denied receiving it, then they denied the invoice was included, and it was voided.  </s>
<s> their rebate vendor, and alienware, are scammers.  </s>
<s> i filed with the ftc and attorney general florida.  </s>
<s> dont buy from alienware, they will rip you off !!!!!  </s>
<s> do you like your computer?  </s>
<s> thanks for the info aws!  </s>
<s> -jdm  </s>
<s> alienware makes an awesome gamers delight!  </s>
<s> how could someone not like to have one?  </s>
<s> haha  </s>
<s> and i don't do server/professional, nor do i know where to obtain a decent mips isa os, nor do i care to find out i wouldn't like an alienware, or any botique computer for that matter also to alienwaresucks...um, is it possible that it got lost in the mail?  </s>
<s> purchased 11/04, received 12/04.  </s>
<s> mailed rebate form & original receipt via certified mail in dec.  </s>
<s> according to the rebate form &quot;please wait 12-24 weeks while we process your rebate&quot;.  </s>
<s> waited...no check.  </s>
<s> called and was told the rebate form was rec'd 1/3/05, but no &quot;receipt&quot; was enclosed.  </s>
<s> i've read of several others with this same story.  </s>
<s> we are considering a class action lawsuit (any lawyers interested?). the system may be good, but when a company advertises a price *post* rebate, it really puts a bad taste in my mouth to have to turn on the pc every day and look at it every day knowing that alienware has my $500 and the $500 of many others...  </s>
