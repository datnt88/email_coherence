not to duplicate discussions about how to install windows but can you reveal to the forum about how you get the drivers after you install windows?
i went to nvidia website and tried downloading it from there.
not only must one succeed to download but also install them. i'm left to wonder if the machine's maker has some installation document or &quot;what to do after you install windows.&quot; i'm also wondering why nvidia and not emachines.com it's not automatic and varies with each machine. bob
