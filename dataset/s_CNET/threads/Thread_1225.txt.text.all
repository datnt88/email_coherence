any advice on who makes the quietest external drive? 
200 gb minimum. 
sounds like seagate and western digital get good reviews, but no reviews specifically include noise level as a criteria. 
my rocket pod was really loud. then it died. 
put one together..there are lots of enclosures to choose from. 
just get one with a fan. 
and life goes on... jack 
or maxtor
