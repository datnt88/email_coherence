hi all, ok, i have rcn's &quot;10&quot; speed internet, a toshiba pcx 2500 cable modem, a phone router from vonage, and a wgr 614v6 wireless router, wired in that order. here's the problem: when there is a power failure (doesn't happen often, but . . .), after the power comes back on the wireless connection on my laptop says the signal is there but it doesn't actually work. i have to recycle the modem/routers one at a time in wired order to get things back to normal. is there a way to do something so i wouldn't have to do that (in case the power goes off when i'm not around and neighbors using the wifi can get on)? also this pcx 2500 modem, i pay $3 to rcn for it, it's 2 years old at least, is this thing up to date technology? thank you -- fj
at this point you should look at the smallest ups units you can find for those parts. since we are looking at such small power usage, the ups may be the cheap cure. bob
it's all part of the same reworking of the wifi setup but the power failure i thoguht was a different subject/ quesiotn, hope that is ok. i will look into the ups, maybe there is a small one for those 3 itmes - fj
yes there are power sequencers like  but an ups is cheap. and here is cheaper than new routers or modems. bob
