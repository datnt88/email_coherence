<s> i rent a room in a house for 3 and i always get this feeling that someone is snooping around my external hd by plugging the hd into their laptop when i am not home.  </s>
<s> how can i password protect the hd or show only certain files?  </s>
<s> encrypting a 250 gig hd sounds like it takes forever so perhaps it is not a considered option?  </s>
<s> is that you must deny phyical access.  </s>
<s> sadly, given physical access, there is little you can do.  </s>

<s> you could password protect sensitive files but going beyond to encryption can be really dangerous if you forget the pw or the disk becomes corrupt.  </s>
