i rent a room in a house for 3 and i always get this feeling that someone is snooping around my external hd by plugging the hd into their laptop when i am not home. 
how can i password protect the hd or show only certain files? 
encrypting a 250 gig hd sounds like it takes forever so perhaps it is not a considered option? 
is that you must deny phyical access. 
sadly, given physical access, there is little you can do.

you could password protect sensitive files but going beyond to encryption can be really dangerous if you forget the pw or the disk becomes corrupt.
