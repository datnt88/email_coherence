do i need to do anything with it or are the setting out of the box fine? i just recently built my first computer and i just want to know.
bios setting con be tweaked for some benefit. also, changed to better what is connected and/or allow some speed improvements. any changes should be done and then allow some time to see if they are, &quot;stable&quot; and continue their use. provided your mtrbd. is easily bios friendly, take each change one step at a time or deemed prudent, don&quot;t go hogwild. experiment if you like, just be aware if it hangs or freezes too often the bios change is to great or incompatible for that level, return to safer levels. also, consider some bios setting provides, is fast, medium, or slower system setting which is another way of saying, going all out or play it safe. tada -----willy
i might try overclocking sometime later, but for now would stock setting be fine? are they potentially harmful to my components other then the fact i'm not getting all the speed i could be getting?
stock or default setting will do fine. like i mentioned, if you experiment, just find a stable and sustainable level that everything seems to work, ok. stock setting are also called the &quot;default&quot; setting, though you may need to tweak abit for some device if required and that becomes your &quot;norm&quot;. don't get to caught-up in bios setting, they are pretty straight-forward and make sense once you get in under your belt. your manual or download one from the system or mtrbd. support website usually give details on bios settings. tada -----willy
thank you, that clears up everything for me.
