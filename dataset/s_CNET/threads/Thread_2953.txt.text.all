<s> win xp, 1.7 ghtz, 512ram, 60gb boot drive and 120gb slave.  </s>
<s> i have itunes on both drives.  </s>
<s> i want many songs on my 120gb slave but not on the boot drive.  </s>
<s> every time i put songs on the slave they are automatically copied onto the boot drive. is there a simple way to avoid this?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> you probably have the option enabled in itunes to copy songs to the itunes folder when you add them to the library.  </s>
<s> disable that, and make sure you place the itunes folder in the correct location and you should be all set.  </s>
<s> thank you for the reply.  </s>
<s> i checked, and this selection: &quot;copy files to itunes music folder when adding to library.&quot; is not checked. is there another possibility?  </s>
