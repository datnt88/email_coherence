i have an external had that i &quot;made&quot; (i got a nexstar 2 enclosure and a 60gb seagate drive) i was actually wondering how the drive spins down. when i am done using it i click the safely remove button and remove the usb cable then unplug and power off the drive. does the drive spin down when you &quot;safely remove&quot; the drive? or does it matter?
some do, some don't which will make answering how a little tough, but &quot;how?&quot; is that the software on the drive recieved a spindown command. bob
do you remember the &quot;headpark&quot; command?
i wake up feeling so much better. bob
