<s> i mention this as i felt it was something else...and maybe worth passing it on.  </s>
<s> \\\\ i just had a monitor(crt) bite the dust.  </s>
<s> however, before i did the fix, i went in another direction.  </s>
<s> i had thought the video card failed, but it appeared ok. the monitor itself shown a &quot;green led&quot; saying it had a signal but no display.  </s>
<s> after a few minutes, i got the whiff of a burnt component, which then appeared to be the psu as i usually suspect.  </s>
<s> but, the system was up and running and the smell did suggest that, but it seems the monitor itself had blown.  </s>
<s> i swapped it and all is ok. fyi - the compaq 17in.  </s>
<s> monitor was made in 1995, so i got my money's worth.  </s>
<s> it was a used monitor and i had it for at least 5yrs.  </s>
<s> or slightly more.  </s>
<s> strange to me, the monitor was made in finland, i never noticed that.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> about 6 years old and one day smoke started rolling out of the top air vents, i always wondered if i had not been home if would have caught on fire, something to think about.  </s>
<s> one reason many devices, etc. are placed in &quot;metal boxes&quot; is to help reduce the spread of flames.  </s>
<s> you will notice just about all system cases, psues, cds, etc. are metal or metal lined besides the faraday effect.  </s>
<s> the metal box retards the flames ability, but still is a threat if it really unnoticed or unattended.  </s>
<s> fyi - i have seen fires within production lines of some devices during rebuilds(refurbs) during final testing, it happens.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
