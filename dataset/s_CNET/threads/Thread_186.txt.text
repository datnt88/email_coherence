i would like to buy an all in one printer (print, copy, scan and fax). i thought i had settled on the hp 7310, but now i am hearing negative things about the hp software. any suggestions?
you will find negative comments about all of these printers. not a single one is perfect and add to that the number of machines with issues (spyware, drivers, etc.) and you have a recipe for bad feedback on any printer. bob
with the hp 7310, there are some serious problems with the software and drivers. the device itself is pretty solid... you just can't use it because of the software issues:  if anyone here has feedback on how to solve these crippling problems, please let me know.
it's sort of amazing people will keep trying on what they consider to be a dud. bob
it would be much appreciated. kirk
and they all work for me. basically if it's on the shelf at office max, depot, staples it works for me. i'm unsure why. bob
your post didn't have a specific model number.
