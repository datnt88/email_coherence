<s> from what i've looked at so far, i don't see much benefit to these tablet devices (ipad, xoom, etc.) the cheapest ipad costs more than a budget laptop while the most expensive models, along with the xoom cost almost as much as a very nice laptop.  </s>
<s> to give examples, a white macbook costs about $999 and a dell inspiron 15r: costs about $800.  </s>
<s> either of these laptops seem like they can do infinitely more than an ipad, xoom or anything else and are still fairly portable.  </s>
<s> additionally, for all of the functions that a normal computer cannot meet, it seems like a smartphone does a remarkable job (mobile email in your pocket, gps capability, etc.) however, i don't want to completely dismiss them as useless, so i am starting this thread.  </s>
<s> for this thread please post the things that a tablet can do better (or do exclusively) than a: smartphone netbook laptop (i am leaving the desktop out because the desktop is not a mobile device) also, post the things that a tablet cannot do (or does significantly worse) than the following devices: smartphone netbook laptop i'll go first.  </s>
<s> tablet pros: smartphone vs: similar applications but a much bigger screen, making on screen keyboards easier to use (as well as making some casual games more fun).  </s>
<s> also better for watching videos and looking at pictures.  </s>
<s> it doesn't seem like the battery life for a smartphone is as good as a tablet.  </s>
<s> netbook vs.: very few have built-in gps capability.  </s>
<s> not as portable as a tablet device, not many have touch screens and the ones that do often aren't as high of quality.  </s>
<s> a touchscreen on a netbook is more cumbersome to use.  </s>
<s> it probably doesn't have as good of a battery as a tablet.  </s>
<s> laptop vs.: no built-in gps device, lacks &quot;easy to use&quot; programs like google maps (would have to use a browser based version instead).  </s>
<s> unless you have a higher end laptop, the battery life on a tablet is assuredly better.  </s>
<s> tablet cons: smartphone vs: many smartphones perform the same functions that a tablet does, except they are small enough to fit in your pocket, can make phone calls, go into gps car docks, etc. netbook vs.: incredibly cheaper than a tablet.  </s>
<s> has productivity programs like libreoffice, openoffice and micrsoft office easily available (one example of how you can do actual work on one).  </s>
<s> can run most of the programs you would run on a laptop, but the screen is awful tiny for general computing use.  </s>
<s> not many, but some have gps capability.  </s>
<s> laptop vs.: all your standard pc applications are available.  </s>
<s> you can listen to music, watch videos, edit audio and video, use the internet to its full potential, play a commercial video game if your laptop is good enough (not a &quot;play for 15 minutes game&quot; that you see on smartphones and tablets), customize everything on your system to your heart's content.  </s>
<s> with a laptop you can do work as well as leisure and be fairly portable.  </s>
<s> perhaps when everyone else posts their pro/con lists i may see more instances in which a tablet device is optimal compared to a smartphone or a netbook/laptop.  </s>
<s> i can see the potential for such devices, but in their current form (a suped up smartphone os, having to use docks to use an actual keyboard) i see them as being mediocre substitutes for a smartphone (has superior portability) and a netbook/laptop (which run full operating systems and have very few restrictions compared to a tablet device).  </s>
<s> is this thread dead?  </s>
<s> there are open discussions about the post-pc world.  </s>
<s> many are not ready and your post lead off that you don't get it.  </s>
<s> why would you get one?  </s>
