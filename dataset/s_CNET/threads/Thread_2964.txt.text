hello all, i use dual samsung 245bw syncmaster monitors and i've recently noticed that one of them displays a slight yellow or off-white hue. i use the exact same display settings on both monitors. additionally, i tried playing with the settings on the suspect monitor and it doesn't seem to help the problem at all. below are links to two pictures of the problem. these aren't the best photos in the world, but hopefully they help. the monitor in question is the one on the right.   thanks! troy
as ccfl (the lamp) age you see that happen. somewhere around 5 years they tend to move to pink or red. this is why you want to replace these with led back lit displays when they have grown old. i will not write word one about any monitor settings. bob
is worthy reading since it shows how ccfl and some displays are less than perfect in the lighting. now we have to ask how much is a perfect display? i think we need to look at barco displays to see how much this could cost. bob
