i'm upgrading the motherboard and cpu. my existing hard drive with winxp home should boot up when i'm done, right? or do i have to do something with bios? will the mobo homepage have the info i need?
normally when you replace the motherboard, you have to reinstall windows. further, if what you have is the oem version of windows, you can't use it with a different configuration, so you'd have to buy a new windows license. before you do the replace, be certain that you've saved any data you don't want to lose. there's nothing you can do in the bios that will change this. sorry. good luck.
probably work without a problem. if not...you'll probably have to reinstall fresh/clean. let us
