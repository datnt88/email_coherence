<s> hi there, i am a pc novice and need some help choosing the correct casing for my maxtor 320 gb hd. it's about 6 mths old and out of the blue died...it seems to be getting no power, the led light flickers but it makes no sound to indicate power is going to it.  </s>
<s> after doing some poking around i've concluded that my options are 1)pay maxtor $700 to recover my data and then get my hd replaced 2) try to fix it myself for cheap and void my warranty i'm going with option 2 because i am pissed at maxtor and wouldn't trust them again with my $ or my data.  </s>
<s> can anyone help with recommendations on cases or any other advice or possible issues that it could be?  </s>
<s> it's a maxtor onetouch iii 320gb hard drive - interface (usb 2.0) external hard drive.  </s>
<s> so i have to open the drive housing up first to know which type to order.  </s>
<s> i have opened the box and from my limited experience and research, i think that it's a pata.  </s>
<s> i see the 40 pin connector etc... now that i have voided my warranty (yay!) what should i do next?  </s>
<s> i would like to get my data of off it, i'm pretty sure that the drive is functioning and that it was a case/power issue.  </s>
<s> i appreciate your help in advance.  </s>
<s> newegg.com and pick out a nice ide usb 2.0 housing.  </s>
<s> i just wanted to say thanks for the help.  </s>
<s> i went to newegg and bought a venus ds3, popped in the hard drive and was back in business in 5 mins.  </s>
<s> thanks for helping me get my data back and saving $700 not to mention frustration.  </s>
<s> there is something to be said for diy!  </s>
<s> yes, you can save quite a bit in no time with just a little direction if you are willing.  </s>
<s> you did all the work, i only pointed so all the kudos are yours.  </s>

<s> i have e-x-a-c-t-l-y the same problem and i would like to purchase the same case but in order to not complicate things, i would like to know how can i differentiate if my external hard drive is sata or pata?  </s>
<s> i bought it new around 7 months ago and the only information that the label has is: model maxtor personal storage 3200.  </s>
<s> i know the capacity is 500 gb.  </s>
<s> do you think that if i buy the same case would save my data?  </s>
<s> thanks for your valuable input.  </s>

<s> see link below 500gb u01h500 hard drive: 3.5-inch ata re saving your data....assuming the drive is still spinning it's possible.  </s>
<s> you'll just have to try it.  </s>
<s> no way to tell otherwise.  </s>

<s> scroll down to &quot;access and interfaces&quot; &quot;bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect hard disk drives to buses that they cannot communicate with natively, such as ieee 1394 and usb.&quot; sourced from...wikipedia.  </s>
<s> it may not be sata or pata.  </s>
<s> i'd contact maxtor directly or search there site again for the more information.  </s>
<s> from wikipedia: &quot;firewire/ieee 1394 and usb(1.0/2.0) hdds are external units containing generally ata or scsi disks with ports on the back allowing very simple and effective expansion and mobility&quot; see link above.  </s>
<s> ........................................................ dear moderators, i believe that wikipedia is open source so the information i've provided is non-copy righted material and can be provided directly from it's source.  </s>
<s> see link: if i'm incorrect then delete it immediately.  </s>
<s> sincerely, dango517 oxoxox  </s>
<s> i have seen both ide (pata) and sata drives in the usual usb 2.0 enclosures.  </s>
<s> at least it's easy to tell the difference when i open the case up for inspection.  </s>
<s> you might want to straighten that out on wikipedia.  </s>
<s> you can you know.  </s>
<s> i bet you have a lot you could share there.  </s>
<s> if you edit it let me know.  </s>
<s> that shows otherwise ?  </s>
