i am running xp sp2. recently had a virus attack. now, lan has low connectivity and a 169.234.x.x automatic private address for the ip address assigned ip instead of the usual zyxel assigned router of 192.168.1.xxx. what kind of problem is this?
sorry, i meant the zyxel router ip address range is 192.168.1.101-254. i should be able to just let dhcp assign onew of these ip addresses in the usual way.
and you get to either use a winsockfix program or reinstall the os. said fix program is out there on google. another common oversight is trusting microsoft to find all the machine's driver. i'll be short. that doesn't work. bob
i've heard on ecan just import ie settings immediately to firefox after downloading and installing it. what do you think? don't have to be politically correct
you figure out that the assigned address is not an ie or firefox item. that's an os issue. bob
winsockfix worked. i heard about it here. it rebuilt the tcp/ip connections. thanks. now, to get that nasty virus.
