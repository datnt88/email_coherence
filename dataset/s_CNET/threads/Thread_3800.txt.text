im planning to load linux on to an external hard drive (around 100-150 gb), not really planning to use the os for work or anything i just want to fiddle around with it because we are studying it in school. so here are my 2 questions. - is a usb external hdd okay? ( many people say it will be slow because of the bit rate. but the way im using it i think it should be fine. - what brands should i look into? cheers zack
