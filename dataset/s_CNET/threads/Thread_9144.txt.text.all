<s> hi everyone, i am in dire need of a control pod for my logitech z-5500 speaker system.  </s>
<s> this is just the silver box with volume dial and control buttons.  </s>
<s> if anyone has one they would like to sell me, or knows where i could get one, please let me know.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance!  </s>

<s> have you cheked with logitech to see if they have that item available?  </s>
<s> it's possible you might be able to order a replacement control pod direct from them.  </s>
<s> im asuming that you have 1 full system and a &quot;headless system&quot;.  </s>
<s> if so you can run both systems off of one control pod.  </s>
<s> all you must do is make a 15 pin dsub splitter.  </s>
<s> a standard vga splitter (powered or not) will not work.  </s>
<s> you must have all 15 wires.  </s>
<s> you must go to radio shack, buy 2 female, and 1 male 15 pin d-sub connectors.  </s>
<s> than solder 15 wires (the largest guage you can fit) than split those wires in to 2 wires, making a y connector.  </s>
<s> than using an ohms meter to trace wires, tape and number each wire.  </s>
<s> than on the 30 wire ( 15 split into 2) solder wire 1 onto pin one of both female plugs, continue to do this to all 30 wires.  </s>
<s> once you get done let a glue gun get really hot and squirt glue into wires soldered onto plugs to help them hold on.  </s>
<s> the reason this works is because there is 18+ volts being sent and recieved amoung the amp and pod.  </s>
<s> you must have both systems plugged in, this will still allow the same amount of volts to be sent and recieved.  </s>
<s> this is time consuming, but it works great!  </s>
<s> you will have 1000 watts of sub!! the volume doest get worse, there is no power issues like many claim.  </s>
<s> george p.s. this isnt hard im 15 years old and figured it out!  </s>
<s> hey i'll give you $40 if you make this for me.  </s>
<s> i know this is 6 months late and you probly already threw it out...but if you didnt email me at monkeyman93@msn.com, id be glad too.  </s>
