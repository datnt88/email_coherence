i have a sony vaio (pcv-rz50cg), i keep getting a low space error. so i do a disk clean up and that is good for about a hour but then it needs it again. my c drive is 13.9 gb with 159mb of free space left, my d drive is 212 gb with 3.25 gb free space left. i know my d drive is filled with media center files that i can transfer to dvd but im having trouble with my c drive. i try to scan it and see what files i can erase. all the temp files and cookies get deleted but that dosent help the problem. i come across so many files that i dont know what they do and i dont want to erase them and not have the computer not start up next time. does anyone have any ideas on getting rid of mystery files, or if there is a software that would scan my computer and tell me if i need them or not? thanks for the help!
13.9 gigs is fairly small. even you secondary drive is getting full. you might get a much larger drive than your existing secondary and transfer the data to that one and use your existing secondary as the primary. there are some files you can manually delete that might help. all of your windows update files can probably go. if you have xp, these are in your windows folder. if you have your advanced power settings set to allow hibernation, turn that off and remove the file it creates which is about 512 megs. if you have adequate physical ram, reduce the size of your swap file. if you use ie, configure it to delete cache upon exiting. if you use another browser, reduce the cache size allocated. you can also reduce the size allocated to system restore. all of this might get back a couple gigs but it does look like a new drive is in order.
either buy a larger drive or go to your control panel click on (add remove programs) go down the program list if you don't use it uninstall it. you should keep at least 500 meg or more freed up.
grab a copy of this and let it scan,,,see what it finds.  do some house cleaning in the mail area..these files can get huge.
