whenever i connect my 80gb ipod classic to my computer a box pops up that is titled &quot;devicemsglistenerwnd: ipod service.exe application error&quot;. in the box it says &quot;the instruction at 0x00427259 referenced memory at 0x00000044. the memory could not be read&quot;. the ipod shows up in windows explorer but doesn't show up in my itunes so i cant sync my music to it. i have connected it to my other computer and that works but it does not have my music on it. what should i do?
the latest version of itunes? do you have itunes set up to open when the ipod is connected? if you open itunes first, what happens?
the motherboard chipset drivers needed installing. the poor owner didn't think that was it a month ago so they went somewhere else. 500 bucks later and not fixed they were back. sometimes you need to pay to learn? bob
is that easy to get fixed or is it complicated
in their case it was simple because we had the machine and it's make, model and then off to the internet for the drivers. total time was 15 minutes. they were a little pissed about the 500 buck charge at other places. bob ps. your posts are not complete so no one can offer a detailed reply with a link to the drivers i suspect. your choice here.
