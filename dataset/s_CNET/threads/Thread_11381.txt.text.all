<s> i am looking at buying a laptop, and instead of paying the outragous cost for a 80 gb solid state hard drive just buying on with more capacity and having it installed any advice  </s>
<s> sorry but the benchmarks are done and i won't duplicate that here.  </s>
<s> it's simply a matter of did they sell you on the features.  </s>
<s> they didn't for me and i have a rather nice history of many laptops over the years (more than 10) and zero hard disk failures.  </s>
<s> in fact all machines went on to other family members who killed them for me.  </s>
<s> mostly they run over them with cars or dropping down a stairwell.  </s>
<s> funny thing is that the hard disk survived and we got the files out.  </s>
<s> now why would i not use a hard disk?  </s>

<s> i am considering the solid state drive for the battery life enhancement, speed( if that is true, i couldnt find much on that), and the fact that the wirling drive tends to make all laptops i have used extremely hot.  </s>
<s> we have this atom based netbook with an 160gb hard disk. the heat is not in the hard disk area.  </s>
<s> seems like that's not the source there.  </s>
