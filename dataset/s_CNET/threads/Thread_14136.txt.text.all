<s> i have a xerox 470cx printer, scanner, copier, and fax machine that a friend gave me.  </s>
<s> i downloaded the drivers, and everything works fine, but i do not have the manual.  </s>
<s> i tried to download the pdf file from xerox's website, but it locks up.  </s>
<s> my problem is scanning.  </s>
<s> i'm using windows 98 imaging program to scan with. the scanner (twain) works great, but after i scan something the program closes and there is no image in the imaging program.  </s>
<s> i can't print, or save anything!  </s>
<s> i mean where does it go, and what file name is it under?  </s>
<s> xerox tech.  </s>
<s> support says it saves it to the hard drive, but where on my hard drive?  </s>
<s> not in xerox's folder.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i can't help either.  </s>
<s> the details are missing in your post.  </s>
<s> your pc may need motherboard drivers that xerox will not usually help you with.  </s>
<s> tell more, bob  </s>
<s> hey bob, thanks for responding!  </s>
<s> what more &quot;details&quot; do you need? the scanner works fine, i just can't do anything with the image after it's scanned.  </s>
<s> most scanner programs i've used, let you save the scanned image as a bmp file or something.  </s>
<s> i can't do anything with xerox's twain scanner program.  </s>
<s> there is no save, or save as options, and right clicking doesn't bring up any new windows with options. the only thing i can do is look at the image, and exit out of the twain program.  </s>
<s> i just can't figure it out!  </s>
<s> i'm going to try and download xerox's manual again.  </s>
<s> please let me know if you come across anything, and thanks for your help!  </s>
