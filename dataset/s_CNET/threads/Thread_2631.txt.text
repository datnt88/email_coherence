i have an officejet d135 a refurb about three years old. it is an all in one. it has been displaying a message that says no color supply. i have reset the printer, removed the battery for about 6 hours, replaced the cartridges, and sprayed electronic cleaner. still nothing. have any suggestions???
send to repair or begin shopping.
should i take out the battery longer???
does anybody know if there is another battery in the d135
but i found that never to pay off in laptops. but we try it anyway. since you have decided to attempt repair you should already be in the thick of it and scouring the mainboard for this. if not, why not? bob
