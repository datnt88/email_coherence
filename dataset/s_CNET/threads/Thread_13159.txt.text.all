<s> my computer just have a usb port, but i'm intested to buy a dvd-r usb 2.0.  </s>
<s> can i use a dvd-r usb 2.0 in a usb port?  </s>
<s> tanks  </s>
<s> it more than likely is backward compatable, but will only work at usb 1.1 speed, which is very slow.  </s>
<s> you can buy an usb 2.0 add-in card for less than $20 that should solve the speed problem.  </s>
<s> the dvd playback will never happen.  </s>
<s> you need to move some 4.7gb in 60 minutes.  </s>
<s> usb 1.1 is lucky to hit 11megabits per second or about 1 megabyte per second so it's too slow 60 mb per minute or 3,600 mb per hour.  </s>
<s> you can't hit the 1x speed of dvd so playback and recording will not function.  </s>

<s> how will a usb 2.o hard drive work with usb 1.1 connection?  </s>
<s> how much will hard drive speed matter?  </s>
<s> the drive makers rarely tell you if it will work.  </s>
<s> but the same time issue kicks in.  </s>
<s> since, at best you can transfer 3 odd gb in an hour that 700mb of mp3 will take about 15 to 20 minutes.  </s>
<s> it's really useful, but slow.  </s>
<s> answer?  </s>
<s> only if its supported.  </s>
