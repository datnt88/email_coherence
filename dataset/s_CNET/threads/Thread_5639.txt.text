for recording security cameras on your pc?
sorry, i can't supply the names, but we do it simple with 4, 8 port cards from places like geeks.com newegg.com and some dell pc for the host. there are those that make it more complicated, but you wonder why you would build a pc when you don't have to. bob
i have an old 2000 computer with 512k. the computer has at least the minimum needed
that's the card i'm using. but if i recall you never found closure on your old system. i can safely bet your machine might have the same issues. bob
i had turned everything off on it and was just using it for internet. i want to format the system, reload it and turn off everything but the cd burner and put the video card in for use at work
today, microsoft still does not issue an os that you can't install without most systems requiring you hunting down motherboard and more drivers. this seems to be what haunted your last attempt. bob
what did you think it was? do you think i will have a problem?
i shared what i thought it was. i know it's an issue that not many will run into unless they install these oses for awhile. but it's one that can haunt your every attempt. oh, since you are looking at the k-world, be aware that one installation paid dearly for not reading the manual. they didn't notice the exact words and paid up about 1,000 bucks for a tech to come out and show then how to get the video files out. they were a little incensed about it, but what can you do? bob
would installing this card in the win2000 machine be a bad thing? i know bad is a relative term, but if you say this will not work, i won't do it. i have other options (analog)
i can't tell if you will be ok given the past issues and that i never could get across what i thought it was. in short, a roll of the dice for you. bob
i can gamble for $100 and worst case it doesn't work, i still have the card for future use!
