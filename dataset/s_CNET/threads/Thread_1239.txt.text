i have a parallel printer connect to a switch which is then connect to three computers not networked together. the printer needs to be replaced with a low cost option. will a usb printer connected to the switch via a usb to parallel cable work.
-&gt; bottomline? you need to test out your new solution before you roll it out. in closing, a network solution is now cheaper than the old parallel switch solution.
with the network solution. however, it's in a medical environment with older computers without network cards.
i'm running into usb printers that do not support windows 95, 98, me, or any version of windows nt. also i run into people that didn't realise that motherboard drivers may be needed to get the usb to function proper. more information about the os support would be at the printer makers web site. more information about the motherboard drivers can be gleaned from  bob
how will u connect the usb to the parallel? with a adopter
