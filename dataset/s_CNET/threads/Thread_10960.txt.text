let me start by saying i am very much a novice pc user, and i would to thank you for your help in advance. that being said, i have two computers, a and b, with a being wired to my router and b being wireless. a is running xp pro and b is running xp media center. i am also running a program called network magic that helps in sharing folders and such. computer a has a folder containing all of my mp3 files that i would like to put on computer b, and i set it up to be shared using network magic. when i open up the program, i can open the folder, but i can not play any of the files contained in the folder, and i can not drag them to a folder on computer b, nor can i copy and paste them to the folder on computer b. when i attempt to, i get an error saying &quot;cannot copy &lt;filename&gt; access is denied. make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.&quot; does anyone have any suggestions on what to do on how to get these files from computer a to computer b. sorry for the lengthy description, and again thank you for your time.
1. let's say your account on computer a is called &quot;johnny&quot;. do you have an account called &quot;johnny&quot; on computer b and did you set the permissions on the files to allow johnny to read them? that's 2 things you need to accomplish. 2. another downright nutty thing that kills some is that after they get the accounts correct it still doesn't work. what i found is windows doesn't retroactively give johnny access to the share. i have to remove the share, recreate it after i created johnny's account. after this, johnny can read. bob
again, sorry for my lack of knowledge, but how would i go about doing that. i apologize, but i really need you to hold my hand through this process.
with all the fine books and web pages about the sharing properties in windows i must decline giving any step by step. my goal was to share why this happens most of the time. creating accounts should be easy. bob
