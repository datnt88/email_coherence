<s> hello all, i just started collecting and buying parts to build a pc. i want to take your opinion on what type of processor i should get.  </s>
<s> i am looking for a great performance processor.  </s>
<s> i will be doing moderate work and multitasking.  </s>
<s> i am not big on gaming, so i do not want processor that will make me go broke.  </s>
<s> any recommendations will be great thanks  </s>
<s> ...then we can eliminate the fastest (and most expensive) cpu's.  </s>
<s> you may not even need a quad core processor if you're only doing multitasking and work - so long as none of that work involves intensive calculations; e.g., video and audio file processing.  </s>
<s> given that, i'd recommend one of the midrange intel or amd processors.  </s>
<s> intel cpu's tend to be faster at a given range than amd, but amd cpu's tend to be less expensive at a given performance level.  </s>
<s> try the manufacturers' websites, as they both offer tools to choose the right cpu for you.  </s>
<s> (click on &quot;play - intel for consumers,&quot; then &quot;find the right processor.&quot;)  </s>
<s> (click on &quot;at home&quot;, then select &quot;help me decide&quot; under the &quot;tools&quot; heading on the right side of the page.) when you've narrowed the choice down, then start searching online vendors as well as local brick and mortar vendors in your area for prices.  </s>
<s> two notes: 1) you don't say what operating system you'll be using, but i'd recommend that you get 3 gb ram. 3 gb ram is the best amount if you'll be using vista, and it certainly wouldn't hurt in an xp system.  </s>
<s> 2) remember that a choice of cpu immediately dictates what motherboards you can use; make sure that the mobo you choose has the features that you'll need and that the cpu will support those features (usually not a problem).  </s>
<s> hope this helps, paul  </s>
<s> you were a great help, thank you!  </s>
<s> the e7300 is a great processor for $125 and e7400 is $140. the 3ghz e8400 is $170 and will give you top-notch performance.  </s>
<s> (it's as fast as last year's $900 extreme processors.)  </s>
<s> my computing needs are, i think, very similar to yours, so let me fill you in on the machine i bought when my ancient pc finally gave up the ghost.  </s>
<s> now, i bought, not built, but it might give you an idea of what i was saying.  </s>
<s> gateway gt5654 amd athlon dual core 5000+ (2.60 ghz actual clock speed) 3gb ram 300 gig sata hard drive dvd-rw drive multiple format card reader windows vista home premium all i've added to it is a 320 gig hard drive, a second dvd-rw drive and a creative sound card to replace the onboard audio.  </s>
<s> i'm considering adding a midrange nvidia video card, but haven't decided whether i really want to do that.  </s>
<s> i web surf, do word processing/spreadsheets, watch video and listen to music and other routine tasks.  </s>
<s> with a cable broadband connection, the machine's plenty fast for me...  </s>
