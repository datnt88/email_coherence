i have a ibm thinkpad i-series. it has 6gb hdd which is not reliable as it makes noise and has more than 2000 bad sectors. i have a sound knowledge of pc hardware and i think i can change the hdd but i dont know how to open the laptop case. need step by step help regarding my this problem, please. thnaks !
out of all the vendors/makers out there, ibm is the most helpful. they have a support website and provide the details you need. they really do, check there. since laptops vary, i &quot;assume&quot; this maybe one where you lift the kybd. up by unlatching a 2nd set of locks where you lift the lcd up(when latched), check there. that's a guess... next time, give *full* details of what your model is. tada -----willy
willy's idea of going to the website is good. where the hd is hidden varies from model to model and make to make. on my toshiba flip it over a couple of small screws and it's done. john
has its screws on the bottom also. the tricky part is disconnecting the keyboard from the motherboard. make sure you have small fingers. after that, replacing the hd is fairly simple.
