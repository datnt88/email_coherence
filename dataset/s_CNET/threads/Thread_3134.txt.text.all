<s> i'm installing a new motherboard and processor - asus a7v8x-x with amp 2500 xp. i've inserted the motherboard, connected the processor/heatsink/fan, conncted drives and pci boards.  </s>
<s> last i connected all of the power cables and pin connectors.  </s>
<s> when i try to start the machine everything lights up but the cpu fan doesn't start, so i switched it off immediately.  </s>
<s> any idea why the fan wouldn't work?  </s>
<s> i tested the fan in a different machine and it works fine.  </s>
<s> i also tried a good fan in the macjine but it didn't work.  </s>
<s> thanks gary  </s>
<s> the cpu fan connector didn't work.  </s>
<s> i used another connection for the housing fan instead.  </s>
<s> your choice to return the board if thie works.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> which connection did you use instead?  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> i've tried using the other connection (chasis fan) but still doesn't work.  </s>
<s> i've also tried swapping from a 230w psu to a 300 watt.  </s>
<s> but again, no joy.  </s>
<s> 230watt is something quite old.  </s>
<s> 300 watt units are often exaggerated and frankly you should be looking at a shiny new 450 watt unit.  </s>
<s> references: seek some help to get the right parts before you burn them up.  </s>
