<s> i don't know much about them, but i was wondering if anyone knew of any wireless routers with lan connections, were the wireless part can be turned off and on by pressing say a switch?  </s>
<s> thanks for any help  </s>
<s> then i added the wap.  </s>
<s> this would be like today's modern wifi router but with the external wap i could turn off the wifi just but removing the wap's power.  </s>
<s> this meets your &quot;spec.&quot; bob  </s>
<s> they have four wired ports and wireless.  </s>
<s> to turn off wireless you enter the router configuration, looks like a web page, navigate to the wireless settings, and click the off button.  </s>
<s> dose going into settings actually turn it off, or dose it just no longer connect?  </s>
<s> i may just go with the wap  </s>
<s> it's like turning off a light bulb.  </s>
<s> there can still be one leg of the power connected so some existentialist could argue the power is still on even when there is no light.  </s>
<s> then again they could be right and the bulb is burnt out.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> have you tried to connect?  </s>
