i have 3 comps hooked up through a switch. i can't move files larger than 600 megs between computers or i get cyclic redundency, time out, and unable to find file errors. the same happens if i try to transfer more than about 2 gigs of files at one time. normal moving works fine. the problem happens if i try to take or move files from another computer . i get more data through if i take files though. 2 comps on xp pro and 1 on xp home. i was wondering what might cause this prob and if i switched to a router it might help. also, 1 xp pro is sharing the internet connection. thanks
for what you want to do, a router is. get a router and remove the switch. a switch is only used behind a router for adding more computers.
guess you get what you pay for. thanks
