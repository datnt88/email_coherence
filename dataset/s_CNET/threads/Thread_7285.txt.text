hello, i have a small 3 comp. home network (win xp pro). all machines have fixed ip adresses. i have a switch and through it the comp. connect to adsl. it works fine, but as soon as i add my laptop to the lan (connect it to the switch), the lan looses internet connectivity. as soon as i disconnect the laptop, the internet is back, why? the switch has 5 ports + uplink to the adsl modem. regards, mirza
if the laptop has windows internet connection sharing option enabled, its fixed ip address will cause problems.
why the static ipaddresses? did your isp provide you with those numbers? if they provide you only one ipaddress, then you better have a router after your modem. your switch is not going to help you. if you have one ipaddress from your isp, does your modem have router function? you don't really need a switch unless you don't have enough ports on the router for all your computers which possibly is your case. more info please.
don't have ports in adsl modem, that's why i use a switch... don't know why i use static ip adresses, my switch has 5 ports + uplink... regards, mirza
you need a router, unless your modem has router functionality. you could set up an ics, but it just complicates the setup. if you want a wired router, find one that will have enough ports to accommodate all your computers. if you want a wireless router, you should be able to find one with at least 3 or 4 ports to accommodate your wired computers. you can also connect your switch to the router make room for more computers.
since you mentioned you only have one port on your modem, i'm pretty sure it does not have router function. you need the router to give you more than one local ipaddress on your multiple computers. the router serves as a nat/dhcp and knows which of your many computer made the request for a certain internet page.
