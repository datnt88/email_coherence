<s> two of the three optoma ep720 projectors we run in our training rooms have recently started displaying badly pixelated images, one worse than the other and the third is ok. i have tried adjusting the resolution of the laptops and the projectors - no joy! to prove the issue, i finally disconnected the laptop from the projector then restarted it with the laptop still disconnected - the result is that the projected 'image' is still badly pixelated.  </s>
<s> to my non-techie brain this shows that the problem is with the projector and not the laptop. the possible soutions are to either repair or replace the projectors - methinks the latter will be quicker and cheaper and a lot less heartache considering we have three courses starting on monday!!!! any advice would be greatly appreciated!! tb  </s>
<s> if you happen to have a service contract for these projectors, i'd call them first.  </s>
<s> if you happen to still have warranty on them, i'd call them also.  </s>
<s> if you don't, i'd call the shop where you bought them or optoma tech support to see what they advice.  </s>

<s> unfortunately, these projectors are a good 5 years + old (outside any warranty).  </s>
<s> we've gone for the replacment option as we were up against the wire.  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply.  </s>
