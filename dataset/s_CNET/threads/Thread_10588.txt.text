while you have your machine there, i don't know much about it. tell more. bob
after doing some more google searching and reading some post from other people with this porblem on the quake tech website (who would have known) i found some post with the same problem and they said that the game needs at least 512mbs of gpu ram to run in ultra so just now i went back and turned settings on high to see if it work and it did. so i guess ill just have to go get another card for sli thanks anyways guys, nick
maybe you missed it. here's what you should do. with each new post... note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
hey i just got quake 4 too and i think he is right since when you go to change it to the uq setting it give you some msg saying you need at least 500 mb of graphic mem or something like that i dont know tho since i would never be able to play it in uq.
it would be great if the original poster would supply more machine details. some don't want help, even when they ask for it. bob
