<s> to give you some perspective to this poll, read this cnet article: ballmer: office for ipad to follow touch version for windows would you use microsoft office if it were available on an android tablet or ipad?  </s>
<s> -- most definitely.  </s>
<s> -- possibly.  </s>
<s> -- never.  </s>
<s> -- i'll have to wait and see how well it works on those devices first.  </s>
<s> place your poll votes here:  </s>
<s> if i'm going to do anything serious with a word processor or spreadsheet, i want a desktop or laptop.  </s>
<s> doing much typing on anything smaller is an exercise in masochism.  </s>
<s> i switched to libreoffice (originally called staroffice, later called openoffice, and now called libreoffice) a decade ago, and i am happy that i did.  </s>
<s> why on earth would i switch to an inferior product which costs more?  </s>
<s> definitely on my ipad.  </s>
<s> probably not on my android phone.  </s>
<s> it would seem frustrating to try and do any real work on a small screen like those on most smartphones.  </s>
<s> many years ago i switched all my computers to open office programs and ihave never looked back nor spent any money for upgrades.  </s>
<s> recently, i discovered kingsoft and i am impressed with the new discovery on my android phone and tablet and both my desktop and laptop.  </s>
<s> andy the circuit rider  </s>
<s> whether you like it or not, i think ms office is part of the business world.  </s>
<s> having ms office on the ipad would be terrific.  </s>
<s> i have two laptops (one small and one large) and i would much rather carry the ipad with me.....it's lighter and simply takes up less space in the briefcase.  </s>
<s> just wish i could have ms office on it!!  </s>
<s> first time i used ms office was on a mac se before the &quot;office&quot; concept using word, excel, and later powerpoint.  </s>
<s> i think ms developed word and excel for the mac before the pc. it is good they get back to their roots.  </s>
<s> i've been delaying buying a tablet because i like the android os, but i like the full functionality of excel.  </s>
<s> i hate switching back and forth between excel and pseudo-excel worksheets.  </s>
<s> if it was free, or very low priced (make that extremely low priced).  </s>
<s> a lite version would be beneficial.  </s>
<s> i use excel, word, pp, onenote, and picture manager daily.  </s>
<s> i don't think a full blown version of office on a tablet or phone would be very useful.  </s>
<s> also if you consider the limited space available on some of these devices.  </s>
<s> i just put together a powerpoint presentation today.  </s>
<s> i would not consider using my tablet to do something like this.  </s>
<s> however it would be great to view or do some light editing on the run.  </s>
<s> this is the very reason we (155 users) went away from microsoft.  </s>
<s> to get rid of their lockin and horrendus prices.  </s>
<s> i use an asus transformer prime running jelly bean for note-taking and viewing documents in writing and editing classes.  </s>
<s> i use polaris office (which came with the tablet) and pro office suite.  </s>
<s> neither app can display tracked changes or multiple documents, both of which i'd like to do.  </s>
<s> my current workaround for tracked changes is to print the document with changes displayed to a pdf.  </s>
<s> i open that document in adobe, and one document each in the office apps.  </s>
<s> if ms office for android eliminated my need for the workarounds, i'd definitely consider it, provided that the implementation was reliable and reasonably priced.  </s>
<s> there may be other android apps out there now that have the features i need, but i'm pretty sure there weren't any available on google play when i went looking for them last year.  </s>
<s> ms office is proprietary, paid software.  </s>
<s> free, open source software makes massively more sense.  </s>
<s> libre office, my choice among many, communicates with ms office formats.  </s>
<s> microsoft is obsolete.  </s>
<s> cost & features would be the determining factor.  </s>
<s> i have been using documents to go on various platforms for years... palm, andriod & ios.  </s>
<s> i seldom do anything from &quot;scratch&quot;, but use it to update excel & word files.  </s>
<s> for the most part i need to create an excel workbook w/ functions on pc & transfer to my mobile device.  </s>
<s> i miss database software!  </s>
<s> if reasonably priced & most of the functionality from windows - yes, i would use ms office on a mobile device in a heartbeat!  </s>
<s> i have had situations where i was standing, entering data read off into a workbook on a mobile device.  </s>
<s> most mobile devices weigh less than laptops.  </s>
<s> yes - the workbook gets transferred to pc for any major manipulation, but at least i got my data entered quickly on the fly.  </s>
<s> even though tablet tries to cover most work aspects, when it comes to documents we really don't have strong, unified and platform independent tools.  </s>
<s> microsoft office is plays an inevitable role on every kind of business on the pc front and if the same potential can be leveraged into tablets i would definitely go for it.  </s>
<s> also, i discovered that the &quot;speech-to-text&quot; option on all my android devices is re-markedly accurate and requires very little editing.  </s>
<s> (my 'old man' fat fingers need lots of editing!)  </s>
<s> i have and use my laptop (windows 7) for spread sheet and serious letter or memo writing.  </s>
<s> i am happy with open office so i don't need microsoft office even on that computer.  </s>
<s> my tablet is only for fast rtesponses, so no need for microsoft office on that either.  </s>
<s> i agree with all the comments about price.  </s>
<s> microsoft and adobe think most of us have more money than we do.  </s>
<s> however, i use my android tablet to take minutes for meetings, and i'd love to have the full, or nearly-full version of office on my tablet.  </s>
<s> at this point, i use evernote to take notes, then copy/paste them into word.  </s>
<s> evernote is great, but limited to simple text formatting.  </s>
<s> i want a multilevel outline framework, for example.  </s>
<s> office 365 is already available on the android platform.  </s>
<s> i have it, and have it installed on my samsung galaxy tab 2.  </s>
<s> too much, too late!  </s>
<s> i have been using google docs for years.  </s>
<s> apple now offers its iwork's for free too.  </s>
<s> ms decision to make office for ipad is simply too late, and probably too much too.  </s>
<s> oh!! for those who say you cant do serious work on a tablet... plenty of great bluetooth keyboards around for cheap.  </s>
<s> (even some really nice bt keyboard cases.) for those seriously working, they already have laptops, using office work alikes to great creations.  </s>
<s> microsoft is a software company, they should try to improve the software and os already in market or yet to be introduced.  </s>
<s> their windows8 is not running as good as expected, vista has fail.  </s>
<s> they should give consumers a good service, their software will automatically make their own place and people will replace others to adopt them.  </s>
<s> a good thing and service always pay better.  </s>
<s> all serious work on desktop and to be free and handy one must adopt a tablet for easy going.  </s>
<s> since i have free things that work for me this may be a steep hurdle for them to overcome.  </s>
<s> i generally prefer other products over microsoft except for excel, which is unfortunately a well deserved industry standard. the other products?  </s>
<s> not so much.  </s>
