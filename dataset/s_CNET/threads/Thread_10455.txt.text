using a dell laptop. cannot connect to my home wireless connection. the signal strength is excellent but it appears it cannot find my ip address. everything was working fine and this just started.
go start, all programs, accessories, command prompt: type ipconfig /all and see that the address is next to the word gateway. should be in the region 192.168.0.1 -- if very different look type ipconfig /? and try using the /renew and /release options. i think you can usually achieve the same by restarting the computer but this is quicker. though your adapter may be showing a good signal, this kind of error can be caused by reception issues. if it persists, test all wireless channels for speed and reliability and select a new own -- preferable at least 5 stops from strongest neighbouring wifi network.
please tell more, such as the full message that lets you think this. in normal cases, the ip-address isn't found, but assigned by the router, so the laptop doesn't search for it, but gets it in a message. a possible cause: password doesn't match. resetting the router (turn off, wait a minute, turn on) might help also. that's the first thing to try. kees
