i have a gateway2000 and i need the bootup disk. do anyone know where i can find one?
will serve up what you need....choose the right disk for the version windows you have installed. then put a clean floppy disk in the drive, click the .exe file you downloaded and it will create the bootdisk for you in about ten minutes. toni
do i download it to a disk?
