<s> i thought it was the power supply at first after updating nvidia drivers, but i decided to try msi's kombustor benchmark software and ran the fuzzy and furry stress test.  </s>
<s> my pc did not shut off for the whole 10 minutes i ran it while my graphics card was under 100% load and 101% power draw.  </s>
<s> this threw me off completely and now i don't know what is going on.  </s>
<s> this didn't start happening until i reinstalled bf3 and punkbuster.(pb is for connecting to servers in bf3) i also would like to add that updating my nvidia drivers only made it shut off instantly when graphics were loaded instead of a few minutes after.  </s>
<s> i have had the same setup for about 4-5months and i have never had this problem until now.  </s>

<s> it looks to be in warranty.  </s>
<s> have the maker fix this machine since you can crash it on demand.  </s>

<s> i built the system myself.  </s>
<s> the power supply is still under warranty.  </s>
<s> i am just trying to make sure it isn't something else before i send it out for an rma.  </s>
<s> when it did fine during the benchmark it baffled me.  </s>
<s> you seem to created this when you updated the drivers.  </s>
<s> go back to what worked?  </s>
<s> i said it had already been shutting off when playing games for a few days.  </s>
<s> i figured updating the drivers might fix it, but only made it worse.  </s>
<s> i guess i didn't clarify that actually my mistake. the problem didn't start until i moved into a new place and reinstalled bf3 and punk buster.  </s>
<s> i tried updating the drivers to see if it would fix the issue a few days later.  </s>
<s> sadly you have to use what you've learned so far to make your best guess at what to replace.  </s>
<s> from my lessons in the field i find it's usually the video card if the machine is fine in respect to power, cooling and such. the hard part is the owner.  </s>
<s> most paid dearly for the video card and will second guess you every time.  </s>
<s> that's fine but you have to base your decisions on either a hard fail, swap a thing or what you've seen over the years.  </s>
<s> in this case i give the nod to trying another video card given the story so far.  </s>
<s> however!!!!! be sure to research that bf3 game forums.  </s>
<s> it would not be funny to find folk with lockup/reboot/freeze issues in that forum and then find a patch there.  </s>
<s> i did not do your research for you on that topic.  </s>
