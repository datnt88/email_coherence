i'm about buying a new monitor and i've to choose between 22 and 24 inches. what would be better for gaming/movies, and why? can i enjoy full hd on 22&quot; as good as on 24&quot;? also, i'd like to hear your opinion about this one:  note: i'm from poland, so don't need opinions on the price (it's very small ;)), but on the technical site. i'll be grateful for your help!
that human vision is a complex field. the answer i've found over and over is to go with what the person likes or wants. in watching movies, the usual person wants it to fill their field of vision for most scenes but at times the small screen is better. who needs a forty foot talking head? bob
but to know what is the best, i'd need to spend some time in front of that monitor, and i'm not able to do it. i have no exp with lcd desktops (especially with 22 - 24&quot;), so i'm looking for some opinions which could help me to decide.
one of the specs i look at is the contrast ratio. your cheap displays have lower ratios. given nothing else, i pick by that number. bob
