hello. i am working on this cpu. when i turned it on, this popped up before the xp user interface. &quot;510 - splash screen image corrupt&quot;, it then said that the splash screen image has errors in it, and to run rompaq to restore the default image in the system rom. its a compaq cpu. please help thanks
well from what i remember of compaq's they offer updates which they call rompaq's perhaps youi should look to thier support site for any updates relating to your perticular problem.
too bad you can't go to f10 setup or bios otherwise and turn off &quot;silent boot&quot; which displays the bios splash screen logo. the rompaq usually is a set of floppies that give you this access if the normal &quot;setup&quot; is installed/availible at boot.
