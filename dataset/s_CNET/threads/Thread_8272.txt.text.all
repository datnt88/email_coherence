<s> been thinking of getting a tablet for a few weeks now and am having trouble deciding between the ipad and the galaxy tab.  </s>
<s> i've played around with the note and i quite like the tablet (not sure how different the note is to the galaxy tab other then the specs and a flashy stylus), but it's a little out of my price range, however i have some reservations about the galaxy tab.  </s>
<s> i currently own an android phone, the htc one x and have some disappointing issues with it and because of that i am uncertain if it want to invest in an android tablet, although i am beginning to think it's an issue with htc, not android.  </s>
<s> i intend to use the tablet for reading e-books, music, browsing and maybe the occasional video. the one of the problems i have with my htc is getting media on to the phone.  </s>
<s> i know you can mount them like a disc drive but i used htc's own manager which is utterly horrible, which is one of the reasons why the ipad seems to be a better as itunes is a lot easier to use as it's left a bad stain on my experience with android.  </s>
<s> with the samsung, i like being able to add more storage through the use of sd card as i don't really like being locked into just one amount of storage.  </s>
<s> in the end, i am stuck in the middle with this decision and cannot decide, so looking for a little advice.  </s>
<s> i don't want to repeat the long discussion about media encoding but what i've seeing are folk expecting these tablets to play whatever you can on a pc. nothing is farther from reality. the ipad is a little better at this as you funnel most content through itunes and it can re-encode content (sometimes) and if you get content from the store, it's encoded properly which makes some folk think it's a better player.  </s>
<s> and a runner up is the kindle fire.  </s>
<s> it's not that expensive compared to the others and with amazon prime you get a lot of content.  </s>
<s> about the media card.  </s>
<s> with streaming and more, that idea is losing ground.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> video playback on a tablet is something i would do rarely, i'm of the opinion that if i want to watch a movie i have a perfectly good tv not far away, it's something i would do say while travelling.  </s>
<s> i know the galaxy tab supports more file types but a friend with an ipad has shown me a useful app that will do the same thing.  </s>
<s> i know adding/deleting music is so much easier on itunes, add the song and sync, i tried to add a song (just one) to htc sync manager and the program tried to add the entire folder.  </s>
<s> as for data storage, i agree with you bob, there are a lot more services out there like the icloud and dropbox that i could use if need be.  </s>
<s> so far the ipad is seeming a better option for me.  </s>
