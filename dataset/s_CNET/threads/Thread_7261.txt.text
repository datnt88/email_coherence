my printer has black ink on bottom of printer. it is on the right side of printer.it is pretty thick.should i try to clean it up? thanks,edward
i put a shopping bag in the black office waste basket and then used tissues to sop up the excess. after about 15 minutes it looked better. the printer still works fine. bob
thanks again bob,you have helped me again!! edward
