i need a desk-top but i need no bells and whistles. speed is not terribly important nor is memory. 100g hd and a dozen or so ram is all i'll need. i do not game nor will i ever. i need xp office and powerpoint. other than that only a 17'' flat-screen monitor and a cd-burner completes my package. i don't need any technical support either. i really don't need a warranty. i've used a presario 700 laptop for the last four years and had no problems. thus, should i purchase a new budget desktop or go to ebay and buy the separate components? tnanks in advance... cavaleer
here's one for $750 with dual core cpu that meets your specs:  it's pretty hard to build your own cheaper than the $400 specials. the windows os is $100 so $300 barely covers the hardware.  if you're going to build your own, definitely go to newegg.com, zipzoomfly.com, tigerdirect.com, etc. i buy from ebay frequently but no ebay seller can beat the prices of the websites i mentioned for the same new hardware. here's a $470 (including shipping) configuration: asus barebones (case, power supply, mobo), $135:  amd athlon x2 4200+ cpu, $75:  wd 200gb sata drive, $75:  corsair 1gb ddr2-667, $39:  sony/nec 18x dvd burner, $30:  logitech keyboard/optical mouse, $15:  windows vista premium, $99:  17&quot; lcds are the same price as 19&quot; lcds now. monitors always on sale somewhere so just wait a week or two until you see one for less than $160. otherwise, here's a couple of choices: asus 19&quot; widescreen, $190 before $30 rebate:  hanns-g 19&quot; widescreen, $173:  acer 17&quot;, $180:  acer 19&quot;, $180:
many thanks! i don't want to spend more than $700. this will be a true utility appliance compared to what others are doing with their computers. the laptop question is a good one. on one hand i don't want to spend $2000 on a laptop when i could buy the same tools for 500-700. i have other places i'd like to spend that money since my computer truly will be an appliance. on the other hand i will be traveling a great deal in the coming months and i can see the eventual superiority of a laptop. for the moment, however, a desktop will take care of my immediate needs and when/if i see the real need for a laptop, i'll buy one. lol
i just browsed circuit city and i can find something perfect for me for more or less the same price as the separate components. i'll check best buy for comparison sake. i can drive to both locations as well. many thanks again, cavaleer
