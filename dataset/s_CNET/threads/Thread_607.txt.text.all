<s> i have an old iomega ext zip drive, ya know with that plug with the hundred pins.  </s>
<s> db25 i guess??? of course all of my current computers have usb ports. is there an adaptor i can buy to use the old zip drive with my new computers?  </s>
<s> or any way at all to get info from those 100 zip disks onto something else?  </s>
<s> is yours an internal or external?  </s>
<s> your mention of a db25 connector sounds like the external type that plugged into the printer port and had a pass through to the printer.  </s>
<s> if that's the case, it would still plug into a printer port if your mb has one. the first internals, if i recall correctly, came with a scsi card and cable.  </s>
<s> later ones were atapi.  </s>
<s> which do you have?  </s>
<s> sorry for the confusion...i use ext as a short for external.  </s>
<s> anyway... none of my current computers have a multi pin port.  </s>
<s> except for my monitor which is db9.  </s>
<s> all of my ports are for usb, including my printers.  </s>
<s> i need an adaptor that will convert the multi pin on the ext zip plug to a usb plug for my cpu.  </s>
<s> 1. pci slot.  </s>
<s> 2. laptop.  </s>
<s> 3. pcie 1x slot.  </s>
<s> this is very hopeful news.....thank you  </s>
