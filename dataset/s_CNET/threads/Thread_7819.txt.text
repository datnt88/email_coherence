hello, i recently purchased a wireless security camera system. it comes with it's own hub that captures the video and outputs it through a/v ports. i want to plug the a/v chords into my laptop so that i can record the video. a few questions i have is: 1. do a/v to usb adapters exist that would make sense in this situation? 2. do a/v to firewire adapaters exist? 3. what kind of software would i be looking at for recording this on a pc? mac? 4. are there any other setups i should consider? for example, can i simply caputre the video from a pc off the network? thanks for your help!
that's called &quot;video capture.&quot; too many to list here. i'm surprised you were not flooded with options when you went shopping. as to the network, such would a documented feature along with how or else it can't. bob
does &quot;video capture&quot; refer to capturing on the network? or capturing from a device? i have found plenty of freeware that can handle video from a device, but nothing that can capture it off the network. do you have any examples of these? thanks heaps!
let's say i have some video capture device and it is set up to save one or so many hours in a file, then another and so on. said file is then &quot;shared&quot; on a network or off the network (your choice.) seems like you can do this? again, there are hundreds of video capture cards and even more software. it's like trying to find a dollar hamburger in l.a. bob
bob. i'm on the rgiht track now. many thanks
