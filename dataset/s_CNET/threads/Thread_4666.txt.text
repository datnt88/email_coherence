what is the best way to set up a laptop with multiple lan's? i need one set up with a static ip address. can i designate a priority of which lan connection to use? i know i can enable and disable the connections but thought there might be a better method. the laptop uses windows 2000 over ethernet cabling for internet access and is sometimes removed from the internet and used to connect to an industrial printer with a cross over cable in a different location(different building). the laptop is being shared for these two tasks. thanks for your input mike
for that i would consider  bob
i'm sorry for posting a message in others people post, but i thing its related to the topic .. what is the 'alternate location' setting in tcp/ip for? can it be use for multiple lan in question? if indeed it could be used, how do you configure it? thank you
