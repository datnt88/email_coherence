<s> i wish to swap out one of my 2 dvd burners for a lightscribe-capable dvd burner. the dell store tells me that there is no dvd lightscribe burner for my machine.  </s>
<s> true?  </s>
<s> lightscribe burner can be install in any computer but you have to be sure the burner comes with the necessary supported software.  </s>
<s> i am wondering if the plastic drive panel faceplate that drops down as the tray ejects is a problem?  </s>
<s> thanks for answering.  </s>
<s> the only difference may be the faceplate color.  </s>
<s> unless, the oem maker supplies a drive tray panel that replaces the one currently installed, then *any* other drive will work.  </s>
<s> the part that flips down as it were is intended to give way and the std.  </s>
<s> drive tray panel is still attached to the drive you just installed.  </s>
<s> in other words the cases is separate from the drives.  </s>
<s> the drives don't have any special panel that attaches to &quot;themselves&quot;. this should be an obvious feature you can check on.  </s>
<s> however, some pc drives did have tray panels that were part of the case and tray and not case alone.  </s>
<s> dell, no thought provides even the replacement procedure via the support website on how to replace cd/dvd drives.  </s>
<s> follow your model# and see what the docs provide.  </s>
<s> last, if your last option here if there is a spare empty drive bay, use it. the empty bay with it's frt.  </s>
<s> panel removed is intended for other drives, though it won't be keeping with the overall design.  </s>
<s> but, you will have access to your new drive.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> that computer has 2 bays for cd/dvd.  </s>
<s> so like willly said just put the new lightscribe unit in the unused bay. the power is already there, unused and the new unit will come with a sata cable to plug into the motherboard.  </s>
<s> dell support site gives a step by step in their service manual.  </s>
<s> also be sure to go to lightscribe.com and get the latest udates for the lightscribe software.  </s>
<s> lightscribe is great, but painfully slow.  </s>
<s> dell did inform me that any sata lightscribe dvd burner should work, although they have none in stock.  </s>
<s> thanks for helping!!!  </s>
