i recently purchased a tv that didnt specify that only pc input was 1024x768 resolution. the component cable connecters on back are 1080p and i want to connect to that port so my pc can display 1080p. so i was wondering what do i have to get to make that possible? specs: evga 7900 gt ko video card akai lct37z6ta telivison
you need a pc video card with that resolution and connector output. i didn't research your video card. if it doesn't have the proper output you'll need to get one that does. there's no way to change the tvs pc input.
i am guessing you don't have 1080p on that tv. if it has 1080p, i am pretty sure there would also be hdmi connection. what kind of contents are you trying to view at 1080p? you have a ps3 or blu-ray player on that pc? i will also venture to say if you don't have a hd video card you might not have much fun trying to output 1080p contents. just my thoughts.
