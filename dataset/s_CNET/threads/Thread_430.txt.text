one purchase an isa or pci card to run an internal floppy???
but the sad truth is that i don't see such a card. the issue here is that a motherboard could cost about the same. what motherboard is this? what cpu and such parts do you need to move over? bob
ray, check this out. looks as it is for an isa slot.
.
ray: try some wd-40 on the micro switches just inside the flip door. the one on the right looking in is the write protect, and the one on the left is the media sensor switch. what i have found in many cases is that those switches get gummy from the atmosphere and do not actuate properly when you insert a floppy, particularly, the media sensor. if this stays down in a stuck position, the drive thinks it has a 720 disk, but your command has told it that it was a 1.44, therefore you may get a message &quot;cannot read, disk not formatted etc.&quot; a little wd-40 on the finger nubs with working a disk in and out frees up these switches, and often puts the drive back in service. its worth a try, i fixed one this past weekend for a friend. norm
also check the mother board floppy plug slot to see if a pin is bent down against another pin, sometimes these slots are not indexed (missing a pin) and some one uses a indexed cable (blank space on the cable connector) bending the pin down while forcing the cable in the slot. norm
this idiot was building a new computer and setting up the old one for another user. the old one was using an ls120 [ide] drive as the floppy. this was needed for the new computer which had the old hard drive with quickbooks on it. used it to back up quickbooks. now two years ago, this same idiot disabled the floppy controller because at that time the system didn't have a floppy drive. guess what happened when i enabled the floppy controller in the bios. now i have an isa controller that can handle a bunch of floppies. anyone need it??
