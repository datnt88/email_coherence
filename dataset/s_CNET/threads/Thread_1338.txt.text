i am having a problem with my hard drive and am afraid it will fail. i have a second hard drive in my system that was set up to shadow the c drive. i disabled that second drive after i received the computer, so this drive is essentially new. do i have to do anything to the second drive, since it does have a couple of files on it to be able to use it as a primary drive? any help would be appreciated. i am running windows xp home edition.
use a program like norton ghost to duplicate your current drive.
so using this program will reformat the second drive and make it bootable? i will be retiring the c drive as soon as i get d up and running. thanks for the help. jan
you download it from the drive's maker. example at  in that case, maxblast copied it all over. bob
the other drive in my system is the same age and brand as the one with the problem. it just hasn't been used, because i disabled the shadowing. (kinda wish now that i hadn't.) so there is no copy program that i am aware of. i'll dig out the disk and take a look.
i use another called g4u but some find it too hard to use (no gui.) if you had shared the make of the drives i might have found that maker's free copy software. but you can look too. bob
thanks for the help. i appreciate the time taken to answer my questions. i'll drop a note when i get the job done.
