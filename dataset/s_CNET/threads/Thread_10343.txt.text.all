if you ever happen to replace your computer's motherboard with a new one that is the same model as the one you replaced, do you still have to worry about re-activating windows? 
windows will know there's been a change. 
worst case scenario is you won't be able to re-activate without a call to ms. much might depend on what issue of windows you have. 
such as oem types are said to be locked to a motherboard but i think builders who offer warranties know how to get around that if they have to replace the board. 
the versions of windows i have are not ever in doubt about the license so reactivation is silent and always works.
