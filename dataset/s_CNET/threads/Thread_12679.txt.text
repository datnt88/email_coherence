im using windows xp. i replaced a motherboard from an hp computer model # m7640n with an msi 785gt-e63 model # ms-7551 and i am wondering what programs are necessary to run. i am at 50 processes right now and the cpu usage keeps going up and down a lot ( i do not have a virus ). the computer is mainly used to play world of warcraft. please help me
the cnet computer help has discussed this one (often) and the first questions are back at you about what's running and why are you running such. bob
since i am no longer using the hp motherboard , can i delete all hp software, being that my new one has its own software, without messing up windows xp.
few, if any, of that hp software you run is tied to the motherboard. that's proven by the fact that it still seems to run with the new motherboard. the only 2 advices that can be given: 1. only run the software you need. 2. repeating what bob said: this isn't hardware issue, and any more software oriented forum would want to know what exact software you mean. kees
some features such as volume control from the keyboard are done with helpful apps or software. only you would know if you need to keep that app or software. some folk don't want it or need it. bob
