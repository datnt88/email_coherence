<s> i currently have 4gb of ddr2 ram, and an ati radeon 4650 hd, and i wanted to know if i can upgrade it to 8gb ddr3 ram or stick with ddr2, and also, to what gpu can i get the motherboard to.  </s>
<s> i have a 2.33 ghz quad core, and my power supply is a micronics 230w.  </s>
<s> i play games such as the ac series, tomb raider amongst others, high motion games.  </s>
<s> 2 hours ago also, i want to know if i will need to upgrade my power source  </s>
<s> i'd say do nothing.  </s>
<s> there are posts about which list to check but in this case not only would you be in for a new gpu but without a new psu i'd not touch this.  </s>
<s> i'd leave this alone.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> but if i upgrade my psu to say, 500 watts?  </s>
<s> because you might get some dual or triple rail psu and that would be no upgrade. is the usual list.  </s>
<s> and look at the rating needed and then again, unless you know your amperes, you get a single rail of the rated value.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> so i guess it's better to buy a new pc than to try and improve my current one  </s>
<s> but it won't affect frame rates in games.  </s>
<s> if you found this old pc with say a 5400 rpm drive, for cheap i could fit a 7200 rpm drive and the improved boot and load times could have the owner happy for a bit. the 230w psu is just too low to consider any card on the list.  </s>
<s> and without knowing which 500w you have so i can check rails, i can't be sure it will do.  </s>
<s> that's one reason why you hear folk asking for a single rail.  </s>
