alright, this may seem like a stupid question, but so far i couldn't find the answer. does anyone know what motherboard dell ships in an xps 410 if you select a pentium d processor? i know the 410 is made for core 2 duo and that the 400 was the one with pentium d, but the 400 is gone now and i don't know the motherboard in either of them. help?
here's the motherboard's specs. i copied this off of dell's website: socket type socket - t (lga 755) cpu support pentium 4 from 631(3.0g) upto 661(3.6g)
thanks a bunch. i couldn't find it for some reason. would you mind posting a link to the page? thanks again.
dell sneaks in their own little assortment of drivers for their motherboards too. thos specs aren't etched in stone. if your thinking &quot;modification&quot;, be ye ever ready. went thru it one time - got tricked - wasted some clams.
