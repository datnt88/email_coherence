<s> with that said i need some help on this.  </s>
<s> it's time to upgrade but i really am not up on the current tech.  </s>
<s> more over, my price range is limited with a baby on the way so those of you who are patient and want to help i'd more then welcome it.  </s>
<s> i want to be able to play the new pc games so i want decent stuff but i know with my budget the latest and greatest is out of the question.  </s>
<s> i want the best bang for my buck over all.  </s>
<s> i was thinking of going with the athalon 64 3200. is this a good plan?  </s>
<s> (i love playing world of warcraft and i want this to run smoothly) i also want to know what is the difference between socket 754 and 939 pin.  </s>
<s> now i've figured out i probably want 939 pin but i don't know why.  </s>
<s> finally on this topic, what does 90nm mean?  </s>
<s> do i want this or the standard athalon 64 3200?  </s>
<s> ok, section 2 of jon's pc building for idiots.  </s>
<s> i need a good mother board recomendation for this processor.  </s>
<s> again, i want it to run games well but i don't need a ton of bells and whistles.  </s>
<s> i'm trying to keep this as cheap as possible but still good enough to game on.  </s>
<s> finally, graphic card?  </s>
<s> i found a sapphire radeon 9250 for $44. that sounded like a great deal but will it hold up to the most current games out?  </s>
<s> can i run world of warcraft on a high setting with this?  </s>
<s> i've been told the pny verto nvidia 6800 gs is the best bang for my buck but i wanted to stay under $100 for a video card if possible.  </s>
<s> oh, and once we put something together here i'll need to know what power supply to run.  </s>
<s> i'm sure i can figure out ram.  </s>
<s> i have 2 hard drives and a well ventilated custom case.  </s>
<s> and do you need windows xp and a monitor?  </s>
<s> i do have monitor and xp. i have everything i need...a fully running box, i just need a new motherboard, processor, and video card.  </s>
<s> socket 754 is dead (no more from the production line).  </s>
<s> that means replacement (and upgrade) cpu's and motherboards are becoming harder and harder to find.  </s>
<s> todays amd desktop cpu's fit socket 939 motherboards.  </s>
<s> current popular amd desktop product lines: - sempron (budget, analogous to intel celeron) - athlon 64 - athlon 64 x2 (dual core) - athlon 64 fx (gamer) more amd product line info: 130nm, 90nm, 65nm = size of cpu die (in nanometers) - smaller is supposed to be cheaper, faster, cooler, and more efficient, but actual models don't always see all these benefits.  </s>
<s> look for a motherboard with an nvidia nforce4 chipset.  </s>
<s> check newegg.com  </s>
<s> if you are in the usa.  </s>
<s> whatever fits your budget: - nforce4 - nforce4 ultra - nforce4 sli descriptions: (scroll down to the chart)  </s>
<s> i forgot the nforce4 feature chart:  </s>
<s> dfi nf4 dagf (board) amd athlon 64 x2 3800+ (processor) 2gb (2x1gb) corsair xms ddr400  </s>
<s> another question.  </s>
<s> with this mother board: biostar tforce6100-939 socket 939 nvidia geforce 6100 micro atx amd motherboard do i need a graphic card?  </s>
<s> i noticed it doesnt have an agp slot and i really want to use this graphic card: pny geforce 6800 gs / 256mb gddr3 / agp 8x i've decided on these products so far: amd athlon 64 3200+ venice 2000mhz ht socket 939 processor model ada3200bpbox - retail --$154.00  </s>
<s> pny geforce 6800 gs / 256mb gddr3 / agp 8x / dvi / vga / tv out / video card -- $179.99 i need a suggestion on a good quality board preferably around $50 - $80 that will work with these two components.  </s>
<s> the latest & greatest video card slot is pci express x16. video for gaming: worst &lt; integrated &lt; pci &lt; agp 8x &lt; pci express x16 &lt; best note that &quot;pci&quot; is not the same as &quot;pci express&quot; also note that pci express x16 cards are just as inexpensive or even less expensive than agp cards.  </s>
<s> that particular motherboad has integrated geforce 6100 video and a pci express x16 slot.  </s>
<s> agp is dead, and ati/nvidia probably won't make any new cards for it.  </s>
<s> for the price of the 6800gs, you should look at the 7600gt, or an x1800gto with a large rebate.  </s>
<s> hi i am kind of in the same boat ... i'm still using an athlon xp 1800+ with a via kt 266/333 chipset and that mobo does use agp.  </s>
<s> so, got a cheap evga fx5500 256mb card from newegg.  </s>
<s> having problems, think it's the motherboard and/or the chipset.  </s>
<s> so, i'm going to probably be buying a cheap &quot;for now&quot; (like emachine t6528) computer so we have something to use until i can get my custom built re-built.  </s>
<s> then figure out how to network the 2 computers.  </s>
<s> i looked at the motherboard you chose, looked around and found this one: about the same price.  </s>
<s> if you already have an agp card and need to upgrade this may work for you.  </s>
<s> personally, i'm reading everything review-wise i can on all the boards i'm looking at.  </s>
<s> this site and google can be your friends. the motherboard, processor and power supply from my (limited) understanding are the 3 most important components in your computer.  </s>
<s> you don't have to pay top dollar for the latest or just for a name, but i believe it does pay to spend that little extra to get good quality.  </s>
<s> just my .02  </s>
<s> i was trying to tell the poster that his chosen motherboard has integrated video and a pci express x16 slot, that agp is less desirable than pci express x16, and why the consideration of an agp video card on that motherboard is moot (no agp slot).  </s>
<s> sorry for my vague post.  </s>
<s> ...why he would want agp.  </s>
