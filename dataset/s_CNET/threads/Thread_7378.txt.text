i have a cable internet connection in bldg 1 where we have a wirelss internet connection (on a linksys wrt54g)set up for our customers for free public access. i have another computer in bldg2 which is about 600 feet away with clear access no trees nothing. i cannot run cable underground or on telephone poles i want to use the wireless internet connection for bldg2 so my big question is how can i expand my wireless signal to reach bldg 2 and be strong ?? thanks for your help and input ahead of time !! ehunt32
and the fcc limits the power in any direction. if this is a diy setup on your own land you can get away with better antennas but rain will kill the distance. bob
thanks for your reply bob but i dont understand diy? its not my land its where i work at? i cant run a antenna off bldg1 connected to the router and put a bigger wireless card in the computer in bldg2...or some type of reciever to catch the wireless signal and get it to work?? or should i look a wireless broadband? thanks again ehunt32
it's a common acronym. try google when you find a new term as to the antenna, you can try it but at that distance it's far over what wifi gear off the consumer lines offer. must it work? bob
external antenna, then range extender at the wireless location furthest from the signal. gets a little pricey but if no major impediments good chance.
