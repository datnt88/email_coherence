i recently bought a wd 250gb my book external hdd and it doesnt come with any software which allows me to mirror my files to it. is there any sowtware that you can download that allows you to mirror your whole hdd including the programs.
but i've tossed that out in favor of syncback. the os and programs i can reinstall but i care more about my files than any os. bob
some folks don't like it, but it works.  note that it can be run on schedule you can set it and forget it.
people losing they files with that out of date software. i'm going to give it a failing grade and write &quot;we should never speak of this again.&quot; bob
what's that six years? just because some folks have problems with their camry doesn't make toyota a bad brand.
it has not seen an update in that many years... we can do better. bob
with bob. and besides, v12stuart said he wanted to mirror (clone? image?) his disk. this is not in the purview of windows backup -- it is a job for norton ghost or acronis true image (my preference). frank
ive found a program called power quest drive image which seems to be really good because you can copy everything including programs over to another drive.
