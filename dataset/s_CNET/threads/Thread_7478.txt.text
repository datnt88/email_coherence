my computer randomly restarts while im working. any ideas on the problem? any ideas are welcome
i wonder if you could tell a bit more about this computer. or is this a machine i can pick out from the lineup i have in my garage? bob
it has a core 2 duo, nvidia 7600 gt xfx,asus motherboard, patriot ram 1gb, xion case. everything that is in my &quot;have it&quot; list random restarts, it sucks
i can't check if you picked out a nice power supply and more. since it's new, give the maker a call to have it fixed. i wish the user profiles were working but they don't all the time so try to put details in your posts. bob
i have an antec 550w power supply. refer to the other post for the other system specs. i try to send you the error message too. something about drivers if that helps at all
how many driver hunts i've been on in the last month. bob
i had this problem when i built my last computer. i would check the voltage ratings for your ram. you may need to increase the voltage in the bios. it did the trick for me. just make sure you are following the ram specs and increase it slowly. hope this helps.
