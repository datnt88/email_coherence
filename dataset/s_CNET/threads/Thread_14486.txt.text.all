<s> hey guys, i'm looking into possibly upgrading a few components of my pc, but i'm a bit out of the loop regarding current compatibilities between some of my hardware/software.  </s>
<s> i really need to upgrade my ram, but its the area giving me the most trouble.  </s>
<s> i'm currently running a evga, nforce 680i sli 775 t1, lga775, nforce 680i sli, 1333mhz fsb, ddr2-1200 8gb /4, pcie x16 sli /2, sata 3gb/s raid 0+1 /6, hda, gblan /2, fw, atx motherboard, with windows xp home, and i'm unsure as to what the best ram choice would be that is compatible with this.  </s>
<s> i know i have a 4g limit at ddr2-1200 speed, but if anyone had some suggestions please let me know.  </s>
<s> i'm also running a geforce 8800 gts 320 mb ram, that i am thinking about upgrading or maybe running two with sli, what do you guys think would be the better option?  </s>
<s> thanks a lot everyone.  </s>
<s> or is that your mb's capacity?  </s>
<s> if you're running xp home, your limit will be around 3.5 gb and any more will either be ignored or will cause trouble.  </s>
<s> what i'd do is head to crucial memory and input your motherboard make &amp; model number.  </s>
<s> it's doubtful you'll notice any improvement above 2 gb but don't get more than 4 gb.  </s>
<s> the 8800's were nice in their day.  </s>
<s> time to look at &quot;the list.&quot;  </s>
<s> link -&gt;  </s>
<s> the motherboard can support 8 gigs, but since i'm running windows xp home 32 bit it maxes at 4 gb.  </s>
<s> i just don't know what kind of ddr2-1200 ram to get.  </s>
<s> getting any so-called hot ram isn't really going to help even if you're a gamer.  </s>
<s> it will still operate at 1200 mode.  </s>
<s> though, the heat tolerate or those offered with &quot;heatsinks, etc.&quot; will be better to get, if gaming or demanding situations isn't your bag then typical high grade ram will suffice.  </s>
<s> if that's the reason for your query, then look for the various ram offering that suggest they're capable.  </s>
<s> most ram vendors, offer some tier-level of ram tolerances, etc., suggesting they do better than the entry level as in &quot;cheaper&quot; or bargain type.  </s>
<s> common sense will dictate to you what to get or desire.  </s>
<s> if getting a whole kit or re-install of ram, then be sure they match or come similar to what you have for best install.  </s>
<s> if you like to consider upgrading the os to win7 at 64-bit, you'll may like the added ram and new win7 as it seems your present pc supports it.  </s>
<s> though, you can use the win7 adviser from ms to test that, just a thought.  </s>
<s> alas, as a parting thought as well, have you checked the bios updates.  </s>
<s> it *may* provide for better ram handling abilities if so directed.  </s>
<s> not increase ram but how it handles ram or your mtrbd.  </s>
<s> per se.  </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; tada -----willy &lt;/div&gt;  </s>
