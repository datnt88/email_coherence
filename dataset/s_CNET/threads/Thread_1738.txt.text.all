<s> there are broadband phones, voip (voice over ip), vpn (virtual private network) and services that allow you to use your standard cordless or corded analog phone w/out tie-in to your pc. if you can use a standard household phone and want to go one of the least expensive routes try this vonage starter kit at the box plugs into your router, then plug your cordless phone into the box and you're in business.  </s>
