<s> i need a reliable internet capable machine that can be used easily to send ecards from a selection of ecards available on the machine.  </s>
<s> i think wireless will be better, but no other functions are required.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> the asus eee-pc weighs 3.17 pounds and &quot;up to 7 hours&quot; battery life.  </s>
<s> i'd start with that if you want a netbook.  </s>
<s> bear in mind that netbooks have no dvd/cd drives, so you might want to invest around $30 for an external ones.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> since windows isn't that reliable i think you mean the pc. at the office we have about half a dozen netbooks and all have been reliable.  </s>
<s> the last one was from walmart and they work too.  </s>
<s> about the ecards on the machine.  </s>
<s> not one laptop/netboook comes with ecards so you would install some email app.  </s>
<s> let's hope you are not thinking about incrediamail since that's not reliable.  </s>
