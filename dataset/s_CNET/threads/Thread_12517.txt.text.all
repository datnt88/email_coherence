<s> hi there, i'm writing from home about my computer at work so i don't have detailed specs.  </s>
<s> i just got a new dell (insert specs here) and i'm trying to connect my older hp psc.  </s>
<s> (insert spec here) new machine has no parallel port, printer has no usb thingie. is there any kind of adapter available?  </s>
<s> can't seems to find one online.  </s>
<s> also need a network interface card for dsl (cable is impossible in the old factory where my restaurant is located) usb to ps/2 cables (or the other way around) to connect new cpu to our 10 year old pos so i can use one mouse and keyboard on both machines.  </s>
<s> silly me, i thought i could replace our worn out computer with a spiffy new one and life would be good.  </s>
<s> silly me for not checking out this stuff before i clicked &quot;buy me!!!!&quot; arrgh.  </s>
<s> thanks, kim  </s>
<s> you need to state (your specs here).  </s>
<s> no one can help if left so wide open to at least best guesses.  </s>
<s> check this website or similar for &quot;adapters&quot;. but beware if you need this many adapters just return the system for a more usable one that already provides this otherwise, time and cost may defeat the whole purpose of the solution of replacement, while you can. a qucik fix for no parallel(lpt) port is to install a pci type card offering lpt port(s). the same solution for any dsl link, which maybe best using an ethernet port, if possible one offering m/f ports like lpt, ethernet, and serial.  </s>
<s> dsl can work using usb port just be sure that is offered as an link, but this is slow compared to ethernet.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i have an old hp printer 812c and it works fine with xp that is what it has to be compatible with.  </s>
<s> i could not use the instalation cd, i used the drivers that xp gave me.  </s>
<s> my hp computer works just as good with windows xp as it did with windows me.  </s>
<s> good luck wendell h  </s>
