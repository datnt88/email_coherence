i recently had to replace my computer running xp to a new one with vista. i am using an hp photosmart 2610 printer. when using xp i had the option of printing both sides manually, i do not have this option with vista. has anyone else had this problem?
do you have driver version 080.001.237.000 from  ?
yes i have downloaded that software & drivers but still do not gat the option to manually print on both sides dave
in word i can print the odd pages then re-insert the sheets and then the even sheets. -&gt; yes, you have to ask hp if they dropped double sided printing. they have done so many times before. or there is another reason like office 97 on vista. bob
i have the hp photosmart 8250 and have the that problem since day one with vista, so it's not just your model. after many calls to hp i was told they have no plans on fixing the problem. my neighbor bought a new hp computer and printer and it wouldn't print two sided, so it appears that hp has totally dropped double sided printing just as bob said. wayne
thanks to all of you for your reply's, guess that when i go shopping for a new printer it will not be an hp. dave
my cousin just bought a kodak all in one, i don't know the model number. it prints two sided documents using vista without any problems at all. that will be my next printer, enough of hp. wayne
