<s> i purchased a western digital esata external drive and hooked it up to my macbook pro using a siig esata-to-express34 controller.  </s>
<s> i formatted the drive using disk utility.  </s>
<s> i find that i can read from the drive fine.  </s>
<s> but whenever i try to save any large files into the drive, it stops copying after a while. the drive has a usb interface as well, and i can read/write from the drive just fine using the usb.  </s>
<s> but writes fail whenever i use the e-sata interface.  </s>
<s> what can be the problem?  </s>
<s> while i would have opted for a firewire interface on a mac any day of the week, esata while promising is still on a shake down cruise.  </s>
<s> you didn't do anything wrong.  </s>
<s> ask for your money back since i take it they didn't offer any support.  </s>

<s> i know it's a new technology, but it's catching up fast.  </s>
<s> now, i don't think it's a problem with the hard drive since i've tested two external e-sata drives and both show the same problem.  </s>
<s> someone out there must have faced the same problem.  </s>
<s> they'll either have a new driver, firmware or admit to the issue.  </s>
<s> while these forums are good this one is still a new thing that isn't working out of the box for everyone.  </s>
<s> the only way to fix this is to return defective stuff.  </s>
