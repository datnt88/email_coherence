<s> i've got a slave drive that was working fine and now wants new formatting. is there any way to fix the file system without formatting it so i can possibly save the data i had on it?  </s>
<s> i'm running windows 2000 pro with service pack 4. the drive is not the system drive for the computer.  </s>
<s> you posted in a hardware forum, but it looks like a software or format issue.  </s>

<s> how important is your data, you could send the drive to a data recovery service (like ontrack) to get the data back.  </s>
<s> when a drive all of a sudden needs formatting again there is usually something wrong with it, physically.  </s>
<s> what actually happened that led up to this, what told you it needed formatting, exactly what did you see?  </s>
