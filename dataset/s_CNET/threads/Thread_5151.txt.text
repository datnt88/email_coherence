most games to today require a processor speed from 2.5 to 3.0 ghz. and lucky me i have my amd 64 3500 is 2.2 ghz, so im looking to upgrade my processor. the only thing is i dont have alot of money, i need to find a good processor between 2.8 to 3.0 ghz. that were yall come in if yall can help my i would appreciate it. right now i have a emachin t6542 and my motherboard socket is am2. if any could help my i would appreciate it. by the way i was looking at these 2 proccessors on newegg is this good or bad.
the video card and the amount of ram is at least as important (or even more important) as the cpu-speed. it could well be that the best way to spend a fixed amount of money isn't for a cpu but for a graphic card or extra ram. can you tell: - your current video card - your current amount of ram - two recent games you want to play on this machine just to be sure you do the best available thing. kees
requiring a 3.0 ghz processor? you may be surprised that your processor might handle them as that 3500 in the processor name means that it has the equivalent of a 3.5 ghz pentium 4 speed i believe. regards, jb (who is quite happy with his 2.6 ghz dual-core processor)
my graphics card is a nvidia geforce 7300 gs 256mb and i have 1gig and 512mb of ddr2 ram.
the two games i want to play are hellgate london and tabula rasa
