i'm planning to sell my pc but i don't know what to ask for it. any suggestions anyone. technical specifications: compaq presario sr1603wm pc - microsoft windows xp media center edition 2005 - amd athlon 64 3500+ (2200mhz/512kb/2000mhz/x86-x64) - 512mb pc3200 ddr400 ram - 120gb hdd (7200rpm/8mb/udma/e-ide) - 48x32x48x16x dvd-rw dual layer (dvd burner) - 9-in-1 digital media card reader - ati radeon xpress 200 igp (256mb/400mhz/dx9/pci-x) - realtek alc658 6-channel audio codec - realtek rtl8139 10/100mbps integrated lan - conexant 56k data/fax modem - compaq 17&quot; flat-screen crt monitor - compaq quietkey & 3-button compaq scroller mouse - logitech cordless desktop wireless keyboard & mouse + 4aa batteries - creative sbs340 2.1 speaker system - lexmark x1185 all-in-one - extra cpu included - amd sempron 64 3200+ (1800mhz/256kb/1600mhz) - original oem recovery disk - front led changed from green to the hp standard blue light - and much more! what do you guys think? i can't but a price on it. can you guys tell me a reasonable price for it. *the reason i'm selling it is because i bough an hp laptop and i have it connected to the expansion bay and well i can use it as a desktop. so i prefer to have one computer instead of two computers.
this acer aspire is pretty close to your config and costs $370 new:  since your pc is used, cut that price in half ($185). add $40 for the monitor, $25 for printer (see ebay pricing), and $20 for speakers and keyboard/mouse.
that's what i insured one like that i sent to my nephew. since there is no warranty or support the price takes a heavy hit. see what they are going for on ebay. bob
unless i needed the money. i'm curious about this statement tho. and i have it connected to the expansion bay and well i can use it as a desktop?
i have it connected to an hp expansion bay and have my notebook setup as a desktop:p
ok well from what i think is a reasonable price would be about 300-400$ has good stuff inculded i agree with someother people you should keep it for future stuff...... anyways that is a pretty good machine!
i was thinking of that price. but if i buy the amd athlon 64 x2 cpu i said i want and a compaq 19&quot; widescreen lcd display then i won't sell it. lol! but yeah who knows.
