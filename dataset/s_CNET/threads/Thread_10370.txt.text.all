<s> i have a old pentium 4 computer custom built back in 2001.  </s>
<s> foll are the details: pentium 4 cpu 1400 mhz 256 mb rdram nvidia geforce2 32mb while i am not a computer guy, i am comfortable swapping out parts to make it faster(coming to think of it...i think i did swap out the orig graphics card sometime in 2005 or so).  </s>
<s> question is if it is worthwhile to make it last another 2-3 years by swapping out new components or should i just get a new computer.  </s>
<s> specifically: - what is the fastest cpu i can upgrade to using the same board.  </s>
<s> (the one inside is a willamette 0.18um technology acc to speccy) - what type of memory can i use.  </s>
<s> i saw a post here saying ddr ram(whcih seem to have won out the battle) is not compatible with rdram.  </s>
<s> can i swap out all the rd rams to some other platform without changing the board... sorry for the long winded query but appreciate any expert advice.  </s>
<s> happy holidays to all.  </s>
<s> the cpu is governed by 2 things. the motherboard and the availability of a cpu.  </s>
<s> since it's been many years the problem is that many searched and used up what would have been the faster cpus.  </s>
<s> we can't start looking for a cpu since you didn't supply what dell computer this was or if something else, the make, model or details.  </s>
<s> even if we had that the speed bump would be minimal and frankly i've seen faster machines from freecycle or the free area of craigslist for free.  </s>
<s> i would not upgrade this box.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i was suspecting that much but wanted to get confirmation.  </s>
<s> i do see some used components being sold online but figured that would put be back the cost of getting a cheap new one.  </s>
<s> also, the computer was built for me by a local store.  </s>
<s> it has a bunch of retail parts.  </s>
<s> so cant give you more details than in my orig post till i can open it.  </s>
<s> i think i will start looking for new year sales for new computers.  </s>
<s> thanks again for your input.  </s>
<s> then the make, model and revision of the mainboard is needed.  </s>
<s> here's why.  </s>
<s> there were socket 423 and 478 rdram boards.  </s>
<s> and then some boards didn't supply ht p4 cpus.  </s>
<s> for now you could limit your search for non-ht cpus of the 423 or 478 p4 with the same fsb.  </s>
<s> sorry but i'll stick to the acronyms and you can google what they mean today.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> pcwizard2010 or belarc and they will tell you most everything you need to know about your pc components.  </s>
<s> if you have a system requiring rdram, your best bet is to skip all this an head for an up-to-date pc. vapcmd  </s>
