the situation: i need to print to 640 printers on a single network. i need to add these printers to my computer, and then print to them. the printing should be as simultaneous as possible. doing this by hand would obviously take forever, so i am open to third party apps (cheap), vbscripts (with instruction please), command prompts, or anything else that will work. i've found programs to facilitate the &quot;printing&quot; part, i really am looking for suggestions on the &quot;adding&quot;. all of the printers are tcp/ip. any suggestions are greatly appreciated. thanks! you may be saving a small business!
(ws.10).aspx is where i would start as a programmer. do you have a programmer on your staff?
nope, i'm practically alone. i have a part time assistant, and there are the ladies in the media center that boot the computers for me in the morning. can you say budget cuts? other options?
intelliscribe might be what you're looking for. not exactly cheap, but for a small business it might be worth looking into.  you could also try doing a search for &quot;broadcast printing&quot; for possible hits.
intelliscribe is fine for distribution, but its adding the printers to my machine that i'm hung up on. thanks though
go with what you have. when faced with such limits and no staff i find the best course of action is to use what you know and have. i do know there are command line methods but these will only confuse most as not only it's the command line but the setup will be taxing. bob
