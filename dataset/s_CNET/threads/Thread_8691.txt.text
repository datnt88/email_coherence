i use nero6, the prog goes thru the hoops but when its time to begin the burn it ejects the blank dvd,this is for data as well as video. i have tried other dvd authoring software on my pc but they all do the same thing.it burns cds just fine. i have a hp media center pc m7357. 920 intel processor dual core, 1.5g ram, 300 gb hard drive and plenty of space. i've tried a system recovery with no success. everything else works just fine. i have looked at numerous questions on the cnet but as usual every case is different. any suggestions would be helpful.
i uninstall nero then i try some simpler software (it's free) such as cdburnerxp. bob
some of dvd burners are sensitive to their place on a bus - master or slave device. check the user manual or try both alternatives.
i had a similar problem with my hp media center pc (essentially the same model). i tried using nero7 and other software as well, and none of them liked the hp dvds that i was using. then, i tried some of the mitsui dvd-rs that i had on hand. those worked fine. so, it may just not like your media.
i tried all the suggestions. none helped though, but i appreciate the very quick response to my dilemma. i then contacted hp tech support and after an hour and a half of trying their thoughts they concluded that my driver was fried and believe it or not they shipped me a new drive the next day. i hope i can help you someday. thanks again.
