if softwares such as 'premier' and 'hollywood fx' are used for editing of video clips, are graphic cards such as 'pinnacle tara 3000' or 'pinnacle pro-one rtdv se' necessary? 
why? 
thank you 
. 
hi lashkari the graphic cards ,according to some experts,give better results and qiuck results. 
by better results i mean that when converting from &quot;avi&quot; format to &quot;dat&quot; format(vcd)the resulting color and sharpness are much better.
