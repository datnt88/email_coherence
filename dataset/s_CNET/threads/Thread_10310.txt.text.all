<s> so i've built a heavy hardware near top of the line computer.  </s>
<s> its got intel core 2 duo with stock fan 2gb ram 320gb hd dvd-r drive stock power supply it won't stay on for more than like 1 or 2 minutes after i hit the power button.  </s>
<s> my theory is either its overheating because the cpu fan was sort of hard to click in and seemed loose.  </s>
<s> or the fan just sucks.  </s>
<s> i only have one other fan besides the stock one and i have a zalman system cooling fan on hand that is extremely big and probably would keep the whole system layered with frost.  </s>
<s> anyone have any other ideas?  </s>
<s> a new heat sink and fan, and use lots of thermal goop.  </s>
<s> at all and you'll need some thermaol grease.  </s>
<s> something's definitely wrong here.  </s>
<s> if that fails to solve the problem and you're sure the hs fan is properly installed ... here's an efficient but modestly priced cpu cooling option.  </s>
