i've been looking around for a good wireless headset (incl microphone) to use with my computer for playing games. my computer is about 15ft away from me, so the extension cable for my current headset is quite annoying. however, the only over-the-ear wireless offerings that i can find are just headphones, with no mic. the only bluetooth headsets that i can find are for cell phones and are usually the small in-ear type with lower audio quality. i have an x-fi audio card and i'd be putting it to waste with those tinny in ear cell phone headsets. what i want is a quality wireless headset (pref over the ear) that i can watch movies/play games with mostly, but has a microphone for when i need it. does anyone know of any product out there that is like this?
the bluetooth route is the way to go. i have southwing. they sound extremely good & have a mic. they are the around the neck type, very comfortable, & rechargeable.
may be this can serve your purpose  imho, usd 100 is a rip off.
i am an online elementary teacher and i wear a headset (all7 hours) that is attached to my school's pc at home. your suggestion will make my life easier. i use skype for my lessons with elluminate live. my house vonage/panasonic machine is 2.4 will this cause interference?
