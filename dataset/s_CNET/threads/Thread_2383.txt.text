hi there i am running the follow; amd xp2400+ 300watt psu 512mb windows me. after having monitor freeze ups, i download some software called everest home edition. it reports my graphic card as oper ating at around 68(*c)154(*f) is this normal and is this program accurate? the graphics card is a geforce2 mx 400 any help apreciated!
that's too small. i don't debate such lockups since i expect from such power supplies. i change up to 450watts and then start looking if it still locks up. for now, unplug a spare drive and leave the cover off. bob
done listen to that 450 watt jibber-jabber. 300 watts is fine. also, your video card would be fried if it were at 150 degrees farenheit. that gauge thingy is way off. just install another fan if needed
i would get away from windows me and any mx version of geforce. ok ok maybe you would be ok with the mx but get rid of me. too many problems with it.
cpu overheating will cause problems as well
i had the same problem with the video card overheating. replaced the video card and installed a extra fan. took care of the problem.
