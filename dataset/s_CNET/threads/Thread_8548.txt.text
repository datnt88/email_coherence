i don't have wireless at my office but i want to be able to use the internet on my ipod touch. is there a usb stick or something i can buy to create a small network from my desktop?
a wifi router costs as much and doesn't have me setting up a bizarre solution. i suggest you look again for a wifi router. bob
it's a work computer so i would want something that is easy to plug in and out. that way i can plug it in when i get there and unplug it when i leave everyday.
for that we leave that to the it staffers. the setup of the usual wifi dongle would have us need (in most cases) the os setup cd as we would make fairly big changes to the networking. just so you know that it's non-trivial so let your it staff do that one. bob
to do this without involving the it guys? i was hoping to keep this on the down low. if the company wanted to have wifi then there would be wifi. there's no gadget that i can just plug in and create a network off of?
i have yet to see anything such as an usb wifi adapter that would work without drivers and a somewhat involved network configuration. and as you said, it may be that they forbid wifi. if so why put your job at risk over this? bob
