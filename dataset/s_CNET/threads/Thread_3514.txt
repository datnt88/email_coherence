15088	20	134052	1512698	1512565	linkit	11/2/05 3:22 pm	1.13094492e12	not necessarily	'' so can i assume that this means any standard atx board will fit into my case?'' not necessarily. look on p.12 of the technical information pdf. section ''1.1 overview'' says the motherboard was made in microatx (9.6'' x 9.6'') and full atx (12.0'' x 9.6'') sizes. which one do you have? you could put a microatx board in a number of standard case sizes, but you can't put a full atx board in the smaller atx cases. if you are going to get a new motherboard that can accommodate a more recent cpu (p4, athlon 64, dual cores), the other components will have to be of a more recent generation as well. this includes the power supply unit (psu). new components probably will need a new case to ensure proper cooling, fit larger fans, accommodate larger heatsinks, et al. there are good deals on new cases that come with psu's.

15088	23	134052	1512937	1512698	kingrvrs	11/2/05 5:34 pm	1.13095284e12	mobo size	yes i did see that part. my board appears to be a micro. (9.6&quot; x 9.6&quot;) but my case has 3&quot; vertical clearance from bottom of mobo to bottom of case and extra set of connectors to accomadate (i assume) the larger board with more pci slots. my case has 2 pci slot openings in it that cannot be utilized with existing board due to its size. if i can't get a p4 (no biggie) can i get a p3 (or older athlon,not really up to snuff on their products)around 800mhz and still utilize existing peripherals, i.e. dvd rom and floppy. (also psu)i'm only trying to get as much as i can without building or buying all new computer. if it will only be a 600mhz processor i can get that probably won't be worth the effort and i would probably just build a newer computer (first time) to save $.
15088	24	134052	1513099	1512937	linkit	11/2/05 6:49 pm	1.13095734e12	new build sounds wise	according to the specifications of the upgraded bios on your current mobo, you should be able to upgrade to this slot1 piii 600mhz processor; however i give no guarantees. for the price, it may be worth the tinkering.  problem is that you will still be limited with the 600mhz piii. a lot of today's hardware and software needs a faster processor or one with a specific instruction set. i think you are right--probably the only case items you could bring to the new build are the dvd and floppy drives.
