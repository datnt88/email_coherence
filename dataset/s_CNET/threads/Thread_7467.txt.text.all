<s> so i recently bought parts to build a new computer to replace my old one, and i bought a spire swordfin sp-9007b from newegg.com where as after i recived it i noticed that the case doesn't seem to have any normal slots for hard drives that i can see. the place in the case where it looks like it's meant to go &quot;underneath the floppy and cd drives&quot; there are two metal walls with lots of big oval shaped holes, but no places for screws to fit and the open sides face both the case doors. the case didn't include any manuals or instructions and the people on the spire website refuse to even respond to my emails.  </s>
<s> if anyone can shed some light on my problem i would be very thankful.  </s>
<s> does it look like this?  </s>
<s> yikes, that's pretty different from the inside of my case which has everything except the hard drive bays.  </s>
<s> thanks for the help.  </s>
<s> ugh i don't think spire is going to pay for the shipping on their own mistake.  </s>
