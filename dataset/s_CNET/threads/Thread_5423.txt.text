i have a scanner and a printer that i want to connect at the same time, but they don't seem to want to work at the same time. if i connect my scanner, the printed wont' work. i also can't get an embroidery digitizing program to recognize the scanner.
you didn't tell much, but let me share that parallel port scanners are fairly doa for support since they were problems even back then. you get to dig out the trouble guide and try it all again. bob
oops... guess that would help. hp scanjet 4670 and canon i960 photo color printer. both are connected buy usb cables to the cpu.
i would uninstall the scanner and printer, then add back the scanner, shut down, reboot, then add the printer......shut down and reboot. then try scanning something simple, like text, to see if you are getting a printing connection. i always try to stick to one mfg if i have 2 separate devices....just for the reason of compatibility.
