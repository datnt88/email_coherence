<s> recently i moved into my new student appartment and the only internet that was available was wireless.  </s>
<s> i have a wireless bt hub at the only port in the house and then a linksys router by my pc. by flashing the linksys router i was able to turn it into a receiver and so it goes straight into my network port in the back of my pc. out of 100 pings to the router from my pc i get about 6-10 which are in the range of 70-130ms.  </s>
<s> the rest are either 1ms (mass majority) and 2ms.  </s>
<s> this is causing me problems ingame as i get about 3-6 ping spikes a minute which interupts my play.  </s>
<s> anyone who can help?  </s>
<s> i'm using wep encrpytion, and the linksys model is a wrt54gl.  </s>
<s> sorry but no need to write again that wep is dead and with a kiddie script you can be smacked down.  </s>
<s> move the security up one notch to wpa and read this forum's sticky.  </s>
<s> again, i must be harsh on this.  </s>
<s> i will not discuss wep as it is dead.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> that's a bit annoying really as i tried wpa and the latency was horrible (60-180ms) between the router and receiver... wep seemed the fastest.  </s>
<s> despite the poor security.  </s>
<s> however i always use our forum sticky settings.  </s>
<s> tell if you did something other than the forum sticky settings.  </s>
<s> again, wep is not a solution as the kiddie tools swat the connection down and more.  </s>
<s> but that's been covered enough times.  </s>
