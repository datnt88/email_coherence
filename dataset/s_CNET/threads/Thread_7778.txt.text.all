<s> rick, thanks for your reply, i just finished updating windows (i choose every optional installation) and after a second restart i got the pop up again.  </s>
<s> also downloaded the hp software from hp web page and installed an uninstalled the software since the pop up appears even without the printer being connected, i believe the problem should be a piece of software that kind of &quot;identifies new hardware&quot; when there is none, as part of the process to install the printer when is part of the wireless network.  </s>
