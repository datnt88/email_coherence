<s> i have the sims hot date cd but i lost the code so does anybody know where i can get a new code?  </s>
<s> please help!!!  </s>
<s> why not go to their website and click on the help link to contact their tech support fora new code?  </s>
<s> you mean you lost the cd case for the expansion pack?  </s>
<s> that's where the code is.  </s>
<s> each one is different.  </s>
<s> if you really lost it, you will have to uninstall your game and buy a new version of hot date so you have a new password.  </s>
<s> weather you bought the cd on line or in the store, i'm sure their web page help will gladly help you out.  </s>
<s> i've bought things on line and lost or misplaced my code or password.  </s>
<s> if they have your name on file they will give you a code or new password...buying on line helps you because they send you an e-mail, usually with your user name and password, so any time you have to re-install they will send you to a site to re-install....good luck  </s>
<s> the reason is in the forum polices... bob  </s>
