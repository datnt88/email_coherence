hi, this started last night. i wanted to copy some files to a cd, but the program told me i had none. after checking my computer, i saw that my drive was not listed under &quot;my computer&quot;, and it was not working. it is listed in the device manager with an exclamation beside it. in the properties for the drive, it said the drivers were either missing or corrupt. i have tried installing them, but it says the ones i have are the most recent. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling. no change. i checked my bios, but saw nothing unusual there. the drive is listed. when i put a cd in, the light starts flashing, and it does sound like it is turning. but i cannot access anything on it. what could i try next? or is the drive damaged? take care! chris hp pavilion 061 amd athlon processor 2100 mghz 63 gb hd cd reader/writer, dvd reader (same drive) windows xp sp2
check device manager&gt;properties&gt;resources&gt; change memory resources to an empty one.
sorry, but i can't find any &quot;resource&quot; in my device manager-properties. chris
i'm guessing that this pc is a couple of years old. you dvd has died it's time for a new one. a new dvd burner is $50 at newegg.com john
thanks for replying. i'd be really mad if it's burned out. this is on a completely new computer that i got at christmas. like i said, the drive still spins and stuff. it just seems the computer won't recognize it. well, at worst, it's still under guarantee! take care. chris
if this was my machine, i'd delete the upperfilters and lowerfilters registry keys. i can't find the exact article you may need (some use roxio, some don't) but the procedure is the same regardless of the software cause. read
call hp and get them involved. that's what a warranty is for.
that did the trick. now i know why it happened in the first place too. chris
this is a common issue which i've witnessed people reload the os, buy hardware and more. as a favor to the forum, when you see this issue, share your experience. bob
