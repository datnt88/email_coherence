hey, i know this has probably been covered before but i couldn't find one that matched my situation. ok so i bought a sata hd as a backup dive, and at first xp recognized it. but i got an error half way though formatting the sata and since then xp will not recognized it.and don't say disk management because that the typical solution i keep finding except for the fact that it doesn't show in disk management. any idea's people ?? system is - amd athlon 3200+ 64 bit , msi rs482m4 mother board, 1.5 gigs of ram , with a ide main hd and the sata is a wd caviar black
try that; if not then maybe go to wd website and download some. good luck.
i guess you didn't read the part that the hd doesn't show in disk management. it shows in the bios , not in windows . and i've tried all of the software to download from wd and still nothing
it may be worth deleting your sata controller driver from device manager. after removing it, and rebooting, the system will automatically reinstall, and redetect devices attached. if it still fails, preform the same again, with the sata drive detached, and after it's reinstalled, then attach the sata drive.
