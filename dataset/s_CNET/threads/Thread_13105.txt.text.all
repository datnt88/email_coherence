<s> i went to turn on my computer the other day and when it was booting nothing came on my screen....i immediately thought it was a graphics card issue.  </s>
<s> when i looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything.  </s>
<s> i have an 1.1 gig athlon...any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>

<s> typically you strip it down to motherboard, cpu/hsf, power supply and a speaker and hope that it beeps.  </s>

<s> a flashing power button usually means the system is in standby mode.  </s>
<s> holding the power button in until it shuts off, then powering back up will usually fix this.  </s>
