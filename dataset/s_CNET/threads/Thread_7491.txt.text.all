<s> right now i have two sticks of ddr3 1333 4gb.  </s>
<s> i am thinking of getting two more sticks of ddr3 1600 4gb.  </s>
<s> what i want to know is if i mix the two ram speeds will my computer use both speeds equally, use the faster speed ram first, or will it underclock the faster sticks to match the slower ones?  </s>
<s> the bus speed drops to the lowest speed on the cpu bus.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> does that mean that the ddr3 1600 underclocks to ddr1333?  </s>
<s> im not on the geek squad..yet,but from wat i've seen,it defaults to the lowest mhz....yes.  </s>
<s> so would it be faster to have just the 8gb of 1600 or 16gb of 1333?  </s>
<s> if i were to guess that games or photoshop then the 8gb wins.  </s>
<s> if i were to guess some database in 16gb ram then the 16gb wins. the winner depends on the question.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> file sizes you're running.  </s>
<s> if the file sizes are small... the ram over 4gb may never get used.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> i would go with the 16gb's...definitely.  </s>
<s> your doubling your memory,and only losing 1267mhz...i wouldn't think twice dmobbjr.  </s>
<s> ...but then again,i'm the guy who posted &quot;can i run two power supplies?&quot;.lol  </s>
<s> i can't subtract apparently...your losing 267mhz.  </s>
<s> my advice doesn't exactly instill confidence.lol  </s>
<s> i am using this compute for gaming so it sounds like i should go with 8gb  </s>
