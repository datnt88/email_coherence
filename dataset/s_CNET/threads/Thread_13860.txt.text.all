<s> just go done building a new computer and i go to hook my computer up to my tv like i always do so i can watch movies and i hook it up to the dvi port on my 9800 gt and attach the dvi to hdmi adapter on to the dvi port and plug it up to my tv through my hdmi cord and it looks like ****! its all off the screen like its bigger than the tv screen its self so i change some settings and just cant get it to work.so can anybody help here's what i know my tv - &lt;a href=&quot; &gt;link&lt;/a&gt; my tv's max resolution - 1366x768 also when i hook up my computer to my tv via dvi to vga adapter it fits the screen.  </s>
<s> p.s. i know that its not going to look as good on the tv due to the pixel depth but thats not my problem its just that its off the screen,just said that to not cause confusion.  </s>
<s> anything elese you need to know just ask.  </s>
<s> here's the link to my tv -  </s>
<s> if the hdcp can't be verified (sorry, i hope you will google what new terms are as i won't duplicate that here) then the display should fall back to sdtv resolution or &quot;480p.&quot; the fix is to connect with vga and forget hdmi.  </s>
<s> you could get a video card with hdmi output that is certified to output hdcp compliante hdmi but my bet is that would run a bit more cash and involve the vista os. bob  </s>
