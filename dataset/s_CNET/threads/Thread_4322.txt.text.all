<s> hi, in my home we have an imac g5, two laptops running windows xp, and one desktop, also xp. we have an o2 wireless box iv (which i believe is a rebadged thomson speedtouch tg587nv2) to which the mac and desktop pc are wired and the two laptops connect wirelessly.  </s>
<s> one of the laptops is mine, and i would like to be able to connect to the mac to share files etc, and possibly to the other pcs, but this is not imperative.  </s>
<s> i have a printer connected to the mac, and one to the pc, which i would like to be able to access from any of the laptops.  </s>
<s> i haven't got a clue how to start setting this up!  </s>
<s> could anyone offer advice please?  </s>
<s> can i use the wireless router as a print server?  </s>
<s> what are the security implications of having all the computers networked i.e if a virus infected one, could it spread through the network?  </s>
<s> most of the people in my house are even more clueless than me, i wouldn't want one of them clicking on an email attachment and infecting everyone!  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help and advice.  </s>
<s> why not get a wireless (wifi) printer since any printer server will cost just as much.  </s>
<s> also, the setup is not the only thing you would learn but when another machine won't print you dive into another deeper pool of issues that you don't seem ready for.  </s>
<s> there is no single paragraph i could write to begin to cover it all (unless i wrote to google it?) so the simplest solution is to get a wifi printer and then let them print to it.  </s>
<s> as to sharing files.  </s>
<s> i can start by using dropbox (see google).  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> get a wireless printer for about $100.  </s>
<s> load the software on each laptop and desktop, make it the default printer on each michine and save a lot of time and trouble.  </s>
