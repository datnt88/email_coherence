i have one ethernet cable coming into a room but i have a pc and and xbox 360 that i need to get online. does anyone make a splitter to divide the one cable? is it even possible? running another cable from the router can't be done, no room left. thanks
since the cable comes from a router, a simple switched hub should be fine. i know there is a splitter but that's not what you want. bob
i got a d-link, plugged it in and both were online. thanks, you make me look good have a happy new year!!!
