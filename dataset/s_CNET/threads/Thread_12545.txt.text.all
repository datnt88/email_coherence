<s> my dog chewed threw the cable to my wireless adapter for my keyboard and mouse. is there a way replace the adapter so that i can keep using the same keyboard and mouse?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> without make, model and such i can't guess this one.  </s>
<s> unlikely you will get the just the adapter but they may be sold.  </s>
<s> if it is just the cable and not the unit on the end of the cable you should be able to buy any cheap usb cable and splice it. the wire colors in these seem to be pretty standard so you should be able to match them up.  </s>
<s> soldered would be best but i am sure you can twist the wires together and tape them and they will work.  </s>
<s> i tried that, do you have any idea how small the actual wires are inside a usb cable?  </s>
<s> on page 13 note a smallest size of 28 gauge.  </s>
<s> now that i know the exact size of the wire, a simple google search yielded many places to get one for wire that small.  </s>
<s> now for the real interesting part, splicing them together!  </s>
<s> wish me luck, i've never sliced wires this small.  </s>
<s> pictures!  </s>
<s> i didn't do it, a guy at work did it, works just fine.  </s>
<s> thanks to all who posted - saved me some $ and a lot of aggravation!  </s>
<s> thanks for the report.  </s>
