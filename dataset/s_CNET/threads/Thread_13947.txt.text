can i have 3 computers behind a router then my web server then another router then the cable modem?
but do not ask me how to do this. that's an experts only setup and you get to do the hiwire act solo. yes, i know how, but that does you little good when you have an issue. bob
thanks bob i will give it a try when i got some extra time on my hands.
