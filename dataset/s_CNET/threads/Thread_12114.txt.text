i am having trouble connecting to my desktop pc (running windows xp sp2) from other laptop pcs on my local network. i have set up folder sharing on all the xp pcs but i am not able to &quot;see&quot; folders on the desktop pc. i try to open any folder on my xp sp3 pc from a laptop, and i get: &quot;\\jeff-amd\jeff-amd documents is not accessible. you might not have permission to use this network resource. contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. not enough server storage is available to process this command. so, i would appreciate any help you could give me to allow me to access files on the desktop pc from the client laptop. when i go the other way, i can open directories on the laptops from the desktop pc no problem. so i don't think it's a router/firewall problem. - jeff schallenberg mont saint-hilaire, qubec
1. you log on as jeff on the other machine. 2. you also can log on as jeff on the machine sharing the folder. i do so an issue that i always avoid. i never allow such an user name. take the dash out. bob
@r. proffitt: jeff-amd is the name of the desktop pc, and jeff-amd documents is the name of the share. my user name is jeff on both machines. thanks for your reply. i'm still looking for a solution to allow access to my desktop pc from my network... - jeff
firewalls. i've lost count of how many times it's this. many don't understand that norton and others continue to work in spite of us setting them to disabled. some don't have control of the firewall in the router.
