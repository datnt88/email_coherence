<s> hi! i have an old [but great] olympus digital camera.  </s>
<s> it has an 8 mg smart media card.  </s>
<s> i took about one hundred sixty pictures of my students at camp this week.  </s>
<s> i checked from time-to-time to ensure that my pictures were good.  </s>
<s> on the last day of the camping trip i noticed that my camera screen showed a giant exclamation point.  </s>
<s> i could not take anymore pictures.  </s>
<s> i could not view any of the previous pictures.  </s>
<s> when i got home from the trip i inserted the memory card into my computer reader.  </s>
<s> it wanted to format the card.  </s>
<s> i went to rite-aid to use their reader.  </s>
<s> it was not recognized the memory card.  </s>
<s> what can i do?  </s>
<s> i have thirty students whose week of memories may have disappeared.  </s>
<s> again, please help!  </s>
<s> there are many data recovery programs for cards.  </s>
<s> see if any from is able to recover those pictures.  </s>
<s> i can't recommend any from personal experience.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> as mentioned, you'll need to use recovery software.  </s>
<s> here's an article describing the software with reviews and links to freeware recovery software available on this site: now the smartmedia card was, if i'm not mistaken, the first flash card.  </s>
<s> also if i remember correctly, these cards were not really designed to be durable and last forever (few years max).  </s>
<s> i'm surprised yours was still working properly.  </s>
<s> would highly recommend considering a new camera with new media.  </s>
<s> yeah, olympus was one of my 1st digital cameras.  </s>
<s> i have had other newer digital cameras; but olympus was always my back-up.  </s>
<s> it was very dependable. the last picture for my trip is when the card &quot;went south&quot; on me.  </s>
<s> i have a nice nikon coolpix that i like; but i wasn't going to take that out into the woods with a hundred 6th graders.  </s>
<s> i took my old back-up, the olympus.  </s>
<s> in retrospect i guess that olympus was an old-timer.  </s>
<s> thank you so much for the quick response.  </s>
