i am running an ibm 300pl 450mhz piii with 256megs of ram with winxp and i am interested in the multiple monitors setup. my current graphics card is an s3 trident onboard vga. i've attempted to include the onboad output with a pci card for the setup and also 2 pci cards. each card when individually in use works fine, but when i attempt to use them in a multiple monitor setup, the computer says one is a [code 10: the device does not work.] my only explanation is that the bios wont let me have the setup cause the second card does not show up when i boot it. the bios dates to 2001. any help would be great. thanx
&quot;my current graphics card is an s3 trident onboard vga.&quot; and that's about all we know about your hardware for the video. have you tried a dual output pci card like a matrox or a pair of things that others have seen working? it's not a bios issue. bob
no, i have not tried a dual output, i've only tried a combination of pci cards and i thought this should work because i know others who have used a setup like what im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue?
&quot;i've only tried a combination of pci cards and i thought this should work because i know others who have used a setup like what im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue?&quot; yes. i did have a few dual pci card setups. all were combos like a pair of ati cards that had the needed dual display capable drivers or a pair of matrox millenium cards. been there, done that. it's all in the cards and drivers. bob
thanx, i'll work on it.
