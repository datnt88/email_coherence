i recently replaced my psu and graphics card in my computer. everything was fine until the monitor started to act strange. i would turn on my computer and i could hear it was loading windows but the monitor will not display anything. sometimes i am able to turn of the computer and then turn it back on and it works, but now it doesnt seem to want to do anything (even though i was using it fine and hour or so before). is this problem being cause by my new graphics card or psu r is it another issue? thanks for any help.
mabey you should try it with a different computer? that'd narrow it down? 'my monitor not displaying' anything isn't a question?
-output of new power supply...maybe not enough to support all your drives and the new graphics card -graphics card power connector....is there one? -cooling...does your card require a better cooling system? -monitor...if it's a flatscreen, it should have a built-in powersaving function with a 'screensaver'. if that displays correctly when disconnected from the card, but nothing shows up on your screen when plugged into the card, it could be one of two things. either the graphics card isn't sending a signal to your monitor, or it's sending a different type of signal. make sure your monitor is set to digital if you're using dvi, or analog if you're using vga.
try booting into safe mode. if it works fine in safe mode, you might want to try replacing the drivers for the card.
