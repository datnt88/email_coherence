just got cable internet installed a week ago, and now i can't use my pc labtop( my roomate's) to get on the net, but my mac is able to be online. a few days i ago i reset my router, because it had blocked my school website, but nothing else. i reset the router, and i was able to get on my school website, but i wasn't able to use my pc. my computer is attached to the modem, (don't have internal modem) the cable goes into the modem, then i have a cat 5 cable, that connects to the router, and then had another cat 5 cable connect to the pc. i don't have the any information on the router, other than its a netgear wireless router mr814v2. a friend of mine suggested i had bad cables, (wasn't a problem), type ipconfig in the cmd, but didn't do anything. please let me know if anyone has any suggestions. i have a g4 mac 10.2, 867 processor 768mem compaq presario labtop, xp homeedition, amd 4, proc 489, 496 memory
in your post, you described the pc connected to the modem, to the router and then reveal you have two routers. i can't tell what your setup is. bob
sorry to confuse you, thanks for replying to my post! my mac is connected to the modem, then connected to the router. then i a cat5 cable is connected going from the router, to the pc. i only have one router, everything is daisy chained to each other. the pc has cat5 cable that goes from the to the router to the pc's port. when i had the cable installed it was installed on my computer. all did to get the pc online was plugin a cat5 cable. i had to reset my router, and i think thats when the connection got lost on the pc. i tried a repair option in windows, is there a way i can tell is what its ip address should be?
&quot;my mac is connected to the modem, then connected to the router. then i a cat5 cable is connected going from the router,...&quot; sorry, that's some odd setup. i've never seen such a setup. i'd ask who designed it to help you make it work. bob
