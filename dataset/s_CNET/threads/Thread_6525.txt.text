since you posted in the hardware forum do you think this is a hardware issue? as to norton and can't find the download, that's a typical problem not to be ashamed of. today's browsers now toss files into some download area and we have to go looking there. if this is not a hardware issue the cnet computer help forum has fielded the old can't find a file i downloaded question quite a few times. most of the replies are to watch more carefully what we are doing. bob
