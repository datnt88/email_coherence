on june 20, 2011 donald bell of cnet wrote a piece on a combination case/bluetooth keyboard to be released in july for samsung galaxy tablet 10.1. samsung support is useless. since it does not yet appear on their website, they don't have a clue. does anyone have an update as to availability?
there are cases out there but not from samsung.  hope this helps, bob
still only place i have found it is on a uk site and it says &quot;ship when available&quot; - which can mean anything. 133 usd
i found it at expansys-usa.com. for $133.99 which is a bit less than the $149.00 list. they are showing a ship date of 9/12/11. don't know if that is right but i ordered one anyway. we'll see what happens. good luck
