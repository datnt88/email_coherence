<s> are there any netbooks out there that can be viewed in direct sunlight?  </s>
<s> almost nothing else (memory, battery life, etc.) is a concern.  </s>
<s> thoughts?  </s>
<s> while we know the toughbooks (see google) have sunlight readable displays there is no market for the netbook version.  </s>
<s> or rather will the market be big enough to support the sunlight readable toughbook and a netbook version?  </s>
<s> i'm going with no. bob  </s>
<s> well, i might defer to that touchscreen one from acer.  </s>
<s> t91 i think.  </s>
<s> thanks for your responce bob.  </s>
<s> guess i'm just spoiled from using my t400 outside.  </s>
<s> i was hoping to find something in the netbook size/pricerange.  </s>
<s> i'm assuming you're referring to glossy vs. matte displays?  </s>
<s> most netbooks and consumer laptops have glossy displays, which are next to impossible to view outdoors.  </s>
<s> there are a few netbooks that do have matte displays, however.  </s>
<s> namely the samsung nc10 and the hp mini 110.  </s>
<s> i haven't used either of them outdoors, though.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> i am looking at the reviews now and may grab one of these models soon.  </s>
<s> both have reviews stating they are &quot;suitible for outdoor use.&quot;  </s>
<s> thank you for the reply.  </s>
<s> i am not the happy owner of an hp 110-1030nr.  </s>
<s> imagine my surprise when walking through the px (military everything-type store) here in afghanistan and seeing it on display right after these posts.  </s>
<s> it came with an extended battery.  </s>
<s> i'm happy to have the extra battery life, but mixed on not being able to pack it without taking it off.  </s>
<s> but if that's the only downside, i'm sitting pretty.  </s>
<s> thanks for all of the help.  </s>
<s> chad  </s>
<s> not = now  </s>
<s> congratulations on your purchase. the hp mini 110 is much easier to find in retail outlets, so at least you can see what it's like in person.  </s>
<s> the samsung nc10 is much more difficult to find in retail brick-and-mortar stores, so you'd have to order one and have it shipped to you.  </s>
<s> btw a fair number of netbooks have six-cell batteries that stick out in a rather inelegant manner, e.g. dell, hp, acer, and so forth.  </s>
<s> although the extended battery life makes up for it, and then some.  </s>
<s> be safe!  </s>
<s> the battery on this on goes straight down, creating a ninety-degree angle.  </s>
<s> it's a little odd to hold, it can potentially be a handle.  </s>
<s> but i hesitate to pack it without taking the batter off.  </s>
<s> i'll look into an extra smaller battery, that way i can pack it away, and have a few extra hours in the bag.  </s>
