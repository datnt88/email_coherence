in the e machines t640 i posted earlier with the bad onboard graphics i tested and tested and found it was a bad motherboard.i need to know if i get a new motherboard a biostar geforce 6100-m9 socket 939 matx mb w/lan snd vid.will i be able to transfer all of the old parts from the bad board to the new one?
oem operating systems are locked to the motherboard and generally cannot be transferred. you can call emachines about that and see if they'd be willing to help you out, but chances are you'd need to start looking into purchasing a new copy of windows. other than that it should be a relatively smooth transition. john p.s. for those wondering, that is an emachines t6420, not a t640.
now you need to download the specs on the biostar and see if it supports your pc 3200 ram at 400mhz and if it supports your amd 64 3400+ cpu. everything else should work. they are however not necessarily interchangeable in the sense that you can install it and boot up your old operating system. you may (probably) have to re-install, so make sure you have the necessary cd's along with any applications. otherwise look for an identical motherboard as the one you had.
