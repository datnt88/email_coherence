<s> while some recent games like &quot;plants vs. zombies&quot; don't tax such a machine anything richer will not be happy.  </s>
<s> all the corners have been cut on cpu, gpu, ram so let's just say that's not a gamer machine.  </s>
<s> upgrading could cost as much as a xbox 360.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i wouldn't try to play anything created within the last five, six, seven years on that.  </s>
<s> you will be able to play web games just fine, but you won't really be able to play any offline games that one would care about at this point in time (except maybe starcraft or warcraft iii).  </s>
<s> as said, buying an xbox 360 would probably be easier and cheaper.  </s>
<s> what games were you planning to play on this?  </s>
<s> um ya i think maybe doom could play on that... :p lol jk but seriously if you want to play any recent games atleast upgrade your ram, get up to like 2.5 gigs or something, your graphics card could prolly play most games, just defenentally not top notch, maybe like lowest settings, and your cpu is pretty slow, maybe if it was atleast like 2.3ghz or 2.4 you would be alright but 1.8 is prolly just too slow.  </s>
<s> sorry but no. i had a 7600 gt that played call of duty 4 on low settings.  </s>
<s> so a 7300 wouldn't probably be even able to play it.  </s>
<s> as has already been said, it would be cheaper to buy a xbox 360 if your wanting to play all the new games.  </s>
<s> you could get away with upgrading the ram and buying a cheaper graphics card, all for maybe around $180.  </s>
<s> but you still won't play the newest games all that well.  </s>
