<s> i have a hp pavillion 8756 that i just upgraded to xp from me, i find it kind of slow and would like to upgrade my ram.... i have 2 x 126mb sticks and would like to put in 2 x 256mb sticks.  </s>
<s> (there are only 2 slots on the mother board) problem is that i'm not too sure what speed these ram sticks are...probably 133mhz but, how can i be sure before i go ahead and purchase the 2 new sticks???? is there a way to find out in the computer configuration?  </s>
<s> i don't have my original books either!!!!  </s>
<s> many online computer hardware stores such as offer automated services to determine exactly what kind of sticks and max ram a machine can use.  </s>
<s> here is a link to all of the specs for the pavilion 8756. the first chart states that your computer uses pc100 sdram, not pc133.  </s>
<s> be careful when purchasing an upgrade...some pc133 sdram is backwards compatible with pc100, but not all.  </s>
<s> hope this helps, john  </s>
