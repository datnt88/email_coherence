i have a hp pavillion 8756 that i just upgraded to xp from me, i find it kind of slow and would like to upgrade my ram.... i have 2 x 126mb sticks and would like to put in 2 x 256mb sticks. 
(there are only 2 slots on the mother board) problem is that i'm not too sure what speed these ram sticks are...probably 133mhz but, how can i be sure before i go ahead and purchase the 2 new sticks???? is there a way to find out in the computer configuration? 
i don't have my original books either!!!! 
many online computer hardware stores such as offer automated services to determine exactly what kind of sticks and max ram a machine can use. 
here is a link to all of the specs for the pavilion 8756. the first chart states that your computer uses pc100 sdram, not pc133. 
be careful when purchasing an upgrade...some pc133 sdram is backwards compatible with pc100, but not all. 
hope this helps, john
