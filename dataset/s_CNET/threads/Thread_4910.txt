726	2	269432	2615565	2615524	spaceguy	10/26/07 9:58 am	1.19339268e12	that's a good thought, but...	...i'm rather ticked off about having such a problem occur only a month after spending over $1000 on a new computer. i should not have to pay out of my own pocket to fix a design flaw.
726	3	269432	2615591	2615487	willy	10/26/07 11:26 am	1.19339796e12	depends	multiple speed fans are doing their job when they encounter increase temps. once cooled enough they will throttle down or up if the temp increases. if the bios cpu temp is too conservative you may increase it(only abit). you can also, select to &quot;shutdown&quot; rather than reboot if that's the cause. many a system will upon initial boot=up kick-in high then settle as the system handles the temp from whatever means. dust alone defeat heatsinks and/or fan(s) as they collect on fins, etc.. it does happen that a design flaw can exist, but it maybe more of pushing the envelope for certain cpus or poor wire harness routing and/or airflow in a case. just my 2-cents tada -----willy

726	7	269432	2615618	2615634	spaceguy	10/26/07 12:42 pm	1.19340252e12	but why the constant overtemp?	i think the system is performing properly (i.e., increase fan speed and shut down to prevent high-temp damage), but i think the cooling is inadequate or the temp setpoints are too low. normal operation should not constantly cause overtemp/shutdown situations.
726	8	269432	2615658	2615618	r. proffitt	10/26/07 12:51 pm	1.19340306e12	designers disagree...	and i saw that on a recent fun box i made. it had a mbtx board and the intel cooler. it would by design run the cpu fan at maximum on power up. since the board, bios, cooler and all were made by intel let's lay the issue at their feet. thankfully a new bios picked a not at maximum rpm setting on power up... bob
726	9	269432	2616256	2615613	willy	10/27/07 9:39 am	1.19347794e12	another 2-cents	intel p4 cpus have a build-in temp sensor above any system sensors. the fact that the cpu gets turned-on sets the cpu at a level from x-degress above that int. rating, thus the fan kicks-on to high rate then settles as the difference is less of the rate its suppose to turn on at, throttles down. when cold, it starts to heat-up quickly and it senses that, thus usually for many an oem system, its high fan rpm time. this all int. to the cpu and no user action is desired or required. if the case gets hot later or remains at a hot level, then consider the cooling of the case. this in turn allows the airflow to come into play. thus frt. panel air inlets and fans exhasuting int. air creates the airflow. a good airflow system maybe defeated by &quot;objects&quot; in the air path to include cables/harness, devices, cards, or too small of a case. however, since most system are &quot;air cooled&quot; y fans and multiple ones at that, it does get noisy. further, i don't see many makers using pricey less noisy fans. but high rpm fans will make noise. as for auto reboots, that's an item to consider. but think if the system remains on the damage is far greater from heat stress and/or possible fire, thus the auto &quot;shutdown&quot; rather than a reboot. i had this happen during electric storms, etc. and/or lose power or be intermittent and have the system reboot then before it finishes loses power again. i have not noticed this before as i was always gone, but when i saw it, entered the bios to enable &quot;shutdown&quot; rather than reboot during system failure. as for your psu fan, if that's an issue and possible problem then maybe its the root cause. because the psu fan is the primary exhaust for heat build-up. its not entirely unusual to have a bad psu over the life of the system, but in such a short time, that's not good. in either case, if you feel its warrants support then do note down all actions for such. repeated repairs/fixes is a reason for warranty being granted. tada -----willy

(card jaming flaw!) and psu flaw. 1st move the tv tuner card down a slot. where they put it at the factory is far to close and does not allow the heat to escape causing a progressive temp spike. on top of that (after doing a voltage test) when the fan goes into its screaming spin up, the power spikes over the psu max. (even at low speed test showed 403w take from a 400 watt.) i called gateway and got a replacement 8500gt card and replaced the psu myself. havent had 1 reboot problem since. hope this helps.&quot;

726	93	269432	2710913	2710634	abstrait	2/21/08 3:18 pm	1.20360708e12	dhl	well, just to report the other side, i've had great luck wih dhl on a number of occasions. perhaps it depends on the contractors and the responsibility of people in the area. indeed, i just received a vintage road bike that was valuable. it was packed perfectly and delivered just as fine. the drivers were friendly and polite. i think i've had about 10 dealings with dhl and all have been fine, although all were coming this way. you do a search online, and you'll run into anomosity and contempt for ups, usps, fedex, fedex ground, dhl, etc, etc. i dont think there is a single shipping company that's not been singled at as part of the circle of hell. on another note, the first thing i do when confronted with issues with a piece of gear is to research it online to see if there are similar experiences. i try to at least have a handle on the problem before i even deal with any of the companies, no matter what the product. the fact is, we often have better access to knowledge than the company support, something that's almost a given these days whether it be computers or other gear. boutique or cottage builders are another matter, usually offering far more support, at a cost, but often worth it. but it's become a near cliche not to depend on the end support from major companies. sad but true. best thing is to really arm yourself with knowledge as much as possible. i've havent bought my new computer yet, waiting to get more info. so far, regarding this problem, it seems the bios fix, at least the latest version, is batting a pretty good average. still, gateway has received some pretty mediocre service reviews, with or without acer.

(my boyfriends a technician, he basically sets new pc's up and running and he said for an average laptop it takes him 2 hours to set up but for some reason the way toshiba's made it's set up in an hour!) so consider that, and they're cheap, my mom bought one for 950 dollars with decent specs, 2gigs ram, dual core etc... and i'm getting myself one too, this is too much for me, the bsods are killing me) so if you still want a hp or any other computer for that matter make sure it's got mmore than 2gigs of ram ideally 4 is vista's soft spot!

(otherwise you get the bsod. there are instructions for this throughout this thread --much earlier). since that time, 18 hours ago, the 5478 has been continuously on in an unairconditioned room without a crash. (don't worry, i'll put the air on soon.) and the hard drive is as quiet as could be-- compared to that constant crunching that was happening when vista was &quot;in charge.&quot; i have no idea which combination of these items did the trick, but i think it was getting a proper xp installed. the computer now seems so &quot;civilized&quot;.
