is there a way to reconfigure the sleep function on the keyboard (upper left hand corner of keyboard, above the escape button) to allow for the hibernate function?, or is that something that must be done in the hp dv 6928 pavilion i use? if i can make an adjustment, via some adjustment to the registry or whatever, please be extremely detailed.
shows you could tell it to do that instead of sleep.
to r. proffitt: -- i have windows vista home premium: control panel &gt; power options &gt; what to do when i press buttons (see left column) &gt; adjust to hibernate when pressig the sleep button. terrific. thanks for waking me up!, robert
but i see you took the lead and found where it was on your machine. glad it helped!
you reminded me that i had to wake up and think. thanks for your guidance. robert
