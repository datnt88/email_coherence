my keyboard wont let me type a buton more than once without me waiting like 1 or 2 seconds before i can type it again. for example if i want to type wwww i need to wait a delay between each button press.any help on how to fix it? ty very much for any help.
see if you can navigate through the bios without problems. it could be a setting, a question of available resources, cpu heat issue, etc. as well, how long has this been going on? does it get better for a while after a reboot, etc.?
you didn't mention what type of kybd. connection you have, usb or std. ps/2 or any of its traits. it matters as usb tend to freak out as they're serviced like any other attached device under the os. while the ps/2 is a more dedicated one based on h/w. check the bios for kybd. buffer and/or similar label. to quickly test the kybd. swap it out and check results. kybds., do fail or become flaky from wear&tear. also, if this is somewhat battery operated, replace with new one. you can turn the kybd. over and &quot;burp it&quot; by rapping it backside to loosen any crud or possible metal object(staple) lodged inside. tada -----willy
