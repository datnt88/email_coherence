<s> i just purchased a dell laptop that came with a free 802.11g netgear router.  </s>
<s> i currently have a linksys 802.11b router with one wired desktop (windows 2000), 2 wireless desktops (one running xp - one 2000) and three laptops (xp).  </s>
<s> my question is .. do i need to get two netgear usb adapters to replace the linksys adapters or will they work with the new router( at the slower speed).  </s>
<s> i figured i would ask before i start ripping everything apart and have no internet in the house.  </s>
<s> thanks for any assistance jim  </s>
<s> have the ability to discriminate between ''b'' and ''g'' adapters without setting the speed to the lowest common denominator.  </s>
<s> if lan transfers are not an issue then you can live with the mixed mode method, elsewise upgrade to all ''g''.  </s>
<s> g02.11g is backwards compatible with 802.11g you are just restricted to 802.11b speeds  </s>
