never moved a mobo before, considering instead of modding the hp case, to just move to a larger case. no idea how to make sure this mobo will be able to screw down into a new case or not.
would antec cases advertised as &quot;up to standard atx&quot; mean that it will have screw mounts for a matx? or a uatx? (they are the same thing correct?) i really like the super lanboy and p160 (especially the removable mobo tray)
decent new cases provide multiple mounting post(s) as not all are needed to conform to whatever mtrbd. is out there up to a point. you may get lucky and use enough mounting posts to align and maintain postion of the mtrbd. or be ok regardless. i suggest whatever case you get has a &quot;removable&quot; bulkhead an area where the ports are located. that way, you swap a proper bulkhead to fit what the mtrbd. is configued for, this is a physical item. if unable to match, then leave &quot;off/open&quot; and still have access to all ports. also, decent cases provide a selection(usually 2) bulkhead panels to choose from. if not, various online vendors can provide that if available. this is the curse of oem type systems, as they're made for thier needs and not necessarily conform to generic offering. tada -----willy
in the mounting plate for the micro atx, et al.
panel for the i/o's. they may not be standard overall dimension. if they are you should be able to take the one from the old case and snap it in.
