helo, can any one of you suggest me some free software which can burn the commercial dvd's !!!. i bought a maddog cd -r/rw drive. how do you rate this product !!! thanks
you need to define what a &quot;commercial dvd&quot; is. i'm guessing you mean the silver cds or dvds that you buy with music or video content. if so, then you may want to know that such are not &quot;burned&quot; but are &quot;pressed&quot;. does that help? as to the mad dog. it's a value unit that should last a year or two but isn't very expensive. bob
thanks a lot for the quick reply. i want to copy the movie dvd's which are in a different language and my wedding dvd's which i want to copy. thanks
i use dvdshrink to copy dvds since it makes it so easy. given the nature of the program, i will only note you find it with google.com and will not write any more about it. bob
hi proffitt, thanks a lot for your reply. i will install and try this. thanks
