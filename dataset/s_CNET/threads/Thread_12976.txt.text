hey, i've just installed a sata hard-drive as a secondary hard drive and it wont recognize it....it's win xp, and the mobo is an asus sli premium...any tips?
have you formatted the drive? xp won't see it without the drivers, and a friend found it necessary to also format it [used a win 98 boot floppy]. installing the sata as the boot drive using xp original install is a different matter. then you need to create a floppy from the mobo driver cd, hit the f6 key when offered and later insertt the floppy created, so that xp will install the mobo drivers. confusing because it asks the question ere raid or scsi, but that actually includes sata drivers.
you may have to activate it. i did. go to my computer. right click. go to manage. you can figure it out from there. pretty straightforward. and life goes on... jack
did you activate or turn on the sata controller in the bios ? vapcmd
just sayin thanks....i figured it out eventually on my own, and that's all i had to do lol, i kinda feel dumb, but now i know haha
