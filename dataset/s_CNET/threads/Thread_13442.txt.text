when trying to bootup pc,all i get is a blank screen and the pc makes single long beeps.
tell us the specs of your computer and what kind?
you may have some loose cables. otherwise may i ask if you have swapped out ram on the computer? if so you may have put in the wrong ram. thats the only time i ever heard my computer beep to me.
