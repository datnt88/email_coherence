<s> it has zoom facility or not in video recording or in time of steel capture?? can we watch videos n can video be seen frm both verical n horizontal directions...??  </s>
<s> seems to have a lot of folk asking questions today.  </s>
<s> my question is &quot;what is steel capture?&quot; as to the video watching, playback apps are widely available now so if one player does not do what you want, why not try another?  </s>

<s> i just missed out...i means many of samsung phone dosnt have the zoominf facility while video recording and the time of image capture..dats y im asking 4...it has d facility or nt??  </s>
<s> sorry but with the misspellings and typographic errors i can barely guess what the questions are.  </s>
<s> tablets do not substitute for a camera or camcorder.  </s>
<s> but keep in mind that any &quot;app&quot; can be replaced so if the supplied app does not do &quot;steel capture&quot; why would we not look for a replacement for better captures of steel images?  </s>
<s> as of my posting there are 10 more hours on that sale and they were not sold out.  </s>

<s> u r not entering into my point .....i just asked u dat the camera has the zooming facility or not?? u can simply tell yes or no...  </s>
<s> the(d)...dnt get confused on that..  </s>
<s> you are using shortened words such as u instead of you and then &quot;dat&quot; and &quot;steel capture&quot; without correcting your posts.  </s>
<s> i can't enter into your point if you don't use english or correct your posts.  </s>
<s> but if you are asking if the camera has zoom, it's clear from the specifications at that it does not have zoom or compare with any digital camera or camcorder.  </s>

<s> folk may not understand what you are asking.  </s>
