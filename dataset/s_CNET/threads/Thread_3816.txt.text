hi, i have 2 toshiba laptops both operating on xp and have wireless network setup. i am able to get on the internet with both but i can only check email on one of them. i am using hotmail as email account and when i log in and wait for it to open my mailbox, i get a page cannot be displayed error. anyone have any trouble shooting ideas. i have tried my gmail account also to no avail on the one machine so i don't think it is the email provider something with my settings on the one laptop. any ideas greatly appreciated. thanks, doug
is it up to date?
hi, i am using a linksys router that i just bought last week at best buy so i would assume everything would be up to date??
can't assume that. latest version: 4.20.7 release date: 8/25/2005 the mfg. could have boxed your router months ago.
if it is the router's software, why would hotmail and other email work on my other computer??? wouldn't it be all or nothing? thanks in advance
some webpages, including free webmail sites, have objects in them (javascript, activex, etc.) that have the potential to install/behave like malware. there are software routines in your computer that can be blocking these (antispyware, firewalls, etc.). routers often contain firewalls and filters, too. r. proffit was wise in recommending a firmware upgrade. at least you can eliminate the router's firmware in your troubleshooting.
in internet options, what happens when you clear all cookies and delete files (offline files, too)?
that new meant you didn't have to check the firmware. in short since i've already noted the firmware must be checked... here's why. the mtu may be too high and email retrieval will fail for some. to fix this issue, the newer firmware addresses this so you don't have to. let's remove the firmware from the probable list of causes. bob
