picked up a new motherboard 4 20$ yay for me lol. i wanted it because it works, was cheap, but mainly because it can hold up to 4gb of ram. i'm not a pro at this but i love my games. the only problem is that it has 5 pci slot 1 agu and no pci-e slots. can any one name a few of the best card i can fit in a pci slot? and or agu. ps. under 200$ would help this poor boy
1. newegg.com to see what agp cards may be had for under 200 bucks. 2. armed with that list i head to tomshardware.com and see how each card fares on the vgacharts. just so you know, i won't do this for you. bob
''agu'' slot? i think you mean ''agp.'' what is the manufacturer name and model name of your motherboard? what are the rest of the components in your computer build? you won't use more than 2gb of ram for gaming, so getting a 4gb motherboard is not an issue. if you pay more for a motherboard with a pci express x16 expansion slot, you likely can get a more powerful pci express x16 video card for a price less than a comparable agp video card.
thanks for the links very helpful
