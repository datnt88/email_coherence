11920	0	129500	1462346	nr	jamepc	10/7/05 11:00 am	1.1286828e12	network problems	i have 2 desktops and a inspiron 8200 on my network. the desktops are connected via a nic and the inspiron via belkin pre-n card. a belkin pre-n router connects them all. it seems i'm having trouble with the inspiron's wireless connection. i have internet access, i can print to other printers on the desktops, and i setup quickbooks to access the file on a desktop. however the inspiron can't see the desktops in workgroup computers, can't access the shared files that show up in my network and it doesn't show up in the desktops workgroup computers. the desktops can't print to the inspiron's printer. all this happens with all firewalls disabled. how can i get full access with all the computers? win xp thank you.
