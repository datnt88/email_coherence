<s> alright, so i'm new to this forum, so please excuse if i'm doing something wrong.  </s>
<s> but a few months ago i purchased a custom-built desktop from someone.  </s>
<s> my intent was to use it for minor-gaming, and so i did. it worked for a month or maybe a little more than a month and all of a sudden one day i got home from school and i tried to start it up, and it didn't turn on.  </s>
<s> it was working fine the night before, and the next day, nothing.  </s>
<s> i don't know what could have happen, but my father unplugs things every morning before going to work, maybe that could have done something.  </s>
<s> i opened it up to look around.  </s>
<s> one thing was unplugged, that was the power led, the other thing is the atx sw however, that was plugged in.  </s>
<s> i messed around with it for awhile and nothing seemed to work.  </s>
<s> i then shifted the wires a bit, and what i got from it was a blue led light on the power button when the system is powered on.  </s>
<s> that didn't happen before from what i recall.  </s>
<s> i also took out the psu and tested it using the paper clip method, and the method worked, the psu fan was spinning, but when i plug it back into the mobo, it doesn't work, nothing turns on but that blue led light on the power button in the front.  </s>
<s> no sign of power, no fan, or anything.  </s>
<s> i also tried to remove my 4gb of ram memory, that did nothing.  </s>
<s> i don't know what else can be done, help please?  </s>
<s> i spent a decent dollar on it.. i don't remember specifics on specs, all i remember is that my mobo is a biostar sata2 a780l3g v6.1 and i had 4g of ram.  </s>
<s> could be simple.  </s>
<s> that old extra mounting post problem.  </s>
<s> keep telling more.  </s>
<s> full details such as the 200 watt psu and the 8800 video card.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i don't remember any specs, and my psu just says on it thermaltake purepower atx 12v 2.2 550 and it says that the combined power of +5v and +3.3v is 141w max.  </s>
<s> and some new ones, i think there is not enough here to hazard any guess at what it is.  </s>
<s> since you own the machine and don't have make, model, or a story the next stop is the repair shop.  </s>
