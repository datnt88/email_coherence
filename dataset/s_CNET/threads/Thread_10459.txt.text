im thinking of getting wireless router, but i was told others would be able to log in to my internet. is there a way to prevent this from happening? thank you for everything...
yes, by enabling the wep encryption.
wep is one area of security, mac filtering is another. this will allow/disallow wireless devices from connecting.
