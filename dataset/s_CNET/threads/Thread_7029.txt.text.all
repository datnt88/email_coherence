<s> i am using a windows xp professional computer.  </s>
<s> i just bought the microsoft wireless optical desktop 1000 to replace the same set.  </s>
<s> the set contains a wireless mouse and a wireless keyboard.  </s>
<s> when i move the cursor to the right edge of the screen with the mouse, the cursor will often will move on its own to a different place on the screen.  </s>
<s> i tried adjusting some of the settings in the mouse properties screen but that didn't seem to help.  </s>
<s> what could be causing this problem and how do i fix it?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> richard  </s>
<s> pack it up and return as defective.  </s>
<s> if it is wireless or not, the optical mouse some times have the same problem, even the laptop tracker.  </s>
<s> its because of 3 reasons.  </s>
<s> the first one is the mouse pad on which you move the mouse.  </s>
<s> some colors doesn't reflect the rays from the mouse.  </s>
<s> so if you move the mouse to the color where it can reflect it the mouse pointer jumps to it.  </s>
<s> second thing the mouse battery as well as the tracking of wireless receiver and your mouse.  </s>
<s> don't take the mouse to near the receiver and press the button to identify it.  </s>
<s> put the mouse in a place where you are going to use it and press the buttons at the bottom of the mouse and the receiver.  </s>
<s> third one is the driver.  </s>
<s> check the driver is correct.  </s>
