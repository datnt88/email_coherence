<s> i bought a computer from cyberpower. it keeps killing video cards.  </s>
<s> it seems like a cooling problem. the case temps range from 22c to 24c. it came with 2 cooling fans in the case.  </s>
<s> would more fans help?  </s>
<s> do you think it might be something else?  </s>
<s> (motherboard, bios, etc..) any suggestions?  </s>
<s> (5 times) nvidia geforce-4 ti4200 128mb ddr 8x agp w/ tv-out & dvi (current) albatron ti4280ep (this one lasted almost 1 year)but it's failing now  </s>
<s> have you replaced the power supply?  </s>
<s> the computer is only a little over a year old.  </s>
<s> i just pulled up my invoice.  </s>
<s> it's an atx 430w p4 power supply with dual fans.  </s>
<s> retail is approx 80 bucks.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't think it's going bad already.  </s>
<s> if the computer were 5-6 years old, and it was a cheap power supply, maybe.  </s>
<s> i am getting no indications (random reboots, smell, sounds, etc) that it's going bad.  </s>
<s> you are in a situation where you have to swap hardware until you figure out what is wrong with the system. the most likely cause of a video card going bad, over and over, is incorrect voltage from the motherboard, and that is most likely due to a faulty power supply.  </s>
<s> you can get something like a sparkle power supply, 450watts or so, for around $50. that is the first step in trying to figure out where the problem is. the only other thing to replace is the motherboard.  </s>
<s> those are the only 2 things that really could cause what you are seeing.  </s>
