my sister-in-law has a gateway computer with a dvd drive installed. since reinstalling the os from the gateway recovery disk, her dvd player will not read dvd's. you can put a cd or a dvd in and open explorer and view the contents. but, when you use a dvd player program (and i tried several to see if it was just a software problem) the programs come back with a message stating that no dvd player was found. everything looks good in device manager, my computer shows it as a dvd player, and i've gone through an updated all the drivers. any thoughts on this??? thanks, cameron
a little history of why the os was reloaded (some oses just get reinfected with worms upon such reinstalls), what dvd player gateway supplied and no mention of what os. write a little more. bob
sorry, bob, i should have put more information on it. os (win 98) was reinstalled after a full reformat of the hd. i can't remember now why she felt like she needed to do that. the dvd was a gateway installed ... the manufacturer started with an &quot;m&quot;, but i can't remember exactly who it was. i'll e-mail her and find out. thanks for your help. cameron
it does have issues with drivers. the motherboard, audio, video and such drivers all need to be installed before i would expect a dvd to work. but if i look at powerdvd, it's default install in some versions needs a little help in finding the drive letter of the dvd. its in some options menu but since there are any number of versions, i leave it to you to find the menu and setting. next, the cd/dvd drives must not have any driver in config.sys. please share the contents of the config.sys file to make sure it's ok. bob
