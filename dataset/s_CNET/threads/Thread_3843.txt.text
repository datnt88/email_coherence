my computer crashed and i reinstalled windows 98 and now my computer only shows a 16 color and i need the 16 bit color to run the access manager for my high speed internet.
&quot;windows 98 and now my computer only shows a 16 color &quot; please install your video card drivers.
you obviously have more work ahead of you besides the video drivers. motherboard/chipset, nic, audio, modem etc. are but a few of the necessary software needed to run the machine correctly. make and model of the machine will yield more info.
