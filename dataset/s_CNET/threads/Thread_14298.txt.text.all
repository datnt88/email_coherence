<s> i have a question.  </s>
<s> is it better to have a weaker graphic card paired up with a fast cpu for gaming performance, or a nice graphic card paired up with slow cpu. which will have an edge for gaming, and basically any other things???  </s>
<s> either way, its bad.  </s>
<s> fast cpu with slow gpu will have ok loading times, but the worst graphics.  </s>
<s> slow cpu with fast gpu will look pretty good, but will be so laggy.. how about an okay cpu with an okay gpu?  </s>
<s> 3200+ with a 6600?  </s>
<s> cheaper, you say?  </s>
<s> 3000+ with a x300 cheaper?!?! 2800+ with a 6200  </s>
<s> i would say go with amd 3000+venice and 6600  </s>
