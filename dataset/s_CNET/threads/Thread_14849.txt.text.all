<s> are you talking about ram or the hard drive.  </s>
<s> i've never seen a memory test take 10 hours.  </s>
<s> and are you sure about that link, it doesn't work.  </s>
<s> yes try that one, its an iso bootable file, and it test the memory and in mine it takes about 10 hours, and not yet finish... i hope you can help.. is there another way how to fix my ram?  </s>
<s> yes i already try it, but it takes me 10 hours, im busy so that i can waited that long... is the test can fix my ram? or there another way how to fix it?  </s>
<s> sorry, to fix the ram you replace it with good ram.  </s>
<s> today's ram technology doesn't include the concept of being able to repair it.  </s>

<s> you system ram.  </s>
<s> but after it's gone through a number of cycles called &quot;passes&quot;, it will show a problem or not.  </s>
<s> it cannot 'fix&quot; anything....it can only tell you if the ram passes or does not pass all the ram tests in the system it's installed in.  </s>
<s> what results do you get from memtest86+ after three passes ??? vapcmd  </s>
<s> buy a compatible memory module of 512 or 1024 mb. (you'll like the 1024) turn the power off to the computer and open the cover.  </s>
<s> locate the ram and remove the old module by unlatching two small clips.  </s>
<s> once you have the old ram in your hand drift it into the trash.  </s>
<s> now install the new ram, carefully observing it is located properly (only one way it goes in slot).  </s>
<s> reassemble, power up and carry on.  </s>
<s> many folks might take &quot;turn the power off to the computer and open the cover.&quot; as just turning off the pc and we both know that 'power off' doesn't really disconnect power from the pc or mb. vapcmd  </s>
<s> thanks to everyone, i concluded that should buy a new ram... thanks.. more power!!!! cnet forums... i helps a lot!!!  </s>
<s> try one of these: i use one, they work.  </s>
<s> i'd suggest this one: i know, i know, not since the days of dos, worthless piece of crap, scam, yada, yada, yada.  </s>
<s> not every one agrees about ram optimizers.  </s>
