i'm looking into purchasing a monitor, hopefully by tonight, but i'm having a hard time deciding on which one. 
any help is greatly appreciated. 
hanns-g acer oh, and btw, i do some casual gaming, some cs source, hopefully sc2, and probably going to hook up my xbox 360 onto it. 
and yea, that samsung 226bw... i could get for about 275 total also but i really dunno. 
please help!!! best regards, chris 
see the negative comment about dvd playback on the other... 
if u have about 600 bucks to spend, undoubtedly, the dell 2407wfp is by far the best monitor out there in its class. 
24&quot; widescreen, crystal clear picture, usb ports, card reader built in, pip, 1920 x 1200, amazing !
