i have installed seagate 3tb, and want to use only this with my p8p57 motherboard, problem is that when i format with mbr i get 2tb space, how do i get access to 700gb rest space? if i install with windows disk management tool i get whole 3tb, but its guid and windows installation on primary dirve doesnt support that only mbr support that, so whats the solution please? thx
if your os is xp, then that's it, 2.2gb limit. there is nothing you can do and even if so, it would be another cost and hassle. only the newer mtrbds. and vista and later os(64-bit) will work as clean as possible. visit the seagate support website and review it's faq.  tada -----willy

there is no cure at the moment if you use mbr. here it offered a choice of mbr or gpt. maybe you should try the other? bob
