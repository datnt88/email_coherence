hi, i m mukut from bangladesh. when i turn off my pc,i do it directly.i mean i do not click shut down from pc,directly switched off from main electricity line.is it harmful for my pc?and i dnt have ups.
you can do that. however, it makes sense to assure that anything else on that same ac line is reduced. meaning, all devices shouldn't all be connected as well, it just helps to reduce the strain. not knowing how your ac current behaves in your area should make you get a &quot;surge protector&quot; as to help protect that circuit as a minimum. getting a ups will be helpful at a later time when you can. tada -----willy
are you saying you have the os running and you just drop power.....pull the plug? if so that might not be a good thing to do......corrupted files and such. best to allow the os to go through a normal shutdown......puts things away in an orderly fashion. then you can drop power.
