<s> my 3300c and 3400c died with a dead sensor unit.  </s>
<s> repair exceeded a new scanner (after shipping), so i have a new working scanner.  </s>
<s> i'll write &quot;most likely.&quot;  </s>
<s> if you want to post an image somewhere for the forum to look at, please do.  </s>

<s> what would be the best way to scan and send photo for you to see?  </s>
<s> i find the geocities/yahoo to be fairly painless.  </s>
<s> but let's be clear here, if the scanner fails on another machine, cost of repair (including shipping) exceeds the cost of a new scanner.  </s>
<s> parts outside of an external usb/parallel cable or a wall power supply are not obtainable.  </s>
<s> well, lamps are, but not much else.  </s>

<s> &quot;control the color duplicating&quot; this is about the boiled down version of your issue that i can read.  </s>
<s> let me make a few comments and then see what pops up.  </s>
<s> but first, with every post is this tip: &quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot;  </s>
<s> no notation from you about the color settings of the video card.  </s>
<s> there are a few that are unaware that to display photos on the screen with any quality, you really need to be far beyond the 16-color, 26-color and even 65-thousand color settings.  </s>
<s> the 3300c (when ours was working) did just fine and produced a number of good scans.  </s>
<s> while one could fault it for not being color-accurate, the truth is it's a consumer grade device and we can't get pantone accurate colors.  </s>
<s> add that most pc's displays are wildly inaccurate and some pictures look terrible.  </s>
<s> after using such things for some time, you get used to what's good and what indicates a problem.  </s>
<s> more words on your part or propping a scan up anywhere may reveal more.  </s>
<s> more words meaning sentences like &quot;i set the scanner to 600 dpi, 24 bit-color and saved it as a jpeg image&quot; reveals a lot about the process you are using.  </s>
<s> read your posts and you can't tell much.  </s>
<s> tell more and post an image somewhere.  </s>
