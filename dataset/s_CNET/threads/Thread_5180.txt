(so it definately not modemn issue) something is going on in my computer. it is not software issue since i have try safe mode networking many times, and my internet speed still fluctuates, so this rule out the software conflict problem. i scan my computer with all of these: norton, mcafee, kaspersky, housecall, esset, including malwarebyte and lavasoft, and found nothing!! if there is a virus in my computer, then it super powerful then since all of these anti-virus cannot even detect them. (unlikely it is virus issue) my computer is very hot though, and it have some sound like something is running inside. maybe my computer is overheated? how to know if the nic or network card inside my computer is not working correctly? my internet is so slow right now, i am so frusterated, thank you for helping me.
5330	3	570346	5347912	5347940	r. proffitt	8/15/12 1:40 pm	1.345038e12	about that uninstall.	you don't want to know how many times i've read that then we get the hijackthis log to find out it's still there. -&gt; there is another test i use and that's to boot up a live cd call ubuntu. no install and i can test the connection. as to what you know about norton, sadly they did change how it works so can we skip all this back and forth about it's not that? -&gt; and not a word about that cord mentioned in the other discussion? why not? bob
5330	4	570346	5347913	5347912	help84	8/15/12 2:02 pm	1.34503932e12	thank you sir	oh sorry, i understand now. but how can i do the hijackthis log? how can i get the hijack log? sorry i am not very good with computer. thank you
5330	5	570346	5347945	5347913	r. proffitt	8/15/12 2:08 pm	1.34503968e12	before you tackle any log file.	did you try a shorter cord from the dsl modem to the wall as noted in that other discussion? about the hijackthis log. it's not for everyone and while i really like what it shows it is advanced skill to read it. i want to be humble here and write i do know a bit about this but am not as expert as those that do this all the time. example at  again, while i do read such things, it's usually only to point out the obvious items. even you could run that tool and see if any item is left over from norton, mcafee and the like. usually easy to spot. try it. but ask others about this (see the link in this post!!!) before you delete it. bob

5330	7	570346	5348229	5348233	help84	8/16/12 1:04 pm	1.34512224e12	i have check, also run in safe mode networking	i have check all those already. i also do a test on safe mode networking, and it is still same, so the problem is nothing with startup software. safe mode networking is when no software start up, it only use the basic window system to start your computer. even in safe mode, my speed still fluctuates, like right now i only have 15kb/sec , very very slow. thank you bob, i head over there to see if i can get any help, and i look more into the hijackthislog, thank you sir.
