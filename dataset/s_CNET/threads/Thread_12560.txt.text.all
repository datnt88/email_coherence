<s> built this computer for a friend and they where havign issues with it rebooting for no appernt reason.  </s>
<s> so i got the computer back from them installed a after market cpu fan thinking it was possibly a heat issue, and formatted and reinstalled windows just in case it had a possible virus.  </s>
<s> while i was installing windows it rebooted one time and i had to restart the install.  </s>
<s> then i got it installed got everything updated got avg/adware/spybot on it and updated.  </s>
<s> then i took the computer back to the friend house and while i was settign it up for them it rebooted again on me, and sevreal more times while i was trying to do other things.  </s>
<s> when i submitted the error reports to microsoft it spit back one of two things, driver error source unknown and possibly a memory problem.  </s>
<s> but once again it coulnt pin point anything on ethier of the error reports.  </s>
<s> i know its not a virus, so im thinking its etheir a hardware issue or a driver issue.  </s>
<s> possible bad memory.  </s>
<s> any ideas as how to pin point the problem would be greatly helpful.  </s>

<s> all too often, i teardown the system and place on cardboard.  </s>
<s> test it that way, so no shorts or possible heat issues don't arise.  </s>
<s> if it does, then reduce system to bare minimum and take it from there, swap with other good parts.  </s>
<s> if ram, swap it with known good ones.  </s>
<s> be sure the bios is generic or basic defaults.  </s>
<s> but, be sure to check any cpu voltage are not fluctuating, etc.. a good and decent psu is a must as well for a fully stuffed system, of at least 400w+.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> what power supply it has, so i'm going to surmise that its a value/included with case type thing, and 100% gurantee that any such psu needds to be replaced and is 80% likely the cause of random reboot...  </s>
<s> i totally forgot about the power supply not sure what it is off hand it came with the case when i got it from zipzoomfly, how ever tyhey no longer sell this piticular case so ill have to go to my friends house and physically look at it to find out.  </s>
<s> ill post back when i get the information  </s>
