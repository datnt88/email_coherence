636	1	266393	2597283	2597247	jbking2	10/2/07 9:34 am	1.19131764e12	simple...	what slots on the motherboard would support that new card? there isn't an agp or pci-e slot i think based on a little googling i did about that dell model. why would you assume there is such a slot in on entry level system? regards, jb

636	6	266393	2597329	2597312	hannibal18	10/2/07 10:40 am	1.1913216e12	would it be worth it	how expensive would a pci card be vs. how much better would it be than my integrated?
