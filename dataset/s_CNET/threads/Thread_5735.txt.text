i have a macbook air. i have it connected to a large external monitor and use it mostly like a desktop. what makes most sense for battery life: a) keep it plugged in at all times while using? b) use on battery all the time (up to 100%, run down to 0, back up to 100% ...)? as a rule, i do not turn the computer off, put it to sleep at night, so if you recommend &quot;a&quot;, what about at night? keep it plugged in, or recharge in the morning? and if recharge, run it to 0 first? or what? thanks.
gives you all you need to know about your macbook air battery and how to take care of it. i wonder why you did not just buy a desktop mac instead of a mb air. you have not mentioned moving it around at all. p
i said mostly as a desktop; i do move it around. but thanks for the site; it answered my question.
