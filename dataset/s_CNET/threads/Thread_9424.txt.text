if my motherboard has a pcie x16 can a put a pcie video card in that slot that is not x16?
card that is not x16??? there are x1, x4, x8, slots on some mobos, likely only an x1 on yours. i hope that you are not confusing pci x with the old 33 mhz pci bus.
no not confusing them at all, just want to know in the even a card i get is not 16x will it still work in a 16x slot?
are different for each the x1, x4, x8, and x16. the difference is the number of serial busses they have in parallel, but not sure how the power connections are made. but i doubt that an x1 would work in an x16 slot. however, there is a x1 video card made by matrox.
