<s> my laptop is t60p.  </s>
<s> i have used it for 5 years.  </s>
<s> sometime it's so noise and restart without a reason.  </s>
<s> how can i check and find out the reason?  </s>
<s> tell more about how you cleaned and replaced fans as need be over it's life.  </s>
<s> link -&gt; bob  </s>
<s> i've cleaned 3 months / time and replaced 2 years /time for the fan.  </s>
<s> but now it is still very noise.  </s>
<s> problem maybe not from fan.  </s>
<s> hi. friend the reason is not only by fan.  </s>
<s> you need to check some other hardware as hard disk, power supplier, cd room.  </s>
<s> this is the link that instruct you about some reason for noise of your laptop.  </s>
<s> beside that, you can check the reason of some beep sounds.  </s>
<s> best regard.  </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  </s>
<s> make sure you using your laptop on a smooth hard surface for maximum airflow as well.  </s>
<s> at 5yrs.  </s>
<s> of usage, there is also embedded dust, this is located and also adhears to components.  </s>
<s> this is not the typical dust bunnies but rather the fine dust, that only immediate contact with will clean.  </s>
<s> this as to be directly blown and brushed off.  </s>
<s> plus, if this laptop uses an int.  </s>
<s> cpu fan, it may have failed and the case fan is working hard to maintain coolness.  </s>
<s> if using &quot;heat tube&quot; method, fine dust isolates against best operation and outside air blowing won't do.  </s>
<s> in other words, you have to teardown and clean it all off.  </s>
<s> finally, if this laptop was constantly used with continuing heat stress/build-up, the cpu paste can age and reduce its properties for best performance, re-paste.  </s>
<s> last, over time as already explained above, some component may have started to flake out, if not a easily replaceable item, then rethink any fix.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> you put in a new fan. is the noise from the fan?  </s>
<s> also, at 5 years you replace the heatsink compound.  </s>
<s> sometimes you find old machines that the owner has never had serviced so you do the service.  </s>
