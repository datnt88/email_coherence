<s> so i just bought a 4gb sony memory stick pro duo for my cell, and it came with an adapter, so i can plug it into my laptop.  </s>
<s> however, every time i do, i get a lovely blue screen and a free restart.  </s>
<s> when i put the 256mb sandisk that came with the phone in the adapter, it works fine.  </s>
<s> what's the deal?  </s>
<s> any way to fix it?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> sony models dcr-hc32, dcr-hc42, dsc-m1, dsc-m2, dsc-n1, dsc-s600, dsc-t5, dsc-t5/b, dsc-t5/n, dsc-t5/r, dsc-t7, dsc-t9, and hdr-hc1  </s>
<s> none of those model numbers are anywhere on either the card or the adapter. the apparent model number is msx-m4gst/x.  </s>
<s> i just purchased a &quot;msx-m4gst/x&quot; memory stick, and i've immediatly got a blue screen of death from it.  </s>
<s> after some investigation i've determined this stick is a counterfeit, and a very good one at that.  </s>
<s> there is a guide here which explains the counterfeit chips: i purchased mine on ebay so i'm going through the process of getting a full refund from the seller.  </s>
