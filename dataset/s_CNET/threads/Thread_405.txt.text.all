<s> well i'm planing on buying a pc with the following specs: motherboard: asus striker ii formula cpu : core 2 quad 6600(2.4ghz)  </s>
<s> ram : 4 x 1gb hardisk : 320gb sata optical : asus dvd writer (lightscribe) graphics : 8800gt 512mb will a blue storm power suply (500w) be sufficient?  </s>
<s> you may want to consider replacing it with something with a bit more headroom.  </s>
<s> for example...  </s>
<s> since you've got a high-end mobo and i expect you'll be overclocking, and you could go sli in the future, get a good 700w or larger unit.  </s>
<s> ocz 700w, $125 before $30 rebate: corsair 750w, $130 before $10 rebate:  </s>
<s> thnx. apart from that, do u that ive good specs or is that too much?? i mean, isnt a core 2 duo and 2 gigs sufficient?  </s>
<s> i want my pc to last at least i year.. n i dont know yet if i will overclock or not  </s>
<s> you didn't include a system builder's license of the operating system in your build list. the components looked good to me.  </s>
<s> if i were doing it, i'd prob'ly get 2x2gb rather than 4x1 gb. for my recent build i got 2x2 gb fast ddr2 for under $100 and there's also a $30 mail-in rebate (altho i'm still waiting for it, and we all know rebates don't always actually show up in your mailbox...) 2 sticks are easier to manage on a mobo, plus it leaves me the possibility of bumping up to 8 gb if i need to convert my own machine into a work computer.  </s>
<s> (my work requires good computing power, but home is usually just for gaming/hobby stuff) of course if the os license is a 32-bit, then there's no incentive to go to 4 gb, let alone 8, so can't be sure what's best for your rig.  </s>
<s> that's a $300 motherboard.  </s>
<s> you're wasting that money if you don't plan on overclocking since it will perform just like a $100 mobo at stock speeds.  </s>
<s> also, no reason to pay for an sli board if you don't plan on using 2 video cards.  </s>
<s> it's like buying a z06 corvette and then never getting it past 70mph.  </s>
<s> yeah, a 3ghz core2duo and 2gigs will be &quot;enough&quot;, but i'd still go for 2x2gb ddr2 since it's only another $40-$60.  </s>
<s> go with 2 sticks since you'd have to probably have to run your ram slower or increase the voltage to get 4 sticks up to full speed.  </s>
<s> well i think ill drop the quad and take up the core 2 duo and keep the 4gig ram.  </s>
<s> i'm planing to use vista 64bit(since i'll be on 4gig ram) and i already own a xp licence, so i shall use both.  </s>
<s> anyway, like i said, i want a mobo to last at least 1 year and also play games on medium/high settings xcept for crysis of course). the reason why im opting for the striker 2 is for me t be able to upgrade when more demanding games come out.  </s>
<s> also, is a 8800gt 512mb enough to play cod 4 at high settings.  </s>
<s> ive already bought the card, so there is no reverting back as far as graphics is concern.  </s>
<s> n i'll be playing on a 22&quot; monitor.  </s>
<s> so, is it enough??  </s>
<s> these 4xaa figures are borderline, so 2xaa will be smooth.  </s>
