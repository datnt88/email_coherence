<s> so i was wondering if it was possible to use an add-in card and the intergrated video on a motherboard at the same time..like crossfire.  </s>
<s> ....and if the intergrated video was nvidia that was/is set up as a physx to supplement the ati add-in.  </s>
<s> i am not sure if it is possible i have an original physx ageia card (pci) but now nvidia owns it and maybe they would not let such a thing work.  </s>
<s> like crossfire = no.  </s>
<s> let's keep it short.  </s>
<s> i know it would not look like crossfire; thats ati.  </s>
<s> sli is nvidia.  </s>
<s> i just wanted to know if i could run them at the same time as physx and ati  </s>
<s> as you suspected, the code, the drivers would not do this.  </s>
