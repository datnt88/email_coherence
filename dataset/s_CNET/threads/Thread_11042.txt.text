 click om moterboards on the ;eft side. at mobos you can select mfr'd cpu, et al and then search for those that fit your criteria. i'm a gigabyte fan [they usually cost more]. one thing to check for re the raid controller. find out if the raid ports can only be used for raid or can they be used for ata and also atapi drives. some only support raid, some raid, and ata, and others all three. the ite [gigaraid] supports all 3. may have to go to tomshardware and or anandtech to read the articles that they have on mobos.
home use build up is going to be asus p4r800-vm, other # i recommend is the same except for -deluxe instead of vm, ( vm is micro atx- delux is reg atx-esp for media edition xp) ( mwave is my preferred source of late...)
