<s> hi, i have a geforce 4 ti 4600, which has served me perfectly well in its aging years.  </s>
<s> i updated the drivers to the 81.89 ones, which are not the whql certified or whatever.  </s>
<s> consequently, the next day i recived a nasty bsod, in which windows kindly told me it was my driver.  </s>
<s> i uninstalled it, tried to rollback, got drivers from 2001 driver cd; nothing. the bsod's are gone, but the computer will not or cannot go to a higher resolution and produce 32bit colors.  </s>
<s> does anyone know where i might find the older drivers from nvidia, or an archive of them.  </s>
<s> i admit that i should have cancelled the installtion, but i didn't thinking it would be ok. sadly, i cannot restore the computer, either.  </s>
<s> if anyone knows where to get old drivers, it be a great help.  </s>

<s> you can find the archives on the left hand side of the above page.  </s>
<s> just click on windows xp/2000 archives to get to the old drivers.  </s>
<s> thanks alot, i can finally see what color my desktop is, lol.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
