(it's ati's stupid &quot;if the gpu gets stuck in an endless loop it gets turned off&quot; program, but instead it just terminates the card randomly (in catalyst 4.7 it did, idk about the current version) other options would be: larger fan/faster fan better case cooling the ati silencer also is your psu capable of handeling the gfx card? 350w or more with a good +12v rail?
