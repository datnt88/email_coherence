<s> i only come to these forums once in a blue-moon when i need some real help from you wonderfully tech savvy ladies and gents.  </s>
<s> basically, the age old question, can you recommend me a great wireless router?  </s>
<s> been surfing around cnet trying to get some professional opinions, (looks like the belkin n+ is my best bet), but i just wanted to double and triple check.  </s>
<s> basically i need a very fast and very strong router for gaming.  </s>
<s> i want 0 lag, and 0 kick-off (or as close as i can get).  </s>
<s> &quot;well why don't you just go wired?  </s>
<s> stupid.&quot;,  </s>
<s> i know, but i have a lot of pets and i'm trying to minimize my wire usage around the house, not to mention it's much more aesthetically pleasing.  </s>
<s> money is no issue, i just need something with a fast and solid connection.  </s>
<s> basically only gaming consoles (ps3, 360) will be hooked up to it wirelessly (not more than 2 feet away), aside from a laptop in the basement.  </s>
<s> however, there will be two computers aside from that hooked up wired.  </s>
<s> just need some outside opinions or research before i make the plunge.  </s>
<s> like i said, i've been looking into them and the belkin n+ seems like my best bet, but i'm not 100% it's great reviews are put through their paces in a gaming setting.  </s>
<s> any other suggestions?  </s>
<s> links to reviews i could check out?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> oh, by the way, i'm aware the things i'm connecting to are only wireless g, but i intend on buying a computer or two in the future with wireless n connectivity, so i figured i might as well get a router now to utilize that rather than upgrade later.  </s>
<s> if there is one thing i've learned, gamers don't like wifi.  </s>
<s> get wired.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> any one have any actual recommendations?  </s>
<s> get one you can install openwrt or similar on.  </s>
<s> i've found this to make a bad router good and a good router better.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> alright thanks, i'll keep an eye on that.  </s>
<s> what's your opinion on the belkin n+ i mentioned?  </s>
<s> i know it got top honours here on cnet, but i just wanted to be sure it is, in fact, the best wireless router out there when money is no concern.  </s>
<s> we have some fine discussions about n and how it didn't deliver the goods for some.  </s>
<s> in fact if you can't keep all the gear from one maker you often find yourself disabling &quot;n&quot; and sticking to &quot;g&quot;.  </s>
