<s> help!!. when staring up, my machine will show that the mouse keyboard, hard drive ect.  </s>
<s> has been installed.  </s>
<s> then the windows 98 screen is displayed.  </s>
<s> in a few seconds the initial screen reappears indicating the mouse, keyboard, etc has been installed.  </s>
<s> the windows 98 screen appears again and the cycle continues.  </s>
<s> it never gets to the point of displaying my desktop.  </s>
<s> what is wrong?  </s>
<s> what can i do to get this thing to work?  </s>
<s> have you tried re-installing windows?  </s>
<s> (you can do that in dos or safe mode).  </s>
<s> also, if you have installed a program or a virus has got on to your computer that could be causing it not to boot.  </s>
<s> go into safe mode (hold down f8 or ctrl when you turn your computer on) and remove any programes you have recently installed and run a virus scan.  </s>
<s> hope this helps, joshhendo.  </s>
