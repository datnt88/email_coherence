<s> hi, there's a serious problem with my pc and i'm certain that it's a hardware problem.  </s>
<s> computer has been acting weird for a while - i've been getting a blue screen of death once in a while when booting. now it's completely dying on me!  </s>
<s> bios won't detect my secondary hard drive & neither one of the cd-rom drives that i have.  </s>
<s> i checked the hard drive on my friend's computer - the hard drive is fine.. i checked all the jumpers, wiring, and settings - everything is fine [even replaced the cables]!  </s>
<s> now, i can't tell what the problem is here.. i have two guesses - my power supply [it's fan doesn't sound too good] or could be the motherboard [which i haven't had any problems with for two years now].. any suggestions/ideas?  </s>
<s> i have an mri ata133 motherboard with athlon xp 2100+ on winxp.. please help!!!  </s>
<s> you might also want to try scanning for viruses, spyware, etc., while the drive is in your friend's computer.  </s>
<s> ...hooked up to your friend's computer, you might want to backup your important files in case you need to reinstall windows.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't hestitate to offer that you replace the power supply(psu).  </s>
<s> it will cause flaky operation and effect everything and appears its this or that.  </s>
<s> replacement is just good insurance even if not the problem and make it a good namebrand and higher wattage psu.  </s>
<s> if it was the psu and been acting up for awhile, other componets can take a nose dive or start to fail.  </s>
<s> thus, secondary problems occur and that can be any device/componet.  </s>
<s> remove the cd drives power connections and note that on the bios(not present).  </s>
<s> does it seem the system starts to settle down?  </s>
<s> if yes, replace psu.  </s>
<s> you can further check the ram as they can also mimick similar problems, but usually you can't fix them, replace only.  </s>
<s> they are very, very, very dependant on good stable power.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
