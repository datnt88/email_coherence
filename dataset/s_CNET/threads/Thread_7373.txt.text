i have a usb 2.5&quot; extrnal case with a 120g notebook hard disk, and powered from the usb port. intended for notebooks/laptops, are these external hds suitable for use with a desktop ? they seem to work well. there are 3.5&quot; models intended for the desktop and these are powered off the wall socket. i suppose these can be used for notebooks/laptops as well. these external cases seems interchangeable for laptop and desktop. since both are being produced and sold, should a 2.5&quot; case only be used for laptops and 3.5&quot; for desktops only ? what are the pros and cons of using these external drives for desktops and laptops, apart from size and power source (portability) ? are there any other considerations, e.g. safety (data loss, heat/fire, ) for chosing one over the other ? thanks. christy
but as to data safety the one thing is it's a hard disk. it's not permanent storage but a fine copy. you'll see many posts here about lost data and the recurring lesson about backup. bob
the external drive (2.5&quot; case) draws its power from the usb port. if your laptop is very low on battery power, there may be a problem during data transfer (loss of data), unless you are using a &quot;powered usb hub&quot;, or you are using power off a wall socket.
