the laptop connects to the router but is showing limited access. anyone know how to fix this? i am not advanced in this type of problem so if anyone can help me out thanks!
i assume you are using wireless -- if so it's probably a reception problem. try changing channels -- especially if you can detect neighbouring wifi (then choose a channel 5 stops away from strongest). try raising the router above furniture level and try swivelling the antenna.
you have considered whether the router has wireless security enabled and tried applying the correct security type and passphrase to your computer's wireless user interface ?
