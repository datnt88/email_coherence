i'm looking into the 13 inch retina mbp (8gb ram) and the 15 inch retina mbp (16gb ram). the most i may do is run windows 7 on a virtual machine, and skype. size doesn't matter. i'm aware of the price difference. are they still having that screen problem? can you please give me some advice on which to choose. thank you.
if all you are going to do is run windows 7 and skype, then why not buy a windows machine? just asking p
&quot;that screen problem&quot; that's pretty old news and apple has been replacing them when found. since this is such old news i wonder if this will come up for years to come? bob
