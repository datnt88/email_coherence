hi i am a bit confused with whats going on with my router signal. i previously had a linksys wrt54g, before i upgraded to my new router i was getting quite good signals and my internet speed on my pc was ranging from 3.7 - 4.5 mbps. after upgrading to a cisco linksys e4200 based on the great cnet ratings, my internet speed has plumetted to a range of 2.5 - 3.1 mbps and the signal strength on my wireless connection has gone to &quot;very low&quot; i have checked the channels of the surrounding routers (using a software called network stumbler ). i am using channel 1 which is not being used by anyone else. i am just surprised, i thought my speed and connection strength would sky rocket after getting such a good router. anyone got any idea what i may be doing wrong?
i don't see enough detail to dig into it. it could be out of date firmware or some combination of mac filtering and hiding the ssid but those details are not here. try telling more and be sure to try it the simple way with current firmware, ssid broadcasting, router defaults and wpa2 aes personal security. bob
if this has 802.11n enabled, try channel 3. just in case. however here i let my router pick the channel. it saves me from checking into this setting ever again. call me lazy, i don't like to fiddle with the router. bob
hi r.proffitt thanks for the reply please find further details below: current firmware: 1.0.04 this is up to datemac filtering: disabled ssid broadcasting: enabled security mode : wpa2/wpa mixed mode channel: auto, (network stumbler software shows channel 1 was used) ipv6 spi firewall protection:enabled ipv4 spi firewall protection: enabled
1. just wpa2. 2. without the firewall. nat is a firewall since there will be no inbound connections that can make it to your machine unsolicited. it can cause slowdowns in some routers. some folk dig in their heels on item 2. it's understandable but then again, nat is a firewall too. bob
1. i have removed the firewall 2. i have not changes the wpa2/wpa to just wpa2 because one of my wireless cards doesnn't connect if it's just wpa2. 3. i have moved a small obsturction out of the routers way. i am now getting a bit better internet speed. just as a comparison, if i am sitting next to the router the speed of the internet is above 20mbps, but in a room upstairs (router is downstairs) i am now getting about 3.5 mbps, so ideally i would like to get up to atleast 10 mbps is the upstairs room.
wpa only? there's no reason to use wpa2 if this is in mixed mode. also, how about a channel check? what channel is this on? bob
thanks for that bob much better now signal strength good internet speed 4mbps-5mbps settings changed: 1. wpa only instead of wpa2/wpa 2. channel 3 instead of default 1
for the channel, if you are sure the region is set properly, then automatic is fine. read  to see where the region matters. on a personal comment, i hope these makers start offering some reduced options where they offer the things that have issues in some expert menus. bob
