hello, i just removed a very full internal hard drive (seagate ide) and replaced it with a new 160gb (western digital) hard drive. i thought it would be a simple swap, just needing to change jumpers as i was slaving the old drive. however, none of the drives are booting up i am getting a clicking sound from both drives. what went wrong we simply unplugged and followed the directions that came with the new drive? windows xp o/s.
1. these computers have the os installed to those hard drives and a new drive would do nothing. your post does not reveal how you prepared the hdd for booting. 2. the car analogy. some folk think you can change a hdd like you do a car tire. sorry no. it's much more complicated. bob
disconnect he new one, visit the seagate.com site and get the diagrams so you can set the new one to a slave. also download the seagate utility to clone drives then set the new one as master, the oldie as slave and reboot from the seagate utlity cd/dvd/usb.
wd has a slightly different way to jumper their hd's than other makers. look close at the paper work or visit their site. if you have 80 cond cables you might want to try the cs jumper and the proper plug on the cable.
