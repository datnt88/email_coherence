<s> to avoid the heat and battery problems use a 5400 rpm drive.  </s>
<s> to avoid compatibility problem use the hard drive brand that is currently installed.  </s>
<s> what are you really after here more speed or more hard drive storage?  </s>
<s> choose one or add a second item to your post.  </s>
<s> i clocked my old 4200 boot time at just over 4 minutes on the old 4200 rpm and the clone copy onto a spiffy new 5400 clocked just under 2 minutes.  </s>
<s> but don't expect that to happen from 5400 to 7200.  </s>
<s> also if your laptop has any heat issues, don't go faster...  </s>
