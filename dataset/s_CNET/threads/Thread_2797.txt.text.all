<s> hi i am trying to output to my tv using my laptop. the problem is that i only have vga out on my laptop.  </s>
<s> i wanted a cheap solution so i tried using a vga to svideo cable using this cable on ebay.  </s>
<s> i tried using the standard rca jack and also the svideo jack.  </s>
<s> my laptop does not have many features in the &quot;display&quot; link in the control panel.  </s>
<s> i use the fn + f4 to output to my monitor and have been trying to do it with the cable while it is attached to my tv. however when i do it all that happens is the tv flashes in black and white for a bit and i can barely see the text for about 2 seconds, after that the tv goes blank and my laptop screen stays on.  </s>
<s> i don't know what i am doing wrong any ideas?  </s>
<s> i wanted a cheap solution i have tried doing it with the tv plugged in while booting up the pc as well as plugging it in after the computer has started no difference.  </s>
<s> thing just doesn't look right to me.  </s>
<s> well i bought it a while ago but it was only 5 bucks  </s>
<s> be aware that trying to use a tv as a monitor with the configuration you have is almost always a complete disappointment.  </s>
<s> tv's are very low resolution and only run 640x480 with an extremely grainy image.  </s>
<s> do not expect it to be usable for much even if you spend money getting it working.  </s>
<s> yeah i know.i have 2 other machines that i output to tv with using the svideo out.  </s>
<s> i really like it for watching movies when travelling. this is why i was hoping i could get the cable to work with the laptop with only vga out..... anyway i was trying to avoid spending alot of money on one of those big vga converter boxes.....  </s>
<s> the only to this is to get a extrnial vga to tv conviter they are small plug into the vga port and most give a composit and s-video output.  </s>
<s> they usualy cost around $70. john  </s>
<s> just in case you're still interested / care, that cable you linked to on ebay i've seen before.. they are supplied with the matrox dual head cards which allow specific output to tv on the second vga output.  </s>
<s> now, i'm guessing here, but i think what you're seeing with your laptop is the refresh sent to the telly is waay to high which is why it blinks a couple of times then throws it out.  </s>
<s> so, basically you can't use it.  </s>
<s> unless you have a &quot;dual head&quot; laptop which allows you to specify a secondary monitor ?  </s>
<s> -- xp allows this, but win2k doesn't handle some laptops as well (my tecra 9100 for instance).  </s>
<s> so, if you're on xp, check display settings to see if you can configure a &quot;secondary&quot; display for tv, otherwise its a big bulky vga box.. hth.  </s>
