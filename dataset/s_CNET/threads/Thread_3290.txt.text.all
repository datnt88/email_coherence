<s> hello, i just bought a belkin wireless router with adsl modem and a usb network adaptor.  </s>
<s> i have set up the router but for some reason i can only pick up a very weak signal...even though the router is around 15 metres from the computer (router has a range of 1500ft) could it be the usb network adaptor to blame?  </s>
<s> would an internal pci card pick up the signal better?  </s>
<s> also the router is near a cordless phone but the phone operates at 1.9ghz and the router at 2.4ghz so this should not be much of a problem should it?  </s>
<s> please help.  </s>
<s> usb anything for a network.  </s>
<s> i don't care what the claims are.  </s>
<s> usb limits you, and nics were designed for networks.  </s>
<s> don't know if that's the problem, but it would be the first thing i replaced with an internal nic.  </s>
<s> besides, who needs one more &quot;something&quot; to plug into the pc when it could go inside?  </s>
<s> good luck, click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software.  </s>
<s> suppose you were an idiot. .  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> and suppose you were a member of congress.  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> but i repeat myself.  </s>
<s> --mark twain  </s>
<s> i thought it was strange how the signal was very weak...i will use an internal card.  </s>
<s> one more question....would the cordless phone make a difference to signal strength?  </s>
<s> they do operate at different frequencies but their very close in wavelenghth.  </s>
<s> i've also set up 64bit wep security on this network...is this enough for day-to day internet browsing?  </s>
<s> also i have uninstalled zonealarm as belkin said i dont need it.  </s>
<s> apparently the router has a built in firewall.  </s>
<s> i ran symantec security check and it seem to be true....what is everyones opinion on this?  </s>
<s> am i secure from hackers or data theives?  </s>
<s> any info greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> the wep is cracked far too quickly.  </s>
<s> add the mac filtering and you've knocked out the driveby connecters.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> if i was to add mac address filtering would this make my network secure with 64 bit encryption? is it enough.  </s>
<s> also going back to the cordless phone question is it recomendable to have the router so close to the phone?  </s>
<s> the addage is &quot;any code devised by... can be cracked by...&quot; as to the phone, i didn't respond to that issue.  </s>
<s> there was not enough info for me to comment.  </s>
<s> in short, if it's a 2.4ghz phone, i'd move the router closer to the client machines.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i think its a 1.9ghz phone........it might be ok..il give it a go.  </s>
<s> also how would i network these two computers together so that i can transfer files from desktop to laptop?  </s>
<s> my desktop is running xp home and laptop is on 98 se.....many thanks  </s>
