you didn't say what kind of computer you have so can't give anything specfic. here is a link that maybe helpfull. john
go buy the book &quot;pc's for dummies&quot;. that was the 1st book on computing i bought some years ago, and even that old version is still current, although it has been updated almost every year. check the usual stores that handle computers and they should have several types of those &quot;(fill in blank) for dummies&quot; covering several topics on computers.
