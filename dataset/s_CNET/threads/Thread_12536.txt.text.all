<s> 2002 hp media center pc. upgraded to xp sp2 in nov.  </s>
<s> don't know if related, but no tv signal in media center.  </s>
<s> all other feature in media center are fine.  </s>
<s> system actually reboots when i click around.  </s>
<s> ms/hp sites give no information.  </s>
<s> when xp sp2 upgraded, color changed from green color scheme to blue.  </s>
<s> some additional features now show up.  </s>
<s> but, w/out tv - no record feature & thats primary reason for purchase.  </s>
<s> advice?  </s>
<s> heard of this? could something else be the cause?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> there was a driver update that you needed to download before you downloaded sp2.  </s>
<s> if you missed the driver, that is bad news.  </s>
<s> check the hp site for more fyi.  </s>
<s> is there a way to link the file i need to update... i can do a system restore prior to sp2... i just need to know what to update... is it a windows update or a hp update???  </s>
