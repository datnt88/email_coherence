my old monitor is crackling very loud at regular intervals, almost like a gun, and switches itself on and off. i decreased the brightness. i cannot read so well now, but it seems to be better. is there anything else i can do? is it dangerous? thanks, bo
dangerous? yep. high voltage transformer is around 40,000 volts. build a fire? maybe. replace it.
many shops are closed right now.... i think i will have to wait at least until thursday.... hopefully i will find a shop then. i will switch it off as soon as it heats up though. bo
