what do i delete in the registry to move a drive from one chipset to another? i remember an old computer shopper magazine had the answer to this, but i am unable to find/remember what that was tia
it's far from that easy. and varies with the os in question. here's one about moving xp -&gt;  covers most of the issues, including the oem warning. bob
yes, it was that easy. i know, because i did this before. there was a certain folder in the registry that you deleted, then when you re-installed the hd it picked up everything again, the controllers, the video, the nic, the hd ... you get the idea. similar to the roll-back feature, but not exactly. the machine is a 815e chipset and i need it to go into a system with a 440bx chipset.
the intel chipsets of that age are almost &quot;native&quot; to xp. i don't expect you to see any issues. to really feel the issue, just try this from some via chipset to some of the newer sis or nvidia chipsets. truly not for the timid. bob
i am using w2kpro not xp it will go through the startup bar then hang. thank you for your replies so far bob
i'm unsure why this article can only be found in the cache. bob
i would guess you are speaking of windows 98 (and maybe backward) of what's called the enum which was created during the hardware detection process. this is not valid with xp. sorry.
i don't mean it doesn't exist...it does but isn't how you do things with xp and the way it tracks hardware changes.
