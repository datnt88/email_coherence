13508	5	48583	578611	578601	r. proffitt	12/1/04 5:11 am	1.10187786e12	i was not a good researcher on this one. sorry.	there are replacement coolers out there for some of the geforce cards. my mind didn't think to look beyond the sources i use to solve this issue. for the people i deal with will not part with the money for a tennmax cooler so i just use generic fans. however i always get a ball bearing fan if i think the card/system will need to be used for more than a few months. hint: exacto blade knives, tin snips, plastic nuts, bolts and even plastic cable ties all make for great source material and tools to fashion a new fan mount. sometimes i have to take up space that blocks the adjacent pci slot, but what other choice do we have? at least at this price... bob
