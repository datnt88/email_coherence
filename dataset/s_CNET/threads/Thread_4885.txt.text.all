<s> hello, i currently have an asus u81a, running vista 64bit, and the hard drive just went bad. the best price i can get on the repair is $250 which is about half of what i paid for the laptop 2 years ago.  </s>
<s> i have loved this thing, but dont love vista.  </s>
<s> so my should i just buy a new computer or fix this one?  </s>
<s> and if i go for a new one what would be a good idea? it has a 320gb hard drive and 4gb ram, with a intell core 2 duo.  </s>
<s> i am a college student going into my last year, and this things computing power has been more than enough since i don't play a lot of games.  </s>
<s> you can buy a new laptop, if you wish, it maybe good since you'll be getting the latest out there and be running win7.  </s>
<s> however, if your laptop is only the hd that is bad.  </s>
<s> and!  </s>
<s> you have the recovery/restore discs, then get a new hd, a 250gb is round $60 or so and reloading the os, etc. should be a snap.  </s>
<s> you can try to recover data from old hd using an ext.  </s>
<s> usb case that accepts your old hd. the cost for a hd replacement and such is far cheaper.  </s>
<s> if you need the recovery/restore discs, then try ther vendor support, most sell them for very low cost and/or 3rd party vendors that offer oem type restore/recovery discs.  </s>
<s> again, all this is cheaper than buying new.  </s>
<s> up to you.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> four out of six at are under 50 bucks.  </s>
<s> why don't you get one of those and save 200 bucks?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
