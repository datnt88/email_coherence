the hp seems to have a better processor and much larger hard drive. i plan on playing some games such as cod4 and using photoshop cs3. i would also like to have the option to have the tv tuner thing which the hp has and the dell charges extra for. seem like a better buy with the hp but the dell may let me expand more down the road easily. any experience or ideas are appreciated? my components: dell xps 630 black bezel chassis intel core2 q6600 quad-core (8mb l2 cache,2.40ghz,1066fsb) genuine windows vista home premium 3gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 667mhz - 4 dimms 320gb - 7200rpm, sata 3.0gb/s, 16mb cache single drive: 16x cd/dvd burner (dvd+/-rw) w/double layer write capability no monitor nvidia geforce 8800 gt 512mb integrated 7.1 channel audio no speakers (speakers are required to hear audio from your system) dell usb keyboard dell optical usb mouse hp d4999t: components * genuine windows vista home premium with service pack 1 (32-bit) * intel(r) core(tm) 2 quad processor q9300 * 3gb ddr2-800mhz dual channel sdram (2x1024,2x512) * 512mb nvidia geforce 8600gt, tv-out, dvi-i, hdmi * 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless lan card * free upgrade to 750gb 7200 rpm sata 3gb/s hard drive from 500gb * lightscribe 16x max. dvd+/-r/rw supermulti drive * 15-in-1 memory card reader, 3 usb, 1394, video * atsc-ntsc tv tuner with pvr, fm tuner, remote * sound blaster x-fi xtreme audio * norton internet security(tm) 2008 - 15 months * microsoft(r) works 9.0 * hp keyboard and hp optical mouse
forgot to add that the hp with this config. is $1,289.99 dell is $1,299.99
the hp has a faster and cooler runnign processor, a faster hard drive with more than twice the capacity, a better sound card, built-in hdtv tuner and record, but a weaker video card. the 8600gt can struggle in games unless you're willing to turn down the resolution and the effects/detail level. to make the hp a good gamer, you'd need to upgrade to at least a 9600gt and replace its 350w power supply with a 450+w unit. palit 9600gt, $150 before $30 rebate:  ocz stealth 500w, $60 before $20 rebate:
which means sli compatibility. the psu has more leeway as well. it is the better gaming pc, especially if you think a couple of years ahead. you'll be able to drop a price-dropped faster 1333mhz fsb chip in there, and also slap in a second 8800gt (or a single power-hungry card) in there to keep your gaming current. as far as the gaming experience right now is concerned, the q6600+8800gt combo will also slay a q9300+8600gt.
