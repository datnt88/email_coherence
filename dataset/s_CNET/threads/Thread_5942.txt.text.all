<s> i have had a mac book for about a year now.  </s>
<s> my husband and i are expecting a little girl in about 2 weeks and are looking to purchase our first camcorder.  </s>
<s> i know that with a mac and wanting to use imovie and idvd you cant just go out and get any ole camera i am not really computer savvy and we are really just looking for something to capture the birth and special moments nothing professional.  </s>
<s> don't get me wrong i want the best quality that i can get... just cant pay an arm and a leg.  </s>
<s> i really want something user friendly that is very compatible with imovie and idvd where i can just plug it in and it works... you know i dont want to have to do anything complicated to make it work!! i have been researching and it is so confusing b/c the list that apple gives you apparently does not hold much weight seeing as though there are cameras on there that dont work with macs.  </s>
<s> please help!!!!!!! our price point is under 400$ hope someone can help oh and do you know if being an hd camera, if you have to film in either all sd or all hd to transfer the footage?  </s>
<s> and what is the point in having a hd camera if after u transfer the footage and edit it then burn it to a dvd and it will be in sd. this is all so confusing for me  </s>
<s> at you will find a whole section of reviews about this very subject.  </s>
<s> i do know that the sony video cameras, the ones with a hard drive, will work with imovie09 avoid any camera that records directly onto a dvd mini disk.  </s>
<s> two reasons; 1. it is virtually impossible to edit the video as it must be converted from dvd format back to something that can be edited.  </s>
<s> 2. you cannot play the mini disk in your computer if it has a slot loading dvd drive, most new apple machines do.  </s>
<s> good luck p  </s>
<s> this camera is in your price range.  </s>
<s> check it out here: p  </s>
