need help, just installed a geforce 4200 agp on a msi 64 bit motherboard running a amd 3000+ with 512 megs of ram on win xp pro..i have loaded the latest video drivers and the correct motherboard drivers also.when i try to play sof the background is blocky and no images show up at all.i have tryed another card and get the same results,i also have tryed several other driver versions and still get the same thing.could this be a motherboard issue??
what other cards did u try? could be some driver settings or some sort of device conflict. did u build dis computer? i wouldnt have gotten new stuff such as new processor, mobo, ram, new os, and stuff without getting a new gfx card. what mobo it is would be good. and any more info u can provide. whaat does blocky mean?
you said you tried 2 vid cards, so have you tried reinstalling the game?
