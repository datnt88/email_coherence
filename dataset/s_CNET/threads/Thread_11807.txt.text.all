<s> brought a second hand desktop just last week.  </s>
<s> a compaq deskpro with a piii 800mhz processor and running windows xp home.  </s>
<s> everything was going great until the keyboard and mouse started behaving stupidly.  </s>
<s> the keyboard wouldn't work with the mouse plugged in.  </s>
<s> i changed keyboards, and it now works.  </s>
<s> however, the mouse is still behaving erratically.  </s>
<s> when i boot, everything works fine, then the mouse will freeze a couple of times, then start, and then stop working all together.  </s>
<s> it's very annoying, to say the least. the only temporary fix is to restart windows, but i cant do that every time to mouse freezes as it usually does it less than two minutes into running.  </s>
<s> any help would be wonderful.  </s>
<s> 1. did you remove the case and dust it out, clean off the heatsinks, check the fans?  </s>
<s> 2. how are you handling spyware?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i havent cleaned the case out - will do first thing.  </s>
<s> spyware - pc hasn't been hooked up to network yet, so no internet = no spyware - the hard drive i formatted as soon as i got it.  </s>
<s> btw the lights on the keyboard + mouse come on, then says error 301 keyboard not plaugged in or something like that before even hit's windows at boot - mouse stopped working altogether under windows, though laser is on and mouse works ith other machines.  </s>
<s> what should i clean it with?  </s>
<s> ok, so i opened it up and cleaned all the dust out of it - amazing amount by the way, especially in the heatsink for the cpu.  </s>
<s> turned it on, said my prayers and - the keyboard didn't work, the machine wouldn't boot to windows - am lloking at getting a usb keyboard/mouse now.  </s>
