<s> i know most of my family thinks im the big tech guy, so i feel extremely dumb asking this question.  </s>
<s> i have this 2 or 3 year old dell that has 256mb of ddr 2100.i want to upgrade to 512mb .  </s>
<s> ddr 2100 is hard to find and in some cases the new ddr 3200 is cheaper.  </s>
<s> would 512mb of ddr 3200 work fine in my pc? or is ddr 2100 the only solution i have?  </s>
<s> i know for a fact some one told me i wont experience any better bandwidth but he was not totally sure if it would work thats why im asking before i buy.  </s>
<s> thanx and happy holidays  </s>
<s> so i was looking and ther is a good deal for a stick of 512mb of ddr 2700. is it ok?  </s>
<s> pc3200 would be backwards compatible.  </s>
<s> a check on dells site might give a clue.  </s>
<s> take a trip here and plug your machine type into their memory finder.  </s>
<s> it will tell you what type/speed memory your machine needs and what it is going to cost.  </s>
<s> in theory you can mix an match speeds but if the cost is only a few bucks then i would just get the proper one.  </s>
<s> lower priced?? then when he upgrades to the next computer he can use it in that one.  </s>
<s> he seems to know that it won't run at the higher speed, so buy the lower price.  </s>
<s> buy from a vendor that provides return and life warranty.  </s>
<s> most do.  </s>
<s> obvioulsy don't get ecc or registerd if the present isn't.  </s>
<s> if the board will only take 2100, so be it.  </s>
<s> if the board will accept 2700 or 3200 but only run at 2100, that means he has faster memory for a future board.  </s>
<s> i was upgrading my hardware slowly and went this route.  </s>
<s> new board runs faster memory the old mobo was running at 266.  </s>
<s> chuck  </s>
<s> most of todays memory is backwards compatible, so the 3200 would read the 2100 bus speed.  </s>
<s> save a little more and use the 2700.  </s>
<s> you'll never notice the difference.  </s>
<s> thanks i ordered the 512 at 3200.  </s>
<s> my friend has the smae mobo and sid it works but at 2100.  </s>
<s> im plaing to upgrade later so its a good deal.  </s>
