why must they put pci-e x1 and x4 slots on motherboards? what can they be used for in the first place? what can you put in them?
for personal computers, mostly they are for future use. off the top of my head: x1 = video cards; network adapters; hdd/raid controllers; usb, firewire and serial cards. x4, x8 = hdd/raid controllers. i just googled for pci express sound cards and tv tuners and came up with a few hits. hmm...i didn't know about those!
2 years from now, regular pci slots will be vestigal since all new components will use the pci-e slot. x16 is only needed for high-bandwidth components (like videocards). x4 and x1 are intended for stuff like disk controllers, low-end video cards, co-processors (such as a physics card), etc.
would it make sense to purchase a video card for pci express x1 or just get a pci graphics card. my mobo has neither agp or pci express x16.
