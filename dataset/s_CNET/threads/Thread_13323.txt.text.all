<s> i have an old motherboard its has three traditional pci slots i have ordered a 8400gs( my budget aint high) it does not have any pci x16 slots, but through videos and other images i got to see that the card goes in x16 slot.  </s>
<s> wat shud i do, can i put the card in the pci slots that have been provided or i wud have to buy a new motherboard  </s>
<s> sorry, but pci-e x16 doesn't fit in a pci-slot.  </s>
<s> so you need to buy either another video card (the 8400 is cheap because it isn't so good) or another motherboard.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> i'm not sure of your skill...but you should have a brown 3&quot; slot next to the pci slots.that's a respectable card in agp form(im on a 7600gs 512,lol),but if you have the pci-x model,definitely get a new board.pc  </s>
<s> hardware is getting real cheap.  </s>
<s> you can get a decent board for 50 bucks or less...problem is,you'll need new ram (cheapest is $50 for 4 gigs),and a new cpu,...at least.  </s>
