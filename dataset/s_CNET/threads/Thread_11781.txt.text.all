<s> there is no solution for you.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> it appears your flash drive isn't supported by the 'school system' as it wasn't installed on it. it just isn't generic enough to be accepted, though i'm sure a plain flash drive is.  </s>
<s> see, if the school will allow an install so you can proceed, if not see what products are supported.  </s>
<s> it may mean the school system needs to be updated as a possible another source of the problem.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> my teacher said that they don't have much more rights then we do, and we tried it with the teacher and it did the same thing.  </s>
<s> ='[. is there any alterations that i could make to the flash drive and not the computer?  </s>
<s> i can run programs just not install them.  </s>
<s> also* generic flash drives do work on these, but this is 10x more not likely to be stolen if i leave it in my computer class.  </s>
