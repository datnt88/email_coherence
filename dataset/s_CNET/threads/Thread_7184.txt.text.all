<s> hi i wanted to knw, should i buy a pentium d 945 or should i wait till e6300 prices go down, and is there huge difference in gaming and multitasking using c2d e6300 and p-d 945, and sorry i think i had too many post of this topics, because i dnt need to spend too much of money in a wrong thing, so i need a normal cpu not a xtraordinary cpu.  </s>
<s> i have 1gb ram, 40gb hdd, and i will buy a normal mobo , it may be a gigabyte mobo  </s>
<s> so get the e6300.  </s>
<s> 945d, $168: e6300, $185: e6400, $221:  </s>
<s> i am in dubai and here the pentium d 945 are for 625dhs and ------------------- c2d e6300 are for 900dhs 300dhs are too much and i dnt have tht much money:(...so wat shld i do i am stuck btw 2 probs  </s>
<s> consumes quite a bit more power, thus more of a possibility for a heat problem.  </s>
<s> thus get a reasonaby large case with an additional fan or two added, as well as a little higher wattage power suppy.  </s>
<s> it does seem funny that the older cpu may require more power but tis true.  </s>
<s> what kind of ram do you have ddr or ddr2 if ddr what about a amd 939 cpu and motherboard there cheap and good gaming cpu here in usa and can use ddr memory if you already have ddr core2 duo is a better cpu but uses ddr2 memory you can search google for reviews of the cpu and motherboard you can get in your country to see what there capable of ?  </s>
<s> good luck  </s>
<s> ya i m thinkin of buyin c2d e6300, bcuz i hav heard many complains of pentium d 945 abt heat and is not even nice than lowest model of c2d product.  </s>
<s> cant we take ddr, and is ddr2 costly than ddr, and wats the difference btw ddr2 and ddr  </s>
