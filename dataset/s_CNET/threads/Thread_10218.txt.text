guys. im a new member. i would like to ask for help from you guys. we hav this research about advance networking, the topic is about network standards and i dont know how to start our research. can you give me some sites, infos and hints?, thnx. here is the my research to do: network standard discuss and differentiate the network standards available such as open
found relevant articles. i'd start there. bob
i've tried searching about the topic in google.com but im confused. different topics are coming out from the search. most of the times, articles about the networking standard organization are the ones being displayed as the result of the search. i cant understand exactly what network standards should i search for.
this may be the purpose of your class and assignment. to jump in and start reading and eventually piece together the puzzle. since you didn't ask for anything specific i can't answer. if you want a fine book on networking there are many out there. bob
all i want to ask is: if you know any standards commonly used for networking. like the iso/osi referrence model. if you know any other networking standards, can you please share them to me, thanks.
the nice thing about standards is that the ones you noted are documented widely and fine books at the better book stores. however there are those that think if they can ask the right person it all could be explained in two paragraphs. sorry, this may never happen. just look at what results you get at google and the wikipedia. so far you haven't asked for something that isn't out there on the web or in a fine book. it's all there for you to keep reading till it makes sense. bob
