<s> i'm on a budget here of about $800 and i need a computer that can run world of warcraft at top settings with ease (which isn't a whole lot of power).  </s>
<s> i know i need a core 2 duo processor, a 500:1 contrast ratio monitor, and 2-3 gigs of ram.  </s>
<s> i need to know about graphics cards and such.  </s>
<s> also, if you know any nice computer accessories (mouse, keyboard, etc.) that improve gaming experience let me know ;d. thank you for your posts.  </s>
<s> get your core 2 duo, etc and pick a card from this list -&gt; it's that simple.  </s>
<s> well i know about the core 2 duo and the nvidia geforce is probly what i need but i decided to build my own computer so i can custom pick my components so i dont get ripped for a bunch of useless propritary parts instead i get lots of good generic ones =d  </s>
<s> you didn't detail what part of the world you are in so if i start giving links to stores in aus then what good is that?  </s>
<s> let's break it down. the simplest c2d with 2gb ram and cards off that list over 100 bucks do very well at gaming today.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> and sells for much less  </s>
