11742	3	533594	5166529	5165241	ramarc	7/13/11 7:05 pm	1.3105839e12	that card has 2 pci-e connectors	so the sli-ready is probably fine since 12w will come off the pci-e board connection and the other two connectors only need lesss than 20w each. a single rail high voltage psu will feed power to both pci-e connectors from the single rail, but others will feed it from two rails. if you're still worried, this sli certified one will definitely fit the bill for $90 since each 12v rail is rated at 25w:
