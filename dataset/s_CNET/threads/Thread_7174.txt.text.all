<s> i have just installed a 400 ghd to be used strictly for backup.  </s>
<s> my computer sees the hd, but when i try to utilize it for a backup, i kept getting the message, &quot;unreadable&quot;.  </s>
<s> i went ahead and formatted it, (ntfs) and tried again.  </s>
<s> it will try to do the backup and then stops with a message that backup failed.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> thanks, bill  </s>
<s> you might want to supply this information.  </s>
<s> as well, you could test the ability to access the drive by manually copying some of your data from your primary drive to the new one.  </s>
<s> steve, thanks so much.  </s>
<s> i thought that i would &quot;play&quot; with the backup, (win) this morning and everything worked like a charm.  </s>
<s> again, thanks, bill  </s>
