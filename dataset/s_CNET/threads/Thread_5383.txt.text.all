<s> the laptop has the following connections: vga, hdmi, displayport, usb(3 ports).  </s>
<s> my question: for a photographer who values the importance of color accuracy, what would be the recommended monitor-to-laptop connection, that would result in the best quality output to the monitor with no degradation to the image.  </s>
<s> would it be hdmi to hdmi?  </s>
<s> dvi to usb? or something else?  </s>
<s> i am currently using vga to vga but not sure if that is good for me?  </s>
