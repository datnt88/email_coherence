<s> i recently bought a hauppauge 1178 wintv-hvr-1600 ( [l= [/l] ) and opened it to then find out it only supports hd from over the air broadcasts (atsc.) i'm looking for a tv tuner that can watch and record in hd from my comcast cable box.  </s>
<s> i have hd comcast cable box, and i want to be able to watch and record from that source on my computer, as i do not have a hd tv, and my computer is all i have that is capable of playing hd. (1900*1200 res) are there any tv tuner cards that i can put in my pc that will let me do this?  </s>
<s> think about it.  </s>
<s> if you could receive hd/digital broadcasts (cable or satellite) on your pc, could you not therefore save the digital movie and therefore burn that digital movie?  </s>
<s> what might an unscrupulous person do with that dvd?  </s>

<s> my mini-schnauzer is smarter than your honor student.  </s>
<s> the hvr1600 has a qam tuner which will let you see/record the non-encrypted (in-the-clear) hd channels on your cable system.  </s>
<s> it must be connected to your cable (not the cable box) and it won't record premium channels.  </s>
<s> call comcast to determine if your cable system has clear qam hd channels.  </s>
<s> eh, you can record normal cable tv, and burn a dvd of a movie on tv if you want.... it's being broadcast on tv... are you saying that with hdtv, companies are not allowing people to record hdtv shows?  </s>
<s> but it's of lower quality.  </s>
<s> but recording the digital signal and burning that signal would rival a dvd quality movie.  </s>
<s> that could be construed as piracy.  </s>
<s> hdtv can be recorded on a dvr or such.  </s>
<s> but the encryption is limited to the recorder.  </s>
<s> recording hdtv to a computer is highly discouraged.  </s>
<s> look around if you like.  </s>
<s> i have.  </s>
<s> there are many video cards with hdmi and/or dvi output.  </s>
<s> hdmi or dvi input are nonexistent.  </s>
<s> if you find one, email me.  </s>
<s> you might be interested in a similar topic here: if you look for the stb you have, then you can research the method.  </s>
<s> watching live hd does not seem to be as much of a problem as recording it. the hauppauge hd pvr 1212 is also supposedly capable of recording component outputs but is not a card.  </s>
