i want to know how to format my hard drive in order to use the full 160 gb instead of the 48.8 partition currently being used.
how old is the system ?
well, everything u need is just some partition manager,which can partition disk. as for me, i'm using disk director. it will be able to create new partition, as you wish, you can also choose the new partition file system and resize your present partition in case of need. if you have any precise questions, dont hesitate to ask
of the proudcts including acronis disk director or symantec's (formerly powerquest) partition magic. original poster never responded to question about os and service pack so perhaps the problem has been fixed.
