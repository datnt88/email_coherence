i'm running windows xp and i just bought a wireless g pci network adapter, i have disabled the linksys software and am using windows xp to manage my connections. 
so i was wondering if there was a way to get the linksys software off of my computer and still be able to use the adapter. 
there are no options to close the icon when right clicked, nor is there a menu to block it from . 
i tried uninstalling the software but that uninstalled the hardware as well, is there any other way that i can get this annoying software off my taskbar? 
installing the drivers from the linksys disk without installing their software? 
no, how would i go about doing that? 
would i just explore the cd with explorer and then open the drivers folder? 
you can do that. 
when you install hardware and it asks you if you have a disk, click yes and point it to the .inf 
file.
