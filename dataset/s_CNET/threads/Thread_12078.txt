(i have two hd's and two cd drives). once i had the new cd in i connected everything back and started up. no video. i changed a couple of cables around blindly and i got video. but it ask me if i wanted to boot to safe mode. i thought that it may have been because i had to power down because of the no video thing. i booted to safe mode and it atomatically restarted and ask me the same question again. it did this three times before i gave up. now i have tried what i feel is every possible cable combination. i have even tried not connecting cd drives, a hard drive and still no solution. right now i do not have video again and i can't figure out what is wrong. so i through myself humbly at your mercy.
