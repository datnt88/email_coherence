<s> hi everyone, just want to thank everyone in advance for reading my post.  </s>
<s> i'm considering buying a new hard drive and i have options of a hd with a 8 mb buffer and 16 mb buffer.  </s>
<s> the price difference isn't that large but if the 16 doesn't perform that much better than the 8, i'm gonna get the 8. can someone give me a quick and dirty regarding the differences in performance between these two options?  </s>
<s> if the performance difference is depenedent on components in my computer, please let me know what those dependencies are.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> let's say we have an os with a better disk cache system.  </s>
<s> this renders this drive cache not so big a deal.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> does windows xp have a good file system cache?  </s>
<s> thanks for your help  </s>
<s> xp, windows 2000, linux all have pretty good disk cache systems.  </s>
<s> if i look at my system, it's 283 megabytes of disk cache which the difference of that 2, 8 or 16 mb on the disk drive would not make much difference.  </s>
<s> may have some benchmarks if you want to look further. the rpms seem to be what you can't skimp on.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> last thing i promise =). any idea on how to check how much disk cache i have like you did? and i'm assuming the amount that you have 283, is a pretty good set up to not really need the 16mb cache from the hd. thanks!!!  </s>
<s> look at the system cache entry.  </s>
<s> cheers, bob  </s>
<s> thanks so much for your help.  </s>
<s> i think i'm good with the 8mb buffer hd. take it easy!  </s>
