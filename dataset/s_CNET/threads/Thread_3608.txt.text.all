<s> i would like to be able to control all of the features of my multifunction printer wirelessly.  </s>
<s> in particular, if a fax comes in, i would like the option of it &quot;printing to file.&quot; also, if i have a fax to send, i would like to be able to &quot;print to fax&quot; and also &quot;dial fax&quot; from my laptop.  </s>
<s> in short, i would like to be able to do everything but change paper and ink remotely with full multifunction functionality...from my laptop. is anybody aware of a multifunction printer and/or software that offers this kind of total control?  </s>
<s> thanks a lot, mikey  </s>
<s> &quot;the hp psc 2510 is the only mfp in this roundup with built-in 802.11b wireless support.  </s>
<s> that's in addition to its ethernet connector, which means you can attach it to either a wired or wireless network to print, scan, or access memory cards across a network&quot;  </s>
<s> thanks for the answer, but what about faxing with remote control from my laptop.  </s>
<s> i can't do that for you.  </s>
