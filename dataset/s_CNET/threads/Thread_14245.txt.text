hi all, i'm a self taught (self confessed) computer nerd and have been dabbling in a bit of networking; i recently networked a small internet cafe. been hearing about this ip version 6 and have found loads of papers expalining what it does....... double dutch to me i'm afraid. what i would like to know is this: if i'm buying a switch, do i have to look out for certain criteria so it can handle ipv6? if i want to put in an ip address in windows networking, how can i enter a 128bit ip address? as i understand it there is no more need for a subnetmask, what else is there to know? i've been trying to read some of the papers that are available but havent come across anything that's understandable. thanks for your time jimi
switches don't know about ip addresses.
ty for the quick reply what about routers? and what about other hardware? do i have to pay any attention to it or can i just sit back and wait for it to happen? thanks again
it's a moot point. and if you had a ipv6 network...
