hello everyone! i am having an issue with sharing printers. i have a vista desktop, vista laptop, and xp desktop; the main source being the vista desktop (where the network is established). i run vista home 32-bit on both the laptop and desktop, and the xp is the home edition as well (sp2). the vista laptop can see and share files/printers with the vista desktop, and the xp desktop can see the network from the vista desktop, but cannot see/locate any of the shared printers. i've pinged each desktop ip address to the other desktop; i've made certain all of the workgroups were titled the same; it's not a firewall issue; and i've tried every other option listed on every forum i've come across the last 3 days, and still nothing. i've even attepted to reset the router and start from scratch, with no help there, either. can someone help me, please? if any other system/program information is needed to be supplied, please do not hesitate to ask; i need to get this established and running asap, as i run a business from home. thank you very much! andrea
i can't tell if you installed the lltd. 2. read another discussion underway at  pay attention to post 4. bob
bob - yes, the file and printer sharing are both marked 'on'. this may sound dumb, but what is lltd? i'm still learning how to set all of this up, and that's something i've not come across as of yet. thank you!
noted in our forum sticky and at google.com. sorry but it's a common item so let's do a little research. bob
