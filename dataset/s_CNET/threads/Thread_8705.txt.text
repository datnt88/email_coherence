i bought an lcd monitor with a: dvi-d dual input ..and a vid card with a: dvi-i dual input ..and i have a dvi-i single input ------------ picture for details:  the picture shows the cable in red, the vga and lcd's complementary inputs in green and violet. ------------ now the dvi-i cable won't fit into the lcd's hub, but will fit into the vid card's. the only thing preventing fitting to the lcd is the 4 pins (around the flat pin) you see in the photo. would removing them manually cause any conflicts? because the alternative choice now is to buy a dvi-d cable which has no pins around the flat thing. what do you think? thanks.
you have male-single link while both connectors on the card and lcd are male-dual link. i would buy a new cable.
as far as i know, a single link will also fit into a dual link hub. i know dual links provide higher resolutions, but i'm satisfied with my current 1280x1024.
