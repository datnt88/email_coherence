hey hey, &lt;div&gt;i just want to get quick advise. i have an old computer with the following: &lt;div&gt;gigabyte ga p35 ds3 something like that 2,6 ghz core 2 duo intel xfx geforce 8800 gts 2gb memory &lt;/div&gt; to me it looks like the video card is the slowest part, so i thought i could replace the video card by maybe a gtx 260 or a gtx 460 or something like that. what do you think? ah, my goal is to have a few more fps in games and i don't want to spend the money on a complete new computer. thanks already tobi &lt;/div&gt;
video cards were asked about and the last 2 discussion appear to favor the 460. bob
your 8800,is that a 1gb ,or a 512mb ? ..just curious. i don't know,but i can share some experience. i had a 400mhz,a 1.2mhz,and 2.4mhz pcs on my lan a few yrs ago...all were maxed with ram.i have alot of dated nvdia video cards laying around,so i eperimented.i was curious if a slow machine would benefit from a fast video card.i started with a 32mb in the 400,then 64,128,and finally a 256 (all cards used the same nvidia driver so it was easy.thanks nvidia ! i installed tiger woods 2003 and went to work.i figured anything above a 32 or 64 would be useless overkill on that ancient 400,but i was wrong.the game ran smoother,and smoother untill i reached my 256 ceiling. i still have that 1.2,and just installed lord of the rings on it.the game demands a 1.8 cpu min,yet my 1.2 runs it smooth with a 7600gs (512mb) installed.(even though the 7600 wants a 8x agp slot,and the 1.2 only supports a 4x) experiment results say fast video cards are worth it,in any machine.cpu's are a distant second in comparison.
