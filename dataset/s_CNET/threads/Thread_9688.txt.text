i just picked up a cf-28 toughbook, 800mhz mst xp. i want to hook up a bluetooth gps to use in my truck with my existing mapping software. any reccomendations or experience with a particular card and car mounted receiver?
since it would be surprising that i run your un-named software title i'll have to pass on answering your post. however i will share that if i were to do this i'd look for a waas enabled nmea compatible bluetooth gps. i wonder what &quot;card&quot; you are asking about. i use a variety of 20 or less dollar usb bluetooth dongles in my system. bob
sorry i use fugawi map of america, it uses the usgs topo maps. i had a mouse type setup with my pocketpc but the screen is so small and hard to see.
&quot;garmin (including usb models), magellan, lowrance, silva/brunton multinavigator, and any other with nmea v2 or greater output &quot; i've found nice looking bluetooth waas nmea gps units for under 99 bucks. add another 20 for the usb bluetooth dongle and you're done. just check the gps for nmea v2 . i'll let you research why i think waas is needed. bob
thanks for your help. i know what waas is.
