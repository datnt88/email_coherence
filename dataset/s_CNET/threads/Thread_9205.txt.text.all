<s> i'm going to be going to school for web designe and i was wondering what i should look for in a desktop.  </s>
<s> i only have $1000 to spend and i need a monitor to go with it.  </s>
<s> help!!!!  </s>
<s> a good graphics desktop needs a powerful cpu, something like a sparc.  </s>
<s> there's a reason why cad/cam was run on theses machines for awhile.  </s>
<s> most web design apps don't need a lot of horsepower.  </s>
<s> photoshop is the only app that can overtax an underpowered pc. but that's only when editting large images and, for web use, images are relatively small.  </s>
<s> when shopping for a desktop, get at least 2gb ram, a mid-level dual core cpu (athlon x2 5000+ or core2duo e6550 or higher), a large hard drive, and a large monitor.  </s>
<s> here's a gteway that can handle adobe dreamweaver cs3, ms visual studio, etc. gateway gt5656 athlon x2 6000, 3gb ram, 500gb hd, $616 acer 22&quot; widescreen lcd, $270 these prices are from circuit city, but you can find similar pricing elsewhere.  </s>
