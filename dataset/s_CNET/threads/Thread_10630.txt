(service pack 5 or 6) 64mb system memory. 50mb of available disk space for full installation. cd-rom or dvd-rom drive. i think my pc exceeds all these, but still i have the problem! nd yes, i have the latest drivers installed. my friend tells me to reinstall os, but its a real pain, and not guaranteed to work, btw, there is no problem with other tasks in the pc, just games.
