<s> 1. what's the big difference 'tween the amd athlon and barton chips?  </s>
<s> from what i can gather, the barton's have an extra 256 l2 cache (or something along those lines)- yet, i just read an article that compared them side by side and a lower rated (in ghz) athlon out-performed a higher rated barton.  </s>
<s> 2. what's up with the latest nvidia cards?  </s>
<s> i just saw online for the first time a ti4800- i was only familiar with the ti4200-4600.  </s>
<s> and what about the newer fx 'ultra' series?  </s>
<s> aside from being agp 8x and 'dx 9' ready, is it the gpu clock speed that makes it a 'better' vid card?  </s>
<s> a few months ago i read some articles on these new cards, and overall, reviewers online and in pc mags weren't impressed; i figure by now, bugs are being worked out.  </s>
<s> i'm asking because i'm in an upgrading mood.  </s>
<s> i got a new asus a7vbx-x mobo this summer that supports the athlon and barton chips, and agp 8x. fsb tops out at 400 mhz.  </s>
<s> so, athlon or barton, stay with the ti series, or the newer fx cards?  </s>
<s> i'm not a big time gamer, but i'm finding that my ti4200 lagging a bit when playing something like grand theft auto- strangely, something that didn't happen when i had the ecsk75a motherboard.  </s>
<s> all opinions/info much appreciated.  </s>
<s> tia.  </s>
<s> 1. documented at 2. you'll have to find benchmarks to see if what card you are looking at could perform better.  </s>
<s> see if has benchmarked it.  </s>
<s> as to bugs.  </s>
<s> there are plenty more to be worked out.  </s>
<s> and if you want bug-free, then you don't want a computer.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks for the link to tomshardware; forgot about that as a good resource.  </s>
<s> 'and if you want bug-free, then you don't want a computer'- lol.  </s>
<s> sadly, too true...  </s>
