im looking at buying a amd i see the athlons are more expensive then the semprons but are they that much better? thx
if its only for basic word processing, surfing the net, instant messaging, email, etc. then the sempron will do fine. and it depends...if u get the low end athlon 3000+ or 3200+, there probably wont be much difference between those and the semprons. however when u go higher, there is definitely a difference.
alot of photoshop, how much difference when you go higher then 3000 or 3200
these days, my low end is the amd athlon 64 3500+. price is good. if the budget is not so tight, my preference is a dual core cpu.
if you are going to do gaming and photoshop, then the sempron or low end amd will not help you there. i agree that a dual core cpu is the best way for you to go. if you can't go dual core, i suggest you get an amd 64 3500+ or a 3700+.
