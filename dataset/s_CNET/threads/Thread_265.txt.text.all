<s> can anyone tell me the difference between cpu cores?  </s>
<s> i'm shopping around for a new amd 64 3500+ on newegg and all the products have different cores like newcastle and sledgehammer.  </s>
<s> what is the difference?  </s>
<s> does it make a difference?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> 1. socket 939 please.  </s>
<s> 2. 3. just me talking here.  </s>
<s> if this was me, i'd wait for a dual core athlon 64 soon to appear.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> can you tell me the difference between the dual core amd 64s and the regular 64 939 socket amds?  </s>
<s> also will they be tailored more for the high end users, ie: price?  </s>
<s> when will they be available?  </s>
<s> the dual-core athlon 64 as displayed was on a socket 939 board.  </s>
<s> if you are looking at 64-bit, you are classed as a high end user.  </s>
<s> you'll find that video editing, games and more on windows 2000/xp/linux/other oses will perform better on dual cpus.  </s>
<s> putting two cpus in one socket is cheaper than dual cpu boards.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i understand the processing power will be greater but how about the price range?  </s>
<s> (price maximum of $300) what speeds do they operate at?  </s>
<s> do you know where i can find information on this product?  </s>
<s> also what kind of motherboards will support this dual core?  </s>
<s> another question unrelated to cpus, do you suggest that i buy a pci express motherboard and gcard?  </s>
<s> i'm leaning toward agp 8x because of its value but i'm not sure of the agps longevity.  </s>
<s> early 2005 from what i read.  </s>
<s> remember that dual core athlon 64 was demonstrated on a 939 board.  </s>
<s> if you are not interested in this, then go with what's available now.  </s>
<s> prices will be what they are in the future.  </s>
<s> such have not been published.  </s>
<s> as to agp, that is your choice. it seems odd to entertain athlon 64 socket 939 and not look at what the boards offer.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> asus' a8v deluxe currently supports agp 8x but they are planning to release a pci express capable motherboard in the upcoming months.  </s>
<s> i would like to stay with agp but i am worried about the longevity of this interface since i'm looking to use this comp for college and beyond.  </s>
<s> you have at least 3 or so years till agp vanishes.  </s>
<s> the signs are all around you with newer machines having pci express.  </s>
<s> when you see 1/2 the cards on display are pci express then the change over has begun.  </s>
<s> no machine lasts on the leading edge more than a few months.  </s>
<s> but you know that.  </s>
