<s> i mistakenly removed the 128 ddr ram module from the mercury pvcle266m-l v3.0a motherboard of my system unit while power was still turned on.  </s>
<s> on switching off and replacing the memory module, and turning on my pc, it continously makes three intermediate beeps and will not come up.  </s>
<s> please what can i do?  </s>
<s> now i need help.  </s>
<s> power on self tests will exit with beeps in patterns that are s'posed to tell you what's failed.  </s>
<s> i'm guessing the 3 beep code on your mobo has something to do with fried ram.  </s>
<s> check your manual to find out for sure.  </s>
<s> (if you can't find the manual look for it at mercury-pc.com) if it is bad ram, then figure out which is the bad stick(s) and don't use it/them.  </s>
<s> your system is hosed.  </s>
<s> if you have good ram available not the old one.  </s>
<s> install it and see what happens. the risk is yours.  </s>
<s> if it were me.  </s>
<s> i won't trust this system to be reliable any more, though you can be lucky.  </s>
<s> beware - good ram may fail, if the same ram slot is used and fry every ram stick you install.  </s>
<s> also possible the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> has taken a hit.  </s>
<s> usually 3-beeps suggest some ram problem, but investigate your model# mtrbd.  </s>
<s> and see what the &quot;beep code&quot; refers to.  </s>
<s> beeps can be long and short, so note the beep sequence.  </s>
<s> if you wanted a reason to &quot;upgrade&quot; here you go.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> be sure you have abode reader to review this.  </s>
<s> i already did a quick glance and 3 beeps is ram related, go figure.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> i usually support the idea of keeping ol' systems running if they're getting the tasks done that you need.  </s>
<s> on this one, just a heads-up -- the ddr ram is not going to work for your next computer, as we're transitioning from ddr2 to ddr3.  </s>
<s> so if you have to buy ram to replace the fried stick(s), that investment won't carry on to your next computers in the future.  </s>
