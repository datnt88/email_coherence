<s> i am in the market for a webcam.  </s>
<s> this will be my first.  </s>
<s> basically, i am looking for something simple to use with decent picture quality.  </s>
<s> i only plan to use it for video conversations via msn.  </s>
<s> this little number caught my eye recently on newegg: i gladly welcome any purchasing advice.  </s>
<s> especially in regards to what features i should look for and what would be a good compromise in terms of price and quality.  </s>
<s> many thanks in advance!  </s>
<s> just a suggestion.  </s>
<s> offer the make and model as well so others can see what you were looking at.  </s>
<s> -&gt; a recurring issue with all such work is the lack of good lighting.  </s>
<s> there are few cheap cameras that will overcome bad lighting (i'll write none.) bob  </s>
<s> the link is for the logitech quickcam fusion.  </s>
<s> it got a 7.6/5.7  </s>
<s> from cnet's editors/users and 4 out of 5 eggs from newegg users.  </s>
<s> currently it costs about $80 and has a $40 rebate.  </s>
<s> sorry the link did not work for you.  </s>
<s> for whatever reason it still works for me though.  </s>
<s> i will definitely try to be more courteous when posting links in the future.  </s>
<s> that's a pretty bold statement regarding webcams in bad lighting.  </s>
<s> i will primarily be using the camera at night when lighting is less than optimal since the people i will speak to are literally halfway around the globe.  </s>
<s> needless to say this will be a big issue for me.  </s>
<s> how much should i be expecting to pay and what should i make sure that i get for my money?  </s>
<s> all you need to do is watch other's uploads to youtube to see that many don't understand lighting.  </s>
<s> your model is too similar to other webcams i own.  </s>
<s> to get good results i have to add more light to the room than what you would suspect.  </s>
<s> a pair of 100 watt lights in addition to the normal room lighting worked for me.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> 2 100watt light bulbs?  </s>
<s> wow!  </s>
<s> hope the bulk of your video conferencing is not at night!  </s>
<s> what would be considered different?  </s>
<s> i'm reading lots of reviews and the majority of the complaints come from models that are incompatible or have problematic software or drivers.  </s>
<s> notice how much light he pours into it.  </s>
<s> i wonder if you've done this before.  </s>
<s> those that pan lighting tips usually haven't been at this long.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> since this would be the first webcam i'm getting obviously i haven't any experience with them.  </s>
<s> i'm not panning your lighting tips though.  </s>
<s> sorry if you got that impression.  </s>
<s> what i was getting at though, was you said that the camera i saw was no different from the ones you owned.  </s>
<s> so i'm asking, what would be different?  </s>
<s> thanks for the link.  </s>
<s> unfortunately, i am at work now so i can't view youtube links.  </s>
<s> but i will check it out at home.  </s>
<s> finally saw that link you posted.  </s>
<s> that was a fascinating video.  </s>
<s> thanks again for sharing.  </s>
<s> i'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however.  </s>
<s> i'd just like to use it for video im, so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid, i don't think i'd mind.  </s>
<s> i do appreciate your responses though.  </s>
<s> the basics apply to getting good video.  </s>
<s> as i own too many webcams all i can do is share how i get good video.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
