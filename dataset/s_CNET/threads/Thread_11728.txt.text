i have been given a 512mb sandisk with info. on it. how can i delete the info. so i can use it in a camara? thanks,rich
but my old (real old!) canon couldn't support such a large cf card so be sure to try but don't be surprised if it fails. next time consider sharing the camera make, model, age.
worked like a charm thank you rich
