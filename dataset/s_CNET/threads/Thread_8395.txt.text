looking to buy a pc video editing system but confused about what makes the system faster where editing and rendering is concerned. please advise: which memory am i better off with? ddr2 ecc sdram or 400mhz ddr memory 3.40 ghz single processor or xeon processor? does the video card make the difference? which video card do you recommend? thanks in advance pam 50
we have a paltry 4 mb ati radeongo card on on dvd rendered box after we tested with some 2 hundred card and found no difference in performance. it seems to be all about the cpu, cpu cache and memory speeds. next in line are hard disk speeds. bob
most video editing software is extremely dependent on cpu and ram. i'm not sure which way to go on the ram question - i personally haven't put a lot of stock in ram speed differences. i use an amd athlon 64 cpu and pc 2700 ddr ram (1.5gb) running avid xpress pro editing software. i have basically no problems with rendering, layers, etc. i also am running (internal) ata/ide drives and connecting both usb and firewire external drives. access of the externals is sometimes a little slow, but not enough to affect the editing performance. the video card requirements depend on the software requirements. for example, avid - and many other high end programs don't require more than about a 64mb video card in most cases. i run an nvidia 128mb card in my system. i've been told not to waste my money on a high end/high ram capacity video card for editing - the current softwares won't use most of the onboard video ram anyway.
look here 4 the ram ddr2 is better but the site backs me up. hav fun  btw:4 this site may need to press refresh a couple of times till it is all loaded, also look here for your graphics card question aswell.
pam, use the faster memory, min 512mb -&gt; 1 gig better. 3.0 intel p4 800mhz cpu will have enough power on a dual channel m/b. visit the video guys here  lots and lots of information on systems and video editing bill .
