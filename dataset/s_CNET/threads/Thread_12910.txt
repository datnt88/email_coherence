13546	1	54669	652298	651853	michael geist	1/2/05 3:03 pm	1.10467818e12	i would connect the modem directly to a pc....	to see if an internet connection exists. modems go bad as well.

13546	5	54669	652800	652676	snowboardr	1/2/05 7:27 pm	1.10469402e12	settings	i updated it when the last update came out some time last year. those settings i never touched i let it go on its own and it worked fine except for now.
13546	6	54669	653041	652800	michael geist	1/3/05 1:59 am	1.10471754e12	the only thing left...	is to swap it out with a known good one.
