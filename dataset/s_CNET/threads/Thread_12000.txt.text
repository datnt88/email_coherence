i will run 3 samsung t220 screens (white and blue connectors available). the computer is windows 7 pro, with a 300w power supply; with 1 pci express x16, 1 pci espress x 1 and 2 pci slots. there is an onboard radeon, but i am told that it will be disabled once i add a card. the 3 monitor graphics cards are pricey and since i have the room i could use some advice on two video cards (for 3 monitors). i do not play any games or do any video editing or watch hd movies, but i do watch the screens all day when trading. probably, pretty basic cards will work (especially with the 300w power supply). any suggestions? thanks so much. paul
you will not find good free support from the makers but combos from the same maker are the best.  gives you the right idea of mixing some agp and pci but we have to play along and figure out that we can use pcie and a pci slot. let's go shopping. let's use  for the first pcie card.  and the pci card to match up.  remember that no one will tell you all will work fine. but these don't come with dire warnings of needing 900 watt power supplies. tip&gt; keep in the same maker when having multiple cards. as an alternative use some usb to vga to for the third monitor. example at  but ask about windows 7 drivers. bob
radeon 4650 pcie and 9000 pci sounds like a good way to go. i tried the 4350 which gave me good results and is a touch cheaper, but the fan was a little loud. i have no real benchmark to evaluate these because i had been using two old matrox cards in a 7 year old computer. the 4350 did provide much superior detail so i'm sure we're on the right track. thanks. by the way, do you happen to know if either of these cards can be used to watch cnbc (or at least listen to it) while trading? paul
i watch video off the internet on lesser cards.
