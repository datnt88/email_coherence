hello everyone, i have a dell optiplex gx270 and it's only a few years old. i recently started getting problems with the monitor, usb mouse and usb keyboard shutting off after a normal boot up. it's not always consistant with boot up. sometimes it will happen when running a program. the power light is still on and fan is running when it occurs leaving me to believe it's power supply. i also replaced the motherboard 3v lithium battery after i got the system voltage battery low warning.i did have the machine on a surge protector and into the wall electrical outlet, hoping that would fix my issue. i still have the same result. please advise if i should replace my power supply or motherboard next. or both. thanks in advance symbolize
sounds like it may be a problem with the connection between your battery and the laptop. if the connector to the battery is on the motherboard then yes motherboard should be changed but definitely sounds like a bad connection somewhere.
try to change the power supply with sum1 elses and c if its workin.if not then surely u need to change the motherboard or call a technician.
