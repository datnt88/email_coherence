<s> hey guys and gals, i have an msi radeon 6970 and the fan is unbearably loud.  </s>
<s> i turn down the fan speed to deal with this, but as a result the gpu really heats up when playing games like bf3 and skyrim.  </s>
<s> i was wondering if you guys know about any good gpu fans i can replace the default one with.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> pull the card out and examine it.  </s>
<s> if the bearings are shot then a visit to a computer store might provide a replacement.  </s>
<s> you really answered your own question.  </s>
<s> if the fan is operating as in trying to cool your gpu, then its doing its job.  </s>
<s> you already noticed the reduction of fan speed doesn't help matters, thus i suspect the fan is again doing exactly its job.  </s>
<s> overall, you're whole pc needs to be cooled as the &quot;airflow&quot; isn't getting the heat out fast enough.  </s>
<s> either improve the case airflow setup or mount at least a slot card fan to directly exhaust near the gpu.  </s>
<s> replacing the gpu fan won't necessarily help as it still needs to exhaust the heat.  </s>
<s> if your pc case doesn't have a &quot;side fan&quot; maybe you should think of mounting or making one.  </s>
<s> your gaming is sooner or later will defeat your current cooling efforts.  </s>
<s> if once you case cooling is controlled, then the gpu fan may throttle down as it doesn't need to be high rpm all the time.  </s>
<s> if you case also has an empty fan mounting port, get the required fan.  </s>
<s> make sure your case is as dust free as possible, clear vents or filters on frt.  </s>
<s> panel if need be.  </s>
<s> fyi- it always helps to post all details of your pc. tada -----willy  </s>
<s> if so, it is time to arrange for return since modifying would void the warranty.  </s>
<s> if your machine's builder is there, talk to them about changing it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> and go to places like for replacement cooling things.  </s>

<s> thanks, for answering my question and next time i will post more about my computer.  </s>
<s> there is nothing wrong with the gpu fan that i have, the default fan is just really rubish and i am going to replace it and was seeing if you guys knew about any good ones.  </s>
<s> next time i will try to word the question better.  </s>
<s> thanks, for giving me some ideas and i will try to get all the dust out of my computer more often.  </s>
<s> i built my own pc, so i can't return it.  </s>
<s> thanks, this is exactly what i need.  </s>
