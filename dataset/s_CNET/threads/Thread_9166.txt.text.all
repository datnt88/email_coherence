<s> could anyone suggest a case and powersupply to use for my pentium d 830 build... i have a good idea of what mb i want but could base my decision on suggestions... also, i would like to use xp mce but can get xp pro for 30 bucks at my university, any reason i should spend the extra 100 to get the media center version?  </s>
<s> as for the psu i would get something from antec, ocz, seasonic, enermax that are at least 450watts or more.  </s>
<s> as for the case, i dont know how much you want to spend for it, i guess this one, but it might take up room in the dorm.  </s>
<s> if you are aiming at a mce, it be better to stay away from the flashy gaming cases.  </s>
<s> a elegant, yet expensive choice, would be lian-li.  </s>
<s> those cases could fit anywhere and still look good.  </s>
<s> i don't reccomend the skinny cases (the ones that look like regular cases on their side).  </s>
<s> they are smaller, and it looks like they are harder to upgrade.  </s>
<s> just wondering, any specific reason for using intel?  </s>
<s> rather than amd.  </s>
<s> don't want to start an argument, but the benches speak for themselvse.  </s>
