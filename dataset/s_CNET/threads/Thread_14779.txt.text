how can i get my old but trusty 4050n hp printer to work with my new computer that has no parallel port? i have some other ports on the back of the printer. two kind of look like those used to connect up a monitor. another looks like a ps2 port i think it is called that was used and i guess still is used to connect a keyboard or mouse. thanks in advance for any help, dave

you could try a parallel to usb adapter, that is a maybe. if the printer software is not compatible with the os and there isn't a driver package update from the manufacturer (hp)you likely have a sea anchor, good luck!!!
