i recently installed dsl. the modem is connected to a windows xp (home edition) machine and i have a windows '98se machine networked to the home portal via a wireless adapter. 
my first problem is that the '98se machine usually will not boot up unless i unplug the wireless adapter from the usb port. the machine then boots but i immediately receive the following two windows error messages. 
------------------------------------------------------- message one: c:program filesbellsouthwlan utilityswlu.exe 
------------------------------------------------------- message two: the adsldpc.dll 
file is linked to missing export ntdll.dll:rtllnitunicodestring. ------------------------------------------------------- i have downloaded the ntdll.dll but am not sure if it goes is c:windowssystem. 
i tried placing the file in that directory once before when i received the same error messages during a software installation and it did not solve the problem. is the rtllnitunicodestring part of the registry? 
i have run regedit and cannot find it. 
i would appreciate any help anyone can provide. 
thanks, hwy61visitor 
read the short hit list at 
but to tell the truth, this issue with the usb adapter looks like an incomplete install of 98 without the latest drivers for the motherboard and other devices.
