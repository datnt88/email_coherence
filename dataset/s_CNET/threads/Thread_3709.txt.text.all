<s> i recently installed dsl. the modem is connected to a windows xp (home edition) machine and i have a windows '98se machine networked to the home portal via a wireless adapter.  </s>
<s> my first problem is that the '98se machine usually will not boot up unless i unplug the wireless adapter from the usb port. the machine then boots but i immediately receive the following two windows error messages.  </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- message one: c:program filesbellsouthwlan utilityswlu.exe  </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- message two: the adsldpc.dll  </s>
<s> file is linked to missing export ntdll.dll:rtllnitunicodestring. ------------------------------------------------------- i have downloaded the ntdll.dll but am not sure if it goes is c:windowssystem.  </s>
<s> i tried placing the file in that directory once before when i received the same error messages during a software installation and it did not solve the problem. is the rtllnitunicodestring part of the registry?  </s>
<s> i have run regedit and cannot find it.  </s>
<s> i would appreciate any help anyone can provide.  </s>
<s> thanks, hwy61visitor  </s>
<s> read the short hit list at  </s>
<s> but to tell the truth, this issue with the usb adapter looks like an incomplete install of 98 without the latest drivers for the motherboard and other devices.  </s>
