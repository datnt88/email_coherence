<s> hey everyone, i have a computer that is not working and i have no idea what to do.  </s>
<s> i was mad the other day so i kicked the computer.  </s>
<s> not hard or anything just enough to put a smll dent in it.  </s>
<s> its a hp desktop.  </s>
<s> it doesnt have the orig hard drive in it or ram.  </s>
<s> when turned on both the hard drives click like crazy and it will not boot.  </s>
<s> im not sure if it boots or not since no video is showing on the moniter it just says video cable connected?  </s>
<s> so i dont know if it boots or not.  </s>
<s> it has onboard video.  </s>
<s> i have a 40g hdd in it and an 80g hdd in it.  </s>
<s> they both click like hell when started. opened on of then up and the disk spins but after a while of the arm moving back and forth while clicking it stops spinning.  </s>
<s> i tapped it a few times and now it will continue spinning until i shut it off.  </s>
<s> are these hard drives shot?  </s>
<s> i mean i know there probly shot there old, but can i get files off of them and what not?  </s>
<s> if it is the just video will these drives even boot like that?  </s>
<s> im putting in a pci/agp video card later to see if that is the problem.  </s>
<s> these hdds are formatted with windows xp, can i put these in my g4 mac to get files off of? or do i need to put them in a windows computer to back up?  </s>
<s> a kick that dents a pc case isn't a small one and opening a hard drive to troubleshoot it is an almost certain kiss of death.  </s>
<s> i'd say to evaluate the damage and see what's salvageable you'd need to do such one component at a time using another pc to test them.  </s>
<s> i doubt you're clicking hard drives are going to be recognizable on any pc, however.  </s>
<s> there are data recovery services available.  </s>
<s> i can't say how much they charge but it may be more then the cost of an entire pc and with no guarantee of complete success.  </s>
<s> if you have another pc that can handle the same components that is the way to go.  </s>
<s> i do that often but just be carefull one bad component can do other damage to your system.  </s>
<s> if the computer did not get kicked on the side the mb is on it might not be that bad.  </s>
<s> cables would be the first thing i would check then the cpu or check for a cracked mb. it take a bit to damage a hd. key components 1) mb 2) cpu if those components or ok the pc is repairable  </s>
<s> the computer got kicked in the front with the cd drive getting most of the damage.  </s>
<s> mb was removed as well as cpu the whole thing was cleaned.  </s>
<s> runs perfect.  </s>
<s> no damage at all except for the cd drive.  </s>
<s> both hard drives recognize in the bios but neither will boot.  </s>
<s> i brought them in to a local computer place and they tested them and said that they were none responsive and shot, but i dont belive this as it was a free test, nd they were trying to get me to spend money so that they could do further tests.  </s>
<s> the drives are not unresponsive since they recognize in the computer.  </s>
<s> i just need to repair the os with the disk.  </s>
<s> i put them in a really old pc i have and it said disk boot failure insert disk. the disk i had wouldnt work i think i burned it wrong, and this pc could not have two hard drives for some reason as it would start for a second and shut off and then when i unplpugged one of them it would start.  </s>
<s> so idk its weird but im working on it.  </s>
<s> i think what i will do is get a sata controller and use a 320 notebook hdd in it.  </s>
<s> and of course upgrade to maybe 1gb of ram from 512mb  </s>
