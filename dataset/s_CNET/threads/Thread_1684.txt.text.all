<s> i recently purchased a lcd monitor (dell ultrasharp 1905fp) which has both dvi-d and vga ports. the video card on my pc is ati x300 which also has both ports.  </s>
<s> which connectors should i be using between the pc and monitor?  </s>
<s> should i use the newer dvi-d connection or the serial vga connection? is there any advantages to using one over the other?  </s>
<s> please advise.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> this uses a digital signal.  </s>
<s> don't spnd a lot on a dvi-d cable.  </s>
<s> some stores will charge you $40-75.  </s>
<s> you can get them at newegg or tigerdirect for $20. make sure you get the length you need.  </s>
<s> is better in terms of clarity and hence always preferred to vga ones.  </s>
<s> my kids desktop looks better on vga.  </s>
<s> we had it connected with hdmi and for some reason it looks better on vga.  </s>
<s> all this means is that you should try each option.  </s>
