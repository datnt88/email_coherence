okay i have it to where i have my bigger lg in front of me hooked up to my alienware via hdmi, and my smaller sony hooked up via hdmi to the left of me. i can't seem to make it to where when i play a game like ac3 for example i can minimize the game, open firefox through my sony (smaller to my right) and keep firefox up and then maximize ac3 on my lg. how can i do this? i know theres gotta be a way.
since the game takes complete focus you can't mouse over to the browser and use it. to gain another screen i have a tablet for what i wanted to see on the side. bob

hi as far as monitors go you can do what you like it is up to you on how you choose to do it it is far easier to use windows display settings to setup your monitors than nvidia control panel one screen can be the correct orientation while the other the reverse plus you can set different resolutions for each i know for fact that you can attach 4 monitors all replicating the same desktop using intel mb graphics and nvidia graphics card to which nvidia have stated is not possible at all yours robjlee64
this update is in relation to any tv monitor hdmi dvi vga dsub that you can connect to a pc now depending on what ops sys you are using they should work in the same way and to function correctly you may also have to update your monitor driver and the firmware update for your tv which may require you to use some kind of usb memory stick the same applys to blu ray and dvd players but do not confuse this with dvd rom player devices as windows does this for you automatically i hope this helps yours robjlee64
