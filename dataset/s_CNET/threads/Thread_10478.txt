(i got two access points in my house) -- (i have to restart my laptop to fix it) but, i wont have any issues if i turn off the wireless on my laptop before turning off the router. it would connect again with no problem. does anyone think it could be a service that i disabled or put on manual? any help greatly appreciated. thank you!
