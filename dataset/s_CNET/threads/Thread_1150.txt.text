i plug a usb cord into my computer (imac g5 running os 10.5.8) and into my tablet (craig cmp741e). it says that the device is drawing too much power and the computer shuts down the usb port. the cable works fine on other devices. i don''t know how else to transfer media to my tablet. help!!
maybe this one is defective?
i did not. it does have an adapter that i can plug my flash drive into. temp fix; also my phone can take my 8gb card and i can transfer to the card from there.
something could be defective and there is no reason for you to get stuck with a bad unit. bob
