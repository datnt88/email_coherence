im setting up a linksys wireless-g broadband router model number wrt54g2. ive got the actual wireless router itself set up to a modem, internet and the computer. the desktop doesnt have a working disk drive so im trying to run the setup program on this laptop. the laptop has a working drive and is receiving a wireless signal from the router. thats kind of why im here. ive tried many times to run the setup program and i never get past the install router part four that tells me to plug it. it trys to find the router but doesnt. when it gets to check connection it disables my network adapter. ive gone into the intel wireless troubleshooter and from there gone into the device manager and enable my adapter before i run the setup. it still disables it. my question is does my router need to be connected to the computer i run the setup on? my next question is wtf am i doing wrong??? this is driving me nuts. thanks in advance.
located in the forum sticky . go here and click on user guide. if you go to page 4 of the manual, it explains on how to set it up. make sure to download the latest firmware while you're there. rick
nope it didnt work. i figured it out though. your very unhelpful.
we have the forum sticky to help us with the hundreds of people that need help. if we didn't use that as a starting point you would get no help here as it's too much to duplicate the same answers to each post. be exact. what exactly do you want? bob
you didnt answer my question, then you told me to refer to the help manual. i wouldnt be having to deal with you if i had gotten the answer from the manual. i figured it out before you responded, but 1 pt. for effort.
that your response here was not to the same person who gave you the advice you are griping about.
locking this discussion before it has a chance to degrade.
