<s> my system is no punk but could use a good boost for gaming.  </s>
<s> o.k. so, my specs are as follows: amd64 3000+ (venice no oc) 2 gb geil dual channel pc3200 asrock 939-dual (pci and agp) 256mb ati aiw x800 agp 2 x 160 gb seagate drives lite-on dual layer dvd-rw lite-on dvd-rom blah, blah, blah so what i am wondering is, say im limited to about a 500.00 upgrade which way should i go?  </s>
<s> i mean i love my all-in-wonder but should i go with a newer gaming card and run both (agp and pci) or do i really need more ram (4gb seems excessive).  </s>
<s> or the motherboard does support the dual core cpus.  </s>
<s> any input is appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> before i begin, that machine looks solid: good job!  </s>
<s> let's go!  </s>
<s> i'm gonna skip the cpu and talk abt in the end. the 2gb is good, very good actually.  </s>
<s> storage/removable storage looks good.  </s>
<s> for clarifcation, this is your motherboard, correct: motherboard looks good, i like the hybridish combination of agp and pci-e.  </s>
<s> (btw, is that a typo in the mobo description?) the only thing that isn't very very best in it's field is just the cpu and gpu.  </s>
<s> if you are getting solid numbers in games, i would upgrade the cpu.  </s>
<s> if it is sluggish in non-gpu intensive apps, like uh... word?  </s>
<s> (lol) jk, but you know that i mean, right?  </s>
<s> also, whats the wattage, make, and maybe rails of the psu?  </s>
<s> name and series would work, too.  </s>
<s> a reasonable upgrade for the mobo would be either semi-entry line x2, maybe the 4200+ or if you look hard enough, you could squeeze in a 4400+.  </s>
<s> (mobo does support x2) i think they have the same clock, not sure though.  </s>
<s> think it is more advanced in other things.  </s>
<s> anyways, if you get a gpu i'd go for a 7800gt, easily in your budget.  </s>
<s> or do want to buy both a gpu and a cpu?  </s>
<s> otherwise, the machine looks good.  </s>
<s> good luck, and remember in the end: its your call.  </s>
<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>
<s> yes that is the board and i thought that was a neat feature myself.  </s>
<s> they can be used together believe it or not, one for editing (aiw) one for gaming (hmmm) at the same time as i understand it.  </s>
<s> i had not thought of the psu, it's some off brand 480w that came with my transformers case (yes, i am that geek with the autobot case).  </s>
<s> unfortunatly i am pretty sure i'm limited to either a cpu or the gpu (i think i'll upgrade the psu no matter what).  </s>
<s> so i know it's up to me in the end but if it was your system and your money which would you choose?  </s>
<s> i found a 4200 x2 and a 7800gt both for around 680.00, not sure if i can pull another 180.00 out of nowhere though.  </s>
