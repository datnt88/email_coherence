these days, i'm hearing more and more about alienware--&quot;extremely&quot; good things, and &quot;extremely&quot; bad. here are just two examples:   there are countless more. now i'd like to ask all of you what you &quot;really think&quot; of this &quot;controversial company&quot;...is it gold, or is it dross? jdm
i would say alienware is a ripoff. try monarch or falcon northwest.
after seeing some of their prices on things i'd be inclined to agree. uber expensive at the very least. seems as if you do seem to pay for the name in their case though... *shrugs*
the idea behind the high performance gaming pc builder is to lure newbies away from mainstream builders, convince them that they need the high end pc, that building it yourself is evil, and that this is the best option alienware though the years has to adapt, with compaines like ibuypower offering low cost desktops that at least appear high power, and companies like dell, compaq and hp responding with high performance gaming models of their own that use the latest and greatest of hardware, at a low cost (dimension xps, compaq's x gaming systme, and hp used to have a special retail agreement with systemax/tigerdirect to sell lightly modified workstations with geforce fx 5700 level cards (back when those were good) and good pentium 4 cpu's with nice upgradeability and good ram at a low cost)

alienware has recently been trying to overhaul its customer service. they appear to be contacting disgruntled customers (months after the problems were originally reported) and offering to fix everything that needs fixing. it seems pretty clear that all the bad press on cnet and other forums has really hurt alienware's numbers--and made the company more willing to take care of their paying customers. that's just one more example of &quot;people power&quot; getting real results. don't ever let anyone tell you that your postings on cnet and other forums &quot;don't matter&quot; and &quot;won't make any difference&quot;. they certainly do matter, and they certainly will make a difference! rock on! sincerely, jdm
