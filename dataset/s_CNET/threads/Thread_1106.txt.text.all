<s> hi, i want to buy 2 of these computers: and was wondering if it is possible to link the 2 together so it is one computer?  </s>
<s> if so could tell me what i have to do to link them.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> but folk are often thinking that this adds ram or cpu power to your windows machines.  </s>
<s> it doesn't.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i dont think what you are trying to do is possible.  </s>
<s> you could put the computers on your network.  </s>
<s> if you use a basic wireless router with wired connections, you could set up file sharing to where all files on each computer would be accessible by the other.  </s>
<s> you must give the files proper permissions so that you can access them from each computer.  </s>
<s> it always a lot more painless if you use the same userid and password on the computers.  </s>
