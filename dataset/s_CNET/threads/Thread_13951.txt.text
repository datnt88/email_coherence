i recently did a fresh install of windows xp pro and threw in sp3. when i go to update drivers for my 8800gtx, my resolution and color drops from 1400x1050 - 32 bit down to 800x600 - 4 bit. i tried to increase the settings but it drops the setting back down on its own. i had to do a rollback to the previous drivers to fix the problem. is it the sp3 thats causing the issue or something else? the previous drivers that i'm on right now came with the gfx card, which is 2+ years old and cant play any games with outdated drivers. i'm thinking about just going back to sp2. thanks in advance.
delete your display adapters in device manager before doing the install. after rebooting, do not allow windows to reinstall the drivers. then install the latest nvidia drivers -- that should fix what ails you.
omg, there really is a holy cow. it worked! thanks! can you explained to me what happened? all of my previous driver updates, i'd just click to update without having to do what you told me. is it just a new procedure that i have to go through with sp3?
who knows. but if a device has become misconfigured, the driver installation should be replaced, not updated. deleting the device and preventing windows from reinstalling it usually lets you do a clean driver instation, rather than updating the existing driver (which is misconfigured).
