<s> have an imac 400dv, slot load, os 9.2.2 that blew up.  </s>
<s> logic board and analog board are toast.  </s>
<s> repair removed hard drive, and determined data was recoverable.  </s>
<s> now, have bought new imac g5, 1.8, sd.and would like to transfer some files from old hd if possible.  </s>
<s> backup was current to 2 weeks before crash and burn.  </s>
<s> what is best way to grab files from old hd? do i need an enclosure for old hd as well as cable?  </s>
<s> thanks for help.  </s>
<s> given that your old machine is toast, a good and lasting way to move the files and have an external drive for later use is to purchase a firewire enclosure.  </s>
<s> other world computing sell a nice one for about $60. it comes, as they all do, with the necessary firewire cable and instructions.  </s>
<s> as you are using os x, no drivers are necessary.  </s>
<s> just put the old drive in the enclosure.  </s>
<s> connect the firewire cable at both ends and power up the enclosure.  </s>
<s> within seconds, your old hd will appear on the desktop, ready for you to drag your old data files to the new machine.  </s>
<s> do not drag the application files to the new machine, they will not work, but you knew that anyway.  </s>
<s> it's a really easy fix and you have the external drive for extra storage later.  </s>
<s> hope this helps p  </s>
<s> thank you for the quick reply.  </s>
<s> sounds great, i like the idea of the extra drive, and also thanks for letting me know where i can go to get the enclosure.  </s>
<s> m.s.  </s>

<s> i got a firewire external drive enclosure from owc and everything works like a charm.  </s>
<s> thanks again for the great help.  </s>

<s> i appreciate you coming back to say that it all worked.  </s>
