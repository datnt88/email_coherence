ok, so on nearly every computer ive ever seen, you can access the bios settings and info by pressing a certain key at startup (f2 or f8 or whatever)....but this hp doesnt present that option. at start up the first screen i see is a blue one with the hp logo, which on other systems is the screen that comes after the option for bios. any thoughts? the system is close to 4 years old. it originally had windows me, (now xp pro). i want to see my bios info to figure out if a hard drive upgrade is possible.
or f1 or f2 and start tapping it as soon as the computer begins to boot up.......don't wait for the logo to leave. once inside the bios/setup, you can then turn off the logo as well because if you ever need to get into safemode you won't see the menu choices after using f8 because the logo will hide it from being viewed. i hate logos....... toni
first, if you have a usb type kybd., forget it, get a older ps/2 type in order for the kybd. to be active. next, visit the hp support website and naviagte to your model's details on entering the bios. you can try f2, but f1, or f10 are good canditdates as well as any other &quot;oem determined&quot; key, just the way it is. even within the hp models, whats used on one model may not be used on another model, but the model series, may. tada -----willy
