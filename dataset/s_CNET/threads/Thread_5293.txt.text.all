<s> how can you tell which motherboard or cpu would be compatible with xp when building a system for the first time.  </s>
<s> is check their web site for the board and drivers listed for it.  </s>
<s> drivers will specify what os they are for.  </s>
<s> it's a good bet that, if any are for xp, the whole board is xp compatible.  </s>
<s> imho, most new mtrbds.  </s>
<s> now being offered are still going to be xp compatible. the cpu will follow with the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> its going to be a problem roughly in another 2-3 yrs.  </s>
<s> yet.  </s>
<s> while you can certainly still make a xp based system, the current os is vista which will be supplanted by win7.  </s>
<s> don't get too stuck on xp, because if you have upgrade later or move on beause of s/w issues, then your then current xp system may not be all that ready to do so.  </s>
<s> regardless, as the other poster offered, visit the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> support website for availability of xp drivers and such as this is a telling sign of support now and hopefully later.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
