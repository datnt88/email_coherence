i have a hard drive enclosure connected via usb. it was working fine all along. i had to disconnect it to move my computer and when i hooked it back up, the drive letter doesn't appear. when i go into my device manager it shows up and when i click &quot;properties&quot; it says, &quot;this device is working properly.&quot; any advice? its a western digital wd300bb. i am running xp pro.
if you remember then that's it. fixes include software like getdataback and zero assumption recovery. i take it you put it back in the same usb socket, another socket and have powered down the entire as part of your troubleshooting. bob
i had tried a couple of different usb ports with no result. but i had neglected to try a different usb wire. i did and the disk booted up and all the data is there. thank you.
what i do with said cable. it's promptly repurposed here but most should cut it in two and toss it. such cables can cause data corruption later even if it appears to work. may i add that was good troubleshooting on your part. bob
...its back to square one. the thunderstorms in the ne knocked out my power and when i booted back up, its doing the same thing.
never stick with fat32 at the end of an usb cable... bob
