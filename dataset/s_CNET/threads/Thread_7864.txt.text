i have a motherboard (asus p4pe-x) that supports pc3200, which gives the machine a faster front side bus (fsb). i originally began with a single pc2700 - 512 ram. i bought two 256 ram sticks of pc3200, and removed the pc2700. my question now is, i have three slots for memory, can i run pc3200 w/pc2700?
it will operate at the 333mhz rate. this if course given it's the same kind of ram just different speeds.
what does the book that came with your asus p4pe-x say? you can put different speeds in, but they will all run at the slower speed. john
never miss match ram! it defeats the purpose! sell the pc2700 on ebay and buy pc3200 to match what you have. better yet i would look for three sticks of 512 at 3200 that match. more bang for your bucks!
