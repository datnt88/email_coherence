<s> good day, i am building a new pc and i purchased an aoc lm760 lcd 17&quot; lcd.  </s>
<s> however it has a d-sub connector only and my video card has both vga and dvi-i connector.  </s>
<s> the package contains a dvi to vga adapter.  </s>
<s> my question is will my lcd show an improvement once i have used the adapter to the dvi-i rather than the vga connector.  </s>
<s> i know that some lcd's do the conversion from analog to digital within their electronics, however in this case will the lcd know that it is a digital input it is connecting to or will try to use the analog circuitry.  </s>
<s> will i see a difference.  </s>
<s> the lcd will probably auto-switch to the proper input.  </s>
<s> if not, enter the menu and manually aim at the appropriate input.  </s>
<s> as soon as i hit submit, i finally understood your question.  </s>
<s> you shouldn't see any improvement using the dvi connector with a dvi-vga adapter, so just plug the monitor directly into the vga (analog) output.  </s>
