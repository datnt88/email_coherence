i'm a photographer and i'm trying to get raw images (.cr2) from my pc to another person's mac. i think i have tried jpgs and they didn't work either so the file extension should be irrelevant but there you go just in case. it's a couple of weddings so they are huge files. here's what i've tried: *i put each folder on my external hard drive, 14g worth. when i am done i see that the images transferred fine and my hard drive is 14g fuller now. i hand that over to the mac person and he says the folders are empty when trying to view from his computer. *then i got his external hard drive and ended up with the exact same result. his drive was 14g fuller and everything. * i have burned discs for him and they come up empty as well what do i need to do? please help!
i bet the apple user is a bit new at this. if the files do not show its possible they can't or don't know how to add ntfs support to their machine. try another apple owner. bob
why didn't i think of that? seriously, if it's on their end and i think it is, what do they need to do? please people i need help with this issue, not sarcastic remarks.
have them install ntfs support or have them format the drive on their machine and use a linux boot cd to copy files to their apple formatted drive. we discuss the linux boot cd at the top of the forum. it is not sarcastic but stating that you might have to upgrade that person. bob
