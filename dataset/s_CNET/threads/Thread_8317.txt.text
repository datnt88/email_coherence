is direct x 10 and dual core and windows vista and all those new video cards? are they all going 64 bit? leaving us 32 bitters in the dust?
while i've seen some progress in 64 bit land, it's been quite slow. since lcd (lowest common denominator) runs the marketplace i don't expect 32 bit systems to vanish or even be slighted for years. bob
thats great news.
