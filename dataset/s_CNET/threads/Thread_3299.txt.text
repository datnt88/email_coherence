just picked up a nas box for my seagate 400 gig sata drive. got it connected to my network and in the process i found that the drive needed to be formatted in ext3. never heard of it before. i used the nas and it's software to format the drive and it works perfectly. a short search said ext3 was a linux format. anyone know why the drive had to use that format? is that standard?
is the little computer inside that box is running linux and to avoid microsoft's fee for that other file system they went with an open source or free file system. bob
it's a gigabit nas for a sata drive with usb ports. was only 29 bucks.
but they were out by the time i went to order it. yup its a small cpu running linux.
