i purchased an hp dv8000 laptop last april 2006, along with the cingular 3g connect card. i agreed to a two year cingular contract. since then, my hp has been sent in for repair to hp 3 times. (a monitor problem) since they could not fix it i received a new hp dv9000 last week. now i have two big problems, not only does cingular not have the software for the communications mgr out yet for vista; but my new laptop does not have a pcmcia slot. cingular does not have any wireless card for the new system. they will not let me out of the contract and hp has no solution. verizon has a usb style card for $129.00 online (149.00 in store) supported by vista with 2 yr agreement and $79 a month w/o voice account. this is a mess and all because hp could not fix the xp laptop; with two slots standard. they promised to replace my defective 8000 with exactly the same features but they don't make them exactly the same any more saying the pcmica slot is old technology. they should pay for my $175.00 break of contract fee with cingular but will not. technology perhaps is going to fast.
it only helps those that use it at work or home. look up the evdo router on google.com. as to the slots, people move too fast and get a laptop and don't notice the new slots that have been out for over a year now. bob
and ask if they will upgrade your replacement to a refurb business notebook that has the pcmcia slot. you may have to pay for the upgrade. in any case it looks like you can't avoid additional expense and that's disgraceful for all the vendors in your situation. re technology going too fast...it's certainly not well planned for consumer products and every competitor is rushing to grab the money as long as consumers are anxious to part with it. next time if you need technology stability, look for the business products that have longer lifecycles. costs more but you can expect longer usability than the consumer cousins.
