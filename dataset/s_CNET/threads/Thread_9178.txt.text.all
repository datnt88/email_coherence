<s> my linksys 54gs is about 5 years old now and lately it has been shuting off during the night while im downloading files.  </s>
<s> i have already put an updated firmware on it and doesnt seem to help.  </s>
<s> i do alot of gaming on xbox live (wired) and was thinking if there was a better router out there.  </s>
<s> thanx for the input  </s>
<s> -&gt; is it setup per the forum sticky?  </s>
<s> we know that some routers fail with mac filtering which is not prescribed in this forum's sticky post (it's at the top of this forum.) bob  </s>
<s> like i was saying, ive had the router setup for almost 6 years without a hitch.  </s>
<s> but recently it has been dropping connection at night and it seems signal not as strong.  </s>
<s> was just wondering how much of a &quot;shelf life&quot; these things got, and maybe try to upgrade  </s>
<s> the question is still left open.  </s>
<s> since you didn't answer or supply the settings you may be spending where you could have avoided the outlay.  </s>

<s> i dont have access to my routers settings at this time.  </s>
<s> but im sure it was set up properly since i have put many hours in research getting the proper settings for my specific router.  </s>
<s> i guees my main question is.....do routers tend to need replacing after a number of years??....i know there have been upgrades since my last purchase and more or less leaning to a new router..  </s>
<s> but the settings do not work for years.  </s>
<s> here's why.  </s>
<s> my best example is how folk used to set up wep for protection.  </s>
<s> that's now broken in less than 2 minutes and for a short time mac filtering provided a stop gap security measure.  </s>
<s> these are now out dated so your settings can be outdated with some kid next door interfering with your system.  </s>
<s> go ahead and buy your new router but it seems a shame we can't update to today's advised settings first to see if we can avoid the replacement.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have updated my router with new firmware but not sure what your talking about &quot;setup&quot;.  </s>
<s> you mentioned about a sticky in this forum but have looked at stickys here and didnt see anything that would help me.  </s>
<s> if im over looking it please point me in the direction.  </s>
<s> im eager to learn...thanx again  </s>
<s> at the top there are now 4 posts stuck to the top. the 2 locked ones are the more informational ones with the longer one that can be summed up as router firmware, router defaults, simple ssid broadcasting and then wpa for security.  </s>
<s> these settings are hard won information from many setups in the field over the years.  </s>
<s> we start with that to see if we can avoid the usual issues and repeating past mistakes.  </s>
