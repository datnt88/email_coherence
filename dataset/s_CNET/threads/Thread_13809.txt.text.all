<s> im not sure that my title is clear or not, so here is my question: i just moved to a new apartment, and after a quick wlan search on my laptop, i found out that i have a few open & free wireless lans in my neighborhood (yay!  </s>
<s> :d).  </s>
<s> so currently, i access internet on my laptop and cell phone using these networks.  </s>
<s> now, i want to kind of expand my home wireless network using the access point feature on one of these wireless routers (cisco-linksys wrt54g2 or cisco-linksys wrt54gl).  </s>
<s> here is how: i want to have internet on my belkin desktop skype phone.  </s>
<s> it has an ethernet port on it, and i am going to connect it to the router.  </s>
<s> i want to connect my western digital wd tv live to both internet and my laptop.  </s>
<s> again, it has an ethernet port on it, so i want to connect it to my router using a rj45 cable.  </s>
<s> moreover, by using the access point feature on the router i want to access internet, and i also want to stream video files from my laptop (which will be connected to router wirelessly as well).  </s>
<s> lastly, will i be able to use my printer from my laptop (it has wireless capability)?  </s>
<s> im pretty sure that i can do that anyway i am not so familiar with wireless routers and networking, so is it doable?  </s>
<s> id appreciate your help  </s>
<s> to people who might think i'm stealing (!): (1) i asked my next door neighbor and he said it's ok if i use his wireless connection!  </s>
<s> plus, (2) i don't do hard-core downloading or video streaming or anything!!! i only check my emails and make skype phone calls!  </s>
<s> also, (3) according to state law it's not stealing if the network is not locked!  </s>
<s> one more question: which router do you recommend for this matter?  </s>
<s> but such a setup would tax most users.  </s>
<s> so my answer is if you can't then no. if you could you'll do that.  </s>
<s> good luck! and no to the printer over wifi in such a setup.  </s>
<s> just use usb.  </s>
<s> and while wifi printing may be possible where would you find support for such a cranky setup?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ... you are using other peoples' open[i.e. unsecured] network .... have you thought about security ?  </s>
