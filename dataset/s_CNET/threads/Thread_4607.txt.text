how do you preview files in azureus bit torrent download manager?whenever i try to play partially downloaded video files ,it just does not play.limewire and bit comet can preview files,but azureus doesnt seem to do so.is there any software which can help me preview partial downloads? i have azureus 2.4.0.2
can you reveal why this is in the storage forum? i don't see why it's here. bob
sorry for that.i have posted a similar thread in computers section.
