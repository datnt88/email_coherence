<s> i recently replaced the battery on my compaq presario 1500 because it wasn't charging at all (was always at 0%) and needed the adapter to work.  </s>
<s> i bought a replacement battery, put that in and it said it was at 54%.  </s>
<s> i check a few hours later, it's at 56%.  </s>
<s> i repeat trying to charge the battery over the course of a few days and the most it will charge is still only 56% or 59%.  </s>
<s> i leave the computer on with all powersaves off to make sure its charging and same result.  </s>
<s> is it the battery? the adapter? the voltage of my outlet?  </s>
<s> something to do with the contacts?  </s>
<s> how do i either &quot;fix&quot; the battery or the contacts or whatever else is causing this?  </s>
<s> it's either noted in the manual or on their website.  </s>
<s> what you are seeing is normal until you do that.  </s>

<s> i tried the battery calibration, not sure if i did it right, but what i did was use up the battery until it was at 0%, then plugged in the adapter and tried charging it up to 100%. the problem is that after i tried charging it from 0 after plugging back in the adapter, it only got up to 2% and i left the computer on all day.  </s>
<s> but i'd read it again and try again.  </s>
<s> it's a common problem and it's possible you'll sort it out.  </s>
