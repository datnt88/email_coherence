i cant get sound on my pc, it has on board sound but i dont have the requested drivers i think. i have aan award bios. where can i find drivers?
if so, the drivers are on it. otherwise, what company made your computer (hp, compaq, dell, etc) and what's the model number of it? toni
its an acer aspire t620-jb63 and mobo doesnt have a cd
go to acer's site and see if you can find the drivers.
