<s> i set my screen resolution at a setting that my monitor couldn't display.  </s>
<s> now i get a black screen every time i try and turn on my computer.  </s>
<s> i don't get the usual boot up screen either.  </s>
<s> i can boot up when i connect to the motherboard, but not when i use my graphics card. is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution?  </s>
<s> boot safe mode and change the resolution there, then reboot.  </s>
<s> i can't even see the screen that'll let me do this.  </s>
<s> it's just completely black from when i turn on the computer.  </s>
<s> all the pcs i've used for years show a splash screen and could get the bios even with the windows video setting being incorrect.  </s>
<s> safe mode seems to elude new users of windows.  </s>
<s> let's try this again.  </s>
<s> tell me how you tried to get to windows safe mode?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thats the problem.  </s>
<s> im not getting this screen anymore.  </s>
<s> i've actually done this before when i was using a different monitor, and used the &quot;computer wasn't shut down properly&quot; screen to boot into safe mode and change it back.  </s>
<s> this time though i don't get that screen.  </s>
<s> do you think i might have done something to the graphics card?  </s>
<s> could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?  </s>
<s> and no bios screen it does not look like a settings issue.  </s>
<s> it now looks like a pc that needs repair.  </s>
<s> as to the &quot;done something to the graphics card?  </s>
<s> could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?&quot;  </s>
<s> i have yet to encounter that as a cause of a card failure.  </s>
<s> most failures are because of inadequate cooling, failed fan or a bad power supply.  </s>
<s> since there is no bios, splash or other screens the machine should be treated like a dead pc and we begin the repairs by replacing the parts we suspect first.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i can boot up fine using the integrated card, just not the external one.  </s>
<s> i guess it must be the card then.  </s>
<s> i was thinking that maybe changing the resolution could affect the splash screen.  </s>
<s> if not, then i definitely destroyed the card.  </s>
<s> i did mess with the card when it stopped working, and i do have a network card which partially obstructs the airflow from the card's fan.  </s>
<s> i probably screwed it up.  </s>
<s> crud.  </s>
<s> better than a real dead pc since repairs can be costly.  </s>
<s> since the card stops the machine cold i'd keep that card out of the machine before it fries something in the pc. check the card warranty and you may get lucky, bob  </s>
<s> thanks for your help.  </s>
