i recently bought an asus cm1730 windows 7 desktop. it came with an 'installation disk' -- the retailer created a set of 'recovery disks' for it. what is the difference between them? when would i use each of them? do either contain windows? thank you for your help.
my guess would be the asus disk would be what is called a &quot;boot &quot; disk and what the store created were the os disks. you would use these for system failures and only then. the store disks (usually 2 or 3 dvd's) would/should contain the total operating system and would restore the system back to &quot;as new&quot; . the boot disk would be used if the system failed to boot and would/could recover the system from within the system (os). only use these if you need to, store them in a safe location as a just in case.
thank you - your reply clarified my quandary a lot. not to beleaguer it - but - wouldn't the os disks include the boot in?? if (and i hope i never do) need the boot disc -- wouldn't i need to follow it with the os discs? thank you for your help.
