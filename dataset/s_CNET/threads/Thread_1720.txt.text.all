<s> who is going to to replace systemax, in there manufacturing side.  </s>
<s> i work for a company that does the same thing (chipco computers) but we are the fraction of the size of systemax.  </s>
<s> i would love to pick up the business, but there is nobody to turn talk to with all of these online resellers.  </s>
<s> just curious on who these customer that have been with systemax for 25+ years are going to rely on for computers.  </s>
<s> we have recieved a couple calls, but i figured there would be a panic.  </s>
<s> not seeming that way.  </s>
<s> there's not much need to desktops as the move to laptops has been very steady.  </s>
<s> now to tablets!  </s>
<s> i have a buddy that was (and still is!) in the custom desktop pc biz and it's sad to see how small his business has shrunk.  </s>
<s> he eeks out a meager living but it looks to be a single digit per cent of what he did just a decade ago.  </s>
<s> desktops are not a place to explore for new business for most folk.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i agree, hence why so many of these business are collapsing.  </s>
<s> i just feel that there are enough enthusiast out there to keep the pc alive.  </s>
<s> while the facebook stalkers and the news readers love the ease and convenience of tablets and phones.  </s>
<s> i do think that there is a nitch for those who want to see there windows score at 7.9, boot in 8 seconds, stare at there 4 monitors, and fill there 8 terabytes that you can never max out with a pc. also, it is hard to play the new call of duty that is coming out on a tablet.  </s>
<s> lastly the though i have sold hundreds of laptops and tablets to elementary schools for 7 year olds all the way up to universities, i feel that the computer lab needs to stick around as well as the desktops in business. the better way to put this, is though i know desktops are diminishing, i do not see them going away.  </s>
<s> with this being said is there a place for custom whitebox builders or are we going to throw in the towel to dell, hp, and lenovo.  </s>
<s> because frankly they are often not competitive, they use the same parts, does the name dell really make people feel that warm and cozy  </s>
<s> there is still a need for desktops.  </s>
<s> they will become the &quot;workhorse&quot; pc. further, these are more customize able compared to anything else out there.  </s>
<s> laptops and tablets are becoming the connectivity leaders but they lack any real meaty attitude unless you make it that way.  </s>
<s> but, if that's what users want and cost is reasonable thre you have it.  </s>
<s> but, it doesn't matter to me as i fix anything and some old stuff still comes in for repair as that what the customer wants, no ifs, ands, or buts, just make it go again.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
