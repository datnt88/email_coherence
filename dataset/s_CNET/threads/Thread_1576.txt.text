hi everyone... i have a little bit of a problem, im very sorry for the inconvenience if you get this alot but ive tried really after reading other posts on how to successfully set up an ad hoc network... however i have failed. all i really want to do is set up a wlan... no routers no nothing, just to be able to share files between two laptops i just recently bought ( vaio and dell both with internal wireless network cards and wlan) . i would greatly greatly appreciate it if someone could take the time to walk me through the steps one by one please... thanks you.
im sorry i almost forgot... both machines are running xp pro and both do have internal wireless cards
it's part of a demo i setup to demo my software. the one thing that wipes most out is they installed a firewall. but you didn't note it so your issue may be elsewhere. the machines were new so after windows update and installing the antivirus i selected a folder to share, set it to adhoc and rebooted. the other machine i did the same and it asked if i wanted to connect to the adhoc network. very easy and i can't see how a step by step would be needed. but a firewall could squash this. bob
i wonder who installed this os. very few can do a clean install and get it all working. you may not have a network setup issue here. bob
