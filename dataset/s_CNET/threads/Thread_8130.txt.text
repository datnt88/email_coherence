when i put my computer on stand by the fan continues to run. is this normal, or should it stop? i have windows x p
no details i can find to start a discussion but since &quot;xp&quot; knows nothing about what to do with the fan (that's a driver thing) what you asked can be answered with &quot;sounds proper for xp.&quot; if you want to look into if such is possible we'd have to see if the unit has fan controls. most desktops didn't have such. bob
thanks for your reply. do you know how i find out if the unit has fan control anne
and xp is the version released back in 2000. it didn't do much without the service packs and drivers. until more is known about this machine, it could be working properly. bob
i will have to contact the guy i bought it from, as it's not a recognised brand. thanks for your reply
the fans are connected to the computer's power supply. in standby by this power supply is &quot;on&quot; and since the fans are connected to that supply the fans are &quot;on&quot; as well. this is why nothing may be wrong. bob
