ok, so here's my problem. i'm home from school and for some reason or other my laptop will not connect to the internet. i was home for thanksgiving break and it was working fine. it seems to be working fine now, aside from it not connecting to the internet. my wireless signal is as strong as can be and it connects to the router, but when i open ie it wont connect to the internet. does anyone have any idea what could be wrong or how i could fix it?
to the router, then open internet explorer and click on tools and click on online. then try it. if it does not work, try a different browser, to make sure you really are connected. hope this helps. rick
yeah, it says that its connected to the wireless router, i've tried disconnecting and re-connecting but it still says its not connected to the internet. i can't get on aim or anything, but the signal strenght is strong and it says its connected to the wireless router... i dunno?
i think most probably you are not connecting to wireless router, although the signal is strong. check out this link to confirm your wireless adapter configuration:  if still having problem, use ping to troubleshoot the problem.
i had that problem twice with me sony viao. i was using norton antivirus software, somehow a glich would occur in my security settings and block my access to the wireless internet connection. i had to go into norton and change my settings. also if you are running windows xp and those security settings are set to high that might also block you from the internet.
