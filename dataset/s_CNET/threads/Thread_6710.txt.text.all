<s> hi thanks in advance for any help.  </s>
<s> i recently tried to upgrade my dell c521 4gb 32-bit, radeon x1300/1550 graphics card with this: sparkle sx98gt512d3l-nm geforce 9800 gt 512mb 256-bit gddr3 pci express 2.0 x16 hdcp ready low profile ready video card - retail from newegg it was a bit difficult to insatll but i pluged it in and turned on the pc....the button usually green is yellow and only the the fan and dvd drive come on..the pc dosent boot up.  </s>
<s> i was thinking i need to replace the power supply which was 280watt.  </s>
<s> my warranty recently expired and i'd like to avoid paying $50 only to be told to order a power supply.  </s>
<s> thanks -t  </s>
<s> appears to have a separate power connector on the rear side. it needs a direct connection to the power supply in order to work.  </s>
<s> did you see it and plug in the connector?  </s>
<s> yes i did see it but was not clear what pluged into what.  </s>
<s> plus the cords didnt strecth.  </s>
<s> but about the power supply..do you think i need to replace it...is there a &quot;reset&quot; button?  </s>
<s> all my product doc is on the hard drive, so i cant look anything up.  </s>
<s> and it may not have the 6 pin pci express power connector that the video card needs.  </s>
<s> no, there's no reset button.  </s>
<s> you may not have zapped the ps but it's a good bet it's under powered for your system now.  </s>
<s> so you mean i will have replace power supply?  </s>
<s> so then i'll have to replace?  </s>
<s> i don't want to sound rude but, if the answer is &quot;no&quot;, the answer to your question should be obvious.  </s>
<s> if it does have the connector and you haven't plugged it in, the next step to take is also obvious.  </s>
<s> that's all i can offer.  </s>
<s> best of luck.  </s>
<s> sorry i wasnt clear....i actually pluged in the video card turned on the pc and it ran bu didnot boot up.  </s>
<s> seconds later i kind of smell a burning smell and tuned it off. the smell was comming from the power supply.  </s>
<s> i tried to turn it on and and then the fan would only start, and dvd drive.  </s>
<s> so this is why i'm thinking the power supply?  </s>
