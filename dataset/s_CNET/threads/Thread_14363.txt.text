i wanted to reformat my western digital 250 gb hard drive. it says the file system is a fat32 right now. but when im about to reformat it, it only gives me the option to format it in ntfs. so will it my hard drive break or somthing if i reformat it in ntfs. cause i wanna know how to just reformat it in fat32.
if you're running xp, the drive should be formatted in ntfs.
ok so i have a windows xp pro, so i just format it in ntfs and it'll still work?
make sure you have any files you wanted to keep backed up because if you format the drive, anything on it will be lost.
xp (all versions) use the nt file system (ntfs). it's much more stable than the old dos based fat32.
