<s> i wanted to know if its possible to take a hard drive from one computer and place on another and still retain all the information on it  </s>
<s> in short, the answer is yes.  </s>
<s> but the longer answer would need to ask just what you planning for the move.  </s>
<s> if you expect everything to work as it did in the old computer, then no. the information will still be there but the os will not accept the move as if it did not happen.  </s>
<s> so, just what do you expect and why?  </s>
<s> just one more question: what are os you are trying to transfer data from/to?  </s>
<s> your data will still be there but the drive will probably not boot.  </s>
<s> you will not be able to say &quot;oops&quot; and put it back in the old machine and have it work as before.  </s>
<s> why?  </s>
<s> i don't know how xp does it but it puts something on that drive to mark the installation as illegal.  </s>
<s> you get to sort that out with microsoft to get it working again.  </s>
<s> what i want to recover is some pictures and songs...but most importantly some pictures i took on a vacation and i didnt back them up on a cd.  </s>
