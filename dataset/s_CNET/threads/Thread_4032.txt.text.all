<s> i have an nec nd-2510a dual layer burner with a bundled oem copy of nero 6.3.0.5.  </s>
<s> i have used both to burn mp3 music discs but i can't find any reference to burning dual layer discs.  </s>
<s> can anyoen help?  </s>
<s> it's fairly simple.  </s>
<s> such menus pop up if you put in dual layer dvd media.  </s>
<s> you get 9+gb reported as the disk size.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you say you have a nero oem.  </s>
<s> version sounds like it is the latest.  </s>
<s> i would still go to nero and get latest updates.  </s>
<s> might be same version(or later), but more complete.  </s>
<s> mine was.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> chuck  </s>
<s> thank's chaps, that solves my problem.  </s>
<s> i will also try for an update.  </s>
<s> nero would not let me update from version 5 to 6 and i would think that it will not let me update an oem version but it is worth a try.  </s>
