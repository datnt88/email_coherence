<s> would a ''dvd burner'' such as the be able to read any type of media and data?  </s>
<s> i want to be able to use the drive as a regular, cd-rom game-playing and software-installing drive, a drive which would play music cds and be able to burn them as well.  </s>
<s> and can you use dvd-r discs such as to burn music files and play them in stereos and your computer?  </s>
<s> dvd-rw drives function exactly like any cd drive. the burners just do more.  </s>
<s> good price btw.  </s>
<s> media?  </s>
<s> stick with name brands.  </s>
<s> one problem may be with dvd movies that you may create may not play in a standard dvd player.  </s>

<s> but can those cds be burned with music?  </s>
<s> music that i can play on the stereo, cd player and the computer?  </s>
<s> its strange because those cds are 4+ gb, while traditional music cds are 700 mb. how many minutes would those 4+ gb cds hold in music (if they burn music, that is)?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> so these drives are also burners, right?  </s>
<s> standard cd's and 80 minute cd's for music.  </s>
<s> simply look at the link that you sent for the drive.  </s>
<s> look closely at the top line, it lists all of the things that the drive will read, will burn, and gives the max speed of each.  </s>
<s> a year or so ago that drive would have been $150.  </s>
<s> that it also burns dual layer dvd's. the blank media is rather expensive, over $3 per disk and may have many compatibily with other readers.  </s>
<s> &gt; its strange because those cds are 4+ gb, &gt; while traditional music cds are 700 mb. that's because they're not cd's.  </s>
<s> they're dvd's.  </s>
<s> they may look the same, and even work somewhat the same, but they're not the same.  </s>
<s> i never thought about trying to put cd-type audio on a dvd until you brought it up, but according to what i just read, that won't work.  </s>
<s> there are audio dvd's, but apparently the format is different, so you can't just copy the audio from cd's to a dvd.  </s>
<s> even if that's true, there's probably a way around that (a conversion process or something).  </s>
<s> but if you create an audio dvd, a regular cd player wouldn't be able to play it, because a dvd is just different.  </s>
<s> a cd drive (cd player, cd-rom or cd-rw) just can't read a dvd disc.  </s>
<s> you may be able to play it on a dvd player or a dvd drive in a computer, but that may depend on the format of the audio, dvd, etc. as for how many minutes of audio a dvd would hold, for cd quality audio you can just &quot;do the math&quot;.  </s>

<s> scripts threads 80 minutes on a cd. that should give you an approximation, assuming that you can put cd quality audio on a dvd.  </s>
<s> you might also be able to (or have to) use higher quality audio (like the audio dvd's that are out now with enhanced audio), which would decrease the amount of audio you could fit on a disc.  </s>
<s> it seems like you don't know much about dvd's, in which case you might try the faq at: there's a lot of info there, but you could start by looking at specific questions that are of interest to you, like &quot;[1.1]  </s>

<s> &gt; i want to be able to use the drive as &gt; a regular, cd-rom game-playing and &gt; software-installing drive, a drive which &gt; would play music cds and be able to burn &gt; them as well.  </s>
<s> theoretically you can do all that, but ... 1) copy-protected cd's (like those used for some games) seem to work best in cd-rom drives.  </s>
<s> sometimes other types of drive can have problems reading those cd's correctly.  </s>
<s> i don't know if dvd-rw drives ever have that kind of problem.  </s>
<s> iac, i wouldn't worry about it too much at this point.  </s>
<s> it's just something to be aware of.  </s>
<s> if you ever have trouble installing or running copy-protected software from a dvd-rw drive, that might be the problem, in which case i'd suggest trying a cd-rom drive instead.  </s>
<s> 2) regular audio cd's should play just fine, but you may have trouble playing a dual disc (cd on one side and dvd on the other).  </s>
<s> i had a lot of trouble getting my dvd-rom drive to recognize the cd side of a dual disc i bought recently.  </s>
<s> it didn't even see that a disc was loaded.  </s>
<s> some research on the 'net showed that this was not an uncommon problem.  </s>
<s> after putting the disc in probably 5 - 10 times the dvd-rom drive finally recognized it.  </s>
<s> a dvd-rw drive might have similar problems.  </s>
<s> i don't know.  </s>
<s> again, just something to be aware of.  </s>
