i just inherited a pc running xp. only problem is, when the the pc boots it gets as far as the black xp 'loading' screen, then re-starts. so far i have tried swapping out the hard drive for a known good one. still get the same result. new motherboard require? any suggestions?? cheers.
with just what you've provided in the way of information, there isn't much to discuss. with each post, this passage appears. &quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; consider it as a good idea to tell all that others may need to know to help you out. bob
yes, a good suggestion. here's the spec: a packard bell ixtreme 9200 i package containing: p3 1ghz, 128mb sdram, 40gb udma hdd, creative sb live, geforce 2 mx 32mb. as far as i know all of these are the proginal compoenets and have hot been upgraded/changed etc. the problem has only recently occurred, so i'm guessing that one of the components has had it. based on my very limited knowledge, i'm guessing perhaps the motherboard, or possibly the power supply. just wondering if anyones encountered a simlar problem. thanks
remember that i rarely am shown a working machine. even with what you've noted, any one of the items on the list can fail and cause the reboot. and without any story to give wieght to any specific software issue, i still think there's more to be told. here's something to try. safe mode. what happens? bob
review these links: computer stops responding with a black screen when you start windows resources for troubleshooting startup problems in windows xp
just a suggestion: i've heard that bad power supplies can cause reboots (as well as viruses), if you have a spare you might give it a try. ciao
