<s> i have a dell dimm 4700 windows7 p4 2.8 4gb bios a06 believe it has a agp radeon x300/x550/x1050 in it don't want to spend alot, fry anything, nor do any big time gaming.  </s>
<s> my question is; what is a decent cheap low power option, and will i see any difference (will it help at all) thanks!  </s>
<s> 300 watts  </s>
<s> not much choices at such a low psu.  </s>
<s> we can't be sure how many spare watts are available for the new card.  </s>
<s> yes the old card is sadly unknown so we have to guess a little and hope that the usual pcie gt220 1gb card will do fine.  </s>
<s> here the total power draw from my kid's hp d5000t is at 100 watts when gaming so it should be fine.  </s>
<s> look for them on amazon, newegg and such sites.  </s>
<s> example at there are far too many dimension models so be sure yours has a full height pcie slot.  </s>

<s> my video card is the old agp style (not pci) i don't believe i am pulling to many watts, although i may repalce the psu in the future, maybe at the same time i have been looking for an agp that can do windows 7 anyway, my main question is will i see any big difference for everyday computing (surfing / email) or is the video card really just for gaming?  </s>
<s> i may do some basic video rediting (cam corder family movies), does it help this?  </s>
<s> for video editing, playback even the old fx6200 is ok. i won't write again about what a video card does but today we have gaming and we have aero and then the rest.  </s>
<s> since you just need the basics without gaming let's find some agp card that's not bottom of the barrel without a big power draw.  </s>
<s> how about read the comments and you find folk do use this on windows 7. bob  </s>
<s> agp and windows 7 is the tough part i found ati radeon hd3450 512mb gddr2 agp 8x windows 7 capatible, does say 64 bit mem bus, my sys is 32 bit does that matter?  </s>
<s> only calls for a 250 psu but, it's $65, about 20 more than i wanted (beggars can't be choosy!) thanks all, will i see a big diffrence visually?  </s>
<s> or is it more the abuility to do things faster etc just tryiong to upgrade a dinosaur for under a hundred and fifty bucks maxed out ram and bigger hd for $90, and wanted a card for about 40 is upgrading the power supply only for the vid card, is there any other reason to??  </s>
<s> the 3450 ain't bad but you are pushing your luck on power.  </s>
<s> i know that card and it's more juice than the 6200.  </s>
<s> and no to the agp or gpu data bus width.  </s>
<s> that has nothing to do with the os. as to the visual question i can bet no. but then again some may pick out this or that to be a flaw.  </s>
<s> i can't tell.  </s>
