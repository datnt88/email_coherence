my buisness has 8 hardwired computers, 2 wireless computers and a server to connect together. currently we have an 8 port switch: netgear g5608 and a wireless access point: netgear wg602 v3, to connect all together. does anyone have any suggestions for an update to these two? i'm trying to combine it all into one, making it easier to maintain.
modem -&gt; router -&gt; switch -&gt; computers. the router must be in front of the switch as the router assigns ip addresses to each device. the wireless devices communicate with the router. run the network setup wizard on each machine and turn on file and printer sharing on all devices. assign a network name to be used by all devices. use wpa(2) for your wireless security. done.
from the description wouldn't simply getting a router with the necessary lan ports and a wireless capability be easier? then configure the router as a bridge/switch. it sounds from the description as though the server is a dhcp server, and could also be a file server. there isn't enough information yet to make a real suggestion.
we have a modem -&gt; coolpix firewall -&gt; file/dhcp server -&gt; netgear g5608 switch -&gt; netgear wg602 v3 access point is there a router with 8 ports and wireless?
after checking around, there doesn't seem to be any wired/wireless combination with 8 ports. 5 ports yes, but none with 8. you seem to have the optimal hardware setup.
ok, thanks.
