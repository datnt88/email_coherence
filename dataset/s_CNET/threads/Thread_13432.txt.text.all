<s> hello all, i'm relatively new here and this is my first post, so please forgive me for any newbie errors.  </s>
<s> anyway, i'm upgrading from an athlon xp 1900 to an athlon 64 3000.  </s>
<s> i've bought a mb/cpu/ram combo and it will be arriving wednesday.  </s>
<s> my question is this, when i go to install this new mb setup, can i just plug in my existing hdd's and keep going?  </s>
<s> or will doing so cause many many many many headaches that will make me go bananas?  </s>
<s> if so, how do i circumvent this?  </s>
<s> also, if there is a webpage out there on the 'net that shows a step-by-step upgrade procedure such as this, would you mind pointing me in that direction?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> pedo...  </s>
<s> since no operating system (os) is listed, i think it should just plug in and work.  </s>
<s> if an os is noted, then post this in an os forum.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'm running xp home.  </s>
<s> i posted in the os forum, but have yet to receive a response.  </s>
<s> try i'm sure someone will answer it again, but this is a volunteer forum and answers appear from minutes to days later.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> found it, thanks...  </s>
