need a recommendation for an external hard drive so i can download my computer info for backup in case my hard drive goes. i have about 750mb already on my hard drive so i need at least 1tb of storage.
so you want to back up from a hard drive that might fail to a hard drive that might fail? think about it.
then what do you suggest i use to backup my computer files, photos, and music
store about 40g. which i think should be a little more reliable.
