<s> hi, i recently got a toshiba satellite e105 laptop and i was wondering how to wipe my hard drive absolutely clean of everything (including os and partitions) and start over, installing my windows 7 rc dvd onto a 2 gb (or so) partition and leaving the rest of the hard drive's space on a second partition, assuming that's a wise way to set up a hard drive...? i already tried installing w7 rc only to find that there was already an oem reserved partition where vista is, so i was only able to install w7 rc on the larger of the two partitions, and i'm pleased to report that w7 seems great, but i'd like to re-install it onto a cleaned-up hard drive that doesn't have a big windows.old  </s>
<s> folder taking up a bunch of space.  </s>
<s> so could you tell me how to set my hard drive up that way for my next attempt at a w7 rc installation?  </s>
<s> so to summarize, i first want to completely wipe my hard drive clean, which currently contains two separate partitions: one small oem-created vista partition and the main one now containing w7 rc. from there, i want to set my hard drive up with one small partition i can install w7 rc on and another main one for storage and stuff, unless you hard drive experts think it's wiser to set a laptop up differently... also, as a side question, could you tell me if a hard drive backup image includes everything like partitioning, etc, or if it only contains the os, software, data, and things like that?  </s>
<s> because i should probably make a backup image before doing anything drastic.  </s>
<s> thanks for your time!  </s>
<s> read and tell me how you would get it to fit.  </s>
