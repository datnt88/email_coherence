hi folks. my wireless conection has always been trouble free. but from yesterday my laptop cannot find my wireless network. here's the odd bit - whenever i turn off the mains power supply it finds it and conects wirelessly! then when i turn the mains back on it loses it. what the ????????
many routers will need a firmware upgrade before they act correctly again.
sorry - english! by the mains i mean the power supply/socket in the wall. i'm in the uk so we have 220v which connects to the laptop via an ac adapter. btw, the other laptop in the house stil works fine, its just this one.
think i might have solved it. my laptop has some power management software on it - i reset this to default and problem seems to have gone.
