i have an external drive which i bought with a notebook 8 years ago; connects via ieee-1394 and worked great for many years. last year i bought a new pc with xp. it had no ieee ports, so i bought and installed a card. worked great for getting all the old stuff into the new pc. since the new pc has lots of space, i put away the ext. drive for several months after the new machine was set up. now i have a use for the ext. drive again, but xp will no longer recognize it. i even ran the &quot;helper cd&quot; and tried restarting with the drive on, have tried all the ports, and nothing -- xp cannot or will not find or detect the ext. drive. what happened? is there any trick i can try in order to be able to use the ext. drive again? also, is there such a thing as a simple and reliable ieee-1394/usb adapter?
no there is no such usb to ieee 1393 device. yes, there is a call for such a thing but if you do your research you find out why there is none. for very little you can put the hard drive into some usb enclosure (less than the cost of that firewire adapter?) and get it done. bob
qucik checks... verify in the bios that 1394 port(s) are on/enabled. under the device mgr. in h/w that if any red/yellow flag next to 1394 port it needs attention. if error posted, google the error for a fix. what robert suggests pretty much covers the rest of your problem. while there maybe a s/w glitch, it could quite possibility be the result of esd damage. the handling of ext. devices then to ext. port can blowout the port(static discharge). tada -----willy
