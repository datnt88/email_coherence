<s> hi, everyone: i'm in the market for a tablet.  </s>
<s> one i like a lot is the asus transformer.  </s>
<s> as far as i can tell, the only thing it lacks is 3g, so i'm thinking about getting &quot;broadband to go&quot; from virgin mobile, which includes a 3g modem, i think, if i'm reading it right.  </s>
<s> i have a virgin mobile cell phone, and really like it and the company.  </s>
<s> here's the scoop on the tab: asus eee pad transformer (tf101-a1) tablet nvidia tegra 2 10.1&quot; wide svga 1gb ddr2 memory 16gb flash hdd nvidia ulp geforce here's a link to it: this thing has an excellent array of features... the virgin mobile broadband is super cheap at $10 for 10 days or $20 for a month, and is pay-as-you go, which is great b/c i'll probably only use the tablet when we're travelling.  </s>
<s> it includes a usb &quot;device,&quot; which i'm assuming is a modem.  </s>
<s> here's a link to virgin: i'm a freelance writer, not a power user , so i want the tab just for checking email, getting driving directions, etc., and, of course, as a new toy to take to the supermarket with my grocery list.  </s>
<s> can anyone say if this hardware configuration seems like it would work?  </s>
<s> or suggest a solution for me that would be about $300?  </s>
<s> for &quot;serious&quot; work, i have a nice hp laptop.  </s>
<s> also, is it possible to link up a tablet like this one to my laptop older hp nc6000 laptop, just for fun?  </s>
<s> comments would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> i'm really kind of overwhelmed by all the information and reviews out there.  </s>
<s> my budget is about $300 to maybe $400, not including the monthly broadband charge.  </s>
<s> tia jaina  </s>
<s> but i found a gps to work better at that so i have a gps.  </s>
<s> as to writing i see folk add a keyboard since, well, i guess many haven't used a touchscreen for writing long enough to see if they can make that leap.  </s>
<s> i went back to scraps of paper for shopping.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> unfortunately, the asus doesn't have usb ports, which i definitely want, b/c i need usb for mobile broadband.  </s>
<s> so, it's out.  </s>
<s> i ended up buying a &quot;superpad&quot; on amazon for $199, more as an experiment as anything.  </s>
<s> it got mixed reviews, but i thought, what the heck :-)can always send it back.  </s>
<s> thx j  </s>
<s> at least the units i tried (all 2). the reason is well discussed so let's move to what works.  </s>
<s> bluetooth tethering.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> jaina, so did the tablet work with the virgin broadband?  </s>
<s> i have had virgin mobile broadband for quite a while now and am looking for a tablet that would let me use both.  </s>
<s> please, let me know.  </s>
<s> thanks janja  </s>
<s> this one -&gt; will work fine.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i actually have the broadband2go which is the usb stick.  </s>
<s> its not a hotspot but a wireless modem.  </s>
<s> i called virgin mobile yesterday and they said that the stick only works with windws os, which is a bummer since all of those are very expensive.  </s>
<s> i wonder, if you can change the os on the tablets?  </s>
<s> the tablet above does not have windows available.  </s>
