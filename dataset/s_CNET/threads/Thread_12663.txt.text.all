<s> i had done that at one time but am having difficulty after replacing router #1 (the one connected to the dsl modem).  </s>
<s> now with the new router, router #2 does not allow connectivity to the internet.  </s>
<s> i am looking for the proper device to connect to one of the router ports.  </s>
<s> thanks,  </s>
<s> you have dsl so your router 1 logs into the dsl via pppoe.  </s>
<s> i don't need that since i'm on cable.  </s>
<s> so adjust as you see fit.  </s>
<s> but i did have to make sure the lan on router one was not the same ip range as router two.  </s>
<s> i used 192.168.1.x for router 1 and 192.168.2.x for ... besides that, it's just the default settings.  </s>
<s> &quot;i am looking for the proper device to connect to one of the router ports&quot; that would be a wifi router or wap.  </s>
<s> today, the wifi router is the cheap solution.  </s>
