3898	0	597929	5480787	nr	heehee62	7/25/13 4:50 pm	1.374771e12	why does my router keep disabling itself?	have a belkin play n600 router with tomato v 1.28 on it. both the 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when i use them and then completely disable completely (both bands disable at same time even when i'm using just one). to get back online, i have to either turn on/off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato gui. what's going on?

3898	6	597929	5481030	5481004	r. proffitt	7/26/13 9:55 am	1.3748325e12	that's a good sign	that the router hardware is in good to fair shape. long ago ddns was not done on a router so i'm left to guess you wanted it on the router. but fast forward to today i no longer need ddns as i solved my need in new ways. bob
