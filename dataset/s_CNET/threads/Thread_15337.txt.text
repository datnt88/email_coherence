new to this wireless thing...our local cable company helped me set up the security part....not sure what info you need, but something happened he couldn't figure out.... i was unsecured for a few weeks...called them up..now my internet connection is secured, but i can only get on if im hooked up (ethernet)..if i'm wireless, the pop-up immediately shows indicating it cant connect..no asking for my key or anything..but if i try to connect to a neighbors secure...the key question does come on.... its also interesting that i can connect to another neighbor's unsecured network, but not my own...any thoughts would be appreciated.
... so you have been able to connect wirelessly via your own network when you were unsecured ? what does the pop-up say ? thought: the access point or wireless router is probably not configured properly to allow you to access your own now secured network wirelessly. (whetehr ssid is broadcast, whether wireless enabled, security mode...)
can you see your network? no: ssid broadcast is turned off, wireless is disabled, check the antena yes: dhcp is disabled (i think) in any case you need to configure your router make sure you're connected (ethernet) start-&gt;run 'cmd' type in ipconfig /all and there should be 'default gateway' ip under ethernet lan (usually 192.168.0.1) type that in your browser (you'll be asked username and password for your router)
