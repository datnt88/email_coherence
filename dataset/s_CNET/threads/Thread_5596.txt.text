have a dell dimension 3000, running xp and have a ms pacman game installed. using the keyboard is kind of a pita. a joystick would be easier. i have a couple of usb ports available. can i just get a plug and play joystick? where do you suggest i find one? does anyone even use a joystick anymore? i feel old fashioned by even asking the question. but i know my 5 year old (and i too) would be happy playing the game with a joystick. thanks. ed.
a really good joy stick for not a lot of money, logitech wingman or logitech extreme, either one.
hey thanks.....will be at the mall game store today.
