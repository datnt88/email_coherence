4300	2	294000	2767770	2767389	nascar4num9	5/7/08 8:59 pm	1.21019394e12	sorry, i should have been clearer	i really need suggestions on a new motherboard and processors that would go along with my existing sata hd, graphics card, and ram. my range is about 500 to 600? possibly a motherboard / processor package? thanks, nascar4num9
4300	3	294000	2768556	2767770	ramarc	5/8/08 10:20 am	1.210242e12	i'd start from scratch	if you proceed with this &quot;upgrade&quot;, you'll wind up with a pc that's still behind the curve. anyway, here's an agp based mobo for $70:  and a core2duo 2.4ghz e4600 for $120:  since you're willing to spend some money, start from scratch: core2duo 3.0ghz e8400, $180:  4gb ddr2-800, $85:  ecs 9600gt/512mb, $147:  gigabyte p35 mobo, $82:  about $500 gets you a top-performing pc.

4300	5	294000	2769336	2768556	nascar4num9	5/9/08 5:27 am	1.21031082e12	what about the case	is the case up to date to fit all new motherboards? atx..i assume so?
4300	6	294000	2769570	2769335	ramarc	5/9/08 9:31 am	1.21032546e12	yes your sata drive will work	and the 9600gt is the best bang-for-the-buck video card. if you add a new case and power supply like the antec sonata iii below for $100, you can try to sell your old pc for $150 or get a $400 tax deduction by donating it to charity.
4300	7	294000	2779113	2769336	nascar4num9	5/22/08 9:00 pm	1.21149e12	still need help	ok...i was able to get this old box working and install a new hard drive. news is that due to its age, my new arca sim racing game will not work....so...im going to take the challenge on. im not that up with all the hardware stuff. the gentelman that suggested the things above i think are excellent suggestions. what if i wanted to put say another 600 bucks in the deal? that would total out to 1,100? if you were in my situation, what setup would you get? also, will my existing case support the new mobo? thanks, nascar4num9
