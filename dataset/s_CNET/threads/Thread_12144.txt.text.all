<s> i want to keep my current landline phone as is for the moment.  </s>
<s> i am also looking at buying for my mother a skype phone where no pc is required so she can talk to her sister in uk anytime if she gets a similar set up.  </s>
<s> not sure how these work but assume you only need a phone line socket.  </s>
