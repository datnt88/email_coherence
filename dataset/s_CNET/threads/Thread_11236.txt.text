i am currently using an ati 9250 rad 256 card(pci) for video. i have a linksys 10/100 network card. what would be the point of upgrading to an agp 4x or 8x or a 16x pcie card? i am wondering if my network card would even support the bandwidth that these cards supply. during ftp i can get up to 3.5 megs a sec but if what i am reading is correct my pci video card will deliver up to 120 something megs a sec. so what is the point of getting a more powerful card that will deliver 2 to 4 gigs a sec if my network doesnt (?) support that rate of transfer? i am currently on a cable modem not a t1 line but am confused at this point as to what is the point of the higher end agp and pci cards. mainly i am curious about multi player games and the i know that i am missing some basic facts but cant seem to find a relevant source online that points me in the right direction. any help would be appreciated. z
5th tech site and no one responds. am i just a total newb or is it a question that cant be answered?????
but in short, the faster the tranfer rate, then the less time lost for the cpu to not have access to ram or i/o. even a few millisecond wait by the cpu is some million cycles lost. bob
