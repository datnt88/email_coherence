<s> i am buying a macbook pro with a ss hard drive (which is small), it has the nvidia 1gb graphics card.  </s>
<s> i want to play many video games which require windows, but most of these games take up quite a bit of space so i do not want to run bootcamp on the mac ss. is it possible to take an external hard drive format the entire thing as a windows 7 system and run this hard drive as an alternate with my computer for the use of video games?  </s>
<s> also, i have usb 3.0 so it seems this would be the best connection for speed and price, am i right in thinking this?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance  </s>
<s> you can't install windows on a removable drive.  </s>
<s> but you can install it on the ssd under bootcamp, and then (if the installer of the game allows it) install the games on the external.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> i don't see any system or procedure to do what you asked.  </s>
<s> so i was reading up on using bootcamp.  </s>
<s> do many games require a c: drive install anymore or will external be fine.  </s>
<s> also, is usb 3.0 a fast enough connection for playing games?  </s>
<s> sorry for the remedial questions it has been a while since i have done stuff with computer games.  </s>
<s> only the gamer can answer that.  </s>
<s> all the games i've seen run off some usb 2.0 do run fine.  </s>
<s> there are delays in loading maps, or the game but they do run.  </s>
<s> but then you have that gamer that won't accept any delay.  </s>
