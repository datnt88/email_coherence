not sure where to post this question. anyway i've been looking at the edirect web site & their prices are so low it seems like i could have problems. prices like win xp pro just $ 79.00 winfax pro just 17.99 this question is not an advertisement for a web site as i am a regular cnet. eggman
i've seen winfax at stores for 20 bucks so that's possible. the other is too low to be the real thing. don't feed the pirates. bob
$146 there, and that's oem either their having a huge sale or it's a scam (a sale is possible, but not likely as most other sites would compete with that)
