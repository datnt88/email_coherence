i have bought a galaxy tablet in korea while i was there on a visit and it has the google android 3.1 korean system on it, my question is is there anyway to get it converted to google android 3.1 american?
use google.com and find the nexus support pages. bob
i don't have the korean version so i can't check this. bob
