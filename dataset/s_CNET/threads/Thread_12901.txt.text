i own a samsung galaxy w. recently i thought of buying a tablet. im puzzled. still unable to decide whether to get ipad mini or samsung galaxy tab 2. reason for the tablet is to be used in classes and reading notes and for ebooks etc as im a university student. any suggestions?
i see no reason to limit myself to that. i don't have that model but the transformer tf300, nexus 7 and a dozen others. all do ebooks and can read notes. bob
try this offer i think is best low-priced tablet.
-1 for that.
