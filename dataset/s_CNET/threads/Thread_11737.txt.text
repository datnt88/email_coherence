i just purchased a linksys srx router , and i have an old dell true mobile router. is it possible to extend my network using my old router as a repeater.
with two linksys routers by turning off dhcp, nat and changing from gateway to router on the remote router. of course the remote router was hard wired to a switch in the upstairs closet.
?
will be the access point, hard wire a pc to it and enter it's web based setup program. from here you have to see where the settings are that i referred to. if you mentioned the routers model numbers, further research can be done but until then i would be guessing.
on which do i have to change the settings. and do i need two separate ssids
truemobile as the ap and use the linksys as the gateway. only one ssid for this network.
