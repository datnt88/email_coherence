if a motherboard, such as my gigabyte ga-6bxc, has settings to allow a maximum of fsb 133mhz and clock ratio of up to 9.5 will the board support processors up to 133x9.5? my ga-6bxc manual says it will only support a fsb up to 100mhz, but does not state a max clock ratio for the speed, will it support a 950mhz cpu? the latest bios update gives support for a celeron 733 but no pentium is noted. please help, i'm looking to upgrade the processor.
had the multiplier locked. no matter if the mobo had jumpers to set a multiplier, the cpu simply ignored it. the availability to modify the multiplier only came back about in the last year. in most of them they are top locked but one could elect a lower multiplier. overclockers did this and then overclocked the memory buss and overall got improved processing speed. what cpu are you running in it at this time???
also, you should see what the motherboard maker's website lists for compatible cpus. if you try something not on the list, then it's your experiment... bob
