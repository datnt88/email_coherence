<s> i have one ethernet cable coming into a room but i have a pc and and xbox 360 that i need to get online.  </s>
<s> does anyone make a splitter to divide the one cable? is it even possible?  </s>
<s> running another cable from the router can't be done, no room left.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> since the cable comes from a router, a simple switched hub should be fine.  </s>
<s> i know there is a splitter but that's not what you want.  </s>

<s> i got a d-link, plugged it in and both were online.  </s>
