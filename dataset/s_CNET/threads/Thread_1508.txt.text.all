<s> hello, i have a network which shares the resources of my imac with other computers around my home.  </s>
<s> this is done through the mac's airport 802.11b card.  </s>
<s> as you may know, its range is limited and i wish to extend it.  </s>
<s> i have an airport express and base station unit but i don't know how to configure them to extend the range of my network.  </s>
<s> many thanks.  </s>
<s> linksys makes a nice range externder.  </s>
<s> i like it since you plug it in the wall socket and .... push the button to make it work.  </s>
<s> no manual to read.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> 1. read the manual, it have enough information... or go their website.  </s>
<s> 2. plug in your airport express to the electrical outlet.. 3. run the airport express assistant... choose connect to existing network... that's it ..  </s>
<s> hi melati, when i plug in the airport express unit i always get the flashing yellow light which means that its out of range or something's not right.  </s>
<s> anyway when i run the airport express assistant it says that it can't find an existing network.  </s>
<s> this is weird since on my pc there clearly is a network yet it doesn't show up on the mac.  </s>
<s> i'm puzzled as the manual is no help at all.  </s>
<s> ta.  </s>
<s> press the small button for a few secong 'while' pluging in into the power.  </s>
<s> then try to connect the ae to the router using a cable(rj45).. then run the ae assistant .. and choose connect to existing network... then turn it off and disconnect the cable... then turn it on and try... better yet look at this discussion: good luck  </s>
