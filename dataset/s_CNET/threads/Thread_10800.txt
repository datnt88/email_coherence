(pc66 pc100?) what size hard drive? except, you'll need different mobo drivers for win98 or winxp (if it's fast enough). i suspect the mobo went south because it doesn't read properly, if you are correct. win2k drivers for modem-sound might be twitchy to find, as well as software. is it fat32 or ntfs? what do you mean by backup?
