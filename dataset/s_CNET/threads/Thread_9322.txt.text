i am running win-xp-sp2 os. i have a lg model gsa-h55n 16x dvd reader/writer. when i burn some movie files, i get &quot;break-ups&quot; during the last 2-3 minutes when i play it back on my home dvd players (plays ok on my pc). i have tried nero, imgburn, dvd shrink,magic dvd copier burning software, but still have this problem (not on every file burned). i use good quality media (memorex,magnavox,hp, etc). i burn at slow speeds (2.5x). i just can't figure out what is wrong. my burner hardware is less than a year old. i would appreciate your comments and/or suggestions. ray
if so, you want to try a newer model of player.
bob: thanks for your timely reply!i have the problem playing the dvd movie with my rca tv/dvd player,as well as my magnavox vhs/dvd, phillips vhs/dvd, and ge dvd player playing through tv. again, it doesn't happen with every movie i burn. sometimes the movie will play ok, but will exhibit the problem the next time i try to play it.
try the other type of dvd media. if you used dvd-r try dvd+r. also, burn the media at 1/2 the media speed or 1/2 the drive speed, whichever is lower to get the best results. i'll share i gifted 2 players because of this issue and replaced it with a philips dvd divx capable player. that one lists dvdr media so there is no question about support. bob
bob: thanks for the suggestion. i have been using dvd+r; will try dvd-r. the media speed is listed as 16x, so i should brun at 8x? i already burn at 2.5x; would 8x produce better results? thanks, ray
good luck.
bob: thanks for reply. will try dvd-r. many thanks! ray
