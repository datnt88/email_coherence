hi let me explain my scenario. i have two laptops. one which has windows xp and connects to internet pppoe dialup using isp name. it has wifi also. another laptop with windows7 and wifi. now from this laptop i would like connect to internet wireless through my windows-xp laptop. i have a query, can i connect to internet from my windows xp laptop with out have unplug connection and swith to other laptop.
that's called ics (internet connection sharing) and it's full of problems. if i were you i would contact the isp and ask what pppoe modem he recommends to use in stead of the current setup. then connect a wireless router (or - even easier - use a modem/router combined) to communicate wirelessly with both laptops. kees
look at  ics is too much trouble for me. i won't do more than note it and move on.
my recommendation is to take the windows 7 laptop and connect the modem to the laptop and put a wireless router onto the laptop. i would recommend you do this with the windows 7 laptop as it will be able to keep up with the xp laptop but not the other way around. next you attach the xp laptop to the win 7 laptop, the wireless router should automatically discover and configure the connection for you and you should not have to do anything.
