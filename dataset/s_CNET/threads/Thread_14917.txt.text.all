<s> hello, i am wanting to upgrade my video card from a nvidia 8300 gs 128 mb to a card that is good enough to play half-life 2 episode 2 and above.  </s>
<s> left4dead2 demo did not play that well either.  </s>
<s> i have a 300 watt power supply, and some claim that the radeon 4650 , and 4670 will work?  </s>
<s> i have had others claim that i need to get a (uhm.. crappy) 8500 gt nvidia ?  </s>
<s> then there are others that say i need to upgrade my power supply before i even think about getting any upgrades?  </s>
<s> any more ideas?  </s>
<s> and it was too much for a 350 watt supply so without doubt your card will not be happy with 300.  </s>

<s> should i try to get a nvidia 9400 gt? nvidia's &quot;help me select&quot; said it was able to be used in a 300 watt.  </s>
<s> i have the 9500 gt in pci form and total watts (i use a watt meter) for the entire machine tops out at 120 watts.  </s>
<s> i know that sounds confusing since some may hit the wrong button and read 120vac but i know the diff. the 9400 is not a screamer but the 8400 pci card in a machine that had no psu upgrade is running fine.  </s>
