<s> hello all just wondering whether anyone could recommend a decent 2.1 speaker system or even a real good 2.0 system for my computer - not an expert in this field so any advice would be well appreciated!  </s>

<s> threads i did like the harman kardon soundsticks, and was originally going to go with them (from the great reviews i have read, as well as a great design) but decided against it as i read it does not have a switch to turn it off (waste of electricity - lol) and dont want it to glow whilst i am trying to sleep - need darkness!!! fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh  </s>
<s> threads a speaker system which is great value and will hopefully last a few years!!! and advice/recs/help of any sort will be very well appreciated!  </s>

<s> hi phil and thanks for your response!  </s>

<s> does anyone have any reccs?  </s>
<s> what are people experiences of the z-4s?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance!  </s>
