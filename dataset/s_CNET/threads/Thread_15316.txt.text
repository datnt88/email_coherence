if i want to add memory, does it have to be in the same increments as what i already have? ie, if i have 3 x 512 mb sticks installed and i want to put a forth stick in does it have to be another 512 mb or can i put in any size, say a 2 gb? the type is ddr2 at 533mhz and i'm running windows vista.
it must be another 512 stick...
type speed density, etc., where possible. your mb manual should give you some good info...take a look. vapcmd
