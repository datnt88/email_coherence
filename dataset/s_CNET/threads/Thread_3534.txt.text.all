<s> i got a new dell inspirion 9300 and it has intel centrino mobile technology and has a wireless internet card.  </s>
<s> but i dont pick up any signals because i am in a military base and i was wondering how to set up a internet router on my laptop without a pc.  </s>
<s> you have the hardware, do you have the internet provider to connect to?  </s>
<s> if you don't have one, then how do you expect to browse the internet?  </s>
<s> if you are hoping, there are some wireless signal in your area.. then think again.. you are in a military base... probably they banned all signal..  </s>
<s> just connect the wireless router/modem to your provider line.. configure it.. (give it a name/ssid, enable wep/wpa/wpa2 security, then your laptop will pick up the signal... enter the name and password required (you create this when you enable the security).. thats it...  </s>
