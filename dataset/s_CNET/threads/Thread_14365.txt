11782	7	245547	2475362	2474945	derby123	5/2/07 6:37 am	1.17808782e12	hey	mmmm i would go for the hp hp a6030n with amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core processor 4800+ graphics nvidia geforce 6150 se first th processor is the same speed it may differ a little bit but the intel graphics arent recommended however i experiences the 6150 le video card and it can run new games with considerble graphics but look if u are looking for gaming i dont recommend hp
11782	8	245547	2475364	2475283	ramarc	5/2/07 6:57 am	1.17808902e12	no, the x2 4800+ is faster than a e6300	the e6300 'wins' most sysmark timings compared to a 4600+, but in 80% of the other benchmarks, an x2 4600+ is equal to or faster an e6300. so an x2 4800+ is definitely faster than a e6300 (though the difference won't be noticeable in typical activities.) p.s.: tomshardware has never included the e6300 in its charts.

11782	11	245547	2475411	2475380	ramarc	5/2/07 7:38 am	1.17809148e12	a 65w x2 has lower power draw than a e6300	performance per watt is about the only area that amd has a consistent lead of intel.

11782	13	245547	2476303	2475238	everwanted2	5/3/07 1:00 am	1.178154e12	i would go with the amd	i was in the same quandary just last week for the same two desktops. i even bought the 6030 but returned as soon as i found an open box at sams club for an hpm7767c, e6600 processor, 2 gigs ram, 600 gb harddrive, nvidia 7500, and a 22 inch monitor for a spanking 849.99!!! the the e6300 beats the amd in many areas, and vice versa. but i still would have gone with the amd for its more stylish casing, graphics card, and faster baseline processor speed.
