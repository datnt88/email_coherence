can a new hard drive be cloned through a usb port if the old drive is still functioning? i have an external hard drive enclosure with a usb connector.
i used clonezilla. others use other things. what stopped you from getting this done? bob
i always thought you had to connect the drives internally to clone them. since i have an enclosure, i thought it would be so much easier to clone the new drive externally. i didn't know it could be done through the usb port. thanks for the info bob
after doing this too many times over the years i noticed that write speed is slower over than read speed. this has lead to me putting the new drive inside the machine and the old drive outside in the usb case. downside? i have to watch my answers and clicks to what drive is the source and which is the one to write to but it may save me an hour. bob
thanks for the info bob.
