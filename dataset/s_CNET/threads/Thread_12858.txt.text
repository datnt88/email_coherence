i have just got my hands on a secondhand dell model no dhm and the hard drive is scrubed. now i cant get it to load i dont get any thing at all and i dont have any discs with it could any one advise what to use.
not all dells came with windows so there is no automatic right to run that. maybe you just need to use it for the web, word processing and such? may i suggest you try pclinuxos and ubuntu which are popular and free, easy to install cds. bob
thanks bob the pc is licencde for 2000 pro but i cant get the basic startup prompts i wonder if i could dowload some form of a boot disc
if you can't boot that, there are problems with the machine or you forgot to set the cd as the boot device.  has... boot disks. i'm unsure what good they will do without an os cd. bob
i will try that site thanks for your help
