<s> ok, i know it sounds weird asking if something thats free is worth it, but heres the story.  </s>
<s> i was at my buddies house today and i noticed his partialy gutted computer lying around.  </s>
<s> i asked if he would be willing to part with it and he said i could have it for free if i wanted, since he had no use for it.  </s>
<s> thing is, its missing some key components.  </s>
<s> its missing a processor, but thats no problem, i have an athlon xp 3000 lying around.  </s>
<s> its missing a graphics card, but thats not a problem either, i have various agp graphics cards around my house.  </s>
<s> missing a hard drive, but i have a pata hard drive lying around as well... what i dont have lying around is ram. it takes pc3200, two slots.  </s>
<s> a trip to the futureshop website showed a 1gb stick for 30 bucks (kingston) so i would probably get 2 of those for 60. another thing i dont have is a monitor.  </s>
<s> a good lcd will set me back what, 150, 160 dollars?  </s>
<s> so i feel like im spending too much money and effort on a pc thats realy quite old and slow, but i always wanted to have a desktop in my room so :lol: .  </s>
<s> so do you guys think im wasting money, or is this a reasonable amount to spend to fix up a pc this slow?  </s>
<s> thanks for reading this far.  </s>

<s> sorry, i copied this from my post on another forum and for some reason it doubled the post.  </s>
<s> on freecycle i see free crt monitors weekly it seems.  </s>
<s> so the display could be a freebie too.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> well first off i've never heard of freecycle, lol.  </s>
<s> secondly a crt would be too big to put on my desk.  </s>
<s> the class of machine you are looking at was plagued with far too many issues. the athlon core would vaporize in a split second (watch ) and far too many had the bad caps issue.  </s>
<s> unless you can get it all for free it's not a good deal. it would be a shame to spend one dime and then discover why the machine was stripped and set aside.  </s>
<s> if you want something small and nice i'll share i picked up that 350 buck acer aspire one.  </s>
<s> it's been a hoot.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i've run an athlon core for like 4 years with no problems.  </s>
<s> it will only vaporise if im retarded and take off the heatsink when its on.  </s>
<s> having seen this machine class at the shop counters far too often my advice is to not spend a dime to get it working.  </s>
<s> if you get it all working for free then you can decide to upgrade the display, etc. remember you are asking for opinions and i'm sharing mine freely.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i think what i'll do is this: buy the ram, put the whole thing together and sell it.  </s>
<s> maybe on ebay or in a local paper.  </s>
<s> just sell it as tower only and all i'll have to buy is the ram.  </s>
<s> i could definitely sell the tower for more than the price i paid for the ram.  </s>
<s> its a good moneymaking scheme  </s>
