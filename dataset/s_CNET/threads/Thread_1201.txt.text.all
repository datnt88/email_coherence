<s> my screen has gone blurry, and i would really like to know what would be causing it.  </s>
<s> usually a blurry screen is the result of the monitor itslef.  </s>
<s> to verify this find another monitor and hook it up.  </s>
<s> if the other monitor does the same thing you might try updating your video drivers or getting a new video subsystem altogether, but i've never heard of a video card getting blurry, not to say it can't happen.  </s>
<s> it is a signal that you may have to replace your monitor, blurry screens signal defective flyback or other monitor parts.  </s>
<s> a monitor or crt (if yours is not an lcd type) may get busted after a long term use like light bulbs.  </s>
<s> try using your monitor to some other computers for you to check.  </s>
<s> if the same problem occurs, then spare some money to buy a new monitor.  </s>
<s> if the monitor runs okay with other computers check your video card if you are using one, an on-board video adapter is more difficult to deal with.  </s>
