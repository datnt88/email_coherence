my screen has gone blurry, and i would really like to know what would be causing it. 
usually a blurry screen is the result of the monitor itslef. 
to verify this find another monitor and hook it up. 
if the other monitor does the same thing you might try updating your video drivers or getting a new video subsystem altogether, but i've never heard of a video card getting blurry, not to say it can't happen. 
it is a signal that you may have to replace your monitor, blurry screens signal defective flyback or other monitor parts. 
a monitor or crt (if yours is not an lcd type) may get busted after a long term use like light bulbs. 
try using your monitor to some other computers for you to check. 
if the same problem occurs, then spare some money to buy a new monitor. 
if the monitor runs okay with other computers check your video card if you are using one, an on-board video adapter is more difficult to deal with.
