<s> there are four pcs in the house, all running xp and all with wireless internet access via a 802.11b/g router tied to the dsl modem. the router has several rj45 jacks for 'direct' network connection, and i'd like to plug a hard drive into one of these so that any of the pcs could access this &quot;network drive&quot; for backup or to access common files.  </s>
<s> i have looked for an appropriate hard drive, but still am not sure what features, etc. to specify.  </s>
<s> ideally it would 'spin down' if not accessed frequently.  </s>
<s> can someone provide a link to a suitable piece of hardware?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> but don't go too nuts on the size as copying files even at 100mb tends to test patience at times.  </s>
<s> that is, these devices called nas are on the shelves at the usual stores.  </s>
<s> try one.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks, bob; that abbreviation, &quot;nas&quot; was all i needed.  </s>
