purchased a dvi cable from newegg back in august 2006 for my nec multisync flat panel monitor, which worked fine. recently, i had to disassemble everything as we were having some work done around the house. now, i go to put everything back together and, low and behold, the dvi cable is missing. as best as i can recall, my monitor has a female port (in case that matters in terms of what kind of cable i purchase). i'd buy the same one, but it's been so long, newegg doesn't carry it anymore. does it matter which dvi cable i purchase? what should i be looking for? any suggestions on where/what to look at? i'm looking to resolve this asap as i have no computer access while this issue lingers. -jason

thanks, mr. proffitt. ordered the cable you listed from amazon. fingers crossed that all works out well.
just to clarify; all dvi out on pcs are male. the monitors, big screen tvs etc. are male as well.
