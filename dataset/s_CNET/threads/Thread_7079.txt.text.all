<s> hello, i just recently purchased a pair of bose 2.1 pc speakers.  </s>
<s> they are the bose companion 3 speakers which were rated very highly in the reviews which i read.  </s>
<s> while they do deliver excellent sound and decent power for their size, i feel as though they should be a little better based on their price and the reviews which i read.  </s>
<s> as of now they are connected to a p4 pc which is about 7 years old.  </s>
<s> the sound card is integrated into the motherboard, which is an asus sis 645 motherboard.  </s>
<s> my question is; if i upgrade my sound card by putting in a good pci one, will the sound improve on the speakers?  </s>
<s> will they deliver my power?  </s>
<s> in a sense, does the sound card act like an amp or receiver?  </s>
<s> any advice is much appreciated.  </s>
<s> yes it would help, go buy yourself a sound blaster, there are several variations and they aren't that expensive but that will help.  </s>
<s> good luck!!!  </s>
<s> ok thanks for the advice.  </s>
<s> i am going to look into upgrading my sound card.  </s>
<s> your soundcard is the hardware that's controlling the flow of audio. the better and faster it is the clearer and stabler the sound will be  </s>
<s> hi. while a dedicated sound card can improve drastically, the sound quality, it still only sends out a low level signal.  </s>
<s> which will have to go to either self powered speakers, or a separate amp, (or a/v reciever).  </s>
<s> i installed a creative sound card, which goes to my a/v rec. then to 6 speakers and a sub.  </s>
<s> i use the optical output which is virtually noise free.  </s>
<s> plus the musical detail is great.  </s>
<s> two of my spkrs.  </s>
<s> are bose.  </s>
<s> in short, the card only processes the signal.  </s>
<s> no amp, no reciever.  </s>
