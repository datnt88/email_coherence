i know nothing about building computers but i am gathering everything needed. i need help finding a good case for the motherboard, power supply, etc, can you guys give me some advice? also, please correct me if some of the things are not compatible with each other. motherboard:  processor:  ram:  hard drive:  power supply:  video card:  windows 7 home premium:  what else am i missing?!?!?!? any recommendations on a case that will fit everything in comfortably?
technically, you cannot buy that oem version of windows. while i doubt you'll get a knock on the door, it won't be legal according to the license policy. oem version are for resellers only. the price is quite cheap but you also have one other issue to deal with in that you will not be able to use that copy again if and when you build a new pc. you're spending plenty on your rig. i'd suggest a proper copy of windows would be a good idea.
that mobo seems to use quad channel. might be best to look for 4x4gb.
