<s> hi! i am planning on opening an internet cafe and i have planned to do the networking as shown in the image.  </s>
<s> please be kind enough to help me on what sort of server i have to build (including hardware specs.) and how to do the networking.  </s>
<s> thank s in advance.  </s>
<s> please find my sketch in the following link.  </s>
<s> and haven't we learned that it costs more than putting a cheap pc out there?  </s>
<s> or are you new to this? bob  </s>
<s> by the way, i wanna provide an excellent and hi-tech service to my customers.  </s>
<s> so, i selected this way rather than putting cheap stuffs.  </s>
<s> talk about the project, not about the cost.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> i see you are new so i need to give you time to discover that design had its day.  </s>
<s> it's no longer done for many reasons including the fact the cost is more than a pc at each station.  </s>
<s> write back when you are ready.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i agree with you that building a server is more expensive than setting up individual pcs.  </s>
<s> but, i wanna do it in this way.  </s>
<s> so, please help me.  </s>
<s> i can only guess you've not learned that there is no such server made today.  </s>
<s> that is, once in awhile you get the new person that thinks you can hang display, keyboard and mouse on some server and make it all work.  </s>
<s> they usually get upset there is nothing less than 2 times the cost of a pc. so here's the company and the products.  </s>
<s> so there you go.  </s>
<s> citrix on the server and hdx thin clients.  </s>
<s> done.  </s>
<s> i wonder still if you were so new you expected no client hardware.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> or why any pc at all?  </s>
<s> why not some internet cafe hot spot and folk bring their own pc, pad or such?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> omg! i didn't expect such a setup.  </s>
<s> it is easy and economical for me to setup individual pcs rather than setting up thin clients and stuffs.  </s>
<s> i thought i could build a big size cpu with some extra vga outputs and usb ports for my project.  </s>
<s> so, i am going to set up some vertical desktop cpus, so that i can make a compact setup.  </s>
<s> anyhow, thank you for your kind information.  </s>
<s> folk made such things.  </s>
<s> they were awfully expensive as each card was essentially a pc on a card.  </s>
<s> since it was not made in the volumes of your common pc or laptop the prices were always more than your pc. but folk always tried such things.  </s>
<s> today i rarely seen a citrix or windows terminal system because the pc is too cheap.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yeah bob that is what a couple of local outfits do here, it is really all he needs to do.  </s>
<s> you sell the coffee and treats.  </s>
<s> internet access is not a product today but a service at your store.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i am not going to start the business in usa or any eu countries.  </s>
<s> it's in sri lanka.  </s>
<s> so, don't compare your business strategies with us.  </s>
<s> we can't do business here as you do there.  </s>
<s> i am not going to start only a browsing center.  </s>
<s> also, we do computer hardware and software troubleshooting, mobile phone repairing and upgrading, photoshop and other typesetting deals and so on.  </s>
<s> i have no idea to sell coffee and treats as you suggest.  </s>
<s> wow, that's ambitious.  </s>
<s> in the usa it's pretty much just reset the phone and if it has a bad screen or jack you swap out a new phone.  </s>
<s> the days of repairing a phone are long gone.  </s>
<s> i'm guessing this is not in the usa.  </s>
<s> no one i know would attempt what you wrote here.  </s>
<s> for many reasons.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> my answers are mostly about areas from china, taiwan and us/canada.  </s>
