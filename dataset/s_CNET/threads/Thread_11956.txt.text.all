<s> my 120 gb wd was working normally, i format it from a while and accidentally deleted all manufacture drivers/folders that comes originally with it.  </s>
<s> after that i continued to work properly for a couple of weeks and now suddenly i can see it anymore!  </s>
<s> i connect it to my laptop or desktop - i tried different usbs and machine and different operating systems (xp & vista) but no result.  </s>
<s> it shows in the tray bar that i have an external connected, it shows in the device manager inside the &quot;disk drives&quot; a &quot;wd&quot; icon but with no specifications so i can't see it in my computer neither in computer management---&gt;disk management !! so please tell me what i can do?what is the solution?now  </s>
<s> i don't mind to loose my data on it but i want it to work again.  </s>
<s> i hope to receive a helpful answer from you and thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> if u need to know anything else i am ready.  </s>
<s> seems broken.  </s>
<s> essentially, an external drive has 2 parts: 1. the case 2. the drive i'd start with buying a new case and mount the existing drive in it.  </s>
<s> then see if it works.  </s>
<s> could very well be.  </s>
<s> if it doesn't, buy a new drive also.  </s>
<s> that probably leaves you with one broken disc and one spare case for future use.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> thx for the quick reply, maybe i have to add that it's a passport size external not the normal size one that can be opened easily and checked on another case or even used as internal to check.  </s>
<s> by the way i know about the externals but thx anyway for the explanation.  </s>
<s> i hope that there is some solutions out there.  </s>
<s> the options are: - have it repaired by a repair shop - buy a new one without caring about repair kees  </s>
<s> i just picked up a wd 500 gig for 89.00 at best buy if its any help  </s>
