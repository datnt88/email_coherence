<s> i was wondering if anyone might be able to point me to a place where i could find a slimline form factor dvd burner (preferably dual layer) that could be made region free.  </s>
<s> i own dvd's from more than one region and i'd like to build a home theatre pc. i am looking to put it into this case: thanks, george  </s>
<s> you didn't specify a country but in the us such things can't be legally sold.  </s>
<s> but there is hope and that is to use cnet's article on how to remove the region restriction.  </s>
<s> here's the article -&gt; the end result will be region free.  </s>
<s> cheers, bob  </s>
<s> i just checked your link, maybe i'm missing it, but i see that the article talks about how cnet tests dvd burners, i didn't happen to see anything about removing the region protection from dvd's.  </s>
<s> i am in europe and i'd like to have the ability to watch american dvd's i bought when i was over there, but i'd also like to be able to watch any dvd i might buy here in europe, so that's basically where i'm heading with this.  </s>
<s> thanks, george  </s>
<s> it varies with the country.  </s>
<s> i know in aus such drives are available.  </s>
<s> sorry you missed the result of the article.  </s>
<s> it's a region free copy.  </s>
<s> what more do i need to add here?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'm not sure i understand what you meant about missing the result of the article.  </s>
<s> i pulled up the link and didn't see anything about how to make dvd burners region free.  </s>
<s> anyway, i am looking to purchase the dvd burner on the internet, so i was wondering if anyone knew of some place on line that sells region free dvd's that would fit in that case i posted earlier, or at least a dvd burner that can be made to be region free either via a firmware upgrade or some code that can be entered.  </s>

<s> here such things are not allowed for import so we don't see them often.  </s>
<s> the website that writes about firmware upgrades is frankly something that is a good source of drive sales for my friends.  </s>
<s> given the cnet article and what happens when we use that, why would i need a region free drive?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> unless you intend to leave your dvds made for american consumption at home in the usa, the best solution is to just buy a region-free- or all-region dvd player.  </s>
<s> i brought a boatload of dvds back from a two-year trip to china home with me.  </s>
<s> i found a panasonic player online that handles the dvds better than my chinese player did.  </s>
<s> i hope that this helps.  </s>
<s> i've seen the region free players as stand alone dvd players.  </s>
<s> what i wanted to find was a slimline form factor region free dvd drive to stick it a home theater pc case (i posted a link to it earlier in the thread).  </s>
<s> i guess my other choice would be to buy a case that houses two dvd drives and have one for the states and one for europe.  </s>
