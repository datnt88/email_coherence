so turns out my attempt to upgrade my video card resulted in my frying the motherboard. i see i can get a refurb from dell. any thoughts?
dell direct replacement should get you going with the least amount of hassle. though, excluding any 2ndary issues or continuing problems, it will be the least intrusive and you can continue on as if nothing happened. any other action you take will require extra effort on your part if not a dell mtrbd. and you can ask questions on this topic later. for now i see no reason not to continue using dell, if that suits you. tada -----willy
from the big box mfgs are usually not inexpensive. so as you get cost info on replacing the failed parts ... keep in mind the new pc too. vapcmd
