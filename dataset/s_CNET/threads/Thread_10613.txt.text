i have a 64mb sdram pc100 100mghz on my win98 pc and i tried to replace it with 256mb sdram pc133 168pin. the problem is when i boot up my pc the screen starts to count up to 256mb then the screen becomes filled with coloured squares that are continuously flashing. the brand of memory i purchased was azenram. does anyone know the possible problem and how to solve it?
the memory is obviously not compatible with your system. you should check with a company like crucial ( and put in the specifications of your system so you can get memory that is recommended. not all systems that use 100mhz ram work with 133mhz, most will, but not all. do try removing and reseating the memory as a final test before returning it.
your description is typical of some machines i've seen with onboard video and a few others. it's a sign the memory stick isn't compatible. just because it plugs in, doesn't mean it will work. bob
thanks guys, now that i realize the memory i bought is incompatible. does anyone have any advice on how to figure out what type of memory i should buy? doityourself
if its a brand name, look up crucial.com your post neglected to share make/model/etc so no one can give a direct answer. bob
the machine is: compaq presario 7469 win98 2nd edition os 64mb sdram pc100 100mghz bus clock: 100mghz processor: 500mghz amd
that machine may need specific memory modules. look to vendors that have selectors that note your machine. bob
