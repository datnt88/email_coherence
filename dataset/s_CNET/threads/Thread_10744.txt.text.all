<s> using a windowxp pro os... with plenty of ram stick with onboard audio and a soundblaster pci card... now is it possible to use two soundcards at once.. now the reason im asking is because i have two separate inputs specifically for mic..i'd like to record simultaneously... guitar and voice.... now ive tried the splitter and it really degrades the signal... as we know with a splitter we get half the channel... by the way i am using a soundblaster live 5.1 ... with line in mic in headphone and line out ... any ideas ?  </s>
<s> thankyou kindly  </s>
<s> no! you will have decide on one sound card.  </s>
<s> you could get an externial audio mixer to mix the audio then send it to the line input.  </s>
<s> or get a pro type sound card like the m-audio delta44 which has 4 line inputs.  </s>
