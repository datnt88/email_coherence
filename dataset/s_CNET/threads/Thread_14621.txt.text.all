<s> i am in the market to replace my laptop, which i have not liked from the get go.  </s>
<s> i have had it for two years.  </s>
<s> the reason i went to a laptop was space, but i use it like a desktop.  </s>
<s> i don't transport it places.  </s>
<s> i use it in my kitchen at my desk.  </s>
<s> i primarily use it for digital pictures, outlook managing of schedules, email and internet searching.  </s>
<s> i currently own a winbook basic laptop.  </s>
<s> it shuts down frequently with overheating and has done this since about a year after i purchased.  </s>
<s> my question: i looked at the imac ma1999ll; intel core duo processor(1.83ghz)512mb  </s>
<s> ddr2-667 ram;160gb 7,200rpm serial ata hard drive; 8x superdrive 2.4x double layer dvd rw drive; ati radeon x1600 graphics chipset; 10/100/1000 gigabit network adapter;wireless extreme adapter; 17&quot; screen;mac os x 10.4 &quot;tiger&quot; and the hp/pavilion slimline s7530n; intel pentium m processor 735a (1.7ghz); 1gb ddr2-400 ram; 250gb 7,200rpm serial ata hard drive; lightscribe double layer 16 dvd rw drive; intel graphics media accelerator 900 video chipset; 10/100 network adapter; built-in 802.11b/g 54mbps wireless network adapter; 56k modem, microsoft windows xp media center edition 2005.  </s>
<s> my question: i have never had a mac, but it appealed to me with the all in one concept for a desktop (space is an issue).  </s>
<s> however, i have always used a computer with some type of windows os on it.  </s>
<s> how easy is it to convert over to mac (i used windows xp office student edition) and what are the negatives and positives.  </s>
<s> i have been told that the mac os does not have as many issues with sypware and viruses that the windows xp os system does.  </s>
<s> i believe some of that since we have had those issues with both of the computers we have.  </s>
<s> your thoughts and recommendations.  </s>
<s> another thought is to go to another laptop, but again i do use this computer like a desktop; it is on all the time.  </s>
<s> i wonder how it's used since laptops are often misused today such as putting it on some soft surface (blocks airflow) or it's the owner that selected a desktop cpu in a notebook form. the lesson about pentium 4 notebooks seems to be neverending.  </s>
<s> given the notebook issue, the same problems may follow to the next machine unless we discover what went wrong.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you're not alone in your thinking, recent changes by apple to intel processors has opened the thinking of many.  </s>
<s> personally, i like the mac as well; it's sexy, all in one, etc. but i have to remind myself the gains you get from a mac are from the software, not the hardware.  </s>
<s> so why buy equipment built to run it's own software and install windows taking you right back to where you came from?  </s>
<s> with that being said, imagine yourself on the phone with tech support about a software conflict and you expain your running win xp on a mac and getting errors using their product?  </s>
<s> i suspect you'll get a long pause and the traditional ''we cannot support that configuration!'' so, i ask you ''is the climb worth the view?  </s>
<s> for my money stay with the windows product if that is the enviroment you're be working and make sure the new hardware will support vista when it arrives!  </s>
<s> i own an hp slimline, and couldn't be happoer with it.  </s>
<s> it's small, powerful, and fits well on my desk, which is pretty small.  </s>
<s> i haven't had a single problem, or lack of power with the system in the time i've owned it.  </s>
<s> one of the best computers out there, in my view.  </s>
<s> as for the mac, bleh.  </s>
<s> macs, in my view, aren't very user friendly, which i'm reminded of from my many times spent fighting with the ones at my school. the hp slimline is the better choice.  </s>
<s> if you go with it, you wont be sorry.  </s>
<s> i would buy a mac.  </s>
<s> don't mess around with the hp labtop.  </s>
<s> i think the new mac book will work just fine. the mac book can also run windows, but i would buy the new os (the leopard ox operating system.  </s>
<s> look, we all know mac is better.  </s>
<s> it is a lot better than any pc on the market.  </s>
<s> first of all, a pc desktop comes with a 4-ton box and a crappy os. mac is faster, sleeker and more user friendly than a pc. hp is a good laptop, but even now, the only thing making it a good laptop is the fact that it is using mac's technology.  </s>
<s> as soon as mac made a new design in keyboards (bigger keys, backlights and spacing) hp did(about a month later.) mac is better in just about every way.  </s>
<s> (and don't get me started on how mac doesn't crash or get viruses and windows do.)  </s>
