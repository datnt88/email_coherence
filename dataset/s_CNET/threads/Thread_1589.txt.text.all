<s> for example, a flat panel display, monitor and a projector are all examples of a vdu.  </s>
<s> vdu is most commonly used to describe a standard crt monitor.  </s>
<s> vertical retrace - also known as a vertical blanking interval or the vertical sync signal, vertical retrace describes the action performed within the computer that turns the monitor beam off when moving it from the lower-right corner of a monitor to the upper-left of the monitor.  </s>
<s> this action takes place each time the beam has completed tracing the entire screen to create an image.  </s>
<s> vesa - short for video electronics standard association, vesa is a group of monitor and video card manufactures that set various display standards.  </s>
<s> vga - short for video graphics array, vga is a popular display standard developed by ibm.  </s>
<s> vga provides 640 x 480 resolution color display screens with a refresh rate of 60hz and 16 colors displayed at a time.  </s>
<s> if the resolution is lowered to 320 x 200, 256 colors can be displayed.  </s>
<s> vga capability is built into plug -in video cards, vga chips, and monitors that can work with the vga cards.  </s>
<s> today vga has been supplanted by svga.  </s>
<s> video - electronic signal of moving graphics, pictures and/or text used to combine a fluent source of images used for entertainment, education or other uses.  </s>
<s> video accelerator - video card with integrated processor and memory to increase the overall capabilities of video graphics.  </s>
<s> today most video accelerators are used for computer gaming.  </s>
<s> video adapter - also known as a graphics card, video card, video board, or a video controller.  </s>
<s> a video adapter is an internal circuit board that allows a display device such as a monitor to display images from the computer.  </s>
<s> video buffer - a storage location in a system or video cards memory that holds information before it is sent to the display device.  </s>
<s> video digitizer - software that takes an analog video still frame and coverts it to a digital still image.  </s>
<s> this is generally accomplished with the aid of computer hardware.  </s>
<s> video display page - a video screen image stored in the video buffer.  </s>
<s> video conferencing - computer software, hardware, or other device capable of transmitting a video signal to another computer software program or hardware device allowing other individuals to see a picture of the participants in a conference.  </s>
<s> video memory - memory on the video card, in some cases located on the motherboard, which is accessible by the video and computer processor.  </s>
<s> with more video memory, the video card and computer is capable of handling more complex graphics at a faster rate.  </s>
<s> video card memory may be between 8 and 512mb of memory.  </s>
<s> videotex - technology developed in the u.s. that allowed users to read text news on a television by using a receiver and a dedicated line.  </s>
<s> because of the interface, cost, and other factors the videotex system never became popular and is no longer in service or used.  </s>
<s> vertical sync line - also known as vertical retrace or vertical blanking, vertical sync line describes the action performed within the computer that turns the monitor beam off when moving it from the lower-right corner of a monitor to the upper-left of the monitor.  </s>
<s> this action takes place each time the beam has completed tracing the entire screen to create an image.  </s>
<s> vlf - short for very low frequency, vlf describes the electrical radiation emitted by computer monitors, televisions, and other cathode ray tubes (crts).  </s>
<s> w windows-based acceleration - super video graphics array adapter specially created to run microsoft windows programs faster.  </s>
<s> this should not be confused with standard svga cards.  </s>
<s> wireframe - the simplest type of data representation for 3-d models.  </s>
<s> wireframe modeling is a natural outgrowth of 2-d cad in that such models only contain information on edges and vertices.  </s>
<s> with a wireframe modeler, there is no implicit information on the boundary between inside and outside the model volume.  </s>
<s> wireframe can also refer to a rendering technique in which only the edges and vertices are represented in the image.  </s>
