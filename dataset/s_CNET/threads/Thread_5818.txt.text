i have recently bought a 64 gb memory stick and i am having problems opening some files copied on it. some windows media files won't open and i get the following message: windows media player cannot play the file. the player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file. i also have similar problems with some power point and word documents. the usb memory stick is unbranded and is fomated as fat32. my operating system is windows vista ultimate
codecs are hard on users. use vlc player next time to avoid learning about them. also, fat32 is cruising for a bruising. why use old unreliable?
sounds as if it might be a codec issue, before you try to transfer anything else to your f/d download and run the avi codec pack and see if that doesn't do the trick. good luck.
thanks for your advice. maybe i did not clarify that the same file plays on another memory stick and on the computer. only when copied on this new memory stick it does not paly.
thanks for your response. i have tried the vlc player as recommended, but still did not work. i do not think it is a problem of the codecs as the same file plays on another memory stick on the same computer.
