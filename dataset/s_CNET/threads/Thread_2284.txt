(video is a side job for me) i'm looking a 2.0 ghz or faster processor, at least 1 gig of ram, and a decent video card. hard drive size doesn't matter- i'm going to buy an external. so what mac would be best for me? i'm on a very tight budget. i thought about buying a mini, adding a dvd burner, and adding ram, but the processor speed wouldn't be that great. so should i get a macbook? or am i better off with an imac? portability is not an issue- i'm just looking for the best value for my money.

6912	6	251939	2513607	2513546	boya84	6/13/07 9:06 pm	1.18176876e12	but mrmacfixit is right...	the graphics card is not the long pole when editing video. the cpu is - either when importing or rendering a dvd. yes, video functionality is needed - and to answer the original post question directly, the cheapest mac to edit video on is the macmini, and when importing standard definition, everything would be fine - and the video card is hardly used... even the video in the imovie window would hardly get it breathing hard (even if it is highdef) but rendering the edited video out to a dvd or whatever flavor quicktime movie or avi or mpeg4 or other format goes frame-by-frame and *that* needs cpu cycles (and ram) big time. you are correct, upgrading the video card in an imac is not a field mod most folks want to do (or can do and continue to have the mac under warranty). you are correct that the larger imac has a better video card. you are also correct that the macpro tower has available slots for video cards (among other things), but the macpro tower is not the &quot;cheapest mac that will edit video&quot;.

(as an aside, you want the biggest screen you can afford, like the 24&quot; imac for example, to edit and hold all your palettes and windows. small screens make editing miserable. even a second monitor such as a 22&quot; dell would be a smart purchase.) so you may need a mid-to-high-end imac or macbook pro to do real-time editing without choppy or delayed playback. and a mini or macbook probably won't be fast enough unless you like to sit on your hands while your minutes of footage render. i bought a mid-level mac pro for that very reason...and even upgraded to the top-end $300 ati x1900 video card to guarantee good performance. it wasn't cheap, but it will run anything you throw at it and be useful for years. consider this purchase an investment that will pay itself off after three or four decent editing gigs.
