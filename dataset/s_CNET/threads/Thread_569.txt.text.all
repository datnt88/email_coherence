<s> does anyone know of a good quality wireless backlit keyboard?  </s>
<s> where not just media or extra keys are lit, but the qwerty keys are illuminated as well?  </s>
<s> i'm looking for something for an htpc setup.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> can you imagine the power requirements for such?  </s>
<s> how big a battery would it need?  </s>
<s> this board'll be out in september.  </s>
<s> the cnet review i link to below has done a good job of outlining the pros and cons, and the ms hardware link below has a nice interactive multimedia demo of the board's features.  </s>
<s> seems like it'll be perfect for htpc use, though the price certainly has some kick to it (i wish they'd offer it without the mouse bundled in for $50-$75 less).  </s>
