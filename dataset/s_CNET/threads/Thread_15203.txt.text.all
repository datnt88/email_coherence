<s> my parents had an old dell computer that was super slow, so they got a new hp. they wanted to keep the old hd because of the pictures &amp; documents.  </s>
<s> so my question is how can i go about hooking up thier old hd for them to get what they need off it and transfer the documents and pictures.  </s>
<s> hard drive  </s>
<s> they cost around $25 and you can buy them in most stores that sell computers.  </s>
<s> be sure to get the right size (2.5&quot; or 3.5&quot; and type (ide or sata).  </s>
<s> put the drive in the enclosure and plug it into a usb slot.  </s>
<s> windows will recognize it and assign it a drive letter where you can access it with computer (aka windows explorer).  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> new pc temporarily or permanently .... you could always use it for backup in the new system.  </s>
<s> all you should need is another sata cable.  </s>
