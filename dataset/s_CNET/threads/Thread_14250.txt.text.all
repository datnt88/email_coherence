<s> hi all, ive just joined this site here to see if i can get sum help.  </s>
<s> i think i have fried my motherboard, there is no power getting to my pc. i was tying to install my geforce graphics into my imedia x2416 and i got fustrated and pulled a wire out from something which i assumed might be the integrated graphics card (it was a silver box which is not the hard dive, maybe it was the memory im not sure).  </s>
<s> i tried to turn off the computer but the fans and stuff started going faster and then the computer went off.  </s>
<s> now it wont turn on.  </s>
<s> im asssuming too much power has went to the other components and has short circuited the motherboard.  </s>
<s> would i be right in assuming this? will i have to buy a new motherboard or can i get it fixed?? i think imedias have a denver 11 motherboard.  </s>
<s> please help and advise, thanks.  </s>
<s> p.s im computer illiterate as you can tell so now jargon plz.  </s>
<s> find the nearest computer repair shop and let them have a look.  </s>
<s> much better than trying to diagnose this from a distance.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> is that goina be dear u think?  </s>
<s> guy quoted me 60 just to have a look at it and see whats wong.  </s>
<s> can i not test it myself to see whats wrong, i heard one way is to replace each component with a working one and see what component is broke.  </s>
<s> but i dont have spare components so is there another way?  </s>
<s> if it is that expensive, why not research on a new rig instead?  </s>
<s> wear and tear also plays a part and if the purchase is only just recently, there should always be a warranty to fall back on.  </s>
<s> i got this problem sorted so just want to let you know what happened in case it happeneds to any of you and your pc goes dead.  </s>
<s> while i was investigating and talking to some tech guys they told me i should do 3 things before i take it into the store (because thats what they do first when they get it) 1. change the fuse in the plug 2. plug it into a different socket 3. take the cables out and hold in the power button for 10-15secs (this flushes out any static) turns out i hadnt fried my motherboard at all as i suspected but after doing step one i realised i add just blown the fuse.  </s>
<s> problem solved.  </s>
<s> maybe you wanna pass this advice onto any noobies with the same problem.  </s>
