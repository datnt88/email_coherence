fellow members, i recently installed a new hard drive. in my efforts to get the thing working i must have changed some setting in bios, which i had to fool with, because now the system is doing a tedious ram check routine on the black screen with each boot. it takes a couple of precious minutes to count up to 512. fyi it is ami bios. i cannot discover any changes to make in bios setup to disable it. 2. the setup shows the smart drive feature is disabled. i would like it running.
also post the mobo type to give a clue lots of ami bios'. check the mobo manual which usually describes which bios features are in your bios and what they do. make sure that in adding the drive you did not unseat the memory or that you have not created a heat situation. it also sounds as if you may have added a bios add-on with the drive. knowing your o/s will also give a better clue.
you need to enable quick post (power on self test). i think it's in advanced bios setup. may depend on your bios version. os doesn't matter.
save and exit.
thanks for the info. it has stopped doing that foolishness. anyway it was saying &quot;testing nv ram&quot; - which means non-volatile ram -- which makes no sense.
