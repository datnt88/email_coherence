ok i got my motorola s805 headphones today and i figuired out to connect it to my ipod touch but what about my computer i have a hp pavilion tx2500z and i bought a bluetooth usb dongle. 
i don't know why it won't work. 
please help! 
but when i researched how to get audio from a pc to blue tooth headsets i found the skype articles to help the most. 
do you have the bluetooth stack in your system? 
likely the issue, would show in device manager. 
if you don't i think there is a download from broadcomfor that purpose. 
thanks guys but i figuired it out. 
working with bluesoleil version 2 was slightly vague on somethings and i finally figuired it out.
