4607	6	302293	2818510	2818515	r. proffitt	7/24/08 12:18 pm	1.21690188e12	what?	that sounds very expensive. why would you not just buy that latest retail version? keep in mind that nero doesn't work with all drives or media types. i dropped a hint earlier about the log containing more clues but let me try blunt! 1. what make of the media that fails? 2. what firmware version for each drive make and model too please?
4607	7	302293	2818519	2818510	mohamed_e56	7/24/08 12:28 pm	1.21690248e12	not like you think	nero 7 came with the dvd and a ferind had nero 8 so i setup it and i had nero 6 with the old writer and both of the writers was working on nero very good and the cd rw i had updated it's fireware any way i even had 2 windows they both don't work in both windows windows vista ultimate and xp and i had tried other windows xp an windows vista even windows xp pro and home edtiom and vista ultimate and vista home and they didn't work pease help i can return back the dvd but the old one i need to fix it

4607	10	302293	2818553	2818521	r. proffitt	7/24/08 1:29 pm	1.21690614e12	not much.	this is the bane of the oem versions. they seem to do odd things when firmware or drive change. glad we've found it. since you don't have the full retail copy look to freeware dvd and other creation/burning programs.
