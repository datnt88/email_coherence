<s> i have an older compaq and want to upgrade the video card .  </s>
<s> will the newer 4x or better cards be backwards compatible on the 2x board or will i be wasting power and not see much improvement?  </s>

<s> i do such all the time. the cards are &quot;keyed&quot; to keep you from plugging in an incompatible card.  </s>
<s> since no one knows what the old and new cards are, the result will be uncertain.  </s>

<s> at even 50 bucks the fx5200's are aplenty.  </s>
<s> is a fx5500 for 59 bucks and my kid could play far cry at some settings with ease on his p4. the fx5200 is ten bucks less all over, but i'd go one step up.  </s>
