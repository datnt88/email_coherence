<s> i currently have a quad amd phenom 9600, 500 gig hard drive, 4 gigs ram, nvidia geforce 8800gt windows vista 32 bit.  </s>
<s> super multi dvd+rw dl w/lableflash.  </s>
<s> hands down all time best place to buy hardware!  </s>
<s> super cheap + huge selection + very well organized site downside is they don't offer any technical support so you would have to contact the manufacturer for that support.  </s>
<s> lots of people also like tigerdirect.com.  </s>
<s> they say it is super cheap, but i don't like it that much because it is very poorly organized.  </s>
<s> fry's is supposed to be really cheap as well although i've never been in one because it is so far away.  </s>
<s> newegg is pretty big on these forums (to the point i've wondered which posters work for them) -- i've used them and have liked them, didn't particularly like tigerdirect, did like pacificgeek.com and geeks.com.  </s>
<s> i've also found a lot of things on ebay, particularly looking for older/rarer items.  </s>
<s> the downside with any of those on-line companies is timing, expense of shipping, and the vagaries of buying things you can't actually see.  </s>
<s> for example, i had to return a motherboard i bought on-line.  </s>
<s> that required a phone call, wait for rma email, then i had to pack it up and ship at my expense, and a unnecessarily long wait for the credit to be run thru to my card.  </s>
<s> in contrast i've also had a cpu that was dead on arrival.  </s>
<s> but since i got it at a local store, i took it back, they did some testing right there to confirm it was defective, and i walked out with an immediate replacement.  </s>
<s> to be honest, i paid $30 more for that cpu than i would have at the cheapest online or ebay.  </s>
<s> but i was able to finish the build the same weekend i started it.  </s>
<s> on-line shopping, if anything is backordered, returned, or anything like that, you're waiting for at least another weekend to actually get your work done.  </s>
<s> as far as having great stuff, it's all the same stuff.  </s>
<s> a phenom is a phenom, etc. regardless which store sold it.  </s>
<s> i'll be honest, there's a good handful of newegg receipts in my email, and i've liked them.  </s>
<s> but you have to understand stores like them have zero service or support.  </s>
<s> until you need it, &quot;service&quot; is rather nebulous.  </s>
<s> but it has a real value, as does your time.  </s>
<s> newegg's site is great with it's advanced search.  </s>
<s> once i figure out what i want, i price check with zipzoomfly, and mwave.  </s>
<s> buy.com has more mainstream stuff and free shipping so it's sometimes the best price for monitors, hard drives, and even some specific video cards and power supplies, etc.  </s>
<s> provantage has a lot of stuff that newegg doesn't zipzoom, as mentioned here, is very limited but often has the best price.  </s>
<s> i've dealt with them.  </s>
<s> what i do like about newegg is their pictures of the products.  </s>
<s> they are by far the best at giving you an idea of what you're getting...inside and outside of the box.  </s>
<s> provantage does have a lot of the better brands....particularly with networking goods.  </s>
<s> i live in they state they are addressed in so they do charge me tax.  </s>
<s> their shipping is cheaper than newegg and often the pricing too so the total costs are close.  </s>
<s> i've had excellent service from both newegg and provantage.  </s>
