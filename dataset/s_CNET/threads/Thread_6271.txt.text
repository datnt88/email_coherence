according to this article (  ), the 1080p mb168b+ monitor is supposed to be released during august, but i can't find much information about it online. has anyone heard anything?
sales seem to be nowhere and blogs and makers try and try again. seems like a niche product since no one reports they can play video on such things. maybe with usb 3.0 that will finally let you watch a movie but if you have seem the average notebook tank on performance my bet is that folk will again go back to hdmi. besides, without hdcp, your average bluray title will not play on this. bob
i'm really interested in something like this for work. i would use it mostly for excel, word, pdf viewing/editing, etc. i would just prefer a monitor with a resolution higher than 1366 x 768 like the 16&quot; aoc monitor out there.
the other downside is the cost. being a niche product you pay a premium. if you just want a second display, a common monitor is the cheap fix. almost all laptops will do a dual display. the wallet is usually the decider here. for me, i'd give usb 3.0 displays a wide berth since drivers are still iffy. you don't want to know the stories. bob
sorry, i wasn't very clear. i travel frequently for work, and i do the bulk of my work at client locations and in hotel rooms. so i need a monitor that's travel friendly. i'm having trouble finding non-usb monitors that are very travel friendly and have a higher resolution.
do you have any suggestions for a good travel monitor that is approx 16 inches and isn't just a usb-connected monitor?
for example. but given your story, why not go for it and be clear about your return options? i didn't want to name names but the usual 4 letter makers has had some issues with usb 3.0 bob
