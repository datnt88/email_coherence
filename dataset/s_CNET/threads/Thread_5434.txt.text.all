<s> i have a dell 8300 2 years old.  </s>
<s> i can only boot into safe mode because i'm having xp home issues.  </s>
<s> i need to move important files (20gb worth - movies and mp3s) to something and i'm purchasing an external hard drive soon.  </s>
<s> question is, can i move those files to the external hd when i can only boot to safe mode?  </s>
<s> if so, how do i do that?  </s>
<s> won't let you access your usb ports.  </s>
<s> unless you get xp working the best thing to do is put that hd in another system as a slave and do your file transfers from there.  </s>
<s> and life goes on... jack  </s>
<s> i've been using a knoppix (google.com)  </s>
<s> boot cd and that let's me copy files out to fat32 formatted usb hard disks.  </s>
