i'm getting ready to build a system for myself. here's the specs: asus am2 mobo nforce 570sli chipset evga geforce 7900gt (non-oc'd) kingwin 600w psu amd athlon 64 x2 4200+ (might overclock eventually) wd caviar 250gb hard drive here's my debate: i'm going to buy ddr2 667 or better ram. right now, i'm looking at corsair ram, 2gb, latency 4, 4-4-4-12 timings. however, for a little bit more, i could get mushkin extreme, 2gb, latency 3, 3-3-3-10 ram. i know quite a bit about computers, but ram would have to be my most lacking area. i know the mushkin ram has better timings and latency, but i've also heard a few bad things about mushkin, albeit not much. i need opinions: who's better? muskin or corsair? i know a few of my fellow tech heads will help me out on this one. thanks!
these are both ddr2 667 ram sets.
covers a lot of ground and benchmarks so you can test which one wins. however i've found such testing to turn up less than 1% speed payback so i've ceased overtesting this area in favor of price per gb and stability. bob
here's a review of the mushkin extreme:
personally i'd go with corsair. i've never had any problems with any corsair ram.
i didn't even think about looking for ram reviews online. appreciate the help.
