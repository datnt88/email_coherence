my system reported a degraded raid array and one hard drive became inaccessible. the motherboard and hard drive were replaced, but the same problem recurred in 4 weeks. hard drive was then replaced again, but the problem repeated immediately. hp proposes trying the hard drive replacement again. machine is running windows 7 64 bit, and i have made no hardware modifications. it was purchased in january, 2011. has anyone experienced this problem? can anything else be done to solve this problem?
however i think you are looking for failure proof machines. we don't have such today. bob
4 hard drive replacements within 3 months? that's hardly looking for failure proof.
you should ask for a lot better. reading your post i only saw 2 failures. at the office it's 4 years since the last drive failure. however that's at the office, on ups and in locked room so users can't touch it. bob
