i acquired an older dell optiplex gx520 desktop version computer and decided to ramp it up a bit. i put in a samsung ssd and started to upgrade the ram. i put 4gb (2gbx2) but the computer started to freeze on boot-up. i have windows 7 ultimate 64bit. if i take out one ram and put in a different one 1gb total of 3gb, it starts up no problem. i have just dealt with the 3gb. now i wanted to upgrade the video card since the on-board graphics were crappy. i put in an hix 5450 since it is the best pci only card out there (this motherboard doesn't have a pci express). now i am encountering the same problem with this as the ram upgrade where it freezes on the windows start-up screen. any help would be great.

i find it reasonable before attempting anything with a dell as in upgrades to be sure of the bios level. more often that not, there can be quite a difference. so, if you check and find a06 present and a11 available, do upgrade the bios and correctly follow instructions. next, exactly what are your dell specs for your model# plus its sn# or use the service tag# to truly id the product. in other words don't settle for the dell badge, know exactly what you have. then review the specs of your model# found. the info can vary if an user simply accepts model# across the board does this and that and the model# can vary as model# -a is different from model# -d even though both are dell model123. there can be a major difference, so be 100% sure.   i would for testing, disable or remove the virtual clonedrive. upgrade the bios, and verify your gx520 actually can use 2gb ram per slot. also ram is best as in matched pairs. yes, win7x64 can use above 4gb and/or can the intel p4(single core) really keep-up, if i suspect all of what your doing is pushing the cpu to its limits. it maybe a &quot;bottleneck&quot; sort of problem. tada -----willy
i figured out the issue with the ram and the new video card. i needed to update my bios to work with them. once i upgraded to a11 it worked perfect!! i had a little interesting time flashing the bios since i had window 7 x64. but i had an extra hdd that had 32 bit windows xp, plugged it in, ran the flash and perfecto, it worked. today is going to be a good day, i can feel it.
