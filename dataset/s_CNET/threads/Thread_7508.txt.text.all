<s> hi, thanks for your response.  </s>
<s> finally this kind of mb does not have the option of usb/firewire in the bios.  </s>
<s> means the bios cannot detect the dvd burner from the firewire port.  </s>
<s> you are forgetting about how the classic pc works or the history from the original to how it is today.  </s>
<s> you seem to be expecting something that is and was never a feature of your classic pc. tell more why you expected this to be found in the bios.  </s>
<s> i read your post and see no question.  </s>
<s> end your question with a question mark next time.  </s>

<s> it's not a feature of most pcs so nothing busted.  </s>
<s> did you need a history lesson on the personal computer?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the bios cannot detect it, ... does this computer support firewire?  </s>
