<s> i just finished building my pc and everything works; power switch, fans, leds, you name it.  </s>
<s> i connected the monitor to the graphics card using hdmi to dvi respectively, and i get no signal on the monitor. the cpu led is also constantly on red.  </s>
<s> i'm 100% certain the cpu is put in right.  </s>
<s> it is an amd phenom ii x4 3.4ghz.  </s>
<s> is the bios on the motherboard compatible with the cpu?  </s>
<s> do i need a new motherboard? the motherboard and cpu are both socket am3+.  </s>
<s> i'm also using an ssd, which i know is working because of the led inside.  </s>
<s> i tried it on a different monitor as well, using dvi to dvi.  </s>
<s> i can't tell but it sounds like you put it all together rather than using the bare minimum parts to get a beep or a display.  </s>
<s> start smaller.  </s>
<s> if no display, remove parts to get just a beep.  </s>
<s> led's mean nothing.  </s>
<s> you learn this after a few rounds.  </s>
<s> i have the motherboard, processors, power supply, memory, ssd, optical drive, and graphics card installed in the case.  </s>
<s> what should i remove?  </s>
<s> but i guess it was unclear.  </s>
<s> we start as small as possible.  </s>
<s> all i need is 4 parts to get a beep.  </s>
<s> psu, cpu+hsf and the speaker.  </s>
<s> no beeps and i'm looking at the bad or badly configured parts.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> and what does the beep signify?  </s>
<s> it's a shame you didn't reveal the test result.  </s>
<s> if we move this slowly i may have to write to take it to a shop.  </s>
<s> love to help you along, but let's move a little faster.  </s>
