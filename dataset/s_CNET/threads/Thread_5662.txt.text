i have an amd athlon 3200+ processor with a soyo mobo. i was playing with the bios settings and put the cpu fps speed at 200mhz from 166 mhz and the cpu ratio at 11. now my monitor doesn't display anything. has my graphics card died?(i have a geforce 5500)has my ram run into problems? did my processor die? is it a bios problem???what can i do to fix it?????? pre-overclock my cpu was running at a max of 56 c/132 f. thanks for any help you may have; i've really done it this time.
to the defaults, to start over. be aware that as you increase the speed of the memory bus you also proportionately increase the 33 mhz pci bus speed and the 66 mhz agp bus. thus it is not easy to tell which device couldn't handle the speed change. most overclocking of the memory bus is done 1 mhz at a time and test the system for a while after each step. 166 to 200 is simply one big step.
turn off your machine,take the battery out of your mobo,wait,then put it back.this will reset the board....
