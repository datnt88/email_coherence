i purchased a computer from gateway.com and it was to come with an ati x1950 xtx video card. it came installed with a x1900 card. this was 2 months ago and i am still fighting with them to get the right card. the card they sent in my system is worth 1/2 the card i paid for. if you purchased from gateway you better open your case and see what they gave you!!!!!! i hope you got what you paid for. i did not!!
if so it's usually not too late to lodge a complaint there to get your money back. yes you do have to return the pc too. bob
i paid with my debit card. i contacted the bbb about it and gateway responded to bbb that i ordered a x1900. the x1900 was not even an option on the system.( i have my order form) i explained that to the bbb. waiting for final response. anyway beware!!!!!
