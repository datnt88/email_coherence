hey guys, i have following questions about my pc. 1.what can i use to clean the dust of the components and the case, i normally used a normal vacuum but now i read it can damage the components. 2. one of the side panels are falling off due to the glue failure, what glue can i use to get it back on, and that will last, the panel is pretty heave since its aluminium. 3. how can i upgrade to 3.0 usb from 2.0 usb. i have a dell xps 730x 1.intel core i7 920, 2.67 ghz 2.ram 6bg ddr3 at 1066mhz 3.nvidia gtx280 4.western digital 500gb 5.creative sound blaster x-fi thank you guys!
i have never heard of using a vacuum cleaner to blow the dust away would be harmful. also i have never seen a case where glue are use for the side panel (some detail is missing here), i probably would go with epoxy. as for usb 3.0, see what connection is available on the computer then get a usb3 adapter for it. i would think pcie 4 or 16 or sata connection should do it.
1.what can i use to clean the dust of the components and the case, i normally used a normal vacuum but now i read it can damage the components. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use canned air or a some compressor if you like, just don't get wild in its use. don't &quot;weeeee&quot; the fans or blow-off the jumpers. i suspect you use the vacuum cleaner in &quot;blower&quot; mode should be an issue. 2. one of the side panels are falling off due to the glue failure, what glue can i use to get it back on, and that will last, the panel is pretty heave since its aluminium. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any decent glue or some expoxy should do, follow it instructions. there nothing to stop you from &quot;jerry-rigging&quot; a solution. 3. how can i upgrade to 3.0 usb from 2.0 usb. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you have an empty slot install a usb 3.0 card of good quality, don't be cheap, as they have issues you'll soon find out otherwsie. tada ------willy
