(my ipad2 with play them seemlessly!) that is really the reason i want to upgrade. is a athlon ii x2 with 2 or 3gb ram going to cover my needs? what else might i want to do that this level of pc won't handle? a lenovo with the athlon ii x2 (only a 180w power supply??) mini tower is only $350- from newegg it has onboard ati radeon 3000 graphics as well. really need help! thanks...

(compare all the various amd cpus) tada -----willy
