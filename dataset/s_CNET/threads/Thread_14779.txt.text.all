<s> how can i get my old but trusty 4050n hp printer to work with my new computer that has no parallel port?  </s>
<s> i have some other ports on the back of the printer.  </s>
<s> two kind of look like those used to connect up a monitor.  </s>
<s> another looks like a ps2 port i think it is called that was used and i guess still is used to connect a keyboard or mouse.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help, dave  </s>
<s> cross posting found at  </s>
<s> you could try a parallel to usb adapter, that is a maybe.  </s>
<s> if the printer software is not compatible with the os and there isn't a driver package update from the manufacturer (hp)you likely have a sea anchor, good luck!!!  </s>
