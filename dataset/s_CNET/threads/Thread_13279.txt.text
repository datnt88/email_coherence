we have 2 computers (1 has an xp pro os while the other has a win98 se os) that are connected to the net via a cnsh-800 8-port switch that is hookup to a dsl modem-router. our problem is that the connection between the switch and our win98se pc has somehow stop working. no, it doesn't have anything to do with the lan card or the utp wire being busted because when we tried to hook them up directly to the dsl modem-router, we could still get a connection. i think the same is also true for the switch because the connection between it and our xp pro pc still remains unaffected. so my question now is this: where do you think our problem lies? do you know of any solution to fix it?
eventhough you said you have no problem with your utp, try other cable... it maybe loose or burnout connector..
thanks for the reply gakada. the switch ports are ok when i tested them all using the utp cabble hook up to our xp pro pc. as for the utp cable hookup to our win98se pc, it works just fine when i connected it directly to the dsl modem-router instead of the switch so i don't think it has something to do with the problem. one more thing, the switch, the utp cable, and dsl modem-router are all new. not even a week old yet. they even all work just fine until yesterday when i found out that i could no longer access the net via the switch using our win98se pc. by the way, our dsl provider assigned to us one static ip address. but since we have to 2 pcs i made use of the switch to share the internet connection so i won't have to setup a network with one pc depending on another to get access to the web. just assigned ip addresses to both with the first one having a 192.168.x.xx address while the second one having 192.168.x.xx+1 address. any more ideas guys?
gakada, i guess i made a hasty conclusion with regards to your suspicion that i maybe having a loose connector. kinda just found out that when i checked my rj45.
