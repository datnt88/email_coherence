<s> can anyone suggest a good movie maker that will play a song in the intro all the way thur?  </s>
<s> i had roxio on my old computer, and it was great had no problems.  </s>
<s> i broke down a got the easy cd&dvd burning (roxio).....well guess you get what you pay for, i hated it, just a played short intro song, but even so it was a lame program, i uninstalled.  </s>
<s> window's movie maker just plays a short intro,about a verse and starts over.  </s>
<s> any other movie maker program anyone can suggest, don't know if i want to go back to using roxio products, the reviews are not to good, especially for vista users.  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> try renaming that file to .wma and see if that works.  </s>
<s> sounds good, but can you explain how i rename - would you give me a example what i'm would be doing, were to go etc. if i can do this with windows movie play that would be great.  </s>
<s> to use the audio track of a wmv file as the audio for a wlmm project, simply rename the file so the extension is wma.  </s>
<s> wlmm will accept and use it.  </s>
<s> rename a dv-avi file so it has a .wav  </s>
<s> extension and it also works as the audio track of a wlmm project.  </s>
<s> rename the same dv-avi file so it has a .wma  </s>
<s> extension and works too. the bottom line seems to be... take any video file you want to use as the audio track and rename the extension to any of them that wlmm likes, and it might work fine.  </s>
<s> if it can, wlmm uses the audio stream from the video file.  </s>
<s> renaming a file is easy to find tutorials on.  </s>
<s> not to sound mean or anything but the helpers in the forums are volunteer so please research the easy stuff on google, etc. the trick i noted is not easy, not well known and a good question.  </s>

<s> thanks guys, i just i installed nero 9 reloaded.  </s>
<s> i did try renameing the file but did not work for window's movie maker so the intro song would play all the way thru.  </s>
<s> sorry for the lame ??'s, but do appreciate people like you that take the time to help others and i'm learning until we meet again and hope not to soon.  </s>
<s> again super thanks!!  </s>
