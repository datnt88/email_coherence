does it really worth all that money? or should i go for an ibook? thanks
is the imac worth every penny? the simple answer is no. no product i've purchased has fulfilled this question. i have however revceived sage advice over a meal that i've paid for and that was worth more than the pennies i paid. bob
except it's not really comparable as one's a desktop and one's a notebook. one's a g5 and one's a g4, etc. might be better to compare an imac with an emac or an ibook with a powerbook. but even then, you get what you pay for. more or less.
