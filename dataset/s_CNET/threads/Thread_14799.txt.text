i'm considering buying an hp a350n. at $999 minus a $50 rebate, it seems like a lot for the money. any opinion? also, will a dvd+rw disc play on the typical dvd player? thanks
i just paid $119 for some 8x dvd plus and minus rw recorder. that drive is going to annoy you since you can't create a dvd-r disc. tell them that you want an all-format dvd recorder. bob
beware of this product!!! see my review on cnet. i got two that were defective right out of the box. i gave up on h-p after wasting many hours of my time, including several hours on the phone with h-p's technical support. a dvd+rw disk will not play in the typical dvd player. i have tried it on several myself. - nard
hmm, i am planning to get the new model pavillion a4** custom assembled at hp. i wonder if that new product line would be better than the a3** line.
hp has a bad habit of sticking with a &quot;standard&quot; in their company even if the customers are screaming. in this case its dvd plus r/w drives. you will not be happy with just a plus drive and you will be told by hp (or any sales-droid) that plus will be all you need. given that i can buy an all format 8x dvd recorder for under 149 bucks, this is a piece of the machine that is definitely out of tune with today. bob
i note that even the dell 4600 dvd burner is a plus only drive. what computer manufacturers offer dvd +/- drives? thanks for your help.
i'm not sure what manufacturues will offer a multi-format, but if you can get them to leave out the dvd+rw, and thus leaving an empty drive bay, you can just have one added in by a store like circuit city or compusa, or you can install one yourself, if you know how...
