does anyone have any idea how a jaton geforce 5700 pci (not pci-e) would compare to an ati radeon 9250? i have a radeon 9250 256 mb card installed, but am wondering if the jaton geforce 5700 pci might be better...anyone have any clue what might be better?
a geforce 5700 more/less comparable to a radeon 9500.
if you can't afford a bigger jump, like a 6600gt, i personally wouldn't bother. but that's me and it's your money. check tom's hardware for comparisons. chuck
there was a 5700ultra, 5700, and 5700le. the latter is still in production in light numbers. i picked up a bfg 5700le and oc'ed it to 450/550 with stock cooling. it played call of duty, metal of honor, and in the upper settings. now its sitting in my junk box until i install it in my older dell. the 9250 is much slower. it doesn't even have a fan. stick with the 5700le, which is much better.
i have a 9250 and dispite its age, i think its still one of the better pci cards left. i play world of warcraft with most display setting on the max and it preforms fine.
