i have a large home with very thick walls. is it worth paying extra to buy a business grade wap such as the cisco aironet 1041n over a consumer grade router such as the e4200? any thoughts or suggestions on other routers? thanks
it will more than likely make no difference. almost all routers transmit at the legal maximum power. they all transmit and receive the data in exactly the same format. business equipment generally has features that would not be used by home users. things like multiple ssid and vlan support and radius support etc. one feature related to power is the ability to dynamically reduce the power to allow load sharing of users between groups of ap. the best solution to a house with thick wall is to use directional antenna. you concentrate the power in the direction of the walls. it is a trade off, you will then get less signal in other directions. generally the best solutions to coverage issues is to run multiple routers.
waps and wifi routers (which i can configure to be a wap!) are already at the max power allowed. i can only guess no one has shared this and the seller is more than willing to sell you anything without telling you this. why are the other solutions such as wifi routers configured as waps and ac power line networking not an option? bob
