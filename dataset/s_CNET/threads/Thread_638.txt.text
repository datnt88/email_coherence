i have dlink dsl modem belkin pre n router 1 wired desktop and three wireless laptops all working just fine. i have 1 wireless desktop when it boots up is ok after 1 min it can not get internet access with ie or im. if i ping google it comes back ok, any help would be fantastic. all pc win xp pro. belkin router has dhcp turned on.
outline here:  you likely have some bugs crawling around. i might install firefox by mozilla as an alternative to ie.
i had the same problem but with different hardware. after reading through various posts it was clear that the 'secured' network was the issue. i disabled security and enabled mac filtering. never had a problem since. try it, it might work for you.
i used the tools and found a virus called mouse.exe once deleted the pc found the web. thanks for your help
