ok boys and girls, i have a few questions. i have a dimension 4700 and i'm thinking about a few upgrades. first, i'll tell you what and how i have it running. here are my specs: 4700 ram: 2 x 512 433mhz ddr2 interrogated video intel pentium iv 3.4 ht 140 gb hd running vista enterprise (same as ultimate, minus media center) i tried to max it out as best as possible when i bought it. now as to what i want to put in it. i'm planning on adding 2 extra gigs of ram 2 x 1gb. here is the url for the product.  now i don't think i will have a problem. they match specs with the exception that this runs at 533 and the ram in the system is running at 400-something. from what i understand, it'll just run at the slower speed, right? now a graphics card is needed. this is the one i had in mind.  again, i have the pcie card, so there shouldn't be a problem. my only concern is my 305watt power supply. i don't use all the features with the computer (all 6 usb ports) and things like that, so i'm not too worried. so at the end i'm hoping to have these specs dell 4700 ram: 3 gb 2 x 1 gig and 2 x 512 video: geforce 7600gs 256 mb pentium iv 3.4 does that sound like a mean system or what?? what you you all think? will i have issues with those parts? anything i should know? should i pull out the 512mb ram cards and leave it with 2 x 1gb or will it be fine with all four dimms taken? thanks for all the advice. jf
your ram choice is fine as long it supports ddr2-533, but you need to determine what your current ram is running at. ( cpu-z can figure it out for you.) the dell comes with ddr2-400 or ddr2-533, not ddr2-433 (which doesn't exist). personally, if you're running ddr2-400, i'd dump the existing ram and use all ddr2-533. as for the graphics card, what do you plan to use the pc for? the 7600gs is an entry-level 3d card, can play some games, and will work fine with your 300w power supply. this evga 7600gs is a better buy at $85 before $20 rebate. if you don't plan on playing an games and don't like rebates, this evga 7300gt is $66 straight up.
get what your mobo support. some memory can be touchy. you can buy 433mhz ddr2 in 1gb sticks. good choice to max it out. your video card choice is also a good upgrade, especially at 256. some will argue for ati. consider a good replacement p/s if the dell shows any age/wear but their supplies are better than the watts shown. but a really good supply is a positive upgrade to consider. past that a new mobo and a core duo would be next and what you buy now will be usable.
i'm pretty sure it's ddr2-400. i bought it over two years ago. as for what i use the pc for, i usually use it for school work and some games. i used to play america's army, before it got too intense for the integrated video. same thing with war rock. i'm really looking for something that i can play some games and have enough. oh and get out of vista basic hell! i have a laptop that has a geforce 6150. that has actually made it like night and day when switching back and forth. so i'm hoping a 7600 will be even better.
dell dimension 4700:  crucial.com says:
evga cards are good overclockers so you can get more performance easily if you wish. this evga 7600gt is another option for $110 before $20 rebate. a 350w power supply is recommended but i've seen folks use in dells without any issue. anything faster than a 7600gt will require a new power supply though.
