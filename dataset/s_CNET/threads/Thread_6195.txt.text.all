i have a question. 
my building has wireless access via a hotspot from a non-for- profit agency that registered the ssid. 
an electric block occurred and for a second thursday morning, knocking out the lights and forcing my pc to re boot. 
after that i havent been able to connect toward the net. 
my connection tells me its acquiring for an ip address. 
i tried to put non valid ip's... it showed a connection but the ip addresses wasnt valid given they wasnt from the routers dhcp. 
given the router for the building isnt within my range so how do i configure this problem? 
do, i talk to the manager about re booting the router or configuring it so the dhcp can send an ip. how do explain this situation to someone who is a newbie toward all things wireless. 
remember i dont have access to the router nor the aps. 
so, im limited in what i can do on my own and trust me, i tried numerous situations. 
any information is appreciated. 
make sure you're within range and try opening a command prompt and type, ipconfig /release and hit enter. 
then type ipconfig /renew and hit enter. 
thanks for responding sir. 
i tried ipconfig. 
didn't work. 
i think its a matter soley on the router then my setup.
