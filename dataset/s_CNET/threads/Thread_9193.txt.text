i'm yugan here. my sony dvd-rom model ddu1621 is 3 1/2 years old. it caused problems. it cant read my recently bought pc dvd games. and some times cant read cd r/rw. please help and reply!
3 1/2 yrs. is a long time for a burner be happy you got good use from it. i suggest you blow it out and use a cd cleaner disk to wipe down the insides as best as possible. that's it, no magic cure, your burner is probably on its last legs and be best to just replace. i'm sure this is an h/w issue from wear&tear from use. tada -----willy
i usually pop in a cd/dvd lens cleaner and if that doesn't work i swap the drive then retest. bob
