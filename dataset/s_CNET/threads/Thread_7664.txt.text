i love my ipad overall but every couple of days i get shut out of a website i like because of flash content. i watch a lot of tennis and just discovered that my subscription to tennistv won't play on the ipad. bummer that means no watching live tennis unless i am at home.
that's sad for now...from a consumer point of view it really makes ipad useless, but html5, h.264 are the future. flash overheats your tablet, doesn't support touch based devices and eats your battery life. webmasters should really move on...anyways someone had to make this step, and youtube,vimeo, netflix, apple and many big names made it. thoughts on flash
apple has already sold 2 million units of ipad in the past 2 months and coservitively may sell 8 million units of ipads by the end of the year. with these kind of numbers it would be crazy for c'net (or someone else) not to come up with a replacement for adobe &quot;flash or reader)! dms
