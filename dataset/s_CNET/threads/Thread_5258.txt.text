i have a microsoft mouse, and it does not scroll properly in itunes... its definitely not an hardware issue as i can scroll in any problem in all other applications eg. firefox, safari... its a microsoft wireless notebook laser mouse 6000. checked with a friend and his microsoft mouse also behaves this way
i didn't install any driver from the included cd or from anywhere else.
im having the same problem with my microsoft wireless notebook mouse 4000, and i have no idea on how to solve. we have to ask microsoft...
i beleive i have tracked it down to one of two services that itunes installs. these are ipahelper and applemobiledeviceservice. it is one of these two causing it. i have suspended both and the mouse movement is smooth again. i just have not taken the time to figure out which of the two it is (since i do not need either to run, i just suspend both). i do have a microsoft wireless laser desktop 6000 with the latest driver versions off the ms site (ver 6.2), so it is not the ms drivers.
install intellipoint onto your machine. copy the the microsoft intellipoint folder from program files to somewhere else. uninstall intellipoint. restart find your mouse in the device manager. update the drivers with the drivers in the intellipoint folder. my mouse scrolls fine now even after a restart.
