hey cnet, i ran a diagnostic test on my laptop because it was having some problems, and it found these errors on the hard drive: error code 0f00:1a44 and 0f00:0244 does this mean that my hard drive needs to be replaced? or can i reformat it and it'll be ok? it still boots up so i can try to salvage some of my files. it's 320g, only about a year old. thanks!
you always do that first. your choice to try the format and re-use. i don't need unreliable parts in my machines. i tend to gift them away. why gift? so there is no doubt that i find the parts to be worthless. bob
yeah, right now i'm running a chkdsk and probably going out to invest in a portable harddrive. gonna throw my files onto that and then reformat...hopefully the drive isn't physically damaged.
