<s> does anyone know if it is necessary to press the power button on the samsung syncmaster px2370 monitor, to completely shut it off?  </s>
<s> if i power down my pc, the monitor goes off/dark on its own.  </s>
<s> when i restart the pc, the monitor comes on without touching the power button.  </s>
<s> if i shut off the px2370 before i shut off the pc, the px2370 won't come on again the next time i restart- i have to push the power button.  </s>
<s> the power switch at the bottom of the screen is the touch sensitive type. is the power completely off or is it using power in the first example?  </s>
<s> i could find nothing in the manual about this topic.  </s>
<s> thanks for any info!  </s>
<s> the vga connection might let the monitor sleep.  </s>
<s> if the monitor turns on when you start the pc then i'll take a guess the monitor is in some sort of standby mode.  </s>
<s> power usage......about a1/2w.  </s>
<s> if you want zero power usage......push the off switch.  </s>
<s> thanks for the info r.proffitt and bob b!  </s>
