<s> i guess everyone knows about the soyo's rebate game that being they don't honor them.  </s>
<s> imo another rebate game is being played by corsair.  </s>
<s> they require a rebate be submitted within seven days.  </s>
<s> (i should have just ordered from newegg or zip-zoom-fly it would have been cheaper in the long run.) i hope microcenter will reconsider with whom they play.  </s>
<s> i encourage everyone to read the policy before thay leave the store.  </s>
<s> dear edward, i have just replied to the email you sent within the hour regarding this issue.  </s>
<s> i agree that the seven day period did not give enough time for the customer to submit the rebate.  </s>
<s> we value your opinion and appreciate your feedback.  </s>
<s> i assure you that all future rebates ran at retail stores will have at least a 14 day or more submission period.  </s>
<s> i apologize for the negative experience that you have had with our rebate.  </s>
<s> please contact me if you have any further questions or comments, my contact information is on my email reply.  </s>
<s> best regards, vivian wang retail account manager corsair memory, inc.  </s>
<s> both microcenter and corsair replied to my emails.  </s>
<s> i'm glad the two quality organizations came through.  </s>
<s> however, i do think a thirty-day submission timeframe would be more reasonable.  </s>
<s> i await the rebate.  </s>
<s> thank you vivian.  </s>
<s> p.s. i bought more corsair ram yesterday.  </s>
