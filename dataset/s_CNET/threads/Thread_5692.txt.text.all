<s> i am in the market for purchasing a new computer.  </s>
<s> i am deciding between a desktop which is upgradable or a laptop which is portable.  </s>
<s> now i am a home user however i want to be able to multi-task and be able to play the latest games.  </s>
<s> i was considering building a pc but i dont want to bother buying parts and what not.  </s>
<s> can someone give me some ideas?  </s>
<s> if you want a pc for multi-tasking, gaming and possibly the option to upgrade, i would suggest buying off well known computer builders, such as mesh, cube24/7 etc (uk companies) its worth a bit of research into the company if you are just searching it on the internet, but a good idea is to go into a magazine shop and look in a computing magazine, they normally have double page ads for computer builders.  </s>
<s> hardware wise - i would look for a core 2 duo/quad, 3gb/4gb/8gb if you want to go all out (ddr2), hdd would be up to you, you would need to know what sort of space you are going to use, 1tb+ should be fine.. and dont forget to make sure it comes with a keyboard, mouse and screen if you are not going to use your old ones.  </s>
<s> posting links to computer you have spotted would be good aswell, i would be happy to look at them and give you my opinion.  </s>
<s> here is an idea as to what i was looking to buy from bestbuy.... or  </s>
<s> yeah, most of them are perfect for what you want  </s>
<s> so tell me....if i was going to choose one of those systems......what do you think is good for playing games?  </s>
<s> obviously, for gaming you want a higher end processor, better graphics card and more ram if possible, so possibly.. - quite expensive, but good aswell and  </s>
