i am currently have and am using a free agent desk 500gb external hard drive with a speed of 7200. i was thinking of purchasing the wd my passport hard drive 250gb which is only $29.99 at target and was wondering how reliable they are compared to the free agent drives. i know that it's has a slower speed but i like the fact that it's usb powered vice a/c/ and is extremely small. i'm just going to be using this as a backup for my mp3 files. also, if someone knows of another good usb powered hard drive please let me know.
they are ok and quite a good idea as a backup copy (but never as &quot;storage&quot;)
thanks again for the reply!
