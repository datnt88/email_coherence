<s> hello, i'm not sure if this the right forum, but hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.  </s>
<s> i work for a company that produces and refurbishes parts for a large printer company.  </s>
<s> some of our jobs involve flashing codes onto printer cpu boards.  </s>
<s> this usually requires installing and uninstalling several hundred boards.  </s>
<s> as you can imagine, the cables become worn out rather quickly, so we are constantly replacing machines.  </s>
<s> does anyone know of any sources for various sized extension cables?  </s>
<s> most of the connectors are side by side (instead of stacked) varying from 4 pin to 12 pin.  </s>
<s> i think replacing cables would be a much simpler solution as opposed to the hacked up splicing we've been trying.  </s>
<s> all thoughts and ideas are appreciated.  </s>
<s> the connectors are basically like what you find on cpu fans.  </s>
<s> there are some 2, 3 and 4 pins.  </s>
<s> a 12 pin resembles three 4 pins layed side by side.  </s>
<s> i hope that makes sense.  </s>
<s> here's where we found pogo pins to be kink on our test fixtures.  </s>
<s> maybe you just need your engineers to make up a better system.  </s>
<s> q. does anyone know of any sources for various sized extension cables?  </s>
<s> a. sorry, no. in our world we craft such things as we are a maker of such things.  </s>
<s> and no, don't ask how much.  </s>
<s> we only do this for in house projects.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> is it possible to replace/repair the actual ends themselves?  </s>
<s> basically, the wires kink and break at the connector from all the pushing and pulling.  </s>
<s> if we could remove the ends and reattach them 1/2&quot; up the wire, that might at least make the machines last a bit longer.  </s>
<s> but the answer is simply yes.  </s>
<s> any engineer or tech can do this.  </s>
<s> it's just a cable.  </s>
<s> make your own?  </s>
