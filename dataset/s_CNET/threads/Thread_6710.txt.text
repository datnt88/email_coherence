hi thanks in advance for any help. i recently tried to upgrade my dell c521 4gb 32-bit, radeon x1300/1550 graphics card with this: sparkle sx98gt512d3l-nm geforce 9800 gt 512mb 256-bit gddr3 pci express 2.0 x16 hdcp ready low profile ready video card - retail from newegg it was a bit difficult to insatll but i pluged it in and turned on the pc....the button usually green is yellow and only the the fan and dvd drive come on..the pc dosent boot up. i was thinking i need to replace the power supply which was 280watt. my warranty recently expired and i'd like to avoid paying $50 only to be told to order a power supply. thanks -t
appears to have a separate power connector on the rear side. it needs a direct connection to the power supply in order to work. did you see it and plug in the connector?
yes i did see it but was not clear what pluged into what. plus the cords didnt strecth. but about the power supply..do you think i need to replace it...is there a &quot;reset&quot; button? all my product doc is on the hard drive, so i cant look anything up.
and it may not have the 6 pin pci express power connector that the video card needs. no, there's no reset button. you may not have zapped the ps but it's a good bet it's under powered for your system now.
so you mean i will have replace power supply?
so then i'll have to replace?
i don't want to sound rude but, if the answer is &quot;no&quot;, the answer to your question should be obvious. if it does have the connector and you haven't plugged it in, the next step to take is also obvious. that's all i can offer. best of luck.
sorry i wasnt clear....i actually pluged in the video card turned on the pc and it ran bu didnot boot up. seconds later i kind of smell a burning smell and tuned it off. the smell was comming from the power supply. i tried to turn it on and and then the fan would only start, and dvd drive. so this is why i'm thinking the power supply?
