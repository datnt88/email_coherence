hi, my external hd (mybook 500) is inaccessible. while i fight to recover its data, i'm looking for a more dependable external hd, of around the same size. the hd is to be connected to an m55e lenovo pc, running winxp pro (sp3). i'll appreciate your recommendations, suggestions or warnings.
these externals are just copies, not &quot;storage&quot; and prone to a much higher failure rate than internals. -&gt; the most common data saving trick i use is to put the hard drive from that old enclosure into a new one. however there are consumers that won't do this and will have to take it to a shop counter or demand the maker recover the data. -&gt; what do i use? hard disks from newegg.com or geeks.com and an enclosure. bob
did i understand you right? do you suggest i take the hd out of the mybook enclosure and put it into a new one? do you suggest buying an internal hd and no an extenral one? if so, can you recommend one (or some)?
q. did i understand you right? a. no. i must have been unclear. q. do you suggest i take the hd out of the mybook enclosure and put it into a new one? a. if you want to try the most common way to gain access to that drive's files. q. do you suggest buying an internal hd and no an extenral one? a. your choice here. i shared that's what i do. q. if so, can you recommend one (or some)? a. drives and enclosures from newegg.com. the selection changes too fast for me to pick one from the few hundreds. bob
