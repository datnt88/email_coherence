6816	9	15957	5087569	177705	william skinner	2/23/11 1:31 pm	1.29846786e12	i have a similar problem	i have a phenom 9850 msi am2+ board. i leave the computer on 90% of the time and built it myself about 2-3 years ago. i came home today and my computer was off. (i thought an automatic update took place and the machine shut off, and just did not start back up) the machine would do the same as your symptoms were. i finally took the side off and found my heatsink was not seated. i went to reattatch it and found a plastic ear was broken. the broken ear is on a square plastic ring about 3 1/2&quot;x 4&quot; held to the motherboard by 4 philips screws. so my question is does anyone sell the square ring by itself? (i have a feeling i'm going to have salvage one from an old amd computer.)

6816	11	15957	5088505	5087569	lacsr	2/25/11 3:33 am	1.29860478e12	considering the problem	look here:  depending on the cpu, intel or amd, and socket type, i have seen these in retail but much to find on ebay.
