i believe i can work off my game card if someone could tell me how to change the bios in my system. i don't know how to access it.
for my compaq, i push f2 to enter setup. however, if the machines is old, just disable the old graphics card in device manager and the new one should already be there in display adapters, no further intervention in thr bios would be necessary. roger
here is a list of the bootkeys for each model of computer. hope this helps, john
