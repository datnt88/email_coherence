hi, i am considering buying the gateway zx 6810 all-in-one pc. would someone be able to advise me if all-in-ones in general or this gateway in particular be susceptible to overheating. i intend to use it in india, where outside temperatures can get pretty hot in summers (going upto 45 celcius). in other words, is over-heating a serious problem with all-in-ones? thanks,
such systems tend to be build that handle any heat build-up be exhausted or radiated away. the makers knows it maybe a problem and thus allow for better static cooling. however, if the environment itself is a threat then consider a system where you can improve on cooling as the all-in-ones aren't that capable of a any cooling upgrades other than external. so, if you buy one, best to use it in a/c cooled room and/or where cooling is in a comfort zone for the pc. this is akk an opinion, as i see it. tada -----willy
i'd be concerned about running any pc in an ambient temperature that high so you're probably right to be concerned. you might want to see if you can find specs for operating temperature (non-condensing) and keep well within that range.
