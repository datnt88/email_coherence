what is a good rated affordable dual layer burner,? 
my plextor is starting to crap out. 
as is my digital camera, my 55&quot; tv, and my radio in my truck. 
mostly from newegg.com but the hp units are most used since we use lightscribe a lot.

i don't look at the brand but i do have a few sony (that's because at the time, it was the least expensive).
