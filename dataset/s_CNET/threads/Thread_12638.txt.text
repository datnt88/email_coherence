i have a generic graphics card with the sis 300/305 chipset ( 32 mb ram ) . recently i upgraded to windows xp and had to download new drivers for the card ( from the sis website ) . the problem is that whenever i run a game in opengl , it is way too dark . with windows 98/me , there was full set of utilities with the driver software that allowed me to adjust the brightness levels . however there is no such feature with the present drivers . as a result , i cannot play any game in open gl , because it is too dark to view . does anyone have any suggestions to correct this problem ?
i can only note  but will not be able to tell you which driver may solve your issue. bob
i had this problem on my compaq. i go to active desktop, customize, settings advanced and there you will find a correction in my case it is called gamma correction but it may be called something else just turn it up.
this may be what you're looking for.
