but i toss old ide drives into usb cases when i need to access them. bob
your specs show no immediate support for pata type(eide) hds. unless, the cd drives have use of an eide port, then you *may* install an ide hd, but it won't be quick or as desirable other than it can be used. if you plan to use some old ide hd, you may have to look at some adapter to attach on ide drive then i/f with sata port. imo, you would be better served simply to have a sata type drive to install.  tada -----willy
if you have the dell xps 600 motherboard nforce4 sli xh241, it sure looks like there is an ide connection. open the case and have a look.
you won't need to change anything, set the jumper on the ide hd to slave. just connect to existing ide cable and reload your xp cd. do a full format, it should work like any other reload.
