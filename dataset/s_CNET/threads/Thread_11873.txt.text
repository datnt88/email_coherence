i added a 400 watt power supply to a system that had a 150 watt power supply in it ! it was from an 700 mhz celeron comp usa home series computer --- everything works fine except, i keep getting these dialog boxes stating that, this program has preformed an illegal operation and will be shut down -- if the problem persist contact the program vendo. do you think this error is in association with the power supply or could it be the computer has another conflict-- it almost impossible to find a compatable supply because its a mini atx supply and the comp usa replacement is 109 dollars. any technical input would be helpful --- thanks
your issue appears to be a software related problem, not hardware. the programs running at the time of the error message need to be looked at.
in just about all cases of the cited error, by running ad-aware 6, the error goes away. it seems to be a problem when one goes on the internet. norm
