<s> i have never done this, but you can to give it a try.  </s>
<s> check these links:  </s>
<s> even w/o o/c'ing, video issues are a problem should they arise.  </s>
<s> all too often the makers themselves have done alot to give the best performance and more importantly, &quot;stability&quot;.  </s>
<s> o/c'ing will increase unstability and really the reward isn't that much plus you may damage the video chipset or vram. the other poster gave some links, follow them.  </s>
<s> google for overclocker type websites for details, though.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
