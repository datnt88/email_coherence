this is both a peripheral and a software question. having no experience with any of the chat platforms or pc video cameras, i am looking for suggestions on which is the best camera/chat combo to use with my daughter and granddaughter. i am in michigan, she is in montana. we both have pc's running xp, and both have dsl.
is your former question in one of our other forums. that forum wasn't for posing a question as you may have found out. why not one of the packages you see everywhere? as to &quot;best&quot; i think those macintoshes with the builtin camera to be &quot;best&quot; since you don't have to install the camera or software. it just works. bob
yes, i found i had posted in the wrong place, but could not see how to delete the first one. i have used other logitech devices and was satisfied. will the camera come with software so that if i bought two i could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use messenger, icq, yahoo etc.? if so, which one of those should i use?
