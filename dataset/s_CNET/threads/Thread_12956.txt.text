hi guys, my drive gets corrupted and unreadable repeatedly and it's driving me nuts. i was never able to format this hard disk successfully through disk management or the command prompt window. so i ran the hitachi drive fitness test (disk in good condition), had the disk erased, and used maxtor's maxblast to partition and format. but now whatever files i transfer into this particular drive gets corrupted instantly. it either doesn't play or open fully. and after moving some files into the drive and restarting a couple of times, either of the follow messages shows when i attempt to access the drive: - the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable - the disk structure is corrupted and unreadable i'm not worried about recovering the data now... i just want the damn drive to stop getting corrupted/unreadable/unstructured. anyone know what's wrong?
how old is the pc and the mb bios ? how big is the hdd ? vapcmd
oh tks for reminding me to check my bios mate! turns out the cause of it was an outdated bios... really appreciate the help man. have a nice day ^^
feedback, we'd never have any idea of the outcome. vapcmd
