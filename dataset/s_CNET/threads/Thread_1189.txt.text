hi, there, well my 40 and 60 gig drives are full up, and rather than clean them out i think i'll just add another drive. i am thinking of a 120 gb seagate drive . . . but one version is 2 mb buffer and the other is 8. i am not a gamer. which should i get? --fj
8 is always better than 2 especially if it costs is the same.
ah, but it doesn't cost the same, the 8 mb is another 20 bucks i think. maybe 40. do i need it??
i was there at office max with 160gb hard disks going for $59. (after rebate) you may want to just keep shopping. bob
i was watching a tech-tv show a while back and they were talking about hd's and ata100 vs ata133. what they were saying was in their tests they saw very little diff. however they did see a diff with hd cache size, bigger is better. so if you want to run the tech-tv benchmarks get the bigger cache. do you need the bigger cache to run your stuff?? i have no idea. i'm thinking most folks won't see a diff.
a one year warranty and the 8 meg cache gets you a three year warranty. you might want to consider that too.
8 megs, as has been stated, is preferred but you will see no difference in performance if the drive is just used for storage. as i understand it, performance improvements only happen when you run programs from the drive and the correct data is cached.
ok the skinny! if you like to game 8meg cache or, if you like to have multiple windows open and do not have a lot of memory onboard also go with the 8meg cache otherwise the only other reason to have it is for the future when you will do these things and need it. also the warranty is much better because the drive is not taxed as much with the 8meg cache. whereas the 2meg cache must work more often to do the same work read/write or i/o if you prefer.
