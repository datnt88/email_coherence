i have a canon pixma mp780 all in one, and the scanner is stuck at one end and will not move. when i try to scan or copy all i hear is loud clicking from the cables that move the scanner, and a message that says &quot;scanner error.&quot; the cable that is hooked to the scanner seems to be plugged in-i took off the right side of the printer where the motherboard is. i need this to fax and scan docs, so any help would be much appreciated.
i couldn't find any discussion specifically about this failure but hope this helps you in disassembly and reassembly if you want to look inside. bob
is this something that just started? you didn't mention os or computer hdwe being used. did you try uninstalling and reinstalling the software? that would be the first thing to try, assuming that nothing has been changed, hdwe, software or operating system.
