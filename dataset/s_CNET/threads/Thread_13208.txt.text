i have a tw roadrunner cable internet connection and average about 5000 kbps speeds (when the computer is wired directly to the modem). i add a netgear wgt624 router to connect a ps3 & xbox and average about 2000 kbps at my computer. i took these speeds when the game systems were turned off. i do not use the wireless option on this router. this is more of a drop than expected. what type of ethernet cables should i use? will cat6 cables help? should i upgrade my router? thanks in advanced
while i will comment you have a bargain or cheap router that takes a bite out of the speed you might boost it if you can install openwrt in that router. sadly it's not the cables. then again i wonder if you tried it with the wifi disabled. i can't count the time i found moochers on the wifi. bob
bob is pretty much right about your hardware but you could use cat 6 cable, instead of cat 5 and it might help a bit.
crase & proffit, thanks for the help. do you have any good router suggestions? i need a microsoft xbox approved router. i have found (from experience) that the xbox is picky and needs a compatible router or it will not work.
&quot;wgt624 (v2)
yes, i have the (v2) with the newest firmware...i purchased this model because it was on the xbox list. i never use my wireless, so i took the advice and disabled it. looks like i am getting better speeds (high 3000-low 4000 kbps). my home backs up to a school parking lot, maybe i did have some moochers. still curious on what routers are recommended. my router is about 4 years old.
if you look into this a bit deeper you find the newer revs of that router use a higher speed cpu. not long ago they were not using the faster chips. borrow anyone's router?
