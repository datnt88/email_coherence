<s> the p3 topped out at 1ghz.  </s>
<s> there was a 1.26ghz, 512kb cache p3 chip but it was a rare beast and was not supported by most chipsets.  </s>
<s> a 1.2ghz celeron may work, but it really won't provide any performance boost.  </s>
<s> you could find and plug in the sligthly faster p3 that did fit the socket, the bios may balk and the power supplies may not be up to the task.  </s>
<s> don't do this.  </s>
<s> look to other areas for a little speed such as enough ram for the os in use and maybe a video card upgrade.  </s>
