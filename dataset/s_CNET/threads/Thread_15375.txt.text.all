<s> looking for netbook for dad, key needs normal keyboard & screen (preferrance), hard disk 40gb or more, windows os. as it is for checking mails only and mostly at home use no need for great battery or light weight or looks.  </s>
<s> max 450$.  </s>
<s> netbooks, by definition, have a smallish screen and a smallish keyboard.  </s>
<s> so your requirements aren't quite clear.  </s>
<s> why not specify a minimum and maximum size (10&quot;, 11&quot;, 13&quot;, 15&quot;) or resolution (800x600) for the screen, and a minimum widt (in inches or centimeters for the distance between q and ?  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> thanks for the great replay.  </s>
<s> i understand all netbooks are generally 10&quot; but seen few like lenovo ideapad s10 which are 12&quot; (like standard laptop).  </s>
<s> so i was looking for something which is more like standard laptop is screen and keyboard perspective but low end for just mail check.  </s>
<s> - calls it's 10&quot; machine a netbook, everything bigger (up from 11.6&quot;) a laptop.  </s>
<s> - lenovo calls it's 12.1&quot; machine still a netbook.  </s>
<s> - wikipedia says: by mid 2009, cnet noted &quot;the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other,&quot;[1] noting &quot;the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices.&quot;  </s>
<s> so what's in a name?  </s>
<s> don't shop for a certain class of devices, shop for what you need.  </s>
<s> luckily, i see you found one you like.  </s>
<s> nothing wrong with lenovo, of course.  </s>
<s> did you see and touch it already in a shop?  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> no i have neither saw or used it, nor i have decided on one particular brand.  </s>
<s> so to not to get into defination of netbook or notebook.  </s>
<s> my need is, i am looking for one 12&quot; portable machine.  </s>
<s> can you suggest few options (amx 450$) which fits the bill?  </s>
<s> (netbooks, notebook, laptop..)  </s>
<s> not from personal experience.  </s>
<s> but searching laptop 12&quot; in google finds some hits to shops that have it from hp, lenovo, dell, acer, asus, fujitsu, toshiba.  </s>
<s> don't fully trust those shops.  </s>
<s> visit the websites of the makers also.  </s>
<s> hope there are one or more you like.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
