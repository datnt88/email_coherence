i just wanted to know what's the advantages of having a printer that is network ready and one that doesn't? thank you mike
network ready usually means that it has a lan connection device, such as an hp jetdirect card in it already. this lets you connect a cat5 cable to it, connect to a hub or switch and print to an ip address. no pc is required to be on for this to work. some printers may say &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;capable&quot;. make sure if you want the lan connection it does in fact have the lan (ethernet) connection already installed.
mikey you asked essentially this same question on july 30, over in computer newbies is there something that the 3 responses there did not answer?
