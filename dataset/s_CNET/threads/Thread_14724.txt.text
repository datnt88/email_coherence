hi all, sorry if this has been asked to death but here is my situation. i've set-up a home network with two xp machines and one win98 machine, which is connected to the house's printer. i am currently able to print through the network from the two xp nodes, but only when the win98 machine is on. so everytime i want to print, i have to run down two floors, turn on the old system, wait for it to boot (5+ min), then print. is there a way to set-up the printer so i don't have to turn on the win98 machine and just leave the printer on 24/7 ready to print from the xp machines? it's done in offices, is it not? thanks.
i need a print server don't i?
since you already have a working network, just put your printer directly &quot;on the wire&quot;. you didn't say what type of connection your printer has, but even if it's parallel, you can buy one for about $50-$75 that goes from parallel (usb,ect) to rj45 (lan cable)and has a web based interface to setup. i've use in an office environment and it worked well. good luck. (an example:)
