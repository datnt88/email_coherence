hi i want to upgrade my p/s but i want to know if its going to be compatible with my mobo. right now i have one of 200 watts and i'd like to get one of at least 400 watts or maybe more. what should i know before doing such step and what brands are reliable? operating system windows xp compaq presario s3100nx amd athlon xp2200+ 1.8 ghz pga462 socket a total expansion slots (3) pci (1) agp 4x 1.5v hope this info can be enough and thanks for any help.
well good brands would be ocz, antec, enermax, and some thermaltake units. take a look at newegg.com
everyone should replace the psus in oem pcs. (imo) it will be quieter, more stable, create less heat and make ur pc happy. konny
i was surprised that it came with a lite-on psu. really junk though. but even more surprising is it comes with dual +12v rails. but still the psu is crappy with very low +12v rail voltages. but its 400watt and has dual +12v rails, pretty good. this is the compaq sa4000t roger
a 450 psu should be more than adequate. i am over here in the uk and h/w is more expensive. i bought a new pc case which inclused a 450w psu and found it was a better idea as the price of both was little more that the stand individual psu i would have bought regards ........ john
