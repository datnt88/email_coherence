<s> i have a macbook pro with the above mentioned graphics card.  </s>
<s> there are several stories and a statement from nvidia re a high failure rate?  </s>
<s> does anyone have more information?  </s>
<s> are all the chips bad?  </s>
<s> my mac is not coverage by applecare, should i be concerned?  </s>
<s> neither apple nor nvidia have confirmed this for us.  </s>
<s> apparently, many nvidia graphics cards are subject to manufacturing defects.  </s>
<s> as such, they could fail after certain periods of use.  </s>
<s> i have heard that the supposedly affected 8400 and 8600 cards actually belong to computers built by dell and hp; apple may not have them.  </s>
<s> no one knows if all of the chips are bad.  </s>
<s> some people say that their nvidia-equipped macbooks are failing, but they are in the minority (so far).  </s>
<s> mine works perfectly, and many others do too.  </s>
<s> if your macbook works fine, i wouldn't be concerned.  </s>
<s> if apple orders a recall, then it should cover all affected notebooks, covered by applecare or not.  </s>
<s> you can only wait and see.  </s>
<s> -bmf  </s>
<s> it's true.  </s>
<s> there is a serious problem and i know from experience: two replaced mbp logic boards and it's still dead but now out of warranty.  </s>
<s> if ur screen goes dark on boot and os only sees the nvidia chip as the intel one, u know u got the bug. the only fix is logic board replacement.  </s>
<s> did that twice, as apple just replaces with the same board and they only last x amount of months.  </s>
<s> total hose job for hundreds of users so far.  </s>
<s> i had to get an imac to get some work done, the mbp is sitting in a box.  </s>
<s> of course this is your choice here.  </s>
<s> well its out of warranty now, and they don't even sell applecare here in this country (no one is authorized for it).  </s>
<s> i guess if there is a class action i can join:)  </s>
<s> i cannot get applecare out of warranty.  </s>
<s> it is over 1 yr old.  </s>
<s> &quot;the applecare protection plan offers global repair coverage.  </s>
<s> you can either go to an apple retail store or contact apple for information on how to obtain service.  </s>
<s> service will be limited to the options available in the country where service is requested.  </s>
<s> service options, parts availability, and response time vary according to country.  </s>
<s> please see the applecare protection plan terms and conditions for complete details.&quot;  </s>
<s> each one of us makes our choices.  </s>
<s> you made yours so i'm unsure what your question is here.  </s>
