<s> i was hoping to get some reviews/suggestions on external hard drive enclosures.  </s>
<s> i have a ton of hard drives just sitting around and i would like to use them to back up my computer.  </s>
<s> i haven't been able to find solid reviews on them however.  </s>
<s> i have been looking intently at these two: 1. ams venus ds-2316b2bk 3.5&quot; usb 2.0 black external enclosure 2. vantec nexstar 3 nst-360u2-rd 3.5&quot; usb 2.0 external enclosure does anybody have any experience with these?  </s>
<s> do i really need a fan?  </s>
<s> will an alluminum case be enough?  </s>
<s> are there better ones out there?  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> i'd say go for the ams venus.  </s>
<s> i got a 200 gig running in a venus caseing and it is sweet.  </s>
<s> get a little warm if i forget to shut it off but it's nothing out of the norm.  </s>
<s> another thing is it's real quiet too and if we're talking about the same models since i'm too lazy to do a google and check the fan is a nice feature.  </s>
<s> a few down sides to the venus is it's not exactly what you would concider 'shock proof'.  </s>
<s> this is due to the design of the drive. the hdd screws on top of the fan which screws into the caseing from the back.  </s>
<s> if this is for a sit and light travel but mostly for sitting and collecting dust highly recommended.  </s>
<s> vantec...i stay far far away from these.  </s>
<s> not from personal experience but a good friend of mine who gets a new hdd and enclosure every 6 months has nothing but burning hatred toward vantecs.  </s>
<s> according to him the two vantec enclosures he bought failed and took the hard drives along with it.  </s>
<s> meaning nothing was salvageable cept screws.  </s>
<s> well that's my two cents  </s>
<s> that's really interesting.  </s>
<s> thanks for the info.  </s>
<s> i've kind of been leaning towards the ams anyway due to the fan.  </s>
<s> i'm not 100% sure i need it, but i guess it gives me one more piece of security.  </s>
<s> don't know if u want to shop around but the mad dog 3.5 enclosure w/ the usb and firewire connection has been good to me for about 6 mo.  </s>
<s> now, with no signs of wear.  </s>
<s> no real heat buildup to speak of, provided your just using it to back up files ect..no fan in it either though, but for the price, $42.00 where i got it,it has been a trooper.  </s>
<s> nice and quiet also,and pretty shock resistent (i've move or kicked it at least 4-5 times).hope  </s>
<s> this helps.  </s>
<s> they're all aluminium and they handle hdds up to 1tb.  </s>
<s> they're about $40.00 at buy.com ...best delivered price source i've found.  </s>
<s> thanks for the information, but what few reviews i have found on the adaptec said that they tend to run hot.  </s>
<s> also, i guess buy.com raised their price to $45 for what it's worth.  </s>
<s> put a raptor in there but i have three of the adaptec enclosures ....2 of the acs-100s and acs-200 ((?) the one for the 2.5&quot; hdds) and never had any problems with any of them.  </s>
<s> i use them primarily for extra image backups and data transfer between home and work pcs.  </s>
<s> key is they work reliably and with all my systems and handle hdds up to 1tb.  </s>
<s> many of the others don't work with hdds over 300 or 400gbs.  </s>
<s> at the time i got the notebook hdd...i had trouble finding any 2.5&quot; enclosure that handle 2.5 hdds over 80gbs.  </s>
<s> here's another enclosure that looks interesting...i have an external usb by bytecc also ... but this case looks interesting.  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> thanks, i'll check them out some more.  </s>
<s> i'm just struggling with it, because i hear all this stuff about problems and unreliability.  </s>
<s> it just makes me nervous.  </s>
<s> maybe that's a good thing.  </s>
<s> in all my life i have never crashed a computer or lost a drive...knock on wood.  </s>
<s> i should quit reading these forums.  </s>
<s> they are making me paranoid.  </s>
<s> all this talk of drives failing has got me questioning myself.  </s>
<s> here was my original plan: 1. used external enclosure to back up my system.  </s>
<s> 2. pull out hard drive, box it, and put it in my safe deposit box.  </s>
<s> 3. install second hdd and backup again.  </s>
<s> now even as i write this i'm pretty sure its a stupid question, but if there is a failure of the external drive, there shouldn't be any problems pulling the one out of the sdb and reinstalling.  </s>
<s> should there?  </s>
<s> i do have dvd backups, but that sounds like a nightmare to reinstall the kind of info i have from dvd's.  </s>
<s> honestly, if had to backup all at once to dvd's it would probably take me a couple of days.  </s>
<s> but there's lots of good discussion about backup strategies... i always use two internal hdds ... (three including an external hdd which holds a second copy of my backup) and it's worked for me and those i help since 2001.  </s>
<s> i sleep well.  </s>
<s> first hard drive has two partitions .... - partition 1 the os and the apps - partition 2 all data, downloads, updates, etc., second hard drive also has two partitions.... - partition 1 small partition for a swap file - partition 2 large partition for image files of both c: and d: in the event c: becomes corrupt and cannot be quickly fixed thru restore points or other...i get out my ghost 2003 floppy disk and restore c: (the first physical hard drive) from one of the images stored on the 2nd physical hard drive.  </s>
<s> if the first drive dies mechanically ...i get a new drive, install it and restore the images again from the second hard drive.  </s>
<s> if the original hdd is still under warranty ...i send it back and put the warranty replacement on the shelf when it's replaced.  </s>
<s> actually have several spare hdds so the restore is very quick and as easy and painless as a drive failures can be.  </s>
<s> to take it one step further...i copy images of drive c: and drive d: to an external hdd that i can keep safe in my desk at work.  </s>
<s> i also protect the system with a good ups that minimizes data loss and potential corruption from unanticipated power outages.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
