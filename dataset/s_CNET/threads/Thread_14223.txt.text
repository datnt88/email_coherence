zip 100 usb with win xp for some reason one of my zip disks refuses to be recognised by windows explorer. it comes up insert disk or protected. right clicking on any of my zip disks, will not give me the protect/unprotect option. i have downloaded the latest software from iomega but no difference. could this be a dodgy disk ? when i right click this disk and look at properties it says 0 bytes and a file system of raw. any sugestions on recovering this disk.
pick over  to see if you find an answer, but media doesn't last forever... bob
zip drives used to come with software on one of zip disks in the bundle. this disk was the tools disk and was protected as it had the installation software on it. included was a utility to &quot;unlock&quot; the disk so you could use it like any other. is it possible this could be one of those protected disks? if so, iomega software utilities might be able to unlock it. just a thought...good luck.
