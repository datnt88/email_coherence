this usually doesnt happen with computers but i am stumped. last night my pc died on me, no lock up or warning, just turned off. when i went to turn it back on, and in every attempt there after, i get power for all of 1 second. the fans fire up, disk drives light, and thats it. i replaced the power supply not too long ago but it has been working fine for about 3 months. the mother board is getting power, when switched &quot;off.&quot; so im guessing it is not that. any help would be appreciated. xp p4 200mhz 512 self built power supply is 550w did not smell any burn up.
also...i do not get an indicator beeps, and if i try the process immediately...nothing happens.
when faced with a dead as a doornail system i strip it down to 4 parts. 1. motherboard. 2. cpu plus hsf (heatsink/fan). 3. power supply. 4. speaker. no case, no ram, no extra cables. just those four pieces on a square of non-conductive cardboard. i use a jumper to power it up and hope to beeps. power down. if i get beeps i can add a minimum amount of ram and try again... more beeps is good. power down. a video card and hopefully more beeps and a display output. i then move that back to the case and check that no metal standoffs are where they shouldn't be. if you can't get beeps with the 4 items above, then you have narrowed it down to those 4 items are either dead or grossly misconfigured. happy hunting, bob
ok, now if anyone is an optimist out ther i could use some smiles. no beeps, only the same on/off one second burst. with no smell of burning, but with the recent replacement of a burnt up power supply, which should i suspect. the motherboard is an asus p4b533, and the cpu is pentium 4 2.0, not overclocked
if not. do it.
