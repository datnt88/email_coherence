amd athlon 64 3700+, 939pin, san diego, 90nm shuttle sn25p (350 watt psu, nvidia 4ultra mobo) corsair valueselect 2x512 ddr400 pc 3200 seagate barracuda 80gb sata150 powercolor radeon x850xtpe, pci-e plextor px-740a dvd burner sony floppy drive first off will the 350 watts be enough? second the mobo has sata but will it be compatible with 150? next what is the best gcard at about $250 as i think the x850 will most likely be overkill. and lastly does the system components seem to be compatible? thank you all for your help.
i would suggest getting a nvidia card. a nvidia card within your price range would be the 6800.
don't you mean 6800gt, 6800ultra, or perhaps 7800gtx. recommend ocz psu if you can afford. if not, rosewill rp550 atx 550w power supply-57 at newegg.com roger
he has a shuttle that power supply will do fine as sff psus are very powerful despite their wattage and size. look around sfftech. agreed with the dif gpu konny
oh, i see now, he ordered a shuttle barebone. o.o. the x850 will be fine in that with the 350watt psu, as the wattage is more than enough. make sure the card will fit, that's the only comment i have to make. roger
the psu is good enough because m-atx boards don't consume a lot of power. sata 150 is definately supported but you may be thinking of sata 300. that i don't know, maybe not. everything seems to be compatable except maybe the video card and chipset. now i maybe wrong, but i don't know if mixing ati nvidia is ok. also, your card is a two slotter. try this:  hope this helps!
