i reformated my hard drive and now have no sound on my onboard sound card can any one tell me how to find what driver my pc us to use as me and a friend of mine can't find any serial numbers on the board, i know that the board is a 810lr-h i've already tried some drivers but if anyone has a driver that they think works please tell me thanks peter.
or the maker of the pc in order to get the proper driver for the onboard sound. you can also look for the small chipset for the sound if possible. elsewise a pci soundcard works.
tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. when you format the hdd, you wipe everything. you'll need to reinstall all the drivers for the motherboard as well as any perifferals, printers, scanners, modem, etc. if your computer was purchased from a dealer, you should have these on cd. if the machine is older, it is a good idea to go to the mfg. website to find if newer drivers are available. you can google belarc advisor. download and install. it will tell what is inside the box. best of luck
