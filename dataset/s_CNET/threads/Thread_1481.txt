(very wasteful in my opinion making a 20gb drive act like a 10gb drive). i have gone a little further in trying to get it reset to 20gb but without sucess so far. i have tried upgrading the disk's firmware to the latest version and performing a low level format using seagate's sgatfmt4 utility. the format fails when it tries to access areas of the disk that lie outside of 10gb. anyone else got any ideas?
