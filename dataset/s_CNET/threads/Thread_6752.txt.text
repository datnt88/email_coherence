i am looking at getting a 1tb external hard drive. i have been looking at getting a nas for awhile. is the benefits of nas worth a little extra cash and the lack of firewire? nas 1tb  basic 1tb external drive
can you post better ones (i.e. the full link)? kees

1. firewire use of hard drives on windows has resulted in too many wipeouts for me to write it's viable. my advice is to &quot;forget about it&quot; if you are running windows. 2. nas speed is about 1/4 or less the speed of usb speed. while nas is a great thing most have 100 megabit ethernet which pales is comparison to usb 2.0's 480 megabit link. hope this helps you decide. bob
sadly a name i've seen too often at shops with people trying to recover data. i'd go with 500gb today since  shows what happens to many that don't shut down nicely. bob
we have both macs and pc's. also i was thinking about getting a new router with usb port on it for nas. would that work if i just attached a basic external drive to it? like.... apple router
&quot;and it works with both mac and windows. (see system requirements.)&quot; i'm unsure why you asked me. bob
