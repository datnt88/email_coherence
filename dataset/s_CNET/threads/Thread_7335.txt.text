i want to buy a pentium 3 on newegg but they only have them oem. what does this mean. does it at least come with the instructions. the site says processor only.
the p3 has been out of production for years now. but to answer your question, it will be just the chip and nothing else... it's mainly for those that need to fix a machine so no instructions, but look on the web? bob
bob is correct but you need to know if the processor is a coppermine or tualatin core and which your motherboard can support. tualatins were late entries as the p4 release was imminent, as i recall, so older socket 370 boards did not support it. btw, oem means &quot;original equipment manufacturer&quot; which means these are the components pc builders buy in bulk and get a better deal. you don't get the boxed products warranty from intel and you do not get a fan/heatsink. hope that adds some helpful info.
does it at least come with instructions
what instructions are needed? ask here since many forum members have replaced a p3 cpu. bob
making the cpu work and operate at it's potential is dependant on the mb more than anything else. you must insert it properly and cool it. these are &quot;keyed&quot; so you just about can't put it in wrong. you will need to find an adequate fan and heat sink. these are readily available and p3s don't produce the heat p4s do. the fan will probably plug into a mb near the cpu socket. you may have to set jumpers or core voltages but most modern mbs are jumper free and can autodetect the cpu and configure it. you should have a mb manual handy and the web site of the manufacturer is usually a good source for these.
