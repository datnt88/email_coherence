<s> i have a computer i built.  </s>
<s> it has been operating fine for the past two years, however in the last eight months i have gone through 4 power supplies, all of them various brands and from 400 to 600 watt output.  </s>
<s> i have a 1.8 ghz athlon processor, 1.5 gig of memory an asus motherboard, a dvd writer and two 80 gig hard drives with a video and sound card on the pci slots.  </s>
<s> what happens is there is a loud pop and the power supply burns out.  </s>
<s> i took one apart and the fuse inside was blown but after resoldering another fuse in the power supply was still dead.  </s>
<s> this has happened four times now in the past seven or eight months.  </s>
<s> i have had the electric company check my power and they put a recorder on my line and there have been no voltage fluctuations or spikes.  </s>
<s> i just lost another power supply yesterday.  </s>
<s> would appreciate any help or ideas anyone has on this.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> perhaps what you have is a load issue.  </s>
<s> plug&gt;&gt;&gt;bad caps&lt;&lt;&lt;into goggle.  </s>
<s> thanks for your reply.  </s>
<s> i was thinking load issues too which is why i bumped up to the 600 watt power supplies but the one that went out yesterday blew when my computer was in hibernate so i don't think that's it.  </s>
<s> i also looked at the bad caps info.  </s>
<s> i don't see any of that on my board and don't have any of the symptoms they give either.  </s>
<s> according to my motherboard and temp monitoring program my voltages and temps are all well within safe range.  </s>
<s> i am mystified.  </s>
<s> thanks for your help.  </s>
<s> a bad caps issue is also found on other devices.  </s>
<s> for a psu to go, it needs a reason.  </s>
<s> it appears you haven't found the real reason it went bad.  </s>
<s> i suggest you tear down the system and inspect it.  </s>
<s> a bad mounting on the mtrbd.  </s>
<s> and/or chaffed harness, etc. can be a cause.  </s>
<s> you didn't provide details on your system, but if the psu goes, then very possible a device like a cd drive, video card, excessive heat, etc. is faulty.  </s>
<s> you just can't trust *anything* until tested elsewhere.  </s>
<s> afterall, 4 psu going bad suggests that.  </s>
<s> of course, bad ac power is still a possible issue.  </s>
<s> a floating ground, poor connections, or reverse wiring can be a home issue.  </s>
<s> an ac line tester brought at radio smack can see if the wiring is ok. also, if not already a surge protector of decent quality can help.  </s>
<s> if you have one, understand it works usually only once when a true power hit/surge, thus look for a led type telltale showing its active not ac power present.  </s>
<s> alas, an electrician should be called to really check the home wiring for the pc outlet(s).  </s>
<s> good luck tada -----willy  </s>
