i am planning to set up my pc using the intel 2600k processor. (intel 3.4 ghz lga1155 core i7-2600k processor) i am confused which motherboard would be most compatible with this processor. the choice is between - asus p8z68-v pro/gen3 motherboard or asus sabertooth-p67 motherboard ----- rest of my configuration is g.skill ripjawsx ddr3 8 gb (2 x 4 gb) pc ram (f3-12800cl9d-8gbxl) corsair cmpsu-600guk 600 watts psu cooler master haf x ------- thanks in advance for any guidance on this issue. regards
for your intended purpose, i want to offer one tip about asus boards. don't select the ram first. asus will publish which memory has been verified as compatible with each of its motherboards. while it's not always complete or current, it's a good guide to use when going shopping for ram.
friend doesn't go for asus mother. it starts problem after 1-2 years. go for intel.
