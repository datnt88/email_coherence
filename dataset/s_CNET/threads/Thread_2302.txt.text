after trouble free operation of my belkin n wireless modem router, it has suddenly started failing to connect with the internet (the amber internet light is flashing). i have disconnected it and re-connected my old voyager 2091 router which is working perfectly. finding that this worked, i replaced the voyager with the belkin, but it still fails to connect the internet (amber light flashing so i am back on the voyager!). i would prefer to be using the belkin - any suggestions to cure the modem? thanks
for example this can happen on cable modem setups but the details appear to be missing. maybe the belkin is dead, maybe it's the old cable modem issue that we cure a lot. but the details elude me. bob
not in the heart of rural england! it is just called an &quot;belkin n wireless modem router&quot; i think the internet supply is called adsl. i bought it just one year ago but it has not had a lot of use as i ran my voyager for aprt of the time.. is it possible that it could suddenly have died?
ok, with adsl we have to set up the isp details or the light will blink. i can't guess those details and hopefully you have them. bob
i have contacte the belkin help desk, but, after three lengthy emails from them and having followed all their guidance, i still get no contact. however, taking into account that the belkin router will not work on either of my two computers (one is a mac and the others a windows xp) and also that my old router works perfectly on both, it seems likely too me that the router itself has a fault. rather than waste any more time on it, i have decided to cut my losses and dump the router! many thanks for you comments gerald
