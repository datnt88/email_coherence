i have a hd7770 and every time i have a game session after a while the video crash, the image freeze, i have black screen for a couple of seconds, and the game minimizes (display driver amdkmdap stopped responding and has successfully recovered.). i tried all latest amd drivers and with all of them i have this problem, i tested the video card on another pc and works perfectly, i tried to replace the 7770 with an nvidia 280gtx and the nvidia with its drivers do not crash, i also tried different psu on my pc but the problem persists. could this be incompatibility between the video card and the motherboard ? i also noticed it crashes more often with some graphic engines, less with others. os: win7 cpu: i5 2310 motherboard: msi z68a-g43 video card: amd hd7770 ram: 8gb corsair ddr3 (2x4) psu: cx500w
it's rather a famous issue and rarely a motherboard video card issue. your newer users didn't live through the days where ati's drivers would alternatively be bad and good with each version. bob
but i tested the same video card with the same drivers on another pc and works perfectly.
that means very little as the motherboard chipset drivers and install varies so little. why not go with what works? bob
i was reading a review on that video card and there test pcs used 750watt on one and 1000watt on another. this looks like a new system so be sure to ask it's maker or designer why so slim. bob
