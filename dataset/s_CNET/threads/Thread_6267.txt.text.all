<s> i'm wanting to add 1gb in addition to my current 512mb ram in my desktop...but my computer only has 2 slots for ram and both are filled with 256mb dimms. is there something &quot;out there&quot; that can combine both dimms into one dimm slot so that i can add the additional 1gb i want into the other dimm slot?  </s>
<s> by the way, my memory is the pc2100 kind.  </s>
<s> or a single gb dimm these should do fine: given that board you'll need either a single gb dimm (they exist) and one of those 512mb dimms, or to get 2 1gb dimm's and have 2gb i'd just suggest getting two 512mb dimm's  </s>
<s> will your mother board/bios/os support 1 gig of ram?  </s>
<s> your ram speed tells me that the machine is an older model.  </s>
<s> if your setup will support it, then it's purchase time.  </s>
<s> a 1 gig stick and a 512 stick.  </s>
<s> but i've also found that anything over a gig is major overkill.  </s>
