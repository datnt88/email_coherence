<s> just purchased asus netbook, will use for travelling.  </s>
<s> constantly use ms office, outlook, adobe lightroom, ie. what would be the recommended software to install?  </s>
<s> i install and use the same software on my netbook that i use on my laptop.  </s>
<s> why would i change?  </s>
<s> since the netbook's specs is different from a regular laptop, a few applications might run extremly slow.  </s>
<s> what are the applications that you are using anyways just so that we can test if ever.  </s>
<s> i can test this today and am living it.  </s>
<s> our office netbook is used to run out of the office to patch up software in the field.  </s>
<s> we use visual studio and it's not that slow.  </s>
<s> my apologies but for this answer you need to be there, running on the netbook to find that it's not a bad choice.  </s>
