i'm looking to upgrade my current pc (733mhz p3) which i purchased from dell about 5 years ago...i can't afford a whole new system so i'm going to replace the motherboard, cpu and memory for now and replace other components as $ permits... here is what i'm looking at now: mb: asus &quot;p4c800-e deluxe&quot; i875p chipset motherboard for intel socket 478 cpu cpu: intel pentium 4/ 3.2e ghz 800mhz fsb, 1mb l2 cache, hyper threading technology ram: corsair value select 184 pin 512mb ddr pc-3200 i'll also be upgrading to windows xp(from 98se). with the exception of hd's/optical drives everything else is the same as when i got it 5 years ago...am i missing anything??? comments?? thanks
you will need a much larger power supply and plenty of cooling. i'll guess the mb, processor and ram will cost you close to $500 alone. you might through in another 100 for a halfway decent case with some breathing room and ps over 400w. if you want to do more than spreadsheets, web browsing and such, you might want more ram but xp will run ok with 512 megs. your dell box might not fit the mb anyway. have you checked into this?
i figured the power supply would be an issue (the current one is 300-350 i think) an suggestions as far a brand?? i assumed that as long as they were the same form factor that it should fit...i'll have to look into this... thanks
if it was really a 350, but after a year or two, the power supply capacity is a mere shadow of when it was new. there are many articles about this so do not dismiss that its enough. bob
