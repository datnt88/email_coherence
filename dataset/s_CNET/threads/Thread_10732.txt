(you can use different ip address range, to disable the lan connection, without breaking the internet connection) but, if you create a workgroup (even using different workgroup name from the other pc).. then you still can be seen by all connected pc on the lan. i.e.: i have several pc's, connected through lan (all windows xp pro), i have 3 workgroup names, which are: 'workgroup', 'home' and 'mygroup' all files and printer sharing is enabled. with that 3 workgroup names, i can see and share everything.. (within the shared documents folder, of course..) as for bandwith limiter, you should go with mg advice.. or google it for such utility etc.
