<s> i have a dell dimension 8200 series desktop with 512 mb pc800 rdram memory, pentium 4 processor at 2.0 ghz and windows xp home os. i have a 64 mb nvidia geforce mx graphics card but i have access to a 256 mb one that i could install instead.  </s>
<s> i would like to upgrade this for my grandson to use to play &quot;world of warcraft&quot;.  </s>
<s> would it be worth it to upgrade the memory?  </s>
<s> what about the processer speed?  </s>
<s> i wouldn't need a new mother board, would i? and why would you need a new motherboard, anyway?  </s>
<s> any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks, kathy k.  </s>
<s> rdram is relative expensive ($30 for 256mb) and cpu-wise you'd have to search for a used processor in the 2.2-2.4ghz  </s>
<s> range ($30) and *hope* it works.  </s>
<s> add a decent 256mb agp card ($70) and you've spent $120 (and a lot of effort) or so on a pc that is still way behind the curve and far slower than any new dual-core $400 pc.  </s>
<s> here are the specs for your system: on ram increase you must install in &quot;pair&quot; the rimm type ram.  </s>
<s> this is getting harder to find, but maybe the best bet to help the system along.  </s>
<s> since, you mention you have 512mb installed, more than likely 2x256mb sticks of ram.  </s>
<s> that leaves to 2 more slots to fill, so another 2x256mb will do.  </s>
<s> otherwise, the bad scenario is you have 4x128mb install, meaning 4 sticks of ram, you have to sacrifice at least 1pair to be lost when you install the new ram.  </s>
<s> i'm not there, so you need to figure what you actually have.  </s>
<s> follow the link, but the info/details are provided via the dell support website.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
