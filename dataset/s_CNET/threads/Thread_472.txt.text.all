looking to purchase a new computer. 
i mainly do my gaming on my ps3 but would like something capable of gaming to switch it up once and while. 
want something that doesn't bog down when running multiple applications also. 
any suggestions? 
&quot;doesn't bog down when running multiple applications&quot; i have yet to find such a machine. 
maybe we'll have to wait for the next big change?

we know there is not an affordable machine made that won't tax you in too many ways from electrical use to spending as much as a new home that does not slow down. 
but let's say you want a gaming desktop. the easy path is to go get one. 
look at the video card list at as you can scale up according to your budget. 
as to the host pc i suggest the usual core i7 or 4 to 6 cores and start with the usual 4gb ram and the windows 7 64 bit os. if you don't want to learn how to build this machine, get it ready to use.
