<s> we know there is not an affordable machine made that won't tax you in too many ways from electrical use to spending as much as a new home that does not slow down.  </s>
<s> but let's say you want a gaming desktop. the easy path is to go get one.  </s>
<s> look at the video card list at as you can scale up according to your budget.  </s>
<s> as to the host pc i suggest the usual core i7 or 4 to 6 cores and start with the usual 4gb ram and the windows 7 64 bit os. if you don't want to learn how to build this machine, get it ready to use.  </s>
