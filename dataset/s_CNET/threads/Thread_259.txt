5509	22	253293	2521528	2521453	kentuckyblue	6/22/07 6:40 pm	1.1825376e12	nevermind	i wrote the following before i read this posting. i'm not a newbie. i have actually helped others with their computer problems, and helped keep a computer system at my work running and i thought someone here could do the same for me. i had gotten so much help over the years from the folks at zdnet that i often wished i could be of that kind of help. i came here earlier today asking what was the best way to make a copy of my hard drive, both files and software. (see my initial posting for more information.) my cd drives don't work and the folks at dell, both warranty hardware technical advisers and fee-based software technical advisers, said there must be a corrupt windows file and the best option was to format my hard drive, reinstall my operating system and copy my applications and files back to the hard drive. when i first started working with them, they both promised me this would not be necessary, but later determined they had been wrong. they came to this conclusion by my allowing them to use dell connect and roam around in my computer. at least one of them ran regedit, because i sat here and watched them do it and work with registry files. i tried to explain this here, but i was told i was being lazy, was not asking the correct question, was ignoring hints and was asking someone to do my work for me. when i asked: ``i'm new to these fora although i used the zdnet communities many times, so : what is an interview? what is a usb hard disk what is acronis? and how do you mean for me to use pc relocator?'' at that point, mr. proffitt wrote: ``i decline to answer easy&quot;s (sic). no one ever answered those questions, and i'd still like to know i recognize there are differences of opinion about how my cd drives can be made to work, but i had decided to follow the suggestions from dell and hoped someone here could advise me about the best way to save the contents of my hard drive. i already have replaced the two cd drives with two new ones and they don't work, either. i had decided on a solution. i wanted to know how best to do it. i was not trying to get someone to help me fix the drives, as badly as mr. proffitt wanted me to ask him how to do it. my initial plan was to purchase a scsi drive, install windows on it and then use pc relocator to copy my hard drive contents, but i wasn't sure how to do it and came here for that advice. i realize asking a question put me open to his comments, but rather than help me, i was insulted, misled and threatened with the loss of mr. proffitt's wisdom. i won't seek his or anyone else's help here ever again.

5509	37	253293	2522081	2521589	rossfl	6/23/07 9:55 am	1.1825925e12	i'm surprised	no one else has jumped in here. i'm not a &quot;newbie&quot; but have backed up my hard-drive, tho not the cheapest way. i have no idea how to use that back up if i ever need to. i bought a 250gb maxtor external hard drive and followed the directions that came with the software. i am , again, mystified by the instructions for recovery, since it refers to things that i do not have and cannot find, like a &quot;windows recovery cd&quot; and leaves me entirely on my own for getting one. computers these days don't come with them and making one is not always as easy as the geeks think it is for the average consumer. it's like a car manufacturer telling you that if you can't get your car started, don't call us, you bought it, you figure out how to fix it. any other business would go broke if they just gave you an unassembled product and expected you to figure it out for yourself. and do not tell me the instructions are complete, because they are always filled with jargon and half-answers, or refer to stuff that may have been in someone else's computer but is not in yours. frankly, i've always been impressed with bob's help in the past but am mystified at his approach to this lady's problem, as it seems very obtuse and not at all helpful. i've had a similar problem with both nero and sonic and did find a notice that the nero i had had an incompatibility problem with windows!!!! windows and nero were working on it, but i figured that if they released a program that won't work with windows, what in the world were they thinking and why would anyone bother to buy it? it came with my computer, so i got rid of it. i know little or nothing about computers but i keep trying to learn and it just gets harder and harder because those who do know want to keep it a secret, probably since they worked so hard to find out for themselves. btw (that means by the way, which took me an eternity to figure out, since computer geeks do not use the long-established convention of using a term, like &quot;by the way&quot; the first time it is used in a document and then following it with the initials in parenthesis, like &quot;by the way [btw],&quot; to let you know they intend to just use the initials from now on), a usb, flash-drive or 'thumb-drive' may be the best way to copy your files to save them. ask for it at the computer counter at your favorite computer store and have the twelve-year-old who sells it to you show you how to use it. all the best. frank

(23:35 here). why defrag? and how to make a new partition on the drive? not a standard xp function. anyway, it's always a bad idea to mess around with partitions on a drive without having a backup of everything that's on it. so that's a catch-22. better wait for the external drive, imo, if you've given up on a repair and want to do a clean install of windows xp. kees

5509	73	253293	2523130	2523067	kentuckyblue	6/24/07 2:55 pm	1.1826969e12	one more time	there are apps on this hard drive that are there only because they were copied from my previous computer using pc relocator and i'd like to know what is the method of reinstalling win xp that is least likely to lose those programs. i just want that to be part of our decision making. you all have been great and i trust your opinions. i have no other concerns except the ultimate $$$ cost of the external drive. i mean, i can buy a new computer for $400, not that i want one that would cost that much. just wondering? thanks, ann
5509	74	253293	2523172	2523135	kentuckyblue	6/24/07 3:40 pm	1.1826996e12	no repair	this is not ``i told you so,'' but i think we've decided there is no repair. two guys here added to the two at dell were sure this problem could be solved without a clean install of windows. it took a while, but each guy thought there was a cure and i did what they told me to do, and in the end, they came to the conclusion that there is no repair, no cure and so we need to get on with it. i just finished a defrag that took less than an hour. i want to get on with the answer i had when i came here and that was what is the best, cheapest way to do a clean install while saving as much software as possible. with some kind of external hard drive, i can save all of the files that need saving, so the question remains. i hope that's what happens next, maybe tomorrow. thanks to everyone who tried to cure the problem. ann

5509	78	253293	2523256	2523243	rsternb	6/24/07 6:07 pm	1.18270842e12	okydoky	you also might want to get pqmagic - it can make partitions and is fairly easy to do. i have had it for many years so dont know if it can be had as download from cnet. another - regseeker. it is a free download from cnet and i use it regularly. this is its specific name - not to be confused with regrepair or any of the others that cnet has that will allow download and run but only find the problems and not fix any till u pay up. plus - ccleaner - this is a fast pgm that will get rid of spy cookies and will partially clean the register. a free download. i have never used pc relocator so i dont know what its capabilities are - actually - never heard of it either hahahaha guess i will have to check it out. the biggest question (just thought of this) what type of hard drive does your motherboard support. ? ? standard ide or is it sata capable?? you will need to know that when u order an internal drive. the difference is visable by what type cabel is connected to it. ide has a flat wide cable about 2 inches wide and the sata has a smaller cable about a half inch wide. lastly - on the start/all programs/accessories/ menu - down near the bottom is 'windows explorer' right click and create a shorcut - then drag the shortcut to your desktop. we will use it a lot when we get going again. cant think of anything else right now. hahaha that - - gets harder every year these days hahaha ted
5509	79	253293	2523274	2523256	kentuckyblue	6/24/07 6:43 pm	1.18271058e12	the first thing i noticed	when i opened this computer when it arrived and was planning to put the other drive in, it was obvious the cable was different. it looked like a double ac cord and it is medium blue. it doesn't look like any wiring i've ever seen in a computer, but it was obvious that it was not like the cables in my old computer. pc relocator is wonderful. it is a cd that is installed on both computers and comes with a connector that is plugged into both computers. this computer already had windows installed so i just went thru the list of applications and files i wanted copied on to the new computer from the old and it worked like a dream. i figured the process would take hours, so i left my office here at home, had lunch with friends and came back expecting to have to sit here for hours, but when i got back it was finished. i was hoping for a solution to the clean install that would allow me to do the same thing, i.e., install windows on a 2nd drive, copy the apps i wanted to keep to it, format the hard drive and do a reverse copy. i guess i was hoping for too much. talk to you soon, ann

(they are the newspaper articles i've written in wordperfect over the last 10 years and i use them to flesh out a story with background and history.) and, would it be best once all the software, the os and files to make the 160 my master drive and the 120 the backup?? thanks. i realize you may not be here for a while. it's 11:30 a.m. here in the oldest settlement in kentucky, harrodsburg. ann

5509	89	253293	2529144	2528967	rsternb	7/1/07 2:00 pm	1.1832984e12	im not going anywhere	partitions are similar to folders - except (remember the file cabinet drawers) they are truly separate. you can format a partition and it does not have an effect on any other partition. except - when u format the c:drive - all the shortcuts on your desktop go too. so, you have to run each setup in the other partitions to reset shortcuts and reference points that some things have to have on c:. some of the simpler programs only need to have the shortcut re done, or copied to the desktop. to create a partition you just need to know how many gig's u need to have within a partiton. i suggest 20g for the c: just in case you ever decide to go to vista. it needs a lot of room. i will be many years probably b4 i switch. even if you only do 2 partitions - c: ,, and leave the rest open so its just like u now have, but data is more protected from changes to the c:. xp install to a new blank drive will ask u if u want to partition the drive and you can tell it yes and enter 20g....simple simon.....said the pieman... of which i make a mean lemon merangue and apple. lol give it all the thought u need. like the saying goes - measure twice cut once. lol ted
5509	90	253293	2529522	2529144	kentuckyblue	7/2/07 5:54 am	1.18335564e12	i hate to continue to seem such a dummy, but .....	my crushing deadline has been put off, so i may try to install the 160 sooner than next weekend, if i get a rush of bravery that overtakes my insecurity about moving files and apps. if i install winxp in the c drive and all of my apps and files in the next partition, how do i use winxp in the second partition? i mean, if i install wordperfect on the 2nd partition -- let's call it d -- and go to wp, how does it connect -- or work with -- the c partition? i think i've answered my own question. it is the operating system for the whole computer, which raises another question: do i install xp on the backup drive which is now serving as my primary or does xp take care of that, too? 3 other questions: 1. when i boot the beast, does it automatically go the c drive and how, short of going to dos, do i get to the d drive, or does it show up in my computer? and speaking of the desktop, can i put shortcuts to the various drives and partitions on the desktop?? the second question is more complicated. 2. my first computer was built by two friends and the guy that installed all of the software set it up so that every wp file also was copied to a 3.5 floppy -- remember those? -- so i'd always have a backup copy. if i reinstall my current drive, can i set up the computer so that wp will write to that drive? i have always kept my created wp files (newspaper articles, questions and notes) in a separate folder called wptext so i don't have my written files all jumbled up in the app's files, another suggestion from my software friend. 3. how do i tell the computer which is the master and which is the slave? thanks again, ann

(note the statement, &quot;. . . hopefully save you many many hours.&quot;) i'm disappointed a moderator would use such antics as to avoid excessive posts while in the process create more strife (and, coincidentally, more posts) and wasting &quot;many many hours.&quot; anyways, in post 46, you stated, &quot;i want to make a complete backup, hopefully without the corrupt file that is causing the problem.&quot; this is close to where we want to be; however, i see two (2) fallacies in this statement. 1) a &quot;complete backup&quot; (aka image, among other names) literally copies everything in the computer/software, down to the error that prompted the backup (in your case at least). furthermore (and this has been mentioned a number of times), creating an image of your computer and then transferring that image to a new hdd, in an attempt to salvage programs of which you no longer own any installation media, will only yield the same issues you are experiencing now. 2) it may not be a &quot;corrupt file.&quot; as we do not know the culprit of your situation, it could be, in fact, an issue in the registry (as the &quot;try this&quot; article attempts to examine and correct through the steps). also, throughout the thread, you had a number of questions, a couple of which have not been answered. as to what a usb drive is, that was answered in post 45. if you have any more questions about that, we can address this further. just keep in mind that a &quot;usb drive&quot; has many different names. . . . as to what an &quot;interview&quot; is, that was something r. proffitt mentioned and never explained. personally, i think he simply meant exactly what it is: an interview. asking you technical questions and receiving technical answers. if you ask me, that comment was a bit inane for this thread as he was obviously frustrated for whatever reason and was simply trying to ridicule you and try to make you look stupid and foolish because he wasn't getting the answers he wanted, even though this was a thread about you (namely: not him). also, no one ever explained what acronis is. it's simply a backup software. search for it on download.com and you'll find it has a &quot;free to use; buy for $xx&quot; liscense. personally, i stick to freeware apps and only buy hardware. i was also thinking . . . if you bought an internal hdd, are you still planning to do a &quot;double switch&quot;? you would be better off installing the newer hdd as your permanent primary hdd and using that once you get everything onto it instead of doing the work twice over. . . . do you follow or have i misinterpreted your plans? i hope this post answered all of your questions you had throughout the thread and addressed viable concerns. ~wakedaddy

5509	99	253293	2538737	2538392	rsternb	7/13/07 8:52 am	1.18431672e12	morning - uph now= sort of	follow post 92 - simple stuff - actually u shoud b there by now if u started early am your time lol hmmm need coffee.... ted
