hello i installed a slave drive for backup,but when i restart my computer it does not show up in my computer every time. sometimes it shows up but not always. i'm afraid to put anything important on here in case i can't access it when i need it. the bios has it listed there as a slave drive. i went into disk management and formatted it and assigned it a drive letter,but the next time i turned on my computer it was gone. i am running xp home on a desktop emachines t6216, which is 1 year old. thanks in advance of any help you can give me. wendy
sounds like u have some bad disks in that drive. formatting it should fix a corrupted drive. if you have warranty still, try to get it replaced or something.
did you check the cable?
i have had the drive checked for bad sectors and get an ok reading.it is a good drive.
yes cable is in and is tight.
