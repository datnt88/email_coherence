<s> all re-arrange under varying install site, conditions, your choice of settings, firmware versions and if we include support the winner changes daily.  </s>
<s> all those you listed are names i've installed in the last decade excep for aruba.  </s>
<s> so i'll arrange all but aruba as number one and put aruba as item 2. hope this helps.  </s>

<s> thanks for ur replay ... i just ask about ranking products from best to worst accordng to the quality, the performance , the brand name and the reputation of the ap ... so can u help me ???  </s>
<s> all are fine devices and companies and the winner will change depending on site, install location, settings and which tech support person you call.  </s>
<s> aruba is not a name i've encountered in decades of setting up networks.  </s>
<s> so that's the problem.  </s>
<s> if you haven't been doing this for long you may think there is a good to best ranking.  </s>
<s> the truth is deeper than that.  </s>
