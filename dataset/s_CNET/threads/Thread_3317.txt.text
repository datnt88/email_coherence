hi there ive a dimension pc from dell. however ive no sound and in dm im getting a exclamation mark next to ethernet controller and multimedia controller ive installed a new graphics card disabled the onboard but no sound any ideas please noel
about the drivers you installed for sound. i can't do that for you as you didn't tell the model number. but you can find your drivers at dell.com with your service tag. bob
please tell us the model no. of your computer .
i just deleted one your other posts. please don't add links to the home page of another helpsite or blog like i-yogi. links to other sites are ok if they go directly to a page that applies to the particular problem in the thread. kees
what i'm using is not under discussion yet. bob
