can the circuit board from a model 90845d4 be used in a model 86480d6? thanks in advance...
board swaps only worked for me when all numbers matched including firmware versions on the boards. but faced with total loss why not try?
yes, board swaps only worked when all numbers matched including firmware versions. this is not a good choice for recovering files. you'd better try some software first, for example, data recovery wizard, which is powerful and valuable.
they have spammed the forums so that's not good.
