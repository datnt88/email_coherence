my internal dual-format dvd rewritable drive recently stopped recognizing disks. whether i try to read or write. it worked faily well until i installed new firmware. i would like to uninstall the firmware but can't figure out how. i tried system restore but none of the restore dates would work. the device manager says that it is working properly. but whenever i put a disk into it, it prompts me to insert a disk. any suggestions??
to change firmware, you simply program the unit with the version of firmware you want to go to. bob
xp has a driver roll back function. open control panel, system, hardware tab, device manager. click cd/dvd drives, highlight the drive in question, right click, click properties. click the driver tab, select rollback driver. good luck, telephony facts, analog/digital explained. see the cnet faces behind the posts. i think computer viruses should count as life. i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. we've created life in our own image. - - stephen w. hawking
i tried to get new firmware but couldn't find it for my burner. i'll keep looking.
my operating system is xp. i tried to roll back but there is nothing to roll back to. thanks for the advice anyhow.
