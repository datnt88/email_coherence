hello everyone, i am currently having problems with a dell desktop computer. the montitor will not come on and the light in the front of the monitor keeps flashing green. i checked all the cables in the back and everything is connected correctly. the weird thing is i didn't do anything to this computer, it just happened when i turned it on today. plz help
i don't know much cause you did not give me enough information. i will assume that your computer is new chances are the monitor could just be bad. another way to find out if its your monitor is to hook to another computer and see how the monitor works if the monitor works then then it is in your computer. perhaps unplug the monitor from the wall and let set for 10 minutes that will allow it to reset. then try it still don't work then get another monitor
go wal-mart or sams club
