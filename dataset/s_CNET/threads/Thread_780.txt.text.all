<s> i just went to load up a cd when my cd/dvd player didnt reconize it.  </s>
<s> i then tried a few other disk still nothing.  </s>
<s> im wondering if it has somthing to do with me recently formatting my computer.  </s>
<s> i checked the dirvers and they seem to be fine.  </s>
<s> anyone have a clu what the problem is?  </s>
<s> if so reply and ill aprreciate it.  </s>
<s> thanks all  </s>
<s> on the microsoft operating system cd are so few drivers for motherboards and more that anyone that installs windows learns after awhile to install all the current drivers for everything.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> already installed latest drivers but still isnt working.  </s>
<s> in some systems if we forget to install drivers that does happen.  </s>
<s> also if we install nero, roxio and such can cause the drive to vanish (this was not mentioned so it's not that.) bob  </s>
<s> to make sure i did this right i went in to device manger right cliked on my cd/dvd drive and went to teh driver section and clicked on teh update driver button.  </s>
<s> if there a different way please let me know.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> since all versions of windows have a cd driver that fails everytime.  </s>
<s> your posts have yet to follow the guideline of the words you see in red with each post.  </s>
<s> i'm left to guess what you've done to install this os. bob  </s>
<s> this is quite normal if we forget drivers or install some cd recording software.  </s>
<s> be sure to heed those words in red so we can fix this.  </s>
