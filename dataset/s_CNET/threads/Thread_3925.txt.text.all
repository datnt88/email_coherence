<s> to save you time, just gift them out on freecycle (see google.)  </s>
<s> this parts is very old the i486 dx2 work with no fan and the computer that that use it don't have mouse or hard disk and it use black and white montior and it made 1989 see how old plus i looked for the old value ones i found there are many processors that have a big value for it is old time and newest than i have so please think again and tell your answer thank you mohamed dergham  </s>
<s> no one is actively marketing these and there are faster, better, more current cpus and more for free on freecycle which as you may know is a &quot;free&quot; way to recycle older or such items.  </s>
<s> you may value these but frankly what you need to find is someone that doesn't know about freecycle as well has a need for these parts plus some cash to give you for them.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> tell us how much is it worth to you.  </s>
