my computer restarts everytime just before the burning starts. what is the problem and what can i do?
since nothing was shared about the pc, your discussion dies.
what shoud i tell about the computer?
the forum asks so responders don't have to ask. the forum asked: &quot;note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.&quot; i will not ask every time since it's up to you to participate in fixing your issue. bob
i use windows xp home edition. i have 2 dvd roms and one harddisk. i dont know what else you need to know. i also get this error message: invalid_work_queue_item one man thougt it was some power problem, but the error message didnt show that.
for instance i see such an error reported with a btc dvd recorder, but you didn't respond to the forum note with make and model of all the parts. this is not tech support. this is a place where we team up on your issue. if you don't want to share then this is very rough. if you don't know what you have, just say so. many learn about belarc advisor so they can help themselves. bob
