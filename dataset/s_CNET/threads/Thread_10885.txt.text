hello. i want to protect this router with wpa encryption key but i want some help to find one suitable key. thank you.
use something you can remember.
wpa has a number of improvements over wep, the most significant being the use of temporal key integrity protocol (tkip), which dynamically changes keys as the system is used. this provides greatly improved protection against, and effectively defeats, the well-known key recovery attacks on wep. your question suggests you will be using personal wpa, which utilizes pre-shared key (psk) mode. this is where every allowed computer is given the same passphrase. in psk mode, security depends on the strength and secrecy of the passphrase. the passphrase may be from 8 to 63 printable ascii characters or 64 hexadecimal digits (256 bits). however, the weak passphrases that users typically employ are vulnerable to password cracking attacks. to protect against a brute force attack, a truly random passphrase of at least 20 characters should be used, and 33 characters or more is recommended. in summary the more random your wpa preshared key, the safer it is to use. telindus technical support uk
