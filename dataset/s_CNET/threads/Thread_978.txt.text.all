<s> if you're looking for a all-in-one tv tuner solution.  </s>
<s> they'll be able to provide you tech support if you need it.  </s>
<s> if you're going to use seperate tv/media software such as beyondtv, the prolink pixelview is an ok choice.  </s>
<s> check you media software's compatibility list and use it to decide.  </s>
<s> i'm not familiar with the intex, but from their website i'd steer clear of them since they appear to be a small manufacturer that's apt to drop a product line at any time.  </s>
