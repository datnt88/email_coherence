i didnt know where to go to ask this question on your site but....i have 2 sata harddrives install on my computer.....everything recognizes it in the bios except for the assigning drive letter section....and even when i use programs like &quot;dell datasafe backup&quot; it shows its exsistence, but.. under my computer it only shows my original drive not my newly added hd? is there anyway i can fix this? 
im completely stumped. 
most drives are blank and we get to prepare them for use in the os of choice. 
i would be guessing this is some windows version so let's guess it's windows 7 and here's an article. 
i am running windows 7...my new drive is blank of course....and i already have a 500gig harddrive in my new pc that came with it...im just wanting to add a second hard drive to my pc and the new hd is a 1tb 
check under windows....disk management. 
new hard disks need to be partitioned and formatted before being recognized or visible under 'my computer'. 
let us know.
