<s> i am trying to find a way to stream live video feed to nursery about 300 ft away from recording room in my church.  </s>
<s> i have sony camcorder hc-96 with mike-input and will try to stream on dell xps m1210(2duo, 2ghz) laptop.  </s>
<s> i have vista on laptop at the moment, which i really hate cause it's so different from xp. i might reformat to xp. anyway, i heard i need to get real producer or microsoft encorder to stream live video feed.  </s>
<s> any recommendation which to use?  </s>
<s> i do not want to put out on internet, but use for internal network.  </s>
<s> our church does not have fund for external internet viewing.  </s>
<s> presently, we plan to have one view, but thinking about more viewers in future.  </s>
<s> for network, i have netgear 614(54mbps), which is what i already have, and plan to have repeater for better signal for nursury since the nursery is 300+ ft away; hawking technology - 802.11g wireless-g range extender or linksys wireless-g range expander wre54g - repeater.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure which is better/better signal/better range.  </s>
<s> any recommendation on that?  </s>
<s> currently we don't have homepage, but we do have high speed cable(5mbs) i think.  </s>
<s> i am looking into have home with live stream or stream video availability, but that's in way future.  </s>
<s> what i don't really know is how to get all this together and viewer see sermon in nursery 300+ft away?  </s>
<s> nursery will have tv hooked up to toshiba laptop with wireless(xp, p4, 2.3ghz) can someone help me with final stage please.  </s>

<s> first a little background.  </s>
<s> i've worked for a company that designed, sold and repaired those school bus cameras.  </s>
<s> they did have a camcorder (sony too!) and we had to use a camcorder modified by sony for a small issue. the camcorder auto shuts off after some number of minutes.  </s>
<s> this is why your project should not involve this camcorder.  </s>
<s> those wifi cams you see might work if your wifi access point is someplace closer.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i would be live stream for maybe 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours top. the nursery might be 300+ ft away from recording room, but i would be getting network repeater like linkus, so i would have network signal.  </s>
<s> many who tried to use such as webcams re-learned this.  </s>
<s> i offer this so you don't have to rediscover this issue.  </s>
<s> since you have the camcorder, try it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i don't have to have homepage to stream live video, right?  </s>
<s> can i setup the stream in shared folder so i can see the streamed video?  </s>
<s> i'm planning to do this project this thursday, so i need all the help i could get.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> i understand bob, what you're trying to say.  </s>
<s> forgive my stubornness in this.  </s>
<s> i like to see through this whether i can do this or not.  </s>
<s> chong  </s>
<s> didn't help me understand this.  </s>
<s> best of luck in your tests.  </s>
<s> i hope i saved you some time.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i bought the hawking range extender recently and tested previous weeks.  </s>
<s> for some reason, my laptop is either lagging too much as the video is stopping every few second or there are too much interfearances that my laptop is not picking up standard definition video with 1200k bit rate.  </s>
<s> i am going to test this with other more powerful laptop or desktop.  </s>
