(i wasn't sure if the two 160 satas are set up as master-slave, or both considered part of the same master hd.) would the win 98se os on the old drive try to kick in automatically for some reason before i could erase it? or, on the other hand, would there be any reason to leave win 98se on the drive (eg to run the old programs, like some games that don't work on xp)? i don't have a discwizard diskette to go with the old drive for partitioning and formatting, so is that a problem? or will the winxp system automatically detect the old hd, or be able to use one of the cds that came with the dell to detect the old hd?
