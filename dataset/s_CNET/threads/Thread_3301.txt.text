running xp home sp2. currently have an nvidia geforce2 mx 64 meg video card in the agp slot. going to replace it with a geforce fx5500 256mb ddr agp card. what's the best/correct process to replace it? the nvidia drivers are listed in add/remove. can i swap the cards, power up and run the new drivers install cd? or should i uninstall the old ones first. tlia, wayne
i don't uninstall anything. i download the latest drivers then pop in the new card and install the latest drivers. never had an issue with that. bob ps. be sure to update directx later.
just install the new drivers over the old ones? i'm running dx 9.0c, looks like 10 is out. i'll get it now.
looks like 10 is for vista. won't be getting that.
some are neatniks. i don't want to spend the time at that and for me its working fine. i think some noted a &quot;driver cleaner.&quot; bob
