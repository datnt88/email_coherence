using 3 hp computers - one desktop pc and two laptops. trying to share one printer, an hp psc 1350v all in one. using a netgear ps121 mini-print server and all the computers are also hooked into a netgear fvs318 vpn. all the computers can send things to the printer with no problem, but need to have bi-directional capability for scans. any suggestions?
is one you probably won't like - get a new all-in-one designed with network capability built-in (prices start at $500). the older all-in-one devices lose both the &quot;all&quot; and the &quot;in&quot; and become just &quot;one&quot; (print) when placed on a print server. just the way it works, can't be fixed. dw
you need a printer/scanner that comes with this capabilty. adding it later is painful for those that will not use linux or other type servers... bob
