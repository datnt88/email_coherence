<s> i am thinking of buying a new pc and just wondered if 1080p gaming is now viable without costing a fortune!  </s>
<s> i am not concerned about 60fps, although a steady 30fps would be nice.  </s>
<s> just wondered if i need to go for a top-end core i7, or would an i7 920 be sufficient?  </s>
<s> thx xdantespardax  </s>
<s> oh, and i guess the graphics card should be something like a radeon hd5870, but again could i go lower and still get decent fps?  </s>

<s> that produces enjoyable results.  </s>
<s> basically, spend the $ now will provide a longer period before yet another upgrade.  </s>
<s> also, keep the pc as cool as possible.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
