<s> i am looking for a new computer.  </s>
<s> i have close to $700.00 to spend.  </s>
<s> i have read the specs for sims 3 but for one,i want to make sure it has more than the basics.  </s>
<s> since adding custom content and expansion packs will slow things down. the computer i had fits the specs but if i added a bunch of cc's ( not even a quarter of what i used to have on sims 2 )it would slow way down.  </s>
<s> i dont' want that.  </s>
<s> i want a computer that can handle lots of custom content, since that's half the fun of the sims is adding custom content..and getting more expansion packs.  </s>
<s> secondly, i have no idea of how to covert those things mentioned in the specs into other products.  </s>
<s> there are so many names and brands and numbers of processors and graphics cards, it's just very confusing to know what is equal to what.  </s>
<s> i am currently looking at a computer a gamer suggested to me.  </s>
<s> i was wondering if anyone could tell me if the specs sound good for sims 3..i also want to run &quot;daz&quot; on it..if any of you are familiar with that.it's not a game but a 3d graphics program.. anyways i guess, mainly concentrate on the sims 3 if you dont' know of the other.  </s>
<s> whatever works for sims 3 should work for that as well.  </s>
<s> please let me know if the computer below is good for sims 3 or if you have any other suggestions.  </s>

<s> thanks for your input.  </s>
<s> yeah not crazy bout the warranty..i thought maybe they had some kind of plan that you could buy to extend that warranty but i'm not sure..although i have had long ones before and then my machine would go like a month after the warranty was over..oh well, anyway thanks for your opinion.  </s>
<s> you did not state in your original post the current specs for your computer; depending on your pc skills (and the age of your computer), for $700 you could upgrade the individual components inside it, and get extended warranties on each component (the manufacturer warranties are usually pretty good).  </s>
<s> thanks but i'm not interested in upgrading.  </s>
<s> i have already upgraded once and i really don't want to go through that again...besides the computer's getting pretty old and it's not really up to being upgraded anymore than it already is.  </s>
