hi can someone help please. i downloaded skype but norton is blocking it i presume as i can not connect. can anyone tell me how to put skype in the allowed list. can't figure it out. many thanks.
since your question is to me but doesn't pertain to the current topic and no peripheral is in use, my comment is that you need to post with more care. links only:  &quot;norton internet security graphical step-by-step instructions for con&#64257; guring norton internet security for use with skype are available on skypes website at  . html to con&#64257; gure norton internet security to allow you to use skype:&quot;... the answer is on skype.com can i ask if you looked there? bob
