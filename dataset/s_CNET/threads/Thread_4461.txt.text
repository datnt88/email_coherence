i have toshiba hd part # mk2023gas which also has a hp part # j6054b the drives work fine individually but when i try to connect them as master and slave none of the drives are detected. any suggestions?
use the shiny new 80 conductor cable and set the drives to cable select. master/slave is so 1990's. bob
besides what robert has already stated, understand how your hd is actually configured by the jumpers. cable select should with the newer type 40-pin/80-wire ide cables provide the fix. if not, then the hd jumpers may need an added jumper for solo or dual operation, if applicable. so visit the hd makers website to see how they expect their operation to be set for dual install or check that decal/sticker found on the hd. tada -----willy
