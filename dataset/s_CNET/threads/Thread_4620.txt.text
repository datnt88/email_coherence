i bought a logitech joystick but i cant make it work with any game. im playing line of sight but the software from logitech is asking me for the executible.exe file. i don't know what this is do you guys? i have to set each button to know what is doing right?
- what's your os? - what's the joystick model number? - did the joystick come with a cd, and what did you do with it? - are you sure you followed the exact installation instructions? - what exactly is the error message (full text, without typos like &quot;executible&quot; - i suppose it's a typo) and when does it appear? kees
i saied executible file because thats what it asked for yet its named executive.exe file. no the product didnt come with a cd since windows xp needs no drivers. i downloaded the software from logitech. the product is a logitech joystick attack 3. the software told me to basically connect what game i was going to play to make the game file. i went to the games folder until it stopped at the file where it was ok. this is the produtct here.
