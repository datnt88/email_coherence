i would like up upgrade my computer by replacing the motherboard, cpu, ram and power supply, everything else will stay the same. i am ruuning windows vista home premium. my question is will i have to re-load windows vista? i upgraded to vista from xp and only have the upgrade dvd and not the full version. the price for the hardware is not an issue, but if i have to pay $250 for the full version of vista that then becomes a problem thanks wayne
install xp then vista or install vista and upgrade to vista. both options will work and allow you to continue.. if you have a full copy of windows xp (and not a upgrade version) then your good to go.
thanks mementh: i don't have the full version to either one, they are both upgrades that i installed.
windows will recognize the new hardware and of course run through the wizards to install, but you will likely have to reactivate your copy of windows. i recently moved my xp hardrive from an old machine to a different mainboard, cpu, ram and psu due to a mainboard failure. xp detected a significant change in hardware and made me reactivate. but that only takes a few moments.
its better to reinstall then to use a old install.. the old drivers could cause issues.. and its just better in the long run
vista handles low-level hardware changes much better than xp. avoiding a complete reinstall when changing mobo/drive controllers was one of the goals that it actually met.
thanks for your replies to my question. my son just told me that he and my grandkids are buying me the full version of vista ultimate for christmas and beings i won't be doing the upgrade until after the holidays there is no problem now. thanks again wayne
problem soved
