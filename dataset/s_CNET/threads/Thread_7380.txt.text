i have a new tablet pc running vista business. it has wireless and bluetooth built in. i will be connecting an external monitor to the tablet's video port. i wonder if there is an adapter that i can attach to the cable of the external monitor and then wirelessly display on the external monitor?
the last time i looked into this the hardware was well over 2 grand. the member didn't believe it so i had to let them spin. bob
....i guess i can by a 25 ft vga extension cord to move around more.....
is there a way to set up a bluetooth connection between my desktop pc and a lcd tv. i currently connect them with a dvi to hdmi cable.
there is no software today that can move video realtime over such a link. bob
