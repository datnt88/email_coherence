hi; got a 3-4 yr. old acer aspire 4738z that does the following sporatically: * refreshes web pages * changes default browser * reinstalls windows updates that it's already installed * external keyboard (internal no longer works) suddenly won't type certain keys * opens ms outlook all_the_time (close it, reopens) once (wrote about this earlier) it shut the whole computer down and wouldn't even let me into bios, let alone boot windows. where do i begin trouble-shooting this? tia, john
boot off any live os cd (too many to choose from today) and see if the keyboard works. if not, start with fixing that as stuck keys can do what you noted. bob
occasionally it's the keyboard. but it works fine in another computer, and goes back to working fine in this one as well when i reboot. like i said originally in the first post where i enumerated all sorts of strange problems, that's just one of many. no stuck keys. john
a clean install will clear that up. bob
it sounds as if you have a corrupted system possibly due to virus/malware infestation(s). you said nothing about a/v security software, scans etc. mr. proffitt suggested a reload (windows)..imop likely the easiest way out.
thanks, all! john
