i am looking for a smallish tablet to be used primarily for notetaking during lectures and meetings. 
i am interested in something smaller than an ipad. 
which of the many tablets out there is good for this purpose? 
you can read more of the specifications of tablet pc here: the site have pretty much know all about tablet pc. 
try the htc flyer, at best buy for $299. 
quite good. 
do you mean like a graphics tablet?
