<s> at our office we have two 50in hd tvs that have vga and hdmi.  </s>
<s> we want to stream internet on them but they don't have any network or internet capability.  </s>
<s> i have a pc that has a dual hdmi and dvi video card in it.  </s>
<s> i'm thinking that what i could do is that i could put a dvi-d to hdmi adapter on the dvi port and run two 50 ft hdmi in wall cables to the tvs that way i could extend the pc desktop to the tvs.  </s>
<s> showing two different things on both tvs.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure that is even possible or will work.  </s>
<s> plus how would i do sound for each tv would that be possible.  </s>
<s> anyone that can help me figure out to accomplish this or if this would even work i'd appreciate it!  </s>
<s> if so i have only seen demos of this but never in off the shelf machines.  </s>
<s> i'm going with no and then suggest a solution.  </s>
<s> get a pair of netbooks with hdmi (those 238 buck things at target.com?) and use those.  </s>
<s> or maybe a pair of logitech revues at 99 bucks each and use the web browser on that.  </s>
<s> for the network you would have to reveal how you get the internet without &quot;any network or internet capability.&quot;  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you need an internet connection!  </s>
<s> some motherboards have dvi and rgb and sometime even hdmi connections all in one box.  </s>
<s> my main pc has dvi and rgb, so i use both going to different monitors.  </s>
<s> i see no difference in quality (16801x1050).  </s>
<s> on my media pc, i have onle a pci output, which i run to a small wxga monitor, and use a usb video adapter visiontek() for the tv (at 1080p).  </s>
<s> i have a 5.1 audio card in the box which i use for dvd playback, but you can use a 2 or 2.1 system if you are going to stream internet, because i don't know of any (please tell me if there are) dolby-encoded internet video sources.  </s>
<s> i'm almost sure if you get a 1080p capable video card (or mobo) with two outputs, you should be able to do it like that (be sure to ask or try it out).  </s>
<s> otherwise, check out a usb video box, they're pretty reasonable.  </s>
<s> even a single netbook or laptop might be fit for the job, if it has rgb and hdmi, with sufficient resolution.  </s>
