<s> purchased the samsung 244t recently and hooked it up two nights ago to my new rig. it was running fine for about 90 minutes and then all of a sudden the video became very distorted like the pixels were mass merging together.  </s>
<s> nothing was readable and the only thing viewable was color patterns.  </s>
<s> it was almost as if you had an old television and would smack the side of it if the picture started going crazy.  </s>
<s> i am trying to figure out though if it is a possible driver or overheat issue because its defective.  </s>
<s> i do know that it isn't the video card because i have different monitor hooked up and working fine.  </s>
<s> i am currently using an nvidia 8800 with dvi.  </s>
<s> i was reading somewhere though there might be a incompatibility issue between some 3rd party software that comes with the monitor and the video card but never seen it do what i am witnessing at the moment.  </s>

<s> i contacted samsung which was a very pleasent experiance.  </s>
<s> they have you go through some checks (video card, dvi cable, etc) before they process your order.  </s>
<s> they will either ship you a new monitor w/ stand straight to your house (placing a deposit on your credit card) or you can have them send it to an ups store for replacement, which i did. the new monitor came within 5 days and has been working very well since arriving.  </s>
<s> hope all goes well for you but make sure you give them a call.  </s>
<s> thanks for your reply.  </s>
<s> i tried the monitor with another pc and same result.  </s>
