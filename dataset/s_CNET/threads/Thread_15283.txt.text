hey guy, i need some some advices, pls. which should i chose? asus me301t or nexus 7 (3g) ? thanks.
also, what tablet do you use today? at the office we have those nexus 7's and they seem very nice. bob
i originally purchased the nexus 7 and loved every thing about it. my wife loved it so much, well, she took it from me. i then purchased the me301 in place of another nexus and prefer the me301 for a few reasons. the number 1 reason was it's memory expansion capabilities, the second reason was the rear camera. crazy as it sounds, you don't expect to take pictures with a tablet, but it's a good feature to have when the need arises. i will admit, i like the comfort of the nexus 7 better, however the new me301, is pretty comfortable for it's size. last comment, i use the device for personal and business. the me301 is a better choice when sharing information with friends and or customers. oh wait, one more note- both these purchases were my first (i mean second) asus purchase - and i am really impressed with the power and capabilities they packed in a low cost device (s). hope this helps you make a decision.
if you're going that far, why not find a t 300?
