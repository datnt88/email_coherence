i replaced a lynksys router with belkin n+ router. i am having internet connection issues. i worked with belkin support. they updated the firmware, changed channel but the wireless internet speed is 20% of the cable modem speed. i have 2 laptops with windows xp. i also would like to connect my 1tb portable drive to the usb port. please suggest the settings for this router. i will be so greatful.
did you also replace all your interface cards in your pc's. you will not run n unless all your equipment is n. the n routers are designed to run n best. they will run g and b also but that does not mean they do as good a job as router designed for those. one of the main differences is the antenna layout. first plug directly into the router with a lan cable and see if it runs faster. you can also place your pc as close as possible to your router running on the wireless and see if it runs faster.
thanks for this insight. i thought, it might have something to do with &quot;n&quot; but not enough to know that my interface cards need to support &quot;n&quot;. i have not changed any interface cards on the computers and do not plan to. so, i will be getting the &quot;g&quot; router. any suggestions one better than other. i have ordered the linksys (as i used to have that). if there is another suggestion, please advise. thanks..
wireless n has no advantages over g in that regard. in fact, wireless b is faster than most broadband other than those advertised as &quot;turbo&quot; and such. wireless g is already 8x or faster than average broadband. the only advantage that n would provide over g would be within your local area network.
