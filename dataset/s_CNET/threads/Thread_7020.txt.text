i have a nforce 570 slit-a motherboard. i have a single hard drive (250gb) that i have plugged into the sata1 connector. i have 2 ide channels (one primary and one secondary). i currently have my dvd rw drive plugged into the secondard ide channel. is that correct? i was reading on a post that i need to buy an ide card for the dvd but i don't see the sense in that if i have 2 ide's available. thank you for your thoughts. tim
get a nice 80 conductor ide cable and from the primary ide to the master connector on the cable with the drive set to cs plug it in there. bob
bob, is sata supposed to be faster than ide? also, would it improve performance by moving the dvd drive to the primary master ide? thanks again for your thoughts. tim
and to get the best effect i would use both channels. -&gt; yes sata can be faster but most dvd drives have read limits well below the sata speeds and even ide rates. let me comment that for xp, installing to a sata drive (xp retail versions) can be troublesome for some. if i wanted to make it harder to install i'd give my tech all sata components. this changes in vista but that's another can of worms. bob
