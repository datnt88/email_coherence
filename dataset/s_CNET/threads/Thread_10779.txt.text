i bought an ati radeon 9600 pro recently. i have tried to install it, but i cannot install anything from the installation cd. every time i do, the screen goes to energy saving mode, and my tower freezes up. i have installed it in an e-machines t-3302 with an amd sempron processor. it runs at 2ghz.i have 512 mb ram installed. the card is installed in the agp slot. is there anything that i am missing?
if so, did you turn it off in the bios? or, if you had a previous card, did you remove it in device manager, and uninstall any software associated with it? assuming you did these, here's another thing. some hardware drivers do that. when you put in the disc, don't let it &quot;auto-run&quot;. open it manually and install from there. that's happened to me more than once. may take more than one try to get it right. good luck. chuck
my computer currently uses an integrated video setup with s3tray plus. i have disabled it, but the same problem occurred. how do i safely delete this program? what setting would this be under in bios? i am new to computing, and am trying to learn.
