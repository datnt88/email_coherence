my usb flash drive no longer activate when inserted into my laptop's usb port, and any other pc's usb port and it was before. what are the likely causes and is there a solution?
if you mean &quot;doesn't show in my computer and windows explorer&quot;, there are 2 possibilities: 1. see if it comes up in disk management. that means the fileystem is damaged somehow. delete the partition(s) on the drive, make a new one and format it. 2. if it doesn't even show in disk management on several machines it's broken. throw it away then. kees
usually a crack in some circuit path or a burnt out chip. i bet you don't care to discuss causes and just want your memory stick repaired?
why throw it away when you may be able to recover the drive? according to this article -  - it may be possible to fix your problem as long as the drive is still lighting up when you plug it in. give it a shot, may work, just be sure to follow the instructions well cause it warns running both programs at once can cause damage, so be careful!
