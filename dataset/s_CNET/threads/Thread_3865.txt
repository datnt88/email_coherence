(i have a compaq v6000 laptop running xp pro). in my household, there are two other laptops that can print wirelessly just fine. they both have xp home ( i am unsure whether they have sp3 yet) lexmark tech support is stumped at the moment. i can't recall exactly when i upgraded to sp3. is there a log by which i can find out when that was installed on my computer? beyond that, does anybody have any other theories? thanks

8074	3	315941	2906522	2906490	tech agent	11/13/08 5:20 pm	1.2265968e12	issue	no sp 3 does work with lexmark printers, i was stating that that would not be the cause of your issue. an sr number is something that the agent would give you at the end of your call so if you call back it can be looked at. i was wondering what troubleshooting they have done. the printer you have is one of lexmarks newest printers. have you tried updating the firmware which is located below. ftp://ftp.lexmark.com/driver/inkjet_drivers/4900/firmware/4900seriesfirmwareupdate.exe
