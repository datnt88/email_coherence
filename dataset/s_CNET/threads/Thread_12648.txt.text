i have installed windows (xp, vista, and 7 beta) on a new hard drive, all the necessary drivers, but it doesn't work. it works in ubuntu however. it won't work on any install, even on a &quot;new&quot; hard drive (writing 0's to disk). it is not a hardware issue, since it works with a different os. i've tried many ethernet cables and cards to verify this as well. what could be the problem? the diagnose and fix feature doesn't help at all. many thanks for your help.
micrsoft is hit and mostly miss. i don't see where you installed the drivers.
i installed the drivers from the cd that was included with the ethernet card. i also installed the motherboard drivers from the cd and internet, but onboard lan doesn't work either.
i read your posts again and no make, model, driver versions, names. since these are mia you are left with a simple issue and that is, as supplied the product is defective. bob ps. you rarely see people ask for those details since we have the words in red. please tell all the details if you want people to check your work.
