<s> i have a hp computer and lately i've been having trouble getting the computer to come on.  </s>
<s> i've checked the outlet and made sure all the connections were tight. the green light on the monitor is on so i know it's receiving power but nothing happens when i try to turn it on.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> even without the make/model/year i can offer the generic advice.  </s>
<s> 1. the fans come on.  </s>
<s> power off, remove the case and reseat all the cards and cables.  </s>
<s> try again.  </s>
<s> 2. the fans don't come on.  </s>
<s> depending on your expertise, downsize the machine all the way to just motherboard and power supply.  </s>
<s> if no power up (the monitor is not an indication here), then you are looking at the 2 possible bad parts.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thank you for the advice.  </s>
<s> i'll give it a try.  </s>
<s> i was afraid i might have gotten a virus. the hewlett packard model is about 3 years old with windows xp operating system.  </s>
