i have an asus motherboard, m2n-vm dvi. the processor went bad, an athlon 64 x2 4600+. i also have an asus m4a785-m, and a msi 785gtm-e45. my point and question is this.....what is the difference between an am3 socket mb and an am2/am2+ mb and a mb that will use all 3? because i need to replace the processor on my asus m2n-vm dvi which is a socket am2/am2+.my other 2 motherboards will use all 3 socket type processors. i just want to get the best processor the board will use. any help is greatly appreciated.
i've learned to defer to the cpu support lists. i see a lot of options at  bob
use either 785 board, then you can use any amd processor that you happen to have. of course am3 preferred.
