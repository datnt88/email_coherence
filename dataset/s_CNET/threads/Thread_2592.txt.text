i have two pc's xp home(guest) and pro(host){on switch), the home can see pro pc, but the pro can see home but when click its icon get this msg (and cant ping it als0)... is not accessible. you might not have permission to use this network resource. contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. what do you think? ta m
you have to enable file and print sharing through the exceptions tab of windows firewall. then set some folder to be shared and shut off any other firewalls that are running.
control for the exceptions tab of windows firewall? i am able to see my primary pc from other computers on my network but am not allowed access although this primary can access any other pc on the network without issue.
found it in the properties of the connection. thanks
