i am using windows xp sp2 os & right now i am using dial up internet connection with internal modem 56.6kbps speed for internet browsing.my problem is i am getting connected with inetnet but can't able to see any web page & getting a message &quot;page can not be displayed,server can't be found&quot; for any sit.
they get calls like this daily. if you do suspect the hardware then modems die often enough that the tech carries a spare to test with. some will want tech to fix the old modem by reinstalling the os, other means but at 120 bucks an hour the new modem seems the cheap exit. bob
thanks for reply i have checked modem on another sysytem & found that it is working fine. any other thing that i can do plz.help
this forum is about hardware. your post has so little information that i can only offer vague fixes like reinstall the drivers, the os, etc. remember this is all volunteer so you get to apply yourself to make great posts with all the needed details. but as far as the hardware goes the only issue that i noted is done. bob
did this just start happeing? did anything change (new modem?) have you been the modem's manufacture website and see what they have to offer? what sites are you trying to go to ? yahoo.com google.com cnet.com? if the page doesn't come up can you ping it. you have to go to a dos prompt and type ping yahoo.com sense if a response is sent back.
