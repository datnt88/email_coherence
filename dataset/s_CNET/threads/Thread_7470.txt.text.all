<s> i have a dell dimension 4100 with a 20gb ata/100 hard drive.  </s>
<s> i can get a good deal on a 160gb ultra dma/100 hd. will i have any problems adding the 160gb drive to my existing syatem?  </s>
<s> i know very little about this area (no kidding right!).  </s>
<s> i'll write you will have some fun in this one.  </s>
<s> only recent oses support over 137gb and only then with the help of either an updated bios or a pci card that you hope comes with the hard disk. the drive will come with instructions on how to install it for the os in questions.  </s>

<s> i upgraded the os to xp, but have doen nothing withthe bios or pci card.  </s>
<s> i will check with the &quot;friendly&quot; sales people and see if it comes with the card.  </s>
<s> thanks for the reply, and i have no idea why this posted 3 times, i only hit submit once!  </s>

<s> 1. sp1 is needed to support over 137gb drives.  </s>
<s> 2. if you have such a drive and reinstall xp and xp doesn't have sp1 built-in, then the over 137gb drive contents vanish.  </s>
<s> fix for item number 2 is to get or make an xp cd with sp1 integrated.  </s>
<s> if this is a dell, then ask for an updated os cd so you don't lose it all.  </s>
