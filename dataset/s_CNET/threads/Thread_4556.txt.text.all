hello i have an hp pavilion ze 4200 labtop with 2 sticks of 256mb ram and i wanted to upgrade to two 1gb sticks of ram from geil i asked the customer service guy and he said he wasnt sure if the spd would read or not,, how do i know if it will work or not? 
your pavilion ze4200 - found the computer listed on hp.com - hp's memory configurator listed a pavilion ze4100 and a ze4300, but no ze4200! 
- crucial.com (memory company) didn't have it listed! 
- kingston.com 
(memory company) has upgrade info. 
here's what kingston has to say: - two memory slots - maximum memory is 1gb (512mb x2) - type: pc2100 (266mhz sodimm) see for yourself: 
for taking the time to help me out. 
i'll look into this
