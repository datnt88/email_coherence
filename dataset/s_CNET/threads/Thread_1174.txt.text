i need to get an ac adapter for my lcd monitor, but i'm having problems finding a compatible one. here's the specs for the original adapter that comes with the monitor: input: 100-240v, 50/60hz output: 12v, 2.09a anyways, my question is would i be able to use an adapter for a different peripheral if the output voltage and amps where higher than the original adapter? i've been looking into universal notebook adapters that have variable output voltages from 15 to 24 volts, and also higher amp output. would one of these adapters work, or would the higher output cause damage? thanks.
the device needs the exact voltage specified, but it will handle more current (power/amps). the circuitry will shunt the excess power, but excess voltage will fry it.
look at these from  they're two listed in 12v/3a range. as for proper usage, you do need the right voltage period, the amps can be higher, but lets not get crazy. i did mention those, they seem to fit what you need and are new and cheap but verify the connection barrel type. part# pwr1207 and pwr1206 good luck -----willy
