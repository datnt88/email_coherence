i just hooked up a widescreen monitor to my dell dimension 4300 with xp pro. is there a way to have the desktop display in 16:9? as it is right now there are black bars on the sides or the image is stretched by the monitor to fill the screen. this is not a big deal for everyday computing (although i'd like to utilize the full potential of the monitor), but for watching dvds the picture is either stretched or small in the middle of the screen instead of the anamorphic widescreen when played on a standalone tv/dvd player. i've been through the screen resolution options in control panel and haven't found a soltution. any help is much appreciated. thanks in advance!
the short answer is that your video mode must support that 1600x1000 (wide) or other wide numbered display and the dvd software will have to use it. some don't. bob
i posted a reply once and it didn't show up, so hopefully thi isn't a double-post. my screen resolution only goes to 800x600. does that mean my vidoe mode doesn't support 1600x1000? if so, what can i do to rectify that? a new video card? thanks for the help, by the way!
the video card driver should be updated, then install the monitor.inf that came with the monitor. if that doesn't extend the settings, then you may need a more capable video card. bob
i had the same problem with a projector get powerstrip - lets you set heaps of settings inc adding screen sizes to the windows defaults...
this is easy to cure if the drivers for the video card support the needed video mode as well as you installing the matching monitor.inf that came with the monitor in question. you have some installing to do. as there is no standard here, i can only offer generic directions. in short, video drivers then the monitor.inf that describes the monitor capabilities. bob
