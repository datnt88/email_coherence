<s> hi i'm an incoming freshman thinking of buying a laptop but i can't decide which laptop to buy, the dell d620 or the apple 13 white inch intel core duo?  </s>
<s> everyone has been advising me to buy mac because the features are great (plus it includes the new isight), but the problem is...apple laptops are not that user friendly.  </s>
<s> dell on the other hand is very user friendly but it's bigger and heavier than apple.  </s>
<s> both have intel core duo as processors, please advise me on what laptop should i buy.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> have you ever used a dell?  </s>
<s> if so then disregard this, but from my experience dells are substandard period.  </s>
<s> if its not 1 thing its another.  </s>
<s> the way they organize & simply operate just doesnt work well for my taste.  </s>
<s> i do everything on a computer, from word to music, to web design, surfing, downloading, etc, & dells just seem to get in my way.  </s>
<s> go w/ the apple.  </s>
<s> previous reply's on this topic, very helpful!  </s>
