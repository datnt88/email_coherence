i bought and installed a belkin 802.11g router in january and i still get dead spots in my 1600 square foot apartment. i think i need a range extender or expander, but those seem to cost more than the router i purchased a few months ago. plus they all seem to have difficulty with the set up and being a novice, i dont think i could get it to work. any easier solutions, or are there expanders that are fairly simple to set up and use? or get a newer - better router? thanks in advance.
things like moving the router to a central and/or open location? sometimes just moving its location around can help. side note: if you use a wireless phone, many are on the same frequency (2.4 ghz) which will knock you off because of interference.
thanks, i bought 5.3ghz phones, so i dont think that is the problem. doesnt my router need to connect to my desktop via a cable?
yes, your router need to connect to the desktop ... if that desktop doesn't use wireless. no, if your desktop use a wireless. place the wifi accesspoint somewhere in the middle of the room... preferably high.. look out for any interference, such as cordless phone, microwave, baby monitor, etc...
