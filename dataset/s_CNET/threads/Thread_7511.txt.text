hi everyone, i have just got an archos 80 cobalt tablet (cheap!). i'm going to take it abroad on holiday. i can turn the wifi off, but will it charge me for data roaming? i'm not sure it's even got it! how do i make sure it's all off? thank you! anne
i see wifi but no way can this run up a data bill on its own. that is, it has no cellular connection so i'd leave the wifi on. bob
thank you that's great!
