<s> which case should i buy?  </s>
<s> there is the praetorian 730 and the antec p180.  </s>
<s> i have researched both and they both seem like good choices.  </s>
<s> i have recently found the antec p180 at provantage for under $130 with shipping, while newegg offers it for $157.72 with shipping, a rather large price difference for this case. the praetorian 730, no matter where one looks for it, is still $160+ with shipping.  </s>
<s> here are the two cases, both very attractive in my opinion.  </s>
<s> praetorian 730 antec p180 thank you!  </s>
<s> others have it for even less... $120 range...  </s>
<s> why pay so much for a case, when you can buy many good quality cases from $50 to $75? put the money in a nice video card or extra ram.  </s>
<s> but since i always favor antec, i'd have to say that. it has better airflow.  </s>
<s> konny  </s>
<s> i was planning on buying a $65 case, but the more expensive cases, generally, have better cooling, a quieter design, a non-flimsy design and overall much better looks.  </s>
<s> i am probably going with the antec.  </s>
