9299	2	563899	5314950	5314852	steven haninger	5/24/12 1:23 pm	1.33786578e12	in a nutshell only	if you don't have the manual, look here:  i'd recommend the hp universal print driver. it does show as compatible with windows 7 and the 2100n. you will need to select the proper driver for your version...either 32 bit or 64 bit. you will need to know or discover the ip address for the printer. if it's at the default, the manual should have that address. hp also has it's own discover and configuration tool...something called jetdirect...but it's been a while for me. in any event, you need the printer to have an ip address within the same network range as that of your laptop. i recommend using static addressing for printers rather than dhcp and printer names. you need to install the driver and configure the port address given to the printer in the printer properties on your laptop. sorry but cannot offer step by step for this but basically this is what you need to do. hope it helps rather than adds to confusion.

(keep wondering if either usb or networking basics weren't as plug-&-play back then ? and how to reconfigure ?) as mentioned, this feels very close to possible, but there is some bottleneck somewhere..... thanks

9299	6	563899	5315022	5314978	steven haninger	5/24/12 5:35 pm	1.3378809e12	we could be all wrong here	in searching through the manual, i did find specs for both the hp2100tn and hp2100m. i was unaware of an &quot;m&quot; version but it may not be us. the &quot;m&quot; version does come with a parallel and localtalk (apple) interface. neither of these will work with your laptop. you did mention some usb symbol but i wonder if this wasn't some kind of 3rd party adapter. if so, those don't tend to work well if at all. you won't have a network (rj-45) port so you're out of luck in that regard. the printer does show ir wireless but that's a technology that didn't catch on. i would doubt your laptop has ir but you could check. if so, it may be an alternative but ir is very distance limited. it may be best to just bank what you've learned and find a newer printer. sorry to say that.
9299	7	563899	5315041	5315010	windot	5/24/12 9:44 pm	1.33789584e12	the frustrating part ...	every time i decide it's not worth it, something about it suggests that it is really really close to working : just now i set up things to print, with the &quot;devices and printers&quot; window open, ready to plug in the printer. next to the icon of the printer it said &quot;hp 2100 pcl6 : offline&quot; when i plugged in the usb end of the cable, that changed right away to &quot;hp 2100 pcl6 : ready&quot; so it's seeing the printer, but just not being cooperative. (because when i tried a print, it changed to &quot;error&quot;). and refused to print, of course. okay. last chance for inspirations, anyone ..... ?
