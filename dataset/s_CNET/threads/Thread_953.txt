(gpu at and under 100 degrees and cpu at and around 70 degrees) i need help modifying it in terms of cooling it down as much as possible. since i am a novice at computer hardware modifications i figured you guys could give me good advice on what i should do to make it run cooler, whether it be new fans, heat sinks, liquid cooling, a new case, etc. if you recommend one of the above can you also suggest a replacement part that i might be able to use? if you need any more information i am more than happy to provide it. and yes i blow the dust out of the fans regularly. thanks a bunch all . -ohno21212
