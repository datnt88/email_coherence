<s> does anybody know anything about fujitsu computers?  </s>
<s> they are a big company over here in japan but i am not sure if they sell their computers back in the the u.s., or maybe they do but under a different name.  </s>
<s> anyway, my current computer is over 5 years old and is pretty much shot.  </s>
<s> instead of trying to have it fixed and upgrade all the old components it would probably be better to just buy a new one.  </s>
<s> i saw the following fujitsu desktop in a computer store near my home as was just wondering if anybody thinks it's any good.  </s>
<s> i tried looking for a computer with similiar stuff on the cnet product reviews site but had no luck.  </s>
<s> so, i am going to try and include as much information as possible in this post and see what people think.  </s>
<s> i apologize in advance for the length.  </s>
<s> model: fujitsu fmv deskpower fmv ce50h7 cpu: amd athlon xp 2800+ cache memory: 256mb (primary); 512mb(secondary) chipset: sis company sis741lv chipset system bus: 333 mhz main memory: standard: 256mb (ddr sdram-dimm, pc3200) slots: 2 open slots upper limit memory: 1 gb monitor: 17&quot; digital lcd (full color 167,700,000 colors) video memory: 32 mb graphics accelerator: sis company sis741lv fdd: optional hdd: 160gb (ultra ata/100, 7200turns/sec) dvd drive: super multi drive (dvd-ram: read 3x/write 3x; dvd-r: read 8x/write 8x; dvd-rw: read 8x/write 4x; dvd+r: read 8x/write 8x; dvd+rw: read 8x/write 4x; dvd-rom: read 12x; cd: read 32x; cd-r: write 24x; cd-rw: write 10x) audio function: internal chipset + ac97 codec speakers: internal (inside monitor) modem: 56kbps (v.90 standard) 100base-tx/10base-t tv capability: yes it also has 2 slots for pc cards, 1 for sd cards, 6 usb ports, input for s-video or for three color vcr input cables, digital audio input and other stuff.  </s>
<s> can record upto 140 hours of tv programs directly onto the dvd-ram.  </s>
<s> price is 160,000 yen ($1300-$1400?) even though the there a few things that probably could be better (ie: (1) the primary cache is only 256, (2) the cpu is not pentium 4 (3) the graphics card seems to be an intergrated one (4) the systems bus is not 400mhz or above) is this a good deal or should i keep looking?  </s>
<s> it's just another pc. i can't comment on the price since here it's double what we pay for such.  </s>
<s> see bob  </s>
<s> thanks for the info.  </s>
<s> i figured that prices here were more quite high compared to back in the u.s., but i guess there's no way around that. it looks like that gateway pc doesn't come with a monitor.  </s>
<s> according to the same website, monitors look to be about $300 and up so i guess that takes a little bite out of the price difference.  </s>
<s> couldn't tell from the page, but does that pc include dvd-ram as well?  </s>
<s> and, did it have tv capability?  </s>
<s> thanks again for the link.  </s>
<s> it's dead here.  </s>
<s> there is no interest in dvd-ram and if i wanted such a drive, it's about 30 bucks on the used market.  </s>
<s> as to tv cards, such are 49 bucks retail.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks again for the reply.  </s>
<s> that's interesting.  </s>
<s> i think dvd-ram is a big selling point over here.  </s>
<s> tv cards are also a big selling point as well.  </s>
<s> the sales rep at the store i went to said that it would be better to get a computer that came with a tv card preinstalled since the good ones cost about $300 (my guess) on their own.  </s>
<s> your replies have made me start to seriously consider ordering a computer from a u.s. company over the net.  </s>
<s> can you or anybody else recommend any going places that ship internationally and offer good support?  </s>
<s> also, i would need to get really good japanese language capability so do you think i'll need a japanese os for that?  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> i've found &quot;support&quot; to be only for the hardware.  </s>
<s> some owners lose their cool when they find out that software support isn't being offered at the discount prices. is this ok? bob  </s>
