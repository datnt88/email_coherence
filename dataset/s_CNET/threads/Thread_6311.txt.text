have an old toshiba portege 3015 ultraportable. it's so close to the size of a modern netbook it made me wonder if i could load netbook software to make it a useful machine again. right now it's on windows me. (when's the last time you saw that?) current specs are: intel pentium&#63720; 266mhz (2.0v/2.5v) w/mmx technology integrated coprocessor yes processor cache 32kb: (16kb code; 16kb data) external data bus width 64 bit external data/address bus speed 66 mhz memory--maxed out at 96 meg
have been sensible choice, but given xp's base minimum requirements, it would actually make the old toshiba crawl instead of flying. instead, i would just do a reload of winme to clear out all the old junks and make it useful as simple.. err.. web-browsing (if it is ever simple webpages).
netbooks have much better hardware and you'll need to go down to a low resource linux and may not be worth the effort due to your laptop's graphics limitation (you may only have 512kb graphics to 1mb which was the norm at the time).
i would say windows 2000 might run ok, i would say something like menuet os,
