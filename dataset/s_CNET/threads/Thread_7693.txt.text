i've bought an lg dp1w with wifi recently. i tried to connect my lacie 1tb harddrive to it, but it wouldn't recognise it. the harddrive is in ntfs file system. my friend has a wd harddrive connected to a wd multimedia player, and it works perfectly. his harddrive has an ntfs file system as well, so this is why i get confused. is it because his mm player and hd have the same manufacturer? i know that you're going to tell me to format it to fat32, but i know that the max file size there is 4gb, and this is not a solution for me, because i bought it to watch hi-def films with it.
the situation is not really clear. - is it relevant your lg has wifi? - how do you connect the drive? - does the manual of the lg say they support an ntfs disk? and to experiment: - does your friends player recognise your drive? - does your lg recognize your friends drive? kees
thanks for replying. i guess wifi isn't relevant, sorry. i connect my drive to the mm player via usb. i think i threw the manunal out. i thought about experimenting and testing that out once i get back, i'm currently not home. i'll have to wait till sunday evening. i'll post the results then! and thanks again!
i've exactly the same problem. probably it's a combination between the manufacturer of the device and the external hdd. tried to contact lg, but haven't got a response yet. keep me posted about your progress..
