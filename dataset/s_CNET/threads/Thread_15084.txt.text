i curently have a 120gb hdd with a 2mb cache and runs at 7200 rpm. will there be a significant increase in performance( meaning i'll be actually be able to tell )by getting a newer one with a 16mb cache also running at 7200 rpm? also will getting a larger one make a difference? in other words is there any performance benefits in having a 250gb hdd vs 120gb one assuming both are exactly the same otherwise? i really don't need more storage since i barley use 1/4 of the current 120gb, but if getting a 250gb will mean better performance then i'll spend the extra $$$.
if your hard drive is more than 2 generations old (and it probably is with only 2mb cache), then you could well see a noticable improvement from a new drive. the extra cache will help and the transfer rates of hard drives have steadily increased over the past 5 years so you could jump from 30mb/sec to 50mb/sec which means quicker boot, quicker app startup, etc.
my take is you might see some difference as a result of adding a newer drive but that will be largely because of the the greater data density per platter (areal density), vice the 16mb cache buffer. hdd mfgs have managed to increase the data density per platter significantly over the past few years from 10gbs, 15gbs and 20gbs/platter to 100gbs or 125gbs per platter. so if you look at hdds that rotate at the same speed, 7,200 rpm (some ides run at 10k rpms), but the data density increases significantly over the same distance ... it stands to reason there will be some increased speed for both disk reads and writes due to increased data density alone. the question is, if the files are relatively small, how much gain will you actually see the day-to-day or normal use of your computer ? hope this helps. vapcmd
if your a gamer&gt;&gt;&gt;go for it. if you have extra cash&gt;&gt;&gt;go for it. for gp usageage..doubt you'll get your money's worth. if this is a perf issue... unless i could prove the hd was the cause i'd take my money and look elsewhere.
