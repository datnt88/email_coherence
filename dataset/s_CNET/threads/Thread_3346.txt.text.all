<s> i finally have a network.  </s>
<s> when i clik on &quot;view workgroup computers&quot; i see the computer i am networked to.  </s>
<s> when i clik on the computer though, i get an error message: this computer is not accessible.  </s>
<s> please contact the server administrator to see if you have permission to access this computer.  </s>
<s> i set absolutely zero security.  </s>

<s> with no os mentioned, i can't tell you any direct actions, but for xp, firewalls are the number 1 reason i see people fail at making a network.  </s>
<s> next are things like. 1. didn't install drivers.  </s>
<s> 2. invalid configurations (example?  </s>
<s> cable modem to hub, pcs to hub, no router) 3. didn't ask the user account to the xp machine and the client... has most of this.  </s>

<s> what is the user thing?  </s>
<s> if so, you didn't read the articles.  </s>
<s> if you won't, then what to do?  </s>

<s> on my laptop i'm signed in as myself.  </s>
<s> that myself needs a password to get in. the desktop signs in automatically becuase there is only one account, no password.  </s>
<s> if that is what you were talking about, i pat myself on the back for understanding.  </s>
<s> and your article is also in nerd-ese.  </s>
<s> i know what a ping is, but i sure as anything dont know how to send one.  </s>
<s> and he isn't any clearer about that.  </s>

<s> i see you found how to control the firewall so that's a good step in the right direction.  </s>
<s> i offer zero support for zone alarm as you can tell.  </s>
<s> that's for zonelabs to do, so i leave that to them.  </s>
