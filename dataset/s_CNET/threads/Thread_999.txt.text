hi am very new to networking.could any one brief me on what are all required to connect 2 systems which are hardly a kilometer away using wireless things.and could u please brief me on how and where to get the systems at a much cheaper rates(can also be a united state related site).actually one of my friends is have a broad band connection so we thought of sahring it.so what brand can i go for the best out of it (wireless router and pci cards) and what the approximate cost would be?
standard wireless equipment might be able to go 50 meters through unobstructed outdoor space. 10 meters if there are obstructions, such as trees. a kilometer is feasible only under very good conditions and with specialized adaptations of the equipment by an experienced technician. sorry. dw
you should look at parkervision equipment for max distance using off-the-shelf equipment.
