okay, new egg wouldn't accept any return except for the power supply so the replacement is on its way... so in the mean time i am in a predicament. i bought a cheap video card from wal-mart (ati radeon 9500 agp) and installed it into the motherboard, turned the power on, and there was no beeping screeching sound like there was before, everything was running and seemed to be fine. i get no display on my monitor though when hooking it up through the card on vga... is there something i have done wrong? or could this be the affect of damage done to my motherboard? is there some ways i can test this now that i have the video card in without problems but get no display?
we then may able to check out some other things; any onboard video? right slot? are you able to try the card in another slot in another computer? did you install the drivers before putting the card in? ~ibrahim
i just realized that i created a new post instead of putting that last message into the thread it was supposed to go to... here is the link:  you'll get more information if you read some of that...
