hi, i'm looking to do the same thing and would love some feedback on cd dvd printers and publishers from someone who has.
- some info on the volume (1 a year, 1000 a day?) might be useful. - burning and labeling are different things. should they come in one device? - what do you mean with &quot;publishers&quot;? kees
i work for a church. i am looking for machine which an burn and label it automatically...
is a burner that will also burn the label. it will be a burner with &quot;lightscribe&quot; support.
i think you should try xlnt idea nexis pro black jack dvd it can easily burn 50-60 cd dvd's per hour with 6 color ink catridges. compare to other brands it has got a excellent robotic technology and advanced features.
