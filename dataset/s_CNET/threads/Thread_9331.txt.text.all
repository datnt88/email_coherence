<s> hello, i'm currently building my first computer.  </s>
<s> i'm following the same parts as the $647 pc recommendation from the magazine maximum pc. the parts are: cpu: amd anthlon ii x4 620 motherboard: gigabyte ga-ma74gm-s2 memory (ram): patriot 4gb ddr2/800 video card: sapphire radeon hd 5770 hard drive: seagate 500gb barracuda 7200.12 cd drive (optical drive): samsung sh-s223c power supply: cooler master rs-460 the recommended case was &quot;rosewill r220&quot; but apparently they aren't in production anymore.  </s>
<s> i don't know much about computer cases so i need some help on finding the right case that's affordable at a decent price and supports those parts.  </s>
<s> also, if there's other recommendations on other parts, please let me know.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> you need now and possibly use later ?  </s>

<s> like the title, a case below $100 in its original price is fine with me.  </s>
<s> in response to the slots, i want something like: 4 - external 5.25&quot; drive bays 1 - external 3.5&quot; drive bays 4 - internal 3.5&quot; drive bays 7 - expansion slots  </s>
<s> set the case criteria (with or without psu) anywhere you want.  </s>
<s> lots of option let us know what looks good to you.  </s>

<s> i found some cases off newegg.com that might fit what i want. is there anything in particular i should be aware of when finding a case?  </s>
<s> how will i know if it'll fit my video card since i've heard that some cases have problems fitting newer video cards.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure if this is true or not so i want to make sure.  </s>
<s> minis could be a problem....they're not too deep front to back.  </s>
<s> specifically which are you looking at ?  </s>
