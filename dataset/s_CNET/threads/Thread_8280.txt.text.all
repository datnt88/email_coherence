<s> this may be something that has already been discussed...i have a pc now and take a lot of large digital pictures.  </s>
<s> i am looking to get an external harddrive to store my photo's on.  </s>
<s> i am also going to be purchasing a mac soon...that brings me to my quesiton...if i buy a hard drive and connect it to my pc and dump all of my pictures on it, will i be able to then connect it to my mac (when i get it) without losing any of the pictures?  </s>
<s> or is it better to wait to get the hard drive and continue to store pictures on cd's for the time being?  </s>
<s> hi if you're buying a new mac i can't see a problem cheers pod  </s>
<s> if it were me and i wasn't going to use the pc after getting the mac, i'd continue as you're doing now.  </s>
<s> once you get the mac and get the pics moved, then take the pc hdd, put it in an external enclosure and use it as extra backup.  </s>
<s> you might also consider putting your important stuff on dvds and store them offsite ... just in case.  </s>
