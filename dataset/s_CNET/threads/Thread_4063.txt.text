can the screen of a netbook with no webcam be turned into a remote viewing device by an outside source?
i own an &quot;ip camera&quot; and can remotely view what the ip camera is seeing. so unless i misunderstand the question, my answer is yes. the outside source is the ip camera which i am remotely viewing with my netbook. bob
i have a netbook that does not have a webcam. i think a hacker may be using my screen to view what i am doing in my home. wanted to know if that is even possible. for a hacker to hack into my computer and use my screen as a viewing device.
sounds like the old &quot;can they watch me through my tv&quot; question. same answer. bob
