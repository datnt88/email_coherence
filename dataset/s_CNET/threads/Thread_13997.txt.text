hello all i'm looking to purchase a 500 gb external hard drive to do backups. my computer is win xp sp3 with usb 2.0 ports. i have norton ghost v 15. i've researched and have seen both good and bad for both seagate and wd drives. realizing individuals wants/needs/opinions are specific to an individual, i would like some feedback on what people think of the above manufacturers and the various drives they produce. i'm leaning towards a desktop external rather than a portable, just for the sake of the desktop having a connection to a power supply that's not the computer. this drive would be used once a week, explicitly for backing up the internal drive. however, i am not adverse to purchasing 2 drives and doing a 'double' backup every week. any comments are appreciated. thanks
given the choice of either seagate or wd, i would choose wd every time without hesitation. all three seagate external drives i had failed within 9 months &amp; started behaving erratically well before that. by contrast, my wd replacements have given me no trouble at all.
i have a wd elements which i was suppose to use as a backup but got lazy and used it twice when visiting my brother in another state who would put movies etc on it. found on a the second trip i could not drag or copy anything off it. had i/o error had it checked and told it was not going to work. my brother is advising me to get a 1t seagate passport as he thinks wd's are rubbish but i see the consensus is divided. i have been looking at the wd my book elite 1t but i am so confused what to get. i am not tech savvy just want to back pics and family history records. thanks appreciate any advise
maybe it's time to have one of each make?
