<s> what would you say it's the best buy?  </s>
<s> has anyone experience with the new intel-pentium d? i like to buy a new pc (tower) but i hesitate between intel pentium 4 or d. what is the difference between pentium and celeron?  </s>
<s> i have now an amd athlon 1300 (an upgrade after a pentium 2) with xp professional, but i suspect that the amd athlon isn't compatible with all the microsoft programmas or do i see this wrong?  </s>
<s> since this upgrade,2 years ago, my pc acts like a lunatic (i mean it!) after uncountable formatting i always manage to let the him work (properly more or less) for a month or two, then the troubles start all over again.  </s>
<s> no virusses but crossed &quot;things&quot;, keyboard that jumps between azerty and qwerty in the mids of a sentence, the pc blocks,the pc restarts on his own,he says the hard disk is full but indicates 10 giga of the 20 i have thats taken, blue pages, no more the possibilty of ctrl-alt-delete (he forgets this things!!?) and so on.  </s>
<s> now i have had it, i want another pc but wich one? the printer i have is new, screen and cd-rom + scanner dates of 1998.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> cpu, they have more cache, and many can support higher fsb's.  </s>
<s> main line is p4 and athlon, as opposed to celeron and sempron.  </s>
<s> amd absolutely supports all ms programs as well as any other that intel's cpu do.  </s>
<s> have never idea who told you that the amd didn't.  </s>
<s> obviously someone selling intels.  </s>
<s> one could simply clean up the problems with the old computer.  </s>
<s> simply appears that the old spyware, malware, trojans, worms, virus have attacked it.  </s>
<s> many posts in the virus forum, also posts by robert proffitt, and grif giving a list of things to do to clean up the system.  </s>
<s> don't bother saying that you have an av program, most of the new stuff simply disables your av program, also disable antu spyware et al. a clean scan from a new download is required.  </s>
<s> one of the cpu's that get really hot.  </s>
<s> be sure to take the cover off of the system, clean out all dust bunnies, especially from the fans and intake screens.  </s>
<s> be certain that all fans are running at the proper speed.  </s>
<s> thank you for the hint, i will try to clean out the dust in my tower.  </s>
<s> i hope that you are right.  </s>
<s> i will start by that.  </s>
<s> can it be that some things in the tower can &quot;tremble&quot; loose due to passing trains?  </s>
<s> with your help i hope that the pc holds it till springtime, the time i hope to have saved enough money to buy a tower with a hard disk with more space than the 20 giga i have now.  </s>
<s> (forgive me my crooked english, i am belgian living now in france and not used anymore to write in english) thank you again.  </s>
<s> lisette  </s>
<s> however if one does, it will be fairly obvious which one it was.  </s>
<s> however while the cover is off, with all power removed, why not simply push on all connectors to improve the connection in the event any had loosened over time, especially if you moved from belgium to france with this computer.  </s>
<s> could also remove and insert them again, that can be better yet because it will get rid of any corrosion that may have built up on some of the contacts.  </s>
<s> don't forget to touch something metal to ground yourself out.  </s>
<s> a static shock to the innards of a computer will have you out of a computer fast.  </s>
<s> anyways, a good way to rid static electricty is always sit on a wooden chair, on a wooden floor, with bare feet!  </s>
<s> (sorry)  </s>
<s> sense. if the body has accumulated a charge, tell me please, how the static charge gets dissipated while sitting on the chair, it will bleed off possibly, but please explain how long one must sit on the chair until the charge is completely dissipated.. i see no way that your message added anything to the lady's plight.  </s>
<s> yes i failed to alert her to esd in my post, but the next post clarified that in anunderstandable manner.  </s>
<s> that when you want to open the tower, you have to disconnect it with the little button on the back, take the electric cord away and touch the metal cover to loose the static electricity.  </s>
<s> that's correct no?but i can imagine there is some fright left in the box itself (like an old television).  </s>
<s> i didn't open the tower yet (lack of time: working from 8 till 18). the last time i openend the tower was when i installed the memup internal dvd-writer (witch by the the way, after 1,5 year,now refuses to burn dvd-r or +r but burns cd's -r,-rw,+r,+rw and dvd-rw and +rw without any problems!!?) i promise i will do it tomorrow, maybe i'll find a mouse or something..hihihi o, by the way, my beautifull blue light that lightend the front of the tower, went out....i can take a look at that too.  </s>
<s> thanks you all.  </s>
<s> i will let you all know how it went.  </s>
<s> yes, i opened the tower and &quot;spring-cleaned&quot; it.  </s>
<s> there was a &quot;little&quot; dust there (i couldn't even see the fans properly), so i took a screwdriver, little paintbrush and the respirator and went on cleaning for 1 hour.  </s>
<s> i even asked my husband to open the &quot;energybox&quot; to get acces to that fan too.  </s>
<s> i unplugged and replugged all the wires as far as the cooperated easely, the others (really sticky ones) i contented to give them a little push.however i didn't found any ghosts... no electric shocks, mayby because i left the tower off for a whole night.  </s>
<s> so far, so good.  </s>
<s> till now, the pc didn't have any weird behaviour.  </s>
<s> one last question: i have now a hard disk of 20 giga.  </s>
<s> can i replace it for a bigger one (say, 80 giga) with the configuration i have now?  </s>
<s> a 80 gb drive.  </s>
<s> [that is, to recognize the full capacity, the drive will certainly run, possibily with less capacity].  </s>
<s> check to see iof there is a bios update for the computer.  </s>
<s> can you tell us what make and model it is?  </s>
<s> also what operating system, this may affect what you can do.  </s>
<s> as to a drive &quot;running&quot;, virtually any size will run, but the bios can limit how much of the drive can be used.  </s>
<s> here's a link to an article on the various drive size barriers over the years.  </s>
<s> fairly long because it goes back to day one. the latest is the 137 gb limit and that not only requires a correct bios but if using windows xp needs sp 1 to be installed.  </s>
<s> the other issue may be related to installing the operating system and the drivers, if you are using a proprietary system [dell, hp, compaq, gateway et al]  </s>
<s> i mislead the facture of my update but i found the manual of the motherboard.  </s>
<s> it is the manual for the v266b m/b for socket-a athlon/duron processor.  </s>
<s> specifications?  </s>

<s> the manual describes nicely the things that the mobo can support [use], but it doesn't tell us which of those things you actually are using.  </s>
<s> you told us the cpu, but the mobo supports either sdram or ddr sdram.  </s>
<s> we don't need to know if all you want to do is find out if it will take a 80 gb hard drive, however it would be good if you know.  </s>
<s> maybe do a google search for belarc and everest.  </s>
<s> download them and run them [either from your hard drive or from a floppy].  </s>
<s> they will tell you virtually everything about your computer.  </s>
<s> nice info to print out and always have available.  </s>
<s> re the larger drive, you/we need to know what version your bios is presently.  </s>
<s> you can get that by checking the very first screen that comes up when you boot. the bios version will be noted on that sceen.  </s>
<s> then go to the mobo mfr's website to see if there is a later version of the bios.  </s>
<s> if you provide the name of the maker of the mobo and the model number we can look it up. the v266b is possibly the model, but who is the manufacturer?? i'll be seeing if i can find any info.  </s>
<s> if this is it, it supports ata 133, which would make it imo handle an 80 gb hard drive.  </s>
<s> i saved the link to the manual and could download it to look at if you have any questions [simply looking over your shoulder to read it.  </s>
<s> lol]. it will take either sdram, or ddr sdram [but not a mix].  </s>
<s> really doesn't matter for the drive question, but just wondering.  </s>
<s> still can check to see if there is a later bios.  </s>
<s> here's a link to the mobo [in english] at jetway's site;  </s>
<s> for the 266b was a13 dated 10/7/2003.  </s>
<s> all it did was update the amd cpu name string.  </s>
<s> certainly nothing important.  </s>
