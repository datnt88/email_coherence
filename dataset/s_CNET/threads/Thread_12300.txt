11978	8	9993	116406	116396	scott swinyard	1/30/04 1:24 pm	1.07546904e12	re: grouch?	i have no objection to asking all in one for conveniance, but as i said when i do that people seem to pick and choose what they want to answer and then tell me what they want or what they seem to think i need to know. i took to asking specific questions in seperate posts realizing all of this. frequently when i ask a question i don't get an answer but rather a generic treatment of the issue it was based upon. i frequently if not usually already know those things. i am not intending to be negative. i know this is a voluntary forum and appreciate the assistance you give me when you can. i'll try to keep it simple.
11978	9	9993	116436	116398	ray harinec	1/30/04 1:46 pm	1.07547036e12	if you want to hold to 90 f go to the overclocker's forum	and see the various devices that they use. if you simply use fan rpm as a major solution, you won't be able to hear yourself think. those forums will give you various methods to try to acheive 90 f [at the thermistor that touches the cpu underside].
11978	10	9993	116439	116406	ray harinec	1/30/04 1:48 pm	1.07547048e12	you may have misunderstood me.	i intended to agree with your posting one item at a time.
11978	11	9993	116470	116398	ray harinec	1/30/04 2:19 pm	1.07547234e12	scott, understand the physics.	that cpu is dissipating about 60 to 65 watts [ever touch an illuminated 60 watt light bulb?]. that wattage is being dissipated over a surface of about 1 square inch. what you see on the cpu is a heat spreader which is about twice the size of the actual piece of silicon. intel is simply telling you that if the air at that distance above the hub of the hsfan is held at or below that temp the device temp will be at the temp range specified in their charts, based on using their hsf. they can't provide the data for some one else's hsf. are you also aware that such a solid state device can have a useful life measured in tens of years running at 45 c? if the device gets past infant mortality [a month or so], it will possibly outlast you. certainly should last well past where one would have gone to a new computer with later super technology. doesn't seem that it is worth spending too much effort on. unless you simply take it as a challemge. then go to liquid cooling. there are a number of those available.

11978	16	9993	117066	116916	ray harinec	1/31/04 6:38 am	1.07553108e12	two thoughts.	one: simply look at the subject line of the first reply to your original post. had you asked what spread spectrum was, how to mount the hard drive and the temp question all in one post, imho that would have been counterproductive. second: with the case that you have, and with use of sufficient number of fans, location, and direction of airflow for each, i would think that you can get the cpu temp into the low to mid 40 c's. [i have a 2.6 running at that at work with the top exhaust fan and 3 others plus the two in the power supply]. the heatsink fan and one of the power supply fans are temperature contolled for speed. remember that your room ambient temp affects the interior temp. if you run the room at 68 f vs 75f that is a delta t of 7 f degrees. [about 4 c degrees]. this difference will be reflected in the ambient air temp inside the case.
