hello, i'm looking for a good quality photo printer (5 or more colors) that will print on many types of media and up to 13x19 paper. i've read the cnet editor recommendations, but i won't buy another epson stylus due to all the problems i've had with mine, the printer where i work, and those that my sister has experienced. canon's i9900 looked promising until i discovered one must use only canon paper (how realistic is that!?). i would appreciate any suggestions as i am completely without a printer now (the epson stylus 1280 i have has quit after three years of light use). thank you for any suggestions!
i too got fed up with the epson. i had two that failed after a short time with a printhead issue. i switched to hp in order to avoid that. if you want to be able to print 13x19, there will be fewer choices. while i do not have one of these, here is a link to a review of one:  also, photosmart printers can print directly from the camera, media or computer and this one (hp 8750)has built in network capabilities. of course with the capablility to print 13x19 pictures, you have to expect a pricetag that is hefty also.
thank you for your suggestion. i'm checking into it!
