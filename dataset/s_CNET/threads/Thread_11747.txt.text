at the moment my computer doesn't recognise when devices are plugged into my usb ports (not a hub). so now my printer, mp3 player and external hardrive aren't recognised when they are plugged in. this has happened without them being removed or in any way altered. i run windows xp sp2 and all unused usb ports in the device manager claim they are working properly, however when i get to the &quot;unkown device&quot; (my printer and.or external hardrive - both are listed as unknown devices) i get told the drivers aren't installed - yet when i try to intall them the computer won't recognise the device i want to install drivers to..........any ideas?
the motherboard usb drivers. have you installed them? your question is very light on system information so that's about all i can say.
well luckily its all come back and it's working now - but i expect sumthing to go wrong soon because it did this before. it wouldn't recognise the printer and external h/d and just came back at a random time - which doesnt help because i dont what the cause is!
