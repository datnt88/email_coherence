<s> i do... see a bit of lagging... while loading the winxp.  </s>
<s> help !!! gsoul2soul  </s>
<s> 80gb hard drive = udma5 = ata/100 = 100mb/second 20gb hard drive = udma2 = ata/33 = 33mb/second other speed factors: - amound of disk cache (512k vs 8mb, larger is better) - rotation speed (4500rpm vs 7200rpm, faster/higher is better) you want the os to be on the fastest hard drive (80gb), on the lowest ide channel (usually labeled channel 0), and as a master.  </s>
<s> use an 80 wire (40 pin) ultra ata cable that is rated for ata/100 or ata/133.  </s>
<s> i'd put the 20gb hd as a slave on whatever channel it likes.  </s>
<s> some older hd's and optical drives don't cooperate in certain positions on the same channel as other drives.  </s>
<s> that q fireball is pretty loud in comparison, isn't it?  </s>
<s> i still have a few of those around.  </s>
<s> ...look in device manager to see if each ide channel is in dma mode and not the slower pio mode.  </s>
<s> he he he... yes!!! it can be a lillllll loud... ha ha ha  </s>
