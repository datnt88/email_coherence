hello everyone, i'm just looking to upgrade from my old computer to something a little more modern. i mostly use the the computer to browse the internet and play games. i'm not looking to spend too much on a new pc but this is the best deal i have found: dell xps 420 processor: intel core2 q6600 quad-core (8mb l2 cache,2.4ghz,1066fsb) operating system: genuine windows vista home premium with digital cable support memory: 4gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 667mhz - 4 dimms hard drive: 500gb - 7200rpm, sata 3.0gb/s, 16mb cache optical drive: blu-ray disc combo (dvd+/-rw + bd-rom) monitors: no monitor video card: 512mb nvidia geforce 8800 gt sound card: integrated 7.1 channel audio tv tuner & video xcelerator: hauppauge hvr1250 hybrid tv tuner and remote keyboard: dell usb keyboard mouse: dell optical usb mouse bluetooth and media reader: dell 19 in 1 media reader with bluetooth floppy & media reader: dell media card reader included in dell bluetooth package wi-fi and modem: 56k pci data fax modem all this runs for $1,214.92 with taxes and shipping. tell me what you guys think.
good deal, i am seriously considering purchasing that machine. i would recommend a downgrade of the ram from 4gb down to 3gb (windows 32bit can only use a maximum of 3.3 gb). and i noticed that you're &quot;upgrading&quot; from the original 3gb that runs at 800mhz, the 3gb at 800mhz is more suitable for gaming. also, keep in mind though, that there have been numerous dell threads that talk about how the esata port doesn't work. it's fixable, but the current solution is a complete clean reinstall of vista. if that's not a huge problem for you, then this deal definitely looks really sweet.
i'm going to decide on this config by the end of the day... yes or no... hmmm.. dell xps 420 processor: intel core2 q6600 quad-core (8mb l2 cache,2.4ghz,1066fsb) operating system: genuine windows vista home premium with digital cable support memory: 3gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 800mhz - 4 dimms hard drive: 500gb - 7200rpm, sata 3.0gb/s, 16mb cache optical drive: blu-ray disc combo (dvd+/-rw + bd-rom) monitors: no monitor video card: 512mb nvidia geforce 8800 gt sound card: integrated 7.1 channel audio tv tuner & video xcelerator: hauppauge hvr1250 hybrid tv tuner and remote keyboard: dell usb keyboard mouse: dell optical usb mouse bluetooth and media reader: dell 19 in 1 media reader floppy & media reader: dell media card reader included in dell bluetooth package wi-fi and modem: internal pci 802.11g wireless network card grand total of: $1,116.30
i'm considering this configuration (almost) also, but they don't offer it with windows xp. they do offer their xps 210 computers with xp. i'm going to call them today to see if they'll make an exception.
yeah the esata isn't really a big deal for me. so i should just get it with the 3gb then huh? im down for that too. i really wanted this to be available with xp too. i've heard of way too many glitches and problems with vista. is there anything else that i need if i wanted to use my 42&quot; hdtv with this machine? if so what else would i need?
hey if you give them a call can you let me know what they said? if they say yeah then id give them a call as well
just finished chatting with the dell guy. getting this computer with xp just isn't an option. does anyone have any experience installing xp on this computer, or is it a &quot;vista&quot; centric computer?
i remember somebody telling me that one can install both os on the same computer and that you get the option of choosing whether you want to use xp or vista. i remember reading that somewhere a long time ago. anybody know if i right or wrong? as you can probably tell im not really great at computers.
