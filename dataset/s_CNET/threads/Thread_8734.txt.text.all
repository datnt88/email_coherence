i am running a 2100s rev320r i20 scsi v001.38 in raid5 we want to upgrade the drives to 300gb. 
according to documentation i should go into storage manager mark the drive as failed, replace it with the new drive, let it rebuild then repeat the process for each drive. 
i have installed storage manager' version 4.40.00 (16593) but it tells me that no controllers were found. 
time to call its maker and arrange for repair or replacements. 
the drives are working fine. the system is fine, just approaching capacity. 
we can access the raid in bios with smor but want to do the drive upgrade with system up and running not to disrupt users. 
the product has failed. 
ask its maker what to do next.
