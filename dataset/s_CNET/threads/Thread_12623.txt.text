i'm curious if a gigabyte ga-ep45-ud3p lga 775 intel p45 atx intel motherboard would be compatible with an intel xeon x3370 yorkfield 3.0ghz 12mb l2 cache lga 775 95w quad-core server processor. i have researched their fsbs and they can run at a frequency of 1333mhz. the motherboard has others it can at it's max is 1333mhz and is the same rate as the xeons frequency, also the motherboard can run quad-core chip sets. the lga is the same as already indicated. i'm positive even though the cpu is a server cpu type that it will fit and run on a desktop motherboard. i'm i correct or is this impossible?
the only difference between a xeon and core2quad is the xeon has a bit of microcode that allows it be used in a dual socket mobo. otherwise the x3370 is the same chip as the q9650. your gigabyte mobo will handle that xeon fine.
thanks man. it not being on the list of the manufacture pages cpu support info made me a little skeptical about it. so that difference in the electrode is not critical it will work fine. that's good! i posted on other forums as well about this to get input and website references. i heard the xeon is considered a core2 quad on yahoo answers by a person that replied.
i mean microcode. whoops i had the word electrode in my head for some reason while typing.
so i can guarantee it works.
hmm.. then i shouldn't have an issue with it then at all. but the difference between the xeon x3370 and the core2 q9650 are not very different at all. so in benchmarks for handling 3d applications like maya must be talking about the more workstation xeons for server boards that hardcore 3d animators use for their renderfarms. thanks again, i think i may consider the q9650 over the xeon, the only difference is the microcode and l1 and l2 cache speeds. other than that i believe they are the same.
