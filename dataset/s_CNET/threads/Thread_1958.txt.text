everytime i pop a dvd into the drive, my entire computer just freezes and windvd stops responding. i'm using a sony dvd model ddu1621. when i load an image file of a dvd and run it, it runs fine. any idea what's the problem?
yes the dvd may be bad. take it to another machine and try it, or try another dvd in your machine. that isolates your ide port and cable and the dvd. since it is not the dvd's it must be the drive or the connections. presumes you haven't loaded some sort of virus.
this is a common issue when an os like windows is installed, but the installer (person) doesn't install motherboard drivers, the latest bios or more. i see this a lot. bob
