<s> hello i've been looking around for a tv tuner that can broadcast my tv at home back to me away from home.  </s>
<s> so far i've only been able to find the slingbox as a viable option.  </s>
<s> are there any other types of this kind of device similar to the slingbox?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance - nick  </s>
<s> you could home-brew your own, but slingbox does all the work for you.  </s>
<s> unless you're a hobbyist, go with slingbox or get something to convert your programs to divx and burn them to cd/dvd.  </s>
<s> a single layer dvd can hold 12+ hours of divx high-res video.  </s>
<s> something sort of like sagetv?  </s>
