i may be too young for this forum, but i need some help deciding on a laptop for school-related uses. as you may have guessed, i am paying with my own money and am extremely limited by price. i dont know if anyone will want to hunt a laptop down for me but i need: 1 gb of ram 12&quot; screen &gt;1.5 ghz built-in wireless price below $1,000 (as low as possible would be good) anyway, any help will be greatly appreciated! thanks doc
sorry, this is the wrong forum! still, if you could help.
boy, how things have changed; i can't remember ever needing a laptop all through high school, and i'm only 19 now. but yeah, if you need an inexpensive laptop then dell would probably be in your budget. since you're not using it for gaming then 1000 should be more than enough. you may be looking for a mac though, since you posted in the mac section, but an ibook is slightly under 1000 before tax, and will most definitly meet your needs.
go for the acer aspire3003wlmi, dvd burning, 15.4&quot; widescreen active matrx display, wireless, 80gb hd, upgradeable ram upto 2gb, etc. all for $699 it is fantastic
...i'm 14. look at dell.
i'd say the ibook is a nice fairly portable laptop, you could probably pick one up cheap from the apple refurbished store:  the standard 12&quot; ibook with 1gb ram is $1099 new.
