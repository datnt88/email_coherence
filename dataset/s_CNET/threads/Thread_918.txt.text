okay, so i want to upgrade my computers ram, graphics card, and power supply.here is my computer.  i have integrated crappy graphics so whenever i run a game like fable 3 it's very choppy. i also heard that my power supply sucks, and my ram is okay.what video card should i get that will fit my computer? do all power supply's fit any computer?basically asking what ram/power supply/video card i should get to upgrade my computer. i want to play pretty good games on it but my budget isn't huge. thanks.
how many bucks do you want to spend? hp shows w7 64 bit installed......is that true?
the ati 5450 continues to pop up as a nice enough card that can go in and work even on a slim power supply. you can research benchmarks and more. here are starter links.   notice those power comparisons? this should give the machine a nice boost without a power supply swap. bob
