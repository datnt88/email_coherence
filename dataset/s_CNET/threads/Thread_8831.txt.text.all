<s> i'm going to upgrade my computer soon.  </s>
<s> so i'll have: amd sempron 3300 2ghz 1gb ram sony 16x/48x dvd rom drive nvidia geforce 6600 i'm wondering what games i could run smoothly with these specs?  </s>
<s> i've heard that sempron is better than celeron for gaming.  </s>
<s> i'm particulary interested in playing fps's, half life 2, far cry, halo etc. could i play these smoothly?  </s>
<s> (i'm doubting i can play f.e.a.r?)  </s>
<s> 1. all.  </s>
<s> here's why.  </s>
<s> i would only need to trim back on the display pixel count or size from x by y to 800 by 600 or maybe a few less effects.  </s>
<s> 2. not all.  </s>
<s> here's why.  </s>
<s> many of those games are programmed to take advantage of hardware that has yet to be designed.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks bob, very.. in depth.  </s>
<s> i'm still deciding on what graphics card to get, and the radeon x700se seems appealing.. still, could all change.  </s>
<s> any other opinions?  </s>
<s> but i'd skip the sempron and head to any 64-bit cpu offering.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'm on a budget  </s>
<s> havent played far cry but i have played halo, half life 2 and splintercell chaos theory on a system built around a amd 64 3200+ and an x700 pro and they've all done quite well.  </s>
<s> so do i surmise from your post that the 6600 isnt the gt model or above?  </s>
<s> if it is a gt model most would reccomend that over the x700 pro.  </s>
<s> half life 2 i run into some issues with parts of the hud display being out of place if i use i think anything more than 2x anti-aliasing. the other one i can run without too much trouble.  </s>
<s> as far as perfornance goes, i run 1024x768 and there's only 1 spot in half life 2 where the graphics lag any and that's a spot where the game is having to render the sky as well as a swirling fan underwater.  </s>
<s> aside from that spot all the rendering is quite good and doesnt affect gameplay at all.  </s>
<s> have yet to try the game with hdr as i cant remember if that's a possible option in the game but in the small episode valve released to showcase it when it was on i had some studders in the display but we're talking very intensive graphics rendering here.  </s>
<s> sunlight reflecting off wet sand and off moist rocks those sorts of things... chaos theory i've also got at 1024x768 and occasionally when i've got night visions on it'll studder a bit.  </s>
<s> havent had any problems with halo as i dont think it's really pushing my hardware at all.  </s>
<s> as far as f.e.a.r goes you should have no problem playing it at the lower end of the graphical spectrum.  </s>
<s> the min requirements are well below your specs so you should be safe.  </s>
<s> it takes a 1.7 celron you're more or less 3ghz equiv sempron, 512ram you're 1024, 64 vid memory, you'd be 256 with an x700 pro.  </s>
<s> not sure aobut the sound but i would imagine any audigy 2 card would do the trick quite nicely  </s>
