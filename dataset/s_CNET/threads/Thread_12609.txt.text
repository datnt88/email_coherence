so i recently set up a netgear n router for my home and i am now experiencing problems with the wireless network. the main computer (gateway-windows xp)located in a different room and connected using a netgear wireless card seems to be receiving the signal fine at all times. however a new sony vaio laptop(windows vista), macbook pro as well as a dell inspiron laptop all (windows xp) seem to lose the ability to access the internet. the router shows connectivity to all of the laptops but the internet just does not seem to work. as for the main pc, the internet always seems to be working. any help or tips would be greatly apreciated...........
did you setup the netgear router like the b] forum sticky suggests? rick
i had a friend set up the router who is geek squad-ish but he must have screwed something up. whichpart of sticky b should i be looking at?
update the firmware in your wireless router. manufacturer's website, make & model needed. broadcast ssid(you may want to change this to make it easier to connect) use wpa-psk(tkip) security. most wireless devices work best with this type of security. mixed b and g mode(n if available) use channels 1, 6 or 11. most devices work better on these channels. save and exit. power everything off for 30 seconds. power everything back on, wait 30 seconds,now try to connect. rick
