(i get no alerts when i remove the memory and power on the machine. any ideas on good off-brand boards that would support the pentium-d 945? it needs to have the ability to control my two striped sata2 drives as well as my single sata2 hd (so i think that means i need 2 raid controllers right? i also want capabilities for 2 ati saphire radeon 512mb video cards. anyone? help?
