12458	0	55908	666015	nr	justbill	1/8/05 6:16 am	1.10516496e12	scsi scanner	i had a scsi scanner installed in my old computer but don't see a port i could use to plug it into on my new computer. my current computer is a dell model 4700 p-4 with win xp home operating system with 512 ram. is there any type adapter that would allow me to use a pci card slot for a scsi scanner? as you can see i'm not all that knowledgeable so if my question is ridiculous try not to laugh. thanks
