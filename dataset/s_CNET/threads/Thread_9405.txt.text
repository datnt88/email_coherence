can anyone help me to figure out why i cant burn music since ive downloaded wmp 10, and if i need to just add something to it to make it work, plzzz!
microsoft simply doesn't support all known cd recorders. your post didn't tell much about that drive or your system. bob
hi wmp wont recognise blank cds when trying to burn music. i also have real player which has the same problem can anyone help?
things to do (in this sequence): 1. look in device manager for any troubles with the cd-burner. if present, solve them. 2. download free cdburnerxp and see if you can burn with that program. 3. replace the drive for a functioning one. kees
i cant remember how to find device manager lol soz
ok found device manager but i really wouldnt know if theres a problem or not what would i be looking for? sorry am a beginner
i have installed cdburnerxp but that is having same problem wont recognise blank disc
cd/dvdrw drive failures are all too common. many spend months trying to avoid replacing an old drive but the lesson is clear to those that do this daily. swap the drive and re-test.
that, in fact, was point 3 of my list. kees
