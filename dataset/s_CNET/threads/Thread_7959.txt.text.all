<s> the manual on the s27c230b says i can adjust the brightness, but once it goes down, there is no &quot;up&quot; button.  </s>
<s> i chatted with samsung support, and they told me to use the + and - buttons.  </s>
<s> umm, there are no + and - buttons.  </s>
<s> so i am told that once i turned the brightness down, there is no way to turn it back up.  </s>
<s> i did a reset to &quot;factory settings&quot; but the brightness didn't budge.  </s>
<s> what is the trick to turn the brightness back up?  </s>
<s> on most newer monitors you have some access to get to the osd = on screen diags(menu) you then select brightness and use the +/- controls to set the level.  </s>
<s> depending on yours, that may mean left-right or up-down buttons.  </s>
<s> of course, there must be no actual damage to controls or brightness electronics themselves.  </s>
<s> if you had the brightness too long at high levels or simply accepted them &quot;as is&quot; which often is high it can burnout the electronics.  </s>
<s> samsung, gee everyone sooner or later has issues with that brand.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> this monitor does not have + and - buttons.  </s>
<s> there is only a &quot;down carat&quot; and no up.  </s>
<s> so once the brightness is turned down (following the manual), if i want to turn it back up, it isn't possible.  </s>
<s> or so the samsung support agent said.  </s>
<s> i find it incomprehensible that there would be a setting that can be lowered but not raised.  </s>
<s> if nothing else, at least re-flash the eeprom to its original full-on setting.  </s>
<s> i have always liked samsung products, and own quite a few.  </s>
<s> this has me really reconsidering.  </s>
<s> but how many buttons are there along the bottom.  </s>
<s> i wonder if there is indeed no up/down button but that magicbright osd issue.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> there are two buttons, menu and power, which doubles as down.  </s>
<s> i figured menu might double as up, but no, it does not.  </s>
<s> nor does a combination of both buttons create an up ... it's still down.  </s>
<s> by the time i figured that out, the intensity was at 66 percent.  </s>
<s> there has to be a way to reset the brightness to factory.  </s>
<s> i'm still looking.  </s>
<s> someone from samsung .. please weigh in.  </s>
<s> it's your company's reputation that's on the line.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy fyi - i have read the manual, be sure you haven't &quot;locked&quot; the controls.  </s>
<s> it seems 10secs.  </s>
<s> will lock/unlock them when pressed.  </s>
<s> thanks for the idea.  </s>
<s> i ensured that the controls aren't locked.  </s>
<s> still can't find how to raise the brightness.  </s>
<s> when you pull up the osd menu, there is a down arrow and a right arrow in the menu display.  </s>
<s> it's beyond counter-intuitive that samsung would say &quot;you can adjust the brightness&quot; and then not have an &quot;up&quot; button, or a button that can function as one.  </s>
<s> as noted there is a samsung forum and my company is not samsung so get in the right forum.  </s>
<s> i took the extra effort to check out the manuals and they were in my opinion too light.  </s>
<s> but why keep it?  </s>
<s> it's not suitable to your use and the seller and maker have not helped you.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> as i see it you need to goto the menu under samsung magic bright and select &quot;custom&quot; then set your levels. the others seem to be preset for best operation or so configured.  </s>
<s> if you can't under custom go up and down, then there's a fault as i see it.  </s>
<s> if there some save mode or exit that saves your custom setting, then be sure to do that.  </s>
<s> i don't see any other way around this for now.  </s>
<s> of course, as i stated before no real h/w fault be part of this nagging issue.  </s>
<s> manual page 36 section 3.1.1  </s>
<s> tada ------willy  </s>
<s> the magicbright reference seems to show more buttons than the op says it has.  </s>
<s> this one is back to the supplier and maker to correct the issue with showing them how to use it or replacing the product.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i believe i will return the monitor and purchase one from another manufacturer.  </s>
<s> thanks to all who replied.  </s>
