8146	2	278979	2673621	2673388	rob doane	1/8/08 5:55 am	1.1997717e12	yes	i did look through the others, but i couldn't find one that applied to my situation. haven't been able to find anything in my documentation either. i bought this computer knowing that the 6150se is not intended for high-end gaming. that's fine, because i don't play many games and when i do, they are usually not the graphic-intensive variety. it's just that occasionally i like to fire up a flight sim and am wondering if i can get a little bit better performance out of this computer. i assume that means a graphics card, but if there are other ways to do it, i'm all ears.

8146	6	278979	2673821	2673371	ramarc	1/8/08 9:43 am	1.19978538e12	choices	radeon 2600xt, $85:  geforce 8600gt, $104 (before $20 rebate):  either will work with your existing power supply.
