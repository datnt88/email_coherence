with dsd 150 already connected. are laptops still protected when away from the network. or how do i run a separate antivirus for the laptops when away from secure spot.
there was some that thought that while you were on a lan you didn't need av or firewalls. sadly this is not true with windows machines. -&gt; since such is free, why would we go without protection? bob
so then how do i run an antivirus software for a laptop when it is detatched from the safespot network at home.
tell us exactly why you think you have antivirus protection only when on your own network. you're the first poster i've ever seen make a claim the home network is a &quot;safespot.&quot; bob
this adapter i am talking about is a total network security device. its attatched between the modem and router. it secures the network. my network is a desktop two laptops and a itouch. i am wondering, if the laptops and or the itouch is used away from the s-link device, how do i run an antivirus on these portable computers.. if its possible. i am assuming i can: disable the antivirus when i'm connected to the network, and enable the antivirus when i'm away. is this posible,
note that: -&gt; the firewall protection is only applicable if the computers are connected to the internet through that device. otherwise, you're not protected. -&gt; the antivirus protection from mcafee must be installed on each computer. that will work even when your computers are not connected to that device. -&gt; you should never disable your antivirus protection, even when connected to that device. -&gt; you should always use a firewall...you need to install a software firewall for use when you're away from the d-link device. john
thats about what i thought. thanks. things are running great. this gagets pretty neat. seems to secure the home network. i'll keep antivirus running when i'm disconnected from the network. thanks.
