(i don't want to use a computer has a gateway.) i'd also like to make sure my wireless router (used for my laptop and other wireless devices) is kept on the 1st floor for easy access and better reception. so what combination of routers, hubs, switches, cable modem, etc do i need to wire my home? p.s. the wired devices i would like to connect are: 2 or more desktop computers, 2 networked hdhomerun dual tv tuners (potentially more), printers, game consoles, media center extenders, internet capable tvs potentially in the future, maybe a home server in the future, possibly more devices that have yet to be created at this time. thanks in advance for the help.
