i am trying to buy a new pc and wanted to know which is a better video card nvidia geforce 8300gs 128mb ati radeon hd 2400 pro 128mb which one of these is the best and give best picture. 
thanks very much 
i believe nvidia is currently slightly ahead of ati in the graphics department at the moment. 
i haven't seen the 8300 benchtested. 
toms hardware tested the hd2400 pro, and rank it a couple notches higher than the 8400 gs, and just a notch below the 8500 gt. they're both mid/low range graphics cards, good for basic use + light gaming.
