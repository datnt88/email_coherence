i have a friend that would like to use a dial-up connection over their wifi network, but i don't know how to do this. is it possible to share dial-up over any kind of network, but wifi specifically?
lets you do this. bob
actually, i answered my own question. just share the dial-up connection in the internet properties of the control panel. but thanks, though.
here is a link to a page where they may have the solution to your question. hope it helps!
