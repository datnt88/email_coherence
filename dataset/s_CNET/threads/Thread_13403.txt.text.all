smart: self-monitoring analysis, and reporting technology; built into many hard drives as a self-analytical tool for disk condition. 
how does one know if a given hard drive has smart built in? 
i know that's cheating but time and time again i just put the drive's model number into google and i find the answer in less than 5. bob 
...that i have to actually read something? 
thanks - i found the answers on google. 
it seems that neither of my hard drives have smart. 
if the drive has it and the status.
