<s> twice this week, my keyboard simply stopped inputting any characters--either in a browser or ms word document.  </s>
<s> after the first time, i looked in the device manager and the keyboard wasn't listed at all.  </s>
<s> i rebooted and everything was back to normal again--until just this evening.  </s>
<s> another reboot took care of this.  </s>
<s> but i'm wondering now why this is happening.  </s>
<s> i am using a dell inspiron 1501 (vista) and the drivers for this laptop on their support site don't have one for the keyboard.  </s>
<s> 1st off, since this is a laptop, it maybe better to post in the laptop forum, as more laptop users can help.  </s>
<s> a typical laptop is already provided its drivers for the system itself by the maker and/or the os. no separate driver should be required unless unique.  </s>
<s> what you may need to do, is either try a &quot;restore point&quot; when the problem didn't exist or a os repair.  </s>
<s> an os repair will make the required fixes by refreshing the os. this method shouldn't replace or delete your current pgms.  </s>
<s> etc. already loaded.  </s>
<s> it will however require access to the vista restore/recovery(oem) discs or from the hidden partition for same purpose.  </s>
<s> vendors and makers provide oem discs for some small cost or free(maybe?) if not shipped with system, contact them or website to order, it always good to have these discs &quot;in hand&quot;.  </s>
<s> review your manual or visit the maker support website in order how to access this process.  </s>
<s> as always, backup any critical data or use the maker's process to create a system recovery/restore disc.  </s>
<s> again visit the makers' support website for detailed info.  </s>
<s> i exclude any possible real h/w fault and this maybe a cause of your problem.  </s>
<s> only a kybd.  </s>
<s> replacement will fix it if nothing seems to work.  </s>
<s> if you have any warranty, use it or call service support to attempt fix.  </s>
<s> when asking for help provide all details of your system, etc. in order to better respond to your query.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> posted this in laptop forum.  </s>
<s> i can always do a repair install for this if i have to, i do have the disks.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i cross posted in the laptop troubleshooting forum.  </s>
