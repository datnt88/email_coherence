i have lenovo ideacentre k230 desktop. 
i have removed vista from that and installed windows xp sp3 on that. 
after that the camera is not working so what settings i have to make for that ??,and also cannot play any games on it... .please 
help me. 
since you can't find a camera driver at lenovo.co (i didn't look for you) just restore it to factory so it works again. 
locking it here.
