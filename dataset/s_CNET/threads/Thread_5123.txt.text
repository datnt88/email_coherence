hi im thinking about getting a server anyone have any thoughts? thanks mega-34
your question is really broad in scope. depending on what you need it to do, you may be able to use an older computer that you already own. tell us more about your goals.
for storing stuff and some online gaming. iv got $400 saved up for it. if i uae an old computer how do i turn that into a server?
sorry but there is little known here and 400 bucks is very slim for a server since 100 bucks is not much to ask for just the hard disk and not much is left. let's say we could use linux. here's a guide.  bob
