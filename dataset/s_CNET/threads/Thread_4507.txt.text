i am looking for the best/cheapest way to get the internet on my television. i have a ruko for streaming netflix etc, but i am wanting to be able to watch free videos such as on the network website or from the free tv websites. i would appreciate any help with this. thanks
and replaced it with the logitech revue. now shopping for the sony google tv. try one of those but these are not pcs. some folk are looking for the pc internet experience. for that you use a pc. bob
i have been looking at a lg bd360. i cannot determine if it will play other video like networks (abc, nbc etc) and free tv. it sounds to me like it will but do not want to purchase something that will not do what i want. i looked at your suggestions but doesn't sound like they will let me watch free tv from the web. i appreciate your response. thanks
all the free tv from the web is usually dead on bd players. unless you get one like the sony and it plays in the chrome browser. worth a try. i know i may get it. link to -&gt;  bob
