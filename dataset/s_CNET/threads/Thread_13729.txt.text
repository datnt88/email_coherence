i would like to ask you if it is possible to extent wifi range with one extra wifi router. i have one wifi router which is connected to dsl line with ip address 192.168.254.1 and its lan ip is set up to 192.168.2.1 and dhcp range from 192.168.2.2 to 192.168.2.30. mask is 255.255.255.0 in all cases. i have bought one additional router because the range of antenna was not satisfied and i need to extend the range around couple of meters. due to it was the most convenient solution for me. the first router is us 125bg and the second one is cnet cwr 854. all both of them are brand new router and operate perfect as stand alone. problem is in reconnection all of them. when i tried to connect them together via air they are not so communicative that why i am asking for you help. despite i have already researched all internet i did not find any proper diagram which can help me in my troubles. i hope that it is possible to use one additional router as an ap. the additional router had following configuration: lan: ip 192.168.2.40, mask 255.255.255.0, gw 192.168.2.40 wan only dhcp no any special configuration, perhaps nothing is connected to its wan port, wifi method is set up as wds+ap. if you require any specific information regarding this issue i am ready to support you. very many thank for your ideas and references, kind regards, martin.
but in short you can create a wider area if you use routers as access points or aps. this is the cnet discussion forum (nothing to do with cnet routers) so you are not on a cnet router support site. this is where people discuss things and help another. since you didn't give links to the manual i'll just note the usual method. bob
i hate it when the forum organizers answer a question. they want to inform you that you are posting in the wrong forum. soooooo annnoyyyyyinnnnngggg. i would slap you if i could.
since this is a member to member forum, answer the questions of the other members. there is some confusion about the cnet network products and this forum. a few members demanded support and after too many times of that, i have to make it clear this is not that forum. bob
is that this is cnet.com's forums, not to be confused with cnet usa, which is completely different company and we are not affiliated in anyway with them: cnet usa  cnet.com  i hope this clears things up. cheers! -lee
