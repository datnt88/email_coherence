does anybody know if they are any coupons for the dell se198wfp? it's a pretty cheap monitor as is (plan to buy it anyway), but i was wondering if anyone had any dell.com coupons to knock another 10% off. i scoured for some on google for awhile but had no luck, although i did find when this monitor was originally released, it was $189 vs. $199 it is now. anywho, any help is appreciated. i wouldn't mind saving a buck or two (which is why i'm getting this monitor in the first place).
try here:  i didn't see one for that particular model, but there were some for others.
yeah, it's not there, but thanks for the link. i'll use that site in the future (good layout compared to the other coupons sites i've seen).
well dell just dropped the price today of that monitor by $10 bucks and it turns out they have no price guarentee. i should have waited ten more days to order. oh well, but if there's anyone out there wanting to get it for cheaper, now's your chance. the sale lasts until oct 4th. at least i didnt lose as much as the iphone guys.
try here.  here you an find coupon and discount codes.
