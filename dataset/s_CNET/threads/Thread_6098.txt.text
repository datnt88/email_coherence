i have a dell dimension 4600 and i wanted to overclock my p4 2.66ghz cpu just to get a little more use out of it before i eventually buy a new pc. i was wondering, is it safe to use an overclocking utility to overclock my cpu if my bios doesn't let me overclock it? specs: p4 2.66ghz dell a07 bios intel i865p motherboard radeon x1600 pro gpu 1.5gb ram
some of the windows based oc utilities will also overclock the graphics and hard disk i/o channels (they usually warn about this). an oc'd hard disk can become corrupted very easily and the graphics may wig out. be sure you know the risks and can live with the possible consequences before proceeding.
same risk for oc as with bios.
anyone know of a good cpu overclocking utility?
