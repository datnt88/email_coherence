i am in the process of building a computer and don't know what graphics card to get. i will not be doing any gaming but i do plan on doing video editing, photo editing using adobe cs 3 and quite possible using dual monitors.

link about it.  i like a lot about that. i could skip the ssd and change the gpu to what i noted above.
do you know if the integrated graphics on the haswell is much better than the one on intel's dz77ga-70k with core i7-3770, which is the one that i have been contemplating buying. if not then i might be better of buying 2 of these: gigabyte gv-n760oc-2gd rev2.0 geforce gtx 760 2gb 256-bit gddr5 pci express 3.0 hdcp ready windforce 3x 450w video card. as long as i can keep the price of my mobo, cpu, and graphics whether integrated or not at no more than $1000.
just get the models listed and you'll have a great all round machine. you could drop the ssd and boost the gpu but all your choice. also you could go without any gpu and install later.  puts it on par with the usual low end 720 cards. bob
i have decided to go without the gpu and see how things work. actually, i won't be doing much if any video editing until sometime next year. in your previous post you mentioned the haswell and i have been giving that very serious thought along with an asus mobo (because it supports dual monitors) and now i am investigating a psu that will be compatible with the haswell which as i understand it needs a psu that can work with a very low voltage when the cpu is in &quot;sleep mode&quot;.
