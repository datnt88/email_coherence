hello all just wondering whether anyone could recommend a decent 2.1 speaker system or even a real good 2.0 system for my computer - not an expert in this field so any advice would be well appreciated! some other info: * i use my pc (ms vista o/s) for watching films as well as listening to music - no games! * it will be in a small-medium sized room so don't want too many wires, and don't want a huge system as have enough clutter as it is! * budget - less than 100. * i did like the harman kardon soundsticks, and was originally going to go with them (from the great reviews i have read, as well as a great design) but decided against it as i read it does not have a switch to turn it off (waste of electricity - lol) and dont want it to glow whilst i am trying to sleep - need darkness!!! * a speaker system which is great value and will hopefully last a few years!!! and advice/recs/help of any sort will be very well appreciated! thanks in advance! t.
logitech or altec, either one. several variations and would work well.
hi phil and thanks for your response! am now looking into the logitech range - something half decent and maybe even half the price of the soundsticks. does anyone have any reccs? what are people experiences of the z-4s? thanks in advance!
logitech z4 very good! they should be within your range and those are one of the specific models that i had in mind.
