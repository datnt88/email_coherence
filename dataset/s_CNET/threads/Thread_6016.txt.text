hello, i want to change the ssid on all my aps without it affecting the connected devices. the users should possible not be affected with the connecttion to the wifi network. how can i go about it?
since changing the ssid drops the network connection you can't push out a change to the machines. let's say no. bob
if you actually change it you will drop. some commercial ap have the ability to add multiple ssid to the same vlan. you could then run in parallel for a while and tell your uses to use the new one and then remove the old. a couple of brands of ap actually have a feature that allows you to not allow new sessions to a ssid but leave it active.
if and that's a big if i could have multiple ssid i could have my it staff push out the change to the new ssid and when enough time has passed (months?) then we could drop the old ssid. great idea. bob
