6738	2	271727	2629033	2629050	elks78	11/13/07 2:55 pm	1.1949657e12	re: the 327w i run into	i checked the sticky, but the westell website offers no firmware updates. and my security is just fine. i was wondering about the qos settings and how to use them and i'm not sure xbox live is p2p.

6738	4	271727	2629080	2629058	elks78	11/13/07 3:00 pm	1.194966e12	digging for firmware	yes i'm using the forum advice (thanks guys) and while i want to dig for it, im not sure i want to be installing firmware from a random website that isn't westell's official one

6738	8	271727	2629155	2629000	r. proffitt	11/13/07 4:22 pm	1.19497092e12	recap.	here's what i know. you have the 327w, version 6. &quot;d90-327w61-06&quot; which is one westell has not leaked a firmware update. i have no indication you have followed our suggested settings so i'll just reiterate that. the forum note/sticky is exactly what i found to work very well on all the 327w's i've run into. if you don't use those settings, please share what they are since it matters. the other settings have never paid off so i'll write to use the stock values. you can try drtcp from  but after too many trials i have returned to what we have in the forum note and stock settings. if you are using wep then you are repeating an issue i run into a lock. if you have hidden ssid, then you are repeating another issue. -&gt; i'm going to be blunt here. if you don't share, i can't share other than to repeat the forum sticky without noting why we do that. bob

6738	10	271727	2629330	2629171	r. proffitt	11/13/07 8:19 pm	1.19498514e12	i'm unsure why the details are not shared.	i've worked on many 327w's and stock the xbox live is fine, unless we find the owner with wep, disabled ssid, etc... bob
6738	11	271727	2629737	2629330	elks78	11/14/07 12:39 pm	1.19504394e12	actually	your dead wrong there. all details were shared. numerous times in fact. but your too stubborn to listen. you probably thought you had my problem pre-solved. sorry buddy can't be right all the time! as a matter of fact, it was a simple issue of enable port fowarding to s pre-defined service under the router settings. this helps with xbox live speed. also after calling my isp for actual help, they realized that our dsl modem was not up to speed and have them send a technician out to fix that problem. but thanks for your senseless paranoia about me &quot;hiding&quot; things from you like i actually had something to hide
6738	12	271727	2629757	2629737	r. proffitt	11/14/07 12:55 pm	1.1950449e12	and i see i was right as well.	it was never the settings you were asking about. it's a shame you feel slighted by someone that offered to share prior experiences. sorry, i'm just a grizzled well seasoned embedded hardware and software type. i can see why that could annoy you that i want to work my list first. too bad you misdirected the discussion with talk of qos which it never was an issue. bob
6738	13	271727	2629760	2629757	elks78	11/14/07 12:58 pm	1.19504508e12	so what your saying is	all of this could have been avoided by you explaining yourself and saying what your thoughts were rather than talking to me like im retarded? just simply stating that you believed qos was not the thing i should be looking at? thats all you had to do? please never go into customer support or anything having to do with pr
6738	14	271727	2629765	2629760	r. proffitt	11/14/07 1:15 pm	1.1950461e12	and more.	i am more than willing to go over the usual areas and help people set these up. this is not tech support so i have no qualms or reservations as to pr or such here. it's up to everyone to get along and work the issues. it was never qos and has never been in many years of my helping setup these things. again your choice on direction and keep in mind this is not tech support. bob
