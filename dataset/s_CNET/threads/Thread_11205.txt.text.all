<s> without switching out my mobo, im looking to get the most out of the upgrade potential for my current socket 939 system.  </s>
<s> by the middle of next year, i will build a new system around an amd am2 board or intel core duo cpu, but i dont want to jump into that until then.  </s>
<s> in the meantime, again, im looking to figure out the best upgrade options for my current system.  </s>
<s> my main priority is to get the most gaming potential from my current system as possible: i play bf2, cod/cod2, oblivion, red orchestra, day of defeat mostly fps games.  </s>
<s> for my job i also multi-task quite a bit with internet browsers and the office suite (i dont really do any dvd/cd burning or anything like that).  </s>
<s> with the fall of the amd 64 x2 prices, my immediate reaction was to grab a 3800+ x2 (or higher) and another gig of ram.  </s>
<s> however, im unsure about the performance gain ill get from the new cpu and ive heard that if i fill up all four of my memory slots that my system will only run my ram at 333 rather than 400 (is this true).  </s>
<s> so, im wondering if i can get a significant performance gain by 1.  </s>
<s> and see what that shows about the cpu options and their performance with ganes and other apps.  </s>
<s> 2gbs ddr400 is fairly cheap if the games in question load and run faster with 2gb vs 1 gb. the other thing is there are some 'transition' mb ..like the one from asrock vsta (see review at anandtech.com) that allows you to run a conroe with ddr, ddr2, agp or pcie.  </s>
<s> and it's very modestly priced.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> hello, i just upgraded from a 3000+ to a 4000+ & it is a substantial improvement.  </s>
<s> it's like a new computer.  </s>
<s> not that it wasn't fast before, it's just noticeably faster now.  </s>
<s> i got the san diego core from newegg for 135.  </s>
<s> 2.4ghz tooling along at 2.7ghz & it's not even breaking a sweat.  </s>
<s> i didn't opt for a dual-core.  </s>
<s> i just don't think there are enough applications out there to support it yet.  </s>
<s> i believe multicore is the way of the future, but the benefits don't justify the cost, at this time.  </s>
<s> your memory is fine, for now.  </s>
<s> take the extra money & put it towards a new video card.  </s>
<s> you can use a video card in your next pc.  </s>
<s> look into the 7600gt, 7900gt or a x1900xt.  </s>
<s> my pc games like never before.  </s>
<s> enjoy!  </s>
<s> athlon 64 x2 4200+, $199 inc.  </s>
<s> shipping (zipzoomfly) radeon x1900gt, $202 inc.  </s>
<s> shipping (newegg) if you prefer nvidia, an xfx 7900gt is $240 inc.  </s>
<s> shipping after rebate now.  </s>
<s> if you wait a week or two, the 7950gt will be out and the 7900gt should drop to $210 or lower.  </s>
<s> both the x1900gt and 7900gt will be faster than dual 7600gt.  </s>
<s> it should come back in stock soon.  </s>
<s> if you don't want to wait, then that x1900gt is good; this x1800xt is a little better:  </s>
