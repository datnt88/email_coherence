<s> what is the fastest cpu on the market (that anyone can buy fairly easily).  </s>
<s> also what is the fastest prosessor for the g5, pentium and amd?  </s>
<s> i am not so educated on the g5. however, the fastest processor for amd is the fx-55 and its specs are 2600/1024/htt.  </s>
<s> and the fastest for intel is the pentium 4 570j and its specs are 3800/1024/800.  </s>
<s> as christmas nears, intel will release a new p4ee and we will retake the market.  </s>
<s> that p4ee will be the fastest and its specs will be 3733/2048/1066 making for a speed daemon processor.  </s>
<s> the fastest cpu cannot run on a table all by itself.  </s>
<s> manufacturers of mbs must be in on it too (and ram manufactures also). the availability of the whole package is as important as it is for a single component.  </s>
<s> these new babies tend to be pricy and tempramental.  </s>
<s> athlon 64 fx-55.  </s>
<s> the fastest chip on the market to day would have to be the amd athlon 64 fx55.  </s>
<s> it isn't as versatile as the intel p4ee 3.6ghz chip but it wins hands down in every other category.  </s>
<s> the lack of ddr2 however, keeps me away from the amd chip for now.  </s>
<s> but the boards are coming.  </s>
<s> g5? i have no idea, i don't work with macs, sorry.  </s>
<s> -mike  </s>
<s> which of these processors is the fastest for continuous maths calculations, used in programs that may take many hours to complete the calculations.  </s>
<s> fastest cpu is amd fx-55.  </s>
<s> intel suks now especially with the expensive price and less performance.  </s>
<s> the amd fx-55 is faster, but you probably have to be a spoiled rich kid, or make a pretty good wage, to buy the fx-55 from $816-$840 (processor alone - newegg).  </s>
<s> now the fastest cpu is the intel core 2 quad q8650.  </s>
<s> i might have spelled it wrong but anyways it is the fastest as of 08/26/07.  </s>
<s> damn i got orientation for school tomorrow  </s>
