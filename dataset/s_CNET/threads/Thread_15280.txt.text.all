<s> not to be belittle you, but to ask about os and service pack, suggest you're a novice.  </s>

<s> os = operating system service pack = os updates issued by bundle or large releases if you use xp, then the most latest service pack is #, thus sp3.  </s>
<s> check the control panel under device manager and under the typical 1st display will show the version you're running.  </s>
<s> as for finding out anything else about your pc, i suggest you get the pgm., called pcwizard 2010 or 2011 and download it and use.  </s>
<s> its free and reports alot about your pc. as already stated to you the realtek audio comes in various versions, so it makes sense tyo get the right one.  </s>
