can anyone please help me do network of win98 and mandrake? can it be done? thanks a bunch!
help me please =(
you didn't describe what said network would offer. if i connected the machines, bam! i have a network. that's done and done but you never told what the network needed to do. as such the discussion stalled. bob
hmm.. i need to share internet connections from the two.. ty for the reply
you wrote &quot;i need to share internet connections from the two..&quot; this is far too vague to begin. but here's an idea. get a router, connect it as they show in the supplied documentation and bam, you get shared internet access for machines connected to the router. bob
