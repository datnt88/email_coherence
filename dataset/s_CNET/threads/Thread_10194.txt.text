the question is pretty self-explanatory. i'd like to know if there is a difference between what is considered &quot;shared memory&quot; and what is considered &quot;shared video memory&quot;. thanks in advance.
depends on the what you mean with shared memory. shared between what? can you provide a link where it's used in the sense you mean? kees
if you don't have actual &quot;dedicated memory&quot; on some device, then whatever device(usually video) is using system memory for it needs. it will use what it needs or expands on what it already has. no matter any &quot;shared&quot; memory from actual system memory installed gets used. if you increase system memory, do so it usually does better qand if shared presents a larger memory resource. don't confuse the term &quot;memory&quot; for a stored media device which in turn gets used as memory as well. this is generally speaking some type of &quot;virtual memory&quot; on a temporary basis. however, as already asked of you, in what way has the terms shared and shared video come to light? tada -----willy
