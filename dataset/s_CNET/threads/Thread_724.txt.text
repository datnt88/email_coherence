hello, i'm having a little harware problem with my computer. everything was fine last week, and then my interent got blocked for a few days. after it was working again, i couldn't get my mouse and keyboard working toegther. both are fine. if i restsrt my compouter, and i press the delete key it will go into the bios at that point. however if the computer then loads up, neither the mouse nor teh keyboard will work. if i restart the computer once i pass the sccreen which checks to see if the keyboard is present, if i unplug it then the mouse works perfectly so i know there's no prob with the mouse. since i can press f1 at the start up screen, i know that there is no problem with my keyboard. but when both are plugged in, neither works when windows loads. can anyone help? thanks, dan p.s. sorry about the awkwardness of this typing. since my keyboard is not working my brother is typing this on msn and i am copying/pasting it here
usb or ps/2? wired or wireless?
it's ps/2, and wired.
