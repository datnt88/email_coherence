<s> last i looked i couldn't find one.  </s>
<s> and i would like to find one that works with avast av (64 bit).  </s>
<s> zone alarm does not operate with xp64 and has no code project going that i know of for 64 bit os. i already have a router (gigafast ee420-r build may 2003) with a general firewall &quot;enable&quot; switch and ip, mac (outgoing) and domain(incoming) filtering the router does not log or warn of incoming pings and such - that i might put on a list to obstruct.  </s>
<s> it does have an &quot;ignore&quot; ping switch which i have enabled.  </s>
<s> but i would like something in place with more, broader, automatic intelligence.. and protect traffic in both directions. the manual does not explain what the general firewall switch does (or does not do). the product and the company are defunct.  </s>
<s> does it now have the outgoing monitoring now?  </s>
<s> if not, what about jetico?  </s>
<s> was that free?  </s>
<s> i'm using comodo on 64 bit xp. quite satisfactory...  </s>
