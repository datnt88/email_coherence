<s> i was hoping someone could give me some insight on this situation.  </s>
<s> i am somewhat ignorant on these matters!  </s>
<s> i had an external hard drive which i accidentally left running when i left town for three weeks.  </s>
<s> when i got back it was making a clicking sound and was slow to access information.  </s>
<s> i immediately bought a second hard drive and began backing up my data.  </s>
<s> early in the process my computer crashed, and upon rebooting my drive was no longer accessible.  </s>
<s> all the data that was previously transferred up until this point operated just fine.  </s>
<s> i paid to have the data recovered and they were able to bring back everything i had lost.  </s>
<s> according to the techs, they did a &quot;raw data recovery&quot; which would bring back everything exactly as it was up until my drive failure.  </s>
<s> although everything was recovered and transferred to a second drive, none of the files operate.  </s>
<s> omfi files are unrecognized by avid, quicktimes suggest corruption, and audio files simply do nothing when launched.  </s>
<s> my questions are: is it typical for a failing drive to corrupt every file it contains immediately before it dies? is there any thing i might be able to do at this point, or should i give up on ever recovering this data?  </s>
<s> thank you!  </s>
<s> ive had my external drives crash on me a few times in the past, and ive been able to get all me data back successfully (luckily) i use runtime get data back ( ). it comes in two version, for fat and ntfs partitions. the free trial version allows you to search your hard drive for lost files, and open the files/folders it finds, however it does not allow you to recover them, for that you need the full version.  </s>
<s> i have never had all my files corrupted when my drives fail and i have never heard of it either.  </s>
<s> hope this helps  </s>
<s> i checked out that link and runtime software actually doesn't recommend their product for use with drives that have physical problems.  </s>
<s> they site drives that make strange noises and stop spinning as an example, so i suppose this applies to me.  </s>
<s> i've already spent $200 dollars to have the data recovered, it just seems to be corrupt now.  </s>
<s> i'm wondering if i have any options at this point.  </s>
<s> thanks for the tip though  </s>
<s> even though the runtime software site advises against using their product for physically damaged drives, i thought what the heck?  </s>
<s> i've got nothing to lose! it worked like a charm!  </s>
<s> i was able to restore all of my files and they operate just fine!  </s>
<s> i wish i had know about this from the beginning instead of using that rip-off data recovery place.  </s>
<s> thanks again!  </s>
