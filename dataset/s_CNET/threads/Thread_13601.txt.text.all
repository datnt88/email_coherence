<s> hey cnet, i ran a diagnostic test on my laptop because it was having some problems, and it found these errors on the hard drive: error code 0f00:1a44 and 0f00:0244 does this mean that my hard drive needs to be replaced?  </s>
<s> or can i reformat it and it'll be ok? it still boots up so i can try to salvage some of my files.  </s>
<s> it's 320g, only about a year old.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> you always do that first.  </s>
<s> your choice to try the format and re-use.  </s>
<s> i don't need unreliable parts in my machines.  </s>
<s> i tend to gift them away.  </s>
<s> why gift?  </s>
<s> so there is no doubt that i find the parts to be worthless.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yeah, right now i'm running a chkdsk and probably going out to invest in a portable harddrive.  </s>
<s> gonna throw my files onto that and then reformat...hopefully the drive isn't physically damaged.  </s>
