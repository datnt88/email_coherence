i am running win-xp he os. my internet gateway is listed as &quot;disabled&quot;. how do i enable it? thanks, ray savage
unless you are the host for ics (internet connection sharing), then you leave it be. bob
right click and choose to enable, if you are using this machine as the gateway as rp suggested.
