<s> hi everyone, newbie here.  </s>
<s> i'd like to get a wireless webcam so i don't have to have my computer on all the time to have the cam running.  </s>
<s> if i get a wireless webcam can i view a stream of what is going on in my house from somewhere else or do i need to have server space somewhere else first?  </s>
<s> i'm leaving on a vacation soon so i'd like to set one up asap if possible.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> go to a local box store, best buy, etc. and tell them what you have in mind, they sell kits that should meet your purpose.  </s>
<s> there can be issues with wireless set ups, proximity to router, etc. so before you do this, get a bit of advice on what is best to use for your application.  </s>
<s> thanks very much, i'll try that!  </s>
<s> let me lead with just one.  </s>
<s> it's not a bad unit but you are going to be ready to learn a bit about networking.  </s>
<s> if any maker tells you &quot;nothing for you to learn about this&quot; they lied.  </s>
<s> it's not hard stuff but what you want is out there and about this price.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
