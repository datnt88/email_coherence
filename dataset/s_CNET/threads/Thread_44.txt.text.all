<s> well i read this review: and went ahead and got the computer.  </s>
<s> now i need to know how to add a hard drive.  </s>
<s> does anyone know if the gateway comes with everything you need to add one?  </s>
<s> i can't really remove anything from the old computer (vaio), and might need a cable or something.  </s>
<s> most new systems use sata type connections, thus ports.  </s>
<s> in this regard, buy a new hd and allowing that space is available to mount it internally, it should be relatively easy.  </s>
<s> when you buy the new hd, visit or review its manual online or physically to check out it wants to be installed.  </s>
<s> again, providing there is a space to mount the hd, proceed.  </s>
<s> also, new hd should have included the required s/w for optional or ease of install as well.  </s>
<s> if not, then visit the hd makers support website for such.  </s>
<s> gateway may provide info/details on access to &quot;replace a hd&quot; but that same info/details is required to mount a new/additional hd. once installed physically access it or prepare it for use by formatting, etc., using the hd management setup.  </s>
<s> beware, to know exactly which hd you format.  </s>
<s> if you like, before any of this is done, back-up the system or use the maker's own s/w to produce recovery media if not already supplied.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> it sounds to me the person is looking for a solution for getting the info from the old computer to the new.  </s>
<s> the title is a bit misleading to me too.  </s>
<s> no reference to an old hd or new for that matter, directly. the link provided offers nothing but the gateway specs/details. the info i provided will work for a new as well as old hd if sata.  </s>
<s> if not, then a pata or older eide connection, then an adapter such as a ada-2020 found at or similar will suffice.  </s>
<s> if an eide port is available then quite possible the adapter isn't needed.  </s>
<s> but, until the original poster offers any more details of the old system besides a &quot;sony viao&quot; could proceed more.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> well it doesn't have any ide slots, at least not that i can see.  </s>
<s> so i guess i need an adapter now?  </s>
<s> and that the current hard drive, which you can see, is connected with sata?  </s>
<s> from a quick google search i found these: i'm assuming something along those lines would be adequate.  </s>
<s> of course i don't want to buy an adapter and find out it's the wrong kind.  </s>
<s> if so, you network them and transfer what you need that way.  </s>
<s> and just a hint.  </s>
<s> when folks use those tiny dots in a post title, it's not all that easy to click on them.  </s>
<s> a few letters of text makes a nice target.  </s>
<s> ah, i guess you aren't using threaded view.  </s>
<s> every reply to me is shown on the same page.  </s>
<s> no, the old pc doesn't work.  </s>
<s> i ended up just getting an enclosure for the old drive.  </s>
<s> now the next hard part is transferring my old bookmarks and data...  </s>
