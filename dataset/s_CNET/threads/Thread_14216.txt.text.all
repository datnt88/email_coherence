<s> i have a virgin superhub downstairs with my tv and xbox attached.  </s>
<s> i also have a dg834g router upstairs with a bt connection with two pcs and connected.  </s>
<s> i want to use the netgear router to extend the reange of the super hub so that i only have 1 network in the house as the range of the superhub is not good enough.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> i have tried to set the netgear as an extender but cannot get it to work.  </s>
<s> sorry but no step by step is available.  </s>
<s> only guides.  </s>
<s> many over at this will make it look as if there is one network.  </s>

<s> i don't want to connect a cable between the routers as its not an easy route.  </s>
<s> can they be connected wirelessly?  </s>
<s> i often use a powerline bridge to make that last link.  </s>
<s> most routers are capable of configuring wds.  </s>
<s> this allows the two routers to communicate with each other and still support your wireless devices.  </s>
<s> you should refer to your owner manuals to see if you have this option.  </s>
<s> wds has it's downsides though.  </s>
<s> you cut your throughput in half and the connection is not always the most stable.  </s>
<s> keep this in mind.  </s>
<s> i recently bought a netgear wn2000rpt unit within 5 minutes the extender was up and running and a strong-excellent signal across the first floor of our house.  </s>
<s> if you want to use an old netgear router, i have also tried this in the past and took it wired into another part of the house; not as flexible though as the above wireless unit.  </s>
<s> hope this is helpful.  </s>
