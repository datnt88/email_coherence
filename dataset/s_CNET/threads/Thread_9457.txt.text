i'm a teacher and need to be able to use a keyboard while presenting information on the projector. sitting at a desk is stupid and impractical for me (i've got middle schoolers, folks!), and i was wondering what the effective range for wireless keyboards are. more than likely i would go for a usb, but if a bluetooth has better range (which common sense is telling it would), i could go that route. thank you for any and all input! regards, darren aho
i need a minimum of 30 feet of range, but the more the better!
30ft is about the maximum range usually stated by rf wireless keyboards (my own logitech can easily beat 20ft, and through walls!). mice rf range is far less (mine begins to get lost in the maze at about 8ft) though. the main problem here is that bluetooth range isn't any better with an effective range of....wait for it...32ft which maybe means a careful and extended central position for the receiver would be required for either (oh, the logicalness of it all! ; ) so you could walk around it, without going near either of the effective limits. geebee.
that's good news! thank you
