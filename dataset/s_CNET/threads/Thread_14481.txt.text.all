<s> about 18 months ago (i lost a year being in iraq) my windows xp me home os crashed on my laptop.  </s>
<s> i got a new hd (since sony has no recover program other than wiping the whole hd) reloaded the drivers and os and then tried to access my old hd using a stand alone sata portable hd case (rocketfish).  </s>
<s> problem: i can see the folders, and even access down a level but when i tried to open/copy/move a folder/file it locks up.  </s>
<s> i had tried copying through the cmd.exe interface and it can list the directories, but when you ask it to copy it states it can't find it.  </s>
<s> does anyone know how i can get data off my old hd? thanks in advance!  </s>

<s> google xp take ownership if you forgot how.  </s>
<s> as soon as i click on something it just locks up - i have another hd from an old computer that i have to take ownership of - that's just no the case for this hd. i do think it may have something to do with the registry - the program from ms that addresses &quot;file not found&quot; registry errors cannot be selected for an external hd which this is - any suggestions?  </s>
<s> thanks in advanced- matt  </s>
<s> read  </s>
<s> have you tried another pc and check results?  </s>
<s> if you can, try ubuntu live linux version and see if you can copy that way or burn to disc.  </s>

<s> i have tried another pc - but have not tried ubuntu - i will try that next.  </s>
<s> thanks- matt  </s>
