i've got an emachine t5026 with this integrated setup. it says it supports pixel shaders 2.0, but when i try to run my 7 year old's &quot;lego star wars&quot; it won't run and gives me a mesage that it requires pixel shaders 1.1. i understand this intel gma is not a gamers setup, but &^*$@ why won't it run? i have installed the latest drivers...
it's telling you to fade back to 1.1. this is not unusual. and life goes on... jack
&lt;&lt;it's telling you to fade back to 1.1. this is not unusual.&gt;&gt; where are the controls to set it back to 1.1? i have the same problem. thanks.
