<s> hi i use win 7 os and it is 1 yr old dell optiplex 780 desktop.  </s>
<s> i had no issue when it was new to put the machine in hybernation, now it does not go into the hybernation mode! also it does not recognize the external hd ... i cant backup my data files no problem with the usb it recognizes it so no problem with the usb port.  </s>
<s> if some one has any suggestion what is causing this issue thank you pat  </s>
<s> the machine recognizes the hd control panel under the search devices .. but when i go the computer to look for the device it is not there.  </s>
<s> unable to back up my files.  </s>
<s> in the task bar it has the icon to safely remove the hardware.  </s>
<s> i use that before removing the hd. i also checked the drivers and the it indicates that drivers are up to date.  </s>
<s> thank you for your help.  </s>
<s> pat  </s>
<s> you could try doing a restoration to an earlier time to see if something might have changed within the system, doing this will not delete or remove anything, it is not the same as a full restore/recovery.  </s>
<s> unless you have tried this already, i'd give it a shot.  </s>
<s> thank you issue.  </s>
<s> i will try that and see what happens.  </s>
<s> ofcourse over the months i have added some software like ccleaner, spyaweeper, defrag and advancedcare.  </s>
<s> i am aware that sometimes some software cause issues .. but not recognize the hd was a new one for me.  </s>
<s> as i indicated earlier external usb are recognized.  </s>
<s> i connect this hd to an older computer running window xp and it recognizes the hd. so it seems that some setting in this new dell machine does not allow the hd recognition.  </s>
<s> thank you so much for your suggestion.  </s>
<s> pat  </s>
<s> i also wanted to provide this info: on devices and printers i see the external hd. i check the properties of this hd and check the device status and it says that device is working properly.  </s>
<s> is there anything else i can check to see what is causing this external hd not to be recognized.  </s>
<s> thank you pat  </s>
