<s> hi guys, i'm looking into buying a new wireless-n router.  </s>
<s> linksys or netgear?  </s>
<s> anyone experience either one of these makers?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> netgear is what i have it has wpa security.  </s>
<s> that's what you need for your router to be secure.  </s>
<s> i'm sure the other one has wpa security.  </s>
<s> just remember to update the firmware for your router, since most come shipped with outdated firmware.  </s>

<s> some of the firewall options are better in the linksys.  </s>
<s> example?  </s>
<s> block an ip range.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i just switched from a linksys wireless g router to a dlink extreme wireless n router - dir 655. the difference is night and day.  </s>
<s> now the kids play their online games and the internet works perfectly.  </s>
<s> no one complains of slow load times.  </s>
<s> i had to many issues with the linksys.  </s>
<s> set up with the dlink was a breeze.  </s>
<s> consider this one another option.  </s>
