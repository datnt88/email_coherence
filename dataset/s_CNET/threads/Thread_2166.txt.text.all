<s> i have a silly question.  </s>
<s> i have a hp laptop, cost me a little over 2 grand.  </s>
<s> it has wireless built in, but i've been told by a friend that i could get better wireless with an orinoco pc wireless card.  </s>
<s> my question is, can i still use this pc card if i already have wireless built in.  </s>
<s> wouldn't it mess things up a bit?  </s>
<s> thank you all.  </s>
<s> geoff.  </s>
<s> the orinco is a nice card but my cheapo acer is connecting 2 houses down the block to my wpnt834 just fine.  </s>
<s> why would i need to do better than that?  </s>

<s> 1.) the laptop has a better antenna, it's built around the perimeter of the screen.  </s>
<s> how big could the pc card antenna be?  </s>
<s> 2.) better as compared to what?  </s>
<s> wireless b, g, and n have limits that cannot be surpassed.  </s>
<s> 3.) go ahead and buy it and try it but make sure you can return it if (when) you don't see any difference.  </s>
