network cable is unplug but internet is working in windows server 2008 what is the solution
i do not have server 2008 but in other versions you can turn off the notification. why fix that or spend any time at all on this since it's working! bob
could there be 2 network cards and so one isn't plugged but the other one is? is there a wireless network card being used?
hmmm... there's got to be a wireless card somewhere.
