when i start up my pc i keep receiving a warning that there is a smart error on my hard drive-back up my data and replace my hard drive as soon as possible. i try to run a scan disk but, it keeps restarting because something keeps writing to the disc. how do i find out what keeps writing to the disc and how then can i stop it? thanks for your help. brian.
the s.m.a.r.t. feature is telling you that something is going on with the drive. it could be some bad sector that its spared out, or the tracks are failing ecc too much or some other inside information is failing that scandisk will never tell you. if you don't save what you need on cdr or other now and lose it all, do not complain it didn't warn you. as to the scandisk issue. type scandisk 10 times (those three words) into google.com to find the microsoft article about this issue. start shopping for a new hard disk today. bob
