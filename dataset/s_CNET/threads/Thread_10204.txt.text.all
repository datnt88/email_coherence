<s> ok im trying to decide , should i get the bb playbook or toshiba thrive ?  </s>
<s> i am just so conflicted because i like the bbpb os but there is just not that much support and i dont know if i could even count on it getting like flash updates and os updates.  </s>
<s> but on the other hand there is the thrive which i like and is the safe choice but is kinda bulky and i hear its kinda lagy with flash, but idk what do u think?  </s>
<s> look at the apple/microsoft eco-system and you have your answer.  </s>
<s> some can't see it, some won't accept it.  </s>
<s> for now it appears to be 2 choices and the bb is a nice try but rim upset the developers so for third and maybe fourth place they really needed to try harder.  </s>
<s> but something in their dna or culture interfered.  </s>
<s> unless the bb is 99 bucks, i'd ignore it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> we own three tablets.  </s>
<s> they are three different os' (android/ios/webos) if you want android take a look at the asus transformer or samsung galaxy 10.1 (or their other sizes) i am not even sure if rim is going to continue on with the playbook, and the thrive is a little too unpolished.  </s>
<s> hi, both the laptops you have mentioned are not up to the market. the one leading in the market is apple ipad 2. then next comes the samsung galaxy tab.  </s>
<s> good to know how did you narrow choice to these two particular tablets.  </s>
<s> i guess it was form factor, many people think that 10 inches too big for tablet purpose.  </s>
<s> and i have to agree here.  </s>
<s> however 7 inches tablet niche is wide, you can check also amazon fire and sumsung galaxy 7.7.  </s>
<s> but returning back to your question playbook is currently $300, but it doesn't have external sd slot thrive will be available in december most likely for $450 and hard to buy, however i would strongly consider it, because better screen and sd card slot.  </s>
<s> you should pick the unit that you are most comfortable with.  </s>
<s> though if you want a device that can play flash, don't get an ipad.  </s>
<s> flash won't work on the ipad.  </s>
<s> i also heard the android os is pretty efficient, you could check out those android ones.  </s>
