<s> good day, i know laugh at the newbiee.. however i have the following system on order and am waiting for it to arrive.  </s>
<s> emachines t6524 amd athlon 64 3500+ 2.2ghz / 1gb ddr / 200gb hdd / dual layer dvdrw/ integrated ati radeon xpress 200 / flash media reader / windows xp media center 2005 /. now all that looks real pretty to me being a novice and upgrading from an hp pavilion v70s running the windows xp home edtion.  </s>
<s> i also have an xbox 360 and am wating to see how the two inter-react with each other.  </s>
<s> i have discovered cnet and am looking for a breakdown of the specs as to what it is, what it does and and how to upgrade if possible.  </s>
<s> i have been bouncing around seeking information.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> ok, so let's break down what you are getting into a few different pieces here: model #: emachines t6524 cpu: amd athlon 64 3500+ 2.2ghz ram: 1gb ddr hd: 200gb capicity optical drive: dual layer dvdrw graphics card: integrated ati radeon xpress 200 flash media reader (not sure on this) o/s: windows xp media center 2005.  </s>
<s> so, let's go through this bit by bit: cpu: amd is advanced micro devices and are a very well known cpu maker, intel is the other big kahuna here. the &quot;athlon 64&quot; is a model number so that you have a 64 bit processor using the athlon line as opposed to their budget one. the 3500+ is a performance index, some of the other ones go up to 5000+ in the newest 64 x2 which is a dual core ones.  </s>
<s> the 2.2 ghz is the cpu speed.  </s>
<s> ram: this is the random access memory and is where things are stored in memory when your computer is running usually.  </s>
<s> bigger is better and 1 gb is a little above the common minimum of 512 mb in most new systems.  </s>
<s> my current laptop for example has 2 gb of ram but then part of that is i wanted extra ram in my machine since i tend to have some applications that use quite a bit like microsoft's visual studio.  </s>
<s> hd: hard drive is where you store various files.  </s>
<s> 200 gb is a decent sized hd though some go for the big stuff like 500 gb or that new one from seagate that has 750 gb for the upper threshold.  </s>
<s> my laptop has a mere 75 gb so your new one beats that.  </s>
<s> dual layer dvdrw: this indicates that it can read and write dvds which is a feature on my laptop though my previous desktop didn't have a dvd drive.  </s>
<s> graphics card: some will call this a video card and it is the same thing, it is what translates the computer code into a display and the more memory the better on these and depending on what games you'd play you may need some of the top of the line ones.  </s>
<s> flash media reader: i have no clue on this, sorry.  </s>
<s> o/s: windows xp media center 2005.  </s>
<s> microsoft puts out a few different flavors of xp and generally there are 3 kinds for most folks: home, media center and pro.  </s>
<s> home is the simplest and doesn't have many bells and whistles.  </s>
<s> pro is what most companies have and does have a few special add-ons since this is commonly used on networks.  </s>
<s> then there is the media center edition which i'm still researching a bit but seems to have some special things for audio and video and most systems have a built in tv tuner and other features to make their computer into an all-in-one entertainment center.  </s>
<s> hopefully that helps decode things somewhat.  </s>
<s> if you want further answers just ask as this was a general stab at things.  </s>
<s> regards, jb  </s>
<s> thanks jb, i'm getting the system for a fair price..from tigerdirect.  </s>
<s> i'm looking forward to the challenge of trying to understand all this &quot;tech&quot; i've seen both good & bad comments on this system cnet seems to have given it a 7 of 10. looking forward to getting the biggest bag for my buck with further research.  </s>
<s> once again thanks for your kind & knowledgeable reply.  </s>
<s> movin  </s>
<s> that ''ati radeon xpress 200'' is not a dedicated video card.  </s>
<s> it is video circuitry integrated into the motherboard that uses some of the slower system memory (ram).  </s>
<s> to make the system a good gaming computer, many have added a dedicated video card (one that has its own very fast memory) to the empty pci express x16 slot in the motherboard and disabled the onboard video.  </s>
<s> this also means that they install a higher wattage power supply unit (psu) to handle the video card.  </s>
<s> thanks for the explanation and advice.  </s>
<s> i'm looking forward to playing with the system and with a little help from cnet forums getting the big bang for my $$ thanks again movin  </s>
