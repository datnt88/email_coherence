the nforce 590 sli intel chipset from nvidia is the last piece of hardware that i'm waiting on so that i can finally build a core 2 duo system. does anyone here have any clue as to its release date? i heard it had a parallel release with the conroe line (released to manufacturers thurs july 27th). the retail release for the conroe e6600 and above is august 7th, i believe. but i have yet to see a definitive release date on the nforce 590 intel board.
unfortunately i can't help, at least not now. i am hoping to build maximum pc's dream machine 2006 and will need an nforce 590 sli intel edition motherboard that can accommodate the intel core 2 extreme x6800 cpu. if i hear anything i will try to post.
the maximum pc dream machine 2006 looks really nice this year -- you should check out the overclocking on the e6400...  hopefully the nforce 590 intel edition will come out soon so i can start enjoying conroe!!
