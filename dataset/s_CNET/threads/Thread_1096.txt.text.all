<s> i have a grid 19dbi outside antenna with 400 cable with a rp-tnc to male connector on the end of the cable.  </s>
<s> i have wifi here but it is weak.  </s>
<s> i have a linksys wrt54gs router.  </s>
<s> how can i connect my outside antenna cable to the internet plug of my router?  </s>
<s> then i think i can get a stronger signal.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance lwl0913  </s>
<s> that's weak.  </s>
<s> no not 400ft 400 cable thats 20ft good god man whats wrong with you  </s>
<s> your post is unclear and poorly written.  </s>
<s> however a 20 foot cable is also unacceptable.  </s>
<s> you'll want to get that down to just a few feet.  </s>
<s> i do not offer to teach rf tech here but that's far too long and will create very odd issues.  </s>

<s> simply upgrade to the new linksys dual n wireless routers.  </s>
<s> it has two n routers in one box with incredible speed and range.  </s>

<s> the 400 20ft cable works very well when the wifi trans is fairly close its just that it is weak for my usb wireless adapter.  </s>
<s> what is the purpose of going to this router will this router connect to my antenna cable?????????????????????????????  </s>
<s> i had a bum one and here's one that worked well enough over the usual home.  </s>
<s> i've ordered another one to try with my cantenna which is this one (untested yet) -&gt; it would be in your best interest to reply to your top post and rewrite it clearly what 400 is and more.  </s>
