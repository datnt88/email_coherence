i am having problems with my microphone, i can hear sound coming from the speakers, however, when i try to use my mic (record or on the web), i can't. i have tried to use the sound trouble shooter, but it doesn't help because i can't use the mic. i have also changed mics and tested both mics on other pc's.
stupid question, have you unchecked the usually checked &quot;mute&quot; button in your audio mixer panel?
yes,i sure did!!! not only did i check my general audio settings, i also checked the connections, and the mic itself to see if it was working correctly on another pc.
here is a sound card trouble shooting chart.  the first three subjects have to do with microphone and recording. .......
