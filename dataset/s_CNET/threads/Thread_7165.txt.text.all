<s> it appears the 3tb hd is here.  </s>
<s> wd, is offering it as a &quot;bootable&quot; one that being the major point.  </s>
<s> you need to have these requirements in order to use it.  </s>
<s> 1) 64-bit os 2) uefi and gpt partitioning if you system needs it, wd will provide a small pcb card in order to better i/f the hd for compatibility. the 64-bit os is very important as it addresses the capacity or volume issue, as 2.19tb is the limit for 32-bit os, thus the 64-bit os need.  </s>
<s> there are other 3tb out there but it seems the wd offered one is bootable, other will be storage only.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i don't think there's much advantage of using a large capacity harddrive like that.  </s>
<s> personally, i rather use 6-500g.  </s>
<s> or 3-1t instead (especially if the price comparison is about the same or not too much higher).  </s>
<s> to each their own decision.  </s>
<s> but, let's be clear here, there are many users of 500gb, and 1tb now hds.  </s>
<s> you're own answer offered 3x1tb as a solution, i'm sure for others it'll be a 3tb hd. as time goes by, while fairly common now, 1tb is already starting to give way to 2tb and that wasn't too long ago, some pie in the sky.  </s>
<s> while on the subject, persistent releases of ssd's are qrowing as well.  </s>
<s> so, a typical current 250gb hd maybe replaced by a 250gb ssd as costs go down.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
