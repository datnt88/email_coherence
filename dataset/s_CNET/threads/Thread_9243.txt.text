hey everyone, i am having a problem with my network, i have a netgear router with a netgear pc adapter. the connection is *very good*, but when i try to download the speeds vary from 8kb/s-&gt;20kb/s. i have tried everything from calling netgear to cleaning out my computer, nothing has worked. if anyone might have any suggestions it would be very helpful. thanks
for instance it's half duplex and shares the air space of other devices. add this that the wifi signal can travel out and reflect back to distort the transmission means that only under ideal conditions it's all good. you didn't tell much in your post such as if you are following our suggestions in the forum sticky so i hope you can use that or tell us the full details. bob
look for a quality of service setting in the router's program, it's possible the wireless has been throttled down there. i had the exact opposite problem in which my two oldest using wireless would almost steal the entire bandwith, even though i was hardwired to the modem. to slow them down and give me back bandwidth i disabled the wmm support and gave me high priority and them both low priority settings. bandwidth control can also be enabled in such section. since you seem interested in faster wifi, just do the opposite.
i have always used wireless. just 2 weeks ago i was downloading at a constant 120 kb/s. 10 days ago i installed a video card but i left the network card untouched, but after that the card has been acting weird. i download at speed from 8-12kb/s which is very depressing. help would be appreciated.thanks!
you didn't tell in either post so far. it's post number 2 at  bob
