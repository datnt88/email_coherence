hello. i recently built myself a new desktop. the specs are windows 7 64 bit home premium 3.6 ghz zambezi quad core cpu 2 x 2 gb 1600mhz ram amd 6670 sapphire gpu 500gb western digital 7200 rpm hd asrock 990fx extreme3 corsair 600w gamer series power supply i have been playing mass effect 1. i am about 15 hours into the game, no complications thus far. can run the graphics at ultra but play on medium just to not stress the gpu that much cuz i know its not the best gaming card. i went to the planet noveria and got to peak 15. when i enter the garage, all of the characters, myself and my 2 teammates, turn in to black blocks. i can run out of the garage and it is just fine. i puts me back to me. but as soon as i run in, i turn into a blob again. i checked to make sure my gpu was not overheating cuz it is only running around 45-53 celcius while playing mass effect or world of warcraft( which runs fine btw). i next went to check my drivers were up to date. first let windows 7 check to see if it needed an update. it said no. didn't trust it all the way so i went to amd to check. their site also said i was up to date next i went to the catalyst program to change settings. i went through 1 by 1 and turned everything off and would load me1. still broken. next i turned everything to max. same result. i changed all the settings in game in the same manner. no change. i figured the files for me1 must be bad so i uninstalled and reinstalled and i was still a black blob. any help that you can give me would be great cuz i am really at a loss for what is wrong. its not like that section is more graphic intense, all other games have worked fine. thanks a lot.
this sounds like another bug in another game. since the game works up to that level, i would not suspect the hardware. only the game maker may have a fix. bob
so the solution would be to update mass effect then? thanks a lot for the quick response. was a little worried as this is my first rig. thanks
updated to 1.02 which is the most recent patch i can find and no change. still blobs just in that area. can start a new guy, reload an old save on that guy. all works fine. peak 15, still broken. any other ideas?
your posts are not pointing to a hardware issue. there are far too many bugs in most games for me to list here. however there are usually forums about this game and you find folk reporting those bugs. and however (again) i am finding folk that think there are no bugs in these games. it's a big shock to some.  hmm, it looks like folk are talking about it and no absolute cure. bob
maybe i will play through with the blobs for a little bit and see if it fixes itself after this mission. thanks for all the posts.
