i have a p 3 pc with a usb 1.0 port also a p d pc with a usb 2.0 port can both of these port be used on an hp printer using an adapter
here i use no adapter since usb 1.0 is fine for printers.
since you neglected to mention the model of the printer, i have to tell you my dog broke my crystal ball. my guess is that it would, but you need to check the specs of the printer. you mentioned an adapter - again i repeat my dog broke my crystal ball. what kind of adapter and why do you think you need one? too bad about that dog, isn't it.
bob my objective is to hard wire both computers to the hp deskjet d4160 printer i have never used an adapter,so my knowledge of which one to use is nill plenty of different kinds on the internet,as access to the computers is a major project i am looking for guidance if it can be done and what product to use before i attempt to buy and install thanks for looking
wpgwpg evidently it has been a long time since you asked hp,other wise you would remember how long it takes to not get an answer sorry about your crystal ball,hope the dog did not get cut up too bad. i need an adapter because i want to hard wire both computers to the hp deskjet d4160 printer
if you share the printer between computers, you wouldn't need what you're calling an adapter. otherwise i'd say unless you want to set up a server, what you're talking about is an a-b switch which for me would be a royal pain. there're wireless printers around that might be something to consider as well. my dog is ok, but i sure miss that crystal ball.
i never have used usb as a network so that's a dead end. why not print over your current network? bob
