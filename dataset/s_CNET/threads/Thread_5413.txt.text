i just bought a dvd burner...(liteon lh-20a1p186c)...and have already installed it in my pc, but it's not showing up in windows explorer or in the hardware manager...i tried the registry trick where you delete the upper and lower filters but i don't seem to have them in my registry what seems to be the problem...? please help..thank you in advanced... by the way...here are my specs just in case: dell dimension 4500s 768mb ram intel celeron 1.70ghz processor
optical drive or did it replace another drive? make sure all cables are snug and the jumpers are correctly set.
it replaced a cd rom drive that it had...but the cd rom dive worked fine...all i did was remove the cd drive, used the same cables to plug in the dvd burner and finish...
that is, was the old drive master and the new drive same? bob
the cables that were connected to the cd rom drive are the exact same ones i used to connect the new dvd burner...the dvd burner powers on, it opens and closes, but it will not show up anywhere in the computer. e.g. the explorer....
i agree you probably got the cables on right, but you didn't address my question. bob
