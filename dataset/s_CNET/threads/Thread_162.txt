12367	8	4254	52068	52046	r. proffitt	11/29/03 1:21 pm	1.07011206e12	aha. you've found it.	it's time to pester the board supplier about this. but let me share that in your post, far too many details were left out. no long dissertations are required, but any number of items like using some odd 40 conductor cable, an odd driver here or there could do it in. or some outdated bios or missing driver. the supplier should be contacted since i don't have any list of what you built or if you did something oddball like move a drive with an os from another machine. but at least you've found the cause. bob
