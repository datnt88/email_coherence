systemax systems amd athlon (tm) processor 1.00 ghz, 512 mb ram windows xp home version 2002 service pack 2 last week my cdrw drive was left open and someone broke it with their knee. i went out and bought a new internal drive for $34 called &quot;i/o magic&quot;. the instructions say the drivers will be installed when i reboot, no software disc needed. i removed the broken drive (taking photos of every move i made and i marked all 3 cables needed). i then installed the new drive. it opened and closed and the light came on. i then went to &quot;my computer&quot; and the drive was not there. i put an audio disc in to see if it played and it didn't. i then went to i/o magics website and by it's appearance, i didn't expect much. i found drivers for this drive, downloaded and nothing. they recomended i restart in safe mode and it wouldn't. i removed he new drive and am now wondering if there's something i missed or shold have tried. any and all suggestions are appreciated.
no drivers required for that drive in xp. how is the drive jumpered? try cable select (cs) and then reboot. result?
how do i &quot;try cable select&quot; ? is that in the bios setup? this is new territory for me. i reattached the same cables used in the broken drive. thanks for your reply. p.s. i forgot to mention that my dvd drive did not appear either when i opened control panel. after removing the new cdrw it does appear.
tune-up: how to install a dvd or cd burner &quot;step 3&quot; describes the jumpering.
i got my cdrw working thanks to your detailed instructions. the email i recieved did not show your email. now i can back up my work..... again thank you, thank you, thank you!!! joan
