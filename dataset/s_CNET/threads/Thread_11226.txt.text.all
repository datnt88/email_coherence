<s> hi all, i've transplanted a few cpus and motherboards in my day... but now i've bought all the components to build my own system from scratch.  </s>
<s> i've got and athlon 64 3700+, a quality heatsink and some leftover artic silver 5. i've noticed that the artic silver site ( ) when referring to the amd 64's, it says that it's ''more important'' to cover the cpu core rather than the whole heat spreader from corner to corner.  </s>
<s> i've always had very good luck spreading a super thin layer on a processors core in the past... should i really not apply a thin layer to the entire heat spreader?  </s>
<s> is it a bad idea in general, or simply a waste of compound?  </s>
<s> if i follow the instructions and simply apply a drop (3/4 size of a bb) to the center of the heat spreader, i'll never see exactly how well the compund was spread when i applied the heatsink, which makes me uncomfortable.  </s>
<s> am i being silly?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>

<s> that they did not say to not cover the entire heat spreader.  </s>
<s> seems that they want you to know that the cpu chip itself is only about 1 sq inch and thus is only a small portion of the heat spreader.  </s>
<s> seems that they simply want you to know that you must get the compound on the specific area where the cpu die contacts the heat spreader.  </s>
<s> if i remember correctly the cpu chip is not exactly in the center of the heat spreader.  </s>
<s> thus if you get a nice uniform spread of the compound on most of the spreader you will include the most critical area.  </s>
<s> i think the logic is that with artic silver 5, they don't want you to &quot;pre-spread&quot; the stuff at all.  </s>
<s> this seemed surprising to me at the time.  </s>
<s> it's consistency dictates that you add the rice-sized drop and allow the application of the heatsink to do the work for you.  </s>
<s> i e-mailed artic silver and they said that using this method eliminates &quot;air gaps&quot;... and that if you &quot;pre-spread&quot; the compound before appyling you would most likely have air gaps.  </s>
<s> off i go! cheers.  </s>
