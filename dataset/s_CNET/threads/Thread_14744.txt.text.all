i have been tring to play a game on pogo . 
com , but i have a pop up blocker blocking the game from popping up. 
how do i find it and turn it off? 
most pop-up blockers have a key stroke to override the blocking. 
try holding down ctrl when you click on the link for the game. 
also if you are running xp sp2, you have in ie under &quot;tools&quot; the ability to control which sites allow pop ups
