<s> hi: i have a compaq presario 5700t desktop computer, with 450mhz.  </s>
<s> i would like to upgrade to a faster mhz.  </s>
<s> can i upgrade to at least a 550mhz??? thanks for your help.  </s>
<s> i don't think they make 550 mhz processors anymore.  </s>
<s> if you're planning to upgrade the cpu, you better upgrade the motherboard also.  </s>
<s> technology is moving so fast, upgrading just doesn't worth the price anymore.  </s>
<s> what kind of cpu and motherboard do you have?  </s>
<s> pii goes up to 450mhz, if you have that, then you'll have to get a new piii or p4 compatible motherboard.  </s>
<s> motherboard + cpu make up most of the cost in a computer anyway.  </s>
<s> just get a new machine, it would be easier, and probably even cheaper.  </s>
<s> actually you can find pentium iii's on ebay and pricegrabber for a good price if it's a slot 1 pentium ii box, you can run slot i pentium iii's in there (if their sub 900mhz ones, as pentium ii and pentium iii are very very close to each other in design (less difference than northwood to prescott) i would still agree with them on this though, just get a new machine  </s>
