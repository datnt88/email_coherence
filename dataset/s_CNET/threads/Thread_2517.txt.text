your steps to create accounts for each user on each machine and what you did to allow networking through your software firewalls. bob
in the network wizard i clicked: -(next) -(next) -other, (next) -this computer is connected to the internet through a network hub. other computers on the network are also connect through the network hub. (next) -description: (person's name, location) computer name: (person's nickname) (next) -work group name: our home (next) -printer sharing on (next),(yes) -(next) -just finish wizard, i dont need to run wizard on other computers repeated on all computer restarted all computers
