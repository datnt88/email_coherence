i had an i/o magic dvd+/-rw i bought back in 2004 that recently died. it was an 8 speed (8x). i recently bought a samsung sh-s182m lightscribe 18x dvdrw as a replacement unit for it. i'm buying the 18 speed discs for it, but i have a question. do i have to get rid of all my old 8x-16x discs i had or, can i still use them on my new drive? i'm currently running the nero 6 software that came with the samsung. nero has an option that allows you to slow down the burn speed for cd's, but i didn't notice one for dvd's. please advise. thanks. windows xp home edition sp 2
if all is as it should be, you just use what speed media you have and the software adjusts automatically. bob
...i received an error message telling me to pick a slower speed and try again. i'll keep at it though. thanks sir.
evidently my drive had performance anxiety for its first few burn attempts. it works fine now. thanks again.
