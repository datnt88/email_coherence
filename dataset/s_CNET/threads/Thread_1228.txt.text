maybe i'm a little to novice to ask this question, but i'm curios and would like to learn. in my opinion, am, fm, shortwave, and ham radio waves would have more coverage, or a beter signal in case some trees or other obstacles are in the way, than wifi. wouldn't it be possible to modulate and demodulate wireless network into an other radio wave? in other words have a wireless network that transmits in am, fm, short wave, or ham waves? another thought. what would the results be, or is it possible to connect a gsm or gprs access point to a network, then catch it with gprs card on the computer. wouldn't that give more coverage. (more distance) wouldn't that be a way also to connect with a cell phone, and avoid the cell phone service providers high per/bit transfer rate? what would be legal? would anyone be dangerous? etc....
i will not research what the fcc regs are but you can. can you share why you need more than what 802.11a/b/g/n wifi gives you today? bob
i'm searching for a way to get wifi or in other words, any wireless network to my parents house located 2 kilometers form my house.
see pictures and stories.  notes 3 to 5 km so your's is less than that. the only requirement is los. bob
those frequencies you mention are relatively low. because of this the data transmission will be low. higher frequency means higher data speed. data can be and is sent within those lower frequencies. but it's usually slower than dialup. if you'll dig a little, notice the specific frequencies involved with the b, g, and n ranges and notice the associated data rates.
is it possable to set up a gsm or gprs access point from ones own network? wouldn't that have a high range?
i was under an impression you wanted a 2km link from your house to theirs. but that's not it? there are evdo routers that take the usual data card from your telco/cellco and work great for remote locations. bob
