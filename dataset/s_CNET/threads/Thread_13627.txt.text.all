<s> hi just need to know if these parts will work together well as a gaming pc. really new at this stuff so any advice would be great thanks processor (cpu)- advanced options intel core i7 3820 quad core 10mb 3.6ghz hyperthreading lga2011 processor  </s>
<s> not a computer expert by anymeans.  </s>
<s> but i did do some brief research on the 680s because they are such a new product.  </s>
<s> one thing of note is that they are extremely power efficient.  </s>
<s> that entire build could probably be absolutely fine with a much lower power supply then a 1050 watt.  </s>
<s> find a calculator somewhere on the internet and see what it takes to run that build with two gtx 580's.  </s>
<s> i bet it is still under 1050 watts and the 680s are i think use like 30-40%less power meaning you would be fine with a 800-900 watt psu.  </s>
<s> other then that where is this computer coming from?  </s>
<s> i'm in the market for a new computer and am 2 lazy to build  </s>
<s> planning to buy it from ncix.  </s>
<s> at first was looking to buy the vesta i7 6030 base then i did some research and tweaked all the parts of that system for max gaming performance.  </s>
<s> this is what i came up with lol  </s>
<s> selecting the basics (motherboard, cpu,) is almost child's play at this point; as long as you ascertain the same socket for both, you can't go wrong - the same can't be said for the rest of your build, as it becomes more personal (and what your budget will allow for).  </s>
<s> after reviewing your choices, i'd like to offer some alternatives (with reasoning provided): pc case: your choice - thermaltake level 10 gt black my choice: nzxt switch 810 why: it will contain all that you selected; with the added bonuses of having an sd card slot reader already installed, the allowance for up to 3 radiators (if you choose to water cool the pc), optional fan mounting (either 120 or 140mm), hdd cage removal, etc it's almost $100 less than the level 10 (not including the sd card reader -$19) monitor: your choice - samsung b2240ew 22&quot; widescreen lcd monitor ($379) my choice: asus ve278q 27in widescreen lcd monitor why: 5&quot; bigger, 2ms response (for gaming), hdmi, display port, dvi, and $60 cheaper antivirus: your choice - panda global protection 2010 bilingual oem w/ 1 year subscription ($30) my choice: microsoft security essentials why: will do pretty much everything that the paid versions will...free  </s>
<s> thanks for the response.  </s>
<s> i dunno that case is just a little plain for me.  </s>
<s> i chose the thermaltake level 10 because it just looks like a beast whenever i look at it.  </s>
<s> not sure, just really love the case and willing to pay the extra money for it.  </s>
<s> also the 27 inch is way too big for where i'm gonna be placing monitor.  </s>
<s> i actually chose another monitor since i've made this post samsung s23a700d 23in widescreen led lcd montor 1920x1080 120hz 3d 2ms dvi-d hdmi(400) this way i can play in 3d 1920x1080 and 120hz an make use of my 680 a bit more.  </s>
<s> let me know what you think.  </s>
<s> as for the antivirus yeah i wasn't sure about pdp.  </s>
<s> guess i'll just scrap it and go with that lol  </s>
<s> be aware that gigabyte's motherboards have a full lineup of x79 motherboards,; ud3 being the entry level, ud7 being top-of-the-line ( this goes for whatever chipset you're thinking of getting).  </s>
<s> for the amount of money you're planning on spending for the motherboard/ cpu; if your looking for a fast pc, you might want to reconsider an i5 2500k or an i7 2600k/ 2700k...as the x79 series aren't as fast as people expected.  </s>
<s> but, it all depends on what you're wanting to do with your new pc... as for microsoft essentials; i've been running it on my last 3 pc's, and never been infected with any form of virus/ malware since installing it...more than i can say for f-secure, etc. if you're bored of the typical &quot;boxy&quot; pc case; the thermaltake level 10 gt is definitely not in the same league, but if you want to house all that you can ( + maybe even the kitchen sink), i can think of a few more that you might fancy pricing starts @ $480 euros pricing starts @ $399.99 us currently (in stock) selling @ $239.99 cad/ $252.42 us  </s>
<s> the cooler master cosmos ii in stock @ ncix.com (us) $342.99 &lt;div&gt;review: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; everything about this case screams quality, but not just that, it also shows what a manufacturer can do when they design a case for an enthusiast rather than for an accountant... &quot;&lt;/div&gt;  </s>
<s> sorry, still gonna stick with the thermaltake =]  </s>
<s> oh and about the motherboard i'm actually going with the asus rampage iv extreme/bf3 e-atx lga2011 x79 ddr3 sata3 usb3.0 5pci-e16 sli crossfirex motherboard now.  </s>
<s> any thoughts on it  </s>
<s> i have to admit; that i've never had any other manufacturers' motherboard in any of my (home-built) pc's, never had a problem (nor had to rma) any of their boards you might have a problem actually getting your hands on the new nvidia gpu's; i've read on many sites, that they're hard to come by (not unlike the amd high-end cards).  </s>
<s> if you have any concerns/ problems when it comes time to actually build your new pc, you know where to find me  </s>
<s> guess i'll have to order the 680 this week so i can be put on backorder atleast.  </s>
<s> as long as my pc is built and ready by the time diablo 3 comes out =] thanx for the help =] i'll update when i start to build  </s>
