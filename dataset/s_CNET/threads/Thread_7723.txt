(i used my cable tv cord for input). but it always scanned and found no channels (this same cable tv works well with my tv). then when i tried to access tv from the media center there came an error message : no tv device found. i reconnected and checked all the connections. everything was ok. then i searched for drivers online the ones i got on were on the pinnacle windows vista pledge. they said to download pinnacle media center patch 4.7. but the size of the file is 251 mb. i use a slow dial-up connection. it will take me 15 to 20 hours downloading such a file even while using a download manager. i need help with this. is there any way i can download only the drivers without the pinnacle media center? so that i can use my tv tuner device with windows media center (on windows vista). this will reduce the file size i will have to download and also i'm not very comfortable with pinnacle media center, as i am with windows media center. also is there any way i can do the same with my desktop (windows xp) which does not have a windows media center even. thank you in advance. its very frustrating that i cant use my device.
