i have 2 new toshiba laptops, a l45-s7423, and a a205-s7468, they are running vista. they are connected wirelessly. they will both connect to the internet, however, only the a205-one will print on (new) hp7280 printer. in control panel network and sharing page, the settings are identical on both computers. i also have an older hp desktop, which runs xp and is connected to the router with an ethernet cable.. it will also print wirelessly on the printer. i don't understand why!! what do i do??? help
your firewall is preventing it. have you looked?
several times. the firewall settings are identical &lt;bs&gt;
