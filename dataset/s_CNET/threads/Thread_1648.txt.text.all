<s> i was doing some digging and found that in many instances, the core i750 gets nearly equal performance with the core i7 920 in games for both single card and sli configurations.  </s>
<s> the 920 has hyper threading but i am not sure what the significance of this is because the threads aren't actual physical threads i am considering an upgrade and the i5 setup would be much cheaper, but i don't know if the performance is truly equal could anybody comment on this?  </s>
<s> my new applications in .net  </s>
<s> have more threads than my pillow case.  </s>
<s> it's threadtastic!  </s>
<s> tossing aside the financial considerations, i'd get the i7. if i just needed a nice machine, i'd get the i5. bob  </s>
<s> 920 prices are down considerably altho tri-ram will still cost you.  </s>
<s> since you asked, you must be somewhat price sensitive, in which case 750 will be fine.  </s>
<s> i actually have 1 of core i5 750...works perfectly... link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp?product_id=72744  </s>
