<s> i have a case with front usb ports, but no pinout on the motherboard.  </s>
<s> i know that i could add front usb access in other ways via drive bays but was interested in using the ports already built in the front of my case.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> yes there is such a card.  </s>
<s> you should be able to find one to do what you would like to do and the prices for them are pretty reasonable.  </s>
<s> so just look for a pci usb card.  </s>
<s> just make sure you got an available pci slot on your mobo.  </s>
<s> i was hoping for something more specific like manufacturer or some such.  </s>
<s> i've already looked at many pci usb cards and hadn't seen the type i was talking about.  </s>
<s> has anyone had personal experience with such so that i could get the name?  </s>
<s> i have one and you can chose front or back ports.  </s>
