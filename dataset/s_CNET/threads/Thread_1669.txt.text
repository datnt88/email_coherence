so i was wondering if it was possible to use an add-in card and the intergrated video on a motherboard at the same time..like crossfire. ....and if the intergrated video was nvidia that was/is set up as a physx to supplement the ati add-in. i am not sure if it is possible i have an original physx ageia card (pci) but now nvidia owns it and maybe they would not let such a thing work.
like crossfire = no. let's keep it short.
i know it would not look like crossfire; thats ati. sli is nvidia. i just wanted to know if i could run them at the same time as physx and ati
as you suspected, the code, the drivers would not do this.
