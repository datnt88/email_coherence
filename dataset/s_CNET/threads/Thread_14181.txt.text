i'm wanting to build a low-end graphics workstation. it's sole function will be for digital illustration: 2-d rendering, so i know i don't need all the crazy performance for animation and such... but i also understand certain components are better for graphics programs and the like, but i don't understand enough to make an intelligent purchase. all i need is a bare bones set-up: case motherboard cpu video card memory power supply i've already got drives, and monitor, etc this isn't supposed to be a dream machine, all i care about is comfortable performance: i want be able to work big, and in multiple layers without freezing-up, that's it.
here's a suggestion that has enough oomph to handle illustrator and/or photoshop. all prices are estimates from web stores and include shipping. shop around and you might be able to save a bit more. (i suggest zipzoomfly.com.) ecs 945g-m3 pentium d motherboard: $95 intel pentium d 805, 2.6ghz dual core cpu: $125 corsair vs2gbkit533d2, 2gb ddr2-533 kit: $160 (sony/lg/liteon) dvd+-rw dvd burner: $65 sapphire radeon x1600xt pcie 256mb video card: $150 antec solution slk2650bqe w/350w power supply: $80
i appreciate you taking the time to sort that out for me.
