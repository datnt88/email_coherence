<s> hey guys, i just wanted some feedback on the question of if i should replace my two year old asus k50ij laptop with the new asus transformer tf201.  </s>
<s> i'm mainly looking for a more portable alternative to a laptop to bring to my college classes and i'll also be mainly using it for extensive media consumption, i.e. video's, web surfing, games and such.  </s>
<s> one of the main reasons why i'm considering this so much is that i would have a desktop at home that has microsoft office loaded onto it.  </s>
<s> my plan is to at least be able to start word/powerpoints on the tablet and then be able to finish and edit them at home on the desktop.  </s>
<s> any suggestions/feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks!  </s>
<s> if you look at games they are a different class than pc gaming.  </s>
<s> as to the office there is no microsoft office for that tablet and some rushed out and bought this to learn that later on.  </s>
<s> curb the enthusiasm and do a little more search and demand a demo of the apps that let you open office documents.  </s>
<s> i found them to be ok but no replacement for the real thing.  </s>
<s> i'm back to a laptop but still have 3 tablets on my desk as we work on android apps.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have a sony viao that is my main computer an had a net book.  </s>
<s> well the net book was good for a time but slow.  </s>
<s> replaced it with an ipad.  </s>
<s> my dad has dell laptop and netbook.  </s>
<s> same problem.  </s>
<s> laptop too big to travel with netbook to slow.  </s>
<s> we looked at transformer for him but he chose a hp 11 inch full laptop.  </s>
<s> has 6 gig ram and a decent hard drive.  </s>
<s> he loves it.  </s>
<s> portable but able to do every thing he wants.  </s>
<s> i made this move about 6 months ago.  </s>
<s> at first to a net book and now to the prime.  </s>
<s> i use google apps which are not as functional as ms office but the do the job when out and about, store docs on the cloud and use a htc sensation as a hot spot to provide the 3g connection that the prime is missing.  </s>
<s> i save docs to the cloud then access at home and if need be download and finish off in ms office (which is not very often).  </s>
<s> its not perfect but it is relatively hassle free, the number of quality 3g and free wifi connections seem to be improving and i carry very little with me as we scan all incoming mail.  </s>
<s> we have recently ported our business application to the cloud on rackspace and now have full 24/7 access to our environment from mostly anywhere.  </s>
<s> benefits too many to mention, downside a change of thinking required.  </s>
