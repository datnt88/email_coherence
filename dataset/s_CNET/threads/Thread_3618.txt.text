emachines t3092 athlon 3000+ 2.17ghz 2g ram, windows xp just had put in e-geforce 7600 gs agp graphics card, says on the box it requires 400w psu. so upgraded my 300w to a 450w. was getting error message on boot saying that not enough power was going to the graphics card so it was lowering performance so as not to damage hardware. so i got a 600w psu put in there, and still the same thing is happening. why? and what do i try next?
an additional/required power lead to the video card or to a special location on the mobo for that purpose??? i got that message on a system a few weeks ago. in one there was a place near the bottom of the mobo to connect a 4 pin molex to.
thanks, finally had a chance to get the case opened, and it was the extra power connection that was unhooked. all's well now.
