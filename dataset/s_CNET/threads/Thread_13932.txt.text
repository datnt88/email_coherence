i wanna get started on my own custom pc, which i hope to ugrade later. i have parts like cd rom, and floppy drive, and a harddrive, also a monitor, and keyboard and mouse. i checked out oveclocking.com becase my friend recomended it and he has built many computers. heres what i found. i was just wondering if any1 knew if the parts were compatible with each other, i have a socket 939 motherboard, and a socket 939 cpu. its sli too. case :coolermaster centurion 530 - black (no psu) (ca-083-cm) psu :hiper hpu-4k580-mk type r 580w modular atx2.2 psu - red uv (ca-008-hp) cpu :amd athlon 64 3200+ venice 90nm (socket 939) - retail (ada3200bpbox) (cp-118-am) ram :crucial 1gb ddr pc3200 cas3 (ct12864z40b) (my-030-cr) soundcard :creative sound blaster audigy se 7.1 sound card - oem (sc-040-cl) motherboard :gigabyte k8n sli nforce4 sli (socket 939) pci-express motherboard (mb-040-gi) graphics card (sli ready) :xfx geforce pcx6600 gt extreme gamers edition 128mb ddr3 tv-out/dual dvi (pci-express) - retail (pvt43gndd7) (gx-046-xf) i would be happy if any pro's or experts would tell just from looking. thankyou.
also i would considering getting the nvidia 6800gs instead for the gfx card. also the ram isnt very good. i would get something from ocz or corsair xms but i'm not sure about your budget also u can skimp down on the cpu. go with the 3000+ venice core. 3200+ is not that much of a boost. also i dont think the sound card is necessary. and i never heard of the company of your psu b4. but other than that pretty good. and depending on the price of the mobo, u could change it to something from asus, msi, or dfi. all of those are good. others which are pretty good would be epox, chaintech, abit, etc. but the gigabyte one would be good.
i would look into a better psu, a dvd-rom, or media-card reader? don't forget extra fans for cooling, windows and arctic silver 5,if you don't have windows cd, but oem or layman, if you have a store-bought windows computer's hard drive. crucial ram, suggest change to corsair value instead. other than that, looks good. roger
i would if i were you try and go to nvidia78oogtx
cheers thanks im going to look into that. ash
big help ive gon 4 the 3000, coz like u sed the 3200 aint tht much betta thanks lots asg
