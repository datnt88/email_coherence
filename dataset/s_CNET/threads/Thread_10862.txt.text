hi, i am a little new to networking, so please be patient with me. well, i have a desktop computer running xp pro with 1 ethernet jack which is connected to a dsl modem. i have a laptop which is running 98 with 1 ethernet jack. is there a way i can simultaneously let both computers acess the internet? if you require any info please, just ask. thanx ibrahim jadoon
buy a multiport wired/wireless router and attach both pcs to the ethernet ports. the routers setup guide will explain the details.
sounds like a dlink or linksys &quot;router&quot; is needed. that run about 41 bucks. the product comes with a manual which may be online at linksys.com and dlink.com bob
okay, thats what i thought. but is ther a cheaper way, like something like a ethernet splitter. but thank you ibrahim jadoon
my setup, all d-link: dcm-200 cable modem di-614+ four port wired/wireless router dfe-530tx+ nics in three desktops dwl-650 wireless nic for a laptop since you already have the modem and nics in the pcs all you need is the router and cables. d-link has excellent support both on line and email (don't ask me how i know). good luck, telephony facts, analog/digital explained. see the cnet faces behind the posts. i think computer viruses should count as life. i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. we've created life in our own image. - - stephen w. hawking
thanx, i going with d-link then thanx again ibrahim jadoon
