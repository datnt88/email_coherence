<s> i'm hoping to get advice on what the best/fastest cable modem/router device is?  </s>
<s> i currently have a motorola surfboard sbg6580.  </s>
<s> it works good, but it interferes with my direct tv so i can't use it and need to find another.... so, what is the best??? price doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> i just want the best one.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> not sure why this or any other would interfere.  </s>
<s> is there more to this story?  </s>
<s> i have no clue, neither does directv, but they are the ones that told me i can't use this modem with their service.  </s>
<s> so is there any other modem/router combo unit that is better?  </s>
<s> i have to guess at this point you are dropping the cable internet service so with that out of the way, your new service will determine what modem is required.  </s>
