i just put in a belkin n adapter for my desktop. i am going from a belkin g adapter to this new one. i am getting 48.0mpbs where i was getting 54.0mpbs with the belkin g adapter. do you think it has anything to do with the usb ports? if it does how can i make it work so i am getting the most out of the new belkin n adapter? thank you.
and how did you determine you were getting 54mbps then vs 48mbps now?
that long discussion and they discovered that we still want to keep all n gear from the same maker. you'll also want to set the wifi router to n only. bob
