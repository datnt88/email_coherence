i want to add a 1 gb memory module to my 256 mb dell dimension 2400. (winxp home, sp3). the machine supports ddr-266 (pc2100) and ddr-333 (pc2700). i dont know which one is currently in it. if i add a ddr-333 module will it work ok if the original module is a ddr-266? if not, is there a way to find out what kind of memory it has? *
or download cpu-z:  you can mix ram, but it will run at the speed of the slowest stick. do not get ddr-400 since it can be problematic in pcs that don't explicitly support it.
pcs.  might be better to put the 1gb dimm in the first slot and the old 256mb dimm in the 2nd slot. good luck. vapcmd
