(basically the amount of 'ports' allowed) i am not certain of the weakness' here except that if an additinal person needs to access your network you need to add an extra port. d) disabling ssid broadcast note, d can cause issues with older hardware.

9679	55	200346	2397472	2391190	cyberdoc2k	2/7/07 2:27 pm	1.17085842e12	wpa/wpa2 security.	i guess i'll weigh in on how secure wpa/wpa2 is. at present the only effective attack against wpa/wpa2, is an offline dictionary attack. if you use a paasphrase for your psk that consists of a word found in the dictionary, then you are extremely vulnerable. in one demonstation the word sausages was used. i took a little over 3 minutes to retrieve the psk. when precomputed hashes were used it took only 0.2 seconds. to mitigate this threat, complex random psk's must be used. ideally, you want to use a 64 digit hexidecimal. using a hex of this size negates the offline dictionary attack, since a hex is not going to be in a dictionary file, and a 64 digit hex is used as the pairwise master key, avoiding the hashing procces that creates the vulnerability. this leaves an attacker with one optio, a good old fashion brute force attack. if a 64 digit hex is use then each of the 2^256 possibilities must be check. that comes out to 1.1579208923731619542357098500869x10^77 possibilities. if you could produce a device that could check a billion billion possibilities (no such device exists at present), then it would take you 3.671x10^51 years to check each possibility. needless to say, this make the brute force method computationally infeasable. if you do not have a tool to produce such a value, simply go to:  while there is no such thing as forever secure, (once upon a time it was computationally infeasable to brute force des) with a little effort you can make wpa/wpa2 reasonably secure.
