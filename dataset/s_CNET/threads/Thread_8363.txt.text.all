<s> i currently do all my work on a mac but would like to switch to a tablet for at least half of what i do (it's a challenge to tote my laptop everywhere i need to go).  </s>
<s> i'd like to find a tablet that is functional with spreadsheets like excel or numbers and/or can use a program or app like photoshop (i don't need it for photo editing, but rather for creating simple backgrounds and designs with text and then saved in jpg).  </s>
<s> ideally i'd like both options, but i recognize that i might not be able to get everything i want.  </s>
<s> i use polaris office on my smartphone but am not a big fan - perhaps it's because of a small screen or a poor phone?  </s>
<s> - because editing is difficult and it's a challenge to retrieve my changes.  </s>
<s> i'm using a droid smartphone and really like things like google play.  </s>
<s> but since everything i do is on a mac am i better off with ipad just because of compatibility?  </s>
<s> how easy is it to use numbers on an ipad?  </s>
<s> i also am with verizon, so it would need to be usable with their 4g network.  </s>
<s> other needs are so simple i think any tablet would fit the bill: email, playing music, web browsing, some e-reading.  </s>
<s> thanks for any direction!  </s>
<s> we have numbers on the ipad.  </s>
<s> but for photoshop you may have to consider a windows 8 pro tablet.  </s>
<s> notice the s pen?  </s>
<s> i find many don't want touch features but the ability to draw on the tablets.  </s>
<s> that means you want an s pen.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the pen is definitely intriguing.  </s>
<s> although the cost is about the same as an ipad.  </s>
<s> it looks like photoshop express is the only thing compatible with windows 8 pro - which as far as i can tell is only for photo editing.  </s>
<s> are there other apps or software tools that go beyond just photos?  </s>
<s> (text on a designed background) numbers on the ipad is a positive - didn't realize that was an option.  </s>
<s> i assume the cloud is the easiest way to ensure changes are captured between devices?  </s>
<s> and does that mean that excel is available on windows 8 pro tablet?  </s>
<s> but what does that mean for document sharing with my mac?  </s>
<s> &quot;it looks like photoshop express is the only thing compatible with windows 8 pro&quot; windows 8 pro can run the same photoshop as you do on laptops and desktops.  </s>
<s> this is the surest way to assure that you get everything you asked for.  </s>
<s> ms office is available and since it's windows 8 pro, you should be able to run windows office 2003 to today's current version as well as the free libreoffice.  </s>
<s> can you define document sharing?  </s>
<s> here i just put my docs and such on dropbox and can access them on all my machines.  </s>
<s> to me that's document sharing.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> a quick search on the adobe forum last night was only showing photoshop express, however after looking again this morning i see that express is the latest news, not the only option.  </s>
<s> so i recant that question and appreciate your correction.  </s>
<s> document sharing - in terms of compatibility between devices and retaining changes.  </s>
<s> i've only used icloud, google docs and polaris office to share files from one device to another.  </s>
<s> i've been pleased with icloud, horrid experience with google docs (it's a pain to import back to my mac) and can only seem to share in one direction with polaris.  </s>
<s> after just learning that i can only print from an ipad using their special printer, that's probably not an option.  </s>
<s> right now printing isn't important, but it's a possibility in the future.  </s>
<s> looks like windows 8 pro is easy to install printer software.  </s>
