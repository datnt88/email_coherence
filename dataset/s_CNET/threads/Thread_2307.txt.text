i am looking at used workstations. any suggestions? looking at the dells specifically. i will install hard drive, more ram or os if necessary. any recommendations on workstations versus building one myself. i don't plan on using it for gaming, video editing or design. only want it for web surfing and home office use.
why not look at freecycle and the free area of craig's list if you as inclined to low to zero cost machines? bob
no rebuilding necessary.
i am looking at workstation computers only. doesn't dell use different hardware for the workstations versus the home pc? if lenovo or ibm has used workstation desktops, i wouldn't discount one of them either.
are work stations, but complete. unless you want what we used to call a dumb terminal? don't know where you can get one of them. but the ibms are complete machines. no need to add anything at all. unless you just want to go to the trouble of installing hardware, an os, digging for drivers, and spending hours on this. me, i'll take a complete working machine any day, especially at that price. good luck on your hunt for a dumb terminal.
a workstation (even used/refurb'd) is definitely overkill. workstations usually use more expensive cpus and ram (any may have professional graphics card with certified open-gl support) and they won't do diddly for your intended use. i suggest you look into a desktop from any major brand that has core i3 or i5 for $600 and save yourself money and get a full warranty. any new core i5 based desktop will be faster than a two or three year old workstation.
