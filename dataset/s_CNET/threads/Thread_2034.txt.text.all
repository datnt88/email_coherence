<s> i built a new computer with a stock intel 3 ghz cpu and fan. the fan is unbelieveable loud. is this a common problem with the intel fans?  </s>
<s> should i just buy a less loud aftermarket fan?  </s>
<s> any thoughts on why it's so loud?  </s>
<s> thanks for any help.  </s>

<s> my intel supplied fans have been very quiet.  </s>
<s> if you got some third party fan, i'd believe it, but do call the supplier and ask for an exchange.  </s>

<s> nope, it's a stock intel fan. it is so loud.  </s>
<s> any thoughts?  </s>
<s> also, put in a new case at the same time as cpu.  </s>
<s> could it be the fault of the case?  </s>
<s> thanks russ  </s>
<s> power down and check the fan blade area to see if anything is touching the fan blades as they spin around.  </s>
<s> every once in awhile, someone will have a bent blade or a cable the is in the wrong place, but i bought some intel hsfs to replace some third party fans so to drop some noise.  </s>
