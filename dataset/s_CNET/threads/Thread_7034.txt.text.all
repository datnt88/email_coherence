<s> i just purchased an acer aspire m3300-u1332 computer.  </s>
<s> the specs include amd phenom ii x4 810 2.60ghz processor 6gb ddr3 1066 memory 1 tb sata hard drive integrated ati radeon hd 3200 graphics card vga and hdmi monitor ports two 5.25 inch bays three 3.5 inch bays windows 7 home premium 64-bit os one dvdrw optical drive 300 watt psu i bought this on the spur of the moment because i thought i was getting a good deal at $500 with no tax and free shipping.  </s>
<s> however, no disks came with it.  </s>
<s> so my question is &quot;do you think this really is a good deal or should i exchange it before the 30-day period expires for something with a better reputation for quality, reliability and customer service.&quot;  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> that gpu is quite at the low end. the price is ok but i'd skip this one for any i3 powered machine and a better gpu.  </s>

<s> what gpu do you recommend?  </s>
<s> i don't do gaming, just e-mails, net surfing, photo editing and slide shows.  </s>
<s> is acer a reliable brand?  </s>
<s> i've yet to see anything i'd call reliable.  </s>
<s> just one mistake and the os fails.  </s>
<s> just one malware and it's failing.  </s>
<s> this is not reliable.  </s>
<s> sorry but reliable is something i write about toasters and refrigerators, not computers.  </s>
