i have a intel 865perll board and would like to know what is the fastest processor i can use. i have lost track of the terms used anymore so it would help me if you could link to the fastest processor and maybe one a little slower if there is a large price difference. thank you gene
it's the first question noted at  try that. bob
this is the only fast processor that fits the board.  i told you i have been away from this sort of thing for a while. and about all i got from that link was i need a cpu with 512 l2 cache. (northwood) and this is the only fast processor i could find that fits that bill. (i think) thanks
that you have? it sure seems that the link that robert gave you shows the answers to your question. why did you limit it to the link that you sent?
but my board # is aac27646-206 which seems to rule out the top 8 processors on the list or am i missing something? it seems i can only use a cpu with 512 l2 cache or again do i not understand? and after googling the only cpu i could find like that over 3 gb was that board. and its too expensive i can almost get a new board and cpu for that price. does that board require the northwood cpu? thanks again
