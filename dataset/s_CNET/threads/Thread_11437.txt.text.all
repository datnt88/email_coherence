<s> good day i am trying to connect a computer to my network and this is the problem. the lan cable i have is too short to reach the dsl router that i have and was wondering if i could do one of two things and if i can how to do it.  </s>
<s> maybe i can do neither but here is my thought.  </s>
<s> first way: i have a d-link model di-524 so could i plug in the cable from my dsl modem to the d-link wan plug and then run a cable to the computer, or second way: i have 2 built in lan ports on my asus p6t-deluxe so could i run a lan cable from the second lan port to the other computer.  </s>
<s> i have long enough cable to do either one of these, just don't know if it will work.  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> i really don't want to string another cable through if i don' have to.  </s>
<s> thanks sean hope this is clear and enough info.  </s>
<s> it would still seem to me that getting a longer cable is the best way to go.  </s>
<s> if bridging between the ports on another computer is possible, so is getting the right length of cable.  </s>
<s> they aren't that expensive.  </s>
<s> while it's probably possible to bridge two ethernet ports on one pc...and i've not done that...there is going to be a downside.  </s>
<s> is a longer cable not an option?  </s>
<s> the computer that has the 2 lan ports is halfway between the dsl modem and the second computer and i have a cable long enough to reach the second computer.  </s>
<s> the computers are on the same floor so easy to run a cable. the dsl modem is on a different floor and at the othe end of the house, running a cable would not be easy so i thought maybe with equipment i have i could cheat and make it easy.  </s>
<s> oh well, just a thought.  </s>
<s> thanks very much sean  </s>
<s> in this forum in the top 2 posts you find post 17 that gives you an overview of how to use your d-link model di-524.  </s>
<s> i don't know the specs of that model but it should have at least 4 ports.  </s>
<s> a router also offers another measure of security.  </s>
<s> even if i had only one pc, it would connect to the modem through a router.  </s>
<s> modem &gt; router &gt; computer.  </s>
<s> you can connect as many computer as you want to the open ports.  </s>
<s> if you run out of ports, you can connect a switch to the router and connect some more computers  </s>
