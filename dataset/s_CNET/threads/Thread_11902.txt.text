hi, i just formatted my hd and tried to install the vga drivers downloaded from the nvidia site. the dowload goes ok but when running the setup it gives an error 'cant find drivers for your hardware'. im certain i dowloaded the right drivers for my card. i've done this 10 times or so and this has never happend. any help apreciated. the manufacturer of the card is eagle. system: pentium iii 733mhz 256mb ram windows xp eagle nvidia geforce2 mx400
the motherboard drivers, it might need that to install the nvidia driver.
i have an old gf vid card. as i played with nvidia drivers i got to a level where support for my card was dropped.....can't find drivers. benchmark wise...i find that i can't beat the old drivers from the maker.
