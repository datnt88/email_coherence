<s> hi, i bought a new memory slot for my old pc and installed it it worked well , but when i installed my old memory slot with the new one the windows stopped and a blue screen appear which says that windows stopped to not cause some damage ,but the old memory slot was working well before i installed it with the new one they are the same module and the same speed sorry about my english  </s>
<s> i'd talk to those that know your machine and see what they think.  </s>
<s> i have some ideas but for now can't give advice with only this story.  </s>

<s> the motherboard is via p4m800-8237 and i think that the link above provide some information about my pc  </s>
<s> and clicking it takes me to and 404 not found. the p4m800 is many years old so for now my advice is a good cleaning, replace all heatsink compound, check fans and if the psu is over 4 years old, replace that with same rating but add 100 more watts. the reason why is well discussed but given the lack of detail in this discussion i have to move to the usual answer for an old pc. bob  </s>
