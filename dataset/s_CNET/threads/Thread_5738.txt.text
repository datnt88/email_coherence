hey, i'm having a very annoying problem. just after windows xp pro launches on my computer, the motherboard begins to let out one long annoying beep and it doesn't stop. i have no idea what is causing it and i can't get it to quit with the beep. it is really loud and makes it so i can't use my pc out of sheer frustration. what is the problem and how can i fix it? thanks!
you may want to remove the case cover to see if the fan is in place, the airflow is good and the fan is not blocked. bob
of course, a real phone tech support type would probably just tell you to unplug the speaker. kidding, just kidding!
