i bought a buffalo hds-ph320u2-us external hard drive that requires a password to mount, but this hard drive does not support mac os x 10.6 and later. it works on my windows 7 pc and i know that i can access it through vmware or bootcamp, but i want a way to access it without any of those. is it possible to bypass or format the external hard drive so i don't need to enter a password in order to mount it on my mac?
try the answer at
try this on the buffalo tech forum.
yea, i asked that on yahoo answers the link you showed me did not help b/c i want this to work on mac and want to get rid of the password
i thought you should have asked this on the buffalo forum. i don't have this drive to try the usual tools. bob
