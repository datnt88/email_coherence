(btw, is that a typo in the mobo description?) the only thing that isn't very very best in it's field is just the cpu and gpu. if you are getting solid numbers in games, i would upgrade the cpu. if it is sluggish in non-gpu intensive apps, like uh... word? (lol) jk, but you know that i mean, right? also, whats the wattage, make, and maybe rails of the psu? name and series would work, too. a reasonable upgrade for the mobo would be either semi-entry line x2, maybe the 4200+ or if you look hard enough, you could squeeze in a 4400+. (mobo does support x2) i think they have the same clock, not sure though. think it is more advanced in other things. anyways, if you get a gpu i'd go for a 7800gt, easily in your budget. or do want to buy both a gpu and a cpu? otherwise, the machine looks good. good luck, and remember in the end: its your call. ~ibrahim~
