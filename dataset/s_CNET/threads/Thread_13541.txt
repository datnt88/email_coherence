(it always had problem getting pass 15% for the standard test) any suggestions are welcome

(even after i set the clocks to 5-4-4-12 as shown on the package manually)
52	7	354319	3103743	3103689	r. proffitt	8/15/09 3:56 pm	1.25035176e12	and in the bios pages what does it show for	the ram voltage and timing? not all bios will show this so sometimes i'll use the ram's &quot;spec&quot; and set it manually.
52	8	354319	3103760	3103743	sj721	8/15/09 5:03 pm	1.25035578e12	voltage and timing	for the voltage part, for both kinston and murshkin, it's 1.8v as labeled on the ram for the cycles, i tried manually setting the cycles to whatever that's listed in the cpu-z info and the problem remains. i'm starting to think if there is something wrong with the motherboard. the chance of getting stucking at exactly the same place during windows memeory test due to ram is really low i think. also, as i noticed, when i turned the sound chip off in bios, the frequency of crash reduced significantly in windows and in some of the games... i'm going to see if i can get hold of a similar motherboard and have a try. thanks
52	9	354319	3103774	3103760	r. proffitt	8/15/09 5:11 pm	1.25035626e12	ok, now add 0.1v	i find that some boards need just a tad more. beats changing ram, boards, etc.
52	10	354319	3103860	3103774	sj721	8/15/09 8:54 pm	1.25036964e12	adding volt	i added to 1.9v and the problem still remains (using the mushkin ram)

52	13	354319	3104037	3104044	r. proffitt	8/16/09 7:44 am	1.25040864e12	just so you know.	i have this old other machine that did the same. after much going around in circles i got lucky and a nvidia card was freed up at the office. for that machine it cured it. but look at power supplies like your car. your car might go 120mph but let's say you go 100. now while it can go faster you will experience issues at 100 and the occasional failure much sooner than say at 65 over the same number of miles. some don't get that the same thing happens with power supplies. my longest lasting and least trouble machines had about double to more watts than what they needed at any time. i'd still head for the driver version they did those tests at because its ati... bob

52	15	354319	3104705	3104037	sj721	8/17/09 6:44 am	1.25049144e12	found it	err, i finally found it. it was the motherboard. when i tried it on a p5q turbo board everything was fine.
