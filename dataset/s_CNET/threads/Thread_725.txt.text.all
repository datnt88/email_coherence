<s> &quot;is this wireless router compatible with my speedtouch ucb adsl modem?&quot;  </s>
<s> no. your adsl modem must have an ethernet port.  </s>
<s> no. i haven't seen a wireless router that will use an usb adsl modem.  </s>

<s> if i buy one of those new adsl wirless router/modem combo will i have to have one of our laptops turned on and running the whole time?  </s>
<s> and will this be a fairly easy set up, as in i just have to plug this wireless router/modem into the phone line correct?  </s>
<s> thanks so much!  </s>
<s> jenny  </s>
<s> i would not buy such a device.  </s>
<s> i do buy the occasional dsl or cable modem and use the router to share such.  </s>
<s> stories abound about the wonder boxes and firmware issues so i just don't buy such.  </s>
