<s> i have a linksys b router on my main pc and a wireless pci card for my old pc which was win98, mine is xp, now i have another xp and tried to use same for this one but nothing, i got a wireless g pci card.  </s>
<s> i wonder if i can use with b router, i called linksys about the b to b connection but no help, they tried saying something missing from software, i think.  </s>
<s> i t just won't make the connection, i am connected with the wired from room to room but that looks sloppy, with a cord going across the house, is there something i can do to get connected wireless, thanks in advance  </s>
<s> one question before we delve deeper - did you install the software for the wireless card before you put in the wireless card inside the computer?  </s>
<s> no i installed the card first.  </s>
<s> ahhh, there could be the answer.  </s>
<s> with every wireless card i have installed, it has always been necessary to install the software first, then the hardware.  </s>
<s> so, lets try this: 1.) shut down computer and remove wireless card.  </s>
<s> 2.) start up computer without card.  </s>
<s> 3.) install wireless card software.  </s>
<s> when prompted--- 4.) shut down computer.  </s>
<s> 5.) install wireless card.  </s>
<s> 6.) restart computer.  </s>
<s> please let us know how that works.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> i tried to install software first, then card but still nothing, something about hardware problem in install and about something not in range.  </s>
<s> i on't know what the problem is, i had a connection in an apartment with walls in the way, and this place isn't any different, i wonder if i buy another modem,would that help or maybe the card got messed up during my move?  </s>
<s> i tried another card a g instead of the b, same linksys.  </s>
<s> is there something else i can do  </s>
<s> you will need to be much more explicit about the actual errors and messages displayed.  </s>
<s> it is almost impossible to troubleshoot without the actual messages.  </s>
<s> i'm sorry, but without more concise details, there is no way for me to go further at this time.  </s>
