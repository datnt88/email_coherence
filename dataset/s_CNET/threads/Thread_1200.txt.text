i was thinking of using an old hard drive as a slave to my new hardware and creating a dual boot system with it. i've run into problems with dual boot machines not recognizing the second hard drive. anyone know why this would happen? there isn't a seperate bios configuration per operating system is there?
there is a proper procedure for installing a second hard drive and creating a dual boot system. what computer model? what hard drive model number? what operating systems do you want to have installed?
we do a repair install to that install. it's a nutty thing that you have to deal with. even more nutty when you deal with windows versions prior to 2000. not busted, just coded that way. bob
i was thinking of installing linux on the second hard drive. i currently have windows 2000 server. haven't gotten around to upgrading that since i don't upgrade unless i am forced to upgrade. i built the pc myself. i'll need to post the specs when i get home since i don't know off the top of my head.
