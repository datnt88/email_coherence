i really want a lcd monitor to play games watch movies and stuff on my pc. i know lcd's can't compare to regular monitors such as refresh rate and stuff. but do you guys know what are one of the best lcd's out there that wont have ghosting while playing games such as counter strike and among other pc games. something that almost can match crt monitors.
i can suggest a sony 32in lcd that can be used on a computer and personal tv....
damn that big??? well i'm looking for more of gaming and watching dvd's and what not. games like counter strike. i'm looking for a good lcd that wont have ghosting and hopefully dead pixels which sucks if i get a couple of those. i dunno really, but i'm looking for 19 or maybe a little bigger than that. but a 32inch lcd?? probably to big. but how good is it for gaming?
this is a good lcd that you can play movies/games without ghosting.  it has a 4ms response time so it is perfect for your needs.
