i live in a fraternity and we set up a network that looks something like this: cable modem goes to a router (the router's wireless is disabled). this router then sends and ethernet cord to each floor and connects to a wireless router and sends a signal. now the problem is that only the router on the third floor seems to be connected to the internet, the other two won't. even when i plug my computer into one the problem routers i can't connect to the internet. on the problem routers the internet light is solid and not showing activity. does anyone have any idea of what could be wrong.
you didn't tell if it ever worked or if you tried it like i shared in post 17 of our forum sticky.
one the other floors, you need wireless &quot;access points&quot;. perhaps your other routers have the ability to act as such but it's a waste of extra time and may always be flaky. trade them in for aps and you'll be better off.
