<s> we are looking to buy a color laser printer to print our concert tickets.  </s>
<s> we are a non-profit organization with limited income.  </s>
<s> i want to find a printer that initially wont cost us a fortune but i would also like to find one that wont cost us a fortune to run. it needs to be a duplex printer that can handle about 1250 copies a month.  </s>
<s> does anyone have a suggestion?  </s>
<s> cheapest way to go would be a brother but the duplexer throws the kink in, typically cost goes up with any of them with duplexe.  </s>
<s> thanks for the tip! they are less expensive than other printers.  </s>
<s> has anyone used the brother hl-4040cdn?  </s>
<s> most of the reviews i have read for the hl-4040cn are pretty good but i can't find many reviews for the hl-4040cdn.  </s>
