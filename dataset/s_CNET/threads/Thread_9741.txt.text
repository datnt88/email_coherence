i'm in the process of upgrading my old p3 processor and i'm a bit confused. i have a p3 600 (coppermine), does that mean my motherboard is a slot 1? or a slot 370? thank you
it could be either. open the case and look. bob
it says 600eb/256/133/1.65v s1 can i safely assume that s1 means socket 1?
the form factor for me is a gimme. the slot one has a big ole brick unit for the cpu and the 370 is pretty square with the usual heatsink and fan on top. did you look? bob
it's pretty rectangular it has a heatsink, no fan though
to see what can be done, the make/model of the motherboard is needed to find what cpus can be fitted. it's rare to find a fanless p3. bob
