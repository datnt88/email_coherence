i have a 16g san drive, and the extra programs installed in it are absolutely infuriating. are there any large usb thumb drives around without that trash in them?
16gb, no extra programs...at least not that i recall. if it had any, i simply deleted them. in any case, why not simply delete the programs on your flash if you don't want to use them? last year i bought one of those cruze micro flash drives with the u3 software. simply reformatted it to wipe out the us software which was a waste of time. all flash drives can be reformatted to be &quot;plain jane.&quot;
so far as i can tell, the extra trash is in ram and cannot be erased.
the extra stuff is in &quot;rom&quot;, not &quot;ram&quot;.
