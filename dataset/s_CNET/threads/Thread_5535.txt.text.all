<s> hi! i have trouble finding software to my videocard beacuse i dont know what kind of videocard i have.  </s>
<s> i know its some kind of ati card, but not witch one.  </s>
<s> i have downloaded a couple of drivers, but none of them was right.  </s>
<s> is there somewhere i can find this out?  </s>
<s> look for markings on the board or #s on the video chip that you can run through google.  </s>
<s> you did not mention your os so i suspect it's not xp as it seems to know most ati cards though it sometimes calls the chipset wrong.  </s>
<s> if you don't have xp and have access to an xp machine, you can try to see if that pc can identify it. the risk of this is the &quot;found new hardware&quot; feature that could trigger xp to require reactivation.  </s>
<s> i'd pull the board first and check it.  </s>
<s> a genuine ati board will provide more than a third party offering, however.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> 1. right click your desktop, click properties, click settings, it says display: [your monitor and your graphics card] 2. everest home edition.  </s>
<s> i have come to love this program and it will tell you exactly what gpu you have.  </s>
<s> google it, free download.  </s>
<s> konny  </s>
