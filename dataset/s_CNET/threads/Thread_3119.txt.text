hello - i'm thinking of buying the samsung 244t widescreen lcd for my pc. i'm also buying a new pc and want to make sure everything's compatible. what will i need as far as a video card? i know that some pc games are compatible with 16:9 ratio, but what about the ones that aren't? will they be stretched out or just normal size (4:3) on the screen - with black bars on the left and right of the screen? any help is much appreciated? thanks tim
if a display ain't wide enough, black bars appear along the top and bottom. if it's too wide, i'm sure black bars appear on the sides instead. as for a vid card, just check to see it supports widescreen resolutions (divide the numbers to see if you get the 16:9 ratio)
i run the  we work to find solutions for individual games. each game is different in it's support of widescreen. some games won't support it, and you will have the option of stretching or black bars. those that do support a non-stretched resolution, might not have a perfect fov. if your montior supports 1:1 or aspect scaling, then you won't have any problems. if not, nvidia offers this option in their drivers. ati does not. you won't see a widescreen res in your driver list until you hook up a widescreen monitor. they should appear automatically. if you're looking for a res that isn't there, you'll have to add it manually. you can use a tool called powerstrip to do that. i believe you can also add custom res in the driver panel in nvidia's driver set.
i have posted a query along the same lines but i now wonder if its a coincidence that the vast majority af tft's are standard 4:3 aspect. perhaps widescreen is more bother than it's worth as there are few unknowns about standard monitors.
