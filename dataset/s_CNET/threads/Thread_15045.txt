(this never used to happen before) then it went on to detect 2 sata drives. (this is normal... used to happen before) then it gave me an option to start windows normally, or in safe mode, last known good config, blah blah... the problem is, whatever option i choose, my comp just restarts... i dun even get the windows xp splash screen. then the whole process is repeated again, till i reach the screen with the windows start up options and again whatever i choose, the computer restarts. if i try choosing safe mode, it does its usually stuff in loading some files, it reaches up to some point, and the screen goes blank and it restarts. there was nothing wrong with this computer before. i mean it was in tip top shape. viruses in check, no addware, spyware. nothing of the sort. just plugging in my friends ide hard drive, caused all this mess. i'm sure nothing serious happened. probably some sort of setting somewhere messsed up. i just dunno what, and how to change it. can anyone help me out with this? thanks.
