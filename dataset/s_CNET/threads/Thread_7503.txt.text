i recently had a new hard drive added to my computer. the old drive was left in as a slave drive, and a new installation of windows xp home sp2 was installed on the new drive. the first thing i did when i got my machine home was to make sure windows was totally updated. since then, none of my usb devices will work. when i plug any of them in, the computer will make the usual &quot;bling-blong&quot; sound, but nothing else happens. it makes the usual &quot;blong-bling&quot; sound when i remove a device. i am currently using (well, attempting to use) a microsoft wireless optical mouse 2.0, a brother mfc 5440cn, and a tv tuner device. none of them work at all. i tried to go into the device manager and update the drivers on the usb controllers, but windows was unable to find an updated driver. so, i uninstalled the devices and re-booted the machine. i then went into the device manager and updated the drivers on the &quot;unknown devices&quot; that were there. this worked and windows successfully installed drivers for all six entries in the device manager. however, after rebooting, i am still having exactly the same problem. there was no change at all. all of the drivers for the hardware are up-to-date and have been installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled. i am running out of options! does anyone have any advice? thanks for your help! =) i have a p4 2.5g 750mb 160gb with windows xp home sp2.
microsoft doesn't install drivers for all this plus... there may be some motherboard driver package that needs installing. try to remember how you installed windows last time. bob
you probably need to install the mobo/chipset specific drivers. visit your mobo mfg's website or your chipset mfg website and you should be in business.
