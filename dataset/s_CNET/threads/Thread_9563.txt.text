right now i have a hp desktop that is 7+ yrs old. pent 4 2.53ghz w/512 mem. i'm going to attempt to build a pc, and have gotten some advice so far from friends, but want to make sure i buy the right things, ect. i wanted to stay under $400, and i after adding it all up, i came to $293, which is much easier atm, and leaves room to buy a better graphics card later to replace the onboard one. plz tell me what u think. case: power up 5511 atx mid-tower case w/450watt power supply $50 cpu: intel pent dual-core e5200/2.5ghz w/fan and heatsink $83 mobo: intel dg35ec mobo w/onboard sound and video $80 hd: seagate barracuda 7200.10 sata 80gb hard drive $35 mem: kingston 2gb (2x1gb) 240pin ddr2 sdram ddr2 800 (pc2 6400) dual channel kit desktop mem. $20 cd drive: lite-on plds 52x dc-rw/16x dvd-rom combo drive $25 total: $293 (all prices are from newegg or tigerdirect) i will use my current monitor until i can afford to upgrade it. i have a 300gb external hd that i keep most files on. i have a decent keyboard/mouse. 90% of this computers usage will be for mmogaming. am i forgetting anything or is there anything that is incompatible? ty for your help =)
get a good fan and oc the e5200, awesome oc'er
get a mobo based on intel g41/43/45 chipset instead. the built-in x4500 graphics are faster than the g35 graphics. $65 asrock mobo:  a 160gb drive is only $7 more.
