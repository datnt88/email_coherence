<s> this usually doesnt happen with computers but i am stumped.  </s>
<s> last night my pc died on me, no lock up or warning, just turned off.  </s>
<s> when i went to turn it back on, and in every attempt there after, i get power for all of 1 second.  </s>
<s> the fans fire up, disk drives light, and thats it.  </s>
<s> i replaced the power supply not too long ago but it has been working fine for about 3 months.  </s>
<s> the mother board is getting power, when switched &quot;off.&quot;  </s>
<s> so im guessing it is not that.  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> xp p4 200mhz 512 self built power supply is 550w did not smell any burn up.  </s>
<s> also...i do not get an indicator beeps, and if i try the process immediately...nothing happens.  </s>
<s> when faced with a dead as a doornail system i strip it down to 4 parts.  </s>
<s> 1. motherboard.  </s>
<s> 2. cpu plus hsf (heatsink/fan).  </s>
<s> 3. power supply.  </s>
<s> 4. speaker.  </s>
<s> no case, no ram, no extra cables.  </s>
<s> just those four pieces on a square of non-conductive cardboard.  </s>
<s> i use a jumper to power it up and hope to beeps.  </s>
<s> power down.  </s>
<s> if i get beeps i can add a minimum amount of ram and try again... more beeps is good.  </s>
<s> power down.  </s>
<s> a video card and hopefully more beeps and a display output.  </s>
<s> i then move that back to the case and check that no metal standoffs are where they shouldn't be.  </s>
<s> if you can't get beeps with the 4 items above, then you have narrowed it down to those 4 items are either dead or grossly misconfigured.  </s>
<s> happy hunting, bob  </s>
<s> ok, now if anyone is an optimist out ther i could use some smiles.  </s>
<s> no beeps, only the same on/off one second burst.  </s>
<s> with no smell of burning, but with the recent replacement of a burnt up power supply, which should i suspect. the motherboard is an asus p4b533, and the cpu is pentium 4 2.0, not overclocked  </s>
<s> if not.  </s>
<s> do it.  </s>
