i have been given an old acer pentium 166 mhz that i am fixing up for my 3 yr. old. i would like to upgrade the 32mb of memory which is 72 pin non-par fpm. i have some edo,will this memory work?
i can't give a 100% answer. however, you can install and see if it works or not, it won't hurt the system thought it may hang. if it works, then ok, if not, then you have to pick one type then find similar fpm or edo of *all* same type. some systems you could mix types, but not all. if you can google for specs on that model# acer will give a more informed answer. good luck -----willy
the fpm and replace all with the edo. the only other difference is the fpm is 70ns and edo is 60 ns.
