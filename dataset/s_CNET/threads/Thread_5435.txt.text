basically what is happening is that my usb ports are not working. it seems to work for the printer but if i was to put anything else it it it fails to work. could you please help me? i really need it to start working soon!
usb ports may not work for some devices until we install the driver for the device. and many usb 2.0 hard disks don't work in usb 1.1 ports. since there is nothing to work with in your post, try  bob
...why would a usb port work for my printer but not for my webcam? i bought a new webcam thinking it had something to do with it, but it still doesnt work....
no os, machine or more mentioned. let's say you are using microsoft windows 95. i can then proceed to tell you the video streaming support (api) is absent in that usb implementation. the lack of information on your part makes a discussion sputter and die. bob
