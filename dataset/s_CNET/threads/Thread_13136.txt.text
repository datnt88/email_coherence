i can install my my book with the usb cable but can not get the system to recognize the firewire setup. if i use both, the my book is recognized as a usb device. any help will be incredibly appreciated. thanks mark turik
if it works there, then your pc has a problem. if not, then return the unit. bob
i appreciate the thought. i will try the my book on another pc just to see. dont know why i didnt think of that before. mark turik
