somebody please help!!! my computer will not de-fragment!! i have no idea why.....
the most common cause for this is there is one or more pgms. already running in the bkgrd. doing thier tasks, thus the defragger repeats when in conflict. i suggest you hit the clt+alt+del keys once and see what's running, and kill the tasks not required(leave ms ones) for the time being and allow the defragger a chance to finish. you can also, check the &quot;startup&quot; of files to see if you can disable during such defragging. if your systemtray is more than 3-4 icons present, check them to disable, try one at a time for best operation. check into areas... good luck -----willy
you didn't note the os plus what hardware issue you feel may be affecting this. hint: you posted in the &quot;pc hardware forum.&quot; for windows 9x/me this article covers it all -&gt;  this applies to defragmenting as well as scandisk. what i often see is any number of responses that contain bits and pieces of what's in this article, but why not have it all. in closing, if you feel this is a hardware issue, tell about what hardware issue you have. bob
turn computer on and while it is booting in black/white screen, keep pressing the f8 key until an option appears that offers safe mode. then run defrag. when finished, shut down and restart, and computer will boot normally.
hae you tried scandisk first?
