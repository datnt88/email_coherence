9736	12	576955	5383397	5383066	briegull	11/10/12 3:40 pm	1.352562e12	thank you!	your rationale behind apple is sound, and i hadn't really thought of it. i have been investigating, and most people around here who have kindles read books, period. i don't think the camera is too big a deal but maybe it is. i did find one woman who uses a kindle fire for all sorts of things, which means that if i do a presentation i should invite her to join me. so thanks, for understanding exactly what i was looking for. a few years back everyone here was saying everyone (even grandma) should get linux computers. i don't hear that often any more. the ability to understand that what you may want or enjoy isn't necessarily what everyone should get perhaps come with maturity and experience. thanks again!
