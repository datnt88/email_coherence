hey all, i'm going on clinical rotations and need to store my desktop for a year...any suggestions? it's an old dell 4100 running me. i don't know if i have time to back up all the files i'm interested in...
if you have no time to even store the &quot;important data&quot; what good is trying to store the system. basically, if storage fails for some reason, then data is gone. always think data first, then the h/w.. i suggest you wrap in orginal packing if available. if not, then a simple double bagging in plastic bags will do fine then store in closet. if you have access to descentant, use some. all this depends on the condition/enviroment of area of storage. tada -----willy
is to buy an external hard drive caseing and scrap your hard drive and make it an external. that way any important files you can take with you with out worrying too much about it going bad collecting dust. then with the rest of your desktop you can store in a dumpster or local recycleing center. or donate it for a tax break. or go office space on it's ass!! the possibilities are endless!!
