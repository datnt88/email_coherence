<s> hello! i have a wd external hard drive.  </s>
<s> it works well all the time.  </s>
<s> however, to my surprise, i could not open it yesterday.  </s>
<s> it only displayed this message: &quot;the drive is not formatted.  </s>
<s> do you want to format it?&quot; i don't know what is going on here. is it failed or corrupted? is it still possible for me to access the contained pictures, videos and documents?  </s>
<s> i know i should have backed up all of them.  </s>
<s> but, this drive is my backup drive.  </s>
<s> help please!  </s>
<s> please goto the &quot;storage forum&quot; find the sticky post. the uppermost post on that forum has much info and required details in *possible* rescue of your data.  </s>
<s> understand, any attempts may further reduce recovery of data, the choice is yours.  </s>
<s> also, i like to part that any critical data should be saved to cd/dvd/bd discs as a more safe storage method.  </s>
<s> practically all ext.  </s>
<s> storage media will fail in some way sooner or later, even if yours is a back-up it shouldn't be the sole backup, you now understand why.  </s>
<s> good luck tada -----willy  </s>
<s> data available elsewhere, then you should be able to format the external and later copy the data to it.  </s>
<s> otherwise i'd have to say data on the external wasn't backup.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> i am sorry!  </s>
<s> i am not sure whether it is failed because of your poor information.  </s>
<s> but, that also indicates that your drive and inner data may be still recoverable.  </s>
<s> in fact, &quot;not formatted error&quot; message is often caused by many reasons, such as hard drive damages, virus attack and even computer operating system problems, etc. so, i hope your problem is not so serious.  </s>
<s> plunge this sd card to your computer and download a data recovery program to take a chance.  </s>
<s> nowadays, many data recovery programs are designed for the user to process their inaccessible data recovery programs.  </s>
<s> so, you also could select some faithful drive data recovery freeware, such as recuva, testdisk and icare data recovery free, etc. just search on the internet and download a free one.  </s>
<s> note: before you begin to restore your data, you'd batter not save anything new on this drive in case of data loss.  </s>
<s> after data recovery process, you should back up your retrieved data on another computer and format this drive to make it work again.  </s>
<s> thank you for your replies.  </s>
<s> your replies helped a lot.  </s>
<s> now, i have restored all of my wanted data back!  </s>
<s> thank you!  </s>
<s> thanks for your detailed expatiation.  </s>
<s> now, i have tried your mentioned data recovery freeware and retrieved all of my wanted data back.  </s>
