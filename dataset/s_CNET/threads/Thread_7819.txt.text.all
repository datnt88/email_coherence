<s> hello, i recently purchased a wireless security camera system.  </s>
<s> it comes with it's own hub that captures the video and outputs it through a/v ports.  </s>
<s> i want to plug the a/v chords into my laptop so that i can record the video.  </s>
<s> a few questions i have is: 1. do a/v to usb adapters exist that would make sense in this situation?  </s>
<s> 2. do a/v to firewire adapaters exist?  </s>
<s> 3. what kind of software would i be looking at for recording this on a pc? mac? 4. are there any other setups i should consider?  </s>
<s> for example, can i simply caputre the video from a pc off the network?  </s>
<s> thanks for your help!  </s>
<s> that's called &quot;video capture.&quot;  </s>
<s> too many to list here.  </s>
<s> i'm surprised you were not flooded with options when you went shopping.  </s>
<s> as to the network, such would a documented feature along with how or else it can't.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> does &quot;video capture&quot; refer to capturing on the network?  </s>
<s> or capturing from a device?  </s>
<s> i have found plenty of freeware that can handle video from a device, but nothing that can capture it off the network.  </s>
<s> do you have any examples of these?  </s>
<s> thanks heaps!  </s>
<s> let's say i have some video capture device and it is set up to save one or so many hours in a file, then another and so on.  </s>
<s> said file is then &quot;shared&quot; on a network or off the network (your choice.) seems like you can do this?  </s>
<s> again, there are hundreds of video capture cards and even more software.  </s>
<s> it's like trying to find a dollar hamburger in l.a. bob  </s>
<s> bob. i'm on the rgiht track now.  </s>
<s> many thanks  </s>
