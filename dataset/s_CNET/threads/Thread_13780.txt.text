i have a dell xps 400 (new in 2005) that was shipped with an ati radeon x300 se 128mb hypermemory video card. it is incapable of showing my hd videos from my new 18 megapixel canon camera without the image &quot;jumping&quot; or &quot;stuttering&quot; on the screen. i want to purchase a new video card that will perform better and that my dell machine will be capable of using. i am currently running windows xp media edition version 2002 with sp 3, but i plan on upgrading to windows 7 professional after installing a new video card. the processor is an intel pentium iv, 3.0 ghz with 4gb of ram. can someone please recommend a good to high quality video card for me to purchase?
you've got a 375watt power supply that should be able to handle these cards. radeon hd 5750, about $155 radeon hd 5670, abut $110 geforce gts 240, about $110 but your power supply is 5 years old. it may not hold up well with a hd 5750 due to it's age. i also don't think the power supply can handle a gts 250 (about $140) because they draw too much power.
thanks for the help
