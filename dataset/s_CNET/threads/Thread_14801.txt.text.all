<s> i have an asus k55v series laptop with &quot;500gb hard disc drive storage as the sticker says&quot; as far as i can count is that also wrong and it has &quot;4gb of random acces memory as that same sticker says&quot; but if i check in cinfiguration --&gt; system and security --&gt; system i see 8gb of random acces memory and a intel core i5-3230m processor clocked on 2.6ghz so actually only the processor is the same as on the sticker :s i have still warranty and the laptop runs on windows 8 in 64 bit many thanks for your help  </s>

<s> you might want to check disk management to see how the total space is allocated.  </s>
<s> you've already accounted for 258gbs and 186gbs...that's 444gbs....is there more free space or perhaps a hidden recovery partition somewhere?  </s>
<s> if yes....then you got what was advertised and maybe then some.  </s>
<s> recommend you verify the facts before losing more sleep or wasting more time.  </s>
