i am installing two dvd's in a new machine. a dvd rom and a dvd burner. the dvd rom was packaged with an audio wire. the dvd burner did not. the question is, when installing both devices, do i need an audio cable from both devices to the motherboard or just from the dvd rom to the motherboard?
i run the audio connection to the drive which i will play audiocds in. bob
set the drive's properties to &quot;enable digital cd audio for this device&quot;. good luck, click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about internet connections, and download free software. if you're reading this, thank a teacher. if you're reading this in english, thank a u.s. soldier.
