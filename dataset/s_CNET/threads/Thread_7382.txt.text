hello! i've been searching for the &quot;best&quot; cordless phone to replace the phones in my place and concluded that the new dect 6.0 phones would be the best. unfortunately, when i searched around, the only ones that i could find were: uniden (no headset jack!), ge (poor performance/design), and some unknown brand act or something like that (poorly made). may i please ask if anyone knows when and what models might be available in the usa? i've tried to look and search but can't seem to find any new information on upcoming availability! i'm sure every cordless phone maker would have several dect models out soon but there doesn't seem to be any announcements or information on that! how unusual. i need a replacement cordless phone pretty soon! thank you very much in advance! best,
look up philips.
but the philips dect cordless phone also doesn't have a headphone jack either - it looks like the philips one is simply a rebranded and cosmetically different one from the uniden. what's going on with all these dect phones? there doesn't seem to be many coming out!?!
i have just found your answer and it has a plug for an ear piece. the model numbers are uniden dect 1060, 1060-2, 1080, 1080-2.
may i please ask where you found the headset jack in the 2 uniden models you mentioned? i'm quite sure those 2 models do not have headset jacks. i just double checked yet again. please do tell. thx in advance!
