<s> i've been running an asus p4p800s-x mobo, p4 2.4c, saphire radeon 9600 pro, for a little over a week now with not a single problem.  </s>
<s> yesterday, while i was plugging in a game controller into the front usb port, i heard a loud pop sound just as the plug touched the front usb panel. the monitor went blank, but the computer fans still continued to run.  </s>
<s> i then smelled a strong burning plastic odor and quickly shut down the computer.  </s>
<s> i checked everything out and all seemed to be okay, so i thought maybe my monitor fried.  </s>
<s> i tried to turn on the computer and got nothing.  </s>
<s> no sounds, no lights, nothing.  </s>
<s> i pulled out the mobo and found a very small chip,(about half the size of a grain of rice) on the mobo which is burnt.  </s>
<s> it is black with some white powder residue on it. it also discolored the board a little.  </s>
<s> i tested the psu and it seems to work fine.  </s>
<s> what caused this to happen and how can i prevent it in the future?  </s>
<s> what are the chances that other components may have also failed as a result of this?  </s>
<s> that may be an unanswerable question.  </s>
<s> however, it is likely (though by no means certain) that the plugging in of the game controller is not co-incidental.  </s>
<s> first, replace the mother board, and come up with just memory, cpu/fan, ps, and motherboard.  </s>
<s> if you get the post single beep of success, add components 1 at a time and gradually put the machine back together.  </s>
<s> do not however add in the game controller.  </s>
<s> get a cheap usb card, and plug the game controller into that, or get another game controller, if it is bad, you don't want to fry another motherboard, now do you?  </s>
<s> consider replacing the usb receptacle on the case, as that may also be the source of a wiring fault.  </s>
<s> i had the same problem, except i plugged in a headset in the front audio input.  </s>
