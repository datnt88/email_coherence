i've got a 6yr old presario,windows 98. over the years i've installed 'turbotax' software programs for taxes. ever year the newer program i install pulls information from the previous years program. its now time for me to get a new computer and i want to install last years tax program onto the newer computer when i get it. i've seen these portable storage drive things that are about the size of a lighter advertised at 'staples'.....reasonably priced @ $30 area. i assume it plugs into my usb port. does anyone have experiance with these or know if these things would hold my whole tax program? i'm open to other solutions. thanks.
hold the largest turbo tax backup file i've ever seen some 20 plus times... bob
thanks for responding. can you tell me how to determine what size storage drive to buy? [i need to install the whole program, not just the data].i've tried to find the amount of space it requires by loading the program searching for details but don't see anything. there is no specifics on the set-up disc either. the portable storage drives advertised come in sizes of 256mb, 512mb, 1gb, etc.[the ones over 512mb start to get a little expensive]. thanks.
you would look at the backup file properties. my turbotax file is under 1 megabyte which is why i commented that the smallest usb drive will do this with ease many times over. bob
