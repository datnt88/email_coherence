i'm trying to download smart script gold (u.s version) and it tells me i have to buy winzip (30 bucks i don't have at the moment.) is there any way i can get winzip for free or is there any other way i can download this program completly free ? thanx
winzip will demo run indefinitely so far. and is a free demo. since i don't feel right about that, i use tugzip. bob
well it work on this particular program because when i go to run the program it says that &quot;winzip self-extractor.&quot; it's not giving me the option to open it. just the options to unzip or close and when i click unzip it's says &quot;winzip is not found on you computer.&quot; do you think i'll just have to go head and cough up the money for winzip or what ? thanx
just install the winzip freebie.
