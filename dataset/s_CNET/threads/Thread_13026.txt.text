winxp pro; pent 4; 512ram; the features of low-end web cameras ($20 to $50) and moderately priced ($50 to $100) appear the same. what features should i look for to have acceptable pictures over the net ?
the difference is mostly in the quality of the hardware. better lens and better sensor. a bunch of megapixels is not very useful. if it can handle 640x480, that's about tops. you can use a webcam on dial-up but it is not very satisfactory, especially if you are using voice too. a high-speed internet connection is very important for producing acceptable pictures over the net. ... .. .
any further suggestions ? thanks for your help regarding pixels -
