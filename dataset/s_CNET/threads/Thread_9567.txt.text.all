<s> 1.) make sure you actually created a second partition of 150gb...it's not automatically created.  </s>
<s> you can boot to your xp cd to verify this and create/delete partitions.  </s>
<s> 2.) 127gb is a standard limitation unless you install sp2, a free (but large) download from microsoft for all legitimate users.  </s>
<s> john  </s>
<s> i have service pack 2 installed if i reboot it then download sp 2 again will it recognize the rest of the hard drive?  </s>
<s> ill try it with the xp cd thanks  </s>
<s> to see if the motherboard can see the whole drive capacity.  </s>
<s> if it shows there, then windows can see it also, if you have sp2 installed.  </s>
<s> go to drive management and look there.  </s>
<s> go to: start control panel administrative tool computer management disk management right click on the box that shows 'unallocated' ...you can create and format the partition from there  </s>
