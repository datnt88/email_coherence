what would be the safe and high temp limits for a mb & cpu. my bio's has a feature that will shut down the computer if it reaches a certain temp. i have to set it in bio's. i plan to do a little overclocking on the graphic and cpu and want to play safe. intel dual core 3.4g processor 2 gb's ddr400 sdram memory ati radeon pro 9600 rv350 hp 21&quot; lcd flat panel
'safe' shutdown temps for a p4 would be: cpu temp 85c mobo temp 60c personally, i wouldn't waste the effort to overclock your cpu or video card. the p4d 3.4ghz is already hot-as-heck and only 1 step away from the fastest p4d so you'll have very little overhead and great potential for failure. as for the radeon 9600, you can get a much better card for $100. even overclocked, a 9600 can't approach the performance of a radeon x1600 or geforce 7600gs.
where in my post did you see i have a p4??? i have a: intel pent dual core 3.4 g processor 945 lga775
the 900 series is 2 pentium4 cpus on a single die.
here are my speedfan readings (how come you can't post pixs here???)
