i'm able to get the ssid's in the range using vbscript and i would like to know is there a way to get the list of sta's (ie) systems under each ssid's using vbscript. i'm not able to find any resources in the internet. anyone plz help me out. thanks in advance, baskaran
the code is possible but if i were to do this i wouldn't hamper my efforts and limit my language choice. if you want to get into this go look for wepcrack and such since the source is readily available. bob
thnx for ur reply i think u r asking me to refer to the open source wep cracking stuff. is there a direct vbscript or any other program sources available for listing the sta's under an ssid like a vbscript that i've got for listing the ap's. i mean to ask is there any official and diplomatic way in knowing the sta's without using the hacking and cracking stuff.... hoping for ur reply.... baskaran
reuse the code that determined the ssids and such. but no, i do not know of code that meets your requirements that is in your selected language and ready to use. i bet you'll have to find working source in any language and modify it to your needs. there is a fast way to cheat on this. if this was my system i could get the status page from my wifi router and it lists the currently connected clients. bob
