hi all. i am receiving a dell v313w tomorrow. i would like to know if i can print to it from a tablet at a friends house on one network (the printer being at my house on another wifi network). i am using win xp with services pack 3. many thanks
i'm going to write no you can't. here's a simple way to get around all the printer and network issues. print such to a pdf and then email the pdf to the friend to print out. bob
thanks for your reply, r.profit. so what is cloud printing then? i honestly don't know exactly but from what i understand it allows you to send a file to a cloud account such as gmail, which i have, and the printer will automatically print it instantly. may be i am wrong - or am i correct and it is just that my printer doesn't support cloud printing. i don't know.
since you can't set it up and am unsure about it all i offered a sure fire way to get printing. bob
hope you can return it if it doesn't meet your needs.
