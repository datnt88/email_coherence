i recently got a new pc and would like to put the hd from my old one in it. the new pc is running xp pro, the old one is win98se. is this possible?
for 99% of us, you set the old drive to cable select and plug that into the slave ide connection, add a power connection and boot up to explore your old drive's content. bob
will i be able to transfer files between the two? new he is ntfs, old is fat32.
just got the old hd out and there are only settings shown for master, slave and single?
ignore my last post. i have been doing some reading, cable select requires a special cable right? since my old drive has no cs setting wouldn't i just set them as master and slave? would this cause any problems? i don't mean to sound like an idiot but it has been 8-10 years since i have done this! somewhere i read that because one is ntfs and the other fat32 there might be problems? thanks mike
set-up the old hd as a slave
connected the data and power cables ...and go ! the question is what can you cable the old hdd to in the new system ? is the hard drive in the new system connected to the hard drive by a long skinny cable (sata) or is it connected to the hard drive by a wide flat cable (pata)? perhaps it would help if you identified new system's hdd...make and model number. vapcmd
