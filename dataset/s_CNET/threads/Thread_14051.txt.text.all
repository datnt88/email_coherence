<s> hi there.  </s>
<s> i have an old time built pc with an amd chip 575 i think its around that any way.  </s>
<s> i formatted the hard drive yesterday and since doing this the hard drive is no long reconized by the computer.  </s>
<s> can any body help pls.  </s>
<s> when you boot up the computer is the harddrive showing on the black and white bootscreen?  </s>
<s> how do you know the harddrive isn't seen anymore?  </s>
<s> what happens if you use the windows bootdisk and you get to the a: drive.......can you change to the c: drive?  </s>
<s> if you can, then the drive is seen and you can install windows as long as your bootdisk gave you cdrom support.  </s>
<s> need more info, please... toni  </s>
<s> the hard drive is only 12gb using windows xp home.  </s>
<s> i no its not there because on the black screen its not recorded and also in bios under hard ware its not there says not installed for hard drives.  </s>
<s> when putting boot disk in it says not c drive  </s>
<s> from view in the bios says to me: 1) a power cable is disconnected 2) a data cable is disconnected 3) the drive is kaput.... judging from the age you indicate, #3 is my choice.  </s>
<s> the hard drive worked in my second computer.  </s>
<s> after playing around in bios i managed to get it working so thanks any way.  </s>
