have verizon dsl on 2nd floor computer through wireless router connected to box with a cable. i run my old computer in basement with wireless b usb adapter from linksys. both machines work flawlessly. son brought home his box from college and we swapped it for old box in basement, plugged in adapter, windows detected it and we installed driver from it's cd. green light is on. device manager shows wireless adapter is working. problem: computer will not detect a wireless signal although we have searched many times. we have tried everything. at school he is on their high speed network with an ethernet cable. my home boxes run xp, he has media center edition. we're stumped.
what box? are you referring to the router, or the external modem?
all students at my son's u. have to have a program called aegis on their hd. it identifies the user and blocks access to the university network to others. we simply deleted the program and the in home wireless signal came in as strong as ever. thanks.
