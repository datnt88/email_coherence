i recently bought an emachines t6410, and i'm quite impressed with the power, especially for the price, but i'm planning on adding a new video card (  ), and adding 1 gig of extra ram. is the video card compatible (i'm pretty sure i have the pci express x16 slot), and what kind of ram should i look for? do i have to worry about static-electricity?
and people dont follow antistatic discharge basics neways...i would just suggest grounding urself by touching metal part of the case b4 installin the ram
