<s> hi! &lt;div&gt;i'm currently using a toshiba satellite p775 laptop for video editing, graphic design and coding.  </s>
<s> for my work i use illustrator, dreamweaver, photoshop, premiere pro and after effects. the satellite is fine, but it is slow, it gets stuck and its intel hd graphics is not enough for me, and i want a better graphics card.  </s>
<s> i think the best solution is to buy a decent desktop computer for the video editing and graphic design, and another little and portable laptop for the programming with enough power to work with photoshop and illustrator.  </s>
<s> can you recommend on good computers as specified above?  </s>
<s> thanks &lt;/div&gt;  </s>
<s> take a look at some of the box stores to see what is offered, there should be a lot of them out there.  </s>
<s> places such as office depot or staples would be good starting points.  </s>
<s> the new i-5 or i-7 7 intel or the amd quad core processor would do the job coupled with enough ram, 8 gb's or more, basic onboard graphics should be good enough, if not most have slots to input a stand alone video cards, should that be needed.  </s>
<s> if you want to do that stuff with any kind of speed your looking for an i7 with at least a mid range video card.  </s>
<s> i suppose a high end amd would also function......think cores.  </s>
<s> why the video card? the editing progs will try to shift some of the work to the gpu.  </s>
<s> deals they show now as another good place to look.  </s>
<s> many of them are 'customizable' and offer optional video cards, bigger faster hdds, etc., how much ram do you have in the toshiba ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
