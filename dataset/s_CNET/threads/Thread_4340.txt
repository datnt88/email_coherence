9898	4	565151	5320988	5320926	yazirarafath	6/9/12 3:50 pm	1.339257e12	i am ready	i agree with you that building a server is more expensive than setting up individual pcs. but, i wanna do it in this way. so, please help me.
9898	5	565151	5320997	5320988	r. proffitt	6/9/12 4:00 pm	1.3392576e12	remember we have to use thin clients.	i can only guess you've not learned that there is no such server made today. that is, once in awhile you get the new person that thinks you can hang display, keyboard and mouse on some server and make it all work. they usually get upset there is nothing less than 2 times the cost of a pc. so here's the company and the products.  so there you go. citrix on the server and hdx thin clients. done. i wonder still if you were so new you expected no client hardware. bob

9898	7	565151	5321040	5320997	yazirarafath	6/9/12 8:04 pm	1.33927224e12	that was a geek to me	omg! i didn't expect such a setup. it is easy and economical for me to setup individual pcs rather than setting up thin clients and stuffs. i thought i could build a big size cpu with some extra vga outputs and usb ports for my project. so, i am going to set up some vertical desktop cpus, so that i can make a compact setup. anyhow, thank you for your kind information.
