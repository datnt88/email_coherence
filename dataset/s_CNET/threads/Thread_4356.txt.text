my dvd burner on my computer is a pioneer dvr-106a. the fastest for dvd-r's is 4x. i'm running winxp and using nero to burn it. i have used generic blank dvd-r's in the past which works very well, but i ran out so i got new ones which are memorex dvd-r 16x. firmware for the burner has been updated. when i burn an dvd iso image onto the blank dvd-r, nero does it without errors. but when i look at the disc that i just burned (through windows/mycomputer/drive), it says it is a cd instead of a dvd and it has 0 free space/0 used space. my guess is my pioneer burner is too old to work with a 16x (even though i thought a firmware upgrade would have fixed it), but i dont want to throw $100 at a new burner if i dont have to. can anyone tell me what is wrong?
maybe you are not in the states with newegg.com or geeks? that drive sounds years old. i'd go back to the media and firmware that worked. bob
since you've updated the firmware the next thing to check is your burning software. check your nero and update it if necessary. make sure that it isn't bumping into the native xp burning capabilities. when you check the drive in device manager is it showing up as a dvd? can you record other types of dvds to it fine or are you just having a problem with this one iso?
