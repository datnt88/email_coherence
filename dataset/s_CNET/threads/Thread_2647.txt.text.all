<s> i use two devices.  </s>
<s> one is a simple cd/dvd reader and the other a burner. the burner type depends on your needs.  </s>
<s> one reason for this is so disks can be duplicated by copying directly to the burner and bypass the need to copy to the hd first.  </s>
<s> i't just my personal choice.  </s>
<s> with dual layer dvdrw drives under 99 bucks (much less) i can fit one of those and do-it-all.  </s>
<s> since a dvdrom drive can do all a cdrom can do and more, that may be in the second bay for easy cd dupes.  </s>

<s> my experience tells me that a simple cdrom drive is much more capable of reading scratched or otherwise &quot;damaged&quot; disks than a writer or a combo.  </s>
<s> i find that utilities like cdr diagnostics, iso buster etc are able to handle a wider range of the so called dead cd's in a simple cdrom drive than in other combined drive/writers.  </s>
<s> as far as dvd's go, i'm not ready to make any observation as of now.  </s>
<s> i've found cdrw drives to be more adept at reading so-so cds.  </s>
<s> my experience with the newer dvdrw drives is &quot;not enough time yet&quot; to write if i feel the same for them.  </s>

<s> i want to take this time to thank everyone for their comments.  </s>
