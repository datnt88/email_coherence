<s> looking to purchase a quality wireless printer but hear alot about problems with setting them up.  </s>
<s> can you recommend a wireless all in one that is good for home use.  </s>
<s> most of the consumer models are 2 year devices so is that quality?  </s>
<s> or are you going for some office version that gets you a few more years?  </s>
<s> dependable for at least two years use, easy wireless set up as i'm not that great with technology, will be used to support three home computer/laptops, used primarily by my two children, college/highschool, was looking at a canon at best buy for around 99 dollars.  </s>
<s> 99 buck printers usually make it to 2 years on average.  </s>
<s> so while i give the nod to hp, other makes seem to fair well at 2 years.  </s>
<s> be honest.  </s>
<s> at 99 bucks there is almost no money for quality components.  </s>
<s> it's all just plastic and cardboard and something that will never be repaired.  </s>
