here are some details about my computers: computer 1: harddrive c: drive pioneer dvd-rw d: drive works without problem. computer 2: harddrive with 2 partitions: c: and d: cd rom e: works without problem. the problem: swap the cd drive and dvd drive from the 2 computer. after the swap, computer 1 with the cd drive still works fine. computer 2 with the dvd drive doesn't work. device manager can see the drive and say it is working corrrectly. nero can see the drive and burn dvd. windows on the otherhand won't let me access the drive. i do not see a e: drive. when i click my computer, i only see a c: and d: which are my 2 partitions from a single harddrive. there is no e: drive for my dvd drive. desperately need help. thanks.
run tweakui and see if any drive letters are hidden. bob
tweakui shows no drive is hidden. also if the drive is hidden by windows, then why did my old cd-rom drive worked?
so far you've only noted explorer is hiding it. try this. if you think it's e:, put in a cd with data on it and open the command prompt.... type dir e: press enter and tell what happens. try d:, f: etc... bob
any softwares that access the drive with a letter won't see it. dvd shrink, etc.... only nero can. nero access the drive directly. any other ideas? thanks.
as it stands i can't tell if you tried the dos commands. many will not do this since they are fearful of the command line. as such, you get to take it to the repair shop. bob
