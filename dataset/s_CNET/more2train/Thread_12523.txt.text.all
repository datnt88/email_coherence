<s> i have been transferring files over to my new computer and i made some new folders just for my turbo tax info and some very important pictures.  </s>
<s> now i need to reuse it ( it's already filled up) so i can finish up.  </s>
<s> how in the world to i overwrite, erase or otherwise reuse this thing?  </s>
