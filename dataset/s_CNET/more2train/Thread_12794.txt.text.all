<s> assigning ip addresses to the two pc's.  </s>
<s> as you know all pc's have an ip address, like a phone number or home address.  </s>
<s> they all are different.  </s>
<s> most ip address are dynamic, meaning they change every day.  </s>
<s> that way it is harder for spyware, etc. to catch on.  </s>
<s> but some places need a solid ip address, like servers.  </s>
<s> people are always accessing websites and it would be very difficult if google's ip address changed ever day.  </s>
<s> might be a bad example, but you get the point.  </s>
<s> to &quot;renew&quot; your ip address: start, settings, network connections.  </s>
<s> double click your active connection and click repair in the support tab.  </s>
