i have a 30 gig hd (ide) that is used for my business. 
all of my work is done through a server so i dont have much on the hard drive. 
but when i went to do updates for my windows 2000, i discovered my hard drive said full. 
so it was reformatted and reinstalled windows 2000. 
now it is showing 3/4 empty. 
can you tell me or explain what caused this and how to know next time to check to see if it is really full and not have to reformat??? it didnt need to be defraged either. 
checked all(maintenenced) things before reformatting. 
1.8 processor, 512 ram 
try the computer help forum at 
no having enough empty space for use as a scratch pad during installs. 
search for hat issue.
