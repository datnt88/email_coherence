<s> i recently read about this tablet pc by wipro called e.go so i checked out its website @ as well.  </s>
<s> and it looks amazing. the screen rotates 180degrees, the colour is really nice and it has a stylus as well.  </s>
<s> but what i want to know is - is it a good laptop for a young business professional?  </s>
<s> and how much is it for?  </s>
<s> any information on this laptop would be really helpful.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> the initial reviews and hands on use are coming up short.  </s>
<s> while i'm sure there is a market for tablet pcs that market has been attempted some dozen times with too many dead bodies of company to say that it's finally here.  </s>
<s> initial reviews often write &quot;clunky&quot; when you see windows icon mouse pointer (wimp) interfaces.  </s>
<s> for tablets it's different enough that you don't want wimp.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> see here...  </s>
