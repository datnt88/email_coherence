athlon, win 98se... my computer suddenly won't turn on... no lights, no beeps, nada. 
all connections checked, all plugs plugged. 
any ideas on what to check for...? thanks! 
i would check the power supply. 
take it out and see if it powers up on its own. 
or try a working power supply in your pc to see if it boots up. 
thanks for the help... turned out to be the mob oh well... wanted to upgrade anyway, just not this soon!
