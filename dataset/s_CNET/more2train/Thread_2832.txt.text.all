<s> i am wanting to build/buy a pc so that i can watch movies and tv shows on my tv and living room.  </s>
<s> any recommendations on what specs i will want to have on the machine and where to find such a product?  </s>
<s> thanks, jeff  </s>
<s> i have started to gather the parts to build my own media pc. the build i am considering will cost me under $400 which can be built for less.  </s>
<s> my pc will be placed into a gaming pc case, $50, that will not be located near the tv. a htpc case may cost a little more. the motherboard that i will be using has built-in graphics with hdmi,dvi,vga and digital audio outputs, $80, so i will not need to buy a graphics card. the processor is an amd athlon iix3 processor, $80, but a dual core processor is more than adequate for a htpc for around $60. i will have a 1tb hdd, $50, at a minimum you may want a 500 gb hdd. the ram i will use is ddr3 2 x 2gb, $40, 2 gb of ram is more than adequate for a htpc and the cost would vary depending on your components and may be less. the optical drive i chose is a dvd/cd burner/rom multi, $17. if you wanted a bd rom or burner it could be as high as $100. the power supply will cost me $30, for a 460 watt ps , dependent on your system a higher or lower wattage ps can be used.  </s>
<s> and at last, the operating system can be free, such as a linux os ubuntu, or as little as $100 for windows 7. i am not a computer geek, nor have i built computers in the past.  </s>
<s> i have been researching this info for the last month and been watching quite a lot of how to videos on youtube.  </s>
<s> you will need to pay a lot of attention to which components are compatible with each other, and that determines the cost.  </s>
<s> my favorite websites for parts are newegg and amazon.  </s>
<s> there are several free programs to obtain hd content, such as &quot;miro&quot; and free programs to categorize and display your video/movie content such as xbmc.  </s>
<s> and if you have windows 7 then it should come with windows media center.  </s>
<s> you could also splurge on a radio frequency remote to work with your htpc.  </s>
<s> if you have specific questions on my build, or more questions on building your own rig, then please don't hesitate to post, or email me directly.  </s>
<s> i hope this has been helpful.  </s>
<s> i found a refurbished hp/compaq evo at i believe overstock.com.  </s>
<s> it had a pentium processor, a 40 gig hd, half a gig of ram, a dvd drive (useless for this application), and xp pro.  </s>
<s> i upped the ram to one gig, installed a d-link wireless g pci card, and connected it to my sony 55&quot; sxrd with a vga monitor cable.  </s>
<s> powered it up, found my network, and voila.  </s>
<s> i believe i spend about 150 for the pc, and in total about 200 bucks.  </s>
<s> oh, i bought a wireless keyboard and mouse for about 30 bucks.  </s>
<s> so make it 230 bucks total.  </s>
<s> i can stream anything from anywhere.  </s>
<s> you don't need a lot of bells and whistles.  </s>
<s> that is a great solution to jmf4x9 question.  </s>
<s> i have not thought of using a refurbished pc as a htpc.  </s>
<s> from what you described it had to have either on-board graphics or a graphics card.  </s>
<s> kudoos, great solution at a great price.  </s>
<s> i will use your idea on using a d-link wireless g pci card thanks for your post  </s>
