<s> hi there i'm hoping someone can help me with a very annoying problem i recently found.  </s>
<s> there i am enjoying myself playing a game and then the monitor suddenly goes back to the desktop.  </s>
<s> it happens with all the games i've been playing and it happens every 10 mins or so.  </s>
<s> ran a virus scanner but it's still happening. the monitor is a videoseven 17&quot; tft panel and the graphics card is a 9600 pro.  </s>
<s> cheers  </s>
<s> that requires your input or you're hitting alt-tab during gameplay by mistake.  </s>
<s> roger  </s>
<s> the games were mouse driven so cant be alt-tab during gameplay and to tell you the truth i wouldn't know how to check if another prohram requires input.  </s>
