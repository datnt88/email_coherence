<s> i am most likely going to receive the rest of my computer parts this coming monday.  </s>
<s> so that i do not waste any time later, can someone please tell me how to replace the stock fan on an evga 7800gt?  </s>
<s> this is a picture of it: do i take the entire black thing off?  </s>
<s> or do i just take the black frame off, take out the fan, and put it back on?  </s>
<s> i am planning on using the following fan: thank you.  </s>
<s> the fan that you want to replace is pretty good for the card, but keep in mind that graphic cards these days demand huge amounts of power, thus creating huge amounts of heat.  </s>
<s> if you want to keep your video card stable and keep it cool, then i suggest getting a water cooling system for your pc, and a water block cooler for your graphics card.  </s>
<s> you can find some good deals at or good luck!  </s>
<s> at the moment, i cannot afford water cooling.  </s>
<s> my power supply is also at the bottom of my case, so if it leaks, there will be a big problem.  </s>
<s> am i correct in assuming that i have to unscrew the black frame off of the graphics card?  </s>
<s> would that damage anything?  </s>
<s> as for damage, well, be careful.  </s>
<s> roger  </s>
