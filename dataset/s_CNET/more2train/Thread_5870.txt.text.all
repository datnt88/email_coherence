hello, i am looking to buy a new desktop and i was wondering if i should buy a area-51 7500 or dell 710 h2c. 
i am an extreme gamer and is looking for performance, so if any one could tell me which one i should get and why please tell me because i am on the fence with this because i like the fact the the dell is over clocked, but the alienware has a newer motherboard and faster ram and i don't know which one to chose.thx 
i personally prefer the dell 710 h2c. 
but i thought i might recommend this website. 
its brilliant and not too expensive for custom built computers. 
why if you don't mind me asking? 
they are pretty well matched and both pretty much offer the same but i prefer the look of the dell more. the dell is more expensive but the area-51 is more customizable.
