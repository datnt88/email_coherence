<s> total newbie to wireless here.  </s>
<s> just got a laptop with intel pro/wireless 2011b lan pc card that is supposed to give my laptop wireless capability.  </s>
<s> questions: 1. will this card work ok for hooking up to hotspots while roaming? 2. does it work both 802.11b as well as 802.11g modes?  </s>
<s> you said that you hot a intel pro/wireless 2011b lan pc card more on your wireless card here you will have wireless capabilities.  </s>
<s> you will have the b capabilities, meaning your connection speed will be slower than a g connection.  </s>
<s> i found this and it might help to explain things better. the 802.11b wireless networking standard was the first widely available wireless networking solution that users could buy; the vast majority of public wireless spaces, including coffeehouses and restaurants and the like, use the 802.11b standard.  </s>
<s> it uses the 2.4 ghz frequency for communication, and the fastest speed an 802.11b user can theoretically have is 11 mbps.  </s>
<s> the 802.11a and 802.11g standards both offer a higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 mbps.  </s>
<s> however, nearly half of that is used for routine communication between your computer and the wireless access point it's communicating with, not for transfer of your data requests.  </s>
<s> 24 mbps is the highest speed that wireless cards are required to support. the 802.11a standard uses the 5.5 ghz frequency, a signal which is less used by other devices (a bonus for wireless network users) but the signal strength drops off more quickly as you go farther from the access point.  </s>
<s> however, because there's less interference, it may be easier to design good 802.11a coverage than 802.11b or 802.11g coverage in a given area.  </s>
<s> all in all, though, 802.11a is currently the least common type of wireless network installation.  </s>
<s> the 802.11g standard shares the 2.4 ghz frequency with the 802.11b standard, but 802.11g provides the higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 mbps.  </s>
<s> since they share the same frequency, many networking cards that support 802.11g also support 802.11b.  </s>
<s> this is good for users who travel from network to network, since 802.11b is still the most commonly available type of wireless networking.  </s>
<s> however, having a user with an 802.11b card in an 802.11g network slows the maximum speed of all the wireless network's users to the 11 mbps 802.11b standard.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>
<s> rick  </s>
<s> it helps a lot.  </s>
<s> thanks for the info.  </s>
<s> looks like i'm going to get another card that will work both the 802.11g and 802.11b modes.  </s>
