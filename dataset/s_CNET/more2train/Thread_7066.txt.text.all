<s> i have been looking into getting a wireless g pc card (not the at&t/phone carrier ones, the netgear and linksys ones).  </s>
<s> i know that the pc cards boost your bandwith and help you to get a better internet connection.  </s>
<s> now, i've noticed that these handy gadgets can be very expensive.  </s>
<s> does anybody know a good, not pricey pc card that works great?  </s>
<s> my laptop's internal works very nicely.  </s>

<s> my laptop's internal is good for at home, but i travel around a lot.  </s>
<s> i just wish that my laptop's internal had a better connection....  </s>
<s> notes an hawking unit that has an replaceable antenna.  </s>
<s> arm yourself with that and pick up a better antenna too.  </s>
