<s> i have one of the above printers. the scanner has failed.  </s>
<s> on opening up it was obvious that one end of the connecting wire to the slim flourescent light tube has broken off. the local epson agents refuse to supply me with a spare and instead want the price i can buy a new printer, to do what they call a repair job.  </s>
<s> anyone know where i can source a new light at a reasonable cost?  </s>
<s> the issue here is simple.  </s>
<s> stocking spare parts, issuing manuals and giving (free) support costs more than a new unit.  </s>
<s> some revolt against this but there is a second hand parts market on ebay for those that want to try replacing a part.  </s>
<s> do not bother asking the makers for parts on printers under a few hundred bucks.  </s>
<s> you'll waste your time.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> if you look on ebay you can find most parts for any printer out there in the form of that same printer.  </s>
<s> just make sure to ask the seller if the part you need is working.  </s>
