when i plug my new flash drive into a usb port it shows up ok as a removable drive but when i try to access the contents, i get the msg &quot;device not ready&quot; apparently the computer cannot read the drive. 
any suggestions or help would be appreciated. 
i forgot to include that i am running winxp home sp2 
while i would try the stick on another machine to see if it's a good one, the lack of machine details as well was if you tried it on the rear usb ports could help.
