i have a question. 
is it better to have a weaker graphic card paired up with a fast cpu for gaming performance, or a nice graphic card paired up with slow cpu. which will have an edge for gaming, and basically any other things??? 
either way, its bad. 
fast cpu with slow gpu will have ok loading times, but the worst graphics. 
slow cpu with fast gpu will look pretty good, but will be so laggy.. how about an okay cpu with an okay gpu? 
3200+ with a 6600? 
cheaper, you say? 
3000+ with a x300 cheaper?!?! 2800+ with a 6200 
i would say go with amd 3000+venice and 6600
