hi, since i updated my divx codecs recently i have noticed when playing movies via power dvd 5 that the screen sticks for about a second and then carries on prefectly for a while and then does it again. 
this happens 2 or 3 times through the whole movie (this is dvd format and other movie formats as well like wmv and mpeg) when i play the same movie via my windows media player i never have this problem. 
any help why this happens and how i can fix this? 
your post contained notes about software. 
what hardware issue is here? 
bob 
i'll post it in the right forum, sorry
