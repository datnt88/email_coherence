<s> hi, since i updated my divx codecs recently i have noticed when playing movies via power dvd 5 that the screen sticks for about a second and then carries on prefectly for a while and then does it again.  </s>
<s> this happens 2 or 3 times through the whole movie (this is dvd format and other movie formats as well like wmv and mpeg) when i play the same movie via my windows media player i never have this problem.  </s>
<s> any help why this happens and how i can fix this?  </s>
<s> your post contained notes about software.  </s>
<s> what hardware issue is here?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i'll post it in the right forum, sorry  </s>
