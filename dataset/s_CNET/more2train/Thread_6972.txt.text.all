just wondering because the sound blaster x fi only has 3 line outs. 
i'm guessing more than one speaker channel is encoded on a line and it is separated within the speaker system or receiver. 
well i'm pretty sure a speaker set for pcs could do it, not sure about a receiver. 
3 jacks? 
if it's jacks, then these jacks are probably in stereo (is my guess). 
of course! 
can't believe that didn't occur to me. 
one channel with have front l/r, another will have rear l/r, and the third will have center. the speaker system i guess will then decide what goes to the sub and what finally goes to the speakers.
