<s> last night i went to download the update for wow.  </s>
<s> anyway, my hard drive and fan seemed to be spinning very high.  </s>
<s> towards the end of the download, i heard a &quot;whirring&quot; or &quot;whistling&quot; sound, which sort of faded in, got a little loud, and then faded out.  </s>
<s> it did it about 3 different times, but hasn't done it since. is this an indication that something is wrong with my hard drive?  </s>
<s> or could it have been the cooling fan?  </s>
<s> my first hard drive that crashed would give me a clicking sound, but this was a high-pitched whirr or whistle.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> you need to remove side cover of system case and follow your ear.  </s>
<s> locate the source and proceed from there.  </s>
<s> fans typically are the source of much noise or new source of noise as they fail.  </s>
<s> observe the fans(any fan)for inbtermit operation.  </s>
<s> a good cleaning helps as always if not done in awhile.  </s>
<s> for the most part, hd omit a constant noise or lack of one(very quiet), so don't jump too quickly on a failing hd, but if apparent *backup* as a safety precaution asap, regardless.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> maybe,drive is about to go!!  </s>
