i'm looking at an asus f50 laptop and it says &quot;g120&quot; graphics but i'm not sure what this is...is it the rumored &quot;g102m&quot; product i saw a story about a while back? 
there's not such thing as a g120 in a netbook. the asus f50/f70 are laptops for folks &quot;on the go&quot;. 
the f50gx using nvidia 9400m graphics; the f50z using an ati gpu that's slightly faster. 
the &quot;g120&quot; (if it exists) is a rebranded nvidia 9500 (the &quot;g100&quot; is a 9400; and &quot;g130&quot; is a 9600. 
google gts 250 and you'll see that it's the new brand for the 9800gtx). 
there' nothing special or revolutionary in this lineup. 
essentially just another rebadging/shuffling of model numbers. 
although on balance i guess it makes mobile gpus more in line with the gtx series of desktop ones (and desktop replacement notebook gpus).
