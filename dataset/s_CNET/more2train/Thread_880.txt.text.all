<s> i have a lite-on dvd burner, but all programs have stopped recognising it.  </s>
<s> i have tried ashampoo and burnaware.  </s>
<s> the drive in question will read dvds and burn cds, but will not burn anything to dvd (i.e. backups, groups of files).  </s>
<s> i haven't added or deleted any programs over the period where it just stopped working. the drive is found in device manager as a dvd burner and is 'working properly'.  </s>
<s> i have updated the driver, unplugged the cable, reinstalled but nothing seems to work.  </s>
<s> i'm running xp/sp2.  </s>
<s> i have run nod32 virus scans, malwarebytes, spybot, adaware and nothing comes up as untoward so am thinking perhaps the drive is just dead, but i would've thought that it wouldn't play any disc or burn cds if that's the case.  </s>
<s> all help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> when i see this my steps are very simple.  </s>
<s> 1. do the old upper/lower filters removal.  </s>
<s> 2. cd/dvd lens cleaner.  </s>
<s> 3. put in a new drive.  </s>
<s> i'm sure someone would want to spend more than 15 minutes and try anything but item 3 but after thousands of drives you know the procedure.  </s>

<s> thanks bob, excuse my ignorance but what is the first step (upper/lower filters) and how do i do this?  </s>
<s> you could research this but i'm finding many get into a state of denial that it could be the drive.  </s>
<s> so here's 18 more things.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i had a similar problem after fooling around with a pirated nero 9 (may the cyber gods forgive me).  </s>
<s> eventually i had to uninstall it and ended up with a similar problem to yours.  </s>
<s> in checking for a solution i noticed that someone had reinstalled some media programme and solved this problem.  </s>
<s> i decided to reinstall the roxio 9 that came with my dell inspiron and bingo.  </s>
<s> my internal and external dvd/cd burners returned to the fold.  </s>
<s> hope this suggestion is of use to someone.  </s>
<s> gerry donaghy  </s>
