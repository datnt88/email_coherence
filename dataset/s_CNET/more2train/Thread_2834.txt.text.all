i need to upgrade my motherboard, cpu, and ram, there are so many to choose from i feel lost. 
my current system (for gaming only) windows 7 pro 64-bit unknown motherboard (2 pci-e slots, 2 ddr2 slots, am3 socket, built in sound, 4 usb 2.0 slots) amd phenom ii quad core 2.4 ghz sapphire radeon hd 6870 1gb 4 gb ddr2 ram corsair 750w psu cd/dvd drive 500 gb hard drive i am going to buy a new case, thinking about a full tower, and i want a new motherboard, cpu and ram, keeping my graphics, psu, hd, and dvd drive my budget is $250-$300 for the motherboard and cpu, i have no preference between intel or amd i dont know much about cpus as far as which is best, how many cores is optimal etc. thanks

my guess is since you current machine is leading edge there's not much to upgrade.

cpu.......i5-3570 mobo.....socket lga 1155. 
......atx size......not micro size. 
there's a bunch of them so pick one with the features you want. 
ram......8gb@1600 i doubt you'll go far wrong with that combo.
