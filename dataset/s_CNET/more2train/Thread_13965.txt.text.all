i've been using my cdrw long time ago, and today it start to asking me for the instalation of the drivers. 
showing a wierd window like above. 
any ideas??? 
i am not able to locate my external benq cd rewriter as a drive in &quot;my computer&quot; after properly installing it. 
what i mean is that when i connect the the device through my usb 2.0 port the computer detects that a new hardware( usb 2.0 mass storage device...disk drive) is found and it says it is ready for use but when i look for it in my comp. 
with the other drives i could not find it. 
so please tell me what to do. the operating system am using is windows xp 
i'm having a similar problem. 
still no resolution.
