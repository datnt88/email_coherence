i have a cnet modem with a cirrus logic md5620 chipset and im experiencing compatibility problems with hyper-threading 
is &quot; experiencing compatibility problems&quot; supposed to tell us what is happening? it really doesn't tell us anything however, what is happening. 
be very specific about what you are seeing. 
ht cpus are very new and as such you should be making the call to the system supplier to fix the issue.
