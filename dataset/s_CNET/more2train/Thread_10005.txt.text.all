<s> vivo=video in, video out the x1650 is capable of vivo but not all manufacturers implemented it.  </s>
<s> you need to check the specs of your card on your manufacturer's website to see if your card has vivo.  </s>
<s> if it does, your video editting/capture app needs to be able to support the x1650 as an input device.  </s>
