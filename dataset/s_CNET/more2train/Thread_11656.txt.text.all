<s> you can sift through to see that even from pc2700 to pc3200 it will be doubtful you could tell any real difference except in a benchmark.  </s>

<s> if you buy the faster memory it will still run at the speed of your fsb. that will not change with faster memory, so the speed will be no different.  </s>
<s> you would have to boost the fsb and that would require at least a processor upgrade (if not a motherboard upgrade as well).  </s>
<s> buying faster memory expecting to use it in the future is almost always a waste of time, because the memory requirements change every couple of years, and that memory will most likely not be fast enough for your next system.  </s>
