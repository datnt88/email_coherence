<s> i am a real organize freak and a thing that really bugs me are random files that have been installed on my second harddrive.  </s>
<s> when i double click on that harddrive it opens it up and brings me with the folders i have put on it, but also things that have been in stalled in the past.  </s>
<s> two of the folders on there are just a bunch of numbers.  </s>
<s> also there is a file called &quot;wutempt&quot;, and &quot;msdownload.tmp&quot; and four ffast files. is there anyway i can move these without hurting anything.  </s>
<s> your choice on the matter.  </s>
<s> wutemp was a windows update temporary directory.  </s>
<s> i've seen some delete it without harm.  </s>
<s> if your post has typographic errors, i'd show some neatnic tendency and offer a correction.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> lol k i just deleted teh ones with temp and i put the others in a folder.  </s>
<s> hopefully everything goes well.  </s>
<s> if you have ms office, take it's functions out of &quot;startup&quot; and turn off &quot;fastfind&quot; which is what the &quot;ff&quot; stuff usually is.  </s>
<s> also, if your os is xp, you can probably turn off system restore for drives you just use for storage because it won't save those for you.  </s>
