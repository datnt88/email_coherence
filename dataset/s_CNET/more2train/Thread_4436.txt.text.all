<s> hi guys, i have a western digital mybook 500gb harddrve which i mainly use to back up my music, videos and pictures.  </s>
<s> i connect it to my sony vgn-s2xp which runs win xp. recently it started acting up, not being recognised from time to time, but unplugging it and plugging it back would usually do the trick.  </s>
<s> i assumed that my usb ports on my laptop were just loose, which also sounded right for the &quot;disconnect&quot; happening whenever i was transferring lots of data from my harddrive back to my laptop. the harddrive would not be recognised anymore an dthe data transfer would be stopped.  </s>
<s> whenever it disconnected i needed a few tries to get it live again, and sometimes the harddrive was recognised but whenever i clicked on it, i got a message asking me to reformat it as its not the right format.  </s>
<s> (??) anyways, i was due to get a new machine anyway (was longing for a desktop) so got a sony tp1 last week (which runs on vista).  </s>
<s> when i connected the harddrive vista crashed.  </s>
<s> i then tried to connect the harddrive back to my laptop bt it keeps asking me to format the harddrive (if it actually recognises the harddrive). 2 questions: 1) i want to save my music collection (and myself from ripping all of it all over again, which took me months) and wondered if there is anything i can do to retrieve the data.  </s>
<s> i can't even access the directory in dos mode.  </s>
<s> 2) i only recently had the same problem with another 80gb harddrive of mine, which was about three years old so i assumed it was normal wear and tear.  </s>
<s> this mybook harddrive is less than 4 months old, so very strange.  </s>
<s> could it be some virus causing that?  </s>
<s> i ran antivirus and spywareblaster on it and nothing came up for it.  </s>
<s> how can i avoid it again next time? the harddrive stands around on a table most of the time, its not anywhere where it would be moved a lot, or could overheat.  </s>
<s> btw, i did read the comments about not using an external harddrive as the only backup.  </s>
<s> i never had any problems until recently but will avoid that in future.  </s>
<s> any help is appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> shareque  </s>
<s> putting the disk in another enclosure and see if it behaves as you expect.  </s>
<s> but as you still have warranty on it, it night be better to have it done by the shop where you bought it.  </s>
<s> they won't like if you come with it in parts and say it doesn't work anymore.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> was the only location for the data ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> as my music collection was over 60gb, and i only had 80 gb disc space on my laptop it just seemed a waste to keep it all on the laptop.  </s>
<s> i unfortunately formatted my 40gb ipod just recently and was able to retrieve only 20gb worth of music from it.  </s>
<s> so anything i can do to get the data back?  </s>
<s> any program?  </s>
<s> last time this happened with my old harddrive i ended up paying 200 ($400) to retrieve the data.  </s>
<s> i dont want to do this all over again.  </s>
<s> i am happy to pay for an effective program and be able to use it if this ever happens again.  </s>
<s> also, anyone has an answer why this keeps happening?  </s>
<s> could it be a virus which creates bad clusters?  </s>
<s> it depends on the cause of the trouble.  </s>
<s> if it's a hardware issue it's unlikely any recovery program will salvage your data, because it just can't access the disk.  </s>
<s> if it's just the data being a little bit damaged, it might work.  </s>
<s> a program to try: hope this helps.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> because hard disks fail.  </s>
<s> it's not a matter of if they will but when they will.  </s>
<s> often it takes costly events to get some to learn about backup.  </s>
<s> if you have one copy of something on a hard disk, then it's likely to go missing (someday.) in your case i would buy a new usb external drive case and move the drive over and hope it comes back.  </s>
<s> that 400 buck recovery fee was a bargain, but wouldn't a set of dvdrw (10?) hold what you can't lose for 20 bucks?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> this zar recovery program was great.  </s>
<s> i did not buy the full version but used the free trial one.  </s>
<s> i think its a great item and i'll proably spend the money for it anyway.  </s>
<s> it ran for like 3 days and required a few clicks in between as well, but after itw as done verifying the data, my harddrive was recognised again and i was able to retrieve some data.  </s>
<s> i lost some data, which is unreadable now, but lets say 75% of the data is there, which is great news! can only recommend that link.  </s>
<s> thanks mate.  </s>
<s> helped a lot!!!  </s>
