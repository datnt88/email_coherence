<s> my d-link di-614+ router went on the blinks two days ago.  </s>
<s> i have comcast cable and it completely stopped working along with my internet access to my laptop that feeds from my desktop pc's home network.  </s>

<s> i believe that microsoft has installed an automatic update regarding home networking on my pc during this time so this may or may not have been the culprit.  </s>
<s> i called comcast tech support and they couldn't assist me with the d-link router, which is understandable but they did assist me with my internet connection.  </s>
<s> they instructed me to connect the ethernet cable from my modem to my desktop pc. this only solved the internet connection problem.  </s>
<s> i will call d-link tonight to speak to a live person and have them walk me through the home network set-up again.  </s>
<s> i've had my d-link peripherals for 5+ years now.  </s>
<s> does anyone think that my equipment is at the end-of-life because it is so old?  </s>
<s> thank you all for your support and suggestions on this matter.  </s>
<s> for example and even cheaper units are out there with full retail n class units at 99 bucks or less so there is no money in repair and you won't pay any counter to test your unit since for less money you get a new wifi router.  </s>
<s> does that help?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yes, bob, this helps a great deal.  </s>
<s> i just got off the phone with d-link and since my router is discontinued and end-of-life there is no technical support available for my router since march 1, 2008.  </s>
<s> i would come out way cheaper just to purchase a brand new router and call it a day.  </s>
<s> it's not worth my stress level at his point.  </s>
<s> i did, however, get my money's worth since it was about 5 years old.  </s>
<s> tech support recommended that i upgrade to the wbr-1310 or the wbr-2310 router.  </s>
<s> i googled these units and both are considered pieces of crap and junk by a lot of the reviewers.  </s>
<s> i will have to steer clear of these units when shopping for my next d-link router.  </s>
<s> thanks for the advice and the link.  </s>
<s> the dir-655.  </s>
<s> one of the best and fastest out there.  </s>
<s> i've had great results from mine.  </s>
<s> thanks so much for this suggestion.  </s>
<s> i will take it into consideration.  </s>
<s> i've been reading reviews on a lot of d-link products, i.e. routers and it's a hit and miss type of situation with varying reviews.  </s>
<s> i just want my pci card and laptop adapter to be compatible with whatever d-link router i purchase.  </s>
<s> i don't have a lot of funds to purchase lots of unneccesary peripherals so i need to keep this very economical and basic.  </s>
<s> once again, thanks for your suggestion.  </s>
