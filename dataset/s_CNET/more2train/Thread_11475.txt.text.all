<s> i am interested in buying a wireless projector for home use.  </s>
<s> i plan to mount it to the ceiling.  </s>
<s> it will just be using it with my computer for general applications and display (not for gaming). the projection distance will be about 8 to 10 feet.  </s>
<s> ideally i would like to have 1024 x 768 resolution, but could live with less.  </s>
<s> most of the projectors that have come up in my search are over $1000.00.  </s>
<s> can anyone recommend a good projector or two, that is under $1000.00 (including the networking capability).  </s>
<s> also, do i need a special wireless router to use it?  </s>
<s> i just have a broadband wireless router (linksys wrt160n), will this work for this purpose?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> you didn't explain what wifi has to do with your usual projector.  </s>
<s> i would be guessing you thought you could use wifi to get an image from your pc (?) to the projector.  </s>
<s> i could be wrong.  </s>
<s> look at for another wireless solution.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> that seems like a pretty unique option.  </s>
<s> although it mentions that it is for use with a tv, i assume that plugging that into the usb port of a projector, that it should transmit the image through?  </s>
<s> i though most projectors though used either vga/dvi/hdmi for video signals... so would a usb link work?  </s>
<s> with regard to the wifi reference, most of the units i have seen refer to wifi as a connection.  </s>
<s> certainly if there are other (cheaper) options out there such as bluetooth or usb wireless, then i indeed would be interested in those options as well.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> as to your wifi reference can you supply an example?  </s>
<s> i can't find any.  </s>
<s> we know that bluetooth's data rate is so low, well, so low, who told you that was an option?  </s>
