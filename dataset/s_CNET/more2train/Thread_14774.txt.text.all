do you guys know of any hot swap capable external hard drives. 
i have multiple hard drives and it's troublesome to for me to turn on and off the computer just to exchange drives. 
i'm not sure how much you are planning to spend, but there are plenty of small external hard drive enclosures which offer hot-swap capability from companies like seagate, drobo, thecus, netgear, etc. the easiest thing will be to purchase two (or more) equal sized/type drives for the new enclosure and copy your existing data to them. 
good luck!

enables you to 'hot swap' hard-drives, runs on usb 2.0 or e-sata.
