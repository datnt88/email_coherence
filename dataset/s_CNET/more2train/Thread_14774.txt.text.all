<s> do you guys know of any hot swap capable external hard drives.  </s>
<s> i have multiple hard drives and it's troublesome to for me to turn on and off the computer just to exchange drives.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure how much you are planning to spend, but there are plenty of small external hard drive enclosures which offer hot-swap capability from companies like seagate, drobo, thecus, netgear, etc. the easiest thing will be to purchase two (or more) equal sized/type drives for the new enclosure and copy your existing data to them.  </s>
<s> good luck!  </s>
