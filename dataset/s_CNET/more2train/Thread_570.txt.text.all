<s> recently i have noticed that my mouse is jumpy.  </s>
<s> when i move to a location or move very slowly the mouse seems to jump a bit further or move up or down. the whole system is only about 6 months old.  </s>
<s> i have cleaned the mouse and tried to remove the mouse pad.  </s>
<s> i have tinkered with the settings in the properties without sucess.  </s>
<s> it is just a standard wheel mouse from ms. any ideas?????  </s>
<s> it could be a broken mouse or a very slow processor and if you perocessor is fast enough then there is a software or spyware running on your computer which is loading you cpu to it's maximum.  </s>
<s> there are more posibilities but these are the most common ones.  </s>
<s> shah,  </s>
<s> i don't have an answer for you but a few coments.  </s>
<s> we have just installed about 400 pc's with microsoft optical mice 1.0a.  </s>
<s> they all have similiar problems as you describe.  </s>
<s> occaisionally a small movement of the mouse causes a big move in the pointer on the screen.  </s>
<s> we have tried the differenet settings and mousepads too but the thing that solves the problem is switching to a logitech mouse - problem disapears  </s>
