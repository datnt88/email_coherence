my host machine is running xp home addition. 
i just got a cable modem installed so i then bought a wireless router and 2 wireless ethernet cards for 2 98se machines. 
all was good. 
all 3 machines are online. 
i ran the home network wizard on the xp machine and created the network disk for the 2 98se machines. 
after running the set-up disk on the 98se machines i am at the following point: the 2 98se machines can see each other and access the shared documents folder. the xp machine can see the 2 98se machines and access the shared documents folder. 
when either of the 98se machines tries to access the xp machine so they can print, i am prompted for a password to access the xp shared documents folder. 
what do i do? 
how am i to know what the password is. 
i was never prompted to create a password. 
thanks for any help 
protecting itself from uninvited intrusions. 
create a user on the xp machine for each of the 98s, add a password, then try to connect. 
if you don't have password set up in your xp pc, you don't need a password. 
but you do need to input the username. 
it should be &lt;domain namecomputer name&gt;, leave password blank.
