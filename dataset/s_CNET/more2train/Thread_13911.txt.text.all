i have a weird accurence with my ram i was alway under the impression ram could only be in set numbers like 256 512 1024 but some how i managed to wind up with 504 being displaying when i check properties of my computer. 
seen here... if someone could explain this to me i would be greatly appreciative ty. 
with the video adapter. the missing ram is used by the video card. 
shared video and audio. 
unless you use stand alone video and audio cards will read lower by the shared amount.
