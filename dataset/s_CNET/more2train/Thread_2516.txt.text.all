<s> such drives can fail with usb 1.1 ports or cables and... drive letters can vanish which has me checking tweakui to see if the letters were unchecked.  </s>
<s> since it's new, why not return it as defective?  </s>
<s> ...before you plugged the drive in?  </s>
<s> usually usb devices have a preferred order of installing, if software is necessary.  </s>
<s> did you try another usb cable or port?  </s>
<s> did you follow the installation instructions that came with the drive?  </s>
<s> if you list the drive model number it would be easier to help.  </s>
