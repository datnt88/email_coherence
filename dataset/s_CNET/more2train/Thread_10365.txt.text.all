i pulled the hdd from my mp3 player and connected it to my laptop via usb ide. the wizard connects and informs me that my new hardwear is ready. 
but i can not find the hdd in my computer. 
but i can find the hdd in the device manager. 
can anyone help me reformat it so i can use it as a external memory device. 
if you want to use that hdd as a hard drive you will have to go in to the computer management section of the administrative tools and format the disk so that windows knows about it and is formatted so windows can recognize it. 
or did you mean to use the hdd as some form of ram in the &quot;readyboost&quot; kind of way? 
regards, jb 
thanks alot jb. after a few clicks i was formating the drive.
