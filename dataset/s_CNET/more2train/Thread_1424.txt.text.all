<s> afternoon all, i've been trawling forums for a while now and not really found a solid answer.  </s>
<s> i think i dropped my wd passport, it was about a week ago and i was running around at work, and since then i can't get the drive to be recognised fully.  </s>
<s> setup acer 6950 laptop - vista hp sp1 symptoms under disk management, vista can find a drive it calls drive 1, unknown, at first when i tried to reinitialize it said cannot find the sector requested, now i just get improper function error not very scientific but i get the bing bong tones when it's plugged in and there is a drive to &quot;safely remove&quot;.  </s>
<s> it sometimes appears under disks in device manager and a usb mass storage device under usb i can also change the drive from performance to quick remove in the device properties solutions i've tried lying it on various sides, apparently that was a fix elsewhere different usb cables, though no new ones but the symptons are the same and i can't believe that 3 cables would all have the same problem any help or forum pointer would be amazing.  </s>
<s> i'm currently volunteering in tanzania with no local expertises, slow internet connection and limited funds, but i need to get some important research papers off the drive and am considering paying for data recovery.  </s>
<s> lesson learned not to leave important docs on drives.  </s>
<s> cheers in anticipation.  </s>
<s> trying all of the above on xp desktops  </s>
<s> beyond what's in this forum's top post about this you remove the drive from the case, place in a new case and hope.  </s>
<s> i won't duplicate the forum sticky contents here and for each new post.  </s>
<s> then off to bob  </s>
<s> remove the plastic casing.  </s>
<s> peel the foil back.  </s>
<s> slowly remove the &quot;usb card front section&quot; from the &quot;hard drive section&quot;.  </s>
<s> purchase a &quot;free agent goflex upgrade cable - usb 3.0...made by seagate&quot; (about $20 at bestbuy).  </s>
<s> plug it ino the hard drive section, plug the other end into you computer & it's fixed!  </s>
<s> you must clearly understand upon any drop damage, you have &quot;physical damage&quot; to contend with.  </s>
<s> its not just some s/w corruption or glitch, true physical h/w is more likely at fault here. the other posters offered fixes but it still depnds on the hd itself has any chance of recovery.  </s>
<s> i include damage to the ext.  </s>
<s> case, its ports and/or electronics.  </s>
<s> once you swap the hd itself to another ext.  </s>
<s> usb case, that's your last chance as a end-user fix.  </s>
<s> if it does work then, then contact the pros to do this.  </s>
<s> also, let's be clear as well, all attempts at getting any data recovery under physical damaged condition may further corrupt or cause data damage beyond what was initially incurred.  </s>
<s> so don't proceed until you have some ext.  </s>
<s> case or kit to try it on.  </s>
<s> don't be mislead into voodoo fixes as these can only further damage the ext.  </s>
<s> hd more, which is why i posted.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
