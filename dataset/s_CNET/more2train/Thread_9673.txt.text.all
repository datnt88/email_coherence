<s> i previously posted on my inability to boot to win 7 with nexxtech 03a10 7-port usb 2.0 hub connected.  </s>
<s> it appears there is a basic problem with the mob of this pavilion computer.  </s>
<s> i found some info indicating this device was only compatible with win xp; the vendor failed to tell me this, i had assumed he would.  </s>
<s> maybe he didn't know either.  </s>
<s> so i acknowledge i must purchase a new usb hub.  </s>
<s> but how do i ensure my next hub purchase is compatible with my hp pavilion desktop?  </s>
<s> there is no mention of os's on the websites, only pc and/or mac.  </s>
<s> i cannot afford to waste more money on dubious computer peripherals.  </s>
<s> any input as to what (brands) to look for would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> i've lost track of front usb ports that fail in too many ways.  </s>
<s> so try it one more time but on an rear usb 2.0 port.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> belkin 4-port usb ultra-mini travel hub will solve your problem and it is compatible with windows 7  </s>
<s> it's one of my really old desktops with the incorrect usb wiring and only a few things work on the front ports (mouse for example.) use the rear port and it's good.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have this nexxtech 7-port hub connected to a rear usb 2.0 port, to no avail. the fact that it will not boot to windows, but works when connected after boot up suggests that incompatability is the issue here.  </s>
<s> am searching for usb 2.0 hub by better manufacturer.  </s>
<s> thanx.  </s>
<s> today these are fungible and in over a decade no driver hunts here.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> what you say makes much sense.  </s>
<s> i may just have a nexxtech lemon here (not meant to disparage this company).  </s>
<s> the front usb's work for other peripherals e.g. b/u drive.  </s>
<s> i prefer an ac powered hub to cover any power hungry devices in the future.  </s>
<s> i am still perplexed that other than preventing booting to win 7, it works normally.  </s>
<s> as an aside, the green sound output jack on the rear panel has suddenly stopped functioning.  </s>
<s> in fact, have speakers connected to a front jack.  </s>
<s> another reason to get the old dell 5150 functioning as a backup computer.  </s>
<s> i am now starting a special savings account for the purchase of my next new desktop, as it seems this pavilion may be entering the croak phase.  </s>
<s> thanx again for your input.  </s>
<s> my last hp (literally!) would not boot to windows when many things were in the usb port.  </s>
<s> a bit of research tracked it down to a flaw in the bios hp sourced for this model.  </s>
<s> the name was &quot;insyde&quot; and hp made it clear they had no means to correct the flaw.  </s>
<s> keep in mind that it was not a flaw in the handful of smart phones, usb drives and hubs in this case.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanx for your input.  </s>
<s> refusal to correct a design error seems rampant in the home computer business.  </s>
<s> but people put up with it.  </s>
<s> i will consign this nexxtag hub to use with my win xp computer, if i can get to work in this brave new world.  </s>
<s> meanwhile i think a belkin product would likely be the best choice, although they never compatibility wiyh win 7 os.  </s>
<s> thank you all for your input.  </s>
<s> &quot;let the buyer beware&quot;  </s>
