i have an old dell and the sound card (creative) went to the rainbow bridge. 
i bought a xonar dg after reading a lot of reviews, installed it, hooked into my 4.1 system, and everything worked great and sound great. 
but i normally change back and forth between speakers and headphones for late night. 
the dell case has a proprietary front panel with a 10-pin straight line connector to a small board in the front panel. the xonar has a 9-pin headphone out, but now it's a bridge to nowhere. 
i tried one of the typical 9-pin connectors with the screws on the side but it didn't fit. 
is it possible to (if i can find the right connector) just run a line to the 9-pin out to the front of the case with a 3.5 stereo female for the headphones? 
unfortunately, to plug the headphones into the back of the card, it is necessary to unplug the speakers. 
nowhere on the xonar box is there a comment saying it's either/or, but such seems to be the situation. 
any suggestions short of putting my headphone away for good? 
i suggest this -&gt; getting front plugs to operate is troublesome on a good day.

appears to be just what the doctor ordered.
