<s> i have a couple of questions.  </s>
<s> we are getting high speed through our local isp that uses radio signals.  </s>
<s> one of their towers is close by. we have 4 pcs networked via eternet.  </s>
<s> we run win 98, winme and win xppro.  </s>
<s> our router is a tw100-s4w1ca by trend net.  </s>
<s> our isp will be delivering hardware and software tommorrow.  </s>
<s> an antenna that transmits and receives hooks to router on wan port with rg45 cable.  </s>
<s> my questions: 1) do we have to dedicate a given computer foir internet conection sharing, as we did when using dial up or will each go online thru router even if all others are turned off?  </s>
<s> 2) our son has a laptop with wi-fi.  </s>
<s> he can go on wireless at places such as our community college and starbucks.  </s>
<s> will he be abble to use our highspeed without being wired into our network?  </s>
<s> that is, if he loads software from our isp onto his will he be able to use our user name and password to connect or do we have to provide an ethernet cable?  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> we know that username and password are required at the very least.  </s>
<s> he gets signal for them now, but naturally cant login because of 128 bit security measures by isp. the stay encrypted to protect themselves and all others on network.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any helpo available.  </s>
<s> 1) as long as you have a router you don't need a dedicated computer for internet access.  </s>
<s> everyone goes through that router for access.  </s>
<s> 2)again if you have a router connect to the isp wireless equipment, your son's laptop can certainly connect to your network through a wifi access point which you will have to purchase from tigerdirect or futureshop.  </s>
<s> this access point will provide wireless coverage in your home so your son's laptop can connect to your home network.  </s>
<s> usually the wifi coverage is about 100 meters range so it should be enough for most home users.  </s>
<s> from the access point you need an ethernet cable to go to your router, but other than that your son's laptop is free to go anywhere in the house and do not need ur user name and password to go online since you have everything going through ur router.  </s>
<s> hope this is helpful.  </s>
<s> jim  </s>
<s> thanks so much.  </s>
<s> by the way, he had the option of having his computer set up by our isp to receive wireless anywhere in our town that has signal available.  </s>
<s> it only cost 5 bucks a month extra, so now he can hit them from work or at any of his friends houses.  </s>
<s> setting it up was free!  </s>
