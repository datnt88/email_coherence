i would like know if there are any netbooks that comes with windows 7 home premium instead of windows starter??? 
see below win7 netbooks there may be others. 
i'd think any that support starter or basic will also support home premium or pro but you'd have to buy the upgrade yourself. 
thanks for that link...checking it out right now.
