<s> i would like know if there are any netbooks that comes with windows 7 home premium instead of windows starter???  </s>
<s> see below win7 netbooks there may be others.  </s>
<s> i'd think any that support starter or basic will also support home premium or pro but you'd have to buy the upgrade yourself.  </s>
<s> thanks for that link...checking it out right now.  </s>
