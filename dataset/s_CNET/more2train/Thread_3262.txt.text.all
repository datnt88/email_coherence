i installed a new wireless router and i want to use the old router as a network extender. 
can i use the old one as an extender without running an ethernet cable to it? 
but post 17 of shares how to use it as a wap. 
even if it's all of 2 feet from the current router you can set it on another channel and get more coverage. 
nope, you need a range extender or wireless access point.
