<s> if you followed the news, you knew the wep, mac address filters were ineffective and that hiding the network name or ssid only caused pain to you and your network.  </s>
<s> now with this news the question changes to if you really need to change from wpa.  </s>
<s> my thought is the answer is &quot;depends.&quot; read the articles carefully and you discover that they can only crack wpa if the password is in the dictionary.  </s>
<s> your better passwords with leading and trailing numbers appear to fail to be cracked.  </s>

<s> this forum's sticky and advice here still looks good.  </s>
<s> remember that some can't make the leap to wpa2 yet.  </s>
<s> if your wifi is on wpa2 today and all is well you can take a nap for another year and check monthly for any news.  </s>

<s> i have a new compaq cq61-313us notebook with windows 7 and a 2005 netgear router that works fine.  </s>
<s> i have the router set for wpa-psk and a long passphrase with a combination of 10 letters and numbers.  </s>
<s> i have my computer wireless network properties set for wpa-personal and encryption type tkip.  </s>
<s> when i changed the encryption to aes i lost my wireless connection so i changed it back to tkip and got my connection back.  </s>
<s> should i change the wpa-personal to wpa 2-personal?  </s>
<s> if so should i change the tkip to aes or leave it on tkip?  </s>
<s> would my router support this change?  </s>
<s> read the article again and decide.  </s>
<s> i can't tell if your hardware supports it but it seems easy enough to try it and change back.  </s>
