<s> hi, for some weeks now, im searching for a solution to stream live video from a wearable device (glasses, headset) to a windows system for recording.  </s>
<s> requirement is complete freedom from &lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;any lan.  </s>
<s> most promising possibility yet seems to be the looxcie camera . the android market app promisis an integration into browsers to come soon: ( ) currently it seems to be streaming from mobile to mobile only, though.  </s>
<s> whats interesting is that even the cia starts to get interested in the device, as the spend a lot of money on it recently ( ). thanks for replies .  </s>
<s> you've found a few but the problem remains about the buyer's expectations.  </s>
<s> for example a few that don't know about data transfer limits want 1080p video but then are upset about the costs.  </s>
<s> it's currently about 1 million and a custom job.  </s>
<s> consumer grade stuff?  </s>
<s> you've seen it.  </s>
<s> so my question to you is why didn't you buy it?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yes, it seems definetely the best solution for an limited budget.  </s>
<s> but i have seen too many companys promise future features to just believe in a statement on android market.  </s>
<s> its definitely most important to be able to watch and record the stream on a pc.  </s>
<s> wait till they deliver or use the apple iphone in the meantime.  </s>
<s> i'm sure there are other solutions out there.  </s>
<s> but i won't give a nod to any because i've found such to be too finicky for most.  </s>
<s> that is, what happens when the device can't connect.  </s>
<s> most folk have high expectations and low budgets.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the multi-million buck solution i've seen used more than one 3g link (aggregation) to get enough throughput.  </s>
<s> your average joe will not be doing that and will often whine when they try the usual off the shelf stuff.  </s>
<s> -&gt; if you are smart you do the research and then move back to what works.  </s>
<s> record what you want then upload it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> youre right with your estimate.  </s>
<s> somehow it was my fault not be clear about my goals: im no movie-maker or anything who wants hd / premium quality material to be recorded.  </s>
<s> all this is just part of an experiment (university), where the viewer at the at home will be pleased when the area and persons around camera are recognizable.  </s>
<s> would you still say, in this case, that the pure data amount would be so much to just throw away the idea?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> but my background involves dvr for security systems.  </s>
<s> we push video over wireless and have programmers and more to get it working.  </s>
<s> i can't know if you are simply a consumer or someone that dives in and writes code and builds hardware.  </s>
<s> that's why i can't give you any good news. it seems you want to buy something and play with it rather than build it, program it and such.  </s>
<s> sorry if this offends you in any way.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
