<s> the laptop connects to the router but is showing limited access.  </s>
<s> anyone know how to fix this?  </s>
<s> i am not advanced in this type of problem so if anyone can help me out thanks!  </s>
<s> i assume you are using wireless -- if so it's probably a reception problem.  </s>
<s> try changing channels -- especially if you can detect neighbouring wifi (then choose a channel 5 stops away from strongest).  </s>
<s> try raising the router above furniture level and try swivelling the antenna.  </s>
<s> you have considered whether the router has wireless security enabled and tried applying the correct security type and passphrase to your computer's wireless user interface ?  </s>
