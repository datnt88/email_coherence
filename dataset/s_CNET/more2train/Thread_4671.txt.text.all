<s> i have a dell desktop 8100 with win 2000.  </s>
<s> for last few months it has started to make rattling noise when i start the computer; the noise dies out in 5-6 minutes after being started.  </s>
<s> i was told to clean the fan, which i had with reduction in the noise.  </s>
<s> i was told it could be dying hard drive too.  </s>
<s> but if it was a hard drive problem then why the noise is better after i cleaned the fan?? my questions are: 1) is there a good free software to check out my hard drive.  </s>
<s> i do have a norton system 2001.  </s>
<s> 2) should i replace the fans?  </s>
<s> which ones first?  </s>
<s> where can i buy in stores?  </s>
<s> 3)if hard drive needs to changed, should i get form dell or can i use other brands?? thnx a lot supermoe  </s>
<s> you can download drive diagnostic programs from there.  </s>
<s> put them on a floppy and thjey will check the drive.  </s>
<s> if you improved the noise by cleaning the fan before, the fan may be [likely is] a crappy sleeve bearinf type and the bearing is worn and the fan wobbles.  </s>
<s> replace it with a ball bearing/dual ball bearing type.  </s>
<s> fans, even after cleaning can have stop/go intermit operation, replace it to be 100% sure.  </s>
<s> also, thr power supply fan can be the same way, so verify its working plus *all* fans.  </s>
<s> as for hds, you can add any hd vendors model.  </s>
<s> dell, has a help guide to &quot;upgrade&quot; adding a 2nd hd, but use that as if installing a new replacement hd. if the hd happens to be under warranty use that.  </s>
<s> you can leave the side cover off to help pin-point the noise source.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
