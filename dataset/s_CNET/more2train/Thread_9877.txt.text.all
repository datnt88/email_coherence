i have a msi p965 neo-f motherboard, c2d e6300 processor (1,81 ghz rated at 4,1 ghz.. what does that mean?) and 1gb ram. 
i've found the ram i'm going to buy. 
what is the best graphics card my mobo is compitable with? 
except for those 200+ ones x) but still a very good one? 
your mobo can accept any pci-express x16 video card. the hd 4870 is the overall fastest video card for less than $200. 
asus hd 4870 512mb, $165 before $30 rebate his hd 4870 512mb, $165 before $10 rebate, includes stalker clear sky game his hd 4870 1gb, $190 before $20 rebate if you prefer nvidia, a geforce gtx 260 is comparable. 
sparkle geforce gtx 260+ 896mb, $180 evga geforce gtx 260 896mb, $185 before $20 rebate, includes call of duty game a radeon hd 4850 is a good choice also and even less expensive. 
powercolor hd 4850 512mb, $130 before $10 rebate his hd 4850 512mb, $130, includes stalker clear sky game
