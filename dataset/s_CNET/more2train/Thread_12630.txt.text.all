comparing a @gb intel duo processor t2500 running at 533mhz vs. one running at 667mhz--is there any discernable or significant advantage to the much-more-expensive 667 chip? 
it's over at if you don't want to perform your own benchmark.

by means of some maintenance program i found out that my machine runs on an amd athlon(tm) xp 1250 mhz max: 3000 mhz. 
chipset: via 83c3189 rev 128. 
as i understand then my computer is not even running on half the speed the processor can handle. 
there must be a catch. is there anybody out there to fill me in? 
i would very much appreciate. 
cleirens@freegates.be, 
thank you.
