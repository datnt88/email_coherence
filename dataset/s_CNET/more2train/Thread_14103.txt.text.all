i have a compaq nc6000 laptop running xp2. 
devices (all of which don't work right with it regularly) - adesso keyboard/touchpad mouse combo, wkb 4000us. 
- kensington wireless mouse (pilot mouse laser wireless pro, model m01006) (might conflict with adesso since that has touchpad mouse, but even if i skip the kensington or disable its mousepad in device manager, still adesso has issues) - palm z22, synced via mini-usb cable - skype converter to allow conversation on regular phone (yealink b2k skype rj11-usb phone adapter) when i hook devices to the pc - even if just keyboard - devices aren't detected, don't install right, or if device does chance to work (after plug/unplug from different usb ports for 45 minutes at random), then the pc's sound goes out, so no music. 
all devices work sometimes if i plug/unplug enough, but many seem to kill the pc's sound, and i can never get all devices to stay working. 
i assume it's due to irq conflicts or some such, but all i know of irq is the name, basic concept, not how to see or control which irq the sound card or a usb device uses. 
how to troubleshoot? 
many thanks! 
reinstall or os(operating system) as you didn't say what os you where using on your pc and that could be a factor 
but it could be an os problem anyway
