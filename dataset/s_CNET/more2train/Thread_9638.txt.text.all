<s> hey, i am planning to buy a motherboard and a new processor.  </s>
<s> i have chosen these two products below, however i don't know if they are compatible with each other, can somebody please help me?  </s>
<s> thank you motherboard: processor:  </s>
<s> but zzf has the e6600 for a few dollars less. since you're getting the mobo from zzf, why not get the cpu from them also?  </s>
<s> also, did you choose the e6600 because you intend to overclock?  </s>
<s> if not, the e6750 is faster (2.67ghz vs 2.4ghz) and cheaper ($205 vs $228):  </s>
<s> no i did not chose it because i was planning to over clock it, in fact i wouldn't even do that.  </s>
<s> thank you for the provided choices i will now purchase the 2nd model that you suggested.  </s>
