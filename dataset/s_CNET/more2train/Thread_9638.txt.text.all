hey, i am planning to buy a motherboard and a new processor. 
i have chosen these two products below, however i don't know if they are compatible with each other, can somebody please help me? 
thank you motherboard: processor: 
but zzf has the e6600 for a few dollars less. since you're getting the mobo from zzf, why not get the cpu from them also? 
also, did you choose the e6600 because you intend to overclock? 
if not, the e6750 is faster (2.67ghz vs 2.4ghz) and cheaper ($205 vs $228): 
no i did not chose it because i was planning to over clock it, in fact i wouldn't even do that. 
thank you for the provided choices i will now purchase the 2nd model that you suggested.
