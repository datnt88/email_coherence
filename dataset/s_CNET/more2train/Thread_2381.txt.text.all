hi, i would appreciate your help / advice / suggestions, with a networking problem. 
i have a smc2804wbr 2.4ghz 54mbps wireless cable/dsl broadband router that apparently is not powerful enough to broadcast the wireless signals through the walls in my house and would appreciate any advice / recommendatiosn / suggestions / ...., that will allow me to wirelessily connect 2 windowsxp pcs that are about 150 feet from each other but with several rooms and maybe 10 walls, between computer &quot;a&quot; and computer &quot;b&quot;? 
thanks, bob 
even moreso with walls. 
try using some ac powerline pairs such as now put a wifi router at the other end and viola.

you might also look into getting a wireless range extender that you would place somewhere in between the place where you have your router and your pcs. 
all that would be required is a power outlet once the initial configuration is setup in the range extender.
