<s> hp pavillion 540n power supply fan is (intermittent) noisy (high pitch resonance) what can we do about it ?  </s>
<s> leo  </s>
<s> buy a replacement power supply, that's really the only option normally available in these cases.  </s>
<s> if its just dirty clean fan, ive done that find a mom pop shop get a bad power supply replace fan  </s>
<s> replace the fan, of course.  </s>
<s> however, replacing the fan maybe 1/2 of the problem as prolonged operation of an intermit fan causes &quot;stress&quot; on the p/s componets and there's a 50/50 chance it will fail entirely.  </s>
<s> while, the replacing the fan makes sense, replacing the p/s is a more practical solution besides a new p/s plus the included fan, you have a chance to increase the wattage of p/s if available. the choice is yours. the fan size is usually 80 or 90mm in size or 3-4in.. good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> i have a hp pavillion 8700 also with a noisy fan.  </s>
<s> you talked of a powersupply fan. is there more than one fan inside?  </s>
<s> it sounds like your power supply fan is just beginning to go.  </s>
<s> if you replace it now now chances are your power supply is fine because the rpms on the fan haven't dropped too much.  </s>
<s> there is only one fan, but trying to find a replacement and putting one in can be more trouble than just replacing the powersupply.  </s>
