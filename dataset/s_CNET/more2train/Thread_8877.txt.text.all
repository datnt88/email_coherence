<s> i have a home wireless network with a linksys router and network card that runs on the 11b technology.  </s>
<s> i'm having no problems getting connection on a computer two floors below.  </s>
<s> my girlfriend's father wanted me to set up a wirless network in his house.  </s>
<s> he bought a motorola router and card that has the 11g technology. the computer he is trying to connect with is only 1 floor below but it's barely getting a signal and has trouble connecting to the internet.  </s>
<s> the router and computer are on opposite ends of the house but i would still expect to get a better signal than what it's been getting.  </s>
<s> they are probably only about 40-50ft away from each other.  </s>
<s> isn't the g technology supposed to give a better range than b? i don't understand why it's having such a hard time connecting.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> you may want to try moving the wireless device closer to the router and note what effect that has.  </s>
<s> some homes have construction materials which can effect wireless transmissions in addition to other wireless devices working in the same frequency range.  </s>
<s> be sure that all firmware and drivers are uptodate.  </s>
<s> just last week was another reminder that new out of the box components are being sent to us with almost non-functional firmware or drivers.  </s>
<s> you get to update such.  </s>
