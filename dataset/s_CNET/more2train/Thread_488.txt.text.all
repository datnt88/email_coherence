<s> i bought a brand new seagate freeagent 500gb usb desktop external hard drive from compusa (on sale for $120 + tax).  </s>
<s> i plan to use it on an older laptop running xp and hopefully a new pc (haven't bought yet) running vista.  </s>
<s> my question is: how can i get a bunch of data off an old pc running windows me ? the machine recognizes the device as a usb disk; but it is not available to browse in my computer.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance, s  </s>
<s> the really new versions require zero linux skill and write to most usb drives.  </s>

<s> i think you are suggesting i use linux to move my files; but... any other ideas?  </s>
<s> ...the 9x/me drivers for the external drive in place ?  </s>
<s> then- apart from linux or dos, or an os on a cd, there is &quot; slave &quot;.  </s>
<s> you boot a cd, some windows show up with drive letters and files and you copy them as you learned in windows.  </s>
<s> now, what linux skill did that involve?  </s>
