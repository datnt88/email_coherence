im trying to transfer files between my pc on xp and laptop on 98. ive tried connecting nic to nic using a crossover cable and i get the connected led lighting up. 
but what do i have to do after that, do i have to set something up in 'my network places' ? 
also im getting a new desktop with xp so will the same method work for xp to xp? pre thanks 
go start&gt;accessories&gt; system tools&gt;file and settings transfer. 
you can go to the help section or online to research various knowledge articles. 
you can also transfer by other methods cd/dvd's or software programs. 
read on what xp offers.
