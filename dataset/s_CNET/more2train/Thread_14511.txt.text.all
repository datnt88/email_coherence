<s> i have an oldie-goldie pc on my network that is pre-ps2, uses a giant round amphenol multi-pin connector for the keyboard.  </s>
<s> i threw out the old kb when i went to usb, now, after a power failure, i find the cmos battery is low and the checksum is bad, the bios asks me to &quot;press f2 to load defaults&quot; and of course it does not detect the usb kb.  </s>
<s> replacing the battery won't help.  </s>
<s> any workaround?  </s>
<s> you don't!!! can you borrow a keyboad from some one??? does your usb keyboard have an adapter to convert it to ps/2 mini din?  </s>

<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have a couple adapters, neither works, i remember having issues with this in the past, i.e., if the adapter doesn't come with the keyboard (or mouse for serial mice), it doesn't seem to work.  </s>
<s> worry not...it was time to decommission the old girl anyway, i have a spare pc. always fun building a new spare, thanks all.  </s>
