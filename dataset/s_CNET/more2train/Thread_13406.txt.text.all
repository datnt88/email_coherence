<s> i've been asking around, a lot.....here and elsewhere.  </s>
<s> many different ppl have said many different things about upgrades of cards.  </s>
<s> i just want the simplest way to upgrade to a dedicated card that can play some games.  </s>
<s> but not the high-end intense games like &quot;oblivion&quot;. and can give me good video when watching in hd. i would like to avoid upgrading the power supply (if possible).  </s>
<s> i'm new to upgrading on my own, so i'd like to go simple.  </s>
<s> these are my specs: hp pavilion a6157c desktop 250w power supply 2gb memory 320gb hard drive e4400, 2.0ghz intel processor windows vista home premium integrated media accelerator 950 &quot;card&quot; (chip onboard) i got my bundle very reasonably priced w/ an hp w2207 wide 22&quot; brightview monitor w/dvi and cables ($999 costco) i've been told by techs at best buy i can go with the nvidia geforce 8500gt pci-express w/512 mb using my 250w supply, but hp say i'd need to upgrade power to 300w.  </s>
<s> hp also says i can go with nvidia 7600gs, but would still need to upgrade to 300w.  </s>
<s> infact hp said any newer card today would need to be used w/ 300w.  </s>
<s> who's right here???? maybe if i find i'm capable at installing this graphics card, i may venture out in the future and build my own, or keep expanding (as much as possible), on this bundle.  </s>
<s> i'd pick the lowest cost offering from this link -&gt; bob  </s>
<s> go to google and type in &quot;power supply calculator&quot; the first link click it and fill in all that you have.  </s>
<s> this will give you an idea of how much juice you are using.  </s>
<s> so when deciding what card to get you dont affect system performance.  </s>
<s> but consider: best buy's goal is to sell you stuff, i personally would never trust anything they tell you ever, especially after reading about the geek squad &quot;scandal&quot; (more like acknowledgement of what we all knew was happening anyways).  </s>
<s> they'll tell you it'll work, sell you the hardware, and if the system comes back damaged, why does it hurt them?  </s>
<s> they get more reputation for helping you fix it, and more money from you buying parts.  </s>
<s> hp is the original manufacturer, and therefore should be considered the authority on the system, even if the csr isn't an electrical engineer, they've likely dealt with your particular model a thousand times over, and have the hp spec sheets telling them what it can and can't do, regardless of what some (can i say punk?) employee at best buy tells you.  </s>
<s> an online psu calculator can be very helpful, but consider that it only gives you an estimate of wattage draw, and doesn't take into account power supply efficiency.  </s>
<s> most modern high end psus are 450-550w, purely because thats where most enthusiast buyers are shopping (because they want to power high end parts like geforce 8800's and quad core processors).  </s>
<s> i would say either the 8500, or hp's suggestion of the 7600gs (newegg has a nice deal on a his radeon x1650pro which is $62 ar)) but to the power supply point, most 250-350w units are low quality, however there are a few decent quality units such as the antec smartpower 350w.  </s>
