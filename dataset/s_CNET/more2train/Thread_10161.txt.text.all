i have a computer with xp office o.s. that can not be authenicated. 
i have an original disc of xp home registered in my name, can i install the home edition over the office xp without problems? 
but the short version is this article -&gt; there is a microsoft article but this one is simpler to follow. 
you don't need to reinstall the os. bob 
thanks for your answer, have one question. 
on the info to reset in #3 it says type in new product key (corporate one only). 
i have a home edition product key, will this work? 
notes the same steps, but clarifies why they noted the corporate key. 
you only have to enter your new key... bob
