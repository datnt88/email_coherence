<s> does anyone know where i can learn what the ideal cpu temperature is?  </s>
<s> i've heard 45 deg c when not being used and 65 deg c when heavily active.  </s>
<s> i've been annoyed with my fan running at 80% all the time to ensure that my cpu stays cool.  </s>
<s> so i just lowered it to around 65% and now my temperature hovers around 65% when i'm gaming.  </s>
<s> i want to make sure i'm not going to blow the darn thing up.  </s>
<s> thanks ahead of time.  </s>
<s> heatsink fan you're running...kinda difficult to provide any further response.  </s>
<s> download and run cpuz...then repost specifics.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> i still have a prescott p4 3.6ghz and it idles at 52-57 c, but than the local temp is in the high 80s f. my p4 has gone up to over 100 degrees celcius, w/ no fan because for some reason, the automatic shutdown failed on me , and nothing happened to the processor...i'm using that computer right now to type out this response.  </s>
<s> highly not recommended to try at home.  </s>
<s> cpuz is a great program by the way.  </s>
<s> processor(s) number of processors  </s>
<s> maybe you need a better, higher performance cpu heatsink fan ...one that's quieter.  </s>

<s> nmedia 200a case.  </s>
<s> install went pretty well, i even got the viiv software installed and working correctly.  </s>
<s> my issue is the cpu temp. the nmedia case has two temperature sensors that display cpu and case temp on the vfd.the cpu temp starts around 75 f and within 30 minutes heads up to about 93f. it will then stay at 93 f for as long as i have it on.  </s>

<s> thanks again  </s>
<s> i have an athlon 64 3200+ venice on socket 754 (its ancient but it works for me along with vista) connected to a thermaltake golden orb ii with no fan control but running at 2200rpm tops and arctic silver 5 grease.  </s>
<s> it is very good if it runs 20^c but anything under probably may be sensors incorrection up to what you said.  </s>
<s> anything higher, you should probably turn off the machine and check if the heatsink is properly attached or if the thermal grease needs to be wiped and freshly applied.  </s>
<s> if there is no grease but a tape, buy a small pack of arctic silver 5 which is usually around 5 bucks and apply a bead size or a specific amount that intel/amd recommends.  </s>
<s> whoever told you 45^c needs to do some more research...  </s>
<s> if those temperatures are in fahrenheit, then it should usually be around 35^c for 75^f and 40 to 50ish for the 90s.  </s>
<s> i'm just guessing these conversions but i assure you if those are fahrenheit and not celcius then it is fine  </s>
