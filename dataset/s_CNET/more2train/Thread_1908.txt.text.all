<s> i want to buy a new lcd, but i do not know which ones to buy.  </s>
<s> i would like to know if contrast ratios and response times are important.  </s>
<s> and if they are, what should their values be?  </s>
<s> i am looking to buy a benq fp937s 19&quot; lcd, 12ms response time, 500:1 contrast ratio, 250 nits brightness. is that a good choice?  </s>
<s> i will be using the monitor for basic computer use, (web surfing, watching dvd's, word processing, etc.) and some light gaming, (half life, counterstrike, etc.)  </s>
<s> i have both dvi and vga supported on my computer, but i don't know which one to use.  </s>
<s> i've heard mixed opinions about which is better.  </s>
<s> anybody know which one would be better?  </s>
<s> my answer is this. 1. look at the display and see if you like it.  </s>
<s> &quot;specs&quot; can be meaningless.  </s>
<s> 2. i've seen both vga and dvi hookups and ... &quot;i can't see the difference&quot;.  </s>

<s> the lcd's at the store all look similar to me... they don't seem that great because they're all hooked up to one source and it comes out bad.  </s>
<s> so i'm kinda left with the specs...  </s>
<s> if they look bad there, why buy?  </s>

<s> gaming.  </s>
<s> [is half-life considered &quot;light&quot; gaming???] but the writeups that i have seen on many of the fast response ones suffered in color and text quality compared to their old 25 ms brothers.  </s>
<s> maximum pc magazine about 3 issues ago finally found a few that they considered acceptable for gaming.  </s>
<s> but they didn't rave about any of them.  </s>
<s> imho ,make certain that the one you get is the second generation version of the fast speed ones from the mfr's that you choose.  </s>
<s> seems that in the rush to get fast speed they may not have checked the other parameters that well in their first releases.  </s>
<s> has anybody seen this monitor before?  </s>
<s> there aren't much good reviews out there, so i'm looking to forums now for information.  </s>
