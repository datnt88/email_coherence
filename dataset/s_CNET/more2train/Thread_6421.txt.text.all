firstly is there much difference in getting an athlon 64 x2 5000+ (2.60ghz, 512kx2) over the 4400+ chip? 
also, is the 256mb nvidia geforce 8600gt- ddr3 much better than the 128mb nvidia geforce 8300gs? 
the 5000+ runs at 2.6ghz vs. the 4400+ at 2.3ghz. 
that's a noticeable (but not huge) difference. the 8600gt will be much faster than a 8300gs. 
you'll actually be able to play some modern games with the 8600gt but the 8300gs will be dog slow. 
there isn't a massive gap, the x2 5000 will bench faster, and you might notice it by a hair (if you owned both and could compare them side by side) in a few games (fear, supreme commander, hitman 4, ones that load onto the cpu with some force) however between the two, if you just owned one, you wouldn't likely notice it, if theres more than ~$30 between them, i'd go for the 4400 unless you can afford either the 8600gt is going to be faster than the 8300gs by something like 2 or 3x, its a much more capable board, if gaming is your goal, i'd go with the 8600 (other boards to consider: geforce 8600gts, radeon hd 2600pro, radeon hd 2600xt, radeon x1950gt, radeon x1950pro) 
i will buy the amd 5000+ then as the price is not much different and within my budget and i have taken your advice and bought the better video card. 
thanks for the advice!
