<s> my vga is a nvidia geforce 9600gt.  </s>
<s> my cpu is an intel core2 quad cpu q8200 @ 2.33ghz.  </s>
<s> my sound system goes haywire sometimes and it doesnt work right now.  </s>

<s> i have formatted my drives once already and i also have changed operating systems from xp to windows 7 thinking that might of helped.  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> do you think there is hardware incompatibillity?  </s>
<s> please help me out, email me @ tommy_nurmi@hotmail.com  </s>
<s> my power supply is a extreme power duo with 650w's  </s>
<s> there are also other blue screen errors like irql_is_not_less_or_equal any ideas?  </s>
<s> voltages to see if they're in spec ?  </s>
<s> what ram are you using ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> i am using ddr2 4gb vitesta 2 chip which is compatible with the motherboard.  </s>
<s> i found reviews about my motherboard that i am using and found out there is something with the ga-ep45-ud3r that makes the ram unstable.  </s>
<s> i used a voltage calculator on &quot; and put in everything i am using and found out i only need to use a 333w psu but i have 650ws.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i used memtest86+ and there were no errors found.  </s>
<s> i recently found out that i am running a ddr2 1066 533 mhz but my motherboard only runs ddr2 1366+ so the ram that i am using is incompatible with the motherboard.  </s>
<s> could this be the reason that my computer is doing all this? should i swap my ram for another one immediantly?  </s>
<s> by the way ddr2 1066 is one of several ram speeds compatible with that mb...&quot;support for ddr2 1366+*/1066/800/667 mhz memory modules&quot;.  </s>
<s> check you mb docs if you have any questions when i said voltages i meant was were the voltages in spec...was the 12v line reading 12v or 11.3v ?  </s>
<s> by the way .... how many hdds are you running ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> i checked the +12v line reading and it said 12.175v, is this a problem?  </s>
<s> i am running 4 hdd's and i asked the computer technicians to make it into 2 or 3 i think this is possible am i correct or do i have to reinstall the os again?  </s>
<s> when i was going through the bios settings i found out the drams performance was set on turbo so it was being overclocked for all this time, i switched it back to standard so i think there is more stabillity now then before.  </s>
<s> could this be the problem?  </s>
<s> re the 12v ....12.17v reading is fine.  </s>

<s> if it's running more reliably with ram turbo off ... leave it off.  </s>
