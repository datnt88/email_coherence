<s> i have a vcr/dvd with a hard drive built in.  </s>
<s> i would like to clone the original to a larger hard drive and don't think this can be done from a computer.  </s>
<s> is there cloning devices that will work outside the computer such as a power source with the cables for transfering info?  </s>
<s> thanks, steve  </s>
<s> most systems like that use a hard disk &quot;saint&quot; procedure that is specific to the make/model of the hd based recorder.  </s>
<s> since you didn't name the make/model you disabled us from looking to see if such a procedure was known.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the machine i have (vhs/dvd/hard drive)is a jvc dr-mx1, i have not opened it yet to find out what kind of hard drive it has.  </s>
<s> if need be, i will open the case.  </s>
<s> just let me know.  </s>
<s> you'll have to decide if you want to take a chance.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> until i open the case, is there any inexpensive ways to clone a hard drive outside the computer?? steve  </s>
<s> but remember that my definition of inexpensive is a pc and google.com  </s>
<s> information.  </s>
<s> expensive is paying someone to do all that.  </s>
