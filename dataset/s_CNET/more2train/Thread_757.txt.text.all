<s> if you already have speakers and a keyboard, you can decrease the price to $1500.  </s>
<s> also a modem is not necessary so like $1480.  </s>

<s> cnet has an online course for &quot;build your own pc,&quot; the link is on the left under online courses.  </s>
<s> i don't know what your budget is and what type of system you want but you can get all your components at newegg.com.  </s>
<s> to the pc hardware section of this site and look at the thread abotu building best machine...then look at the one ozos made...thats about as good as it gets  </s>
<s> also, for building a dream machine, there is one question: what you gonna use it for?  </s>
<s> if we know that, we can suggest hardware  </s>
<s> some info and check the gaming builders shown here to get a feel on what components would fill your dream machine then go from there: a computer costing $10,000 is not practical unless you are making 6 figure $'s and want to impress your friends.  </s>
<s> there is currently sli dual graphic card systems out now that can eat up some $$. alienware, dell, and velocity micro started on april 18 selling desktop pcs and workstations based on intel's first dual-core processor-based platform.  </s>
<s> the intel pentium processor extreme edition 840 is priced around t $999 and the intel 955x express chipset is priced around $50.  </s>
<s> but he said dream machine, so i brought it up  </s>
<s> i know my dad pulls in 6 figures but their is no way in hell he will buy me a comp like that...i would be happy if he put $500 towards a new one for me  </s>
<s> has some barebone systems that might help you.  </s>
<s> it lists products from newegg and others.  </s>
<s> you can build according to their specs.  </s>
<s> if you know how to build computers you need to check the prices sometimes its cheaper buy a brand name , the best is dell for just cases and mb that it uses also some of the deals they have especially this month they are giving alot away like free printer and 17&quot; or 19&quot; lcd, the other companies are a pain to add hardware like harddrives, because you don't know whose motherboard is used plus the cases are small and pain to take apart.  </s>
<s> you need to get the parts cheap to match brand name since you get os for nothing.  </s>
<s> i just brought from dell different computers, i couldn't build them for the price i got them.  </s>
<s> i got was dimension 8400 has intel motherboard with intel 915g chipset which has matrix raid onboard.  </s>
<s> i brought homexp,intel made 775socket with matrix raid, intel540 cpu,512meg ram,80gb sata drive,48x cdrom, ati x300 128meg pcie video card nic and ultrasharp 17&quot; lcd with 16ms refresh and dell 720 printer for $599.  </s>
<s> i plan to sell x300 and 80gb sata drive and replace with either nvidia 6800gt or ati x800/850 video card and turn on the raid and put in 2 @250gb sata drives, soundblaster audigy2 platinum,2@ dvd dual layer burners all for less than $1000. the other was windows media center 2005, intel 560 cpu, 512meg ram, 160gb sata drive,soundblaster audigy2, 256meg nvidia 6800gt,16x dvdrom, 16x dvd dual layer burner,56k modem, nicand 3 year warranty for $725, i just missed a xps generation 4 with intel560 2gb ram,audigy2,256meg nvidia 6800gt pcie video, 16xdvd dual layer burner,2@250gb sata drives for $1220.  </s>
<s> parts along cost $1500 without os.  </s>
<s> dell's mb's are of the lowest quality their cases are equal and their psu's, while decent, don't allow much upgradeability you can put any hard drive in any machine it's just an ide device as far as grpahics it's the same way dell is a horrible company as they give you zero upgradeability (few have agp slots, bad bios, bad ram, bad cooling)  </s>
<s> that is your opinion ozos, perhaps from some you have come across in the past, but not the later dell's imo, especially in the 8400 series and xps.  </s>
<s> even the 4700 series (along with the 8400/xps now all have the pci-express x-16 capabilities instead of no upgrade. the cooling is ok on the 8400 with their bigger case and the ram is now adequate imo.  </s>
<s> dell will also be coming out with the new intel dual processors as recently reported.  </s>
<s> i'm talking about low end dell's the xps gen 4 is what?  </s>
<s> $3000?  </s>
<s> $2000?  </s>
<s> something like that the 8400 is amazingly expensive (i know this, a friend got one, their expensive beyond belief, and for what you get...yuck) it wasl ike $2200, and features a slower gpu, and comparable cpu to my system which is only around $1200 i mean seriously...dell's low end are just junk, no upgrades and bad bios and their high end are over priced  </s>
<s> don't know what your friend is telling you but the 8400 is not &quot;amazingly expensive&quot;.  </s>
<s> a 8400 from dell starts out at $879 with free shipping.  </s>
<s> this 8400 can be configured for $1238 with free shipping: pent4 processor 640 (em64t)3.2ghz,  </s>

<s> with 3.6 ghz $1648 the xps gen4 gamer starts out at $1599 with about the same features as the 8400 3.2ghz, however imo the 8400 is the better buy for the money.  </s>
