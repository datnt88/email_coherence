<s> i have a lot of old vinyl and cassettes that i want to transfer to digital format on my computer.  </s>
<s> since the source of these formats are analog, and the typical line-in on a sound card is analog, i am wondering how i can best tranfer the audio data to digital.  </s>
<s> my stereo receiver does not have a digital output, only inputs.  </s>
<s> i guess what i am asking is for the &quot;best&quot; means to convert old format audio to digital and what hardware/software should i be looking at?  </s>
<s> particularly the sound card and the proper input to the pc for capturing the digital conversion.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> there is no quick and easy transfer.  </s>
<s> it take 60 minutes to capture 60 minutes of lp or tape music.  </s>
<s> you connect the source, via cable, to the &quot;line in&quot; connector on the sound card.  </s>
<s> cable available at radio shack.  </s>
<s> you play the lp or tape and use recording sofware on the computer to capture the music.  </s>
<s> here are two sets of instructions i found on the cnet site: ... .. .  </s>
<s> in addition to that simple wiring set up there is some very good software by steinberg called &quot;clean up&quot; i think which is specifically designed to digitally remove the hiss and crackle associated with vinyl and tape.  </s>
<s> good luck  </s>
<s> i am doing exactly what you are trying to do.  </s>
<s> transfer old lps to my hard-drive and to cds (i assume).  </s>
<s> i guess ignorance is bliss, because i installed realplayer (after many annoying pop-ups, etc.) and found that for $19.95 i could have (among other things) the option of recording from &quot;line-in&quot; or &quot;mic&quot; jacks on my sound card.  </s>
<s> all i did then was run a cable from the &quot;phones&quot; jack on my old turntable to the &quot;line-in&quot; jack on my sound card.  </s>
<s> after opening realplayer, i chose &quot;record from line-in or mic&quot; and followed the step-by-step procedure which was kind of intuitive.  </s>
<s> with a few trial & error guesses, you will be off and running!  </s>
<s> i have not found this option with windows media player, and queries to ms produced no satisfactory replys except for computer generated &quot;faq&quot; answers.  </s>
<s> if they can't be bothered, neither can i.  </s>
<s> i am also recording over to cd. all i did was run a cable from my stereo to my computers line in...i use the program called sound capture.  </s>
<s> only bad part is 60min of music takes 60min to record as said earlier.  </s>
<s> has the program and its free just like all things that are wonderful.  </s>
