<s> i have a 60gb maxtor hdd with 2 partitions and ~6gb unallocated space.  </s>
<s> one of the partition is running windows xp pro, while the other one is empty.  </s>
<s> then i have a 6gb western digital hdd with windows 2000 pro installed.  </s>
<s> this hdd is running out of space - just under 1g left.  </s>
<s> now what should i do if i want that old 6gb hdd to be copied entirely without losing anything, into the 2nd partition of the *new* 60gb hdd? is it possible?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> but the os will no longer function.  </s>
<s> i decline to duplicate web content about why this is so but you need the windows 2000 cd to have any hope of repairing the os after such a move.  </s>
<s> good luck, bob  </s>
<s> even though the new hdd is on the same computer?  </s>
<s> does it apply to windows 2000 only or just any windows versions?  </s>
<s> and should the copying be cloning or imaging?  </s>
<s> i'll be very glad if you can recommend me to a freeware or no-restriction shareware of doing that.  </s>
<s> copy, clone, image, etc. all result in a non-operational os but at least you didn't lose any files.  </s>
<s> some may demand that the os work after such but i decline to duplicate all the web pages why windows fails after such a move.  </s>
<s> for your research type change motherboard save windows at google.com bob  </s>
