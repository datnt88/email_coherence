i am planing to buy used laptop. 
do you have any advices how can i choose the right one. 
i don`t want to buy something bad. 
this one i added: 512 ram - $59.00 - crucial intel wireless lan - $15.00 - ebay (software from intel free) docking station - $5.00 - ebay excellent little machine. 
if you want to use windows, make sure the seller includes a valid copy of the windows cd (or mfg restoration cd's) and the product key. 
alternative: - spend us$100+ extra on a new windows cd - install your favorite linux 
with all that on your web site, your post seems wildly out of sorts in some odd way. 
tell what your plans are.
