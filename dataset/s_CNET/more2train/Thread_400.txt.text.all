<s> i am currently upgrading my pc to a home theatre pc and will be connecting my pc to a 50' samsung dlp hdtv and i was looking for some advice on a graphics card.  </s>
<s> i do not play video games on my computer so game graphics are not important to me, i just want some advice on the best graphics cards for outputting hd.  </s>
<s> ati typically has better video processing according to benchmarks.  </s>
<s> if you plan on displaying blu-ray/hd dvd content get a radeon x16xx or geforce x76xx or better.  </s>
<s> both are less than $100 and the extra 3-d horsepower won't hurt.  </s>
<s> you should find one with a little more search.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
