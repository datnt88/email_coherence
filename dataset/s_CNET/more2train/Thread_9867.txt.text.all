<s> my computer has a year old cd/dvd drive and a blu-ray drive that can do cd/dvd as well, but both see to be having troubles playing audio cds. it will find the cd, but will only play part of tracks 1 and 9. and in the computer selection it says the audio cd has 0 bytes free of 0 bytes.  </s>
<s> my os is 32 bit vista ultimate.  </s>
<s> does anyone know a solution?  </s>
<s> yes, audio cd always show 0 bytes.  </s>
<s> you have to download audio songs in your computer then try to play, i also make sure you that audio songs only download through windows media player.  </s>
<s> if you download through copy and paste they donot play.  </s>
<s> so, download through wmp.  </s>
<s> the tracks will read as 44 bytes and it will come up with an error when i try to rip it.  </s>
