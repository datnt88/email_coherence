<s> hello, i am totally new to netbooks and have only had my laptop for about 1 year.  </s>
<s> i am not a techinal person when it comes to computers.  </s>
<s> i can't tell you what the difference between a gigabit and a megabit is.  </s>
<s> lol when i have a question i have to get my kids to come and help me! it is sad i know.  </s>
<s> but i am wanting to buy my kids notebooks or netbooks for christmas.  </s>
<s> i have two 15 yr old boys and an 8 yr old girl.  </s>
<s> they will all get their own.  </s>
<s> my question is can they use a netbook with a wireless printer to print school assignments.  </s>
<s> can i block their computer somehow so they don't get on adult websites?  </s>
<s> and last question...i have a internet card for my laptop...will they be able to pickup that signal on their netbooks?  </s>
<s> or will i have to go to a wireless motum?  </s>
<s> they are smart as can be on computers but i do not allow them on my computer, because it is for work not their games.  </s>
<s> thanks for your help!  </s>
<s> a netbook is just the same as a laptop, but it's smaller, lighter and slower, it has a keyboard that's unsuitable to type on, a screen that's too small for everyday use, it usually doesn't have a cd- or dvd-drive and it's hardly suitable to play games.  </s>
<s> it's hardly imagineable somebody would buy one as their primary machine.  </s>
<s> but it's nice if you go backpacking and want to check your mail, provided you can find a hotspot for the internet access.  </s>
<s> most netbooks come with windows xp, although you might find others with linux or windows 7. so to answer your questions: 1. yes, you can use it with a wireless printer (provided it has a driver for the os on the netbook).  </s>
<s> 2. yes, you can use the same parental control options as on your own laptop.  </s>
<s> that's totally independent of the hardware.  </s>
<s> but don't expect too much from that.  </s>
<s> 3. a wireless modem/router is a very good thing to use to connect to the internet from 2 or 3 or 4 laptops simultaneously.  </s>
<s> kees  </s>
<s> yes, you will be able to use a wireless printer for printing documents.  </s>
<s> most notebooks and netbooks sold today have built in wireless capabilities.  </s>
<s> no worries on setting that up, that must be found on the manual.  </s>
<s> if you need information more about handling laptops go to this link: now for blocking internet access, i totally agree with you on that.  </s>
<s> your kids should always be protected from violence in the internet.  </s>
<s> the internet is a great learning tool and it can be made safe provided you have the right tools at hand.  </s>
