<s> i spent weeks with the d-link tech folks, who are as frustrated as their customers.  </s>

<s> retailer was newegg, who referred me to the mfg for refund... d-link referred me back to retailer.  </s>

<s> rebooting was required every 5 to 10 minutes, and was the suggested remedy by d-link tech support.  </s>
<s> that, and trying various firmwares.  </s>
<s> all of which made little difference.  </s>
<s> replacing the router was the most effective solution.  </s>
<s> newegg is where to focus. the product is defective and the money went from you to newegg.  </s>
<s> if by cc, call them and explain that the product was defective from day one and what to do next.  </s>
<s> i've used far too many routers but the recurring advice is to use our forum's preferred settings.  </s>
