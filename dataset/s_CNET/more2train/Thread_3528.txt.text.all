hello everybody. 
this is my first post and i did look for help before posting this. 
what i have is a sanyo m1 3g enabled phone from sprint with the evdo high speed network and i just got two of there new high speed wireless data cards.one 
for the home computer and one for mobile laptop . 
i think this is the best out there for doing streaming viedo. 
what i am trying to work on at the moment is selecting a 3g camera for the house and view my property on my phone and laptop at a remote location. 
i want an outdoor camera . 
this is what is confusing to me is the 3g term..is this something that is strictly wireless or what. 
i bought x10 cameras a while back and i do not like these at all so i need some good advice on where to start and what camera to purchase. 
i plan to do the tv slibbox unit also. 
i got all of this new tech power and i want to try it out. 
thak you for youre replys in advance mike 
must be a tough one..this is a 3g forum isn't it? 
here's an example question. 
-&gt; is the sky blue? 
notice the trailing question mark. 
i read you (ill formed) post and while you hinted at something you might want, a question never appeared.
