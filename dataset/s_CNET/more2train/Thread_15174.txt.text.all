my dvd does not recognize discs inside, when you insert a disc it happens...nothing. 
all drivers were reinstalled successfully and system properties show that dvd is running correctly but it remains the same. 
any kind of disc is recognized. 
my operating system is windows me. 
thanks 
has this just been instaled or when was the last time that it worked, need more info.

hi, here i am again!. dvd has been installed once more and it doesn't work. 
drivers are properly reinstalled, and the last time it works was a few months ago... something curious is that dvd is recognized by system, however it remains bad.
