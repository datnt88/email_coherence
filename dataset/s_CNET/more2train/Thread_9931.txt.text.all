<s> you say nothing of your system, os, installed software etc. some more information would help to determine if it is an issue related to hardware or software, at this point it is difficult to say.  </s>
<s> did the drive (system) run disks normally in the past?  </s>
<s> again a bit more information.  </s>
<s> 1. autoplay has been disabled for years.  </s>
<s> it had to die because it was exploited.  </s>
<s> 2. you need to tell more.  </s>
<s> if the cd contents show in explorer (which is that app that fires up when you open &quot;my computer&quot;) then we're partway there.  </s>
<s> shows xp and vista support only.  </s>
