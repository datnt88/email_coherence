i have several apps that can be used either &quot;stand-alone&quot; or installed. 
will portable apps run faster than installed versions of the same software? 
to benchmark them. 
i can find cases for either so only a benchmark will tell. 
with the limited capabilities of netbook processors, it might be interesting to see some one do some benchmark tests of these programs. 
i have firefox in both versions and see no difference, but i am running them on a laptop. the new asus eee pc 1005ha-pu1x (xp) will be here friday!
