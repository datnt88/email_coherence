<s> hello everyone!  </s>
<s> i need some advice on what pc to buy, because i don't understand much of a pc's specifications.  </s>
<s> i'm going to mainly use it for games, movies etc. so i want a good and a fast pc. here's the ones i consider buying, but i don't know which one.  </s>
<s> so please, can you please read through the specifications.  </s>
<s> i have compared them all three there: you can press on the green button &quot;marker forskellene&quot; and it will highlight the differences.  </s>
<s> i don't think you really need to understand danish, as it is mostly numbers.  </s>
<s> which one should i go for, to play quality games and movies on great settings.  </s>
<s> intel core or amd?  </s>
<s> which one of the pcs has the greatest graphic card - nvidia geforce or amd radeon?  </s>
<s> can any of those pcs run games like battlefield 3, max payne 3 etc on highest settings?  </s>
<s> please help out.  </s>
<s> i really hope to get some good advices.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> please ignore the third pc. i'm only interested in the first and the second pc now.  </s>
<s> that gt620 doesn't even make anyone's list.  </s>
<s> your &quot;gamer&quot; will select a gpu from a list like this list.  </s>
<s> -&gt; the i5 is a great choice.  </s>
<s> why do i write that?  </s>
<s> &quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.  </s>
<s> it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines.  </s>
<s> &quot; bob  </s>
<s> hey. i'm not really a hardcore gamer (as some would say), just an average gamer that would like to play once in a while.  </s>
<s> i don't need to have maxed out the setings.  </s>
<s> i could be running on low settings for all i care.  </s>
<s> but i want a smooth pc with a great performance and it should be fast.  </s>
<s> i should be able to play those games, maybe not on highest, but medium would definitely do.  </s>
<s> so now my choice is either the first pc or the second one. the first one has a 3rd generation cpu, the second one has 2nd.  </s>
<s> does it matter much?  </s>
<s> what is cpu cache?  </s>
<s> seems like the second one is a bit lower on that.  </s>
<s> but would it matter, since the second one has a ram of 12gb?  </s>
<s> what about the ram speed (mhz).  </s>
<s> would i be able to feel any difference? the graphic card - which is better nvidia geforce gt620 or amd radeon hd 7470? the processor - which is better: intel core i5 or amd a10 vision?  </s>
<s> would it be the latter one, since it has 4 cpu's and the other one has 2? i heard that i5 should be better though?  </s>
<s> i'm sorry for all these questions, but i don't know a lot on this subject.  </s>
<s> thank you for your help and i hope you can answer all my silly questions!  </s>
<s> it's like drag racing in the family van.  </s>
<s> doesn't do well at all.  </s>
<s> you have a good base but the 620 video card is a problem.  </s>
<s> as to the 7470, it may be better.  </s>
<s> hit up tomshardware for scores.  </s>
<s> as to the cpu, you picked a winner.  </s>
<s> i would not change that.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hey bob.  </s>
<s> i think i might go ahead and buy this: what do you think? is it much better than the ones i suggested above?  </s>
<s> you can view the specifications bottom of the page.  </s>
<s> shows it has dual rails of 17a each.  </s>
<s> you will sometimes see those start to falter in a year or two.  </s>
<s> at least you know ahead of time.  </s>
<s> good value selections but i would have stuck with the i5. bob  </s>
<s> the powersupply will start to falter in a year or two?  </s>
<s> really?  </s>
<s> would you say that's the only disadvantage of this pc? could you take a look at this link: under &quot;stromforsyninger&quot; (means powersupply), there's a list of power supplies to choose.  </s>
<s> which one would you then recommend?  </s>
<s> i only noted the issue because if you are in the forums, that combination shows up in a year or 2 with odd failures.  </s>
<s> remember it's not that all will do that.  </s>
<s> but it's an odd choice of products so my guess is it's about the money.  </s>
<s> sorry but there are dozens of options at that link.  </s>
<s> your prior posts looked fine as far as a working pc. as you narrowed it done i took a quick dive into the psu specs to see if it would be a single or more rail.  </s>
<s> i'd want a single rail for this setup or 20+amperes on the +12v rail.  </s>
<s> this is not an offer to write a dissertation on psu selection.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> find what amperes you will be putting on each &quot;rail&quot;.  </s>
<s> it does not have to be exact but it should the numbers &quot;under load.&quot; now double that and add up the resulting watts.  </s>
<s> for a long life pc you'll want rails that you never exceed 50% of the amperes for each rail and for total watts you don't want to exceed 50% of the total watts the psu is rated for.  </s>
<s> if you're read power supply shootouts like and others you learn that those ratings are usually optimistic and after a year or two are not to be believed as the part ages and loses capacity.  </s>
<s> sure you can go higher on the 50% mark and many use the 75 or 80% of the rating but it's your design.  </s>
<s> make it a good one.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> hey! i had a friend to help me and he told me this would do the job: what do you think?  </s>
<s> seems nice enough.  </s>
<s> will keep you out of trouble for some time.  </s>
