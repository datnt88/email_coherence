i want to get a (not too expensive) scanner for scanning in b+w negatives i'm taking for school (and probably color negatives in the future) but also for general scanning in documents etc. any suggestions? 
i know i once saw a scanner that was a regular scanner but then had a frame that you put negatives in and put that on the scanner bed, and it would automatically crop and resize all the negatives-is this a common feature or only available in higher price scanners? 
(i'm using windows xp sp2) 
i had to find it for you. 
look here and you'll be able to figure out, after research, what you need to do this. 
best i could do.
