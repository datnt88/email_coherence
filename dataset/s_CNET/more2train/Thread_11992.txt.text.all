<s> i have a dell dimension e510 with the original 160gb hard drive.  </s>
<s> i would like to replace it with a 1tb seagate hard drive.  </s>
<s> is this possible or will i need to replace the processor, etc to handle this size?  </s>
<s> any help will be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> just tell if it's a sata or ide drive.  </s>
<s> many discover this after the change.  </s>
<s> visit the dell support website and under support enter your s/n or order# and whatever they suggest to enter and proceed to find out the day it was build what was put in.  </s>
<s> if unable to determine, then be sure to at least open case, look at the physical hd to see what it is, ide or sata type.  </s>
<s> then as already suggested by robert order the new replacement that of similar type.  </s>
<s> most hd vendor provide thier own support for their products and they will provide some details of adding the new 1tb hd problems that may arise, so review the q&a/help files on the topic.  </s>
<s> i strongly suggest you make a working backup of your current hd. on this matter, typical vendor hd s/w provided will transfer(mirror image) just like the old hd was setup as, then remove old hd and use new hd alone.  </s>
<s> as for 1tb replacement, i see no issue here, it should work.  </s>
<s> i do suggest you look-up(review) for any bios updates from dell and what they do update or address, they *maybe* needed to proceed.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i provide this to show what hds are being offered for your system as replacements/upgrades or additions: enjoy -----willy  </s>
<s> i appreciate your assistance and the time you took to respond.  </s>
