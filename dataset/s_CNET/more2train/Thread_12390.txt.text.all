hey im trying to figure out the chipset on this p4ht .... help! 
that's not a chipset on that page, but a cpu. 
bob 
see 
there is no chipset on it. 
chipsets are on motherboards not on cpus 
so intel 865p and 875p chipsets will support it. 
there are also mobos with via, nvidia, and sis chipsets that will support it. 
go to and read the articles on mobo's that support that cpu or articles by chipset type.
