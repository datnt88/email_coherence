<s> i am in the market for an external hard drive, usb 2.0 to be exact.  </s>
<s> i am wondering what is the best way to go about it.  </s>
<s> should i get one that is already put together like the maxtor or should i make on by buying an external case and hd. is doing it on your own stable? is it reliable?  </s>
<s> if you can help recommend solutions like what brand of case and hd or whatever, id appreciate it.  </s>
<s> thanx in advance.  </s>
<s> shop the sales at bb,cc, fry's, newegg, pricewatch.com  </s>
<s> etc. the first one i assembled the 2nd one was pre built they both work.  </s>
<s> get one that has a good rebate.  </s>
<s> john  </s>
<s> i recently purchased two usb2 only enclosures from newegg for 34 bucks each (free shipping too) and had no problems.  </s>
<s> these were plain (no neons) aluminum boxes and are made fairly well.  </s>
<s> when the drives fail (and it's when and not if ), i should be able to replace them easily.  </s>
<s> i think i saved a bit by going this route.  </s>
<s> i have an older maxtor 40 gb usb drive that just went. the usb port was working but when i removed the hd and put it in one of my pcs to check, it wasn't recognized.  </s>
<s> i tried a new replacement maxtor 40 ( i don't know the interface protocol ) but it's dead behind the port.  </s>
<s> so i guess there's some interface rules that have to be observed.  </s>
<s> maybe, the maxtor usb will only work with select maxtor hds.  </s>
<s> so get the rules first.  </s>
<s> like which class of drives will work, and hopefully will be available a year or two from now.  </s>
<s> i recently bought a lacie 80gb external usb 2.0 drive from buy.com for $85 and have been pleasantly surpised with its quality and performance.  </s>
<s> if you have windows xp it is just plug and play. it has a fat32 format but can be reformatted to ntfs in about 20 mins.  </s>
<s> also, it has an off/on switch which is convenient.  </s>
<s> all documentation (manual) is on the cd.  </s>
