<s> i have moved into a retirement village - private homes as well as aggregate ones - where there is very little communication amongst residents other than neighbor-to-neighbor and a weekly calendar put out by the central administration.  </s>
<s> i'm told that about 50% of the residents have email and some do get a blast from the admin in emergencies, or of course exchange email amongst themselves.  </s>
<s> i would like to instigate a move to get people using a localized &quot;bulletin board&quot; - facebook or google plus - and a calendar, probably the google one.  </s>
<s> not everyone can afford an ipad, but i'm sure many have kindles and the like and/or smartphones.  </s>
<s> my experience is with ipads/iphone.  </s>
<s> how good are the non-ipad tablets at doing internet stuff?  </s>
<s> can you recommend what list.cnet.remains  </s>
<s> s.cnet.train  </s>
<s> scripts should recommend to them?  </s>
<s> has anyone had experience implementing this in a community like this? i'd like advice!!  </s>
<s> but wouldn't you test drive those before recommending?  </s>
<s> did you try the new kindle fire hd? it's email is very good.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> but i couldn't possibly buy them all, and i want to know if, say, the cheaper kindles really work with web apps like facebook and google.  </s>
<s> you don't upset me in the least.  </s>
<s> maybe in this election season, i'm more leery of advertisements that promise more than they deliver, which is why i want real-life experiences with the different tablets.  </s>
<s> the kf hd is what i'd try first.  </s>
<s> it's email is surprisingly good. the other apps are all-in.  </s>
<s> i'm only a software developer but if i was asked this question, the kf hd gets first place.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> chrome book microsoft tablet surface.  </s>
<s> chrome book is very good in internet app, surface is powerful as a laptop.  </s>
<s> no visual studio so how to match what i do on a laptop today?  </s>
<s> i have a nook color which is very easy to use and i can surf the web and watch netflix movies as well as read books. the new ones have excellent displays and will cost much less than the ipad.  </s>
<s> if you want a camera for skyping, you will need to look elsewhere as nook has no camera.  </s>
<s> since i have an android phone and tablet.  </s>
<s> basically all androids will have the same options for email.  </s>
<s> one disadvantage of the kindle is it's a modified version of android and not all android apps with run on it.  </s>
<s> i myself love my samsung.  </s>
<s> i'm a senior, retired, but very atypical, in that i'm a long time computer & smart phone guy.  </s>
<s> i also provide it support for my church and i get this kind of question pretty often.  </s>
<s> like bob, i have a preference for windows and android over apple.  </s>
<s> but if you surveyed the population you're talking about it's probably more iphones & ipads than anything else.  </s>
<s> if that is the case, then i'd say go with apple and let them help each other.  </s>
<s> iphone, ipad, ipad mini, ipod touch offer a consistent experience.  </s>
<s> refurbs, ipad mini, previous generation ipads are all ways to get in at a lower cost.  </s>
<s> on the other hand, kindle and nook are both good tablets, too.  </s>
<s> both offer a curated app store so there are fewer choices, and that's important for people in a retirement village.  </s>
<s> both do wifi and email very competently.  </s>
<s> i prefer the nook line (nook color, nook tablet and the new nook hd and hd+) because they are more open.  </s>
<s> kindle has a strong preference for the amazon ecosystem for books, movies and tv. nook relies more on commercial apps like netflix, hulu, etc. significant differences in the latest offerings are: - kindle has a front facing camera; nook has no camera - kindle's low priced tablets are ad supported, nooks are ad free - nook tablets have a micro sd card slot for added storage, kindles don't have a way to add storage - both nook and kindle highlight their email and calendar apps for what it's worth, the other bob  </s>
<s> you can order it without that as well.  </s>
<s> for me it was worth the (current) 15 bucks.  </s>
<s> i have the nook and as the office placed orders for the kindles we'll have them next week so we can see if we can get our apps on them.  </s>
<s> -&gt; email support looks great on the kf hd so far.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> it's probabably best not to try to &quot;replace&quot; a laptop with a tablet, just compliment it.  </s>
<s> we are porting apps to android among other things.  </s>
<s> but i continue to find people thinking that today's tablets and apps are ready to replace the apple or windows laptop.  </s>
<s> not yet.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> your rationale behind apple is sound, and i hadn't really thought of it.  </s>
<s> i have been investigating, and most people around here who have kindles read books, period.  </s>
<s> i don't think the camera is too big a deal but maybe it is.  </s>
<s> i did find one woman who uses a kindle fire for all sorts of things, which means that if i do a presentation i should invite her to join me.  </s>
<s> so thanks, for understanding exactly what i was looking for.  </s>
<s> a few years back everyone here was saying everyone (even grandma) should get linux computers.  </s>
<s> i don't hear that often any more. the ability to understand that what you may want or enjoy isn't necessarily what everyone should get perhaps come with maturity and experience.  </s>
<s> thanks again!  </s>
<s> i just purchased a samsung galaxy tab2 .. mini tablet .. love it .. and i'm 71 3/4s! it is android os, can get kindle app as well as nook app, many many apps, as well as email, internet, etc .. and it fits easily into a purse/messanger bag-type to carry with you.  </s>
<s> of course the best thing is the cost .. i had originally purchased the kindle fire hd to replace my several years old kindle keyboard .. then started looking at the difference in price between it ($199) and having a 'real' computer - the samsung was $249 .. so for $50 more i received much more and i love it!  </s>
<s> but i find many people - young and old, who really don't even know what visual studio is, much less want to use it, or many other standard pc apps, on anything.  </s>
<s> they are quite content to do the web, email, simple editing of photos, skype maybe, watch movies and tv and play a few or many games.  </s>
<s> there are reasonably bearable office programs if need be and i've found i can also use salesforce and wordpress on my ipad, the main limitation being the keyboard (which i could correct if need be).  </s>
<s> however, obviously, there are a great many it apps that are not and will not be ported to tablets.  </s>
<s> i'm retired - no longer interested in the corporate world's needs, and if there is one app to make a power-point presentation, that's one app too many!!  </s>
