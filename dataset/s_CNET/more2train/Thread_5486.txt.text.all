im trying to get a wireless network going at work. 
ive been using a public hotspot across the street, but they shut down shop. 
my work has a lan, but i dont prefer to use that and i cant figure out how to get their router to work with my wireless router! 
heres what i have available. 
a work computer with a secure lan my house 1 mile away with cable internet and a belkin wireless router several local hotspots (secured and i dont wanna crack them) a telephone pole with a gigantic cb antenna for a commercial two way radio (i have access to the radio). 
ive had alot of ideas but cant materialize any of them. 
go to work guys!!! 
go get a wireless access card and service from your cellular company and it will work in most places without much fuss.

ask your boss or it department.

yeah i thought about the aircard. 
would an at&t aircard be sufficient for online gaming (i.e. counter-strike)? 
i like to game when im at home.
