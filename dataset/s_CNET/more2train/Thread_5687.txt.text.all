<s> i have a lite on cdrw 52x24x52.  </s>
<s> when i burn cdr i can only burn at 32x and cdrw i can only burn at 8x. why is this happing?  </s>
<s> my system specs are: 1800 amdxp processer 256 mb ram 80gig hd  </s>
<s> just because you have a x-rated burn factor, doesn't mean it will achieve that at every burn.  </s>
<s> depending on the media being burnt can be a limiting factor, even if the disk being burnt is rated for such use, varying brands can make a big difference so shop around for the best suited from actual experience.  </s>
<s> on top of that as the burner gets older it will deteriate from its top levels.  </s>
<s> add to that the system overall performance as well for copying from source.  </s>
<s> next, a cleaning now and then may help in overall lasting performance.  </s>
<s> also, the burner may need an update from the manufacturer as the os or pgms.  </s>
<s> involved could be hitting a wall, thus check for your model if one is available.  </s>
<s> if you haven't already check the setting for the burning s/w and see what the defaults are, but expect some falling back if the burning process encounters a problem as its &quot;burn-proof&quot; scheme may allow *best* operation so you don't create coasters.  </s>
<s> check this website for possible clues as well: there maybe others better to answer your question, but alot of this comes from my experience and just covers the basics.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> 32 x burning is actually too fast to be burning most items that may require low error rates.  </s>
<s> it has been written in a number of columns that the maximum you should be burning at is 24-32x as beyond that will cause increased errors as well you should be burning in disc at once for music.  </s>
<s> now the other thing that will affect your burning rates are the software you are using if your using a demo version of say nero or roxio they will after the trial limit the burning speed that can be attained.  </s>
<s> if youa re using an older version of burning software you may need to upgrade the software.  </s>
<s> one other thing to make sure of is that the discs that you purchase are capable of handling and recommended for the speed of your burner.  </s>
<s> i personally burn nothing over 24-32x depending on what i am burning and if i am really mission critical i will burn at 4x for some things.  </s>
<s> i can wait the extra minute it may take, if it means one less coffee coaster.  </s>
<s> always remember fast is not always good.  </s>
<s> ron  </s>
<s> take ron's advice and slow that burner down a little.  </s>
<s> if you're burning at 32x with 256 mb ram, you should be getting buffer underruns.  </s>
<s> you can burn a full cd in about 4 minutes at 24x, how fast is fast?  </s>
<s> why do you think the manufacturers stopped with the 52x burners?  </s>
<s> it's because most computers aren't capable of running the drive that fast anyway. the technology is ahead of it's time.  </s>
<s> you also should be seeing the led on the front of the burner going out from time to time during a burn.  </s>
<s> that's so the computer can catch up to the burner, because the burner is running too fast.  </s>
<s> so unless you just happen to need more coasters, slow it down to 24x or even 12x or 16x.  </s>
<s> some discount, bulk media is labeled... &quot;52x compatible.&quot; it didn't write the media was 52x capable, just that it would work in a 52x drive... as to the cdrw speed, i think i see most cdrw media is still 4x and if you look around you find some 8, 10 and 12x cdrw disks.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks eveyone for your help. it seems the media i was using is rated at 4x i didnt think the media mattered and it was the burner that determend the speed.  </s>
