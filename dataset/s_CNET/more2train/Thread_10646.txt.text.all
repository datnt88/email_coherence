<s> all pc's are less than 3 years old (6 pc's total), and all are running windows xp pro.  </s>
<s> we have all the neccesary hardware (nic's, router, switch, modem, etc.).  </s>
<s> two of the six pc's have very slow network reaction time.  </s>
<s> internet (we have broadband), transferring files, everything.  </s>
<s> i can't figure out why this is.  </s>
<s> i've replaced the two cat5 cables with cat6 cables and the problem still persists.  </s>
<s> i've tried switching ports on the workgroup switch and still nothing.  </s>
<s> i've also tried replacing the router, switch, and modem.  </s>
