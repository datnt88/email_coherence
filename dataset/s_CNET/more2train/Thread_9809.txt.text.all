<s> i want to build a pc but i have no experience with hardware.  </s>
<s> i've watched tutorials on how to build a pc and done some research on hardware and this is the build i came up with.  </s>
<s> i'd appreciate some feedback before i spend $900.  </s>
<s> i want to be able to play games like skyrim on at least high settings with a ton of mods.  </s>
<s> this may not quite pull that off due to budget issues (or will it?). could you rate my build 1-10 for how well it should work for that?  </s>
<s> motherboard cpu gpu hdd ram dvd psu case os $861 + shipping.  </s>
<s> how does this look?  </s>
<s> am i missing anything (besides monitor/mouse/keyboard)?  </s>
<s> that's nine web pages to pull up.  </s>
<s> i pulled just one and it was the psu.  </s>
<s> i would not buy that today.  </s>
<s> i want a single 12v rail to avoid having to balance the rails or even having to know to do that.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ram. native support is 1333......don't handicap it with slow ram.  </s>
<s> psu.  </s>
<s> you can get that tri-rail thing if you want.  </s>
<s> i'd be looking for a single rail......600w.  </s>
<s> corsair or pc power+cooling have some nice units.  </s>
<s> sorry, don't know how to put it all in one link.  </s>
<s> what do you think of these?  </s>
<s> ram psu  </s>
<s> i have that case.  </s>
<s> it's simple and sturdy but only two fans come with it.  </s>
<s> i added variable speed fans in the front and keep all fans at a fairly low rpm.  </s>
<s> quiet is what i like.  </s>
<s> look here i try to check a mb manufacturer's list of compatible ram first.  </s>
<s> if i can't find what's on the list, i go to crucial dot com to see if they have the ram known to be compatible with the board i have.  </s>
<s> my budget's just about maxed out and i don't know anything about fans or how much room i'll have for one.  </s>
<s> so you're going to generate heat.  </s>
<s> i'm fairly certain the cpu won't overclock so that won't be an issue.  </s>
<s> i don't game but i do have extra hard drives and use the 10k rpm type.  </s>
<s> as well, i went with a passive cooled video card as those with fans can be noisier and need more in the way of maintenance.  </s>
<s> such are of my reasons for adding fans to the front panel.  </s>
<s> it's up to you but gaming adds a different dimension.  </s>
<s> you're video card will toss hot air into the case and that hot air needs to be removed.  </s>
<s> you can try it without extra fans and see how it works.  </s>
<s> my two extra fans cost about 30 bucks for both.  </s>
<s> psu looks fine.  </s>
<s> ram.  </s>
<s> should work......if not look here.  </s>
