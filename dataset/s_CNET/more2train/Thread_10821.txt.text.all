i am planning to buy a bluetooth donlge for my laptop, but then wondered: would it be possible to connect my phone to my laptop (via the cable or infra-red) and then use the bluetooth on the phone, making my phone itself the bluetooth dongle. 
unleashing it's power to my laptop. 
i have a nokia 6230, a toshiba equium laptop (with usb and infra red), a nokia connectivity cable and windows xp home sp2 any tech-wizard up for the challenge? 
will nokia reveal how to talk to the phone? 
these areas are what i call closed source and not open for most if not all tinkerers. the amount of time to reverse engineer such can be too high except for those that want to invest the time.
