<s> i was in walle over the weekend to pick up a router for vacation home (single level modular home with router installed in back right corner bedroom).  </s>
<s> started with the cheapest which was the belkin n300($40).  </s>
<s> top signal bars with phone and laptop through out home.  </s>
<s> stable range and connection for 2 days.  </s>
<s> read reviews and specs and noticed no wireless printing.  </s>
<s> packed up and returned for netgear n300 ($50) which specs.  </s>
<s> wireless printing.  </s>
<s> dropped a bar each for phone and laptop and unstable connection with phone.  </s>
<s> returned and will try another next time i'm down there.  </s>
<s> they had a cisco (e1200 or e1500 can't remember at $60).  </s>
<s> i'll test this one next time i'm down there (400 miles away).  </s>
<s> no time to thoroughly test and both routers left to default settings although the netgear was set to 150 mbps and i changed to 300 mbps with no better results.  </s>
<s> didn't read up on this router class but i will before purchasing another.  </s>
<s> i have the cisco e4200 at my home and have had no issues except for the blinking logo which a firmware fixed.  </s>
<s> looking for advice.  </s>
<s> thanks, mike  </s>
<s> this is pretty much the standard why is there so much difference of opinion on what router works best.  </s>
<s> when you deal with radio waves you have both the router design and the location it is running in to content with.  </s>
<s> a router that works great in one house may work poorly in another.  </s>
<s> almost impossible to predict this so other than what you are doing keep trying until you get one that works for you.  </s>
<s> when tested in very controlled conditions there is not a lot of difference between routers so this leaves the persons house.  </s>
<s> you best bet may be to use the belkin you know works well and buy a usb print server and plug that into the router.  </s>
<s> i am assuming this is what you mean by wireless printing since if you have a printer that has wireless already you don't need anything special on the router.  </s>
<s> thanks for your input.  </s>
<s> these are the model #'s i briefly tested.  </s>
<s> looks like i would have to step up to the belkin n600 for wireless printing support according to website.  </s>
<s> most likely the printer will be hardwired to the router though.  </s>
<s> just didn't have time to get that far and might not make it back to vacation home for another 3 months which is beyond walle return.  </s>
<s> next time i'm down there i will buy both the belkin n600 and cisco equivalent to the 2 i've tested already.  </s>
<s> see which one fits the bill.  </s>
<s> just wasn't sure if a laptop would be able to print to the printer even if the printer was hardwired.  </s>
<s> wish i would have had more time to test.  </s>
<s> just got off the phone with belkin.  </s>
<s> not an issue for me since the printer is in the same room as the router.  </s>
<s> i'll repurchase and try it next time i'm down there.  </s>
<s> excellent signal strength.  </s>
<s> only can hope it will retain a connection but for $40 its worth the risk for me.  </s>
<s> trying not to over buy for my needs.  </s>
<s> what i have. the d-link dir-655.  </s>
<s> excellent router for a little more money.  </s>
<s> it consistently gets the best reviews.  </s>
