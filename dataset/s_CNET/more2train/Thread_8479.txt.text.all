<s> and do you have to have windows vista to run dx 10? thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> yes, you guessed it.  </s>
<s> dx10 is vista only.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> dx10 is the breaking point to get vista.  </s>
<s> well, it seems ms wants users to be more vista ready and pony up the $. don't look for dx10 capable games to under xp, unless they provide a solution with their s/w bundle(not likely).  </s>
<s> but heck, it still early since vista was released and all the issues it imposes.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> thanks for the info.  </s>
<s> i was planning on upgrading my video card to dx 10 to play &quot;world in conflict&quot; thats coming out in september.  </s>
<s> no way i'm gonna fork over the cash for a new os, dx 10 card, power supply, and probably a cooling unit to boot.  </s>
<s> there's still a lot of dx 9 games out there to keep me satisfied for awhile.  </s>
