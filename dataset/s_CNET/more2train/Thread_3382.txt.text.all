<s> i am building a pc to mainly work with raw image converters, photoshop and create dvd slideshows, so a bit of graphic work, but not really any 3d stuff.  </s>
<s> firstly, can someone suggest a decent motherboard with intel 775 socket and 1066mhz fsb that would do the job.  </s>
<s> looking at around $150 us (&lt;$200 aus would be good) secondly, is there any need for a graphics card with the integrated graphics included with the motherboard and what is a good card to go for?  </s>
<s> cheers, alex  </s>
<s> sorry i'm not there but if you want top cpu performance and not worried about 3d gaming even the lowest end video card (current models please) will do fine.  </s>
<s> one of our best video editing machines (stable, fast, etc) had a 4mb video card.  </s>

<s> look for a motherboard based on the intel g33 or p35 chipsets.  </s>
<s> the g33 has integrated graphics.  </s>
<s> for your type of work, you don't need a discrete graphics card, but if you stick with integrated graphics you'll be limited to one monitor.  </s>
<s> (dual monitors are great for the type of work you mentioned.) so, i suggest you get an inexpensive graphics card based on either the nvidia geforce 8400gs or the ati radeon hd 2400pro.  </s>
<s> motherboards, $90-$115 usd: gigabyte ga-p35-ds3l msi p35 neo2-fr graphics, $40 usd: msi nx8400gs-td256eh geforce 8400gs gigabyte gv-nx84g256he geforce 8400gs msi rx2400pro-td256eh radeon hd 2400pro  </s>
