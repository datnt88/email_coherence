have figured out that i would want to go for an android one. 
have shortlisted, 
that all tablets and just a little less capable in those web browsers and video playback. 
i've encountered folk very upset as they figure that out. 
you listed some nice tablets and given you want to watch videos, maybe the one with the longest battery run time would be the winner for you.

this review says the sony's battery is low.
