i got an idea for a budget system... if u get the 300mb or 640 mb and oc will it be as fast as the gtx? 
ocing my 7900gtx improoved the performance alot 
the lower end had a 500mhz core, 1400mhz mem clock and didnt metion shader clock the high end had 575 mhz core, 1800mhz mem, and 1350 mhz shader clock if they both have a shader clock i believe u could buy an 8800 gts instead of gtx and oc and get the same results.i 
really dont think that 200 some odd mb memory is gonna make a diffirence. 
no, not really, this is cuz some hardware specs cannot be changed e.g uni. 
shader, gtx has128, gts has 96. that aint really poss. 
to oc, although you do realize there is a limit how far you can actuallt oc. you will get improved performance but i reallly dont thing youll match the gtx by just ocing!!
