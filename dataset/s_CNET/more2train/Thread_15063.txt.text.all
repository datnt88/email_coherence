<s> through trial and error, and the proper software, i know how to burn mp3's to cd, and burn movies to dvd.  </s>
<s> but i have a jvc in dash dvd player in my car and would like to burn mp3's to dvd since the capacity is much greater.  </s>
<s> i am unsure which programs i could use.  </s>
<s> i would appreciate any experience or recommendations on programs that will achieve this?  </s>
<s> thanks much, scott.  </s>
<s> the player only support mp3 on cd. so just toss your up to 99 mp3 files on the dvdr and spin it.  </s>

<s> i have tried this before, but it did not work on my player becasue when i burned them i had to make it a jukebox disc(???)and it would only play on my computer through windows jukebox, but it wasnt burned by jukebox, it was a totally seperate software.  </s>
