<s> i am currently expanding my home network to support a digital movie library (both sd and hd) and am looking for some recommentations on network storage that i can incremental expand as my storage requriements increase.  </s>
<s> my needs are for media streaming over my 1000mbps network and centralized backup.  </s>
<s> i have looked as some of the windows home server soultions, but would prefer an network device, so i don't have the hassle of another windows operating system to manage.  </s>
<s> i have looked at the linksys media hub (nmh410 $ 430 on amazon) , but would like something that has more upward expansion (it currently supports two sata 1 tb disks).  </s>
<s> does anyone have any other suggestions?  </s>
<s> do a shopping search for nas.  </s>
<s> network attached storage.  </s>
<s> here's what i've found...i encourage you to run a search on &quot;network attached storage reviews&quot; or network attached storage recommendations&quot;.  </s>
<s> pcmag, cnet, network world, pcworld, amazon.com  </s>
<s> all have lists of some sort.  </s>
<s> what i do is evaluate other users' reviews consistency across the board for an overall sense of the nas' which bubble to the top.  </s>
<s> in the end, it all depends on what you want to do.  </s>
<s> hp's mediasmart next model was launched recently, as was western digital.  </s>
<s> however, it seems that netgear(infrant) models are getting consistently higher reviews from a wider range of users.  </s>
<s> buffalo technology's terastation or linkstation pro are also seeming to be more consistent across a larger base of users.  </s>
<s> there are others (synology, iomega, seagate/maxtor) which may warrant closer examination.  </s>
<s> i'm hoping to narrow my choices down, but for me it's important to have remote web access, raid redundancy, ease of use for the typical user, printer sharing, etc. but i can identify with you that it is a bit daunting, particularly since this will be a new venture for me.  </s>
<s> i must say that some of the reviews tend to be more directed toward a small/medium business user or small company with an it dept.  </s>
<s> i just desire more of a pnp type assembly for the home user with lots of media growing needs.  </s>
<s> my 2 cents.  </s>
