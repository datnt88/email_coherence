<s> i'm looking for a new power supply for my pc, and i've found loads of psu's that have one fan at the back and one at the top. the problem is that i only have a hole in my case for a fan at the back.  </s>
<s> would i be able to have a fan at the top of the case with no hole?  </s>
<s> or will it just blow hot air around and be pointless to buy?  </s>
<s> any help is much appreciated.  </s>
<s> when the psu is mounted in a case, that fan that you think exhausts to the top of the case is actually a bottom intake fan.  </s>
<s> to help us confirm your problem, please post a link to that particular psu model.  </s>
<s> often temperature controlled in speed to run only as needed.  </s>
<s> agree with linit's.  </s>
<s> simply look at the pattern of the mounting holes.  </s>
<s> only one way to install the supply because of the one mounting hole that is offset.  </s>
<s> a simple form of keying.  </s>
<s> yeah, it looks like the second fan is suppossed to point downwards.  </s>
<s> thanks a lot for the help.  </s>
