<s> i currently have a dell inspiron e1505 with a 120gb 5400rpm hard drive and want to go up to something bigger.  </s>
<s> my choices are a 250gb 5400 hd and a 200gb 7200 rpm hard drive for about $35 more.  </s>
<s> is the speed of the 7200 fast enough to really make a big difference to my system to compensate for less space?  </s>
<s> xp for instance is limited to 127gb.  </s>
<s> note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.  </s>
<s> my system is dell inspiron e1505, 2gb ram, 256 ati radeon hypermemory, windows vista home premium, 120gb 5400rpm hd, intel core 2 duo 1.6ghz  </s>
<s> unless your laptop is rarely on the go, you might want to stick with the 5400rpm 250gb drive.  </s>
<s> it appears you are attempting to configure a laptop for gaming so battery time is a non-issue.  </s>
