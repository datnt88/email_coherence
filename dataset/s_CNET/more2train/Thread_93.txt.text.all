<s> i have comcast cable with a motorola surfboard modem model sb5120 installed 6/25/2005 so it's 5 years old now.  </s>
<s> it goes to an alphashield then to a neatgear wgt624v2 router.  </s>
<s> a couple times a day it will disconnect. the internet will slow down and then some of the lights will go out.  </s>
<s> only lasts a minute or two then it will be ok and the lights will be steady.  </s>
<s> does that sound like the modem going out or a comcast problem? is 5 years pretty old? or could it be my alphashield or router?  </s>
<s> maybe a little complain might help.  </s>
<s> if i were comcast i would definitely try to make you happy.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> doing this. the modem is 5 years old, not the problem.  </s>
<s> i bought the modem so i'm not renting it from comcast.  </s>
<s> so before i called comcast i wanted to ask if it could be the modem going out which i would have to replace myself.  </s>
<s> of course there's possibility that it could be bad. the nice thing about a router-modem can be had for about $50.  </s>
