i have redone an older dell desktop for my dad and changed to a widescreen monitor but cannot get aspect ratio correct. 
output to monitor is for standard size monitor so that makes everything short and fat. 
how do i change to widescreen. 
i am running xp with sp3 monitor is viewsonic brand. 
any ideas??? 
1. monitor driver. 
2. video card driver. 
i don't see where you addressed either. 
some wide display instead of the 4:3 of old.
