<s> hello, i am a person who is responsible for system administration in medium size broker's company (approx.  </s>
<s> 80 employees) we have a lot of workers and visitors with wi-fi notebooks who want to surf internet it all over the campus.  </s>
<s> currently we have something like a dozen of access points (several conference rooms, trading room, lobby etc.) that were configured separately.  </s>
<s> we have separate network for those aps because i'm afraid of intruders equipped with wi-fi sniffers who can penetrate into our lan. one more thing that make life difficult is the fact we had to configure wep with the same key-phrase so users can surf via any one of our ap's.  </s>
<s> what i'd like to know - is there some kind of simple software that can help me to manage the wireless network easily, including managing access for limited time visitors.  </s>
<s> also i'd like to know who is currently connected, how many users surf via wireless etc. the program must be simple to install and use, since this is only a part of my duties and i don't want to waste my time dealing with over-sophisticated network management tools (that cost tons of money).  </s>
<s> thanks, evgenek klein, mngd  </s>
<s> to get there, you'll have to replace all the current waps for ones that work with software that does this.  </s>
<s> cisco has this feature.  </s>
<s> but my bet is that you may not be willing to pay for this.  </s>
