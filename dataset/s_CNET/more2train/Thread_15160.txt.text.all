<s> tks for your help.  </s>
<s> a router allows you to share an internet connection with all the computers on your network.  </s>
<s> it also allows the sharing of files between said computers.  </s>
<s> if you have only a single computer at each location, a router would be of little use to you.  </s>
<s> you might want to read about remote desktop.  </s>
<s> it allows you to access the other (remote) computer over the internet and use it as if you were sitting in front of it.  </s>
