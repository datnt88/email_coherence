i'm trying to find out if anyone has reviewed the various brands of cd-r's available. 
cnet had a very helpful page, with info by someone named jon jacobi, covering everything about cd-r's and reviewing brands. 
unfortunately, clicking on the links just gives you a &quot;can't find the page&quot; response. 
i'm not computer savvy and i just need someone who can direct me to the right page on cnet (why is that so hard to find? 
- rhetorical question.). 
can anyone help?

frankly i am buying just two types of cdr. the hp cdr packages and for lightscribe the verbatim. 
zero coasters and issues here.

thanks, rp. we tried the colored sonys and are having a bad time with them. 
now on maxells. 
we'll look the verbatims, if these fail us. 
(though i don't know what &quot;lightscribe&quot; is. 
but don't feel the need to educate me; that could be a frustrating exercise ). 
thanks, again. 
if over 2 years i'd try the cd lens cleaner (see google) and if it's some desktop you are looking at under 30 to get a new drive.

reduce the record speed to 2x or at least 1/2 the speed of the media or drive whichever is lower. 
example. 
52x cdrw, 32x cdr media = 16x record speed to keep it safe.

thanks, y'all.
