<s> okay, i've been out of the computer world for a while and don't consider myself knowledgeable enough anymore to make these decisions on parts.  </s>
<s> i'd like to make the best gaming desktop or laptop computer possibly using only about $1,000.  </s>
<s> while i prefer a laptop, a desktop is also acceptable.  </s>
<s> now, i'm not a hardcore gamer, i just want to get into computer gaming.  </s>
<s> maybe a little world of warcraft, some star wars, and a few other games.  </s>
<s> i'm also always downloading programs (though i am carefule) and busy making presentations and reports, so it's important to have a good processor and sufficient memory.  </s>
<s> i can't make it myself, but i'd happily buy my parts and pay to have it put together than pay the same price for a not-as-good computer which i will not like. it should include dvd and cd burners and readers, and other ports for memory cards (pro duo), and usb.  </s>
<s> as for operating system, i've heard nothing but bad reviews in regards to vista.  </s>
<s> i'm aware of linux but have never used it and would not like it to interfere with games.  </s>
<s> i feel like i've spoken to much.  </s>
<s> are there some build suggestions?  </s>
<s> any help is very much appreciated.  </s>
<s> they don't have the graphics horsepower.  </s>
<s> they'll be able to handle old games (2005 or earlier) or world of warcraft at moderate settings.  </s>
<s> see this post for a $1000 gamer that can handle new games:  </s>
<s> are there any more suggestions?  </s>
<s> i'm still not completely sure about switching to vista, and if so, 32-bit or 64-bit?  </s>
