<s> anyway i am having a problem with the computer power switch.  </s>
<s> i have an emachines w3080 and it's about two years old.  </s>
<s> lately the power switch seems to be getting stuck in the case a lot.  </s>
<s> when you push it to turn it on, it's not coming back out it stays there for some reason.  </s>
<s> not all the time but a lot.  </s>
<s> i was wondering if anyone else had this kind of problem and what they did to correct this issue?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> michelle  </s>
<s> you should check the &quot;fit&quot; of the power sw. to the case.  </s>
<s> not always but sometimes, a physical obstruction due the case skin or path is causing the sw. to be stuck.  </s>
<s> you can better fit the case(relocate) for the best operation, plus clean and lube(use spray wax) to lessen stickness.  </s>
<s> however, some sw. do surcome to wear&tear and replacement is recommended, of course you then need emachine support for that.  </s>
<s> these sws. are simple in design and offer little in repair but replace and above advice.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> if i would get it fixed i would probably have to do that, being i don't like to mess around with hardware.  </s>
<s> i'm kind of a computer dummy when it comes to that, i would be to afraid to open the power case.  </s>
<s> thank you for giving me some advice though on what to do.  </s>
<s> do you know how much this would cost in the end?  </s>
<s> would that be expensive to do?  </s>
<s> thank you for your help.  </s>
<s> michelle  </s>
<s> mostly the 'button' is a round blob of badly molded plastic secured with two lesser blobs to some arbitrary part of the case front.  </s>
<s> i know, because the slot button on my sony dvd writer broke, and wouldn't eject (it did on command in 'my computer') i had to stick cardboard behind to force it forwards.  </s>
<s> works fine, but shouldn't be necessary.  </s>
<s> this isn't that time consuming if that's what it is.  </s>
<s> you should expect at least 30-min billing or an 1hr.  </s>
<s> if that's the minium amount to bill or along those lines.  </s>
<s> if you have a more computer savy friend, it's a straightfoward attempt to correct if a physical thing.  </s>
<s> check emachine support website for any &quot;graphic&quot; displays or part diagrams/exploded views if available.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
