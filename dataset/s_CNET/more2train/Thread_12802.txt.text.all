<s> my old hp desk top hard drive crashed long ago (2008?). i had a tech come to the house to repair and replaced the hard drive.  </s>
<s> per my request , he had also opened up the hdd so i could see what the actual disk looked like inside.  </s>
<s> i removed the disk from its casing and stored it away (avoiding any static damage).  </s>
<s> since i no longer have its original casing and components , is it still possible to have any info/data recovered?  </s>
<s> ive heard recently that it is not possible.  </s>
<s> please let me know,,no point in still holding onto it if that is the case..thanks  </s>
<s> once you've opened the hard drive, it can't be read by ordinary means, but there are companies that will recover the data for a price.  </s>
<s> i've never had need for that because i always back my data up, but i've read that these services cost in the $1000 to $2000 range.  </s>
<s> for most folks it's not worth it.  </s>
<s> since it's been 5 years for you, i'd be surprised if it were worth it to you.  </s>
<s> but if it is, go for it!  </s>
<s> you've removed any possible chance that an user could recover any data, excluding some weird geek type. the only practical option is to have some &quot;data recovery service&quot; where you send away the discs to try to do this.  </s>
<s> of course those services costs tend to be expensive, so you decide if the data is worth it.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i just may throw it out in the trash after-all.  </s>
<s> thats too bad..:(  </s>
