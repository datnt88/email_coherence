<s> i have three printers and not a one works properly.  </s>
<s> one is an hp photosmart c4480 (all-in-one) which prints for my mac os x, 10.6.3.  </s>
<s> it was working ok for a while and now it only prints blacke.  </s>
<s> even pictures come out black.  </s>
<s> i have bought new cartridges and downloaded the latest software.  </s>
<s> the next pc. is a dell dimension 2400 using winxp i pretty much rebuilt after hurricane charlie got through with it.  </s>
<s> anyway, i have a kodak, easyshare (all in-one) printer with that and it won't do anything with black.  </s>
<s> it will print in colour but looks very much like a negative.  </s>
<s> new cartridges installed and the latest software downloaded.  </s>
<s> i bought a used printer to help me get by while i tried to solve my problems.  </s>
<s> it's an h.p deskjet 5650.  </s>
<s> i invested in two new cartridges and plugged it into my ibm laptop thinkpad.  </s>
<s> strange thing is, it will print a beautiful hp in blue at thebottom of the page and hp deskjet 5600 , at the top.  </s>
<s> i should mention that a while ago i had them all wirelessed and could print on one printer from all three.  </s>
<s> trouble stared when we bought the mac which i hate!  </s>
<s> i'm quite good with windows although both of my othe pc's are running winxp&gt; apart from being frustrating, it's getting expensive and my computer illiterate husband is sure that i am the problem.  </s>
<s> if have always thought that most of you moderators are geniuses and hope someone can advise me.  </s>
<s> thanks, hopefully, val fasig  </s>
<s> it has no color.  </s>
<s> just a few minutes to install and do the alignment.  </s>
<s> and now it prints color again.  </s>
<s> this model sure eats ink.  </s>
<s> but your issue sounds like something else.  </s>
<s> i don't see what it is unless someone has been tinkering with printer settings.  </s>
<s> sorry i think we need karnac.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> assuming that you uninstalled and re installed the software(s) and still have/had the same issues?  </s>
<s> of course the mac is going to use different software (usually a separate cd).  </s>
<s> also, what are the operating systems on the pc's?  </s>
<s> two have windows xp and one has the mac safari.  </s>
<s> i did download the the latest software for the mac version.  </s>
<s> still not having luck.  </s>
<s> i can print letters and other data on the h.p c4480 but pictures ae still printing black!  </s>
<s> thank you for your suggestions. the hpp 4480 is fixed.  </s>
<s> i, again, uninstalled and reinstalled the software and that did it.  </s>
<s> it won't, however, do it for my other two.  </s>
<s> i'll keep trying.  </s>
<s> my husband's accusing me of being obsessed.  </s>
<s> well, at least the one he uses is better!  </s>
<s> thanks again!  </s>
<s> valerie  </s>
