<s> which is better?  </s>
<s> i have spoken with dell and hp and they say the intel has a dual core with 3.2 gig and amd they say only goes up to 2.6.  </s>
<s> they also say that amd is still comparable in speed because the cache is built into the processor.  </s>
<s> i am going to have a computer built and i am not sure which processors to go with.  </s>
<s> i will be using my computer for gaming mostly.  </s>
<s> compare them.  </s>
<s> google: tomshardware.com  </s>
<s> cpu charts looks like the athlon 64 x2 4800+ has better gaming scores than the pentium d 950; however, there is a price difference.  </s>
<s> do you have a price range for the cpu?  </s>
<s> are you looking to compare particular models?  </s>
<s> they both seemed to be priced pretty close to each other.  </s>
<s> i wanted to know which can handle the most during gaming, and is the fastest.  </s>
<s> i think you are referring to total system price and not just the cpu price if you were building it yourself.  </s>
<s> of the two i mentioned earlier, the amd cpu costs about twice as much as the intel cpu.  </s>
<s> care to share any details on the systems?  </s>
<s> system model name cpu model video card model amount of ram hint: nobody can tell you which is the ''fastest'' for gaming until you tell us the specific cpu model name.  </s>
<s> amd and intel make many dual core processors.  </s>
<s> hint hint: video card model usually has more to say about how good a gaming machine it will be.  </s>
<s> if so then check out the intel core duo extreme edition while for amd look at the athlon fx. if though you do have a bit of a budget then that can be ratcheted down to just the core duo for intel and athlon 64 x2 for amd that can also be pretty good.  </s>
<s> another factor is to look at the requirements for the games you want to play on it.  </s>
<s> what kind of requirements do they have and do you want to do any overclocking on this system?  </s>
