i just got a computer case to build a computer, and i need to decide which motherboard i need.. im looking for a not so expensive but good quality that has 2 pcie x16 slots at least, and 2 or more pci slots, 4 or more usb ports, and a socket 755 cpu connector thing. 
i was thinking a nvidia nforce 600 series, but i want to know if theres anything that is better, for the same, maybe a little more. 
also, if its bundled with a cpu that would be great, but it isnt that important. 
any suggestions? 
also, its got to be atx form factor, and compatible with 800mhz memory 
650i will be less expensive.
