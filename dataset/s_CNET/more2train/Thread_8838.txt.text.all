<s> hi guys, the printer is a hp deskjet d1520 and is less than 6 months old.  </s>
<s> worked great untill i insallted a crap progame it came with called greeting card.  </s>
<s> from there the printer stopped printing so i uninstalled all the hp software and deleted all the usb root thingys in device manager restarted and still i got an error &quot;this device has malfunction and windows does not recogonise it&quot; after tyring everything and being convice its the old pc i bought a new one.  </s>
<s> this time when i connect the printer it says &quot;unknown device&quot;, &quot;the new hardware is installed and ready to use&quot;, &quot;this device has malfuncion and windows does not recogonise it&quot; so back to the old drawing board i went with deleted usb root thingys.  </s>
<s> i made sure the bios is set to recogonise all usb devices.  </s>
<s> i'm at wits end, can someone please provide me on somethings i can try?  </s>
<s> anyone?  </s>
<s> u should not delete the usb root things that ur talking about.they are the usb controllers that allow u to use usb devices... u will need to install the chipset drivers if u have ur motherboard disk then install the printer software with the printer connected to it...follow the instructions in the manual u got with the printer.... if u wish to purchase some stuff for ur computer try this link  </s>
