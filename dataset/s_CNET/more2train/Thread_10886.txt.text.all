<s> hi. i'm wondering what the difference is between cat5e cables and the cat6 variety.  </s>
<s> thanks a lot.  </s>
<s> cat5e supports signal rates up to 200 mhz, while cat6 can support signal rates more than 3 times faster.  </s>
<s> other than their internal structures, that's about the main difference.  </s>
<s> thanks. in terms of mega- and gigabits, how fast are these rates?  </s>
<s> mega = million; giga = billion, more or less.  </s>
