<s> hey guys.. i have an acer al1916fbd , and i was wondering how i would go about connecting a videogame console with component outputs to my lcd. the recommended resolution on my monitor is 1280x1024.  </s>
<s> i have heard that i should get a vga box, scan converter, transcoder... i dunno , i believe these are different names for the same type of product.  </s>
<s> can anyone help me?? thanks!!  </s>
<s> since you've got both vga and dvi inputs, it will be easy if you've got an xbox360 since you can pickup a vga output at most places that sell the 360.  </s>
<s> if you've got a classic xbox, vga adapters were made but they seem to have disappeared -- check ebay if your console has component outputs, ebay has transcoder for about $50 but i don't know how good/bad the picture quality will be.  </s>
<s> (or search for &quot;ps2 vga&quot;)  </s>
<s> yeah i was lokin at those, but i'm a lil' weary of ordering something like that on ebay.  </s>
<s> don't get me wrong , i get stuff on ebay all the time, but i want to get something name-brand i can trust.  </s>
<s> any other suggestions?  </s>
<s> where is everybody on this board?!? this topic has been on the front page fro 2 days...  </s>
<s> take a look; this might be what you need.  </s>
