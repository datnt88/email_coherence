<s> the laptop could print before i connected the cross over cable.  </s>
<s> when i connect the cable, then the laptop cant print.  </s>
<s> sorry, but crossover cables and connections to the pc with such are simply hack jobs that require whoever does that to keep notes about how they did that.  </s>
<s> i'm going to share that it all works fine in the normal way of connections from the internet to the router and then to the computers.  </s>

<s> don't do that.  </s>

<s> good luck with that setup.  </s>
