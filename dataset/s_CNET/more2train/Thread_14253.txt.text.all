<s> hi friends, building a 1u linux server is different from building a normal tower case because 1u is equal to 1.75 inches in height and i realized that it will be working within a smaller space than with other computer cases.  </s>
<s> to this end, power supplies, fans, video cards, network cards, hard drives and cd-rom drives all have been made with a lower height requirement.  </s>
<s> so, i want to learn the process to build a 1u linux server.  </s>
<s> if anyone having idea on it, then please share with me and help me for my mission.  </s>
<s> thanks and regards, rodger hooks  </s>
<s> so i'm locking this.  </s>
<s> p  </s>
<s> but such servers are readily available and all you do is install your server os. no one i know builds the hardware unless you count installing it into a rack.  </s>
