<s> hi, with the help of someone on this site as well as a few other people i have recently purchased a new desktop pc. i have not purchased a monitor yet and i don't really know much about them.  </s>
<s> i have narrowed down the monitors i want to 2 choices.  </s>
<s> this is the first monitor.  </s>
<s> this is the second monitor.  </s>
<s> they are nearly an identical price so i am not worried about that part.  </s>
<s> i just need to know which one is better.  </s>
<s> also if someone knows of a better monitor to get for around $200cad or less please let me know.  </s>
<s> (keep in mind i am from canada) if you are interested, here is the computer the monitor will be hooked up to.  </s>
<s> thank you in advance for anyone that can help me with this.  </s>
<s> to the first and second monitor don't work.  </s>
<s> they go back to your post.  </s>
<s> please try again with a better link (no quotes in it) and - before posting - try on the preview page if they really work.  </s>
<s> also tell what you want to use the monitor for.  </s>
<s> for example: gaming, viewing hd video, office work, graphic design etc. kees  </s>
<s> this way, no links to fail.  </s>
<s> there may be reviews on these but as it stands i think the best review is in a store where i can look at the displays.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
