<s> i want to see a wireless terminal that allows you to remote into your home computer and looks/acts like a big iphone.  </s>
<s> hardware would include a 13 inch touchscreen, an 'n' network card, a small video card, and a battery. the whole thing would remote into your home computer (or someone elses) and you could bring up a transparent keyboard on the screen with a screen gesture (terminology?). battery life would be stellar!  </s>
<s> and realistically this shouldn't cost more than $250  </s>
<s> another description would be a wirless, dumb terminal, without a keyboard.  </s>
<s> and hopefully the possiblility to port usb devices through rdp (i don't have any knowledge in that area)  </s>
<s> &quot;thin client tablets&quot; and &quot;smart displays&quot; without keyboard/mouse never caught on and were replaced by laptops with tablet funtionality.  </s>
<s> the market wasn't there.  </s>
<s> here's one -&gt; there are many more.  </s>
<s> they were burned before, why should we do this again?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thanks guys, of course, neither of those look very impressive, one advantage should be weight, and 3 pounds doesn't really cut it.  </s>
<s> i think they could gain a big foothold if they were done 'right': 1. have it look like this 2. include two modes: a remote desktop+usb for high bandwidth availability and a browser only functionality for low bandwidth 3. make it a little rugged and water proof.  </s>
<s> without a keyboard, it would be easy.  </s>
<s> then you could use it at home, away, or in the shower thanks again!  </s>
<s> 3lbs is about the lightest it will get with an lcd touch panel.  </s>
<s> awesome!!! now i wonder how fast remote desktop'ing' would be over http at home thanks everyone!  </s>
<s> netbooks are smaller laptops/notebook with xp just remote in to your base machine.  </s>
