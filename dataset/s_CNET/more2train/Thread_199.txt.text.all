sorry to do this again, but i updated a few things and want a second ok before i buy. 
i would like this to run wow on ultra and have dual monitors, be quiet and not over heat. 
these are the pieces i've gotten so far from newegg.com motherboard - gigabyte ga-990fxa-ud3 am3+ amd 990fx sata 6gb/s usb 3.0 atx amd motherboard video card - sapphire 100311-3l radeon hd 6970 2gb 256-bit gddr5 pci express 2.0 x16 crossfirex support video card ram - patriot intel extreme master, limited edition 8gb (2 x 4gb) 240-pin ddr3 sdram ddr3 1866 (pc3 15000) desktop memory model pvi38g186c9k cpu - amd fx-6350 vishera 3.9ghz socket am3+ 125w six-core desktop processor fd6350frhkbox cd drive - asus black sata dvd-rom drive model dvd-e818aat - oem hard drive - refurbished: wd wd blue wd2500aakx 250gb 7200 rpm 16mb cache sata 6.0gb/s 3.5&quot; internal hard drive power supply - corsair builder series cx600 600w atx12v v2.3 80 plus bronze certified active pfc power supply case - cougar challenger black steel atx computer case with 12cm cougar turbine hyper-spin bearing silent fans and 20cm led fan i've heard that i should up my power supply and that my build will probably run loud and hot, should i change some things? 
any help/recommendations would be awesome!!!!!! 
go back to the corsair list and pick one that's 750w or bigger. 
with a 125w cpu and a 250w gpu your going to be producing some serious heat. 
it should not take very long to figure out if the case cooling system is adequate. 
sometimes an easy fix is to just take the side cover off. 
did you notice how your getting closer to that 1000 buck mark i mentioned? 
yeah i noticed that. 
lol i would like to try and keep it under that, if anything.
