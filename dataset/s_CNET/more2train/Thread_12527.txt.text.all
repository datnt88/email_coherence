<s> i'm looking into buying a portable external hard drive.  </s>
<s> i need something lightweight (&lt;1lb) but would also like the maximum capacity.  </s>
<s> i've narrowed it down to 2 options.  </s>
<s> 1.western digital passport- 120gb usb 2.0 - 2.5&quot; external hard drive or 2.seagate portable st9100801u2 external 100gb hard drive the western digital only has 2mb cache. the seagate offers 8mb cache and 2 usb connections &quot;for improved performance&quot; but the hard drive is 20gb smaller.  </s>
<s> recommendations???  </s>
<s> one usb connection will likely fail to deliver enough power on most laptops.  </s>
<s> i own the 60gb model and have nothing to write about it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> throughput is limited by usb 2.0.  </s>
<s> you can also 'build your own' so to speak....pick out an external case of choice and a 2.5&quot; drive of choice and you're done.  </s>
<s> on the plus side you've got a much longer warranty if that matters to you...most 'off the shelf' externals are limited to 1 year enclosure and drive.  </s>
<s> most stand alone enclosures have 1 year warranties and stand alone drive warranties vary from 1 to 5 years.  </s>
<s> now some mfgs are now offering 7,200rpm laptop hdds...again your choice  </s>
<s> i've heard that some laptops don't have enough power.  </s>
<s> are there any tips for dealing with this?  </s>
<s> it has this cable -&gt; but this is only needed where its needed.  </s>
<s> for me, it's supplied with that drive so that's what i use all the time.  </s>
