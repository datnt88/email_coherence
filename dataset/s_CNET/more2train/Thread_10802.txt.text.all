i just got a new comp and i need to know how to convert my old harddrive to fit just wondering if its possilbe and what would be the easiest way to do it 
it is possible that your new computer does not have any ide interfaces. 
what is make, model and os you are running? 
if all else fails, you could mount the old drive in an external box, either usb or firewire, and go from there. 
however reports are easy to find where someone tried to move their booting xp hard disk to a new machine. 
here's some links on how to recover your os. again, if there are files you can't lose, then you would have them on some other media because this area is all about risk. 
read a few of these if you are moving and hoping to save an os install step.
