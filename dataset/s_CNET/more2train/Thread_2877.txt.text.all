<s> even after putting on the standoffs in the case, the video card does not seat perfectly but it does work.  </s>
<s> would the video card get damaged if it is not seated perfectly?  </s>
<s> one time i found fried fingers on the pcb card edge.  </s>
<s> you really need to fix it.  </s>
<s> there is like about 1/16 of an inch left before it is fully seated.  </s>
<s> is the motherboard too low in the case?  </s>
<s> if so some fiber washers on top of the mounting studs can help.  </s>
<s> where do you buy fiber washers?  </s>
<s> and what kind?  </s>
<s> over the years i have some in my kit from prior machines.  </s>
<s> i used this as an example of how to use what common part i see in most cases or motherboard mounting kits.  </s>
<s> any shop that sells pc parts (not best bu, gold max or such will have such) should have them.  </s>
<s> after discharging any static electricity (see note below) and unplugging the pc get a straightedge and see if somethings bent.  </s>
<s> you my need to replace the motherboard or video card.  </s>
<s> listen for arching electricity.  </s>
<s> a sure sign the gap is too wide.  </s>
<s> look for a black sooty residue on the agp/pci/pcie slot, this means it's been arching.  </s>
<s> arching is bad news.  </s>
<s> what temperatures is this card running at?  </s>
<s> over 70c and you have a problem.  </s>
<s> approaching 70c might be a problem for some boards, over 66c or more.  </s>
<s> check with the manufacturer of the card for the upper temperature limits for this card.  </s>
<s> high operating temperatures might be a sign of poor connectivity between the card and the board.  </s>
<s> the note &gt;&gt;&gt; removing static discharge: care should be exercised whenever dealing with electricity.  </s>
<s> you have not given us your age.  </s>
<s> if under 18 years old your parents must assist you.  </s>
