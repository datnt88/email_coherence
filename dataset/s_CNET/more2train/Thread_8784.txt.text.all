<s> hi, i'm getting a new computer and was wondering if there was a easy way to transfer all the programs and files from my old computer to my new one.  </s>
<s> thanks for any help.  </s>
<s> happy holidays,  </s>
<s> you'll need to install any programs or applications.  </s>
<s> data files can be transferred several different ways depending on the total disk space they occupy now.  </s>
<s> cds, dvds, flash/jump/thumb/pen drives, external hdds, etc., believe this has been well covered numerous time here on cnet ...let us know if you can't find it.  </s>

<s> what os, or even if these are macs, all i can think of is the &quot;files and settings transfer wizard&quot;.  </s>
