<s> i used a cd disc cleaner,the ones with the little brush on the underside,and now it will not read any cd's whatsoever,but it will still play dvd's?please  </s>
<s> help  </s>
<s> seen such... we swap the drive out and move that unit to the pile of the dead.  </s>
<s> i'm seeing dvd all format recorders fall to under 50 bucks so it's not that big a repair bill.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> the use of cd drive cleaners are not encouraged.  </s>
<s> during the cleaning process, that one small plastic or cloth strip (that breaks in multiple strips after use) pushes the lens reader of the cd drive.  </s>
<s> in such process, there are times that the strip mis-aligns the lens alignment, hence, you will get a disc reading problem.  </s>
<s> lens alignment is expensive and it could only be done by using a lens alignment/lens distance measuring device. the lens does not get so much dirt (unless you are working in a fabric company that some fabrics go into the lens) since it does not touch anything during the reading process.  </s>
<s> only the ir led does the reading.  </s>
