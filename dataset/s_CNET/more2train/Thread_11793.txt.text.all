<s> i have an external hard drive by ads technologies.  </s>
<s> it's model number usbx-835 and i cannot find a power adapter for it anywhere.  </s>
<s> the pin configuration seems so strange, i don't know if it's a 5 or 6 pin set up! can anyone help me?  </s>
<s> thank you!  </s>
<s> it's faster and cheaper to change to another enclosure.  </s>
<s> the cords are out there all over ebay for 10 or 15 bucks...that would be easiest, but i can't seem to find the right one. the hard drive is attached to the enclosure and i don't really know how to just change out the enclosure.  </s>
<s> i wish i could just plug it into the usb and make it work, but it needs external power obviously.  </s>
<s> you claim the cords are there but you did not find the right one.  </s>
<s> again, change the drive to a new enclosure and you'll fix this in much less time that anyone expected.  </s>
<s> here's a tutorial -&gt;  </s>
<s> you need two voltages that are present in any 3 1/2&quot; enclosure ps brick.  </s>
<s> you use your dvm or, if lucky, wiring color codes to figure out what goes to where.  </s>
<s> you get soldering and splicing equipment...maybe a grommet or two.  </s>
<s> i can't give exact step by step but this can be done.  </s>
<s> you're result may be ugly and it won't be ul approved.  </s>
<s> make sure you're home insurance is up to date.  </s>
<s> or, use bob's advice.  </s>
