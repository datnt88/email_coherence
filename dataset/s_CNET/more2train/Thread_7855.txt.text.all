<s> hi, my girlfriend and i are both experiencing the same problem.  </s>
<s> we will be in the middle of doing something and the computer will just turn off.  </s>
<s> not even like it's going to reboot....turns off completely.  </s>
<s> both on laptops....her's is a compaq and mine is an ibm thinkpad both running xp pro.  </s>
<s> what could be causing this....very annoyed  </s>
<s> similar problem with my ibm t60 laptop running windows xp. (sp3) i can use the m/c for a long time if i am just accessing the internet and doing email.  </s>
<s> problem usually occurs pretty quickly when i use an application like access or powerpoint.  </s>
<s> i have removed the battery and left just the plug in.  </s>
<s> same issue with battery removed.  </s>
<s> i have re-installed the operating system, same issue after new o/s installed.  </s>
<s> i have replaced the hard disk.  </s>
<s> i would like some opinion as to what would be the next (easiest, cheapest) step.  </s>
<s> replace ?? 1. memory; 2 power supply; 3 mother board; 4.display; 5 laptop;...(yeah i know..the last one...) any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> generally speaking...laptops don't 'breathe' or expel heat as well a desktops so making sure vents are not blocked during use is critical.  </s>
<s> using a laptop on your lap, on a pillow or sitting on a bed often blocks the vents that help laptops breathe.  </s>
<s> laptop coolers ....flat surfaces with fan can also help.  </s>
<s> another thing....dust often builds up inside laptops and dramatically reduces their ability to stay cool....a little compressed air can help eliminate some of that.  </s>
<s> having enough system ram and free hard disk space also helps.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> that is, clean it out and replace the cpu heat sink compound?  </s>
<s> it's an older machine so why not do the usual maintenance?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> how do i get info on changing the heat sink compound...ie: opening up the laptop...looks like a lot of tiny screws on the bottom....do they all just come out and the bottom pops off?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> so disk should be fine..i use the laptop on a flat desk in a generally cooler room.... i'lll check the venting...thanks  </s>
<s> compartment for dust bunnies.  </s>
<s> might also try installing pcwizard ....download it, run it and minimize it....it will show a series of system temps in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  </s>
<s> it could help tell you whether it's a computer component temp problem or not.  </s>
<s> keep us posted how it works out.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> while it may not be this exact laptop, after you have worked on a few they begin to look the same.  </s>
<s> from your reply this laptop is not being maintained.  </s>
<s> that is, it was not getting a blast of canned air on the vents every 6 months or even yearly.  </s>
<s> cnet has a video about cleaning and it looks like a thinkpad in the video.  </s>
<s> here's the link -&gt; try that and if that doesn't help, move to the heat sink replacement.  </s>
<s> it's only a few dollars for the compound and i can't look for the specific model thinkpad (no model number in the posts i could find) so here's one of many -&gt; bob  </s>
<s> aside from the wonderful hints above, (as overheating would cause the laptop to do this) i would try to verify that the laptops are good and clean with anti-virus and anti-rootkit software.  </s>
<s> if it was just one laptop, sure i could see the above being true more so, but for both laptops (not out of the question) shutting down?  </s>
<s> i am sure you must share files?  </s>
<s> music perhaps?  </s>
<s> i just start with easy then dig inside. the difference in hardware also supports my decision.  </s>
