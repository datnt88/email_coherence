<s> ok. i've just installed a new stick of 256mb ddr ram.  </s>
<s> i already had 256mb already installed that was fine.  </s>
<s> when i turned on the comp after putting the new stick in i went to start &gt; control pannel &gt; system and saw that the new stick of ram was not recongized. it still only said 256mb of ram. the system i'm running is: amd 2400+ athlon xp 256mb ram asus k7s8x mother board etc can anyone help me on how to get it to work?  </s>
<s> wrong type of ram.  </s>
<s> roger  </s>
<s> it's not the wrong type of ram as the motherboard is made for ddr and the type i put in is ddr.  </s>
<s> so what is the problem then?  </s>
<s> a common misconception is if it plugs in, it should work.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> could mean lots of different types of ram and not all ddrs are intercompatible.  </s>
<s> you need to know the speed not ddr! roger  </s>
<s> how can i tell the speed of the ram?  </s>
<s> and why would it be incompataible?  </s>
<s> ram sticks have speeds and if wrong speed then wont work.  </s>
<s> dats y u go to crucial.com, kingston.com,  </s>
<s> or other ram manufacturers website and use their configurators to determine the exact spec of ur ram.  </s>
<s> [what speed ddr] pc 2100, 2700, 3400 [ddr 200, 266, 333, 400]???? what speed is the old stick??? the system will only run at the speed of the slower of the two sticks, and only if you have the memory bus speed set properly.  </s>
