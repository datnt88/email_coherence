<s> i have used xp pro for years on my toshiba satellite 2800-600 notebook.  </s>
<s> i have never had any problem too difficult for norton system works to resolve --- until about three weeks ago.  </s>
<s> i installed visio 2000 but it would not read a file created on visio 2003, so i tried to install the visio viewer.  </s>
<s> i got myself tied up in knots but eventually i could read the file.  </s>
<s> just after that, i tried to back up my laptop to an external hard drive, which i have successfully done for years.  </s>
<s> after pushing the backup button, the hourglass cursor appeared for about five seconds and then nothing more.  </s>
<s> backup would not load so i was not surprised to find that it did not show up in task manager or the task bar.  </s>
<s> everything else seemed to work fine.  </s>
<s> however, at day's end when i tried to shut down my computer, a dialog box appeared advising that backup was not responding.  </s>
<s> i had to repeatedly hit 'end now' to shut down.  </s>
<s> i also find that playing music from my hard drive now launches real player instead of windows media player.  </s>
<s> i have made the latter my default player but music will only play on real player.  </s>
<s> if i first open windows media player and choose a song, the visuals all work but there is no sound.  </s>
<s> i removed visio 2000 and visio viewer 2003 and then restored my os to a date weeks earlier than the original visio problems.  </s>
<s> these actions have not improved my situation.  </s>
<s> media player still will not produce sound, and i cannot backup.  </s>
<s> everything else seems to be 100%.  </s>
<s> can anyone offer advice, please?  </s>

<s> look up the microsoft installer cleanup utility on google.  </s>
<s> that's the only item that comes to mind given your story.  </s>
<s> as to the backup button, my only comment is that hard disk based backups do tend to fail at the worse times.  </s>

<s> i found out the hard way that restoring will not installl the sound drivers.  </s>
<s> you have to do that separately.  </s>
<s> i've done that but still don't have all my sound problems worked out.  </s>
<s> good luck to you  </s>
<s> thanks for the info, bob.  </s>
<s> i've read microsoft's cautions about that utility and it makes me nervous.  </s>
<s> by the way, my sound came back after i bought and installed registry mechanic.  </s>
<s> it found hundreds of errors which have now all been repaired.  </s>
<s> i still can't get backup to launch but at least i've got a clean registry and have sound.  </s>
<s> it makes me nervous also.  </s>
<s> i'll look into the registry mechanic to see if it can help.  </s>
<s> thanks for the suggestions!  </s>

<s> all i can share is the tool is one i've used countless times with no ill effect.  </s>
