<s> guys, i want to try to build my own desktop.  </s>
<s> i am sick of ungrading my old computer.  </s>
<s> i am ready for the challenge of building my own, and save some money in the process.  </s>
<s> i want to be able to play world of warcraft, do wordprocessing, and internet.  </s>
<s> any suggestions on what i should do.  </s>
<s> want to spend no more than $750.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> it seems like it is a popular website used by many.  </s>
<s> they got reviews and everything there.  </s>
<s> here, this $500 machine they built will run you world of warcraft and word processing.  </s>
<s> you can spend the left over money on monitor, ram, or whatever you want  </s>
<s> do you need a complete system (complete computer box, keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor)?  </s>
<s> or do you already have a good monitor or speakers that you wish to add to a computer box that you will build?  </s>
<s> btw, congratulations on taking on this challenge.  </s>
<s> i find it is quite rewarding to build a new machine.  </s>
<s> i trust you will, also.  </s>
<s> i'm also in the planning stages of building a new computer.  </s>
<s> i have chosen all of my hardware which includes an amd x2 processor, asus motherboard, western digital sata hard drive, sony dvd-rw etc.. my main concert at the moment is making sure i buy all of the cables i require. the harddrives and optical drives that i have priced up are oem so i wont recieve the cables like i would in a retail box.  </s>
<s> also not sure about the motherboard having cables packaged with it.  </s>
<s> does anyone have or know the where about of a checklist of some description that i can use to make sure i have everything i need before i start.  </s>
<s> i'd hate to of started to find i was missing simple things.  </s>
<s> a retail motherboard should come with all the cables you need for hard drives, optical drives, floppy drive, etc. in fact they often come with more than you need.  </s>
<s> look carefully at the description of the motherboard.  </s>
<s> it should say which cables are included.  </s>
