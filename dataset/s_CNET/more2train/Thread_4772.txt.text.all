hello guys, i'm going to get socket 939 mb for free, with 1.8 ghz cpu. 
now, i will oc the cpu, but i have two 8800 gts to put there, so will cpu bottleneck gpus???? thanks. 
if a game was cpu &quot;heavy&quot;, why yes! if not, then no. bob 
, thank you, i will look to buy x2 cpu. 
spend $100 and get a mobo that has a tri-core or quad-core cpu. 
939 is obsolete so you'll be stuck with a dead-end platform that went end-of-life 5 years ago.
