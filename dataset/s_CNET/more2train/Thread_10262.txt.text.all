<s> my system has 1 ide port which is taken up by the boot hard drive and the dvd drive.  </s>
<s> i have a second hard drive which is also ide but is connected to the 1st sata port using a sata-&gt;ide converter.  </s>
<s> so far, i have had no problems using this system, however recently, my much larger usb external hard drive failed.  </s>
<s> in looking for a replacement, i was wondering if there would be any problems if i were to use an internal sata drive for storage as well as the other two drives.  </s>
<s> i can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work, but i thought i'd just check before spending the cash!  </s>
<s> cheers  </s>
<s> did the external harddrive itself is bad or is it the case is bad? is this an ide or sata?  </s>
<s> personally i probably would do it this way; harddrives are so inexpensive now, i would just go and buy another one (lot less problem).  </s>
<s> i've had a 400 gig sata drive connected to a sata and power connector using 6&quot; cables. the drive sat outside my pc. soooo, it was internal drive on the outside.  </s>
<s> no usb needed.  </s>
<s> sata is easy.  </s>
