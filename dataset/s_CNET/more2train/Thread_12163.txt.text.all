<s> going on to a dfi lanparty ut nf3 250gb motherboard - and i have a choice of two athlon 64 3400+ cpus: ada3400aep4ax lbazc 0510apmw or ada3400aep4ar caa2c 0531epmw from the best info i was able to find - i think the ar is a clawhammer (it is also the newer chip), and the ax is a newcastle.  </s>
<s> (but i don't know this for sure) i am not a big ocer, but if i want to, i would like to have that ability, that is why i choose this particular m-board, and the lead question for picking one of these two cpus.  </s>
<s> i will be running xp-pro (sp2) tyia for any and all assistance - dam j  </s>
<s> prices to drop soon 15 may or so if i recall correctly.  </s>
<s> supsect dual cores will also drop when the am2 hit retailers too.  </s>
<s> for the info...the amd site should give you the info you need.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> thanks for the time vapcmd, but i have the cpus in my possesion and i need to choose between them (can't keep both).  </s>
<s> besides this is a socket 754 board, so ''dual core'' chips will not be of help to me.  </s>
<s> do you (or anyone else) know of a reason one of these cpus should be favored over the other?  </s>
<s> thanks again for your attention - dam j  </s>
<s> same cache (512kb), same operating freq (2.2ghz). the ar is the newer rev.  </s>
<s> if you could find a 3400+ with ada3400aep5ar or ada3400aep5ap opns they would be better for oc'ing since they have 1mb cache and a 2.0ghz op freq (more headroom).  </s>
<s> thanks ''ramarc'' for taking the time to post, and the terrific info site for amd cpus... i've looked for something like this for quite some time.  </s>
<s> i already have these two #4 chips, but if i had a 1gb cache chip, that's the one i'd be using alright.  </s>
<s> you're correct - the ar chip is about 5 months newer, but it also opperates at 2200mhz x11, while the ''newcastle'' is 2400mhz x12 - so like you pointed out in your post - ''headroom'' looks like the deciding factor.  </s>
<s> sure wish i knew more about reading the ''stepping'' codes.  </s>
<s> thank you again for your help - dam j  </s>
