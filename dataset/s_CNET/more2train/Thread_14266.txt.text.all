<s> i had this problem just minutes before i posted this.  </s>
<s> i've just plugged in my thumb drive to my computer, to save some document into it.  </s>
<s> this thumb drive contains all the work i've done for my 4 weeks of tertiary education (today is the 4th week of school in fact) when i attempt to open the thumb drive, instead of the folder that contains all of my data for school work, i see weird files i've never seen before.  </s>
<s> and the file type: file.  </s>
<s> am still shocked by the matter.  </s>
<s> i've just plugged in the thumb drive in another computer moments ago.  </s>
<s> no virus whatsoever detected in that computer.  </s>
<s> and now, the other computer where i found the problem give me plenty of, i would say, crap. is there a way to fix this thumb drive problem?  </s>
<s> the thumb drive data may have been corrupted.  </s>
<s> the modified dates of all the &quot;file&quot; type files are around 2079/2080!  </s>
<s> and further more, i've found that the file system is fat32, not the usual ntfs!  </s>
<s> any solutions?  </s>
<s> i usually edit a copy on the hard disk and copy to the drive.  </s>
<s> i'm sure that many might edit such on said drive but that seems to push one's luck as these devices have limited lifespans which i can easily multiply by using it my way.  </s>
<s> so the solution is simple.  </s>
<s> format the thumb drive and copy your files back on to it.  </s>

<s> it's only a week old. the latest ones contain reports that i've already handed up this week.  </s>
<s> though it's not really a problem, it's quite a bother having to download notes from an e-learning website my school had provided.  </s>
<s> sounds to me you should exchange it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> it's one of my old thumb drives which are 3 years old or older.  </s>
<s> but i guess, once the data's gone, it's gone.  </s>
<s> no enzrypting whatsoever can undo it.  </s>
<s> all such devices will eventually fail. the flash chip inside has a limited number of erase cycles and once used up you see odd things happen.  </s>
<s> you ask if it's fixable but let me assure you that while repair is possible (change the flash chip) the cost is quite high compared to a new stick.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> consider yourself lucky that you have anything.  </s>
<s> i found some of the cheap flash drives not worth keeping after 1yr.(they die much sooner) they simply crap out.  </s>
<s> however, name brands do well and if you get a high quality one, then at least it should serve you until you're done with it.  </s>
<s> be aware that &quot;static/esd&quot; is very much part of the shorten life cycle of a flash drive, ground yourself or your flash drive becomes the flash point(no pun intended) to discharge static.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
