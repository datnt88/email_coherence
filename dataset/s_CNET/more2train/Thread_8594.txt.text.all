<s> i've enjoyed a wireless network for some time.  </s>
<s> after hurricane charlie, things got messed up and i'm in the process of networking a different computer to my host (winxp). the guest computer operating system is win mn. i access the internet through cable modem and use a linksys wireless router.  </s>
<s> i've played with this for days.  </s>
<s> i've unplugged everything, redone it and checked all of the addresses etc., over and over.  </s>
<s> i used to get 100% signal between the pcs and now the best i can get is 67%. the guest computer won't even log on to the internet.  </s>
<s> i'm sure i'm overlooking some simple thing but my mind is now fried!  </s>
<s> can you suggest what i might have missed?  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>

<s> i can't tell what parts you've replaced.  </s>
<s> some spend months playing with such and in the end a new wifi card or router fixes it.  </s>

<s> hi bob, i replaced the guest (win mn.) computer only.  </s>
<s> i should tell you that a few days ago, i had the system working fine on these same two same computers with a 100% signal.  </s>
<s> i then decided to reformat the hard drive on the guest computer.  </s>
<s> i did that and then replaced the software etc. it tells me that i'm getting a 67% signal but won't log on to the internet.  </s>

<s> that's a little clearer.  </s>
<s> here's what i see happen daily.  </s>
<s> people format a drive and install &quot;windows&quot;.  </s>
<s> what they didn't know is that drivers for the motherboard, usb and other items are not installed for them or don't exist on the microsoft cd. it's become a bad problem in that years ago we were expected to know this.  </s>
<s> today, newer owners are handed working machines and not instructed on how to install an os. bob  </s>
<s> this is a compaq though and i used the recover disk to put it back to it's original factory condition.  </s>
<s> does you opinion still apply and if so, what do i do?  </s>
<s> valerie  </s>
<s> there are more items at play here.  </s>
<s> there can be updates after the cd was made.  </s>
<s> i will not know what the machine needs and owners often forget.  </s>
<s> when faced with these setups, we always bring spare routers and wifi client parts.  </s>
