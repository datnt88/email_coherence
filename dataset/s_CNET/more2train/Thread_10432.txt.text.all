if i have a 1.83 core duo how much ram would i need to get the most out of my prosser? 
what are you doing with the machine and which operating system will it use are just a couple of the factors in this as it could be anywhere from 512 mb to 4 gb for most situations though there may be some exceptions if you want to try to run something really fancy schmancy. 
it's sufficient for everything unless you do big photoshop files. 
dual core is a 32/64. 
either you will get more from a 32 bit environment or more stability from a 64 bit environment. 
ram depends on the number of processes (programs and calls) running at the same time. 
this depends on os choice (windows takes up more, sun os takes up a lot of ram but delivers the goods, linux has user defined processes, except sys and root, bsd uses less process, and plan9 uses the least. 
mac is a bsd type system) the kernel for each automatically loads the necessary drivers. 
are you running an audio video setup? 
with heavy equipment? 
a stereo? 
multiple or 3+ tier cd burner/ dvd burner racks? 
then you need more ram. 
ram which is purchased because some says it is good and not for system performance is the same as buying snow chains while living in florida. 
it makes no sense. 
go back, make a list of what you are running and the amount of ram necessay for each process. 
add that up and add 128m for safety/overflow measures. 
that should be your answer.
