i recently had troubles with my hd. i was able to retrieve the important files with pc inspector file recovery program. 
i then removed the partitions to delete all files on the hd. what should i do now so i can use the drive? 
does it need to be formated first and then partitioned? 
i'd use the drive makers fitness test to see if the drive failed.

i used the powermax software and it said it has failed. 
i am sending it back to maxtor. 
thanks for your help.
