<s> i am new to computers so i need some help.  </s>
<s> does anyone know when i do a powerpoint presentation of only 4 slides do i copy it to cd or dvd.  </s>
<s> i have never used these two functions.  </s>
<s> so if someone can explian what i use these things for it would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> with just 4 slides you should fit it on there easy.  </s>
<s> otherwise use a cdrom and just cut and paste.  </s>
<s> but you have to close it out or burn it (rendering the cd unusable for any other writing).  </s>
<s> then when you do your presentation, just double click on the cd (assuming powerpoint is loading on that computer).  </s>
<s> so that whatever you do can be removed later and you can reuse your cd for other purpose, later..  </s>
<s> i don't know what a memory stick is but i managed to burn it on cd thanks for your help  </s>
<s> two links: kees  </s>
<s> also, i don't know about the new office, but with the old one office 97 they had a program where you could just play the slideshow on a computer that didn't have it loaded on it.  </s>
<s> a pretty small program too.  </s>
