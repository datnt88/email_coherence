i've got a slave drive that was working fine and now wants new formatting. is there any way to fix the file system without formatting it so i can possibly save the data i had on it? 
i'm running windows 2000 pro with service pack 4. the drive is not the system drive for the computer. 
you posted in a hardware forum, but it looks like a software or format issue. 
here's a link to the usual software: bob 
how important is your data, you could send the drive to a data recovery service (like ontrack) to get the data back. 
when a drive all of a sudden needs formatting again there is usually something wrong with it, physically. 
what actually happened that led up to this, what told you it needed formatting, exactly what did you see?
