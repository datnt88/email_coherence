<s> hello, i would like to buy a dell ultrasharp 1905fp 19&quot; tft monitor, but unfortunately my video card is an old nvidia geforce2 mx 400 which doesn't have a dvi connector.  </s>
<s> has anyone tested these two together?  </s>
<s> how is the image and text quality like when the monitor is connected via the analog input?  </s>
<s> thanks, vasile  </s>
<s> i have the same setup as you.  </s>
<s> dell dimension 8100 series, pentium 4 1.5ghz 256mg pc800 rdram, running windows xp with same video card.  </s>
<s> i would like the same question answered and if we need to upgrade the video card before getting the 19&quot; flat panel.  </s>
<s> i am looking at the same flat panel also.  </s>
<s> let me know if you find a great price and have you seen the panel in person.  </s>
<s> i live 120 miles from the nearest dell store where i could view such a monitor.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
