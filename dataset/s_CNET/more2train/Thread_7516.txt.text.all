i just got a new core 2 quad, q9550, to replace my core 2 duo, e6600, but when i installed it there is no display on the monitor. 
i checked to see if i installed it right, which i did, but still no display. 
i have since put my old processor back, and my computer works fine. 
anyone know what might be wrong? 
most motherboards with the 945 chipset are not compatible with a q9000 series cpu. 
check your motherboard manufacturer's website to ensure compatibility. 
fixing it could be as simple as a bios update with the old cpu installed. 
let us know what you find.
