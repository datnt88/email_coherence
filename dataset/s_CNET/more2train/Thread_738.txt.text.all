<s> hi, i recently built my own computer using the following parts.  </s>
<s> processor - amd phenom ii x4 910 @ 2.6 power supply - graphics card - ati geforce 9600 gso 384mb motherboard - heatsink & fan - memory - harddrive - 7200.11 seagate barracuda 160gb 1 120mm case fan aimed at processor 2 dvd drives and a front port ok, so the computer has been working flawlessly for 7 months, with no problems.  </s>
<s> yesterday the computer shutdown when i left it on with a game running (league of legends?), and today it shutdown again with that same game running, i immediately booted into the bios to check the cpu temperature after the shutdown, and behold... 120 c!!! i immediately changed it to auto-shutdown at 70 c, and then opened the case to check whats wrong.  </s>
<s> i touched the heatsink to see if maybe it was loose, but it burnt me, which means it has good contact... i touched the power supply and it was also extremely hot... the graphics card was cool.  </s>
<s> as soon as i started it back up, everything started going back to normal, the cpu went down to 30c, with each core at about 20c, and the power supply started cooling down.  </s>
<s> now i don't know what is happening, as i've played much more demanding games without this problem (crysis?), this is the first time i've built a computer... any thoughts?  </s>
<s> because another one of these shutdowns and it would probably be time to say goodbye to the processor.  </s>
<s> any help would be appreicated, thanks!  </s>
<s> p.s. if it was the power supply not living up to the 550watts promise, would i be able to get a warranty on it?  </s>
<s> and watch the system and core temps as you use the pc. how many case fans do you have running ?  </s>
<s> re the psu.. wouldn't be on my pick list .. the 1 year warranty speak for itself.  </s>
<s> re the hs fan.... here's some info that might be worth review.  </s>
<s> let us know what you find.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> im like 1 and a half years late... but the case fan that i have pointed at the cpu was backwards, so it was working as an exhaust.  </s>
<s> anyways, 2 years and running strong, my computer is still newer than most ;d not to mention cost only around 350 back then.  </s>
<s> get a new cooler  </s>
