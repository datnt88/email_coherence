<s> my computer will not boot up i have gone in to safe mode the screen goes black and i can do nothing please can anyone help  </s>
<s> but no os was noted.  </s>
<s> any guess i will make will be a bad one and ... you may need to be in the forum that matches your os. bob  </s>
<s> it does sound like an operating system failure, let's see if i can help: if you don't have you're mother board manual, go to the company's web site (use your neighbor's computer or something)and print an online or pdf copy.  </s>
<s> using that manual as your guide, follow the steps to enter your bios settings.  </s>
<s> find the menu dedicated to computer boot up prcedures.  </s>
<s> alter the boot-order so that your cd or dvd drive boots first (the motheboard manual should explain all of the specific steps better) save the changes, but stay in the bios for a moment.  </s>
<s> open your cd/dvd drive and insert the operating system's disk (hopefully you have it).  </s>
<s> now, when you exit the bios, the system should restart and begin the boot process.  </s>
<s> a menu should now open from the cd giving you several options.  </s>
<s> those options should include repairing you're operating system, booting from the disk(i think), and a few others.  </s>
<s> select the repair option and let it work it's magic.  </s>
<s> if that doesn't work or my instructins baffle you, go to the microsoft (or whoever makes your operating system) website (using that neighbor's computer) and seek more professional assistance.  </s>
<s> good luck  </s>
