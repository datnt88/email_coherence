<s> here is my dilema, i work at a hotel, and in the lobby we have 2 television screens we use to run daily events for the conference center.  </s>
<s> when i came into work there was nothing displaying on the screens.  </s>
<s> when i checked the machine to verify that it was on i heard the fans running.  </s>
<s> so i preformed a hard reboot.  </s>
<s> the monitor displayed the screen asking me which way i wanted to re boot computer (safe mod, normally, etc.).  </s>
<s> i selected safe mode, looked through my video card program (the video card we use is an ati all-in-wonder).  </s>
<s> everything seemed fine.  </s>
<s> than i attempted to restart in normal operating mode.  </s>
<s> when i did the blue screen displayed stating it would dump physical memory.  </s>
<s> after that when i start the computer the fans will run, but nothing will display on the monitor. the action light on the front of monitor will blink once, and nothing else will follow.  </s>
<s> what will i be needing to get this running again a new computer&quot; if so will i be able to re use the video card?  </s>
<s> any trouble shooting steps would be greatly appreciated i am at a loss for anymore things to do.  </s>
<s> turn it all off and try again in a hour.  </s>
<s> if it works fine call the people who service the machine and tell them it's overheating.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> did so, nothing is happening again, and i also smelled a slight burnt smell.  </s>
<s> such devices are usually under a maintenance contract.  </s>
<s> look on the product for it.  </s>
