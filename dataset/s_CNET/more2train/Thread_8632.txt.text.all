<s> being income tax season and all, i decided when i get mine back any day now, i'm going to use some of it to build a new pc.  </s>
<s> right now i have a prehistoric via computer that runs at 700mhz and can barely do anything without bogging down.  </s>
<s> i don't want a top of the line pc that will cost over a grand and allow me to play crysis with max settings or anything, but something good enough to watch movies and play newer games at medium settings would be great.  </s>
<s> here's what i have so far: cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 5000+ = $100 mobo: biostar tf560 = $70 (after rebate) memory: a-data 4gb ddr2 800 = $80 dvd/cd drive: samsung = $30 hdd: seagate barracuda 250gb = $67 total thus far: $357 so assuming all of this is good and all, i still need a competent video card, a good monitor and maybe a new power supply?  </s>
<s> i have speakers/keyboard/mouse and operating system covered.  </s>
<s> &quot;a prehistoric via computer that runs at 700mhz&quot; would need some 100 watt psu plus almost any case will do.  </s>
<s> your new machine might be in need of a decent, well ventilated case where the 700mhz unit has been known to work in an enclosed box.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> well, i planned on buying a new case, which would come with a new psu.  </s>
<s> i should have worded by original post better, what i meant was maybe i'd need to buy a new psu to replace the one that would come with my new case?  </s>
<s> like for instance, i was looking at this one: it comes with a 450w power supply, would that be good enough?  </s>
<s> that case only has one fan, but the processor i am buying comes with a fan and heatsink, and the video card i buy will probably have one as well, would it stay cool enough in there?  </s>
<s> you added some power hungry graphics card.  </s>
<s> just checking.  </s>
<s> did you research about how 4gb shows as 2.x to 3.5gb with most versions of windows?  </s>
<s> you mentioned in your other post, buying a case with a psu, don't count on that psu.  </s>
<s> all too often its minimal output, in fact buy a better psu to handle your current needs and possible future demands.  </s>
<s> if you follow the posts here, psus are a common failure.  </s>
<s> they are the bedrock of a decent system and shouldn't be taken for granted.  </s>
<s> they often are and poof at some later date, they become an issue.  </s>
<s> you may want to reviews past posts on the topic, just use the forum search engine.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> the sonata has a 120mm fan and very good airflow.  </s>
<s> you can add a front 80mm fan if you want but it really won't be necessary for your build.  </s>
<s> here are some video card choices.  </s>
<s> geforce 8600gt, 256mb, $96 (before $20 rebate): geforce 8600gts, 256mb, $110 (before $20 rebate): geforce 9600gt, 512mb, $181: the 9600gt requires a 500w power supply, but your antec 450w will be fine.  </s>
<s> it might be a little pricy for you but i suggest you go ahead and get a new case and atleast a new psu. the most attractive option i found for the money was from apevia, they have options of colors (red, blue, and green) but i got a blue one and it looks great.  </s>
<s> psu: case: together they come out to around $200, but its money well spent, there are cheaper options if you shop around you might be able to cut it down to around $150  </s>
