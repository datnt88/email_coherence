new sapphire radeon hd 5830 in computer but wont boot -850 power supply -help 
if you fitted the card yourself, open up the case &amp; check that everything is properly seated, properly connected, etc. as you may have dislodged something. 
remove &amp; reseat the ram modules. 
if you didn't take anti-static precautions when handling the card or touching the other motherboard components, you may have damaged something by conducting static electricity through it. 
exactly what happens when you try to start it? 
do the fans run and do you see any post messages on the screen? 
does your mb have on board graphics such that you can remove the video card and see if the pc boots?
