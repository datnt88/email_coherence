<s> now what kind of connector does you old hd have on it?? john  </s>
<s> the new hp has ata and the old slave is 40 pin  </s>
<s> i think you mean that the new computer has a 250gb serial ata (sata) drive, and your old 160gb drive is parallel ata (pata).  </s>

<s> find the cable that the cd/dvd drive is on.  </s>
<s> insert the middle connector of that cable into the back of the 160gb drive.  </s>
<s> insert a power connector into the back of the 160gb drive.  </s>
