i own a dell xps 600 desktop running a pentium d 3.2ghz processor with 2gb ram and i am looking for ways to improve the performance of my machine, if any. 
i purchased it for the purpose of using very demanding 3d graphics and modeling programs such as 3dstudiomax, maya, rhinoceros and have come to be a little disappointed in it's ability to run these programs, both from a speed side and visual performance side. is it possible to add ram to this machine, change processors, or otherwise increase the performance via operating system settings? 
what video card do you have in that system? 
that may be where you could improve things possibly.

i have dual 256mb nvidia geforce 7800 gtx with sli 
how about upgrading to 8800 gtx cards to improve performance? 
regards, jb
