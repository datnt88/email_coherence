i have a 802.11g wireless network setup in my house and would like to add 2 or 3 webcams to check on my kids and nanny during the day. 
what is the best way to get started? 
on google. 
have you been there? 
need help figuring out best way to do this. 
do i get a network webcam and a wireless network adapter or a wireless webcam? 
how do i hook up multiple cameras? 
do i need to put together a web page and pay for web hosting? 
just don't want to spend time and money going down the wrong road.
