<s> my hp1170c has been a great printer, but it is no longer working---simply worn out.  </s>
<s> at any rate, i will be discarding it and would like to know if it has a permanent memory storage that should be removed for security reasons before discarding.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any information that you can provide!  </s>

<s> there is buffer memory just used as temporary storage while printing.  </s>
<s> it's reset when power goes off.  </s>
<s> i suspected that might be the case, but wanted to make sure.  </s>
<s> appreciate your response.  </s>
