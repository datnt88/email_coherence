<s> i was using my pc the other day when i heard something hit the inside of the access panel.  </s>
<s> when i opened it i found that a small bolt attached to some kind of tension clip that was holding the bottom of the cpu's heat sink, fan housing had some how came loose in a rather violent way.  </s>
<s> it shot across the interior of the pc and hit the side access panel then i heard it hit a couple of other things,(don't know what)?  </s>
<s> when this happened the pc ran another moment then shut down.  </s>
<s> now when i go to start the pc it is getting power. the fan is running and it feels like the hard drive feels like its spinning.  </s>
<s> the outside progress light runs continuously for a moment as if it is loading the os and start up programs then gos out completely and that is all.  </s>
<s> it sends no signal to the monitor and just the fan and hard drive i believe are running. the dvd+r and cdrw optical drives both eject their trays.  </s>
<s> i tried using rescue disk without any luck, tried reformatting again with no luck.  </s>
<s> when the metal piece flew off the cpu heat sink, fan housing while the pc was running, could it have hit something and shorted out or fried the cpu, motherboard or something else? and yes i was wearing an anti static wristband when touching interior parts.  </s>
<s> ibm lenovo p4 3.06 ghz processor 2 gb ram 250 gb hard drive with 220 gb's free space winxp pro avast free edition comodo firewall malwarebytes anti amlware arovax shield before this incident everything was running smoothly  </s>
<s> from your post it may be that you didn't know about the heat sink compound.  </s>
<s> it's about one dollar of compound so i'd remove the heat sink one more time to wipe off the old and apply about one dollar of heat sink compound and button it up.  </s>
<s> worst case is the motherboard was damaged.  </s>
<s> that can be painful as this is a lenovo and if we change to a generic board the xp license dies with the motherboard.  </s>
<s> read as a primer about license death. the next failure could be the cpu fried from lack of the heatsink.  </s>
<s> while i may get the wrong cpu, pentium 4 cpu's came in a variety of packages and are now plentiful on ebay and other places for not much.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> thank you for your quick response bob! is there anyway a home user could check to see if the cpu is fried?  </s>
<s> at the shop we swap cpus.  </s>
<s> but today we rarely do that since a few shops were taken to small claims over this. the owners will not accept the cpu was dead and went to small claims.  </s>
<s> so at the shop we rarely do more than both cpu and board anymore.  </s>
<s> it's a long sad story of consumers that ruined it for everyone else.  </s>
<s> bob ps. why not one dollar of compound?  </s>
<s> tried arctic silver but no change  </s>
<s> &quot;change the cheapest part first.&quot;  </s>
<s> i missed the model number of the lenovo so i won't find the exact cpu but there are many pentium 4's out there for 20 or less bucks.  </s>
<s> usually we can sub in a slower cpu when we can't find an exact match.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i apologize, just very frustrated.  </s>
<s> now the machine is not even powering up.  </s>
<s> ibm lenovo thinkcentre a50 8085 - d5u  </s>
<s> if you type the dead pc on google you find the usual tips about stripping the machine down to the 4 parts and testing it.  </s>
<s> if the 4 parts don't power up, you are looking at the 1 to 4 possible bad parts.  </s>
<s> my advice is (repeating?) when i can't tell which part it is, and i can't use my past experience as a guide or volt meter or &quot;the green wire psu test&quot; (google) then i replace the cheapest part first.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> bob, appreciate all the info you have given me to this point.  </s>
<s> thank you! please consider post closed  </s>
