<s> hey, i'm planning to build a new computer.  </s>
<s> i have a budget of $1500.  </s>
<s> i just need some advise on what to put in it, especially the motherboard, i know nothing about motherboards.  </s>
<s> i was thinking to put in: thermaltake iii xaser case aopen ax4spe motherboard intel celeron 3.06 ghz w/hp processor twinx1024 3200ll memory maxtor 250 gb - 7200 rpm harddrive ati radeon 9800 xt 128mb graphics card creative labs audigy 2-platinum sound car dvd-rw/cd-rw combo + dvd-rom drive that comes up to about 1450 buxx.  </s>
<s> i can go over my budget by about 100-200 dollars maximum. if you think i should replace any of these parts just tell me.  </s>
<s> or if you know a better motherboard.  </s>
<s> im also interested in a dual-processor motherboard but i havent been ableto find enough info.  </s>
<s> all advice is welcome, thank you  </s>
<s> i wouldn't do this.  </s>
<s> this year may see the 64-bit changeover and if you sink too much into this machine, you may get a little upset over the 64-bit new machines.  </s>
<s> why not just get some few hundred dollar nice machine and wait it out?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i would wait if i could, but my budget has a time limit.  </s>
<s> i had sort of a grant that has to be used for that purpose within this time, or else i would so what u suggested, thanks though  </s>
<s> then go 64-bit now.  </s>
<s> notes a few suppliers and at 1,500 usd starts at under 999.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yeah, thats a good idea, i think ill do just that.  </s>
<s> so basically the only change i need to make is an amd athlon 64bit (of course) processer and a motherboard to go with it?  </s>
<s> all the rest can stay, right?  </s>
<s> thanks max  </s>

<s> thanks oh and the second link, i have to build my own, as in get the parts and throw the things together, not get it custom made by sum other company, thanks though max  </s>
<s> when you build it yourself, there are risks.  </s>
<s> new builders often do odd things like bolt the motherboard to the case without the standoffs and then take a grinder to the case to make the cards fit.  </s>
<s> even seasoned builders will often pick an undersized power supply and the machine will not boot or will develop problems shortly.  </s>
<s> are you really ready for all this? are you willing to replace a bum blown board or two? it happens... bob  </s>
<s> i have a couple of friends and connections close to where i live that could give me a hand if i dropped them an email.  </s>
<s> i understand the risk of making a small mistake and frying anything on it.  </s>
<s> another question, ok so i use a 64bit amd, right?  </s>
<s> can i get 2 and put them on a nice dual processor motherboard?  </s>
<s> do u kno a place where i can get a dual processor motherboard?  </s>
<s> &quot;today&quot; in intel-land, that's the xeon, itanium or you have to move back in time to the p3. the p4 is not dual-cpu capable.  </s>
<s> &quot;today&quot; in amd-land the duals are the athlon-mp series.  </s>
<s> i've seen a few, but remember that you often see them fitted with 600+ watt power supplies and cooling systems that are often too noisy to be in an office space.  </s>
<s> while i still have my old dual pentium pro with overdrive's, it was a lot more money than a faster cpu of next year.  </s>
<s> in fact, i could have a single faster cpu that year and bought a new machine the following year at twice the speed with the same money.  </s>
