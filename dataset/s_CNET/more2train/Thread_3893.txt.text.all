about every ten to thiry minutes, my computer restarts itself. 
it never fails, it actually happened when i was writing this post the first time. 
what could possible be causing this and what can i do to fix the problem? 
thanks 
do a simple test to see if its heat related. 
remove the case cover. 
better? 
same?
