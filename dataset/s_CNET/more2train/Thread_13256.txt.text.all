<s> i'm transitioning to wireless n for my home network to facilitate streaming hd video and basically speed everything up.  </s>
<s> we still have 1 computer that runs wireless g and often have guests that may have g as well.  </s>
<s> is it possible to hook a cheap wireless g access point like the belkin f5d7132 to my new wireless n router?  </s>
<s> my understanding is that running mixed g/n from the router will degrade the overall performance.  </s>
<s> i'm assuming that running a seperate g access point connected by ethernet will allow the router to remain 100% n but maintain g access.  </s>
<s> this forum's sticky has that setup at about post 18. try that.  </s>
<s> i understand basically how to set up the access point.  </s>
<s> i think my question is a little more basic.  </s>
<s> i need to maintain wireless g access in my home network but don't want to negatively impact the wireless n performance.  </s>
<s> i'm thinking that hard-wiring a wireless g access point from my wireless n router (d-link dir655) will let the router run pure n instead of downgrading the speed with g trafic. the access point will let my wii and guests to connect with g. true?  </s>
<s> and i rechecked the forum top sticky post. the setup to use is at post 18. you're very close to getting it working.  </s>
