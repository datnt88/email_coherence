<s> i'm looking for a new flash drive and would like some suggestions.  </s>
<s> i currrently have a 512mb cruzer titanium which is now not big enough (i got it because of it's speed).  </s>
<s> i am looking for something that has a 1 or 2gb storage capacity.  </s>
<s> i like the &quot;new&quot; cruzer titanium but don't know if it is any good.  </s>
<s> thos bigger ones(1mb or better) i've come across haven't failed yet, but most are relativity new, so i can't yes/no on any certain brand.  </s>
<s> lower capacity ones have done quite well and when they do fail, they just do, more than likely because of &quot;static/esd&quot; damage.  </s>
<s> i do find the kingston brand more to my liking as i've had a 32mb for years and still works, all others have failed, like memorex and secure jumpdrives.  </s>
<s> some other &quot;give-aways&quot; when they were 128mb or less didn't make it and died too, but they certainly lasted at least 1-2 yrs.  </s>
<s> before biting the dust.  </s>
<s> earlier cruzer drives had some glitch and i stayed away from them, but it seems they've corrected that(not recongized) or resolved it.  </s>
<s> as for any flash drives, i like those that have an easily &quot;recappable&quot; cover for the business end.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> i've got a cruzer titanium 512...nice, solid, fast; a memorex traveldrive 1gb ...light, fast and a 4gb corsair voyager...link below.  </s>
<s> all have worked well and the latter has a 1o year warranty.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> over the years i've used a variety of brands of off-system storage, including the cruiser 1gb which worked flawlessly except for the need for a clean reformat at time of purchase (can be said of most of them -- work best/most reliably if they are wiped occassionally).  </s>
<s> things to consider/watch for: - if you have a mac anywhere in your workflow (home/office/local print-house/etc), make sure the drive is cross-platform compatible. the cruiser is, although file names get truncated.  </s>
<s> - consider whether you would be better served by a dual-purpose machine, such as an ipod (which can be used for storage as well for any model except the shuffle, while still providing mp3/aiff/ac3/etc playback capabilites with the rest of the dedicated memory), or a cell-phone that takes mini-cf cards and an usb dataport, or even a digital camera with a large memory card.  </s>
<s> i have used all of these methods at various times to move data, and one of my hd-based ipods commonly serves as a field-boot drive for client macs in addition to just being an ''ipod''.  </s>
<s> - finally, consider how long you want the data, how much you'll need in a year or two, and whether a micro external hd (esata, usb-2, firewire/ieee-1394) makes sense for you.  </s>
<s> if you just need to move the occasional document, it may not, but if you move entire projects or need active back-up of your stuff, it may make better sense... cheers, =-= the cyberpoet  </s>
<s> i recently got a &quot;my flash&quot; 1g online for a very good price.  </s>
<s> i first did a google search for a &quot;1g usb&quot; and then went to one of the price comparison sites to find what i wanted for the best price.  </s>
<s> you should also check local weekly sales at such places as staples, office max, etc. they sometimes have outrageous sales.  </s>
<s> i recently had a friend pick up a 512 usb for $15. and thats it!  </s>
<s> office max, staples, circuit city and comq usa all have had the 1gbyte for $25 the past few weeks (rebate) and 512 mbyte for $ 15-18.00.  </s>
<s> yes the cruzers have a nice, tough body.  </s>
<s> but they are all just memory chips and unless you know who provides the vendor the chips buy by price.  </s>
<s> with the advent of large, large scale chips which is replacing discrete electronic components and everything is manufacture in china or indonoesia......quality is more uniform.  </s>
<s> if u buy from retailers like staples, cc, zipzoomfly, and newegg, this shouldn't be an issue.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure ot the extent they test for opened returns and refurbs, but even so, u could get your $$ back on grounds of defectiveness.  </s>
<s> if purchasing from a site where more dubious selling conditions are possible like ebay, u'll wanna check that your 1gb, 2gb, or 4gb flash memory can really hold that capacity.  </s>
<s> sometimes they just use 32mb to 512mb chipsets and disguish it so windows sees the full, claimed capacity.  </s>
<s> when u go and try to use all that capacity however, u get corruption errors since that extra capacity in truth does not exist.  </s>
<s> a simple to perform is to write a single 900mb file onto a 1gb flash memory, and then try to read or load off it.  </s>
<s> while usb speeds vary betw pcs, if you're certain it keeps writing/reading &quot;infinitely&quot;, then you may have a fake capacity.  </s>
<s> i got an retail memorex 512mb usb flash memory from staples just under a year ago.  </s>
<s> it costed $20 w/o requiring any mirs.  </s>
<s> came with driver cd, lanyard, and warranty info.  </s>
<s> one day, i couldn't find it.  </s>
<s> searched everywhere i could've thought of, but nowhere to be found i got an oem memorex 1gb flash mem for $32 back in early april this year from 3btech.  </s>
<s> it's just the module and the protective cap over the plug.  </s>
<s> bought some lanyards from a one-dollar store and strung that up.  </s>
<s> as of now, it hasn't failed on me yet.  </s>
<s> i'm partial to the sandisk cruzer, and staples has them on sale this week--after all the rebates it's $22.98 for 1gb.  </s>
<s> if you have a brand you like, i'd just wait until they go on sale and try to get the lowest price you can.  </s>
<s> i've never had any major problems with staple's mail in rebates, but some ppl do not like them at all.  </s>
<s> u can still get cheap stuff w/o mirs, but u'll need to be patient, and your selection will be less  </s>
<s> just got a 1gb corsair flash drive from new egg for $24.99 which included free 3 day shipping.  </s>
<s> i ordered it tuesday and already have it.  </s>
<s> there were many good reviews for this particular flash drive so i thought i would mention it.  </s>
<s> it comes with a lanyard, cd for win98 (should anyone have that), and an extension.  </s>
<s> seemed like a good deal.  </s>
