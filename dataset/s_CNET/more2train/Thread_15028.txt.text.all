i recently tried a linksys usb adaptor w/ my desktop, but it must not have had a long enough range because it could not find the wireless connection that our city has now. 
what wireless adaptor would you recommend for my desktop that has a significant range so that i can get access from my home? 
thanks!

i use a d-link and it can pick up signals from about 325 feet. 
if you want the model number, i can get it for you.
