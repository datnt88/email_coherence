<s> just over a year ago i purchased a maxtor shared storage ii nas drive.  </s>
<s> my needs were basic; all i wanted to do was serve mp3 files to my sonos streaming music system.  </s>
<s> problem was, only after i bought the drive did i find out about it's record of unreliability, and sure enough after 6 months it started to play up.  </s>
<s> a few tips off the web plus a few hours talking to maxtor did get it up and running, but i still didn't trust it so backed up my crucial files to dvd. that proved wise; almost the day it went out of warranty it's failed completely, so now i'm in the market another solution.  </s>
<s> my needs have changed slightly though... - serve content to my sonos as before (i only have a measly 15gb of music right now, though); - provide a reliable backup solution for the two laptops my partner and i use (i think that means i need raid 1 config, correct?); - in future, serve hd video content to my main tv. the backup piece is probably the most important thing for me now - i've just bought a new digital slr and have a baby on the way, so i need to be able to backup my files safely, reliably and with the minimum of fuss.  </s>
<s> speed is not so crucial - as long as it can keep up with pushing 720p content down a wired link to the tv, that should be good enough.  </s>
<s> i've taken a look online, but have become rather confused by the options on offer.  </s>
<s> what would people suggest?  </s>
<s> i have up to 300 to spend on the right solution.  </s>
<s> i'm a technology lover, but not a techie - i'm not against buying a nas cage and installing drives if that's the most reliable option, but i don't want to spend hour after frustrating hour setting it up only to get unreliable performance.  </s>
<s> as a result i like the look of the buffalo linkstation pro duo, but don't know much about it - are the drives possible to replace if one fails?  </s>
<s> any suggestions would be much appreciated - frankly i'm surprised at how few of the consumer targetted nas solutions get a good writeup!  </s>
<s> thanks in advance, matt  </s>
<s> no suggestions from anyone?  </s>
<s> would be much appreciated...thanks!  </s>

<s> anyone have any ideas on this one?  </s>
<s> thanks, matt  </s>
<s> i'd consider the apple time machine.  </s>
