just over a year ago i purchased a maxtor shared storage ii nas drive. 
my needs were basic; all i wanted to do was serve mp3 files to my sonos streaming music system. 
problem was, only after i bought the drive did i find out about it's record of unreliability, and sure enough after 6 months it started to play up. 
a few tips off the web plus a few hours talking to maxtor did get it up and running, but i still didn't trust it so backed up my crucial files to dvd. that proved wise; almost the day it went out of warranty it's failed completely, so now i'm in the market another solution. 
my needs have changed slightly though... - serve content to my sonos as before (i only have a measly 15gb of music right now, though); - provide a reliable backup solution for the two laptops my partner and i use (i think that means i need raid 1 config, correct?); - in future, serve hd video content to my main tv. the backup piece is probably the most important thing for me now - i've just bought a new digital slr and have a baby on the way, so i need to be able to backup my files safely, reliably and with the minimum of fuss. 
speed is not so crucial - as long as it can keep up with pushing 720p content down a wired link to the tv, that should be good enough. 
i've taken a look online, but have become rather confused by the options on offer. 
what would people suggest? 
i have up to 300 to spend on the right solution. 
i'm a technology lover, but not a techie - i'm not against buying a nas cage and installing drives if that's the most reliable option, but i don't want to spend hour after frustrating hour setting it up only to get unreliable performance. 
as a result i like the look of the buffalo linkstation pro duo, but don't know much about it - are the drives possible to replace if one fails? 
any suggestions would be much appreciated - frankly i'm surprised at how few of the consumer targetted nas solutions get a good writeup! 
thanks in advance, matt 
no suggestions from anyone? 
would be much appreciated...thanks! 
matt 
anyone have any ideas on this one? 
thanks, matt 
i'd consider the apple time machine.
