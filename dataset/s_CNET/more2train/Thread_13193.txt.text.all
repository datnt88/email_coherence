<s> quick run down of my setup before i get to my question.  </s>
<s> boot drive: 128gb ssd media drive: 2tb internal hdd 1st backup: 3tb external hdd 2nd backup: 3tb external hdd i keep most of my stuff on the external now, really only leaving stuff i regularly listen to /watch on the internal drives.  </s>
<s> i'm using synctoy 2.1 to mirror one drive onto the other, i would have liked to triple save it with a third 3tb, but with my budget two will have to do for now.  </s>
<s> my question is whether or not i can have the external drives stop spinning while plugged in.  </s>
<s> i know that in the power options i can set the hard drive to turn off after a while, but i think that's just for when the whole computer goes to sleep.  </s>
<s> i've been running folding at home continuously for over a month now, and i'd like to keep doing that so sleeping isn't an option for me anymore.  </s>
<s> but i worry that these external 3tb drives are kind of cheap (i got them each for around 115$ - 120$), so... when not using them i'd like them to just go to sleep.  </s>
<s> i'm not an expert on this, but i imagine less strain and heat will help them last longer.  </s>
<s> i looked in disk management but all i'm really seeing here is ways of formatting the drives (which is certainly not what i want to do).  </s>
<s> i figured i could just unplug them and replug them when needed, but i know that doing that excessively can wear out the ports, which could just as easily kill my ability to use the drives.  </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> while i read what you want, i've seen this area to be a little out of sight for the makers of the pcs and more.  </s>
<s> that is, i found no maker or os writer to get the band to play in unison.  </s>
<s> i've had such drives last for so long with then spinning that what happens is they become too small over time.  </s>
<s> my original 200mb external still worked but with a 1gb usb stick hitting you know a happy meal price, it had to go.  </s>
<s> good luck in getting the industry to play along.  </s>

<s> so... short answer no, there's no way?  </s>
<s> shame.  </s>
<s> thanks for answering at least. the other tech-help forums i asked seem to have ignored my question.  </s>
<s> it may or may not work.  </s>
<s> and no one seems to respond about it.  </s>
<s> at least the drives under normal temperatures and such should spin for 5 or more years.  </s>
<s> spinning down from what i see (at the office we have some embedded recorders with hdds) had no effect on aging.  </s>
