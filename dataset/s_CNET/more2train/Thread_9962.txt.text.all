<s> i have this cable: i have a hp pavilion a1025c, i want to take this cable and hook it up to my 17&quot; lcd, and hook it to my 32&quot; tv (the tv has vga and i tested it and it works).  </s>
<s> i hooked it all up, and both the lcd moniter and tv wont show a picture, says nothing is connected.  </s>
<s> i dont know if my pc is missing some type of driver?  </s>
<s> or not compatible with 2 moniters?  </s>
<s> i got 2 of these cables for free.  </s>
<s> says on the cable (sonet) i looked it up and i could find cables, but not this one.  </s>
<s> any help would be greatfull.  </s>
<s> but some do not work.  </s>
<s> and the simple splitters often are not wired proper.  </s>
<s> one last try.  </s>
<s> connect just one display without the cable.  </s>
<s> working?  </s>
<s> ok, now try the splitter (just one display still.) no go? then it's junk.  </s>

<s> still wont work, can you recomend some type, i would like to view my lcd moniter, and on the lcd tv at the same time, i was looking into a converter, but i was thinking of trying to keep it vga. is there a box that i can hook pc vga to the box, then vga to the moniter, and tv. i think vga comes in better than avi.  </s>
<s> any advice would help.  </s>
<s> oh, and is there a good one like this, that works?  </s>
<s> i have 2 of these and they both dont work.  </s>
<s> given the price you paid there isn't much to say here.  </s>
<s> try newegg.com and read customer comments about the prospective unit.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> found this: i seen some good reviews on this, and its reasonabley priced think it will do its job?  </s>
<s> while it will likely do the split (others say so) i don't have the unit or the full details of video mode you tried to split.  </s>
<s> such didn't matter in the case of what you had since the test failed.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i am going to use it to play dvds from my computer, picture slideshows stuff like that, if i connect my computer directly to it i have to disconnect the moniter, im wondering if i get this how i will set it up, because on the lcd tv i have to set the windows text biger because its so small and i cant see it far away.  </s>
<s> i wonder how that would work, is there a way to use 2 gfx cards with vga or something?  </s>
<s> at beyond 1024x768 some of these splitters may smear a little.  </s>
<s> other than that should be fine.  </s>
