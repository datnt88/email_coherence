<s> i recently converted all family videos (dating back to the 50's) onto dvd.  </s>
<s> i have two copies of each.  </s>
<s> one kept at a relatives house.  </s>
<s> and the other in the safe at my house.  </s>
<s> i know dvds don't last forever, so how often should i re-burn them all?  </s>
<s> is there anything else i should do to make sure they are safe?  </s>
<s> should i rip them all to my hard drive as well, even if its going to take 50gb?  </s>
<s> in theory they should last for years, but how can we be sure?  </s>
<s> you might slip a disk into the drive tomorrow and 'bang', it's gone.  </s>
<s> by burning them to dvd rather than having just one copy stored on a hard drive you have done the sensible thing.  </s>
<s> too many don't even do that and when the hard drive fails they lose everything.  </s>
<s> you can certainly copy them to your hard drive and that makes watching them more convenient, but hard drives fail quicker than cd/dvd, so those backups in the safe are important.  </s>
<s> i would never treat anything saved onto an internal hard drive as a backup copy.  </s>
<s> backing up to an external hard drive may be as good as you can store the hard drive somewhere as well.  </s>
<s> but just remember that external hard drives are just as prone to break as internal.  </s>
<s> as long as you have one good working backup copy, as well as the originals, then that should be fine.  </s>
<s> but as soon as one fails, backup again.  </s>
<s> perhaps a 2nd set of dvd's might allow you to feel more secure.  </s>
<s> remember though, as technology moves on and improves, better backup options might arise.  </s>
<s> mark  </s>
<s> hmm, well a lot of the originals are reel-to-reel tapes that are already degraded.  </s>
<s> so they can't be trusted.  </s>
<s> so i guess i should have a copy on my hard drive (i change my computer every few years, so its going to move with me through the years).  </s>
<s> then have two dvd copies, one stored at my house, the other somewhere else. then i just have to check the dvds every so often i guess.  </s>
<s> i just wish there was a more reliable back up option.  </s>
