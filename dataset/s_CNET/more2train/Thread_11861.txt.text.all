having problems with an optical drive. 
if you place a known good disk in the drive and access the data on the disk it will not eject from the button on the drive. 
however you can still eject the disk by going to the drive in my computer and right clicking it and selecting eject. 
but, however you can insert a disk into the drive and after it has registered the disk but before you access the data you can eject it with the button on the drive. 
all the cd recording software makers including roxio, nero, others had a bug at one time that did that. 
while you didn't share much, a patch usually fixed it.

thank you very much for the quick response. 
the pc has both roxio and nero on it.
