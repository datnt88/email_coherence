<s> im a gamer....i play battlefield 2, fear, doom 3 and want to play upcoming games (example crysis) whats a better deal e6400 or e6600? is it worth the extra $100 for e6600  </s>
<s> you gave no name brand so i can not tell you what you are talking about i do know from the nubers u mention that it is a geforce card you are talking about and as a proud owner of a bfg 6600gt oc lifetime(maximum pc)limited warrenty i could not go wrong as when i baught my card it was the 5900 flavor and when it went bad it got replace with a higher model becuase they no longer stocked the newer models (now that is the shizzzzzzzznick) so that gives you something to crunch on before you purchase any video card for any pc i get decent frames on the net between 40-50 which your eyes can not see past 35 frames per second any ways so it works good but anything faster is always better so if you have over a 2 giga hertz machine and the cash flow max it out to the 7 series 512 megs of ram and stop playing around wasting money on card after card it is hard to find an agp version of this series so you may have to search some and dont buy anything used or second hand if you have serious cash flow build a new rig all together and max that puppy out to sli and use a dual core processor and dual 7800 ultra 512 then you become the fragger not the fraggy  </s>
<s> if i am right and you were comparing the core duo e6400 to the core duo e6600 and nothing to do with graphics cards then this site might be useful.  </s>
<s> it compares all the latest processor's on loads of benchmarks so you can decide yourself if its worth it: hope it helps!  </s>
<s> i assume this is a new build, so a better video card will help you more.  </s>
<s> unless you've already got a 7900gtx/x1900xt or better, a better video card will be able to maintain high framerates at high resolutions and with all effects on more than an cpu bump.  </s>
<s> the 6300 and 6400 are 2mb cache based chips the 6600, 6700 and 6800 extreme are all 4mb chips but the clock speed difference between the 6300 and 6400 is the same jump from 6400 to 6600.  </s>
<s> why didnt they just call it a 6500?  </s>
<s> probably because down the line they can either make a 6400 with 4mb and call it a 6500, or they can make a 6600 with 2mb and call it a 6500.  </s>
<s> good old intel marketing.  </s>
<s> overall the cost per ghz of the 6300 and 6400 are very close to each other. the 6600 jumps this up a little bit, but not by a huge margin. the 6700 and 6800e are however much more expensive per ghz and really not worth the $ imho.  </s>
<s> i would say something similar to one of the others.  </s>
<s> if your into gaming, make sure you have a decent video card like the gtx or even the gx2.  </s>
<s> if you already have a 7800/7900 gtx or better, or if you were already planning to spend that kind of cash to get one, and the cpu wouldnt be taking away from your video card budget, then i would pop for the 6600.  </s>
<s> if your trying to do this on a budget and the chip would eat into your video card, then i agree with the other poster.  </s>
<s> get the 6400 and then pop got a gtx or gx2 as opposed to a gt or 7600.  </s>
<s> if your replacing your mobo as well, take a look at anandtech on the asus p5b i think it was.  </s>
<s> they just added a feature that allows you to underclock the multiplier on normal core2 cpus which if you wanted to do a simple overclock can be very helpful.  </s>
<s> you can apparently quite easily jump the fsb on a 6400 from 266 (266x4=1066) up to 400 (400x4=1600) and then drop the multiplier down from 8 to 7 (2.8ghz) or 6 (2.4ghz) which are still both higher than native (2.13ghz). the newer ddr2 800 memory is actually 400x2 (ddr = double data rate) and thus you can do a fsb to memory of 1:1 which is fully supported.  </s>
<s> anandtech has all this info in gross detail, but i thought it was so neat i would mention it here.  </s>
<s> they did all their testing with stock intel cooling too, so no need for any crazy water cooling.  </s>
<s> asus made this work first, but i wouldnt be surprised to see others having similar features by year end.  </s>
<s> hey casper, saw you are new here on the forums and just wanted to say welcome and thanks for your excellent post.  </s>
<s> i pointed a friend to your advice and it helped him make a decision that i was having some difficulty explaining to him.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
