<s> hey guys, i wasn't exactly sure where to put this.  </s>
<s> so i thought the general section would be a good bet.  </s>
<s> anyways, here is my dilemma.  </s>
<s> currently i'm looking to upgrade the ram on my pc. i have an acer aspire m1100 desktop and my processor is a amd athlon 64 processor 4000+ 2.60 ghz the main issue(i believe?) is that my ram is horrific.  </s>
<s> i only have 1 gb.  </s>
<s> so essentially, any pc game made after 2008 doesn't run, at all.  </s>
<s> even league of legends, which i feel isn't too bad resource wise.  </s>
<s> i have to play on &quot;very low&quot; graphics, no shadows and sound off to even get to 35 fps, and i even have to kill processes to do so.  </s>
<s> this isn't counting games like dota2 which don't even load, or minecraft which lags unless i turn everything down.  </s>
<s> so my question is this, how big of an improvement would i see if i upgraded to say, 2 gb of ram? or say i decided to jump up to 4gb or 8gb of ram.  </s>
<s> my pc would not explode, correct?  </s>
<s> or at the very least, would it even be compatible to run 4 or 8 gb of ram? and would the performance be stellar?  </s>
<s> thank you so much for your time, and reading through all that stuff!  </s>
<s> no it won't blow up. the perf should get a nice bump.  </s>
<s> if you have a 32 bit os don't go over 4gb.  </s>
<s> give you more bang for the buck.  </s>
<s> only problem is you only have a 250w psu....you'll probably need more to run a higher performance video card.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> i'd try the usual 1gb ati 5450 card.  </s>
<s> found around for 20 to 30ish bucks on newegg.  </s>
