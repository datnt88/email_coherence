i'm having networking problems with both types of connections (ethernet & wireless card). the ethernet doesn't even show a link led. the wireless shows activity blinks but doesn't detect the network. 
(i'm using a dial-up connection right now and it's frustrating lol). 
what i've done: tried different cables. 
(crossover & also straight) checked on a different lap to see if the ap is working fine and configured correctly. 
on the other lap the ap connects succesfully wireless. 
only 1 laptop is connected at a time. 
uninstalled & reinstalled the wireless card. 
deleted the wireless connection and created a new one. 
get rid of sp2 for winxp and reinstalled. 
update driver on 3com ethernet adapter. 
nothing worked!!! here are my ipconfig results: microsoft windows xp [version 5.1.2600]

winsockfix repairs some of the damage spyware does to windows. 
here's the link -&gt; 
thank you for your advice. 
i did it but still having the problem. 
i forgot to post that i also have run ad-aware se, lsp fix for winsock2 repair and also tried with firewall on and off. 
what seems strange to me is that the result showed in the ipconfig for both adapters is media disconnected. 
unless the cable is really broken.
