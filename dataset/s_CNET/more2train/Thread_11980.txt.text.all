<s> i am currently running peoplepc dialup with the accelerator, which is horrible connecting at speeds of about 33.6 average.  </s>
<s> i live in the middle of nowhere which makes highspeed out of the question, so i am stuck with dial up until they load highspeed in my area,and satelitte is out of my budget, so i was wondering if there is a device that i can buy to speed up my speed.  </s>
<s> i am desperate at this point.  </s>
<s> dialup worked fairly well when just text was being sent.  </s>
<s> nowdays web sites are designed for broadband....large content.  </s>

<s> look here.  </s>
<s> this might be a bit expensive and out of your budget but you can take a look into it and see, modem bonding:  </s>
