i am currently running peoplepc dialup with the accelerator, which is horrible connecting at speeds of about 33.6 average. 
i live in the middle of nowhere which makes highspeed out of the question, so i am stuck with dial up until they load highspeed in my area,and satelitte is out of my budget, so i was wondering if there is a device that i can buy to speed up my speed. 
i am desperate at this point. 
dialup worked fairly well when just text was being sent. 
nowdays web sites are designed for broadband....large content. 
something that might help a little is a host file. 
it won't help your download speed but it might block some of those big ads/graphics which will make some web pages load a little quicker. 
look here. 
this might be a bit expensive and out of your budget but you can take a look into it and see, modem bonding:
