<s> one of the nvidia 7600gt graphics cards connected to my evga board stopped working.  </s>
<s> when i pulled it out i noticed 4 of those round capacitors had broken tops.  </s>
<s> as if something had exploded through it.  </s>
<s> one capacitor on the other card is the same. is that supposed to happen, when the card gets old or too hot? its only 2 years old this is my first time seeing a graphics card and putting a system together can anyone explain this?  </s>
<s> thanx for any information.  </s>
<s> if you type bad caps at google you learn the story.  </s>
<s> it's not the card maker but bad corporate espionage with a stolen formula that was incomplete.  </s>
<s> you now see these by the thousands.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> nvidia supposedly had a bad rash of bad video cards that was reported to have bad caps issue.  </s>
<s> i don't recall all the models but this was 1-2yrs.  </s>
<s> ago and users had several complaints filed, so google for such to narrow it down.  </s>
<s> i believe they were 8xxx series, which they fixed by the vendor/maker, thus brands like pny, xfx, and others got the fix/repair for nvidia chipsets.  </s>
<s> in many cases, a s/w fix was to slowdown the video port in order to help cool it.  </s>
<s> this is not the same issue of poorly manufactured caps, but the rather the chipsets.  </s>
<s> the side effect is blown caps which look just like &quot;bad caps&quot; once googled.  </s>
<s> be aware poor cooling can also result in blown caps, thus be sure whatever cooling is being offered actually does the job.  </s>
<s> video cards can get into stressed conditions all too fast.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> thanks to both of you guys for the knowledge.  </s>
<s> i did many hours of research on those cards and still picked the wrong ones!  </s>
<s> oh well thanks again.  </s>
