hi: i've got a friend who wants to set up a wireless network at home, the thing is he is already using a wired modem/router with 4 ports. 
so im wondering to set up a wireless network, is the best option just to buy a wireless modem/router and replace the wired one? 
or is it possible to get a wireless router only and use that with the wired modem/router? 
if it's possible, how would i go about doing that? 
cheers 
you could add a wireless access point -- but a used wireless router is a lot cheaper and ex-isp models turn up all the time due to customer churn. 
obviously to replace the existing router you'll need to apply the right settings to match your isp's requirements -- see their home site for any help files on how to set up common brands of router. 
if you get a used ex-isp wireless router and find it is locked to an isp just add it as a wap to the existing router --- see following link: 
thanks for the advice
