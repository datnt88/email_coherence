<s> hi: i've got a friend who wants to set up a wireless network at home, the thing is he is already using a wired modem/router with 4 ports.  </s>
<s> so im wondering to set up a wireless network, is the best option just to buy a wireless modem/router and replace the wired one?  </s>
<s> or is it possible to get a wireless router only and use that with the wired modem/router?  </s>
<s> if it's possible, how would i go about doing that?  </s>
<s> cheers  </s>
<s> you could add a wireless access point -- but a used wireless router is a lot cheaper and ex-isp models turn up all the time due to customer churn.  </s>
<s> obviously to replace the existing router you'll need to apply the right settings to match your isp's requirements -- see their home site for any help files on how to set up common brands of router.  </s>
<s> if you get a used ex-isp wireless router and find it is locked to an isp just add it as a wap to the existing router --- see following link:  </s>
<s> thanks for the advice  </s>
