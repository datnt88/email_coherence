i currently have a sent of the logitech z-5300e and want to know the frequency range of just the satellite speakers (ie not with the sub). 
i typed the following into google.com: 
logitech z-5300e this is one of the first links that came up in the search: i then clicked on the &quot;specifications&quot; tab and saw that its frequency response is 35hz - 20khz. 
see if you can see a part number for the just the satellites. 
i couldn't find one at logitech.com. 
i've tried all that and i even emailed logitech about it but they gave me the same response you did (35hz-20khz) so not very helpful. 
i'm not too sure where i'd find a part number either, there isn't much on the speaker itself.
