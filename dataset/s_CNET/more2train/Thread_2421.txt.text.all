<s> 1. can you boot from said device? 2. while the os could reveal where the off switch for the floppy can be, i'll note that in most versions of tweakui, you can hide drive letters in explorer with tweakui. the test for this one is to open a command prompt, stick a diskette into a: and type... dir a: bob  </s>
<s> i am unable to boot from the floppy.  </s>
<s> i don't have tweakui but i tried the command promt thing you mentioned and it reflects the items on diskettes.  </s>
<s> thanks, caktus  </s>
<s> it matters not if you had tweakui or not.  </s>
<s> malware and other programs can hide drive letters from explorer.  </s>
<s> it's unfortunate that you can't boot from said disk drive, but we'll ignore that for now.  </s>
<s> in the future, do take heed from the tip that is supplied with every post and tell the os in question.  </s>

<s> i downloaded tweakui from two sources (ms and annoyances.org.) in each case the install process was supposed to provide a shortcut in the control panel but did not.  </s>

<s> file dosen't seem to mention anything about this problem.  </s>
<s> any guidence on this matter?  </s>
<s> thanks, caktus  </s>
<s> that was a problem about this version of tweakui.  </s>
<s> once you read how to install tweakui, proceed to the panel that allows you to show/hide drive letters and make sure all are allowed.  </s>
<s> tweakui installs by a right-click on the .inf and then selecting install.  </s>
<s> maybe you tried that, but didn't write you did.  </s>

<s> bob, i finally got tweakui installed.  </s>
<s> my problem was i didn't realize it had to be installed to it's own download folder to end up in the control panel.  </s>
<s> i see tweakui has alot of little goodies.  </s>
<s> it appears now i can sometimes tweak w/o being afraid of the messing up the registry.  </s>
