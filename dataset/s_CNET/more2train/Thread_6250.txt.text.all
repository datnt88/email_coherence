<s> whilst reinstalling my tevion dvb-t 100 digital tv program after a system reinstal, i got following message:- &quot;access violation at address 004fde72 in module &quot;dvtr.exe&quot;.  </s>
<s> read of address 00000000&quot; can anyone please help?  </s>
<s> after trying to instal about six times, i contacted the manufacturer's help line but they can't help.  </s>
<s> i have used this before without any problems.  </s>
<s> i use xp professional (sp3)  </s>
<s> i take it that no-one is familiar with this type of fault.  </s>
<s> is that error reference something that could be fixed in the registry?  </s>
<s> only the author of the application may be able to tell you why it did that.  </s>
<s> can you go back to when it worked?  </s>
