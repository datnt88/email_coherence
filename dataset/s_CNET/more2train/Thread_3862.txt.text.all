yikes, when redoing my chipset fan something happened to the cpu settings, i got some errors on startup -- one was a &quot;checksum error, resetting to defaults,&quot; the next one was &quot;cpu is unworkable or has been changed.&quot; 
so i assume i am running at a slower clock in there . 
. . 
this is an abit kd7a mobo, i cannot remember what the speed of the cpu is, bought it 2 yrs ago i think. 
any advice on how to approach this? would love to be up to max cpu speed! 
i remmeber setting the cpu speed higher in cmos long ago, but i don't have any numbers to reference now. 
are they on the cpu? 
i don't know the bios type either. 
all advice appreciated!! --fj 
well after various retstarts i am seeing an occasional reference at startup to amd 2200xp, ddr 333 also, do i need a new mobo battery?? much confusion here. 
thanks - fj 
configuration. happy ending - fj 
...taking out the battery and putting it back in.
