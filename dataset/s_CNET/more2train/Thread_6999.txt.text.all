<s> i recently bought a 20&quot; flat panel and i want to improve my video performance.  </s>
<s> these are the specs on my pc: pentium iii 800 mhz 512 mb sdram 100 mhz nvidia geforce ddr 64 mb agp 1x/2x/4x would i see any noticeable improvement if i just added a mid-level video card like the ati radeon 9600 128 mb w/ dvi out or would the cpu/ram require upgrading as well?  </s>
<s> thanks is advance, p|&lt;  </s>
<s> by video performance, do you mean gaming (i think not with a 800 mhz system)?  </s>
<s> upgrading a video card for better &quot;video-quality&quot; is almost useless, unless your current video card doesn't support your monitors' native resolution.  </s>
<s> you may get more options such as brightness controls or such, but that won't warrent the money for a new card.  </s>
<s> it's a marriage arrangement, that they have to be in par with each other for optimum output.  </s>
<s> if you can find a geforce with increased ram of 128 or better of the same type video card, that's your best chance.  </s>
<s> yes, you will need to increase the system speed(cpu) to keep up with one of the newer cards.  </s>
<s> however, you can throttle down a new video card with its setup s/w for a less demanding but certainly better than old output.  </s>
<s> check their support website for details.  </s>
<s> also, newer agp video may outstrip(added connection) the power supply as now they require 30w+ where as older units are 20-25w range, take that into condiration.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
<s> before i opened my wallet i would look into free stuff like finding the proper mobo and vid drivers that mated to the os i was using and gave me the best perf.  </s>
<s> don't assume the newest drivers are best, you must test.  </s>
<s> i don't know what type of vid perf your looking for but i suspect that 800cpu and 100memory are going to be a problem.  </s>
