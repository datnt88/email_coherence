<s> i am in the process of trying to make to most of my new super-router.  </s>
<s> one of the challenges is to allow two work laptops tied to respective corporate domains to share not only the basic wlan/internet connection (that bit works already), but also to use the hp laserjet 10221 printer connected via usb to the wl-700ge and hopefully also access the disk drive.  </s>
<s> my home network is a windows workgroup (w2k pro sp4) and i cannot change the network settings of the work laptops (with windows xp).  </s>
<s> i there a way to solve this problem?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance p.s. imho, asus has some unutilized opportunities to improve the wl-700ge manual...  </s>

<s> dear bob, my point is that i own and control the asus wl-700ge and would like to use it without any need to make changes on the work laptops.  </s>
<s> i fail to understand what my bona fide quuestion has to do with forum policies.  </s>
<s> since i am using my work laptop via vpn it would be detrimental to mess around its setup in any way.  </s>
<s> i hope someone can help me with this.  </s>
<s> to configuring the router to make it work since most &quot;work&quot; laptops need a domain to log into.  </s>
<s> you can't fake that with a router. the forum policies are very clear about help to thwart some business or it's control.  </s>
<s> you may feel it's ok to discuss such but the forum policies forbid it.  </s>
<s> sorry and hopefully it will dawn on you why the router settings are not the cure.  </s>
<s> i have found the beer solution to work on most it staff.  </s>
