<s> hello, i am looking for a washable, flexible, 109-key, usb full sized keyboard with, preferably, normal placement of the arrow keys, an enter key that is of a decent size (and is the backwards l type), a full sized backspace key, the full top row of f# keys, etc. etc. i don't know which brand of &quot;flexible and washable&quot; keyboards to get, or which model to get if i *do* decide.  </s>
<s> has anyone done a comparison of any of the keyboards from seal shield, tripp lite, adesso, grandtec, true touch, modtek, targus, etc.? also, how can i figure out if one of these is just a rebranded version of another?  </s>
<s> which of these companies is still alive and supporting their product?  </s>
<s> do any of these keyboards have anything physically different with the f and j keys, to find the home keys by touch?  </s>
<s> if so, which?  </s>
<s> which brands have the lowest incidents of stuck keys for their latest models?  </s>
<s> i am in the states, and would like to pay under $40 for a keyboard (these seem to be relatively inexpensive, which does help!), and i don't know what to get.  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated!  </s>
<s> i have identified these models of being 'of interest'.  </s>
<s> does anyone have any thoughts on any of them, or any comparisons?  </s>
<s> seal shield seal flex ssf106 tripp lite in3009kp adesso akb-230 grandtec flx-2000 manhattan true touch roll up keyboard targus akb13ca thanks!  </s>
<s> pre-script: i took the liberty to clean up the detour. the tripp lite in3009kp is a no hitter.  </s>
<s> adesso, targus are still in business. the others i'm not so sure of.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> that particular keyboard is really hard to find on their webpage, but that does seem to be the model number!  </s>
<s> heh, you found one of hte other places that i posted this question.  </s>
<s> now can you find the other 19? =)  </s>
