<s> i have a windows xp sp3 pc with the generic bt 5.1.26 radio driver and the same version.  </s>
<s> windows bt enumerator i am having no trouble adding an android device ( htc evo ) however, there is no connection held after the successful password matching....... is there a newer driver that will help this connection error?  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> the bluetooth dongle on the pc is a cambridge silicon radio.  </s>
<s> it does pair ok, but after the passphrase exchange is successful, the connection fails.  </s>
<s> i am assuming this can be fixed with a driver update, which i have had no luck finding after a pretty exhaustive search.  </s>
<s> but i found it cheap enough at 5 or so bucks to toss (actually i give the ones i don't like away) it and replace it with units that don't need more than the native microsoft bluetooth drivers and stack.  </s>
<s> since you have the packaging you stand a better chance of finding the maker's web site than most.  </s>
