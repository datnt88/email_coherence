i have a hp a6407c amd 64x2 4400+ 2.3gh pc with nvidia geforce 6800 card. 
i have no idea how to figure out what video upgrade i can use. 
i want one with at least 1g for playing wow and other games. 
any help is appreciated. 
happy holidays to all 
or download cpu-z ( ) to determine if you have a pci-express or agp graphics slot. 
if agp, your options will be very limited since it is obsolete. 
if you are going to install an after market vid card in the hp system you would do well to also replace the psu, the standard psu will not likely fly a 1gb card very well, if at all. 
i would suggest going with the 4000 ati series, it actually doenst matter if you use 512 mb or 1 gb in terms of power usage
