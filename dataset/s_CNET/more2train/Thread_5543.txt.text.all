<s> will microsoft student run on new intel macs?  </s>
<s> i need that software because i have to do homework on microsoft word.  </s>
<s> also can anyone give me a list of important programs for a high school student that has a band, plays games, and wants to run windows on his mac as second os(boot camp or the virtual computers?).  </s>
<s> the software is actually called ms office 2004 for mac, student & teacher edition.  </s>
<s> as yet, ms has not released a universal binary version of the product but the original will run using the rosetta emulation.  </s>
<s> using word, you will almost certainly not notice any difference.  </s>
<s> others that are closer to high school age would be better suited to pass information about that, but the mac has garage band which is an amazing piece of software.  </s>
<s> p  </s>
<s> i just had a thought.  </s>
<s> maybe there is a piece of software called ms student.  </s>
<s> i'll have to check that p  </s>
