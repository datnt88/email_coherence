<s> i'm having lots of grief in configuring my wireless network.  </s>
<s> last week, before i moved, everything was working fine.  </s>
<s> i had cable internet, my desktop pc was connected directly to my wireless router, and my laptop used wireless to connect to the network.  </s>
<s> on the weekend i moved, changed isps, added a voip terminal, and am now trying to configure both my pc and laptop with wireless cards.  </s>
<s> here's my layout: cable -&gt; cable modem -&gt; voip terminal -&gt; wireless router after experimenting a long while last night, i was able to get either my laptop or my desktop connected, but not both!  </s>
<s> both pcs are running win xp sp2.  </s>
<s> here's what i know for sure: - the internet connection itself is working.  </s>
<s> i can connect to wherever at one of the computers.  </s>
<s> - the restriction doesn't have to do with the acl on the wireless router (as i've disabled it and still have the problem) - the problem doesn't appear to be security related, as i can remove all security on the router and still have the same problem - i reserved two ips on the router, one for the desktop, one for the laptop, and configured their wireless cards to use these ips.  </s>
<s> this doesn't seem to be the problem, but i could be wrong.  </s>
<s> - the pc that can't connect is getting dns information, but not much else. if i ping google.com, it resolves to an ip, but i never get a response.  </s>
<s> also, from this pc i can't ping other pcs on the network or the router.  </s>
<s> - both pcs are connecting to the wireless network, but one of them can't connect to the internet or to anything else on the network.  </s>
<s> does anyone have any thoughts on what might be wrong, or what else i could do to diagnose and fix the problem?  </s>
<s> let dhcp assign the ip's... just for trouble shooting, remove the voip terminal..  </s>
<s> i had a similar problem.  </s>
<s> i powered everything down and rebooted in the order you have them linked and making sure that each device was completely booted before powering on the next device.  </s>
<s> 1. you may want to post the output from &quot;ipconfig/all&quot; on both computers, so we have more information to go on by. 2. do you have any other virtual or physical network cards installed on the problematic computer?  </s>
<s> (ie.  </s>
<s> vmware, vpn, etc.) 3. have you tried using dhcp as opposed to static mapping?  </s>
<s> in my mixed wireless/wired home network, i do utilize dhcp and static mapping with no issues, but i've seen some funny things happen when i tried static mapping with some home nat devices -- most likely because of misconfiguration.  </s>
<s> 4. are you able to ping your nat/router from your problem pc? 5. how did you configure dns server entries on your computers?  </s>
<s> are you letting your nat/router be the gateway to your isp's dns servers?  </s>
<s> if you are not able to ping even the nat/router but you are able to get dns resolutions then --- errrrr --- i have to think about that... but that'll be a nice bit of info to know.  </s>
<s> i don't ever check these forums, the only reason why i came across this post, is because this post somehow showed up as &quot;news&quot; on my google desktop... so ehrm... good luck!  </s>
<s> cm  </s>
<s> i tried using dhcp, but no difference.  </s>
<s> haven't tried removing the voip terminal.  </s>
<s> that's not really an option, but i guess it's a place to start.  </s>
<s> you write ... cable -&gt; cable modem -&gt; voip terminal -&gt; wireless router which could result in the voip grabbing your one and only ip address.  </s>
