<s> i have a 566mhz processor.  </s>
<s> ive tried to burn a dvd but holly it takes a like 18hours.  </s>
<s> and thats just a 1 gig of video.  </s>
<s> im guessing not even if i upgrade it wont make a difference.  </s>
<s> so my question is which comp or kind of computer can help to burn this kind of video.  </s>
<s> the actual recording time should be about the same with your cpu and some 2+ ghz cpu.  </s>
<s> what will change is the encoding time.  </s>
<s> it's very linear to cpu power.  </s>
<s> if you had a twice as fast cpu, it would take 1/2 as long.  </s>
<s> any under 1,000 buck desktop will do this much faster but none (at that price) will break it down in less than say, one hour.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yes!!! for example when i first got into video edditing and i would render a 10min video on my 500mhz pc, it would take 40min to complete!!!! now the same video will render on my 3200+ amd64 in about 6 min.  </s>
