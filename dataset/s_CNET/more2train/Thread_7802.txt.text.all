the error is called smapi rc = 97 and i find this out wen i falsly restart my pc. my pc will just freeze when the error occurs, and it occurs very reguarly. 
it says that a solution would be to restart the audio setup wizard, but i dont know how to? 
please help! 
you could uninstall via voice and move on, or the google was very interesting with notes from ibm about it.
