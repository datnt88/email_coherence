<s> what &quot;hub&quot; model number?  </s>
<s> wired or wireless network adapters?  </s>
<s> please elaborete on what &quot;i can't connect anymore&quot; means?  </s>
<s> anytime you use a hub to connect devices, each device connected to the hub diminishes the bandwidth from the source (in this case your internet connection coming from your pc).  </s>
<s> i would suggest you get a switch instead and plug all 8 machines into it along with the incoming internet connection.  </s>
<s> everytime something is plugged into a hub, it cuts the original bandwidth or transfer speed in half.  </s>
