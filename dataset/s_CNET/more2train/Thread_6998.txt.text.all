<s> hi just recently i purchased an hp media center m7160n and i was just wondering if it is possible to add a 2nd hard drive.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> take a look inside.  </s>
<s> if there's an extra bay, and there are two controller ports on the system board, go for it.  </s>
<s> and if there isn't a 3.5&quot; drive bay available for a second hdd, see if you have a 5.25&quot; drive bay available.  </s>
<s> you could put the 3.5&quot; hard drive in a 5.25&quot; bay (mounting kit required).  </s>
<s> much much better in my opinion to mount a second drive internally for backup and extra disk space....just read the messages about externals in the storage forum.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> be sure you new hd have to set as secondary slave...(jumpers on the back) if you have sata, dont needed too, just add power, and cable and let's ready to roll  </s>
<s> hi again thanks for the help so far it dosent appear that i have a second hard drive bay, i found that my hard drive is a maxtor 250gb serial ata.  </s>
<s> ifound the cable that goes from it to the mother board.  </s>
<s> when i looked on the mother board i found that there was 3 more of the same ports in different colours.  </s>
<s> what does this mean?  </s>
<s> also on the power cable that geos to the hard drive there is another cable coming from it that goes to the hp personal media drive.  </s>
<s> would i have to dissconect that to add a 2nd?  </s>
<s> when i looked for other free pwer cables i found a bunch of regular 4 pin cables.  </s>
<s> could i get an adapter for those?  </s>
<s> or would i need to buy another psu?  </s>
<s> so even if i could do all that and it worked were would i put i couldnt just lay it on the bottem of the case or could i? thank for the help so far, please respond with any info regarding this.  </s>
<s> connor  </s>
