<s> i have verizon fios, and a wireless modem/router that they've supplied.  </s>
<s> it is on the 2nd floor of my home.  </s>
<s> i have a device which has always had trouble with wireless connections (it is built in hardware i can't swap out).  </s>
<s> it does however have an ethernet port. is there a way to get a wireless router to receive the wireless signal from my fios modem/router?  </s>
<s> i would then hardwire the router to my device so that this device can finally get online.  </s>

<s> i've been using a wireless dsl modem for a few months. the computers connect to it directly, by wireless.  </s>
<s> i also have a cisco wireless/ethernet router, and have been wondering if i could get it back in the game by making a wireless connection between it and the dsl modem.  </s>
<s> any thoughts on that?  </s>
