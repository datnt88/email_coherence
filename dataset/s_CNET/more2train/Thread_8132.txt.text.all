<s> this is more of an annoyance rather than a problem.  </s>
<s> just recently when i start up xp windows checks the fat32 on my external drive for &quot;consistency&quot; as it puts it.  </s>
<s> i did it once, which took nearly 2-3 hours and it deleted some of my mp3 collection due to bad clusters or something to that effect.  </s>
<s> well, since then windows still wants to keep checking the fat32 on my external drive.  </s>
<s> i can skip this process, which i do, but i just would like to know why windows keeps on doing this.  </s>
<s> i of course can simply turn my hard drive, but i usually keep it on 24/7.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> that's my fix.  </s>
<s> while you're at it...turn it off when not in use.  </s>
<s> leaving it on 24-7 is sure way to bring on early and untimely demise.  </s>
<s> last....convert it to ntfs.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
