<s> i have a western digital &quot;my book essential edition&quot; external hard drive.  </s>
<s> when i plug it into a usb 2.0 port (i've tried it on numerous computers that have usb 2.0 ports), i get a message that says the drive will run faster if connected to a usb 2.0 port.  </s>
<s> if you use the hard drive, i have determined that it is operating rather slowly, as if its a 1.0 drive.  </s>
<s> its as if the usb port is not recognizing the drive as a usb 2.0 device.  </s>
<s> not sure what to do next as it does not appear that there is a new firmware download available and the unit is out of warranty.  </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> 1. the computers you plugged into don't have usb 2.0.  </s>

<s> add usb 2.0 cards.  </s>
<s> do not use front usb ports for these tests.  </s>
<s> 2. you are not using the usb cable that came with the drive.  </s>

<s> bob, thanks for your reply.  </s>
<s> both computers i have used do have usb 2.0 cards.  </s>
<s> i installed one of them (the device manager shows an enhanced controller for usb), and the other is a new computer that a friend of mine has and does operate as a 2.0 for other devices that he uses.  </s>
<s> i am using the cable that was sent with the hard drive so i'm still puzzled about this problem.  </s>
<s> larry  </s>
<s> i'd ask them to replace this unit.  </s>
