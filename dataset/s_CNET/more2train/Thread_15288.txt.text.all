<s> somewhere i think i heard it is just a software update?  </s>
<s> thank you, billy  </s>
<s> if there is a sofware update, you'll find it noted at but the only reason i think the urban legend lives on is that we all wish it was a pure software update.  </s>
<s> if you have a desktop, usb 2.0 cards start at under 10 bucks at newegg.com and compgeeks.com  </s>
<s> best of luck with that!  </s>

<s> this may be bad form to interject like this, but i am impressed w/your responses i've read (on numerous forums--don't you ever sleep?). you appear to know what you're talking about, you're concise, and able to keep it understandable.  </s>
<s> even i can understand most of your responses.  </s>
<s> while i don't imagine you're in it for the recognition, i think you deserve a &quot;thanks&quot; for services rendered.  </s>
<s> consider this one.  </s>
<s> i do sleep.  </s>
<s> and i use mozilla that helps automate loading up about 1/2 the forums with just 2 clicks.  </s>
<s> then it's a breeze to see what's up in the forums i read.  </s>
<s> i'm able to look around inbetween programming, design sessions and ... meetings.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> could anyone tell me what is involved in the upgrade.  </s>
<s> usb1 to usb2 the reason for upgrade is to allow me to transfer my old camcorder films to cd or dvd via &quot;dazzle digital video creator&quot; software which is still to be purchased.  </s>
<s> thank you ian  </s>
<s> you need to open your computer's case to find out if you have an empty pci slot.  </s>
<s> your usb 2.0 card will come in the form of a pci card that you insert into an unused pci slot in your computer's motherboard.  </s>
<s> after you insert the card, start up your computer.  </s>
<s> you need to install the software driver that came with the card.  </s>
<s> if the card came with no driver, windows will find your card and may try to install a software driver for you.  </s>
<s> if you need a driver, go to the card manufacturer's website and download a driver to install. the best thing to do is follow the instructions that come with your pci usb 2.0 card.  </s>
<s> even if you don't have an empty pci slot, you can get a usb 2.0 combo card.  </s>
<s> i think your computer has 3 pci slots.  </s>
<s> if they are all filled and one of them has, say, a pci network interface card in it, you can replace your pci network interface card with a combo card that has usb 2.0 ports and a network cable port.  </s>
<s> also, if you like to plug devices into the front of your computer instead of the back, get a card with an internal usb 2.0 port on it.  </s>
<s> this will allow you to run a usb 2.0 connection to the front of your computer with ease.  </s>
<s> i see you use a camcorder.  </s>
<s> if you purchase a new camcorder, it will likely have use a firewire (ieee 1394) output to make a direct connection to your computer.  </s>
<s> so you might want to consider a ''pci usb 2.0 and ieee 1394 combo card'' with internal usb and firewire ports.  </s>
<s> as an example, the following card has three external usb 2.0 and one internal.  </s>
<s> it also has two external ieee 1394 and one internal:  </s>
<s> i am so sorry... thanks so much for your note.  </s>
<s> now if... i could just cut back on the meetings....  </s>
<s> thank you very much for the information ian  </s>
