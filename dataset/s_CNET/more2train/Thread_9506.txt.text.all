my brother has the only computer connected to the internet in the house and refuses to let us set up a home network because he's paranoid. is there any way to hook up both a wireless router and his computer to the cable modem seperately? 
i'd hate to have to get a whole seperate cable hookup. 
some modems have the standard ethernet connection and a usb connection. 
some allow both to be used at the same time, some don't. 
you'll just have to investigate the modems available to you. 
if a modem will allow both connections, connect his using the usb port, and then connect a router using the ethernet port for the other pcs. 
i think i'd have a heart to heart with my brother. 
just don't set up sharing and have him use a strong password on his system but if he is that paranoid, personally, i'd get my own hook up and even use a different server. 
i had a friend some time back with a similar issue and eventually that is what happened, separate hook ups and different service providers, what a nightmare that was!
