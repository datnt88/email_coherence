<s> are there any changes for the macbook with the release of leopard?  </s>
<s> reply hazy, try again.  </s>
<s> which makes me think... is there a magic 8 ball widget for my dashboard?  </s>
<s> it wouldn't surprise me to see the steve come out with new specs for a computer but i have no news to relate about it yet.  </s>
<s> try checking out the leo laporte radio show rebroadcasted on twit.tv... he has a prety good ear for tech gossip.  </s>
<s> grim  </s>
<s> but if you're asking if you'll need to upgrade your macbook to run leopard, other than maxing out on ram, the answer is likely no. while windows machines are usually seen as lacking or requiring a hardware rebuild with a new os, as long as your mac is running the processor de jour, i.e. intel, you'll likely be able to function with the newest mac os for years to come.  </s>
<s> my bet is that they will likely support the g4/g5 processors for a good bit longer.  </s>
<s> my employer still has us all using os 9 (yikes!) and is only now considering moving us all to os x since we can no longer get copies of quark 4.1.  </s>
<s> the twit network has several good netcasts about current tech gear and tech news; some general, some specifically about the mac.  </s>
<s> while you should have no problem upgrading to tiger if you're running a macbook, there may be some updates released for the currently sold hardware sometime soon.  </s>
