hi all i have a little problem regarding power supply on my pc - intel core quad 2 3k ghz - p7p55 - ws - supercomp - 8 gb ddr 3 2k mhz - wd 300 gb 10k rpm so the question is can a 550 w power supply handle this? 
any tips would be appreciated tnx 
such as and since there is no 3d card in that list, sounds good enough.

i checked one gtx 285 card and it requires: 575w pci express-compliant system power supply with a combined 12v current rating of 42a or more_fragments more_threads two 6-pin pci express supplementary power connectors -or- one 6-pin pci express and two 4-pin peripheral supplementary power connectors note: for the power requirements of multiple geforce gtx 285-based graphics cards in an nvidia sli configuration, please visit *minimum system power requirement based on a pc configured with an intel core i7 965 extreme edition processor bottom line you need to pick a card, get the specific specs and pick a good quality psu ....maybe a 700 or 750w psu. it pays to have the head room and an efficient psu. 
here's one.... 750w by corsair $99.00 after rebate vapcmd 
vapcmd ty for ur answer but looks like the processor is not compatible with the mb so i had to make some changes i will go for a corsair cmpsu-450hx 450w tnx for ur time this topic can be closed now :p
