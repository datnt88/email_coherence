<s> the problem started sometime ago.  </s>
<s> when i turn on my pc, i hear 3 beeps and then everything goes dead!  </s>
<s> i thought it was a hardware problem so after experimenting i got the pc to work by removing ram, turning on pc, let it display a memory missing screen, turn off without saving configuration, reinsert ram and turn on pc. the boot up takes atleast 1 min while the welcome screen takes ages to appear and once it is there, it displays &quot;windows is starting up&quot;, the logon takes a year and then another for loading the startup apps.  </s>
