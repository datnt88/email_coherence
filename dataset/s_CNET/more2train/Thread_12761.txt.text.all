<s> hi, is anyone using credant/mcafee/winmagic/cososys for mac in order to encrypt usb devices?  </s>
<s> i'm trying to find the best solution for encrypting devices and have many questions about the whole thing... thanks!  </s>
<s> which discussion should we use?  </s>
<s> i know the easylock solution from my officer where we have to use with usbs on windows to encrypt data but it also works in the same way on mac.  </s>
<s> i also use it at home (mac only) and cannot say how simple it is.  </s>
<s> haven't even considered trying another usb encryption tool.  </s>
<s> i have to agree with carl.  </s>
<s> since i've lost a usb stick with some personal stuff, i decided not to use this type of tiny device without encryption ever again.  </s>
<s> easylock is the easiest tool i found.  </s>
<s> i'm telling you...you just have to drag and drop the files in the encrypted side, and it's all done.  </s>
<s> does easylock encrypts the entire drive (like a zip file or something) or each file?  </s>
<s> (trying to understand can i have an encrypted and non-encrypted folders on the same device?) thanks!  </s>
<s> i use easylock like you say, with easylock all files go in a folder but are separately encrypted so not like a zip.  </s>
<s> and i keep some files also unencrypted on the device.  </s>
<s> thanks a lot for your answers guys!  </s>
<s> still will be happy to hear about the solutions of credant / mcafee / winmagic if anyone had tried those...? thanks!  </s>
