hi i have partitioned my macbook hard drive to run windows as well (using bootcamp) i have come to realize that i did not put enough space for my windows hard drive. 
is it possible to add space to it now or is it to late? 
i believe there is an option to change the partition size p 
take a look at a piece of software called camptune. 
it claims to be able to modify the boot camp partition size p
