<s> 1. a cd/dvd lens cleaner.  </s>
<s> 2. another drive.  </s>
<s> i haven't tried another drive, that's a good idea.  </s>
<s> however, buying a lens cleaner would be another $15 or so, the drive cost $20 so i'm not too sure about that.  </s>
<s> i was hoping for a reply similar to the way in which other errors are fixed.  </s>
<s> a simple search for the unknown error (4280) gives a step-by-step solution that has to do with the settings of the drive.  </s>
<s> and it's amazing that a new drive rivals the cost of the lens cleaner.  </s>
