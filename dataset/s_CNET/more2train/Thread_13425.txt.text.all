<s> i have an imac g5, 17&quot; /w os x 10.3.8, 1.8 ghz super drive, 512mb, ...purchased in 05 and apple replaced the hard drive and logic something a few months later and now it is a 10.3.9 and still a &quot;lemon&quot;.always  </s>
<s> slow and get the dreaded rainbow wheel a lot.  </s>
<s> now, i am unable to boot to desktop(again) but i do not want to erase my pictures and videos in order to do a restart/recovery as had done before.. how do i retrieve my info if the computer will not boot?  </s>
<s> if i remove the hard drive, can i take it somewhere to retrieve the pictures?  </s>
<s> i just purchased a &quot;my book&quot; external hard drive and did not get to use it because of my os x problem.  </s>
<s> i have an e-machine with windows xp, and a hp with windows 2000, but they won't be of any help?  </s>
<s> i also tried everything suggested in &quot;the missing manual&quot;.  </s>
<s> i had this problem before and apple had us erase all of our stuff. it was okay then because i did not have my pictures and videos.  </s>
<s> i also have a lot of music i would like to keep. the pictures are the most important.  </s>
<s> no backup of any kind was done because we had just recently added the pictures and videos.  </s>
<s> thanks, sue ps:i still consider myself a computer newbie especially with the mac.  </s>
<s> machines don't last forever but 3 years is a little short unless it's one of those used daily machines.  </s>
<s> i find our work laptops start to have severe issues after year 2. bob  </s>
<s> the first thing to find out is whether or not the imac will start up from the restore cd/dvd you were not very specific about what happens when you attempt to start the imac.  </s>
<s> does it chime?  </s>
<s> does the screen light up?  </s>
<s> do you see the grey apple and spinning spokes?  </s>
<s> a folder icon with a question mark?  </s>
<s> does any happen at all?  </s>
<s> if the imac starts from the recovery cd/dvd, it is a good indication that most of the internal stuff is working as designed.  </s>
<s> the next thing is to find out if the hard drive is still functioning.  </s>
<s> if it is, then you have a good chance of recovering all your data.  </s>
<s> if it is not, then i'm afraid your data will only be recoverable using a professional data recovery service.  </s>
<s> if the imac booted from the cd/dvd, use the disk utility from the menu bar and see if it recognizes the hard drive.  </s>
<s> if it does, run first aid on it to see if it is damaged in any way.  </s>
<s> if it appears ok, quit disk utility.  </s>
<s> start the install process but choose archive and install as the installation method.  </s>
<s> choose only the archive and install option.  </s>
<s> you will find it under options at the first or second screen of the installer.  </s>
<s> this will lay down a new system folder, but will preserve all your data.  </s>
<s> once the recovery is complete, and the machine restarts, all your data will be where you left it.  </s>
<s> now make the backup of all your data!  </s>
<s> i will not beat the drum about regular backups, i guess you have already become a convert to that regime.  </s>
<s> daily backups are not too often.  </s>
<s> all the above relies on the hd being functional.  </s>
<s> pass on more information and we'll go from there good luck p  </s>
<s> the comp.  </s>
<s> only shows the flashing ?  </s>
<s> and does nothing else.  </s>
<s> however, when the disc install. is in, the computer chimes, the apple and spinning wheel are there and it goes to the install screen.  </s>
<s> this is the only way i can do anything.  </s>
<s> i went to disc utility, did the first aid and it says disc is ok. i even tried to use the archive and install option, but the computer froze.  </s>
<s> when i tried it again, the archive option was no longer available, only install for first time or erase and install.  </s>
<s> when in disc utility, i went to the &quot;restore&quot; option...once in there i went to screen and was able to find my photos, but was unable to click on any of them.  </s>
<s> they were not in bold print, but they are still there.  </s>
<s> how can i get them?  </s>
<s> that hard drive does not sound healthy.  </s>
<s> if the a & i option was there first, but has since disappeared, it is a reasonable sign that the drive is defective. the flashing question mark means that the system cannot find a viable system folder from which to boot the machine.  </s>
<s> the &quot;restore&quot; function in disk utility does not do what it sounds like it would do.  </s>
<s> it is for restoring a disk from a disk image, which you do not have, and will do nothing for you.  </s>
<s> you would be well advised to leave the disk alone and contact a data recovery service.  </s>
<s> they are not cheap.  </s>
<s> only you can make the determination as to whether your data is worth the price that they charge.  </s>
<s> google for &quot;data recovery&quot; and you will find lots of hits.  </s>
<s> you don't have to specify mac or windows, they do any platform.  </s>
<s> sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but when a drive appears and disappears, it is not a good sign.  </s>
