<s> i was wondering if anyone could tell me how much of a performance gap there is between the t7200 (2ghz, 4mb l2 cache, 667mhz fsb) and the t5600 (1.83ghz, 2mb l2 cache, 667mhz fsb).  </s>
<s> how noticable would the difference be in gaming and application performance?  </s>
<s> i'm thinking of getting a dell inspiron 1505 and am debating whether or not to spend the extra cash ($75) to get the upgraded processor (i've already put all the other highest end components available on it).  </s>
<s> ^its an e1505  </s>
<s> 10% clock boost and 3-4% boost for the added cache.  </s>
<s> do you think this boost in performance justifies an additional $75? will the increase be noticable in gaming?  </s>
<s> but for gaming, the next higher video card will always give you a bigger performance boost.  </s>
<s> so if $75 buys a better video card, then that's where you should spend your cash.  </s>
<s> i would...but the e1505 only offers the ati mobility radeon x1400 and the nvidia geforce go 7300.  </s>
<s> although the nvidia costs $30 more in the config, i've read and seen benchmark scores that support the ati being the better gpu.  </s>
<s> i've also since read educated opinions that suggest the 2ghz processor will have a very minimal effect on gaming, especially considering i can only put a middle of the road gpu in.  </s>
