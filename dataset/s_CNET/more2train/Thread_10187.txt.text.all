i tried to update an asus bios (k8vsedx) as i was having some operating issues. 
the upgrade seemed to be successful, but now the computer is dead. 
it provides no signal to the monitor so i can't boot from a floppy or cd. any thoughts would be most appreciated. 
offer you the option of making a backup of your original bios information (and it puts it onto the floppy disk you used to flash with)....can you boot up with that disk and restore the original?

resetting the cmos to see if it is a total loss. 
usually jumper pin # 1 or 2 on the motherboard although some vary.
