<s> hi guys, i hope i am in the right place.  </s>
<s> i am plannign on building a new computer.  </s>
<s> i did it several years ago and then went to buying the dells.  </s>
<s> currently i have a dell 4600.  </s>
<s> it just does not do the trick anymore.  </s>
<s> i want to build a really decent machine.  </s>
<s> i prefer intel chips but i could be swayed.  </s>
<s> i currently have an ati 9600 agp video card which is good enough for now.  </s>
<s> it would be great if i can use my existing memory but i am okay if i can't.  </s>
<s> so here is the questions which mb shoudl i buy which processor chip should i buy case?  </s>
<s> currently i am fine wiht my hd's just want to know what i should be looking for.  </s>
<s> i would like to keep the system under $1,000 being that i have the video card, hd's and possibly some memory i don't thik it should be that hard.  </s>
<s> please let me know what i shoudl buy.  </s>
<s> i try and keep my machines for abour 3 years.  </s>
<s> i want this to be totally compatible with vista and run fast as well.  </s>
<s> please help.  </s>
<s> i am assuming i am going to get a 64 bit processor.  </s>
<s> do i need to use xp 64 bit (i have it) if i do, are some of my components not compatible?  </s>
<s> or.. do i need to go with a duel boot?  </s>
<s> not much of a use...wait till vista... dont think u can dual boot 2 versions of xp u will need a motherboard.  </s>
<s> list the specs of your current computer...such as ram specs?  </s>
<s> motherboard?  </s>
<s> processor?  </s>
<s> etc. processor...right now i would go with an amd athlon x2 3800+.  </s>
<s> amd outperforms intel and runs cooler.  </s>
<s> ram...dpeending on whether u can salvage case: your choice... powersupply- i would recommend antec, seasonic, enermax, pc power and cooling, has to be at least 400-450watts optical drives- dvd burner?  </s>
<s> and for the graphics card?  </s>
<s> i dont think it is that good...and considering the prices of graphics cards have dropped so much.... i would recommend the 6800gs which can be had for about $160.  </s>
<s> if u want to spend like 100-150 more...get the newer 7900gt.  </s>
<s> but both are way faster than the 9600 u use.  </s>
<s> with a better graphics card, you can play newer games or older games at higher resoultions and settings and have much better visual quality.  </s>
<s> and keyboard, mouse, speakers, and monitor  </s>
<s> a link  </s>
<s> there are many threads about people with athlon x2's having weird problems while playing games.  </s>
<s> in a few years, all games will be designed for dual cores, but in the meantime...  </s>
<s> okay so here is where i am so far i just got the mb and processor any comments?  </s>
<s> thank you for all of your responses.  </s>
<s> so far here is where i am at with this: processor amd athlon 64 x2 3800+ manchester 1ghz ht 2 x 512kb l2 cache socket 939 dual core processor cost $295 motherboard asus a8r32 cost $209 before i go any furthur am i heading on the right track?  </s>
<s> just a tip.  </s>
<s> don't buy your computer yet.  </s>
<s> wait until the neew amd processors com out so that the price of the amd athlon x2 3800+ goes down. the same with the motherboard.  </s>
<s> i also recommend the asus a8n-sli deluxe.  </s>
<s> its not a new mb but it has won a lot of awards.  </s>
<s> &gt; i think i may go with the asrock 939dual-sata2 atx.  </s>
<s> this mb has a agp slot as well as a pci express slot.  </s>
<s> so i can use my old agp video card which is still a very powerful card.  </s>
<s> wait for amd socket am2. it supports ddr2 memory which is better than ddr. it will also work with vista like the other 64bit cpus.  </s>
