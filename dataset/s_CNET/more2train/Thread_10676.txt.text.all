<s> i have to ask this.  </s>
<s> considering the size and dimensions of the ipad, is a rear camera really needed?  </s>
<s> i mean, i can see a camera mounted facing the user, this has a place, it can be a web-cam for video chat, skype, etc. but a back-mounted camera is kinda pointless.  </s>
<s> i would be like a hard-back book doubling as a camera..why??? i can't imagine (actually sadly enough i can imagine) people using this book sized thing as a camera, would look [and mostly like be] the most awkward sized and silly to use camera in the world?  </s>
<s> i do realize cnet is chock-full of apple fan-boys so i would love to hear other takes / opinions on the subject.  </s>
<s> i think i see another solution.  </s>
<s> look up cameraa and camerab in the app store.  </s>
<s> what you find is that some think that because a product isn't just right for them it is no good.  </s>
<s> read goldilocks and the three bears lately?  </s>
<s> this goldilocks syndrome is best ignored and we can move to finding what &quot;this one is just right.&quot;  </s>

<s> actually i just watched tom merritt talk about this app that led to my posting this question (something that has been bugging me since people have been bringing up having a camera for the ipad and stating that this is a bad thing on the part of apple for not including it).  </s>
<s> i am not looking for a app that does this.  </s>
<s> i am asking why would you want to do this using the ipad (it's dimensions make it impractical to use as a camera)?  </s>
<s> i stated my logic for this question is the previous posting.  </s>
<s> i am really curious for the reasoning people have for wanting a camera for the ipad (i mean a camera in the back of the device, not a web-cam [like i said earlier that makes sense]).  </s>
<s> i did miss your point.  </s>
<s> or maybe i didn't.  </s>
<s> not every product is suited for each person.  </s>
<s> let's say they did what you wanted.  </s>
<s> now the next person comes along (just like goldilocks) and doesn't like it.  </s>
<s> choice is good.  </s>
<s> let the market decide.  </s>
<s> make yours?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> ok, while i do not see ipad sales slipping because they included a device that does not get used very often (or at all considering the alternative devices out there), i do see your point about letting the sales numbers speak for themselves.  </s>
<s> i agree that a webcam on the back of an ipad doesn't sound ergonomically useful.  </s>
<s> however if you could plug in an external webcam and point it to the professor during class you could record the lecture and see the screen.  </s>
<s> and when you want to skype you could point the external webcam toward you.  </s>
<s> yes, i second that idea.  </s>
<s> my idea is an external camera that has no cable just a dock connector and a swivel head so it can face forwards or backwards, or any way you want it to face. the camera would be very compact.  </s>
<s> since the ipad can be used in any orientation you the user could turn it upside down and have the camera on the topside.  </s>
<s> although, one could use the camera in landscape orientation if wanted.  </s>
<s> this would make the camera very compact to carry around.  </s>
<s> i would buy one as soon as one is created.  </s>
<s> how about you?  </s>
<s> i have the ipad 3g and this is the perfect device for skyping.  </s>
<s> i think just for video conferencing a built in camera would be a cleaner looking feature and one would not have to carry around an added device.  </s>
<s> since one is not included an external camera as described above would be nice.  </s>
