<s> i've found a barebone system with every thing i want, but hesitant about the harddrive bundled.  </s>
<s> it's a 120 gig iede maxtor ultra ata 133, but only 5400 rpm and &lt;13 average seek time.  </s>
<s> since i am upgrading equipment (p4 3.0 mhz, 512mb pc3200 ddr 400mhz) to speed things up; is this drive considered &quot;old stuff&quot;.  </s>
<s> or does ist matter.  </s>
<s> i read a report a while back where someone had done a test of 5400 vs 7200.  </s>
<s> in their test they did not see much of a diff.  </s>
<s> yes 7200 was slightly better.  </s>
<s> where they did see a big diff was in cache size.  </s>
<s> bigger is better.  </s>
<s> so if your looking to squeeze out all the juice get a 7200 unit with the biggest cache you can find/afford  </s>
<s> but you may never notice the difference between it, and a newer 7200 drive.  </s>
<s> however, if you are upgrading things, may consider getting a new 7200 drive.  </s>
<s> and using the old drive for a backup.  </s>
<s> just a thought, as the 5400 drive will probably serve you well.  </s>
<s> thanks guys.  </s>
<s> i may unload the unboxed drive on ebay, and go for a newer one to put in this barebone kit rob  </s>
<s> there is a significant and immediately noticeable difference between a 5400rpm drive and a 7200rpm drive.  </s>
<s> you don't even want to consider the slower drive in anything but a laptop.  </s>
<s> i have upgraded many in the past and in every case the owner immediately noticed their system was quite a bit faster.  </s>
<s> particularly with everything else you're getting for your system. the hard drive is about the slowest thing in a computer.  </s>
<s> so the faster it is the faster the entire system is.  </s>
