<s> i have a 256 mb of pci video card inside my computer and it works fine.  </s>
<s> i wanted to know if my computer can go up to 512 mb. can my computer can go up to at least 512 mb of a video card?  </s>
<s> i read to pick a price and then the card... since the card holds that ram, the video card sets the limit, not the pc.  </s>
<s> so basically my motherboard can handle at least 512 mb of the video?  </s>
<s> sorry if i was unclear. the motherboard holds the video card. the video card holds the video ram.  </s>
<s> so only the video card sets the limit.  </s>
