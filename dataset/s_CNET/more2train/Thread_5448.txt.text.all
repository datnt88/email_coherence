i have an old computer with no usb, just a parallel port. 
can anyone recommend an ink jet printer that still uses parallel ports--and can be run with windows 98? many thanks 
sadly, what is at the local stores here may not be in your country or town. 
i do see such at the local stores so it may be time to go shopping.

most newer and definelty cheaper end model don't have lpt ports, just usb. 
you really need to check the specs on anything that interests you. 
however, if you find no such creature, try adding a usb pci card, that will allow use of newer printers. 
just be sure to request one that supports usb2.0 vs 1, but it should anyways for most newer usb cards, just ask. 
to check specs on ainkjet model, visit the makers support website for info/details that refelect your model. 
it seems only laserjets come with any ports to attach as it were.
