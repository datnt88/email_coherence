i swapped the pcb board on crashed hard drive (wd200eb-00csf0)with one i purchased off of the internet. 
the drive now spins and shows up in the device manager but does not show under my computer. 
os windows 2000 pro. 
i would hope there is a way to recover my lost files. 
use the top post in this forum for the usuals. 
hint: the lost and found post. 
if that fails, you are left to call up the folks at: bob 
use your hard disk as slave drive with other system and copy your data.for 
lost files many data recovery software available on internet.
