does anyone know if it's possible to suppress a mouse cursor if a remote network access app like tight vnc was in use? 
this seems like a lethal way of invading a networks desktops. 
i did this once for a demo. the vnc client (that's the one doing the remote control) didn't have a mouse installed.

okay then, with regards to security concerns. 
how would a user (either network administrator or end user) actually know that they're being hacked this way? 
i still used the keyboard to start programs and such. 
it looks like a ghost operating the machine. 
and it would be obvious... bob
