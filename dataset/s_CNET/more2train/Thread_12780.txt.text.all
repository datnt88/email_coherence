please help and thank's 
did you check to see if your dvd hardware is video or audio dvd?if you have an audio dvd player...then you wont be able to use video dvd disc. 
did it ever work. 
what brand/model dvd drive is it? 
are the commercial dvd's you are trying to play or dvd's someone made? 
sony players have serious problems with some media, though all commercial media should work.
