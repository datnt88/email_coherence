i have a hp 2200 set up on my network, and for some reason after a job is printed, it still remains in the queue labled as printed. 
after a while it starts to print the old documents over and over again. 
can someone please help thanks 
but notice what's missing in your post? 
i'm using windows 2000 
windows 2000 is up to at least service pack 4. also missing is what printer driver version you used. 
if it came off a cd, it's likely out of date.
