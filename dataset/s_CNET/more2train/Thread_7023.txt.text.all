i left my laptop computer on for a couple days, never installed or uninstalled anything in that time, &amp; when i came back, avast detected a threat, and i now i keep getting this little pop up telling me &quot;can't load res_dll&quot;. 
i try to exit out of the little box &amp; it pops right back up in a matter of seconds. 
after searching a little on this error message, i see that it could be related to the linksys wireless router that i have. 
it's what i connect to the internet with, but i have never updated, downloaded, or changed anything about it so i don't know how this is happening now. 
i'm seeing that i need to uninstall the driver using the disk, then re-install using the website. the problem with that is, someone gave me this router to connect to the internet, they never gave me a disk. is there any way i can remove/re-install without the disk? 
how can i fix this problem? 
and i'm afraid that if i start uninstalling stuff for the wireless router, that i wont be connected to the internet anymore, thus not allowing me to even go and get the drivers off the website. 
and i have the model number for the router, but i have no idea what series it is. 
model # wusb54gc 
all the laptops i know of save those new ones have an ethernet port for when the wifi is down. 
why won't we use that?
