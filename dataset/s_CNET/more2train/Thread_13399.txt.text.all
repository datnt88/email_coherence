<s> hello! i have a 2ghz celeron, xp, and an audigy sound card... now for some reason, its making a popping sound whenever i try to play a cd or a dvd, yet a mere 3 weeks ago, when i installed the card, it was playing back perfectly fine.  </s>
<s> all other sound is fine, it only 'pops' when i have a cd/dvd in the drive, so i know theres nothing wrong with the speakers.  </s>
<s> i was wondering if any of you nice clever people knew what i have to change/hit hard, to sort my problem out!? greatly appreciated!!!  </s>
<s> 1. system restore to when it worked proper.  </s>
<s> 2. move the sound card to another slot.  </s>
<s> 3. pass all scans i note and be free of all pests with the anti-parasite suite i listed at 4. before above, try a headset or other speakers to make sure the amplified speakers are not the cause.  </s>
