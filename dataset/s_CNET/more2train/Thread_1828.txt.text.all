<s> can i connect two pcs on lan using just a lan cord?  </s>
<s> the 8 wires in the cord have some extra wires.  </s>
<s> you could split the pairs at both ends of a single cord to connect to 2 ports of a router, then that single cord can run to your pcs and split again to the 2 pcs.  </s>
<s> but that's a lot of wiring just to avoid running a second cable.  </s>

<s> okay ignore him, the answer, yes, just make sure its a crossover network cable, just go in2 ur local place where u buy cables (i have no idea of store names in america) ask 4 a cross over cable, buy it, and plug it in2 the backs of ur 2 computers, no splicing or rewiring of cables required, i have no idea where this guy got that idea :s  </s>
