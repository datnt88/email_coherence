i am thoroughly confused. 
i have a desktop running vista, 2 laptops running windows 7 and a laptop running xp. i had a home network where we could all share files and printers using my linksys router. 
i had to purchase a new router yesterday and now the windows 7 laptops are not accessible from my vista desktop. the xp is accessible, but when i try to view files in the windows 7 laptops it tells me &quot;windows cannot access this xxxxxx.&quot; 
i called netgear for help since it is brand new but they will not help unless i purchase a extended contract. 
i just found out our wii will not connect either. 
the new router has that new firewall. 
did you configure that to allow shares? 
i am on my log in and their help page about firewalls and do not see my firewall setting. 
i see netgear but can't find the model. 
many had firewalls and &quot;client isolation.&quot; 
as i can't find the model, my guess may be a bad one.
