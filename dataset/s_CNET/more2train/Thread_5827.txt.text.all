<s> i am thoroughly confused.  </s>
<s> i have a desktop running vista, 2 laptops running windows 7 and a laptop running xp. i had a home network where we could all share files and printers using my linksys router.  </s>
<s> i had to purchase a new router yesterday and now the windows 7 laptops are not accessible from my vista desktop. the xp is accessible, but when i try to view files in the windows 7 laptops it tells me &quot;windows cannot access this xxxxxx.&quot;  </s>
<s> i called netgear for help since it is brand new but they will not help unless i purchase a extended contract.  </s>
<s> i just found out our wii will not connect either.  </s>
<s> the new router has that new firewall.  </s>
<s> did you configure that to allow shares?  </s>
<s> i am on my log in and their help page about firewalls and do not see my firewall setting.  </s>
<s> i see netgear but can't find the model.  </s>
<s> many had firewalls and &quot;client isolation.&quot;  </s>
<s> as i can't find the model, my guess may be a bad one.  </s>
