<s> im going to buy a new lcd flat panel monitor but wasnt sure about the sizes.  </s>
<s> i was under the impression that the size (example 17&quot;) is different from the viewing size....is this correct?....my current crt monitor is a 17&quot; and id like one the same or roughly the same size.  </s>
<s> id really appreciate anyone helping me out with this! thanks alot guys!  </s>

<s> lcd and it went south after 3years of hard use.  </s>
<s> but it was about the same viewing size as this 17&quot; crt.  </s>
<s> so if youi get a 17&quot; lcd youi will seem to have more screen, as well as less eye strain.  </s>
<s> your 17&quot; crt is probably 16&quot; (diagonal measurement) in reality.  </s>
<s> a 17&quot; lcd will be just that...17&quot; diagonal.  </s>
<s> there are some with slightly different aspect ratios out there that dont follow the normal 4x3 convention.  </s>
<s> you can tell this by their published &quot;native resolution&quot; by doing a little math.  </s>
<s> this just changes the relative width and highth of the images.  </s>
<s> also, the native resolution will be the only one that gives the monitors best image.  </s>
<s> the resolution you like best on your current monitor might not be the optimum for a crt of equivant size.  </s>
<s> this may mean you accept some image degradation or go with the native resolution and get used to a change in icon and page sizes.  </s>
<s> thanks guys!  </s>
<s> thats helped alot....i think i know what i want now....thanks again frank  </s>
<s> crt's are measured from one top corner to the opposing bottom corner of the picture tube in a diagonal fashion.  </s>
<s> you often hear the term &quot;viewable size&quot; and this refers to the amount of the tube not covered by the shroud or bezzel.  </s>
<s> lcd screens are what you see is what you get though i think they are still measured from top corner to opposing bottom corner.  </s>
<s> at any rate a 17&quot; lcd will usually have a larger screen than a crt simply because none of the lcd screen will be covered by a shroud or bezzel.  </s>
<s> one interesting thing i've noticed is that even though an lcd has a bigger screen it looks like it is smaller simply because of the smaller footprint of the monitor.  </s>
<s> it sort of fools the brain because of the small package that contains the big screen.  </s>
<s> we're all used to seeing 20&quot; deep and wide monitors and now they are only a few inches deep.  </s>
