<s> i just built this computer.  </s>
<s> specs are below: amd athlon 64 3000+ socket 939 msi neo2 platinum socket 939 corsair xms twinx 2x512 ddr400 1024c2pt leadtek gefore 6800 gt tdh a400 gt lite on cd-rw + dvd-rom mitsumi floppy hitachi desktar 60gb hard drive ata100 all up to date drivers + bios ver 1.41 windows xp professional with all updates inc sp2 the computer runs and boots fine.  </s>
<s> however, if left unattended, it will sometimes freeze.  </s>
<s> sometimes it will freeze when you use it but not as often as when left unattended.  </s>
<s> also, when i load the corecenter and digicell programs from msi, the computer freezes upon booting when the program auto starts up everytime.  </s>
<s> so i removed those and the computer just locks up like usual, unattended.  </s>
<s> also, sometimes the computer will run lockup free for like a week.  </s>
<s> then one day, like over night, i will leave it on and i wake up the next morning and its frozen.  </s>
<s> also, sometimes if it is frozen, the computer will still be running, like the clock, but the mouse and keyboard don't respond.  </s>
<s> if i hold in the power button to shut it off, the computer will go into the shutdown process, then freeze there once it says windows is shutting down.  </s>
<s> this computer is like i said brand new.  </s>
<s> only a couple weeks old.  </s>
<s> i built the computer, and no i am not a person who thought they could put together a person without knowing much about computers.  </s>
<s> i have built several.  </s>
<s> i e-mailed msi and they told me to try swapping out the memory.  </s>
<s> so i just did that like 5 minutes ago and i will see what the results are  </s>
<s> do you have a 450 of larger power supply?  </s>
<s> is it on an uninterruptable power supply (ups)?  </s>
<s> if it is not on an ups, then a minor ac dip can cause an issue.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i have a fortron 400w power supply.  </s>
<s> no, the computer is not hooked to a backup ups.  </s>
<s> a ups shouldnt make a difference.  </s>
<s> without an ups, a few cycles could go missing and the machine will lock up.  </s>
<s> your selection of the power supply is &quot;light&quot;.  </s>
<s> sadly, the tone of your post is &quot;it can't be that&quot;.  </s>
<s> what has to happen is you need to collect more responses and decide what you wish to do about this.  </s>
<s> denial is not going to help you here.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> would a bad ac line make sense if my previous computer worked fine on as well as the rest of the components on it ?  </s>
<s> how is the power supply choice &quot;light&quot;.  </s>
<s> many reviews scored the power supply high reliability and overall output, especially in the voltage ranges used for an amd processor.  </s>
<s> the power supply helps ride out a few missing ac cycles.  </s>
<s> and we always fit the ups when people complain of overnight lockups.  </s>
<s> it's a too-high percentage of cures so i write with certainty on that issue.  </s>
<s> hope you find it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> it just produces a bad image.  </s>
<s> thats like saying, in order for your computer to run stable, you must hook up a ups.  </s>
<s> i guess i am a little confused on how that could be the problem.  </s>
<s> it's just one of the issues that is notable.  </s>
<s> having a just big enough supply as well as one that is over a year old doesn't let it ride out any ac power interuptions.  </s>
<s> how about this.  </s>
<s> have you contacted the place that sold you these parts?  </s>
<s> what do they suggest to do next?  </s>
<s> all the usual other items are.. 1. latest bios.  </s>
<s> 2. bios defaults.  </s>
<s> 3. only the ram they suggest.  </s>
<s> 4. case cover off.  </s>
<s> 5. rma it part by part until you find the bad part.  </s>
<s> 6. recycled parts are suspect.  </s>
<s> remove them too.  </s>
