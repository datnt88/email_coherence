is the asus transformer prime shipping with ics pre-installed or do you still have to upgrade if i went out and bought it today. 
thanks 
if the seller or asus will not answer a pre-sales question you should not buy from them. 
this is never an acceptable behavior and means that when you need support, it's probably going to be non-existent.

i bought it at best buy. 
ics downloaded a couple of days later.
