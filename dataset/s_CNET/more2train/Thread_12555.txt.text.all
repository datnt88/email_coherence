<s> i have a five year old medeon computer with p4 2.2ghz, 250w power supply.  </s>
<s> the fan on the video card is making all kinds of noise and rather than replace the whole computer, i'd rather find a good replacement for the video card; however, i'm not find any replacements when i google it.  </s>
<s> does anyone know of where to find these older generation cards and maybe even an upgrade to the one i have.  </s>
<s> any agp based video card out there if new is going to be better than what you have now.  </s>
<s> that's good news provided as you already know can find one.  </s>
<s> thus, it will be an upgraded version quite capable.  </s>
<s> start at these vendors, and google others.  </s>
<s> you can use the web search engines under google, etc. by narrowing it down via the price searchers, like newtag and shopzilla, etc.. of course, there is ebay, just be sure to check their reviews or credentials.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> they also make this card without a fan.  </s>
<s> see here: looking for older video cards is easy on ebay, if you do not mind reading through all the postings to find what you want.  </s>
<s> 1. replace the fan.  </s>
<s> i used this with a little work to drill the holes to match my old card -&gt; 2. shop for the fx6200 or fx7200 card for the slot type you have. the power requirement for this card is on the low side.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i should have mentioned, if your video card fan is the typical square looking type, its possible to replace.  </s>
<s> your fan size maybe 40mm or 50mm and radiosmack does have new ones for sale.  </s>
<s> provided you can remove the fan, thus replace to include any wire splicing, yada, yada.  </s>
<s> if removable, take to radiosmack or a decent local computer shop for the replacement match-up.  </s>
<s> far cheaper than another video card.  </s>
<s> good luck -----willy  </s>
