<s> i just bought a cd rw external drive to back up my files.  </s>
<s> it also comes with an audio cable to plug into my computer (a left-right plug for the external drive's output that converges to a single jack for inputting into the pc's sound card).  </s>
<s> my dumb question is which of the 3 slots on the sound card does the single plug go into?  </s>
<s> there is a speaker plug, a mic plug and a line out plug.  </s>
<s> i doubt it goes into the mic plug but i can see either of the others being appropriate.  </s>
<s> this is not a big deal as my pc has a read-only drive that works just fine and i don't currently need to use the external drive for playing anything, but i'd still like to know (and the direction book fails to tell me).  </s>
<s> seems odd.  </s>
<s> normally sound cards on desktops will have a mic in, line in and line out.  </s>
<s> it may also have a speaker out in addition.  </s>
<s> laptops may not have a line in.  </s>
<s> in your case, it must be line in and not line out.  </s>
<s> please confirm. the cdrw audio cable goes in to the line in socket.  </s>
<s> please post a feedback.  </s>
<s> yes this for audio playback.  </s>
<s> if you have a newer pc the line input is the blue one.  </s>
<s> if you have an older pc you will have to look at the book that came with the pc. john  </s>
