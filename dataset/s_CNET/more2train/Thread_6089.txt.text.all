<s> my drive will only read and write a few 250 zip disk and refuses to read others.  </s>
<s> it just freezes up and the light stays on as though it is operating.  </s>
<s> those it will not recongize it will not format either.  </s>
<s> lets say that i have 7 zip disks.  </s>
<s> four will be read and writable.  </s>
<s> three have files and folders on them but are not at least readable.  </s>
<s> nor can i format them.  </s>
<s> this does not make any difference whether they are 250 or 100 size disks.  </s>
<s> i also have a paralel 250 drive that stopped reading 250 zips and will only read the 100's.  </s>
<s> anyone have any suggestions.  </s>
<s> i am mainly interested in the usb drive.  </s>
<s> thank you  </s>
<s> but they only use them for those that are willing to move to cdrw media and surrender the old disks.  </s>
<s> it's a strange thing but the it gestapo has to kill it off somehow.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> zip drives aren't that good once they get into old age.  </s>
<s> if you have used older zip disks and found them to be failing, they've reached the end of the line.  </s>
<s> further, a bad zip disk can effect other good disks as the wear&tear on the drive itself could be at at fault -or- become faulty due to bad disks.  </s>
<s> once, you experience a bad disk, save whatever data and try to another one, swap data.  </s>
<s> overall, i don't recommend zip drives unless you got to have them.  </s>
<s> they have fallen out of favor with users due to this.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> thank you bob and willy.  </s>
<s> my zip drives are now going to the junk pile.  </s>
<s> only thing that i don't like is, the files on the disks, i can not retrieve unless i send them to iomega and for a price they will get the files off.  </s>
<s> this i don't intend to do, as they got enough of my money.  </s>
<s> also they are of no help with the problem.  </s>
<s> thanks for your replies, larry  </s>
