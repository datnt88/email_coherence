<s> i have a sony playstation 2 and want to hook it up to my home wireless network.  </s>
<s> the only problem is that you can only plug cat5 cable to the network adapter of the ps2 and i don't know of any wireless recivers that you can hook up via cat5.  </s>
<s> i have only seen usb ones, and ones that you put directly in your computer.  </s>
<s> can anybody tell me how to get my ps2 hooked up to my wireless network?  </s>
<s> thank you! -will  </s>
<s> try this unit:  </s>
<s> use apple's airport express to connect to an existing wireless network using an ethernet cable.  </s>
<s> there are a few solutions that might work.  </s>
<s> the first one is pretty obvious and most people don't want to do this, but you could get a really long ethernet cable (cat5) and run the cable from your router to your ps2. or you can share your internet connection from a computer in your house that is already on the wireless network (i don't know how to do this, but i believe it is possible).  </s>
<s> also linksys makes a wireless ethernet bridge, which connects to an ethernet port on a game console, or computer and sends and receives information via the wireless network ( ) has one but it is expensive.  </s>
<s> there is also the wet11 linksys wireless ethernet bridge, but i don't currently have a link to that.  </s>
<s> i bet it is easy to find.  </s>
<s> i believe that is cheaper as well.  </s>
<s> hope this helps  </s>
<s> hello, the best way to connect your ps2 to the wireless network is via a wifi repeater as is sold in the store pixinf.  </s>
<s> this device lets you connect your ps2 to the wireless network anywhere on the home and increases the signal range of existing wireless network.  </s>
<s> works for me perfectly and also use to connect the tv to the internet.  </s>
<s> here is the link: greetings  </s>
