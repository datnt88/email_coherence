<s> i have a viewsonic lcd monitor and was wondering what was the best cleaning product to use.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> they make special lcd spray solutions.  </s>
<s> i use the stuff from monster on my dlp screen, so it should work fine on an lcd.  </s>
<s> check your local computer store.  </s>
<s> click on this link , then click on step four and read towards the bottom.  </s>
<s> cnet says to take a damp cloth and gently wipe it on your lcd.  </s>
<s> i did what they suggested, and it worked fine.  </s>
<s> make sure you don't spray too much water.  </s>
<s> just wanted to make sure i don't mess up my new monitor.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> so it is really critical to make sure that you know how to clean an lcd.  </s>
<s> there was this ad i saw about some sort of tough plastic to protect your lcd. it comes in a variety of sizes like 17inchs, and 19inchs, and is supposed to make text on lcds look clearer.  </s>
<s> it is so tough that you can actually use your lcd as a cutting board!  </s>
<s> i saw an ad for this in pc magazine.  </s>
<s> i'll try to find it and post back.  </s>
<s> i believe this is the product i am talking about.  </s>
<s> for some reason newegg only has a 19inch size. the ad i saw for this product had other sellers(newegg one of them).  </s>
<s> i'll try to find the magazine to check for the other sellers.  </s>
<s> i think i'll just stick to the method that cnet mentioned in their cleaning lesson.  </s>
<s> thanks for the help though.  </s>
<s> i understand that that would probably be the best way to keep the screen clean but it's just too expensive.  </s>
<s> with performance comes price.  </s>
<s> i won't be using my lcd as a cutting board so i won't need it.  </s>
<s> my lcd does get dirty, but a wipe with a damp cloth cleans it just fine.  </s>
<s> good luck.  </s>
<s> to protect my lcd monitor's screen, i bought a piece of thin &quot;optical quality&quot; pexiglass from a local hardware store for roughly $7 -- had to cut it in half.  </s>
<s> taped it on up top.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't recommend this for everyone, since it is home brewed, but it is an option.  </s>
<s> i did it after a pair of round-nosed school scissors dinged my laptop's lcd; it keeps people from playing &quot;darts&quot; with my lcd monitor.  </s>
<s> i bought this for my powerbook, and it works great.  </s>
<s> they include a chamois with the bottle.  </s>
<s> you spray, wipe, buff, and all the fingerprints, dust, and beveage splashes disappear.  </s>
<s> 20 bucks for 150 ml, but you use it [quite] sparingly for best results.  </s>
<s> i used iklear, and moster lcd cleaners, but both left awful smudges and streaks.  </s>
<s> i later found out that they use polymers which do more harm than good. the shaggymac optimist prime lcd spray is the best laptop lcd cleaner i have used.  </s>
<s> when used with their microfiber it cannot be beat.  </s>
<s> even with my sony glossy xbrite screen, it leaves it perfectly clean.  </s>
<s> also the shaggymac laptop screen protector pads are awesome...a must have!  </s>
<s> i use an office depot store brand product called &quot;screencleaner non-streaking&quot; and a scotch brite microfiber cloth which you can also get at od. spray on cloth and wipe on any off monitor.  </s>
<s> i use it on my tv too.  </s>
<s> this system is the goods.  </s>
<s> jv.  </s>
<s> i use a 50:50 mixture water and isopropyl alcohol, moisten a microfibre cloth, wipe screen from one side to the other.  </s>
<s> continue down the screen til finished.  </s>
