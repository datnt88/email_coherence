<s> im stuck between the 7900 cards and the new 8800's.  </s>
<s> i have a legit copy of windoes xp laying around, from which i will built my system with.  </s>
<s> i dont plan on upgrading to vista.  </s>
<s> so if the dx10 doesnt work with windoes xp then i dont want to waste my money on a dx10 card, ill go for a 7900 sli instead.  </s>
<s> thx in advance.  </s>
<s> read  </s>
<s> man i almost went for the 8800 320mb.  </s>
<s> well now at least i can get better performance for less with 7900 sli.  </s>
<s> thx  </s>
<s> i plan on buying halo2, will a dx9 card run fine with it, how far in the future will i be able to play games with dx9.  </s>
<s> that's what my crystal ball said so i'm sticking with that.  </s>

<s> ^lol  </s>
<s> as i burn rubber to the store... sorry, your guess is as good as mine on that one.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> an 8800 gts 320 will outperform a 7900 gt 512, 7900gtx, and 7950 with no problems and will even hold its own against 7900 in sli.  </s>
<s> not sure how much you've looked into it, but just thought i'd throw in my two cents!  </s>
<s> 8800gts 320mb is faster in most games than 7900gs in sli.  </s>
<s> and you don't have to worry about the niggles that sli can cause.  </s>
<s> im not as knowledgable about the specifications about videocards as u guys. the way i compared how the 7900's in sli would be faster is, i just doubled the clock speeds and compared it to the single 8800, but i guess i was wrong.  </s>
<s> if the 8800's indeed are that fast i have have no problem purchasing one of them or even sli'ing it later.  </s>
<s> cool, now i learned something new.  </s>
<s> isnt pc gaming so much fun (and lots of $, lol).  </s>
<s> i read somewhere that older cards like the 7900's with 512mb run better then the new 8800 with 320mb cuz of less memory or something.  </s>
<s> the 8800gts/320mb starts to stumble at high resolutions.  </s>
<s> however at resolutions below 1920x1200, the 8800gts is as fast as a 7950gt (dual 7900gtxs).  </s>
<s> so unless you've got a 24&quot; widescreen or larger, one 8800gts/320 will smoke two 7900gs cards.  </s>
<s> everyone is familiar with microsoft's subtle, gentle pushes to upgrade to the latest and newest and more expensive software, e.g. &quot;we will no longer provide security packs or updates to this version of windows after this date.&quot;  </s>
<s> what's the word with win xp? i agree with you, i see no point in moving to vista.  </s>
<s> my wife can get an outrageous educator discount, my system will handle everything but the highest aero demands (128mb pcie card) but i'm having a hard time figuring out &quot;why&quot;.  </s>
<s> win xp was a phenomenal jump over windows 98se in terms of stability, usability, pnp, security, etc. but i don't see the radical need this time.  </s>
<s> i know adoption of vista has gone well but is not replacing xp all over the world.  </s>
<s> sooo...... anyone heard any rumors about how long microsoft will continue to support win xp before putting it out to pasture?  </s>
<s> i'll pass on the web site but ms does answer that and the dates change with time so my answer will be incorrect as soon as it changes.  </s>
<s> but let's look at windows nt 4.0.  </s>
<s> while it was left with a gaping security hole we fix that with a firewall.  </s>
<s> now what's left?  </s>
<s> applications, not the os. who needs internet explorer?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i think this is getting off-topic, but i would like to make a point.  </s>
<s> i recently figured out how to backup and restore windows with 'bart pe' so if anything happens (viruses, corrupted files) i can restore it as it was.  </s>
<s> as for security updates, i think most hackers will move on to the new vista and most importanatly i won't be botherd by a massage like &quot;secuity updates are ready to be downloaded&quot; in the middle of the game (lol), if ms stops issuing them.  </s>
<s> direct x 10 is a whole new patch over direct x 9c and will cause your directx 9 video card to crash if you can even get it to load  </s>
