<s> i currently have a 19&quot; trinitron crt (14&quot; horizontal viewing width).  </s>
<s> due to eye surgery and eyeglass issues i have to get a monitor as low to the desktop as possible to avoid having to look upward too much.  </s>
<s> i'm looking at both 17&quot; lcd and 19&quot;lcd.  </s>
<s> i understand that the native resolution is 1280 x 1024 for maximum clarity.  </s>
<s> right now i have my crt at 1024 x 768.  </s>
<s> here are my questions: assuming that i have to have the maximum clarity, should i make the logical assumtion that the icons, etc. are going to be smaller than on my 19&quot; crt.  </s>
<s> would the 19&quot; lcd give me larger icons than the 17&quot;.  </s>
<s> this can be a potential problem because the 19&quot; screen size will be taller and i will have another 2&quot; to look up.  </s>
<s> how tall is the viewing height on each.  </s>
<s> width can also be an issue here becasue i don't have as good peripheral vision now and want to minimize moving my head from side to side. are there any lcds width a native resolution of 1024 x 768?  </s>
<s> also would a digital video card do anything here.  </s>
<s> thanks, marc  </s>
<s> you can get lcds that adjust for height.  </s>
<s> you might get, if you don't already have one, a pneumatic chair that can rise up a bit.  </s>
<s> yes, lcds work best in their native resolution and, with 17&quot; and 19&quot; having the same one, the 17 will produce smaller icons.  </s>
<s> if you wear glasses which are bi/trifocals, get a pair of single vision lenses optimized for your normal position from head to screen.  </s>
<s> xp will let you make the icons larger and stay with the native resolutin so that's not a problem.  </s>
<s> there are also some &quot;accessibility&quot; options that you can work with.  </s>
<s> hope this helps.  </s>
<s> inlarging icons, thevlower the resolution the bigger and easier to read. the lcds, which can mount on adjustable bracket thats on ur wall would help u hope you heal good konny  </s>
<s> thanks for all the suggestions.  </s>
<s> i'd tried some and considered all.  </s>
<s> i learned that 15&quot; monitors have a native resolution of 1024 x 768.  </s>
<s> that horizontal viewing size is very close to my 19&quot; crt.  </s>
<s> does that mean that the height is the same as my crt which is 11&quot;?  </s>
<s> most importantly, am i correct in thinking that the 1024 x 768 resolution is the same actual icon and text size on both types?  </s>
<s> finally, i see that there are few 15&quot; anymore so i need some reccomendations.  </s>
<s> i have a tv tuner card in my computer and often watch tv both in a small box and full screen if this matters.  </s>
<s> i can check the manf.  </s>
<s> web sites to see if they will take one of those arm mounts on the back although i assume that they all can.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance for the info.  </s>
