<s> does anyone have any suggestion as to the least expensive route to acquiring a battery for an old thinkpad?  </s>
<s> thx.  </s>
<s> there's e-bay, but in your post you didn't raise the issue that you may want the battery to hold a charge... then, in a pinch i did find a battery rebuilder.  </s>
<s> it was for a model that i couldn't buy a battery for, so the 70 bucks was worth it.  </s>
<s> in closing, your part of the world may not be like mine, so my lowest cost won't be yours.  </s>
<s> so it's up to you to search for such things in your neck of the woods.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> you think vendors are in cohoos with each other when pricing of new batteries tend to be close, too close.  </s>
<s> you can check your area for a possible used battery from a computer shop, etc. or online via some web search, etc.. batteries are just a fact of life as a possible future investment in keeping your laptop running, so consider is it worth the hassle?  </s>
<s> to do so for your model laptop, even if its a favorite of yours.  </s>
<s> sometimes, its better to run a cross a &quot;used similar laptop&quot; and buy the whole setup vs. the battery alone. the problem will only come back again as the new battery will be like the old one after awhile, maybe 12-18mos.  </s>
<s> of usage.  </s>
<s> so good luck -----willy  </s>
