<s> i work for a company as a media handler.  </s>
<s> another big company contracts to our company to pull tapes from the libraries and send them offsite.  </s>
<s> we had 3 accounts that went somewhere else for their media storage needs a few years back.  </s>
<s> they left behind over 3 thousand+ tapes that we sold to a buyer or reseller. the tapes had old data on them.  </s>
<s> this information was important enough to back up and maybe had ss numbers included.  </s>
<s> was this a bad thing and did our company break any laws?  </s>
<s> you could have bulk erased such prior to sale to avoid being taken to task for not even trying.  </s>
<s> if you can't even contact a lawyer to help you in this matter, your services are very lacking.  </s>
<s> afterall, you are talking about the future of your/the company and to think you believe ssn# maybe present just doesn't bode well for you.  </s>
<s> all data whether old or new becomes a matter for destruction because it data.  </s>
<s> sound funny but value is always attached to data and protection key to safeguard it.  </s>
<s> if safeguard is nothing more than storage, then somewhere in your lease/contract should be the handling of it when the client is no longer able to pay, doesn't release you from it &quot;safe keeping&quot;.  </s>
<s> in most cases, destruction is likely.  </s>
<s> it doesn't matter if you';re a 3rd party or 4th, etc., somewhere the data has to be deleted at least in a proper world, imho.  </s>
