please help me my cablenet disconnects after i have been surfing for a while then when i restart my computer the net turns on again and then goes off again please help me 
i can't guess. 
at this point and amount of detail you should be calling the isp or cable co. 
bob 
some isp vendors provide some diags to help resolve problems. 
check your install cd or isp install directory for any such s/w. 
further, if none or no clue to the problem, then your isp support(phone) can help under thier attention. 
plus, you really didn't tell us what isp, system, os, etc. is part of your setup to help you.
