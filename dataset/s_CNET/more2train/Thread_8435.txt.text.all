<s> so i'm looking to purchase my first tablet and acknowledge up front that technology has never been my thing.  </s>
<s> however, i think i've narrowed down my decision to the google nexus 7 comming out this month.  </s>
<s> my questions are these: 1. does the tablet i purchase necessarily limit from where i can purchase ebooks and other media?  </s>
<s> my concern is that if i buy a particular tablet that i may be limited it's proprietary online store limiting either my selection or charging unfair rates for ebooks that might be offered elsewhere cheaper.  </s>
<s> 2. if i am limited, how does google (for nexus 7) compare with amazon (for kindle fire).  </s>
<s> please explain if i'm not understanding issue properly.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> 2. let's take on your question by asking more questions.  </s>
<s> if you get some android and install the kindle app, wouldn't that let you get access to that?  </s>
<s> and with that android i can install the barnes noble app and get stuff there as well.  </s>
<s> the kindle fire is a good device but i don't see it being as open as other pads but then again, you can read pdfs and more on it.  </s>
<s> just don't expect to find the other competitor reader software on it.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i got the sony ereader. the best part was the ereader app for my pc. also the epub format gives you more flexibility and a better price point than the kindle does.  </s>
<s> why amazon wants you to pay more than half price for an ebook beats me.  </s>
<s> common amazon.  </s>
<s> if ebooks cost you less than half to make and they're are looked down to you so you cannot lend them or borrow some-one elses book like you can with a hard copy, then you should pay alot less!  </s>
<s> imho ebook readers are in general too small.  </s>
<s> so the one thing apple got right was the size of the ipad.  </s>
<s> i will get the asus transformer android tablet soon as the ereaders are too small and too slow and you cannot read technical pdf files very well.  </s>
<s> there are also lots of cheap android tablets that would most likely give you a better experience than an ereader device and way more flexibility.  </s>
<s> that being said, if you only read novels and one at a time, then a cheap ereader might suffice, else the colour tablets are way more flexible.  </s>
<s> then it just comes down to reading at night in bed - go android or reading in daylight go ereader, and the battery life.  </s>
<s> i have had three ereaders from the original kindle to the kindle fire and nook color.  </s>
<s> recently, i put a microsd chip in my nook that turned the nook into an android reader.  </s>
<s> as an android i have access to the entire android market (you don't have that with either the nook or kindle) where i downloaded the kindle and barnes and noble apps.  </s>
<s> when i want to download a book i go to both amazon and b&n and download the one with the cheapest price (usually they are the same). the nexus 7 will be an android reader so you will have the same capability.  </s>
<s> the 7&quot; tablet is a good size for a reader.  </s>
<s> it is easy to carry and hold while reading.  </s>
<s> as to the response that the cost of ebooks should be much less that paper books is not true.  </s>
<s> i worked for a publisher for 14 years and the cheapest part of the cost is the printing and binding.  </s>
<s> the majority of the cost goes into the editing and author royalties.  </s>
<s> yes, ebooks should be cheaper than the paper version, but the reduction should be closer to 15% not 50%.  </s>
<s> if your considering getting the nexus then i'd have to say go with it.  </s>
<s> from the reviews and my own personal interaction with it at previews i'd have to say that it is rather good for its price (around $299).  </s>
<s> it is pretty cool, and with google play it is a god send.  </s>
<s> you have no idea how better i feel when holding this and reading a book than holding an overpriced ipad instead and always worrying about losing it.  </s>
