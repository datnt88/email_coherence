ok i am in a dilemma. 
although i am knowledgable about computer hard/software as a whole, i know absolutely nothing about networking, routers, etc. now, here's my problem. 
i play a game called altitude at (i'm skywalker). 
i want to know how to set up my own server to play. 
it's not acutally a server, more like a pseudo-server. the problem is that my server gets up but it can't communicate with other computers i think. 
if that confuses you scroll down to the next paragraph. 
ok, i have traced the problem to needing to forward or open up the ports on my router. 
how do you do this? 
by ports i mean like port 28020, port 33464, etc. how do you open up or forward a port on your router? 
i have a linksys wireless router. 
also, don't tell me it's my firewall becauase i already shut it off. 
and you will find a lot of setting you can play with... the address... look in the manual/help file.. 
where is the router configuration page? 
(this is really how stupid i am) 
default router configuration page for linksys routers is . 
default password is in the router manual/user guide for your router. 
download it from linksys.com
