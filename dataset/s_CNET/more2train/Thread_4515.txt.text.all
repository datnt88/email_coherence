any problem using wd40 on mobo's or cards? 
water displacement formula 40? 
this should get interesting...... i wouldn't.... possible to cause a short dust attractant heat displacment reduction fire -&gt; short/heat cable connectivity you ever see an object sprayed with wd40, one month later - sitting in a hot shed? 
it will be sticky and covered in dirt and dust. 
bill . 
for the typical user there's no need for wd40 use inside the system. 
unless, you're stuck in the jungle or artic circle, forget about it. 
if you want to spray your lectronics, then get one &quot;intended for such usage&quot; and even then more than likely for contact surfaces. 
good luck -----willy
