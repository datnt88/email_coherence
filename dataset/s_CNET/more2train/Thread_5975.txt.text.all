this is the second microphone i've bought for my windows xp computer and i plug the thing into the pink jack and turn it on and the sound effect manager detects the microphone but when i try to use speech recognition like windows xp says to do in help, there is no option for the microphone to speak and in sound recorder i get no sound line recording!!! please help, how do i get the microphone to work? 
i want to be able to record sound with videos on my logitech quickcam webcam! 
please help. 
if you double click your speaker in the tray and then go to properties you'll see theres a slider there for the microphone. is it muted? 
and the way you said to put the sound in the taskbar was the only way to find this out. 
thanks so much. 
the microphone was muted.
