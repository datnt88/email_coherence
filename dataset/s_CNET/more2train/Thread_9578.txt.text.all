in the sticky at the top of this forum, pudgyone at some point said use wpa, not wpa2. 
what is the reason for that, since wpa2 is a later version and presumably more secure. 
also, just read an article today re: two guys who claim to have partially cracked wpa. 
if not you might ask what you just did. 
i didn't read the other one. 
thanks for pointing it out. 
next time i'll remember: rtfs.
