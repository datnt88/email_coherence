<s> hi... i have amd 2000+ &quot;pvcle266m-l&quot; i want to make it fast so wat should i do, like what should be added to it for egs ram, some pci accesories, etc  </s>
<s> add system ram, a hard drive, a video card, a psu, and an operating system and it should work.  </s>
<s> not what you were expecting?  </s>
<s> that's because we have no idea what you already have installed on that motherboard besides an &quot;amd 2000+&quot; cpu.  </s>
<s> i have 512+256mb ram 40gb hdd, and this pvcle266-m is a mercury motherboard and processor (builtin processor) so what changes can i do, i have windows xp and windows 2000, and windows 2000 is extremely fast and win xp is like below average, so wat should i do to make xp fast, other than diskdefragment,etc only components  </s>
<s> in terms of hardware upgrades, probably adding a pci (not pci express) video card with its own dedicated (not shared) video memory will provide the best performance boost.  </s>
<s> however, new core 2 duo and athlon 64 x2 systems are a steal right now.  </s>
<s> i'd lean towards investing in a new computer.  </s>
