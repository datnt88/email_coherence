just wondering if data weights anything. 
does an unformatted 200gb hdd weight less than the same drive filled with movies? 
i'm just curious about what &quot;data&quot; really is. 
except on your heart and mind when you lose it.

======= think about it like this. 
data is characters...a&gt;z...0&gt;9...etc. 
movies are data.

======== think about it like this. a new unformatted hd is filled with something...let's call it blanks. 
if you send a movie/data to the hd you 'change' the blanks to data. 
blanks and data weigh the same. 
generally speaking, yes, you won't feel any more weight from a raw drive and a formatted drive, at the micron and sub-micron level things are different, but practically speaking, no, there is no difference
