is there a way i can break out the cost of onboard components like video &quot;cards&quot; that are built in to the motherboard? 
i can't seem to find a way to do that. 
chips such as you find onboard are rarely sold on the retail market. 
you can &quot;guess&quot; by taking said chipset and finding a video card that uses it but that's about it.

boards like this are made for professional use, video editing, music producing etc. but there isnt the same market for these bare essential boards as there is for the boards that have everything built on. 
there are minimalist boards available but they are very very expensive.
