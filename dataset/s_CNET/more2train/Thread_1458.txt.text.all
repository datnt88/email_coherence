<s> hey i currently own both cards and was wondering which would be better for games.  </s>
<s> i understand that both are fairly low end cards but i cannot afford to buy a new one at the moment.  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> in the bandwidth area their both close.  </s>
<s> perhaps the answer is try both with the games your playing....see if you can tell a difference.  </s>
<s> i'm sure there are benchmarks and web pages on this but why not give them a workout and choose?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> yeah i was just looking for a lazy way around it i guess and the specs on them dont really help one has a faster bandwidth the other has a faster core clock etc  </s>
<s> to try the web.  </s>
<s> i think tomshardware.com has benchmarks.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> tried both cards in my pc and the gt520 gives around a 15% fps boost to the same settings on dawn of war 2, coh and tf2.  </s>
<s> just thought id post the results incase someone else is interested or needs to know etc  </s>
