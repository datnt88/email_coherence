<s> is it possible for a hard drive to overheat and cause lock-ups?  </s>
<s> i've put fans on everything else that could overheat and im still having heat problems.  </s>
<s> i see some try everything but the cover off.  </s>
<s> &quot;i have fans.&quot;  </s>
<s> -&gt; also, try my usual scans of housecall and ewido.  </s>
<s> cheers, bob  </s>
<s> how are you capturing or measuring thet 'overheat' info ??? vapcmd  </s>
<s> i had taken the cover off after and its stopped.  </s>
<s> i'm not sure if its the hard drives that are overheating, i just locked it up, took off the case and felt everything.  </s>
<s> cpu, video card, and chipset were all nice and cool while the hard drives were burning hot.  </s>
<s> with the side off/open....does it still overheat ?  </s>
<s> what case do you have ?  </s>
<s> make and model # how many case fans do you have ...at the case front, the case back ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> it stopped freezing and its some 10 year old case i fished out of my basement.  </s>
<s> besides all i want to know is if it's possible for a hard drive to overheat and cause lock-ups.  </s>
<s> yes....definitely possible for the hdd as well as other components to overheat and cause the pc to lockup.  </s>
<s> i thought you were interested in indentifying the cause and finding a way to eliminate the heat other than leaving the case open.  </s>
<s> i plan on getting a new case and one of those hard drive cooling things to put in it.  </s>
<s> i just needed to know if it was possible.  </s>
<s> you won't need any special hard drive cooling if you buy a well designed case with good airflow over the hard disk drives.  </s>
<s> with the case below which includes a 400 watt ps, i'd probably add a 120mm fan in the front which would ensure cool outside air coming in from the front over the hard drives.  </s>

<s> as you revealed elsewhere... sorry but you've likely toasted your machine.  </s>
<s> i thought i had good air flow but after a failure i decided to record the hdd temperature.  </s>
<s> 49c (120f).  </s>
<s> way too hot.  </s>
<s> ended up installing a cooling fan and the temperature dropped to 33c.  </s>
<s> i wrote an article about my experience.  </s>
<s> see can supply cheap temperature recorders if anyone needs one.  </s>
<s> speedfan it is freeware.  </s>
<s> this will tell you what your temperatures are.  </s>
<s> i'd advise that you not use the &quot;clock&quot; feature unless you know precisely what your doing.  </s>
<s> here are two hard drive cooler to consider should you need them.  </s>
