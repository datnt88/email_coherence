<s> i have a hp 3-1 printer conected to my windows 98 pc via usb.  </s>
<s> my wife has a lap top with wifi.  </s>
<s> we currently are using a cable modem with a linksys wireless-g router for internet and voip.  </s>
<s> can i put a wireless print server on the printer so that we can share the printer and still have it hard wired through to my pc or would i then need a wifi card for my pc to use the printer.  </s>
<s> i'm new at this whole wireless thing.  </s>
<s> i understand if i had xp instead of windows 98 that i could share the pinter that way.  </s>
<s> any advise?  </s>
<s> now i'm wondering if i could use a wired usb print server to my linksys router.  </s>
<s> would this give me access from both my wired pc and wireless laptop?  </s>
<s> you might only be able to share the printing features.. not the other features of the printer...  </s>
<s> if you have a laptop that is going through the router then adding/putting the printer on a wireless print server both machines will be able to use it also. the server you get will have either a usb port or parallel port or possibly both.  </s>
<s> then the hardwire machine does not have to be on if the laptop wanted to print something, per the setup you stated in the original posting.  </s>
