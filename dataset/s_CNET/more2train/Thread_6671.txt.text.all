<s> before connecting a new desktop pc to the internet for the first time using either cable modem or dsl; besides having a very good anti-virus software program installed; what other software should i also have installed before i connect to the internet using a high speed connection for the first time?  </s>
<s> big steve end of message 02/04/05  </s>
<s> if your os is xp, you will want service pack 2 installed prior to your first time connection if possible.  </s>
<s> your broadband connection should also connect through a router which has a nat (hardware) firewall.  </s>
<s> this is a deterent and not totally secure, however.  </s>
<s> you will want a decent browser and e-mail handler and the two that come from ms with xp are not on the &quot;good&quot; list.  </s>
<s> you can also install a software firewall but these may take some tweaking to make them work as you wish.  </s>
<s> i use the free sygate product.  </s>
<s> i don't know if it's ever blocked an attack but that's not what's most important.  </s>
<s> lastly, an overlooked defense is ones personal care while surfing.  </s>
<s> some would say never jump off a building without a parachute.  </s>
<s> i say, never jump off a building.  </s>
<s> hope that helps.  </s>
<s> hi big steve, i see you are concerned about your new computer's security especially since you recently posted the other day: steven haninger is an excellent computer tech and has given good advice along with others, but since you have made two different threads showing your concern, may i suggest you post in the virus & security alerts forum.  </s>
<s> there are many experts there just waiting for someone concerned like you to post.  </s>
<s> as for myself, on my best desktop (winxp sp2), i have nortons systems works (it has the antivirus included along with other great stuff), and two free spyware detection programs (adaware & spybot), and the new beta microsoft anti-spyware (currently free until around july).  </s>
<s> i have the firewall in winxp sp2 disabled to use the free zone alarm firewall as it gives coverage on the in and out.  </s>
<s> on my other computers i use the free avast antivirus program instead of the free avg, free spyware (adaware & spybot) and the free zone alarm firewall.  </s>
<s> regards,  </s>
