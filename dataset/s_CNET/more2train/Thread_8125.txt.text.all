hi, i have a g4 quicksilver 733mhz i would like to buy an internal dvd-rw (dubble layer) do replace my cd-rw. 
my 2 cheapest options here are: toshiba's sd-r53-72b or sony's dvd-22a. 
i couldn't find information wheather they support the mac or not. 
could someone advise me about that or recommand other models that will work. 
i don't want to get the pioneer superdrive 106 or 107. 
i want the top of the line dvd-rw (x16 and dubble-layer). 
and i want it to be internal. 
thanks
