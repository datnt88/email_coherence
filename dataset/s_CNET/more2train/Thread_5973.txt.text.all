i try to burn .avi 
movies and it tells me i need a codec but i dont know witch to buy? 
since nero is for the pc (most of the time) maybe you can try demos of... winavi and dvdsanta bob 
but they dont convert all movie do they? 
but there is no product that does. 
so i guess you could send someone off to find such if you wanted to get rid of them?
