hi. thanks in advance for any help or suggestions. 
i have a telus wireless gateway with a laptop connnected wireless.. at the other end of the house, i have 2 more pc's, 1 is connected with a wireless adapter. 
,the third doesn't have wireless capibilities. the way the building is laid out, running an ethernet cable is not an option. 
i'm talking down a flight of stairs , through three rooms and the garage, up another flight of stairs etc.running it externally wouldn't be much better. 
i understand i should simply go buy a wireless adapter for the third pc but i'm completely tapped, unemployed, disabled and waiting till the 17th for my second hip replacement. 
i do have a dlink wireless router(dsl604+) aswell as the wireless gateway. 
my question is , is it possible to make a wireless connection between the gateway and router (both are wireless) and then use an ethernet between the router and the third pc?? it's my wifes computer. 
we moved 3 months ago and i feel just horrible not having her connected yet as she does alot of online gaming and socializing to relax after work. 
if not , what would be a good way to connect her pc to my pc with a cable and share my wireless internet connection?? both pc's are runing xphome edition sp3. 
i also have a dslcable router this would mean having 2 network connections on my pc, one wireless to the gateway, and an ethernet to the cable router/her pc. i'm not sure if this is possible and please excuse my ignorance. 
again ,thanks in advance for any help/suggestions/ideas/tips/enlightenment,etc.

you're not going to have any joy with this idea unless one (or both?) of the routers support wds. 
have a look at the routers' user interfaces or download the manuals from mfrs site. 
thanks for the quick reply. 
i'll see if it's support.
