<s> i have been in the dark ages of technology but recently purchased a dell dimension 3000 series desktop.  </s>
<s> it is the first time i've ever had any experience with a dvd rom drive, so i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong.  </s>
<s> i tried to play a 2-disc dvd set that is supposed to have enhanced computer features.  </s>
<s> when i insert disc 1 everything works correctly.  </s>
<s> it will play the movie like on any dvd player, and it will also pop-up a special dvd rom menu and allow access to the special features on disc 1. however, when i click on most of the special features they tell me i must insert disc 2, which i then do, but the second disc will only play as a regular dvd and will not allow access to any dvd rom features or the dvd rom menu.  </s>
<s> it is extremely frustrating because i have no idea where to even begin to correct this problem, and it seems unlikely that there would be a compatibility issue or need for an upgrade when it will play one disc from the set but not the other.  </s>
<s> but, as i stated, i have no idea about this kind of technology.  </s>
<s> my dvd rom is sony dvd-rom ddu1615 and i'm using interactual player 2.6 i went to the support website for the actual dvd, but it merely informs me that if i'm having trouble accesses the the dvd rom features i will need to install the lastest version of macromedia flash player and have apple quicktime version 6 or above.  </s>
<s> i have all of these components and don't understand the problem  </s>
<s> 1. some of my dvds don't work either.  </s>
<s> 2. a firewall could be a culprit for some of these.  </s>
<s> 3. if you think pc support is bad, wait till you try to get dvd support.  </s>
<s> (oops, you did on item 3.) that leaves us with possible firewall issues.  </s>
<s> is xp all patched up and zonealarm installed?  </s>

<s> &lt;that leaves us with possible firewall issues.  </s>
<s> is xp all patched up and zonealarm installed?&gt;  </s>
<s> i have no idea what that is or how to install it - which is most likely the problem.  </s>
<s> i told you i was in the dark ages of technology!  </s>
<s> please help.  </s>
<s> the nice part about today is we have google.com.  </s>
<s> you could find out what zonealarm is and install the free version.  </s>
<s> why i note zonealarm is that the dvd software &quot;might&quot; need to access the internet for the features (some of mine do) and for such to work the stock xp firewall simply blocked the connection where zonealarm asked permission.  </s>
<s> if your machine needed other updates such as flash you could also research that on google.com  </s>
