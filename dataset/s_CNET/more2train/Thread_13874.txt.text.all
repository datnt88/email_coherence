i was using some video editing program and burning a dvd, when the dvd player started acting up. 
it wasnt burning, but was still spinning and making noises like it was. 
i closed the application in the task manager, but the dvd player just kept humming like it was still burning. 
i shut down the computer, but the dvd player kept humming along and the computer wouldnt come to a full shut down. 
after a few mins, i unplugged the darn thing to get it to stop. 
which it did. 
now my computer wont boot up. 
just black screen. 
i am using windows la vista. 
i have a 2 month old custom built computer and this dvd-rw player is new as well. 
i'm at work using the computer to try to get some answers before i go home. 
do you think unplugging the dvd rom cables inside the computer would help and then trying to restart? 
with the thoughts that the dvd player is the culprit? 
i have another dvd player in the computer, so do you think it would boot from the la vista cd and i could attempt a repair? 
i can usually fix problems if i can get a computer to turn on, but when i cant. 
then i'm usually at a loss, as this appears to be a hardware issue now, instead of a software issue. 
this is my computer: jr p45-t2rs motherboard , with a intel duo core e8400 cpu, 4 gigs of ddr2 800 memory, and an ati 4500 vid card i think it is. 
the drive had some odd failure so we unplugged it and later replaced it. 
why not try unplugging it? 
what computer is this? it looks like some homebrew. 
bob 
that's what i'm doing now. 
unplugging the offending dvd player and gonna try seeing if it will boot up now. 
yes. 
it's a crazy homebrew put together with new and old pieces. 
i only kept the 2 sata hardrives and a dvd player.. 
that didnt work. 
now i have no clue what to do... *sigh* 
a disconnected dvd player is the cause the machine doesn't boot. 
that's really strange!
