<s> this might not be the right place to ask, but i'll go ahead.. i currently have a wireless router 802.11b (netgear), and i was wanting to upgrade.  </s>
<s> mostly because of the faster g and when i originally bought my router i new nothing about networking.  </s>
<s> well, now i still don't know a heck of a lot, but i do know i want to be more secure.  </s>
<s> i have been reading up on wep and wpa, and ssid, but i'm a little lost on setting it up.  </s>
<s> anyway, what i really want to know is some people suggestions of good wireless routers.  </s>
<s> good as in good range, ease of setup (especially for noobs), and good support.  </s>
<s> i'm kind of leaning towards the netgear wgr614 only because i currently have a netgear and has been working fine.  </s>
<s> any and all suggestions welcome!! sean  </s>
<s> personally, i'm a belkin man.  </s>
<s> and life goes on... jack  </s>
<s> thanks for the link!  </s>
<s> trust me i do check cnet before any tech purchase i make. the thing is, that cnet hasn't done a router review in a while.  </s>
<s> i'd really like to see a &quot;router throwdown&quot;.  </s>
<s> something that takes the newer or most popular routers on the market and puts them head to head.  </s>
<s> some of the routers in the &quot;editor's choice&quot; either don't exist anymore, or have been replaced by a new model or line.  </s>
<s> i think an update would be nice.  </s>
<s> any other suggestions is still welcome!! sean  </s>
<s> i have 5 supermax cards still in the box.  </s>
<s> they're there because i procrastinated long enough to see the &quot;pre-n&quot; standard come out.  </s>
<s> even though the w3c hasn't fully adopted the standard (they will) yet i'm going to install belkin's pre-n routers and controllers.  </s>
<s> good luck!! and life goes on... jack  </s>
<s> very simple to use, excellent on line support, and super fast email response.  </s>
<s> as far as range, they are all the same.  </s>
<s> fcc regulations limit transmitted power so they all have the same range.  </s>
