<s> gateway has provided an updated bios to fix battery issues but no instructions on how to actually perform the bios update.  </s>
<s> does anyone know how to do the bios update?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance  </s>
<s> given your story and we have no reason to update the bios, why do this?  </s>
<s> resolution: if the battery discharges below a certain charge level, it may not be able to be recharged unless the system bios is flashed to revision 3102 or later.  </s>
<s> only problem is that gateway doesn't tell you how to do it.  </s>
<s> i always leave it to the makers to tell how.  </s>
<s> if they don't we have to ask them.  </s>
<s> you don't want to have a forum tell you how without referring back to the maker's site.  </s>
<s> you must be on guard since a bum bios install may cost you dearly.  </s>
