<s> i have a desktop computer with linksys wireless usb adapter plugged in.  </s>
<s> sometimes when i try to get on the internet and cannot , i click the notification symbol and it is scanning.  </s>
<s> i tried calling them and i was put on hold and tried their website but had to register for their forums and got no answer.  </s>
<s> sometimes it scans for more than an hour sometimes less.  </s>
<s> why is it scanning?it  </s>
<s> does not always scan i can just access the internet with ease.  </s>
<s> rebooting does not help.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> such as what router you have and did you set it up like we ask at i know a few that use their neighbors wifi and for them, that scanning is normal since you're never sure the neighbor's wifi is on.  </s>

<s> i live in a basement apartment with my internet done through my landlady's router upstairs.  </s>
<s> do not want to get her involved.i have a wireless laptop which i can use instead of my desktop and does not involve the linskeys.  </s>
<s> i was just wondering what scanning it is doing on the desktop and if i can stop it from scanning and still use the internet.  </s>
<s> what is it scanning for?  </s>
<s> maybe signal strength is too low?  </s>
<s> since you don't own the router, connection and being in a basement doesn't help matters at all.  </s>
<s> nothing wrong here.  </s>
