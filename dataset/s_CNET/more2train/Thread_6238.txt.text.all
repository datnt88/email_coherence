<s> i am having a problem with my peer to peer network, i am running windows xp home on both pc's with a cable modem connection, and i have had this network for about a year and it always worked fine until i reformatted both pc's harddrives and reinstalled windows on both.now when i am online on one pc say using aol and sign onto aol on the other computer i lose my connection on the pc that the connection is shared on, and if for example i am playing an online game on the pc that is borrowing the connection, soon as the other pc starts surfing the net i lose my connection, and like i said before this was not a problem till i reinstalled windows on both pc's could there be a setting or something that was lost that i need to do again.  </s>
