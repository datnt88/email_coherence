<s> i have an epson workforce 600, which i like very much, but i suddenly have a problem.  </s>
<s> i can't print anything off of the internet.  </s>
<s> i can print normal email and documents that i've saved.  </s>
<s> i tried to print airline confirmation that came with my email message, and all i got was blank pages that rolled through the printer.  </s>
<s> i just attempted to print some movie theater info off the internet, and the same thing happened.  </s>
<s> i can't find any information in my epson booklet about this kind of problem.  </s>
<s> i just downloaded a new driver, but that didn't help.  </s>
<s> can someone please help me?  </s>
<s> turns out the problem isn't my printer, it's my browser.  </s>
<s> printer works fine with internet explorer but not with firefox. is there a forum for browsers?  </s>
<s> check the firefox setting and enable/disable what maybe interfering.  </s>
<s> you can also look into any &quot;add-ons&quot; if you use them as well.  </s>
<s> if definitely the browser, then delete it and reload it again, but save your favorites for later return.  </s>
<s> if you like try a &quot;restore point&quot; to to a date before the problem.  </s>
<s> if that works and later it doesn't, then some update maybe at work here.  </s>
<s> i exclude any system issues.  </s>
<s> fyi- i have firefox and it works printing whatever i deem necessary.  </s>
<s> this is going to be one of those problems that someone reports on and us firefox users point to a fix or you have something unique to you.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> thank you, willy.  </s>
<s> it's definitely the browser, so i think i'll uninstall it and try again.  </s>
<s> after reading all the comments everywhere on the net, uninstalling firefox and reinstalling, nothing worked.  </s>
<s> (like you, it worked on ie).  </s>
<s> apparently the cause was a ms update.  </s>
<s> i just right-clicked the printer in the printers and devices folder and removed the printer (with the printer off).  </s>
<s> then i turned the printer on.  </s>
<s> the drivers were automatically installed and voila!  </s>
<s> everything worked.  </s>
