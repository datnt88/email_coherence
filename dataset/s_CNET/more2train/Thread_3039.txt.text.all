<s> but then you need to configure it to use the security, such as: wpa, wpa2 or wep and change the default ssid, then you need to use mac address filtering to make your network secure.  </s>

<s> ...firmware versions that allow the network administrator to disable the wireless ability of the router (more than just turning off the ssid broadcast).  </s>
