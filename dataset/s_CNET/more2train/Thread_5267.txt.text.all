<s> i have an asus p5ld2, with a dualcore 3.4ghz processor.  </s>
<s> i bought 4x1gb pc-6400 800mhz ddr2 ram, and a used core2duo e6600 2.4ghz processor.  </s>
<s> unfortunately, turns out that my motherboard only supports this cpu, if it's rev2.0 and up, mine was rev1.02.  </s>
<s> plus, the bios reads the 4gb ram as pc-5300 400mhz (hwinfo32 does show the proper info though).  </s>
<s> so... not wanting to waste the new ram, and the processor was pretty cheap so, found a used asus p5q board for sale.  </s>
<s> before i run into any other problems... can anyone see any potential issues?  </s>
<s> like will the power supply i have for the p5ld2 work on a p5q?  </s>
<s> should the ram read at full speed?  </s>
<s> anything?  </s>
<s> just wanting to avoid a headache before it happens.  </s>
<s> thanks.  </s>
<s> i don't know how much performance gain with the e6600 (it maybe core2duo but it's also at lower speed).  </s>
<s> i probably would just save it for the next computer (using ddr3...much cheaper than ddr2).  </s>
<s> just my thinking on this.  </s>
<s> well, as per the op... i have the cpu/fan ($25) and already bought the ram ($30) so more just looking for potential issues.  </s>
<s> next computer will be an 8-core mac pro that i'm saving up for, hence wanting a cheap upgrade vs buying a barebone core i5 system.  </s>
<s> i'll dual boot it wil osx and win7.  </s>
<s> right now, i'm using my pc as both a computer and running xbmc as a media centre.  </s>
<s> once i have the mac, this will get dumped into a nicer desktop case and used for xbmc only, so, don't really need a $500 upgrade, was hoping $50 and done.  </s>
<s> just, didn't know about the motherboard needing to be rev2.0 and up, that was a kick in the pants.  </s>
<s> if another $50 for an asus p5q is all i need, i'll be happy.  </s>
<s> that being said, i can't find info about things like power supply connectors... not sure if the p5ld2 and p5q have the same plugs or not.  </s>
<s> i benchmarked a dell 745 which showed a good increase in performance over my pc which runs the e6600... and mine has a much better video card and ram.  </s>
<s> my theory is that i'll see a decent amount of speed increase... - my video card is a pci-e v2.0 card running in a v1.0 slot - my ram is pc6400 800mhz, reading at pc5300 400mhz - switching dualcore 3.4, to a core2duo 2.4 so, hoping that there will be some increase in performance for all 3 factors.  </s>
<s> enough to hold me over until the mac comes anyway.  </s>
<s> which may be another 6 months or so... since about $2500 used.  </s>
<s> :s  </s>
<s> we can't discuss osx on non-apple hardware.  </s>
<s> those discussions get an instant lock.  </s>
<s> love to work the other angles so start again but it's verboten (see forum policies.)  </s>
