<s> hi. i was hoping someone can provide me with some info on performing load balancing between two seperate isp's.  </s>
<s> i was looking for info on if this can actually be done, what type of equip i'd be looking at and maybe what this could cost.  </s>
<s> any info would be huge!! thanks.  </s>
<s> do you understand routing tables?  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i don't know really anything about routing tables.  </s>
<s> let me tell you why i'm asking.  </s>
<s> i'm looking for a solution to offer some accounts i'm working with.  </s>
<s> i wouldn't be setting this up i'd just like to know if it is possible between say a dsl connection and a cable connection and if it is a pricey option.  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> that you become adept at routing tables.  </s>
<s> if you are not ready for that, then you'll have to use pricey soltuons, i.e. those that are made for &quot;ready to use&quot; applications.&quot;  </s>
<s> once you pick up a little routing and ip knowledge, write back and see if we can sort it out with your &quot;router&quot;.  </s>
