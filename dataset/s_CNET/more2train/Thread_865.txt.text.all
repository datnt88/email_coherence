everytime i start downloading something from the internet, or start playing a video game, my computer would lose its wireless connection. 
sometimes it would even go to a black screen and my monitor would lose its connection with my computer. 
can anyone help me? 
more of a hardware problem and/or software corruption (ala spyware/virus), then a networking issue. 
check for bugs and a stressed out(overheated) cpu. 
thanks! thats probably it. 
i forgot that i took out a fan earlier. 
its probably just too hot.
