<s> i bought a gateway fpd2275w monitor and am using it with windows vista and nvidia 8800 video card. the problem i'm having is that when i turn on the monitor it takes about 5 minutes to come on to the desktop.  </s>
<s> it shows a black screen with a faint gateway word and logo then it will finally come on.  </s>
<s> i do not have the monitor driver loaded because when i did that the picture was all full of lines even with the vista updated monitor driver from gateway.  </s>
<s> so i went back to the generic monitor driver in vista.  </s>
<s> i have all the power saving options turned off.  </s>
<s> i do not have the monitor software installed as it has problems with vista.  </s>
<s> it also had the same problem with my other video card. is there a setting within the monitor itself that would keep it from coming on?  </s>
<s> i noticed that the same thing happens with the same monitor in the store displays.  </s>
<s> the salespeople don't have a clue.  </s>
<s> thanks for any and all help.  </s>
<s> who would let them keep money for this?  </s>
<s> heck, if the store display didn't work, then don't wait return it! the time in *now* to return it as store policies are far more friendlier within 15days or less.  </s>
<s> i'm sure you touched on all the issues that effect the setup, but nvidia have been a sore issue with vista.  </s>
<s> oem's are waiting still for such, plus if the monitor is not stated as vista capable it too can fall through the cracks until a later time its 100% fixed or accepted in the fold, let them fix it.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> this just happened to me after one week of use.  </s>
<s> see the forum posting description below for the exact symptom.  </s>
<s> i had to unplug the power cord as mentioned in another forum answer to &quot;reset&quot; the monitor (the monitor menu's reset option has no effect).  </s>
<s> this same thing also happened to a personal friend of mine who bought the same fpd2275w monitor around 9 months ago from circuit city.  </s>
<s> just thought you should know.  </s>
<s> maybe there is a firmware update from the manufacturer to permanently fix this? the monitor is always plugged in and even when you &quot;turn it off&quot; with the button or by vista &quot;power plan&quot; options, the power button is lit purple (the off color) so it still has external power applied to it.  </s>
<s> just surprised this happened after one week!  </s>
<s> i didn't install the vista eztune software yet because of reported issues with nvidia 8800 cards.  </s>
<s> my friend has eztune installed on his xp system and the same freeze happens so that can't be the cause.  </s>
<s> its something with the monitor hardware onboard processor itself.  </s>
<s> originally posted by (another user): &quot;i recently purchased this monitor and it just started doing something that's bothering me.  </s>
<s> when the monitor goes into power-saving mode, or i turn it off while the computer is on, it takes a loooong time to turn back on.  </s>
<s> when i turn it back on the gateway logo pops up on a black screen and just stays there for a minute.  </s>
<s> then it shows the desktop but the little blue window that shows it's connected via dvi is on the screen for another 30 seconds.  </s>
<s> so it takes a good minute and a half to actually see the desktop.  </s>
<s> it's almost like it freezes for a minute and a half.  </s>
<s> anybody else have this problem or heard of it and know how to fix it?&quot; answer (by another user): try unplugging the power then plugging it back in ... this should reset the monitor.  </s>
<s> my menu buttons dont lite or work anymore.  </s>
<s> they flickered and stoped working.  </s>
<s> as a result i get the menu screen on my display and it dont go away!! does anybody have any idea?? please help??  </s>
