<s> i want to replace my old router.  </s>
<s> my notebook (dell latitude d630) supports 802.11 b/g/n.  </s>
<s> my needs are simple: use the notebook to access my lan and the internet (cable modem to desktop).  </s>
<s> that's it.  </s>
<s> i want to take full advantage of the capabilities of the notebook's card, but i don't need the sun, the moon and the stars.  </s>
<s> i don't do gaming or watch films through the router. the max distance involved is probably less than 100 feet.  </s>
<s> i've noticed that user comments on cnet always rate routers lower than the cnet reviews, which isn't very helpful.  </s>
<s> i also want one that has better documentation and support than that provided by d-link.  </s>
<s> all come in dead even on support and documentation. the one issue i see today is they don't teach networking. is that the missing documentation?  </s>
<s> i've used d-link, netgear, and linksys.  </s>
<s> all have worked, and i've had problems with each one.  </s>
<s> a while back i got a linksys (read cisco) wrt-350n.  </s>
<s> worked until it didn't, the wireless died.  </s>
<s> before that i had a d-link something else until it died.  </s>
<s> i had the linksys repaired (under warranty).  </s>
<s> while i was waiting on it i got a d-link dir-655.  </s>
<s> both the latest linksys and d-link are gigabit wired and wireless n. the d-link is now running and the repaired linksys is still in the box.  </s>
<s> long story short, what's the best?  </s>
<s> ford or chevy.  </s>
<s> it's hard to say which one is better.  </s>
<s> i get good wired speeds and the wireless is powerful.  </s>
<s> in reality, i have found by experience that d-link has better documentation and support.  </s>
<s> when i sent questions to each one, only d-link replied in a timely manor.  </s>
<s> i even got a phone call from an email question.  </s>
<s> not saying linksys is bad, they just took too long to reply.  </s>
<s> maybe a fluke.  </s>
<s> just get a name brand.  </s>
<s> and remember this for wireless.  </s>
<s> as distance increases, speed decreases.  </s>
