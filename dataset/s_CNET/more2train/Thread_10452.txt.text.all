<s> hi, im deciding whether or not i should buy this computer, please give me all your suggestions, they are all welcome, thank you.  </s>
<s> intel core i5 750 quad core gigabyte crossfirex usb3.0 sata3 motherboard western digital caviar black 1tb sata3 6gb/s 7200rpm 64mb cache 3.5in dual proc hard drive oem samsung black dvd writer xfx radeon hd 5770 850mhz video card antec three hundred mini tower gaming case microsoft windows 7 home premium edition 64bit dvd oem ocz modxstream pro 700w atx 20/24 pin sli all this adds up with about $1,206 canadian dollars  </s>
<s> buy a machine with only one hard drive.  </s>
<s> that 1tb drive might be fine for data but i'd put the os and apps on something smaller.  </s>
<s> i'm also not seeing ram.  </s>
<s> if you're going 64 bit, you'll go 4 gigs and up.  </s>
<s> that i5 will be dual channel so 4 gigs means 2 modules minimum so figure about 100 + bucks us per set.  </s>
<s> i built a similar setup in sept 09 for about $900 us.  </s>
<s> but i had 2 ea.  </s>
<s> 500 gb sata drives along with the caviar green 1tb.  </s>
<s> i used my old case though and a 650 corsair psu along with the win 7 upgrade early release which was $49.  </s>
<s> so your prices are not far out of line, you can shop around for a little better.  </s>
<s> zipzoom, new egg and tiger are all moderately priced, sometimes you can find a deal or rebate.  </s>
<s> too high, why mini tower?  </s>
<s> i'm trying to figure out if this is a config you have setup, a system configurator (from a website, eg: newegg, tigerdirect, etc.), or a specific brand name (hp, acer, gateway, dell).  </s>
<s> if it's a system you're thinking of putting together yourself; i would definitely be looking at a larger case; the antec 300 is just too small to allow the proper ventilation you'll need to cool the cpu and videocard, also your first build should be a joy not a nightmare because the case you bought is too small for your components.  </s>
<s> as stated before, we think you forgot to include the ram, this will add some cost to your project.  </s>
<s> if this is a specific system from a manufacturer; then make sure you check their website forums for customer reviews, problems, concerns, etc. if you're looking to buy a specific setup; then you need to decide what you're going to be using the computer for (eg: photo/ video editing, gaming, etc.), then decide which components will best suit your needs.  </s>
<s> judging by the price ($1206 cad); i'm thinking you probably hail from canada-not a bad thing, if you're in the western region, try researching components from ncix, newegg.ca, or memory express.  </s>
<s> i buy all my computer components from memory express for 3 reasons; their competively priced, quality products, and the best extended warranties in the west .  </s>
<s> i don't know if you have set your mind on intel, but for $1206 you can put together a rather killer amd system  </s>
