<s> well my new pc came with a brandless psu, i never leave it on for more than a day, usually around 10 hours max i would turn it off, but i need to download something important and i need to leave it on for possibily long periods of time, something like 30 hours, so my question is: -with the bad psu on my pc, will leaving it on for 30 hours be a bad idea?  </s>
<s> luckily my pc isn't boiling....yet, and i already left it on for 12 hours, however i still need 30 more hours before i can turn it off, and i really don't want to turn it off unless i have no choice, i don't want 56k in the first place but broadband require signing a 1 year contract.... so please, give me some advice, thanks.  </s>

<s> suffice it to say...i think you're safe.  </s>

<s> but surely you have a better psu than me, because mine is just very very bad, i don't even know where it's made or its brand.  </s>
<s> i'll be blunt, if you know you have a 'bad psu' then why not replace it at the earliest convience if not sooner.  </s>
<s> many a generic brand has survived basic demands, just go for one that's higher wattage.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> the fact that you don't know the mfr and where its made is not a reason in and of itself.  </s>
<s> it might be made in china, but so what.  </s>
<s> yes the odds are high that it is not the greatest power supply but as long as it is working, why worry. the 30 hour limit is in your head. the power supply internals have reached its &quot;stable&quot; running temperature in ten or so minutes.  </s>
<s> it may vary a little as the running load on the cpu varies depending on what you are doing.  </s>
<s> it should stay in that temperature range as long as it is on.  </s>
<s> i doubt the psu will have a problem with this. if your concerned maybe remove the side cover...keep things a little cooler....doubt that it's needed.  </s>
<s> can you really keep your dial-up connection alive for 30 hrs? that must be some huge download.  </s>
