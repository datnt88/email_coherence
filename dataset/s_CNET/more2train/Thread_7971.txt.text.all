<s> i often forget to turn my printer off when i have finished using it.  </s>
<s> some more expensive printers have a &quot;sleep mode&quot; which turns them &quot;off&quot; if left &quot;inactive&quot; for a long period of time.  </s>
<s> i have been told it is a big no-no to leave a printer turned on for too long &quot;inactive&quot; because it dries the ink up.  </s>
<s> i can leave my printer on for days, completely forgetting that it is turned on.  </s>
<s> what sort of harm or damage am i doing?  </s>
<s> i really would appreciate some good constructive advice.  </s>
<s> thanking you in anticipation of a reply.  </s>

<s> the printer when active usually sits at the ready unless as you know goes into a &quot;hibernate mode&quot; or simply parks itself.  </s>
<s> this action allows it to &quot;cap&quot; the printhead in order to lessen any drying of the printhead.  </s>
<s> if your printer doesn't do this then it exposes the prthd.  </s>
<s> and starts to dry out.  </s>
<s> when turned-off it will park and come to rest on the capping mechanism preventing drying.  </s>
<s> again, if it can't do this it wull cause problems fo especially inkjets, less so for any other typical home printer.  </s>
<s> i exclude power and electrical issues.  </s>
