<s> hello, i am building a system and i am not sure what motherboard to buy.  </s>
<s> i am thinking about getting an intel motherboard core i7.  </s>
<s> i am not sure which motherboard to go for.  </s>
<s> to give you a better idea.  </s>
<s> i don't play games.  </s>
<s> i need a computer for music production.  </s>
<s> here are a few that i have been looking at evga ( item=n82e16813188049) any others you might recommend?  </s>
<s> should i go amd route?  </s>
<s> realistically, i don't want to spend over $200 if possible, but if people are for the evga then i might just do it.  </s>
<s> thank you very much for your time  </s>
<s> are considerably more expensive than socket 775 systems.  </s>
<s> not sure the extra $$ gives proportionate increase in performance for most.  </s>
<s> core i7 mbs start at $200 and go to $400 and the cpus start about $275 unless you live near a microcenter where they're sometimes on sale for $200.  </s>
<s> here's a socket 775 mb with decent rating from buyers.and it's $115 after rebate.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> do you think it is better to go to a ddr3 motherboard than a ddr2?  </s>
<s> i use music producing software and i need to make sure i can use this with out my computer bogging down.  </s>
<s> when it comes to cpu's it doesn't have to be the core i7, i will consider the ones before that as long as my computer can handle my music production software, so it doesn't bogg down my computer.  </s>
<s> then i am fine.  </s>
<s> is gigabyte motherboard the way to go?  </s>
<s> asus?  </s>
<s> evga?  </s>
<s> hello, i am building a new system and i am not sure which route to take in terms of which motherboard, processor etc. here is some info on what i am building a computer for...i am building this computer for music production and not gaming.  </s>
<s> software i use is fl studio and protools as well as plugging in instruments to the computer for recording.  </s>
<s> i need a computer system that won't bogg down when i have all these softwares and plug-ins open.  </s>
<s> i would like to get the core i7 processor, but not sure if i should go for it or not.  </s>
<s> should i go the amd route?  </s>
<s> it seems more affordable to go for the amd route.  </s>
<s> if i go with the amd i am thinking about this then comes to the motherboard.  </s>
<s> i am really not sure which one to decide on.  </s>
<s> here are a few brands i have been looking at are evga, gigabyte and asus.  </s>
<s> what about other brands like intel, foxconn, msi, dfi?  </s>
<s> when it comes to memory should i stick with ddr2 or ddr3?  </s>
<s> i have some wish list categories.  </s>
<s> jeff's computer build = stuff i already have and purchased { } jeff's future build = stuff i am thinking about buying.  </s>
<s> { } other case considerations = other cases i am thinking about.  </s>
<s> { } so, i still need motherboard, processor, sound card, memory.  </s>
<s> i am looking to spend $500 more, but no more than $600.  </s>
<s> few notes:for the case, i am leaning towards the azza solano 1000 and for the video card i bought from best buy the visiontek hd 4350 ati radeon video card, should i keep or upgrade it?  </s>
<s> for sound card people have recommended m-audio an emu for music production, what do you guys think?  </s>
<s> thank you very much for your time  </s>
<s> ok, so a quick google search on protools and fl studio show that they are multi-threaded, but, to be perfectly honest, they don't go into a lot of detail.  </s>
<s> it was literally one line in fl studios feature list and a few forum posting describing multi-threaded-ness on protools.  </s>
<s> so, i would definitely get a quad, but i think you knew that already. the part i'm debating is amd/intel quad.  </s>
<s> from my research, protools seems to work rather nicely with i7's, with a certain bench (dverbs, if you've heard of it) it gets twice the score than a q6600.  </s>
<s> if i were you, i would go i7. but, realize, you'll need ddr3.  </s>
<s> core i7 can only take ddr3, no ddr2 here.  </s>
<s> for the best performance with i7, we do want triple-channel memory.  </s>
<s> i'm not fully versed on the performance benefits from double to triple-channel, but the prices are close enough and i7 has a memory controller built for triple-channel, so why go slower?  </s>
<s> and, like i said, prices are close.  </s>
<s> do you plan to overclock?  </s>
<s> if so, i would go for one of those cases.  </s>
<s> but if you aren't, you don't *need* the cooling that those cases give and a cheaper case will suffice.  </s>
<s> but, here's the rub. the cheapest i7 is $280.  </s>
<s> an i7 motherboard will run you $200 or more, a few dipping into the high 100's.  </s>
<s> memory (6gb, triple channel) will be another $100.  </s>
<s> if you're counting right, we're at $580 and we haven't even bought the sound card, which sounds pretty important considering the tools you're using.  </s>
<s> we can dip down into intel quad's or amd's quads, but the i7 may be a bit out of your price range.  </s>
<s> both amd/intel quads are great.  </s>
<s> amd has cheaper motherboards and are a little more overclocking friendly, but intel's quads are faster per-clock than amds.  </s>
<s> a 3.2ghz amd (phenom ii 955) is a bit slower than the q9650 (3.0ghz).  </s>
<s> research your tools a bit, see what other people are using them with.  </s>
<s> some tools, unfortunately, are highly biased to one architecture or another.  </s>
<s> see if there are any anomalies there.  </s>
<s> good luck!  </s>
<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>
<s> msi x58 pro gigabyte ga-ex58-ud3r  </s>
<s> vapcmd ps...if you go i7....then expect to spend more than projected.  </s>
<s> your i7 mb is going $200-$300 .... $250-$275 for the cpu.....$100 for the ram and then there's the video card.  </s>
<s> re win7...what are planning to use 'til it becomes avialable ?  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> thank you very much for your reply.  </s>
<s> affordability and espcially i am not a gamer, i am really leaning towards amd phenom, what i mentioned in my post.  </s>
<s> i don't plan on overclocking.  </s>
<s> here is my first mock build and can be subjected to change.  </s>
<s> case wise, i am still deciding on the azzan and antec 1200.  </s>
<s> let me know your thoughts on the build so far.  </s>
<s> as for memory, what about these what do you think of the mushkin hp? [...] 6820146868 ocz [...] 6820227381 [...] 6820227365 what about the auzentech azt-forte x-fi forte 7.1 low profile pci express sound card compared to emu's, creative labs and m-audio?  </s>
<s> thanks for the links, ramarc.  </s>
<s> now only a bit more so i don't feel bad about buying one for me, lol!  </s>
<s> i just built an amd phenom system last week, though it was the dual-core version: phenom ii x2 550, 3.1ghz.  </s>
<s> thing absolutely roared; and for the price?  </s>
<s> heck yes.  </s>
<s> build looks great, though i might make a few changes: the 955 is the fastest phenom available,true, but you're definitely paying quite a premium for it.  </s>
<s> if it were up to me, i would go for the 940.  </s>
<s> it's at 3.0ghz instead of the 955's 3.2ghz.  </s>
<s> but, it is still a black edition cpu, meaning it has an unlocked multiplier.  </s>
<s> that means it is dead-simple to overclock.  </s>
<s> i would get the phenom ii 940, save $56, go into your bios and change the multiplier from 15 to 16. bam: you get a 955 for free.  </s>
<s> i highly doubt you'll have to do any voltage tweaks at all.  </s>
<s> no need to fuss with memory multipliers or htt multipliers: change one number and you're golden.  </s>
<s> i would personally change the ram to this: what do you get for an extra $5? tighter timings (cas6 versus cas8) and cool lights!  </s>
<s> check out the video review in it's review section.  </s>
<s> cas latency isn't a big performance gain, but it can help, especially in memory-intensive applications.  </s>
<s> not sure if yours falls under that.  </s>
<s> but, darn, those lights are too cool.  </s>
<s> now we have to get a case with a window, lol! the links you posted are truncated; they've been cut short.  </s>
<s> can you try pasting them again?  </s>
<s> i'm the wrong guy to ask about sound cards: i use onboard and can't tell the difference since the day i threw out my creative card.  </s>
<s> i will tell you this, though: the x-fi chipset is mainly targeted toward gamers and the like.  </s>
<s> e-mu and m-audio are targeted for professionals.  </s>
<s> i'd just go with the one that fits your budget and (more importantly) has all the connections you'll need.  </s>
<s> and then some.  </s>
<s> you realize these are full-towers, right?  </s>
<s> i have a coolermaster stacker 830 (big boy, trust me) and it's huge.  </s>
<s> like, no mid-tower compares.  </s>
<s> just trust me.  </s>
<s> think big. then go two more steps.  </s>
<s> that's a full tower.  </s>
<s> in my opinion, i'd go with the azza.  </s>
<s> never heard of them, but it has good reviews.  </s>
<s> you get a bigger side fan and it's a whole lot cheaper.  </s>
<s> and who doesn't love 230mm fans?! good luck!  </s>
<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>
<s> hi ibrahim, the links i have posted are working.  </s>
<s> i am not sure if you tried clicking on them.  </s>
<s> here they are again.  </s>
<s> jeff's computer build = stuff i already have and purchased { } jeff's future build = stuff i am thinking about buying.  </s>
<s> { } other case considerations = other cases i am thinking about.  </s>
<s> { } thank you for the cpu insight.  </s>
<s> i will look into it.  </s>
<s> yeah, i realize it is a full tower case.  </s>
<s> i measured it and yes it is larger than my mid tower, but the only difference is the height, which is 16 on my midtower and 22 on the full tower.  </s>
<s> yes it is taller, but still fits in my work space.  </s>
<s> my mid tower is 20 is length or width what ever you call it and 8 inches from side to side. on the ones i picked it is about the same as those dimensions.  </s>
<s> should work out ok. if it turns out to be too big for my tastes, can i return to new egg with out a problem?  </s>
<s> i will check out as well.  </s>
<s> thank you again for your help.  </s>
<s> any thing else let me know.  </s>
<s> i should have some questions in a bit.  </s>
<s> i was actually referring to the ram you linked me, but i still like the one's i linked, unless you need a lower price?  </s>
<s> oh, yeah.  </s>
<s> newegg has a fantastic rma program.  </s>
<s> i'd much rather deal with newegg than a company.  </s>
<s> i looked through the case choices again and i really like the azza. the others are too expensive, imo, for what you get, but i'm not one to talk with a $220 case.  </s>
<s> but the azza looks like it has the good stuff: removable mobo tray, good fans, nice exterior design.  </s>
<s> it isn't tool-less, but i find the trusting reassurance of a tightened screw a bit more satisfying than the promise of wimpy plastic.  </s>
<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>
<s> thank you once again.  </s>
<s> sweet.  </s>
<s> i am going to get the azza case.  </s>
<s> those ram's are for intel motherboards, so i am no longer looking at those.  </s>
<s> i thought about that too.  </s>
<s> yeah, tooless is easier, but those thumb screws are not bad either.  </s>
<s> so, this looks like my final build .  </s>
<s> i will make my final decision by the weekend for sure.  </s>
<s> if you or anyone else has any recomendations please let me know.  </s>
<s> thanks again.  </s>
<s> it looks good.  </s>
<s> ram, actually, isn't &quot;for&quot; a certain brand.  </s>
<s> ram will work as long as it has the same subsystem (ddr2, ddr3, etc) in any system.  </s>
<s> speeds don't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo (spd) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs.  </s>
<s> looks nice from my end.  </s>
<s> ~ibrahim~  </s>
<s> it looks like i will need to upgrade my operating system from xp professsional to a 64 bit operating system, so i can take full advantage of the memory.  </s>
<s> which one should i consider windows xp professional 64 bit windows vista pro 64 bit windows 7 rc 64 bit thank you.  </s>
<s> but the big issue for most is drivers.  </s>
<s> in order from most lacking in my experience (drivers from makers) is this order.  </s>
<s> 1. (don't expect drivers from maker) windows 7 rc 64 bit 2. (hit and miss support from makers) windows xp professional 64 bit 3. (can usually find or get an answer about the driver) windows vista pro 64 bit after 7 ships you can  </s>
<s> after 7 ships then you can ask the makers for drivers.  </s>
<s> for now i've found in many cases the vista driver works (if there is one.)  </s>
<s> so, you think i should just upgrade to vista 64 then?  </s>
<s> and if you preorder the win7 upgrade now, it will only cost $99.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> $149.99 vapcmd  </s>
<s> thank you.  </s>
<s> i am hoping to make a decsion on my system by the end of the weekend.  </s>
<s> when you said: &quot;speeds don't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo (spd) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs.&quot;  </s>
<s> how do you do that?  </s>
<s> how do you adjust the specs to get the actuals?  </s>
<s> i think i will order the discounted windows 7 and download the windows 7 64bit rc for free.  </s>
<s> i won't do it until i check with my software specs to see if it can.  </s>
<s> i havn't had time to do it yet.  </s>
<s> i won't count out the windows vista either.  </s>
<s> i have to think about it further.  </s>
<s> hello everyone, i have decided on the core i7.  </s>
<s> i found a great deal at microcenter for $199, so that was the decider.  </s>
<s> some of you who recommended things to me, i am not sure if some of them will be right for the core i7. if you can update your recommendations, i would appreciate it.  </s>
<s> i will reread as well.  </s>
<s> i now need to pick a motherboard for the i7, memory, sound card etc. i will update in a few.  </s>
<s> if you have any recommendations, please don't hesitate to tell.  </s>
<s> i am trying to make my decision by tonight or tomorrow morning the latest.  </s>
<s> here is a link to my final build thanks again.  </s>
<s> i will update again.  </s>
<s> what gpu are you using ?? vapcmd  </s>
<s> i bought from best buy the visiontek ati radeon 4350.  </s>
<s> i know we talked about this, but i want to finalize my decision.  </s>
<s> sorry if i am repeating here.  </s>
<s> which vista would you recommend i go for and why?  </s>
<s> vista home premium 64bit $109.99 vista business 64bit $149.99 vista ultimate 64bit $189.99  </s>
<s> i have made a category list for you all to see.  </s>
<s> please click on the links below to see the categories.  </s>
<s> these are just a few items that i have either been recommended or came across of.  </s>
<s> i will be adding more.  </s>
<s> please let me know, which one you like.  </s>
<s> i will go with the product with the most votes.  </s>
<s> sound card list memory list video card list motherboard list also, i might need to get a heatsink or cooler, if you think i need to get one which one should i get?  </s>
<s> thank you all again.  </s>
<s> the win 7 free upgrade is &quot;win 7 business&quot; vice &quot;win 7 home premium&quot;.  </s>
<s> vapcmd  </s>
<s> another update.  </s>
<s> i bought the window7 prof upgrade from amazon.com because i happened to get the promotion price at $99 upgrade of win 7. since i decided to late, i wasn't able to get the deal thru newegg.com.  </s>
<s> i happended to put it in the shopping cart before it expired and happened to go back to amazon.com and i realized it was still there.  </s>
<s> so, done deal.  </s>
<s> i will go with the rc version and once i get the retail version of win 7 i will upgrade from there.  </s>
<s> one thing i am not sure about is, which it doesn't state on the website that if it is 64 bit or not.  </s>
<s> does win 7 come in both 32 or 64 bit?  </s>
<s> i will probably have to send an email to amazon.com to find out.  </s>
<s> so, once again i am going to go with the windows 7 rc version.  </s>
<s> i have heard enough good stuff about it that i am willing to go this route.  </s>
<s> unless, somebody has a different suggestion.  </s>
<s> thank you again.  </s>
<s> not easy to pick ram when you don't know which mb, ram quantity or ram speed.  </s>
<s> that said ...if the mb has 6 dimm slots supportng triple channel, you might add the one below to your list.  </s>
<s> you definitely want to purchase and install the total ram you plan to use upfront, not some now and some later.  </s>
<s> as far as socket 1366 mbs are concerned ... i don't see any at any price that are obvious, no-brainer choices ergo the reason i initially suggested the socket 775 mbs.  </s>
<s> good luck, vapcmd  </s>
<s> thank you all for your help so far.  </s>
<s> i am starting a new thread to help finalize my build.  </s>
<s> check it out and whenever you get a chance, please give me your final thoughts.  </s>
<s> sorry if this is repetitive, but i am doing this because it will help me finalize my thoughts.  </s>
<s> new thread - jeff  </s>
<s> it's in the bios, memory options.  </s>
