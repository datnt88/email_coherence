<s> periodically, my ethernet connection drops on my macbook -- 2.16 ghz intel core 2 duo, 4gb memory, 10.5.8. i also have a imac and a thinkpad hooked up to the same router, and they never experience this problem. the router is a linksys wrt54g2 v1 with firmware: dd-wrt v24-sp2 (01/01/09) micro-plus. the outage seems to happen most frequently when i am doing a large file transfer or watching online video.  </s>
<s> this used to happen every few days, now it is happening more and more frequently.  </s>
<s> after it goes down, the port seems to close and i need to restart the machine to restore its ability to connect to the internet.  </s>
<s> where should i begin?  </s>
<s> (it is not the cable, for starters...)  </s>
<s> 1. another machine on that cable.  </s>
<s> 2. if it is your machine, post in one of the apple forums for ideas about os repairs.  </s>
<s> if you enabled a firewall in the apple, reconsider your choice.  </s>
<s> thanks, tried my thinkpad on the cable, it works fine.  </s>
<s> connect with wifi.  </s>
<s> is this a solution?  </s>
<s> or will this help diagnosis the problem?  </s>
<s> if the former -- i actually want to fix this problem, not circumvent it.  </s>
<s> if you want it fixed, take it to the apple repair counter.  </s>
<s> you have proved to me it's that machine.  </s>
<s> as it could be a board issue and you demand a fix then let's get to the right counter.  </s>
<s> otherwise try the cnet apple forums and ask about the os repair.  </s>
<s> then again i've run into folk that demand to know if that will fix it.  </s>
<s> for the demanding types you have to go back to what will absolutely fix it.  </s>
<s> that is the apple repair counter or a new machine.  </s>
