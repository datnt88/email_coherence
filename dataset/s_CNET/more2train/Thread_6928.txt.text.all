<s> i have an epson workforce 630.  </s>
<s> i am using it to temporarily replace our main office copier/fax machine until its repaired.  </s>
<s> initially i could not send or receive faxes, but then i was instructed to turn off error correcting mode (ecm) and turn off v.3.4.  </s>
<s> after i did this i was able to receive faxes and i was able to send a test fax to epson which they received, but when i try to fax to other numbers it does not go through.  </s>
<s> any ideas as to why this might happen?  </s>
<s> i've found some machines will not work with each other and the fax does not go through.  </s>
<s> you may find folk that demand an answer but the simple truth is &quot;it does not always work.&quot;  </s>

<s> actually, from my point of view you make a big problem of this.  </s>
<s> it's much more easier to use an online service for this stuff.  </s>
<s> like for example - those are great guys.  </s>
<s> they just give you everything you need about faxes and they have really low prices and a free trial period, so... you can just try it.  </s>
<s> i looked at the site and did not find one word about the problems folk have with fax.  </s>
<s> this issue is not new, but when you have a product to sell, you may not want to talk about the problem areas.  </s>
