im thinking about selling my pc and i need an appraisal. 
is there any software out there to scan my system and tell me the value? 
compaq presario sr1426nx intel pentium 4 2.93ghz 2.25gb ram nvidia geforce fx 5500 256 vram 140gb hard drive windows vista ultimate 
that exact system, roughly $200-$350 at most 
i'd tag it as the cost of vista plus 200 to 300. 
but that's a little rich given ready to use machines are less than that. 
here's my thought. 
keep the vista for your next machine and install your prior os on it?
