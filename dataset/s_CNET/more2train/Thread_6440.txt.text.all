<s> i recently picked up an imation flash drive.  </s>
<s> it's advertised as 8gb, but windows only shows 7.52gb of available space.  </s>
<s> so i called imation and asked them what was up with that.  </s>
<s> they indicated that was normal, so i asked them why they advertised it as an 8gb drive if it really wasn't. the tech assured me it was an 8gb drive, so i asked him, if i tried to transfer 8gb of data to the drive, would it hold it?  </s>
<s> he said, &quot;no.&quot; sound like false advertising to you?  </s>
<s> sure does to me. is this standard for all flash drives, and if so, why?  </s>
<s> windows calculates it differently so all we need to do is do the math.  </s>
<s> nothing wrong here.  </s>
<s> let's look at your kilo watt hours on your bill.  </s>
<s> kilo = 1000 and not 1024.  </s>
<s> there are some that want that to change but in a nutshell.  </s>
<s> kilo = 1000 giga = 1,000,000,000 you see where this is going?  </s>
<s> formatting requires space.  </s>
<s> imagine a book with 300 pages.  </s>
<s> it has a title page, an index, appendix, maybe a glossary, and there has to be space for pages numbers.  </s>
<s> a certain number of pages have to devoted to keeping track of where data is located.  </s>
<s> it's the same way with your flash drive.  </s>
<s> a certain amount of those 8 gb are dedicated to keeping track of where everything is located.  </s>
