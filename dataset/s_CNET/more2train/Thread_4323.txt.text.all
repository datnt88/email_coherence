<s> hello, my problem is my pc is turning it self off in the middle of playing games and using other programs.  </s>
<s> i used my scanner today and while i was using one of the programs that came with my scanner my pc just turned it self off.  </s>
<s> i had to turn off the power supply to my surge protect and then wait a minute and turn the surge protector back on.  </s>
<s> then i can push the power button and start the pc. c drive has 15gb and 6.65gb used d has 54.8gb used and 44.9 used.  </s>
<s> i have 512mb of ram.  </s>
<s> i have a vaio and the hard drive is already formated with 15 for c and 54 for d. two days ago i uninstalled a program that i got from cnet.  </s>
<s> this program is call power dvd burner.  </s>
<s> it sent my computer into a blue fatal when i rebooted it.  </s>
<s> i had to restore the c drive because it would not let me into normal or safe mode.  </s>
<s> my pc did not start doing this until i uninstalled this program.  </s>
<s> i have deleted all but the necessary programs like ms office,adobe, and real player.  </s>
<s> i did download a bunch of updates from microsoft.  </s>
<s> i also updated net framework 1.1 to 3.0.  </s>
<s> i download only to the d drive but the updates automatically download to the c and sometimes other programs i load still want to download a little of themselves to c. i read an article that said sometimes the battery or power supply could cause problems like this.  </s>
<s> i don't want to replace part after part.  </s>
<s> i don't think it is worth that consider the age of the pc. any suggestion as to what is happening to my system?  </s>
<s> i feel i need a new one.  </s>
<s> it is barely 3 years old.  </s>
<s> but i rather junk it then rebuild it completely.  </s>
<s> my pc is running xp home edition.  </s>
<s> even at 1 year dust and lint can build up to cause heat shutdowns.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> i talk about the download processing, u can set your download destination folder by change &quot;my document&quot; path by setting: 1)right click on my document 2)choose tab: change target 3)then browse to a new folder.  </s>
<s> 4)ok reagard.  </s>
<s> age is just about 3 years.  </s>
<s> what are you suggesting?  </s>
<s> opening the pc and dusting?  </s>
<s> i know you can change the destination for other files but what about updates from windows.  </s>
<s> when the updates are done downloading windows update ask you to restart.  </s>
<s> these updates are taking up a lot of space.  </s>
<s> and some programs like the game the sims want to still download some to the c drive.  </s>
<s> if you say no it shuts the game down and will not allow the game to be installed.  </s>
<s> i don't have the game on my system at this time because it is not a necessary program right now.  </s>
<s> at minimum i've always noted yearly.  </s>
<s> so if it hasn't been done and the fans checked you're likely getting close to the cause.  </s>
