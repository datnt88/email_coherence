hello, my problem is my pc is turning it self off in the middle of playing games and using other programs. 
i used my scanner today and while i was using one of the programs that came with my scanner my pc just turned it self off. 
i had to turn off the power supply to my surge protect and then wait a minute and turn the surge protector back on. 
then i can push the power button and start the pc. c drive has 15gb and 6.65gb used d has 54.8gb used and 44.9 used. 
i have 512mb of ram. 
i have a vaio and the hard drive is already formated with 15 for c and 54 for d. two days ago i uninstalled a program that i got from cnet. 
this program is call power dvd burner. 
it sent my computer into a blue fatal when i rebooted it. 
i had to restore the c drive because it would not let me into normal or safe mode. 
my pc did not start doing this until i uninstalled this program. 
i have deleted all but the necessary programs like ms office,adobe, and real player. 
i did download a bunch of updates from microsoft. 
i also updated net framework 1.1 to 3.0. 
i download only to the d drive but the updates automatically download to the c and sometimes other programs i load still want to download a little of themselves to c. i read an article that said sometimes the battery or power supply could cause problems like this. 
i don't want to replace part after part. 
i don't think it is worth that consider the age of the pc. any suggestion as to what is happening to my system? 
i feel i need a new one. 
it is barely 3 years old. 
but i rather junk it then rebuild it completely. 
my pc is running xp home edition. 
even at 1 year dust and lint can build up to cause heat shutdowns.

i talk about the download processing, u can set your download destination folder by change &quot;my document&quot; path by setting: 1)right click on my document 2)choose tab: change target 3)then browse to a new folder. 
4)ok reagard. 
age is just about 3 years. 
what are you suggesting? 
opening the pc and dusting? 
i know you can change the destination for other files but what about updates from windows. 
when the updates are done downloading windows update ask you to restart. 
these updates are taking up a lot of space. 
and some programs like the game the sims want to still download some to the c drive. 
if you say no it shuts the game down and will not allow the game to be installed. 
i don't have the game on my system at this time because it is not a necessary program right now. 
at minimum i've always noted yearly. 
so if it hasn't been done and the fans checked you're likely getting close to the cause.
