<s> i've got a hd tv (hd ready (720p / 1080i) ) and i have it hooked up to normal tv, and then i have a agp cable coming from my pc (ati radeon hd 3650) to the agp port on the tv. thing is when i'm watching video on it, i get black lines moving up the screen.  </s>
<s> and i don't like it.  </s>
<s> currently i had a dvi to agp converter for the cable, but i was wondering, if i got a dvi to hdmi converter instead, and plugged into the hdmi port of the tv, would i get a better picture quality?  </s>
<s> your agp card doesn't have agp output port.  </s>
<s> what does the manual say about output ports that you have.  </s>
<s> if you have a dvi output connection, then all you need a is a cable that has dvi connector in one end and hdmi connector on the other end.  </s>
<s> did you mean vga?  </s>
<s> pc to tv? agp?  </s>
<s> if you are just trying to use your big screen as a monitor, vga should be fine, dvi to dvi should be a bit better, which means not a converter but a cable.  </s>
<s> hdmi encompasses both video and audio so in order to take advantage of those functions you would need an hdmi card in the pc and of course and hdmi cable.  </s>
<s> there can be a lot of variables, depending on what you are trying to do and system capability (computer) can have a lot to do with the outcome.  </s>
