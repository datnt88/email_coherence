<s> am i the only one to notice a jump in the pixel count of digital cameras?  </s>
<s> it was not long ago that i bought my first camera with 2mp count.  </s>
<s> this was just an entry level device but still considered reasonable.  </s>
<s> upgrading to a 4mp camera was quite expensive but i did eventually do it.  </s>
<s> but now when i see cameras advertised the cheapest are 5 to 6mp.  </s>
<s> i am sure technology has not accelerated that much in such a short time (measured in months rather than years).are  </s>
<s> they using a different measurement for the pixel count now?  </s>
<s> interpolation comes to mind.  </s>
<s> i picked up a kodak 6mp refurb with 3x optical zoom for only 139 and it's not interpolated.  </s>
<s> as the swing to digital accelerates, ecomonies of scale kick in and you'll find some deals out there.  </s>
<s> my advice?  </s>
<s> stick with names.  </s>

<s> ...why you're sure a modern and new technology doesn't leap upwards quickly, and we'll explain why you're surely wrong!  </s>
<s> : charge coupled device developements plenty of detail in the links you'll find, to explain why things are advancing so rapidly.  </s>
