<s> i'm planning on purchasing a black macbook.  </s>
<s> i'm on a tight scheldule so i decided to get the 512mb ram one with a 80gb hard drive.  </s>
<s> the only problem is that the apple website doesnt show it.  </s>
<s> amazon before had it for sale and now it went missing.  </s>
<s> so my question is if apple actually sell a black macbook with 512mb of ram with a 80gb and if not, where is a legit place with the best price?  </s>
<s> thanks candice  </s>
<s> 1 gig memory and double layer super drive is worth the investment... and i would never recommend getting the non-super drive units... all the &quot;legit&quot; places will typically have the same price - if you do find it.  </s>
<s> if the price looks too good to be true, it is probably a scam.  </s>
<s> you've seen them update the macbook and the old units fade away.  </s>
<s> there is often no price increase but you get more for the same buck.  </s>
<s> the current offering is what you really want for ram and the other items.  </s>
