i have room for only one pci gpu. which is best overall? is the 1gb gpu as good as it seems? what power supply should i get as well? 1)  2)  3)  4)
the 1gb card can help in some games, but not enough to justify the price you listed. you can get an 8800gts/512 for $210. if extra cooling is important to you: xfx 8800gt/512, $177:  if company of heroes appeals to you: xfx 8800gt/512, $188:  if you don't mind rebates: asus 8800gt/512, $173 before $30 rebate:  if you don't mind rebates and the extra cash: ecx 8800gts/512, $226 before $50 rebate:  a good 500w power supply is fine for all 3.
thanks
