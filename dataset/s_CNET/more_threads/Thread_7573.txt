1	1	260304	2562395	2562407	kees bakker	8/14/07 3:26 am	1.18706196e12	can you clarify?	- what do you mean with &quot;recognize&quot;? - can you read existing dvd's, in other words: are it only blank media that give trouble? kees

1	5	260304	2562871	2562483	grimgraphix	8/14/07 2:20 pm	1.1871012e12	good to know...	i was not aware of such a short life span for dvd burner drives. i have a cd burner which has lasted 5 years without a hiccup. is that aby-normal or is it just a common difference between the two types of technology? thanks for the tip about the drive showing wear and tear bob. grim
