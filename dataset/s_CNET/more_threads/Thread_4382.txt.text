i write programs in visual basic 6. some of the comands do not work and bring up erros such as variables are invalid and undeclared when i know just the opposite is true. can any one tell me of a good software program that will check out my cpu to see if it works right?
&quot;note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.? vapcmd
look into &quot;sandra lite&quot; to burn-in or test the system. here's a link:  to get that file but also check there for similar pgms. or more intense cpu testers. imho, if the systems boots up and runs well with other pgms., it may not be the cpu at fault. but, you gave no system details, so support via myself is fleeing. tada -----willy
a 'bad' cpu won't boot windows, draw images on the screen, load visual studio, and then decide to wig out only on your vb code.
supplied, is your vb version compatible with the operating system you are running. read the note: in red when posting.
