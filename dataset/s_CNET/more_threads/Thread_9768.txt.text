i have a 5-year old dell dimension e521 with an internal dvd+-rw ts-h653a scsi cdrom device and i run vista. the empty disc drawer opens for no reason and when i shut it it just keeps opening. it almost always begins happening at pc startup (before i'm even in windows) and continues sporadically no matter what programs i'm running (mostly ie and word). i've run avg, malwarebytes, superantispyware (all free versions) and defragmenter, with no change. any suggestions? thanks in advance.
unplug the data cable from the back of the optical unit. if it still opens......replace the optical unit.....20 buck item.
since this happens before you even get to windows, that suggests a h/w problem. the other poster is right, just replace the drive, you probably have no recourse to fix it. i would think this is a broken or jammed sw. at tray door. since, this is intermittent, then likely a broken sw.. you can reseat the data cable if you like or replace. be sure if you buy new, replace with similar type drive as in eide or sata type. you could borrow an used drive and see if it repeats action. tada -----willy
what is a sw? and i see no cable relating to the dvd drive; it's internal. are you all talking about taking the pc apart?
yes, to unplug the data cable from the drive you have to remove the cover on 99% of desktop pcs.
in this instance, sw = switch. my reference for s/w = software h/w = hardware dell e521 is a desktop pc, then you need to crack it open. dell provides the info to do this, just surf for your model# at dell support or enter your service tag# to get the required info. you need to know, because if you have to replace the drive, that's the action you'll later do. it's not hard imho, at all just be careful and take due diligence. tada -----willy
