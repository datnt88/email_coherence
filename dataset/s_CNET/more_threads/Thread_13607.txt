9735	4	241018	2447233	2447142	ray harinec	4/1/07 11:10 am	1.1754258e12	the audio looks good	because you will have the p695express chipset. appears that any cpu will serve, but i hope that you buy core 2 duo using the conroe core. pentiums and d's run much hotter and do not perform nearly as well.
9735	5	241018	2447286	2447142	ray harinec	4/1/07 11:44 am	1.17542784e12	sorry, mobo = lazy me for motherboard or mainboard.	no sata is faster, however if you plan to use your old pata atapi [cd drives etc] you would have to buy sata versions of them. somewhere in these forums robert proffitt had said something about xp having problems handling sata atapi [optical,burners, or call them anything that you want, drives]. believe it or not over the years the performanc speed of serial busses has passed the parallel, due to noise problems with parallel wiring at higher speeds. seems funny when you find that pci express use a bidirectional serial bus [2 lanes per] and the x 16 has 32 lanes [in parallel?? don't ask me. lol]. these busses use self clocking which also eliminates the clocking problem of bits in 32 wires next to each other. just be sure to check whether your mobo has any pata ports and if it doesn't will you still be happy. i guess that without one you can buy a pci card with two ports [4 drives].
