i have a five-year-old neovo x-174 tft display that worked fine until a few days ago, when it began emitting a nasty burning odor. is it worth it to have a monitor this old repaired? how long are flat-panel monitors supposed to last, anyway? david
here they are 120 per hour. 17 inch lcds (new) are spotted for not much more on newegg.com and geeks.com so at 5 years i'll write that you should go shopping. bob
it turned out the smell wasn't coming from the monitor, but from a rotting dead gecko that had met its demise in the fan of the computer directly underneath the monitor. yuck.
i can't believe the gecko died. we never got to know him personally. i wonder what geico will do now.
