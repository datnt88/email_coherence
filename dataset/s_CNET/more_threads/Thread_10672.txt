12373	17	122749	1411586	1391565	anapro	9/9/05 4:34 pm	1.12628364e12	dvi is better	i have a viewsonic vp201m monitor and i can easily see the diffenece between an analog and dvi connection. the dvi produces a much crisper display. others apparently have different results, but i am sold on dvi. like you, i find it irritating that not all monitor manufacturers include the dvi cable. i got an nec monitor for my daughter and it only had the analog cable. i did find a good deal on dvi cables by looking on e-bay. some are as low as $8 including shipping costs. good luck.
