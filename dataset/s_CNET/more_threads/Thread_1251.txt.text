i found this on sale for $175. i already have a laptop and just want a &quot;desktop&quot; for general purposes. is this a good deal? windows vista os intel celeron d352 cpu 512 ddrii ram 160gb sata hdd slot-in dvd rw optical
it has no dual core cpu and the 2gb ram you want to see vista work well. i'd not waste my money. bob
i think you will regret buying it. it would of been a different story a few years ago, but with the current technological advances and higher-end multi-core cpus becoming increasingly cheaper, you might think twice about acquiring a system that is quite inferior to today's standards. but if you intend to stick with xp or use a linux distribution that utilises low-end hardware, then the pc might get the job done. but if you want vista, even basic, it will be a constant struggle. and with the ridiculously low amount of ram, working with multiple apps is going to slow things down a lot. steven
in a nutshell, nope.
