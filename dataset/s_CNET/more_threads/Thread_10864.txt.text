i just got a gigabyte ep45-ud3p motherboard, and was going to install an oem splash screen, using the included utility that came with the motherboard. i ran the utility, and windows bluescreened on me. when i turn it on, the computer says: award bootblock bios v1.0 copyright (c) 2000, award software, inc. and then it just hangs. any tips? it won't do anything from there.
now it says: scanning bios image in hard drive... bios auto-recovering it has been at this for 20 minutes with no luck
it's amazing what happens when you remove all ide drives...
bios recovery features not found on other mbs. vapcmd
