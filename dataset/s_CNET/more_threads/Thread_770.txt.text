my printer has suddenly decided to cut off items that i print from the internet or emails. sometimes it's just the first couple of letters on the left side, other times it can be 3 to 5 words on the left side. i don't know why it is doing this and i have tried and checked everything i can think of to get it to print everything. there must be something i'm overlooking and if anyone can help me i'd sure appreciate it! i use windows 98 on an ibm clone.
this topic is widely discussed. you use landscape or see if a zoom feature is available. nothing is broken, it just never worked proper. bob
sometimes the toner winds up on 1 side of the developer unit, and effectively runs out on 1 end. to check to see if that's the case, try removing the developer and gently shaking it horizontally to redistribute the toner. if it works, good, but your cartridge may be running low on toner.
