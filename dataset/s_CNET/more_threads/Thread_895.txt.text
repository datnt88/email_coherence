my epson stylus c-62 printer has recently started printing only part of a page, even if i print a multiple page document, i get only the top part of the pages- sometimes just a few lines, sometimes half the page, sometimes two thirds of a page. this happens no matter what my source is, word, notepad, internet, it does not matter. it worked fine when i was using windows 98, i recently upgraded to windows xp. i can't remember if it started when i changed over or if it was awhile after. my pc is a dell pentium 4,with alot of ram and a large hard drive. i have tried everything. please help.
2. please contact me via my profile. i have a few spare ink carts for the c62 bob
here is the website for the newer drivers, etc for the c-62  it could also be that there has been a problem for the printer. if the new drivers do not solve the problem, i would explore a different printer as the c-62 is getting old.
