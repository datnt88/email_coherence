(note: i had created a 3 user accounts) the other 2 seems to work fine. i had disable the automatic re-boot, and a blue screen is presented with the problem messages. one of the recommendation is to get the windows update. and i am doing it now. i will continue to monitor if the problem still persists. afterwhich, i will perhaps install xp sp2. and hopefully it could solve the problem. i will keep you posted of the development. by the way, i had another piece of the 40gb hard disk, and i had tried to reinstall xp. and it just hang and give me a blue screen with similar error messages. hence, i don't think reinstalling would help. and thank you for taking the trouble to give me all the advice. gl
