i have no local c: or d: drives visible in disk management, nor nero backitup 3 nor ghost 14. but i boot okay and they are visible in windows explorer. i have an xp sp3 hp mediacenter 3.2 ghz, 2 gb ram, raid 1 230 gb hard drives. interestingly enough, when i boot up in safe mode diskmanager shows c: & d:! thank you.

thank you very much - it was indeed the logical disk manager administrative service that wasn't started. unfortunately nero backitup 3 doesn't show any local drive and ghost 14 is still having trouble seeing c:. here's a sample: -cannot create a virtual volume image of the selected drive. --error e0bc0002: object sme~computer~bgmcab10beeregion-0~vmcab10beeregion-0-1 not found.
since that service is not disabled by default, are there any clues as to how it got turned off? for example a recent machine i worked on had the usual trojan attack and what we finally had to do was save files and start over. not that we couldn't fix it but at what price? just like most of us when we take it to the shop there is a price per hour of work and at 4 hours just to get things all cleaned up and almost back to a normal windows the remaining items would take a call to microsoft and &quot;please hold&quot; and &quot;credit card please.&quot; i can't tell how the machine get to be this way. bob
