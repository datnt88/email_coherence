ive done much research on both. i am leaning towards emachines because of the built in tuner...can anyone tell me what brand it is and the quality? if its total garbage i can get the hp. also is there the ability to add another dvd drive if you choose in the emachines? i am concerned over emachines qulaity vs hp....any feedback would be appreciated.
i think its a bette buy. as for the tv tuner, i am not sure but since gateway owns emachines, and i have an 820gm, its an aver media or aver tech something. there is nothing wrong with hp either. either way you go, you will have a good pc. konny
you can add another drive, but itll look really weird because the front of the case is round. have to buy from emachines...
