i have a 256 mb of pci video card inside my computer and it works fine. i wanted to know if my computer can go up to 512 mb. can my computer can go up to at least 512 mb of a video card?
i read  to pick a price and then the card... since the card holds that ram, the video card sets the limit, not the pc.
so basically my motherboard can handle at least 512 mb of the video?
sorry if i was unclear. the motherboard holds the video card. the video card holds the video ram. so only the video card sets the limit. bob
