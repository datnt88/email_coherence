i really enjoy bass but i don't necessarily need my teeth chattering. i want to hear and feel the thump from the bass but not so heavy that it drowns out the mids and highs. ive done some research but i get mixed reviews on whether or not the gigaworks can provide a clean heavy bass (not exactly sub-woofer quality but still great). also klipsch is a known high quality brand and i'm hoping to use these speakers for a long time. if anyone here has owned or heard both i would love your input, if you haven't then any advice can help.
i've also selected the bose companion 2 series 2 as a possibility.
promedia 2.1 and it's served me well for quite some time. i don't game but i do enjoy music at reasonable quality. it's really a matter of adjusting the bass to the right level as any sub-woofer can get muddy sounding. my main home speaker system is still a pair of old jbl l65s ( a studio monitor series) that spoils me but the klipsch are nice on my pc. i don't need or want more than 2.1. good luck in your search but it's your ears that should do the judging.
