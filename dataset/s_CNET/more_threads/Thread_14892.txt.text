how long would it take to format 2 samsung spinpoint f3 hard drives in raid 0 with the dod short method in dban?
what you find is this has no reliable answer because of all the variables. why isn't a quick format usable? bob
the process is a time-consuming task. i wouldn't think you want to wait. however, i suggest you do this before going to bed or after/before your work day. drink you soda or coffee and do something else. and beware it may not seem like it's doing anything but provided you launched the process, check the &quot;progress gauge&quot; to be sure it shows 1%(after some time) before walking away. tada -----willy
