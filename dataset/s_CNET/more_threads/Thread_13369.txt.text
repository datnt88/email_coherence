please help and guide me to solve my computer problems. i use it when a block out(out of electricity) happen that moment, the reason to accidentally shutdown my unit and wont start after the connection of electricity is back, maybe some of the software were corrupted at that moment of shutting down. can you give me an advice how to repair the corrupted software and start my computer same as last time i use?
so the advice has to be generic. 1. restore from your last backup. 2. if your os allows os repair, try that. same for apps. bob
os- win xp service pack 2 pc- pentium 4 socket 478. 2.2 ghz of speed and 1.2 ram i try to use the back door which is the safemode, but still as usual. i can't repair it...
so you need to do a repair from the os cd. do you have that ready? kees
the google search for this uses the following words: xp repair install
