so i just set up my alcatel speedtouch usb adsl modem, which is is connected to my laptop. but, i also have a smc 7004vwbr 4 port wireless router and would like to get all our laptops in my house connected to wireless. is this wireless router compatible with my speedtouch ucb adsl modem? will i be able to set up a wireless system in my house, so that all the laptops w/wireless cards can access the internet? what do i do next? i'm clueless! or, do i have to resort to buying a combo adsl wireless router/modem? many thanks, jenny
&quot;is this wireless router compatible with my speedtouch ucb adsl modem?&quot; no. your adsl modem must have an ethernet port. no. i haven't seen a wireless router that will use an usb adsl modem. bob
if i buy one of those new adsl wirless router/modem combo will i have to have one of our laptops turned on and running the whole time? and will this be a fairly easy set up, as in i just have to plug this wireless router/modem into the phone line correct? thanks so much! jenny
i would not buy such a device. i do buy the occasional dsl or cable modem and use the router to share such. stories abound about the wonder boxes and firmware issues so i just don't buy such. bob
