okay! after much research and consideration, i have decided to give my poorly outdated agp system another go before i upgrade to pci-e. the question is: what is a reasonable agp graphics cards? i know the nvidia 7800gs is pretty much the best one out there, but after reading about how unstable it can be on the newegg review's i'm unsure. has anyone else had problems with it? also, any other agp cards you guys recommend? thanks!
what do you want to be able to do with your computer? what is your computer manufacturer and model name (and how old)? what video card are you currently using? what is your psu wattage and maker?
i no 2 that i am thinking of getting that are agp the palit 6800gs super and the bfg 7600gs oc there both 512mb
here are some alternatives to the 7800gs. higher price = higher performance. here's a xfx 7600gs for $131:  and here's a bfg 6800gs for $176:  another alternative would be an ati x800xt all-in-wonder for about $185.  the 6800gs and x800xt will need a good 350w/400w power supply so add that to your budget if you're unsure about your current power supply.
