i'll explain my layout: i have dsl internet and 2 computers. one computer has 2 network cards, the other has one. i have the dsl modem going into one of the network cards on computer a. the 2nd card on computer a is hooked up to a 5 port switch. computer b is also hooked up to the switch. before i had broadband i used dialup. this set up worked fine for dial up, but for some reason the internet wont work at all if i try to network the 2 computers using this method. please help me! thanks
to the mix. for as little as $20, you get a device which will service the internet connection as well as provide the infrastructure for a local area network. ics works fine until some software incapatibility wrecks the networking ability of xp. a hardware solution is best.
add the router, get rid of one of the nics. connect the pcs to the router. done.
is the 5 port swith a router also? if is it then you won't have to buy a round and you would disregard the second nic card and connect the dsl directly to the switch and run ur network and share the internet thru that if now,then i would suggest buying a rounter to make things simple. you can also set the net on pc a then run the xp network wizard on pc a with internet sharing then run the network wizard on pc b telling it to get net access from pc a. *** do not foget on to distinguish the nic cards on pc a properly 1 would be for the net and the other for the network with internet sharing enabled. good luck
