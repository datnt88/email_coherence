hello, i have some computers in a workgroup and can't access my windows xp machine from the windows 2000 ones. if i try to browse the xp computer, it prompts for a user name and password but won't log me in even when i try to log in as administrator. i can, however, get to the windows 2000 computers from my xp one. have any of you ever ran into a problem similar to this? thanks, chris
your a stupid head everyone knows how to log on even my senile grandma can do it. (its windows its not rocket science!!!!!) _ su uno estpido cabeza cada uno saber cmo entrar uniforme mi senil grandma poder l. _ (su windows su no cohete ciencia!!!!!) _ apenas kidding!
i belive you have to run the windows xp network wizard on the xp machine to have it be accessible bye other computer on the network. i not a 100% sure if this will correct the issues with 2k machines accessing it
it can be that simple. bob
i ran the network setup wizard and it works great now. thanks!
