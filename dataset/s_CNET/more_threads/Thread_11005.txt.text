i'm thinking of creating a home network but the more i read the more confused i'm getting. first, we have four wireless phones operating at 2.4ghz. does this rule out creating a 802.11b or 802.11g based network due to interference? second, are there operating system constraints? i have a pc running on windows me, a laptop running windows 98 and another pc running windows 95. i'm not thrilled with the prospect of upgrading to xp (even though i hate me). can i find networking equipment compatible with win95? lastly, the amount of hardware i need is probably the thing i'm most confused with. my me machine is connect to the internet via cable modem. so, i need a router, yes? network interface cards in each computer? do i need an access point? is anyone familiar with powerline networks? what's needed with them? thanks.
with all those wireless phones around, not to mention any microwave ovens, it's likely interference would be an issue. my opinion would be to hardwire where you can(best solution), use a combo wifi/multiported switch/router(such as  ), then wap any dead spots with(something like this  ). operating systems are not likely an issue.
1. your wireless phones and a wireless network will not interfere with each other. 2. yes. you will need a router. wireless routers on the marketing allow for wired and wireless connectivity. 3. as much as i had to say it, i strongly suggest upgrading your win95 machine operating system, at least to win98 second edition. it will make your connectivity easier to manage. you may not have the hardware requirements on your win95 machine to do a full xp upgrade. 4. try this site (  ) and other sites (try typing
