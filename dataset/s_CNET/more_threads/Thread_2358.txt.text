i have a fairly new (about a year old) hp dvdwriter 300n. i would like to find out what works best in the drive as far as cd-rw s. maxcell is not one of them as well memorex. thnaks
i've used both maxell and memorex rw's and never had a problem. could be your burner, or software, or hardware(eg. insufficient power supply. give more details about your system.
you might try cleaning the laser head. and make sure you are using strong software i.e. nero, easy media creater. and hp's cdrws are not the best in the world either. jack
