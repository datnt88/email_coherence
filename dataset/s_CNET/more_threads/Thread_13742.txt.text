so this is kind of hard to explain... i live in an apartment complex that provides internet as part of the lease. we have a internet switch in a closet that sends internet to different rooms. when we connect via cord the internet works perfectly fine. but when we connect a router to the internet it works for a bit and then stops (wired and wireless). but when we unplug the router and plug in the computer it works no problem. we tried two routers and both do the same thing. both routers work just fine when used with other peoples (that do not live in my complex) internet. there is no problem with the computers connecting to the router. i can get to the set up and settings console via wireless no problem. so what i'm asking what could be causing this to happen? is there something that can cause a router to stop working yet the computer can overcome?
i could not figure out how to edit my post so here is some more info. my current router is a tp-link tl-wr841n. my roommate and i both have windows 7 computers.
it's noted in the forum sticky. but you can google it too. the words for google are: how to user a router as a wap. bob
thanks for pointing me in the right direction. well i hope. i don't know much about these things. hence why i came here. i don't know what a wap is so how can i find it in the stickies? i looked in the four for this forum and it was all gibberish to me. that's why i asked here.
no one expects folk to be a network guru overnight. unlike some places with a faq, here we only have the posts in these forums and some stuck to the top aka &quot;stickies.&quot; bob
