12938	7	332626	2991876	2991874	spomerantz	3/1/09 8:25 am	1.2358959e12	better manual address	i may not have given you the right version of the manual... this is the correct link... sorry...this is for my new firmware..

12938	9	332626	2991888	2991881	r. proffitt	3/1/09 9:04 am	1.23589824e12	wouldn't that cause your issue?	think it over very carefully. some get confused over the wan and lan settings. you claim above its an isp changing the ip address so no where should we be tinkering with the lan settings. also, you have to extend your thinking to &quot;how things work&quot; in regards to what a disconnect could do to help us fix this. i know many that will insist the documentation suggest that this could or should be used to some specific issue but you asked for ideas so here they are. bob
