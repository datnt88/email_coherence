after working with large video files - 60gb and 40gb, deleted but hd space did not free up. recycle bin is empty and files appear to be gone. ran chkdsk and defragged. using ntfs and win xp. tried steps outlined on microsoft site. how do i reclaim the space on my hd
did you try disk cleanup?? john
1. what video software you used. my old ulead left big files lying around. the new version has a cleanup menu. 2. if you use norton's protected recycle bin. it may need emptying. bob
i tried disc clean up using pinnacle studio 9 norton protected recycle bin is empty

since you're using pinnacle studio 9 did you also delete the auxiliary files? they take up a lot of space and are not needed if you are finished with your project.
