not sure i am in the rigth forum. i am looking for an inexpensive monitor for work. i definitely want a 5:4 aspect ratio, not a wide screen. i am looking at three hanns g comparable 19 inch models. the differences seem so minor that i can't make out what is significant. models are jc199apd, hh191dpb, and hx191dpb.
found your post and nothing else. is there a link to this available?
sorry that i did not provide more info. i am new at this. the page is in the cnet review site. i tried to add the link here, but o luck. i just copied it.
i'll tell why in a moment. the hannsg hh-191dpb contrast ratio pulls it ahead of the others. dhcp helps too. for me this model is a no sale since these are not the current technology of wide screen. because of my work i must get the new displays that you see today or my software efforts would be hampered by using the older displays. i'm sure you have a reason for this choice. bob
i am probably a little naive about this, but my reason for preferring a 5:4 aspect ratio to a wide screen is being able to see two documents at once one above the other, and see more of one document at a time. graphics capabilities is not my primary concern. i realize everything has moved to wide screen format. perharps there are some disadvantages that i don't understand. i welcome your thoughts on this.
i picked up the swivel model as you see at  if i didn't swivel that then maybe 2 docs side by side? all personal choice there. bob
