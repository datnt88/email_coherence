i recently bought a refurbished computer (hp m1270n) it seems to be louder then what i'm used to ( i had a compaq deskpro 233mhz. when the computer starts up and when i open programs the hard drive grinds. (its hard to describe) i'm not sure if this is common with this pc or not. is this something to be concerned about. is there any kind of checks that i can do? i do have warranty on the machine but i thought i would see what others thought. could this be a problem?
provided the warranty allows this, many don't, open the case and be sure the noise is from the hd. -or- simply request warranty now before time goes by. the noise could be from a fan, or a lousy mounting of the hd as it causes &quot;vibration&quot; upon the metal to metal contact. either way, warranty should cover it. no way should the hd be the source of noise of any kind, but lets not be too picky, if its more of a whine type noise and not real grinding, etc.. find the maker of the hd and goto thier support website and get thier diagnostic tools to determine or any hp may provide. tada -----willy
i agree with willy. my hp a1020n has a similar hd to yours and it is super quiet. all i hear is the normal hd sound when it is busy. i would contact hp support and get the ball rolling.
great. thanks for the advice.
hp support is pretty good. i was having software issues with a scanjet 4070 that i bought off the internet and hp tech support told me if they couldn't get it to work they would send me a new one and pay to ship the old one back to them even though i bought it refurbished elsewhere.
