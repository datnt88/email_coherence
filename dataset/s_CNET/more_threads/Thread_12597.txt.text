i have an older compaq computer 5320 ca from about 2002, i'm using windows xp. i used it for a couple of years then not for approximately 2 years. i have been using it for the last year without any problems. on saturday, it is now thursday, after about 5 hours my computer started to freeze to the point where it was no longer sending data and my mouse wouldn't work, it lasted a minute then was find for a while, then started to freeze more regularly once i turned it off i got a few more hours before it would start freezing again. each day the amount of time i would get before it froze has been getting shorter and shorter to the point today where it started almost immediately. now it is freezing about every minute or two for a minute or so. at some point in the last week my cd burner quit working (ie does not recognize when a cd is put into it). once it starts its freezing issues the cd burner has a red light on. the last few times i have tried to turn my computer off, it will not fully shut off competely. it does into shutdown mode but will not actually turn off. i thought originally it was a virus but i did a virus scan and it found nothing so then i did a factory reset and cleaned my computer. i thought maybe it was the fan not working, but i have a fan on it and that is not working, it has actually gotten worse. any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly welcomed
the symptoms sound like this needs doing.
i just did the fan cleaning today, i will let you know how it turns out and if my problem goes away.
this problem never goes away entirely. i was at one of the usual stores today and a few machines were frozen...
