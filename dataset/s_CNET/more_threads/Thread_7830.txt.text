my motherboard model is f690gvm id is 10/10/2007-rs690-sb600-6a669fk8c-00 what is the max processor i can put in this motherboard? acer is no help in the matter. thanks for any help
athelon x2 may be.
it currently has athelon x2 5000+. but it supports 8gb of memory so i somewhat have a hard time believing athelon is it. i'm thinking phenom x 4? maby i could contact a different part of acer. i emailed help with the question but the response seemed to be from a scripted & & typed by someone with little grasp of the english language completely ignoring my request for above question. possibly pay support if i can't get a definitive answer.
