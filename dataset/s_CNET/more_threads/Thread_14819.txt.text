hi, i have a 2wire 1000hg router in an office in my shop hooked up to a desktop system using a direct ethernet cable. i have another desktop hooked up using a 2wire wireless unit(about 30 feet away and works great). i have another desktop in a home office about 300 feet away(not working to great). i tried wrieless a couple years ago but it was just to far away. i had at&t wire the same phone line to my house as i was using for the dsl service. i then hooked this home office computer up using the 2wire pc port adapter and it worked so so. now it hardly ever works. what can i do to make this a wireless connection? or what can i do? when this is solved i need to network these three computers if its possible. thanks for any help.
maybe a couple antennas from  no one will tell you this will work and it should be unreliable some of the time. bob
bob, that site has nothng yet. i emailed whoever it was that has the site. hopefully they get back to me. thanks
btw, typing cantennas into google.com does find this product.
you might try using homeplug devices that send the network over the power wires. --- chas
i am not familiar with these units. do you have one type or manufacturer to recommend? i would like to read up on how they actually work and/or what they actually do. do they plug into a wall outlet by the router? or home computer that needs to be hooked up? i have 3 phase wiring under ground to my shop(router location) and very high power transmission lines next to my shop and house. do not know if this would help or hurt my situation.
