(and another question)	thank you so much for your help! i would like to ask you two more questions if that's alright. the first one being, can i put that stick of memory in my computer? the second, i also just received a box of old ram for another friend and he said that he thought if the a stick of ram had those two little notches in the bottom that they would work (the ram that's already in my pc has the two notches). is this true? thanks again for all the help! p.s. sorry for the delay in my replys, i have extremly slow dial-up.
