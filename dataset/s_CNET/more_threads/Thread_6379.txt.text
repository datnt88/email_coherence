hi all. i have a dell dimension 3000, p4, 3.2gh, 1gb ram, and would like to upgrade the cpu to a pentium d or other dual-core. i've never done a processor upgrade before... i need to know 1) is this possible or even sensible? 2) which cpu to buy & where (best prices)? 3) show me where i can find step-by-step instructions? thanks!
the problem with oem type systems is you're &quot;dead-end&quot; path to better options or upgrades or very limited. review your manual and find out if and what upgrades are available or visit the dell support website. i provide celeron d link as dell model 3000 also was sold as such. the intel info is here:   if that class of cpu(find yours) then see if adding a higher ghz rating is possible. the cpu itself will drop-in and should be seen automatically and be reset as so. however, that's not always a given with oem type systems and you may need to reset the bios to accept the new cpu. as for duo-mode cpu, nope. you have a different class of cpu, though don't take my word for it, recheck the specs. tada -----willy
you dell docs might akso help. vapcmd
the dimension 3000 uses the intel 865 chipset and can only support single core p4s. since you're already at 3.2ghz, upgrading to a 3.4 or 3.6ghz would be very expensive and result in only modest improvements.
is there a web site you would recommend to help navigate through the process of understanding what upgrades are possible given a current motherboard? i am in a similar situation to the earlier writers in this thread, want to upgrade a p4 3.0 ghz with ht, 925x mobo in a dell dimension 8400 and don't quite know where to start.
thanks everyone... i'll wait for the dual core---next pc i buy...
you could refer to intel's chipset website (  ) which shows which cpus are compatible with the chipset. but that doesn't mean that your motherboard's bios has enabled support for all potential cpus. you may get the info from you system vendor's website, but generally they only tell you what it came with, not what can be put in it. anyway, your 925x mobo is limited to single core cpus only. (the 945, 946, 965, and 975 chipsets are required for dual-core pentium-d; 945 and 975 chipsets may support core2duo depending on the motherboard; 946 and 965 definitely support core2duo.) your motherboard is made by intel. there's a good chance it will support a p4-3.4ghz. i don't know if $100 is worth it for a 13% cpu boost:  you could replace your motherboard and cpu to get to core2duo. your hard drive, cd/dvd, ram, and video card can be reused. intel dg965ss, $120:  core2duo e6300, $190:  vista home premium, $125:
appreciate the references. i don't think a chip upgrade will get me much, but i'm planning to move from 512mb to 2.5gb on system memory. think i'll get more out of that than anything else...
