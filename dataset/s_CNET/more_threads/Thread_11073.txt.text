has anybody bought this thing i cant seem to find any reveiws on it on the net. its a westinghouse 17&quot; widescreen flat-panel tft-lcd monitor .thanx a lot
best buy has to offer something is certain price ranges otherwise, people(buyers) won't come-in. westinghouse is a good brand name, but it never was a recent electronics power house. its just another import offered branded by westinghouse, so take care and read the specs. if possible, take one in hand and look at the model label/sticker you may find who really makes it and thus take that to the google search. sorry, for now, price is the best virtue of the lcd. everyone wants a cheap lcd, but if you really intend to keep it for awhile, cheap is not the way to go and pay for decent brandname out there. if not best buy, some vendor always has a sale on some lcd. tada -----willy
try newegg.com, frys, geeks.com and such and you'll find those as well. for the price, not bad. bob
thanx for the help guys but i think widescreen would give mor picture for a widescreen type dvd movie. isnt that so , correct me if i am wrong
all i can say is i couldn't have bought a better one for the price, i play a lot online, especially bf2 and this lcd is hands down one of the best i've used, if you have the dvi-d cable, it looks awesome, i recommend it 150%, sorry if you got the answer already
it's an outstanding monitor. i have 2 of them. you will be very happy. use the 1280x768 setting. if you are making the jump from crt 800x600 it will take a little getting used to, but well worth it. in 30 days someone will need a gun to take it away from you. nice looking white monitor with a sharp, bright, colorful picture! if you've never run a widescreen, you're in for a real treat.
