hi, i'm a student, and i am in need of a new comp for christmas. i am considering a fast computer (core 2 duo) that can run many apps. i was looking at the 20 inch imac and the slim xps desktop for dell. i am not sure what desktop to get. do you guys have any suggestions of a desktop that is perfect for fast performance? i also want to play a little games. i don't want to waste my money and crappy computer so what is a good one? core 2 duo at least 1 gb ram 250 above gb hard drive good graphics card thanks
answered your own question with the specs you have listed. some other suggestions, the ram should be ddr2 and an 256mb video card. a pci-e slot be available for future video upgrades. as for the manf. i can't help on that one as i have been building my own for years. i would go with a pc for gaming.
it's a whole lot easier to have it upfront than to try to add/upgrade later. vapcmd
