i'm advising someone on how to build a nice gaming pc for under $1000, and we seem to have found a pretty nice match. i was just wondering if everything will be compatible and work fine. here's the list: case: enermax blue aluminum atx mid tower case with 400w psu, model &quot;10mcs-56881lbfs-d3&quot; -retail motherboard: intel &quot;boxd915pcyl&quot; 915p chipset motherboard for intel lga 775 cpu -retail processor: intel lga 775 pentium 4 520 2.8 ghz, 800mhz fsb, 1mb l2 cache, hyper threading technology - retail memory: crucial 240-pin dimm 512 ddr2 from crucial.com video card: ati radeon 9800 pro video card, 256mb ddr, 256-bit, dvi/tv-out, 8x agp -retail floppy drive: nec 1.44mb black internal floppy drive, oem cd-rom drive: samsung black 52x32x52 cd-rw drive, model sw-252senb, oem bulk hard drive: western digital 120gb 7200rpm sata hard drive, model wd1200jd, oem drive only thank you.
also, he doesn't need a monitor, keyboard, or mouse.
btw, i noticed the radeon 9800 pro video card wouldn't work, since the motherboard doesn't have an agp slot. i've changed it to: ati radeon x700 pro video card, 256mb ddr, 128-bit, dvi/tv-out, pci-express, model &quot;100-437402&quot; -retail
especially for gaming, an athlon 64 3000+ would be a much better choice than a p4 520. in doom 3 for example, an athlon 64 3000+( $133 for the socket 754, or $150 for the socket 939 ) beats a $780 pentium 4 3.2 ghz ee.  it is also a great performer for other games and general use.  the socket 754 athlon 64 3000+ is cheaper than the 939 version, and the 754 motherboard is also cheaper, but the 939 motherboard will give more room for future upgrades, and a 90nm socket 939 will probably use less power and run cooler than a 130 nm socket 754 one. it doesn't make sense to even consider a 2.8 ghz (520) pentium 4 at $162, when for less you can get an athlon 64 3000+ which beats a pentium 4 3 ghz (or even a much faster p4) in most games.
everything will work together in that list, except the video card, its a good video card, but that motherboard doesn't have an agp slot. you'll need to find a video card that's pci 16x
good luck finding a pci e grfx card for cheap... your better off changing mobos arent you?
