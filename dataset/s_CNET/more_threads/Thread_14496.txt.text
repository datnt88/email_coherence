i'm recently subscribed to verizon dsl, and am attempting to network my 2 computers (a desktop and a laptop. i ran the home networking wizard in windows on both computers, and correctly installed the westell versalink router i received from verizon, but when i try to send something from my laptop to my printer (connected to desktop), i get a printer not responding error message. i am running windows me on the desktop, and xp on the laptop if that matters. help!!!!
to the xp machine as a network printer, does it appear in the printer folder?
yes, if i connect the printer directly to my laptop it works just fine.
&quot;yes, if i connect the printer directly to my laptop it works just fine.&quot; in order for the laptop to access a shared printer connected to another pc on the lan, the printer must be: 1) shared from the host pc 2) added to the printers folder on the remote pc as a networked printer with the path indicated as a network path, not lpt1.
i'm not real computer literate so i didn't understand what you meant but i'll try this and see if it works thank you
