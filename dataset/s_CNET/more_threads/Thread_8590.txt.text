bob as in r. proffitt. i read in another post that you said there were issuses with me and external dvd r/w drives but it could be done. what are they and how can you work around them? i was thinking about doing just that and now i wonder if i should.
the issues are. 1. 4 gigabyte filesize limit in fat32. no fix (ever) for this one. why its a limitation is that you won't be able to make an .iso image to make a dvd. let me clarify that this will not stop you from creating dvds, but a few tricks and methods will not be available to you. 2. resources (64 thousand bytes) video editing is cpu intensive, but some software packages have thrown in the towel on dos based windows and don't run at all on 95/98/me. again, no fix ever for the 64 thousand pools of memory called resources for windows 95/98/me. again, this only limits what you can do. not a stop. best of luck, bob
ok bob as you can tell i don't know much. what is a &quot;iso image&quot;? what i want to do is use this as a way to make backups on my two computers. one runnung xp and the other me. can i do that with out a lot of trouble.
the iso image is best researched at google, but in one sentance, it's a file that contains all of a cd/dvd image ready for your cd/dvd recording software to use. since today's dvd can be 4.7gb, you can see that you won't be able to create that. as to backup of files, you should be fine. bob
