[img]  [/img] not a huge gamer or anything so i let my friend pick it for me. i mainly use my pc to make videos so i was wondering if this pc build was good.
graphics card. for about the same price as the evga gt 250, you can pick up a sapphire radeon hd5770 card. the graphics will be much better  (and your motherboard supports both ati and nvidia)
the specs is definitely good enough for video making/editing. i second the change of graphic card to hd5770.
