i just bought a usb flash drive. no instructions came with it and when i went to the website simpletech.com it didn't help much either. after it was instaled there was an icon i clicked on that had something about zip and unzip on it. is this for transfering files to the flash drive?
operating system? model name of flash drive?
windows me simpletech
and only works with win. 2000 and xp.
