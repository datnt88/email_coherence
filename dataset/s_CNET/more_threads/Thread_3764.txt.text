alright...i have recentely built a computer and am having early trouble. i have a p4 3.0e, 1024 of ram, 6600gt vcard, asus p4800se, a harddrive from a dell( ata iv seagate barracuda), and a cd/rw drive from the dell, and a floppy from the dell. my computer recognizes the p4, ram, vcard...but i keep getting an error message &quot;primary slave drive - atapi incompatible&quot; my harddrive was quick formated, and i have not installed windows, due to the fact that i can not. any help would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance
slave position of the primary ide port?? try unplugging that. any chance that you have the drives improperly jumpered?? or using cable select and have them plugged into the incorrect connectors??
the master [boot drive] as the problem, can't you simply proceed???
using one ide port or two...or simply just how is your ide ports being used with the devices attached? congrats '05 -----willy
