hi everyone in this town there is neither cable tv provider nor cable isp what do inetrnet cafes use to connect to the net ? (i guess dsl, isdn ? ) there are about 30 pcs in the nearest internet caf can i get faster download from there ? thank you for your precious time and advice .(pstn ,win98 ) hpc
regardless of dsl or cable, a &quot;smart&quot; internet cafe would install a monster proxy server so that content could be cached locally. i'd set up such so the first person that gets something takes the delay. others just read from the local server. bob
dear mr. r. proffitt thank you for your precious time and advice. thank you. hpc
