i have windows xp on my keyboard. does anyone know the name of a computer keyboard (and how to get one) that has a very soft touch, similar to the touch of the old ibm selectronic typewriter? thank you very much. al brown
i have the same request for my laptop. i was unable to test at the time of purchase and would find a softer touch easier to work with. is there a way to adjust?
my solution -&gt;  this keeps the laptop keyboard clean and new over the years and i can choose from many on the market. how to choose? go shopping. bob
