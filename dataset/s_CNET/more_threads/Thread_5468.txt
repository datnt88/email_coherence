(no &quot;value&quot; facet) from my dell 266 mhz. windows of course automatically installed some generic creative sound drivers, and then system sound workedbeeps, alerts, and even all games i tested. but the audio of my dvd player software (cinemaster software that came with my 2000 shipped-with hardware decoder, now made by ravisant/cifelli) did not work. i even tried downloading drivers from  but to no avail for my dvd. did i really fry my original live! value card by using that cable? what should i do regarding the dvd software? (i am first off going to try to reinstall the software itself and also the drivers for the decoder card.) thanks for all your help. it's greatly appreciated. henry
