tried everything cannot open computer to insert new disk
reread your post. what is missing? did you read the red note below where you posted this question? since there are a gazillion compaq towers, what do you think we may need?
you offered no details. wag here, but goto the compaq support website and locate your model#. there find the details for hd replacement( i assume new hd), that's the same info as adding 2nd or swapping out old hd. in most cases, if no screws are present o open case, locate a &quot;latch&quot;, depress and slide side cover back or up to remove. if you have a model that's a &quot;clam type&quot; you need to open as if like a book, spread the case open. i hope this helps. once again, it always helps if you provide details of your pc as much as possible. tada -----willy
