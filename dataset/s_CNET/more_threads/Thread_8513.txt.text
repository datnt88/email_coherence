i was trying to fix my scanner when i noticed the scsi/raid host controller was conflicting with the direct memory access controller. here is what the conflicting device list says: input/output range 0000 - 0002 used by: direct memory access controller i tried removing the scsi controller and restarting windows in hopes that it would choose a different io range but it went back to the way it was. i would appreciate any help. win2k msi ms-6330 via kt133/a chipset
did the scanner ever work? did you try the scsi controller in a different slot?
1. the bios is out of date. 2. the person who installed the os didn't install the motherboard driver package or check for latest version of that package. it's a repeating problem since many expected microsoft to install such. bob
the scanner actually connects through the lpt port, and that is built into the motherboard. the scanner did work before, but i haven't used it in months (updated lots of drivers since) and i don't know if this conflict is the culprit.
