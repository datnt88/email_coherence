i have a floppy disk with a very important document on it that i need to get off of it. however when i put the disk into the floppy drive of a couple different computers it prompts me to format the disk. i read about this problem once before but i don't recall how to get around it. the only copy of this document is on the floppy. please advise. po
i boot my old dos based machine and copy the file out. it's a known issue with windows and some bits on the diskette. i decline to look it up, explain it or more but share my way. bob
got it. any advice for a fool like myself with no dos machine? po
it's over at bootdisk.com you must know someone that has such or such skill. but be sure to write protect the floppy until you save it. best of luck, bob
