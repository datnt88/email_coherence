i have a six year old powerbook, os 10.4. does it have a 2.0 usb port? after downloading itunes 7.1.1 it is telling me that i don't. i checked the speed in system preferences and it says 1.2 mb/sec. thanx
a friend noted this adapter  allowed them to use the firewire port. bob
no, you only have usb 1.0 on that machine. check out bob's answer if this is for the ipod p
