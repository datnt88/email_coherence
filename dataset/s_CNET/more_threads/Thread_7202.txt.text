i have two ide devices that i need to hook up to a new motherboard that has only sata connectors [6], im new to this type of mobo and will get sata devices eventually, but are there adaptors. the devices are a hard drive and a disk player. thanks
they are out there. sata to ide adapters personally, if it was necessary, i'd get an add in card rather than something that plugs into the mb ports. you might also consider that you won't be achieving the performance improvements that sata offers. you're putting money into old technology but that's your choice.

there are others out there with more bells and whistles. do a google for ide controller card. i use one. when i plugged it in and powered up, xp found it and installed the drivers. no hassel.
