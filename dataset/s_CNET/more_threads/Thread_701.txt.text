so, i am ready to pick up a semi-decent gaming pc. i'm afraid my tech skills have diminished quite a bit over the last few years. never had the time to keep up with the exploding tech. deciding between two. amd phenom ii x6 1055t 2.8ghz processor 64 bit six-core 8gb amd radeon hd 6670 1gb intel core i5-2320 3.0ghz processor 64 bit quad-core 8gb amd radeon hd 6770 1gb i'm leaning toward the second one, i believe i can actually upgrade ram on this one, but i'm confused on the &quot;core&quot; amount. four vs. six? meaningful? necessary? any help or thoughts would be great. thanks in advance!!
i think your leaning in the proper direction. will there be a dramatic difference between the two?........doubtful.
well, do you want 4 cores? or 6... six is better of course =d
we are mostly developers and not to upset the amd folk, the i5 you listed is very very nice. go look at tomshardware cpu charts to see. bob
