it will allow you to use the 6gb of ram.
hi, do i have an option of windows xp 64bit cause iam not really happy with vista. i like the vista interface and everything, but the background software that runs in vista is very annoying. i also want to know weather the ram iam going to buy now will match and work along with my old ram. cause i heard about some latency and other stuff should also match.
and xp 64bit it officially end of life from microsoft's viewpoint. they didn't even release a 64bit version of xp sp3.
