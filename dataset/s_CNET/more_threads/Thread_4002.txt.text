i am using a router with wpa2-psk. i want to connect manually to the network with my xp netbook; i.e. i don't want windows to store the key, i want to type it in each time i connect. it is probably a simple thing, but i can't figure it out in xp (in vista i just uncheck a box...). i am using windows xp home. thanks!
the pc software or xp?
right now win xp is managing the connection, but i'm open to alternatives if it's easier and if the software is free.
(i know it's rude to &quot;bump&quot; a thread, but maybe it got forgotten over the christmas weekend...?!) thanks.
but you could create a script to delete it. i won't bore you with why windows is coded to remember it and why it would cause users to erupt into flame as the connection dropped and they would have to re-enter the password. but think about these tools to research where it is stored to write a script. (you do this!)  so there is it. regmon, filemon or just use the new thing. sorry but you ask a good question but it flies in the face of ease of use so you get to craft your own solution. bob
in vista i just uncheck a box after entering my key...you know, vista is very much under-rated compared to xp! thanks for those links...i'll look into them.
i have windows 7 so i'll have to look to see if that has it. sorry but we're down to our last vista here. the kids are glad to know it's soon to be history. we bought that family pack windows 7 upgrade for the home.
