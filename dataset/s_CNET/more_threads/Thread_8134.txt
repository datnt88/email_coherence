14463	0	108491	1235772	nr	william wagner	6/10/05 11:43 am	1.11840378e12	wireless signal drops	i have bought a di-524 wireless router. i followed all the instructions to configure the router's hardware and software and after several calls to d-link, i achieved success. i have my notebook connected to lan port 1 on the router and an old windows 98 computer has a d-link wireless pci card in it. it all worked. both computers could access the internet and i set up a small home network successfully. when i turned my notebook on the next morning, my entire d-link folder and contents had disappeared -- evaporated. it was as though windows xp had decided it could do a better job of running a wireless newtwork than d-link configuration could. much to my surprise, the wireless network still works -- sort of. every 10 to 60 seconds, a balloon pops up in the system tray of my notebook telling me a network cable is unplugged, but it isn't. the system instantly reconnects itself and i can carry on surfing the internet. my internet phone which i use for long distance calls and my live365 radio, both of which i have used for years without problems, disconnect each time the balloon comes up -- but these two applications will not automatically reconnect as the internet will. so, i can not use my pcphone or listen to internet radio anymore. the strangest of all is that yesterday, i had a whole day of no balloons or dropped signals. everything worked perfectly. i listened to the radio and made several voip calls. the days before i had problems. today i have problems. yesterday, i had no problems. i have added no software or hardware. i have made no changes. can anyone offer advice? i'm at my wit's end.
