13454	1	333334	2995262	2995255	r. proffitt	3/5/09 5:05 am	1.2362295e12	be sure to google that.	but let me comment on &quot;router.&quot; this one has changed in definition over the years. my first router back in 1990 did exactly what the name implied. today, 2009 the &quot;router&quot; is that consumer piece of gear that comes with wifi, router with nat, switched hub and more. without nailing down the year you want to define this in and a context the exact definition can be fluid. bob
13454	2	333334	2995264	2995262	dougwylie	3/5/09 5:26 am	1.23623076e12	i sure googled it	thanks for your reply bob. it was actually the fact that the definition of router *is* so dynamic, that caused me to post in a forum rather than google. there's various different conflicting factual sets of &quot;definitions&quot; out there so i wanted an expert opinion not a set of conflicting facts (as you get bogged down with if you use google to compile a glossary - which i'm doing). the year i want to define this in is 2009, and the context is that i'm putting together a generic glossary (hoping to encompass definitions in the consumer, enterprise, industry, etc contexts). does anyone know of any good networking glossary sites...? doug.
