(could just be the cable) anyway, here is the new problem. i was able to get inot grub to choose if i wanted to boot into windows and linux. but when i choose one, the computer restarts. so i figgured that i would just start by wiping the drives, and throwing windows back on there. i can boot off my instal cd, and i get into the set up screen, but the windows set up is telling me that it cant locate a hard drive. when i check the bios, it tells me that my hard drives are there. even the fact that i can get to grub (and even to the part where windows asks if i want to boot in safe mode, the last known good config, or normal) tells me that the hard drives are there. what should i do?
