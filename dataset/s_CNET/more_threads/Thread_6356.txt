10	14	40992	541053	541011	r. proffitt	11/14/04 8:42 am	1.10042172e12	warranty.	you need to pressure the supplier to stand up to the system parts. of course you'll remove the case cover, have a current bios, bios defaults and not think that a new board would have the latest bios. no spyware either. bob
