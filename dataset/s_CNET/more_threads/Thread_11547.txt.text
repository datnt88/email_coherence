i have on my comp: windows xp sp2 *32 bit zebronic motherboard nf-7050 intel core2 duo e4500 sony dvd rw aw-g170a above dvd writer mentioned does not read some dvd's on my computer. it just shows &quot;0 bytes&quot; as the total size of dvd and also as the free space on dvd. these same dvd's are read on my other computer. why does it show dvd's loaded with movies,data as blank dvd?? please help.
i decline to do heavy research on this (you do that) but sony does employ a sort of copy protection in their products. i would not expect the usual copy protected dvd to cooperate with explorer as it's not a data dvd. bob
sony dvd rw aw-g170a show free sapce 0 byte and total space 0 byte it does not read few dvd but it run on other dvd
many forget how such works. that is, software support and fling dvd rw from machine to machine forgetting something important.
can u just tell me the solution to tht dvd ..even im facing the same problem
the problem as you presented it has not changed. copy protected content is just that. did you expect me to help you copy that? bob
