preferably if you own the one-touch mini-  tried contacting seagate, but of course, they're closed on weekends & their hours'll be spotty for the holidays. few things: i'm a little lost on how to use to &quot;sync&quot; & back-up features. what're the main differences between them? also, i'm getting the red 'm' icon on my toolbar. (the maxtor isn't &quot;found&quot; on the laptop) there's no way easy to find a help area for this thing & i'm a novice to it all. damn. all i really wanna do is store stuff (esp. music) from my laptop to the maxtor. thanks in advance
i'm trying to do the sync feature (turned off the automatic setting) & it won't do it. stays at 0% forever. when i 1st got it a bit over a year ago, it was fine. managed to transfer lots of stuff to it. (though admittedly, i don't do it often) should i uninstall/reinstall or might that screw things up?
i don't use their software since there is zero support. i installed syncback and acronis and am happy with the results. one of this is free and both are found on the internet. bob
got your reply on the &quot;pc hardware&quot; forum. was hoping for a 2nd opinion...
