hi.. i'm hoping i can get help with this.. i will be moving to dubai in about 1 mth and i have a mac g5 and two macbook pros.. my question is does anybody know wherei can purchase power adapters suited to the voltage system in dubai? since dubai uses 220v and here in the us we use 120v. thanks much nnekalb
all of the current mac's can use either voltage with not adapter necessary. power supplies in the g5 are auto-switching as are the ac adapters for the laptops. p
cool thank you!!
