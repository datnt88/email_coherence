hey all i need some help. at work we are trying to put 2 computers in the same room, the room has only one port, and since we are renting our space from a larger company they don't want us putting a router or anything else up that would hide a pc behind its own ip. so i was thinking of maybe a switch or hub? are they the same? and do they create there own ip? thanks lee
you need another ethernet card on one box. set it up as a sever for lan and the second box as a client.
if it's like most places, that's all you need.
