are you running a firewall? have you set the trusted zone to allow sharing? good luck, click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about internet connections, and download free software. if you're reading this, thank a teacher. if you're reading this in english, thank a u.s. soldier.
when you right click on a folder, and go to shareing and security, make sure you check both share this folder and allow others to change folders check boxes.if you don't you get a oneway share.
