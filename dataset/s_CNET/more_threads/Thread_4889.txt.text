after several problems with this specific desktop, that was already attempted to be solved by members here i have a new problem. finally when i think that i have the solution i can't even get that far. the desktop currently refuses to boot up, and not no power all together but when the computer starts boot up the power led turns orange and the fans rev up to high speed like they should. however it stays like this, then after a minute or so will shut down if not shut down manually. but then it will cut back on to the same state by itself after a few seconds until manually shut off twice then it stays off. i am completely baffled by this and any help would be great. thank you in advance.
what can you remove to make the machine simpler? what part didn't you replace? are you trying to save some old hard drive or board? bob
i haven't modified the contents of this computer hardware wise and i am not trying to save any old parts so i will swap out the two ram chis and try therm individually separately and let you know how that goes
if you research the dead pc on google the advice repeats. remove everything till it beeps in protest. remember i don't know the story of this machine. could be as simple as a dead cmos battery but a tech with a volt meter would check that. do you have a volt meter? bob
