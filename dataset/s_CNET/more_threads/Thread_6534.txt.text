i'm looking for a good reliable all-in-one to print, copy, and fax. all the user reviews of hps products have made me want to avoid them like the plague, but there's not many other choices. canon looks like a good, yet not perfect fit. i need a good printer/copier that does well with drawings and text. printing photos isn't the most important issue, though it would be nice. i also need a fax that has an auto document feeder that works, which seems like the weakness of most that i've looked at. am i better off getting a print/copier combo and a dedicated fax, or there any machines that do it all well?
i do not like the concept, and therefore i haven't paid much attention to them. this one got good reviews on the forum earlier.
it has all the features your looking for except i don't know what kind of drawings you will be printing out but they should look good. just make sure you use diffusion or the high quality print setting for drawings. also run a automatic printhead alignment. the text is near laser quality and graphics are very good and it also has a adf. the adf seems to work the best out of all the ones i have had. the photo quality is excellent. officemax and newegg.com both sell them for around $200.
