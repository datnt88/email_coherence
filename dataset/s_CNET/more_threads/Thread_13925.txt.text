before my trusty roommate was shipped off to iraq, i bought his router so now i have two exactly same routers, the linksys wrt320n. both units are still using oem firmware. i have been searching online to find out how i can use both in my network. i would like to use one for g network at 2.4mhz and another for n at 5mhz. the information i found online is very technical and for a noob like myself, little hard to follow. can anyone here give some pointers on how to set up my network? i have been researching online for the past week or so and i am still confused...
the top posts about post 18 and 19 note how to do this. this will not help those that can't configure the wifi portion of the router but it shows how to get both connected and working. bob
thanks bob! is this the link you are referring to in your post?  if so then how many routers can i daisy chain in this manner? can i add a third router as a access point? so, linksys #1 n @ 5mhz linksys #2 n @ 2.4mhz airlink #3 g @ 2.4mhz would this set up be possible without too much interference? or should i just drop the airlink and focus on the two linksys? thank you once again bob..looking forward to your reply..
if our netmask is 255.255.255.0 we have some 254 devices we can assign addresses to. we are at 253 possible more waps but then that would have no clients so my answer is 251 waps with one client. bob
