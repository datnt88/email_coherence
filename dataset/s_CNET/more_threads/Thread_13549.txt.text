hi, i have a win xp sp2 with 2 ethernet cards (1 with motherboard and 1 seperately installed). i have 2 internet connections 256 kbps each connection hooked to the computer via ethernet cards (no router is used). both connections are from 2 different isp - 1 having dynamic ip while the other having a static ip. i would like to combine both the connections into 1 (512 kbps conenction -- not balance them) and the output connection should be using the static ip. how can i go about doing this? system config: amd 3000+ with 512 mb ram two 100/10 ethernet cards (1 inbuilt in motherboad while other is seperately installed) win xp sp2. any help provided would be appreciated. thank you
just to add, each of these connections have their respective logins without which they will not work. thanks
windows has no concept of ecmp (equal cost multi path) routing. using 2 different isps is also a bad choice. this typically requires using bgp and obtaining an autonomous system number. you would be better off dumping one isp and upgrading the other. skrall
that is sad. now if that is not possible, can i do load balancing so that i constantly get 256kbps connection or i cant even do that? regards, hiren mehta
i came across this post right now because i am trying to do some load balancing too. until now i have found that you can do a load balancing with a built-in load balance router. to my opinion microtic os router would be a good choice
