i've been using a linksys wireless g broadband router, which works good depending on my location in the house, as good as one would expect. i also have connected devices (pvr's) at different points in my house that are connected via the 4 ports of the router. i recently came upon a spare wireless b access point, linksys as well, that i was planning to connect to the network through one of the cat 5s that was being used by a pvr. is this possible ? i did try connecting it, and the signal is excellent in that area, but i do not have internet access with that connection. (it's listed as a seperate possible connection point) might it be because the 1st wireless device has wep? any help would be appreciated. thanks in advance. greg hribal gregpd@aol.com
and configure it with the same ip range.. and use it as repeater/range expander.. place it in between your main ap and your pc location. but, as you said it is a b type.. so you will get the b speed (11mbps).
look at this post..
