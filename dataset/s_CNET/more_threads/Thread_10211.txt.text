i'm about to buy a tablet and need some help deciding between these wide aspect choices:  (2000 dpi., affordable) not sure if it will work well with sketchbook pro... anyone know?  (only 1000dpi., this one is affordable also)  (a little more than i want to spend. 2000lpi.) wacom is too expensive for the size i want. looking to spend about $100(+,-). i'm mostly unsure about how all of these will work with sketchbook. i think i like the adesso but i'm just not sure yet. anyone have any other suggestions/advice? thanks for any help.
i would also go with the adesso.
i can't find a single adesso z12 product review. it looks like a good one but i really wish i could read some reviews... i did come across this tablet though:  this one is a little cheaper and appears to have a lot of the same features as the adesso. what do you guys think? thanks again.
