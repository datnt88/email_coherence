have ecs k7s5a board, dimm, dvd, cd burner. first pc would start intermitently, then it stopped turning on. i only have power to hd and floppy. pc appeared to post,saw monitor scroll for a few seconds then go blank. hd ran for a few minutes then system shutdown and will not start. i have connected monitor to another pc and it is ok. using antec power supply tester ps seems to be ok; ps is 250w which may be low but system has been running for a couple years without a problem. what else should i check?
in the towel, or your cpu is getting too hot very fast, like with a dead hsf fan. the power supply may also be shutting down due to too much starting current. possibly disconnecting the power and signals from some devices may let the supply start. then put them back, one at a time, to see if it is the supply or a bad device.
testing with new ps. win2k (not xp, sorry) keeps re-booting, did a boot normally and system is now hanging at logon.
