i got a geforce fx 5700 ultra graphics card and was thinking of upgrading. whats a good agp graphics card to get? also my power supply says output 400w max on it.
but assuming you want to stay under $150: $105, sapphire radeon x1650,  $120 ($20 rebate), evga 7600gs,
k thanks, i think ill get the 7600
