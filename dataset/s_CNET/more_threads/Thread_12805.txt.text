i am looking to upgrade my graphics card and was wondering if anyone could tell me about this particular one (i.e. if it's worth the buy); crucial radeon x1600 pro 512mb agp. also, any suggestions on a card would be appreciated. thanks.
i'd read the user reviews. bob
do you have any recommendations on graphics cards? thanks.
my current card was not hacking it. the user reviews are quite revealing about power, heat and dell. bob
