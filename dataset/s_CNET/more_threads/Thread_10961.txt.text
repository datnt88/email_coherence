will i damage my computer if i replace my current 250w power supply with a 300w or higher model? thanks!
amount of current that they need. the voltages out of the supply to the devices is precisely regulated for voltage [5, 12, 3.3] thus the devices have no idea how much power the supply could provide. based on a standard supply, not a proprietary system such as the old dells which used different wiring in the same connector.
make sure it is the correct replacement type. you didn't mention anything of your system. but, installing a higher wattage unit is ok provided the connections are the same type, etc.. here is ahelpful site that may explain further:  good luck -----willy
