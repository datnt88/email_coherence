2109	5	93118	1053046	1053019	r. proffitt	3/18/05 8:17 am	1.11113382e12	since i have the dlink, i can share one fault.	it's a little slow on the menus. in fact, i'd say it needs to get about 1/2 the time to display stuff for me to never note it as a nuisance. the other gotcha is that dlink doesn't reveal how to encode video for playback. i've had to use the old trial and error method and still haven't nailed it. i'd try another media center like that when i can this year, but for now its working. bob
2109	6	93118	1053179	1053019	mackman	3/18/05 9:00 am	1.1111364e12	reading reviews	one thing i would consider is what do i want to do with this system in the future. in reading reviews and doing comparisions look at the expandability of the case and memory in relation to what you may want to do and is this power supply really adequate?
2109	7	93118	1053285	1053179	r. proffitt	3/18/05 9:36 am	1.11113856e12	for mackman about the dlink media center.	there is no expansion available for ram and the power supply seems just fine. just wondering if you were talking about some other device and if so, be sure to respond to the post about it or note it in your posting. bob
2109	8	93118	1053382	1053285	3luke3	3/18/05 10:04 am	1.11114024e12	oops...	i meant that i was interested in the hp media center 2005. i definitely want a comp, even though the other device is nice & cheap. i wouldn't mind paying twice as much though, but the question is... what kind of increase in performance & capability will i be able to acheive for an extra $800 ?
