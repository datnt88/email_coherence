i would like to have my desktop pc interact with my netbook. they are both connected (wired) to a linksys 2.4 router. what and how is the best way to connect them?
when i go to establish a home network it asks if i want to share the printer and folders. i want to share folders but only from one computer to the other not to the internet. i just want two computer to talk to each other.
from each machine you control the level of access. since only you know the operating system of each machine, you'll have to dig a little.
thank you for your response. i tried to set up both computers but nothing happened. i do not have much patience, when it is something that does not matter one way or the other, so i gave up. just have too much time on my hands.
if you don't have the patience why not have this done for you? call up some local talent and tell them what you want done. then have them tell you when it's working so you don't have to wait or invest personal time in the effort. bob
thank you for your suggestion. i continued to play around with this set up and discovered that on the desktop i can access the netbook by accessing the &quot;workgroup&quot;. on the netbook i can access the desktop with &quot;network places&quot;. i do not know if that is the best or correct way but i have been able to transfer data and that is what i wanted to do. when i delete a folder in the &quot;share document&quot; folder it does not delete the original, does it?
make a backup copy to another folder and then delete one. the shared document when deleted does delete the original here. bob
thank you for the suggestions. i found out the hard way about deleting but was able to recover it. i think i am getting the hang of this.
