this is a silly question but i am all confused so i am posting this for help... i have a dvd of an event i did a few weeks ago and i wanted to reproduce them to send to my sponsors. how do i do that using my mac computer (intel based)? i'll appreciate an immediate feedback. thanks!
the usual way to copy a dvd is to use roxio toast and choose copy. you should also be able to use the disk utility to make an image of the original dvd, provided that it is not a commercial encrypted dvd. once you have made the image, you can reproduce as many copies as you want using the finder as the burning software. if you need further help, just holler. pp
i'll appreciate if you can e-mail me a step by step using the disc utility you are talking about... sorry to be a pain. look forward to hearing from you again. thanks!
in your user profile and i will be happy to do that p
and allowed you to contact me via e-mail. look forward to receiving your instructions. thanks a lot!
