i have a &quot;toshiba satellite pro 430cdt&quot; that i'm trying to get open so i can replace the hard drive. i have taken the obvious screws out, but still can't figure out the &quot;riddle&quot; of getting into the thing. thanks for your help. jerry
first link describes the procedure. cheers, bob ps. i did this a few times this month and i used ghost and a laptop hard drive adaptor to save a lot of reinstall time.
thanks bob, for getting my &quot;fat&quot; out of the fire. jerry
