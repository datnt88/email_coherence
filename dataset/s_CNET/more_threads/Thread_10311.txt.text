i have an airtel broadband connection in my 2 storey house . . but it is at ground floor ( i can run only 1 pc at a time ) . . so i wanted to intall a wireless connection over now( cos of laptop ) but i wanted it to be spread throughout the house . . intalling one router will cause problems due to concrete walls . . therefore i was considering if their was any way i could install a router on each floor so that their is no problem in future . . now i wanted to know whether it is possible through one connection .. ?? if yes then how . . if you have a better way plzz kindly let me know
while i didn't have any issue with our 2 storey, let's go with the story you could not get wifi to the second floor. how i solve that is with 2 more things. 1. an ac powerline bridge (see amazon and google) 2. a second router but configured as a wap. (see google for how to do that.) this is just above beginner networking so you must be comfortable with this and researching it on google or have it done for you. bob
which router did you use for your 2 storey home
all have been netgear, dlink and linksys. why did i change? mostly as time passed i wanted to get 802.11n then the next one had opendns support and so on. all worked fine. bob
