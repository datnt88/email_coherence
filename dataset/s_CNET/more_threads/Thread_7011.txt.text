i am totally lost here. i need a webcam to take online school courses that won't time out on me yet doesn't cost an arm and a leg. i can't afford a camcorder and i need good resolution with face tracking. i live on a fixed income and would truly appreciate any help what so ever on a new or used but working unit. tim eagan
oh yes i am running xp pro on my notebook and have usb2 and powered firewire support. 1 gig of memory. it's a sony laptop. thank you tim
i haven't seen such for less than what a camcorder costs. it would be interesting to find something new. bob
rf i am looking at the sony dcr trv-280 but it records in high 8 whatever that is. t
and not what you asked for. did you change your mind? bob
no i just can't afford one. tim
what do other people use to get this done?
looks like an ati all in wonder pro and a camcorder. no one else ever chimed in. best to you and yours
