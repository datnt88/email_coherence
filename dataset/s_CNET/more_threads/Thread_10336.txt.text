would an ati video card run better on a motherboard with an ati chipset than a nvidia card of equal performance on the same motherboard or if you prefer to think in terms of nvidia would a nvidia card run better on a motherboard with a nvidia chipset than an ati of equal performance on the same of motherboard
using dual sli nvidia video cards.
i have an amd athlon64 with integrated ati radeon xpress 200. it has a pci express slot. i was gonna get nvidia but they &quot;recomend&quot; ati. i want to get a midrange card and cnet says the nvidia geforce 6600 gt is best. i'm not a big gamer so don't want the top end cards. ati has an ati radeon x800 xl but $300 is a bit much.
many computer companies ''recommend'' products because they have a supplier/advertising relationship. i would not let that stop me from getting an nvidia card.
