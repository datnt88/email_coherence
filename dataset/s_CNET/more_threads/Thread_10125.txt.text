hopefully, this may help someone before its too late. you're more than welcome to correct or add suggestions, but heck it works for me. cooling tips now that summer(or anytime) is here and that added heat is certainly present, cooling is ever more important. while, i can say for certain my system isn't in an a/c'ed room, it still does its job. why, you ask, because i follow common sense and a little knowledge goes a long ways. your situation maybe different but could use the information, i'm passing on, though repeated many times elsewhere. 1) clean the system case insides as best as possible 2) route wire harness and cables to better airflow(rounded cables?) 3) if possible mount hds apart from each other to reduce &quot;hot spot&quot; between them 4) use quality componets like bigger cpu fan/heatsink, extra case fan(s) 5) use your system away from direct sunlight or at least shield it 6) use system away from floor or place higher/elevate from floor blowholes, a handmade top of case hole to mount fan/or none to vent &quot;rising airflow&quot;. most cases if dual fans, one in front(in) and one in back(out) for airflow, mount extra fans to follow that convention, unless otherwise directed. replace power supply besides added wattage, using a dual fan setup itself. seriously consider removing the old hd if less than 10gb, maybe 20gb as your new hd is 60-200gb now. you're old hd did its job maybe for years and then you stuff a new hd on top or below it creates a hot spot, i practially guarantee the old hd will fail or cause the new one to become flaky within 3 months. by all means if you can cool the room to a lower temperature that the air being sucked in into the case will benefit, also called &quot;ambinent&quot; temperature. tada -----willy
other good tips would be to ensure that the shut down and alarm temperatures are set properly not only for the cpu, but for the gpu (if your gpu has this ability (lower end ones won't, but higher shelf gpu's such as geforce fx 5900's, geforce 6800's, geforce 7800's and so on, will)) another note on video cards is if possible put a fan over/near them in addition ensure the northbridge chipset is cooled properly, if it needs fan get it one, and don't buy a flaky one cooling the south bridge can also solve a lot of heat releated sound problems other things to note: if your machine is overheating, pull the side panels off if your audio pops, pull the side panels off, if it stops popping, you need to cut vents/get a new case in addition to getting a 2 fan psu, get a high quality 2 fan psu (or one with 1 really big fan) if your in a very hot climate and are trying to use a high performance pc, maybe underclocking for the summer could be an option if you have a basement, the pc will probably be cooler down there (if you don't have ac) rounded cables is a good suggestion, so is sleeving the power supply's cables (this is for advanced users that know how to sleeve them (it's not amazingly simple, you have to remove the heads and then re attach them, not hard but if you don't know what your doing you can ruin the whole thing) if you can't sleeve it zip ties would be a good idea cable management alwasy can help temps another good thing would be getting a good tim, such as artic silver ceramique (artic silver 5 is going to be about 5% better, and it costs nearly twice as much) just some more that i came up with up there, and i like your suggestion on sunlight especially
i dont like how you said keep it on the floor, i know this keeps it away from dust but it is actually cooler on the ground, also some of us have huge towers and crappy desks that cant support it. personally, i would not keep my side cover off. as this will disrupt your airflow as the side of the case acts as a &quot;duct&quot; so that it allows airflow through any air slits and such. leaving the case door off also allows even more dust to enter and exposes the fragile components to harm, e.g. pets, kids, etc. just not a good idea konny
as for floor system usage(nope), i meant if anything to eleveate off of floor. the dust bunnies can easily jump in and more readily clog the works. plus, if you have pets, the dander can too be a problem. i've seen some dirty and dusty situations and wonder why the system still works. as for my desk, it's a simple 6ft. folding table brought many moons ago. nothing fancy in this house. ah, yes i do have my cover off, but i didn't mention that as that's more the quick cure and house fan setup. since i tend to run my system runs 24x7, i do decide some mornings to shutdown as i won't be back until late, by that time, the house heat is pretty hot. -----willy
the air is cooler on the floor, but there tends to be more dust on floor also. one the things i do on most of my pc cases is cut out the section in the case where the fan is mounted so it is open and then get a wire fan guard. this will allow for more air flow than the stock fan openning on most cases. john
heat is a problem and eventually your processors life and computer will be shortened.i am running two hd's sata 120 g and a 660 xt video card, pent 4 915 3.2 and 1 g ram. cases used to have your specs bought a new case and modified you must have flow through. have one 120mm or 80 mm 28 to 35 cf in rear, same in front, should also have same in side panel blowing on cpu. you also could get new cpu cooler suggest zalman or i have thermalright cp 90 with artic silver compond. my new temps case when over cloaking case 30 hard drive 32 cpu 38. on idle case 24 hard drive 27 cpu 33 hope this helps
another huge help: if you have an amd athlon 64 cpu (or one of the newer semprons), make sure cool 'n quiet power management is enabled (power scheme set to minimal and the amd processor driver from amd.com installed). if you have an intel cpu... well, you obviously don't care about cool . also, use a high-efficiency power supply like the seasonic s12 series. the power supply doesn't generate as much waste heat and its 120mm fan helps system cooling. definitely make sure your next case has 120mm fans. antec makes some good ones.
willy; what's your opinion on installing the dual fan hd coolers that attach directly to the hd, and memory stick cool-covers? i have a really good heat sink cooler and two other 80mm fans (1 front and 1 back)installed already. sure would like to get your opinion on the cooling devices i mentioned above though. thanks a bunch! jobey m.
one of my computers is an old one that didn't have room for a case fan, so i added one of those &quot;fits in a slot&quot; cooling fans that blows out the back in a vacant slot. it dropped the tempurature of the primary hard drive by 10 degrees f. (verified by &quot;speedfan&quot; using built in hd sensor) about $10 for the fan i expect this will extend the life of the hard drive. this also reduced the tempurature of the exhaust from the power supply also, so everything is running cooler. also, i have found that just getting the system up 4&quot; will reduce the dust quite a bit, an old phone book or two works great. my cooling issues are in the winter; the heat blows down near where this computer sits; in the summer the a/c blows into the same spot, so it runs quite a bit cooler in the summer than in the winter. i could never run a pc in the summer without a/c in texas. when the a/c failed the last time the 2nd floor tempurature reached 118 degrees f. after two days. clayton
does the fan in front blow air across your hds??? if it dose your ok. if not you may want to add cooling to them. but any fan blow air across the hds will work. john
you said: &quot;my cooling issues are in the winter; the heat blows down near where this computer sits; in the summer the a/c blows into the same spot, so it runs quite a bit cooler in the summer than in the winter. i could never run a pc in the summer without a/c in texas. when the a/c failed the last time the 2nd floor tempurature reached 118 degrees f. after two days.&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ one of the reasons, i mentioned shielding or moving a system from direct sunlight. it was surprising that users just didn't understand having a system under direct sunlight couldn't possibility be the cause of added heat to the system. i understand being next to a window is great for viewing the outside, but there is a price to pay, system wise. if your system is direct path or your a/c, great a benefit, the flipside is in path of heat vent, not so good. why not have a movable platform(simple dolly on wheels) and move system to a less direct path. why, push you're luck. -----willy
you are right, moving your tower from the floor is the best thing you can do, but about the cooling thing, ok computers are made to support that type of stuff, if you have a computer and it comes with a fan, thats all you need, you dont need to put extra fans or bags of ice on-top of it to funtion properly. i leave my computer on 27/7/265.25 and never had a problem, i have 2 hard drives-not a problem, an extra 5 2.usbs-not a problem, a better ethernet card-not a problem.
i have 4 hardrives in my computer, 3 on top of each other. computer has been running this way {i never switch it off} for over a year, through the warmist june on record in a non a/c room, with no heat or hdd. problem. i have 1 extra fan blowing out at the top back of computer.
i use soyo motherboards to build my computers, and they have a display that shows at startup what the cpu temp is, plus a utility with a temperature display. i dont know that the temps that are shown are accurate, but they do show relative temperatures when they change. recently i noticed that the machine i'm currently using was running quite a bit hotter than when i built it. one hot day windows shut down because the temp had reached the danger limit i had set. when built the cpu temp showed an average of about 136* f. when it shut down it showed 170*. when i opened the case the first thing i did was remove the cpu heat sink fan. as i suspected, there was a thin layer of dust over the top of the cooling fins. very little air was being blown down between them. i cleaned them and, of course, all the case openings, etc. as well. now all is well and it's running at 136* again.
air flow depends upon the ability to push undesirable hot air out and pull cooling air in. sounds obvious but: imagine a straw with one hole at each end. it is simple to push air through the system as pressure is focused. now punch a series of holes and your not getting much air out, as seen by how you have to sit down after the effort :&gt; same with cutting holes in the case. the fans are not assisted by pressure to push the air out. same goes for just placing fans anywhere. my strategy is having the front case fan pull air in and the rear case as an exhaust. its just a matter of which way you face the fan. leaving the side covers off just invites dust and real bugs, not to mention the integrity of the case is compromised--- for those who stack hardware. my speciality is on software, yet the idea of memory and hd cooling fans is met with skepticism. same for the double cpu cooling fan. this is a great msg thread.
what i have done is put a floor fan in front of my computer or hang one in the area to blow cooler air around it.that makes it run alot better,been doing this for a couple years and it's made a big difference.
software cpu cooling can be very helpfull. allowing the cpu to cool durring all those unused cycles. it works expecially well on my athlon xp 1700+ which went from 115f to 97f normal temp. with cpuidle extreme. also big fans, my 120mm keeps my two hds at just a hair above room temperture most of the time.
mucho thanks for this tip.
i use a different method, i have the sides off the puter, with a small box fan on it all the time! never had a problem in 5 yrs!!
here's a great product i just happened to see in a favorite catalog. a pc stand w/wheels in &quot;home improvements catalog&quot; i've used this company for years for various &quot;good stuff&quot;.  #265919 mobile cpu stand $19.99. plastic. it adjust for width. sets right up. i keep my home alittle on warm side to save money. plus three cats with lots of fur. but i mainly got it to get my new hp media center up more to turn it on easier. some new pcs are so small making the button waaay down there to lean over and turn it on. (oh yeah lazy . helps your back though. but this has been a great help for many reasons. the pc fan grille stays much cleaner, i can reach the button, and move the pc if i need to to vacuumn. the room fan or air can circulate around the pc now. it's $19.99. i'm tight on money but this was a very worthwhile purchase for me. never dreamed there was a stand out there. i was searching the house for something to use. also if you have it up higher for the new ones you can still use the top to lay your papers or current projects on handy to the pc. i have to place my pc beside me, to the left due to lack of room but it's handy. my old pc was so tall i could use it as a little table for current notes cds & zip drives. i'm usualy frugal and did have an item stacked under it but this idea beats what i had. much airier for the pc and that's the point. hope someone else finds this stand useful too. like i said it's really wonderful for the newer samller units especially.
&gt;&gt; use system away from floor or place higher/elevate from floor &lt;&lt; i have a small 14&quot; tower (and cable modem) that is sitting on a plastic, milk crate like stand. besides keeping the computer off the floor, it raises its top to desktop level and i use the top for my mousepad. i have the opening of the stand facing the front of the computer so i can turn on / off my surge suppressor which is inside the stand. the holes in the back of the stand keep all the ac / coax / telephone / ethernet cables going to my surge suppresor from getting tangled. you can buy this type of stand at most office supply places as it is actually a hanging file folder holder.
&gt;&gt; sleeving the power supply's cables (this is for advanced users that know how to sleeve them (it's not amazingly simple, you have to remove the heads and then re attach them &lt;&lt; most electronic / electric supply houses should sell a much easier sleeving material. it is actually cut in a spiral configuration so it can be slipped over cables without having to remove the heads.
i like modding my case/set up. my latest is to mount a 80 mm fan in the right side of the case--ie, the side that is next to the motherboard. on the outside of this, one inch in from the sides, i mounted a spacer 3/4 inch thick and on top of that i placed an air filter. the fan fits through a hole and faces the internal racks for the harddrives so now i have clean filtered air blowing directly on these units==they are cool to the touch. the fan also lights up the case which i view thru the clear panel on the left side of the puter. (all parts scavenged except filter for total cost of $3) i ran for years without the sides mounted on the case until a dropped pen bounced into the case--nothing happened, but i was warned.
real milk crates are just the greatest, they're tough and re-usable, easily multi-purpose and best of all, return them if you get tired of them or pass them on. i have found those look-alike milk crates while decent do vary in quality and break more easily than the real mccoy, so placing too much weight shouldn't be over-looked. but, yeah, you seem to have a good setup going. i used to make shelves out of them and stash all sorts of papers, until i got some real shelving. tada -----willy
along with many of the common sense ways to cool your computer, there are also two major ways you can also keep your invesment cool. ------------------------------------- positive airflow vs negitive airflow ------------------------------------- ++++++++++++++++++ +positive airflow+ ++++++++++++++++++ -positive airflow is when you have more air flowing into your case than you have flowing out. -if you can constantly have cold air blowing in, then this works great. -its not the best because you will have more dust flowing in. -it may circulate already hot air thats trapped in your system. ***this only works well if you have a 120mm fan stuck to the side of your case that runs high rpm. it's not so good because the hot air takes longer to circulate out. if your room is constantly cold, then you might be able to pull it off*** ++++++++++++++++++ +negitive airflow+ ++++++++++++++++++ -negitive airflow is when your fans are sucking out more air than they are forcing in. -works well even in cramped or hot rooms. -circulates the hot air out a lot faster. ***i use negitive airflow, i also recommend it. blowing air on your componets are one thing, but it wont mean jack if your blowing hot air on them. so having a case setup to circulate new air in and circulate the onld air out even faster is, in my opinion, the smarter thing to do.*** my setup(good example of negitive airflow setup): +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ air blowing out- rear: 2x 80mm fans front bottom: one 80mm fan +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ air blowing in- side of case: one 80mm fan +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ neutral cooling- -cpu fan -video card fans -chipset fan -memory cooler -harddisk cooler +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ hope this helped! -alan
legalbob- i dont recommend filtering your fans because of dust build up. cooling performance could whind down because the filter will collect dust and wont be able to suck the dust out through your exausht fans. you'll be changing or cleaning filters more offten than using an aircan to clean you componets. those preciouse moments when the filters clog up before you clean them could cause unwanted damage. i only say this out of personal experience and research. you'll also notice that computer companies only use small mesh grilles at most. not because the companies want to rip you off, its because the companies know the danger of dust clogging airflow. dust can also start fires. remember always that filters are ment to do one thing- and that is to trap dust!!!! trapped dust = poor airflow
some cases have fans with a little switch for fan speed, rather than having it controlled by software. open up your case and see if your fans have any of these switches, and put them all up a notch. i've also heard that it's a good idea to have more fans blowing out than in. the fans blowing out will also pull in fresh air from the front. while we are focusing on airflow through the case itself, don't forget about airflow through your whole room. if you have windows on opposite sides of the room (or as opposite eachother as possible), open them both up. if you get a flow of air through your room, that will cool your room and therefore cool your box.
cooling addendum #2 ------------------- my first post on this topic generated abit of feedback. i had hoped in general terms that cooling tips would benefit those that read and passed along their tips. it seems it has, thanks. i like to add that cooling in general has been taken a serious step by vendors to provide &quot;bolt-on&quot; items to better cool your system. these are: 1) replace original cpu fan/heatsink(hsf) with a better rated one 2) add extra fan(s) on case or larger size fan(s) 3) use water cooling 4) replace case side covers, extra fan holes/exhaust 5) replace/wrap wire harness(better airflow) 6) relocate psu to bottom(depends) 7) use of buss/slot fans 8) use of refrigeration cooler or peltier units 9) better cases in general 10) laptop/notebook cooler any cutting, removal or additional work to a system case is considering &quot;modding&quot;. the term implies you've done something extra or done diy project beyond the norm. as everyone's system is different, what works for you is obviously better outcome. some users have relocated their system to custom cases(they build). as for up off floor statement, that was meant to imply to remove off floor to lessen dust intake and pet dander, etc.. it needn't be much, but some users have used milk crate. a small table does fine as well but again what works for you, is fine. please add your comments. thanks -----willy
