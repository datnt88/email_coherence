i was given a dell fp1900 monitor. it has a 19-pin plug for the screen [not for power]. of course this plug doesn't fit any port on my pc. where can i find a plug converter to mesh the monitor to the pc?

ya. dell calls it: &quot; 24-pin digital-only dvi connector &quot; i assume this is useable with a pc? but that end plug doesn't fit anything i own.
i found a vga connection under the screen. goes vga-vga no problem.
