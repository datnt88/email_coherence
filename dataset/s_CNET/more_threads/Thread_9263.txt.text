the definite answer is found at the hp support website for your model#. it will state the &quot;specs&quot; of your system and what ram it takes and the max. amount too. the quick and cheap way is to visit  and see what they state for your system. the possibility exists you may need sdr vs ddr ram, but that's an if only until you check. tada -----willy
if you have purchased the correct memory for your computer, you can install the ram then boot the computer. you can watch the boot screen to see the amount and type of memory that is detected at boot. that said, if you've never install memory, there are precautions that must be taken. here's a link to one set of instructions, but there are many more found with google.
i read the article i think i should be good to go, i will try later on and see if the comp. reads the memory.
