i have an ip camera that i want to place 400ft from the house in a building and i want to connect via access point or wireless router. i have a motorola/netopia 3347-02 wireless router in the house currently as well as a belkin f5d9231-4. is this possible or am i dreaming? any guidence would be appreciated.
have you researched wireless cam websites? it is possible, though you may have to upgrade your equipment a bit. it also depends on impediments (things in the way of signal) but it is possible.
you could always buy a small netbook, plug the webcam to it. place the webcam connected to the netbook connected to the router in a house near a window. start up the webcam. when you want to view the webcam do a remote desktop connection/protocol (rdp) to the netbook and view it from there. this is if it's wireless-n. (check specs to make sure you can connect wirelessly 400ft with wifi-n. i'm not 100% sure you can.)
