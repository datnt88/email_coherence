i'm trying to put a new 512 strip of ddm 2700 into my computer.. it has a 256 strip already. when i turn the computer on it goes on for threee seconds and turns off and then turns back on and does it over again. anyone got any ideas.. maybe a bad chip?
tell us mfg series and model # ? might find it in your system or mb manual you could also download/run &quot;cpuz&quot;
a 512??? have you tried it by itself?? if yes, and it is securely plugged in it make be incompatible with your mobo, or simply a defective stick.. did you check on the mobo, in advance to see what approved memory they show on their website???
