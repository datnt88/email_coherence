my computer has been acting up on start ups and never quite make it to the window's login screen without several reboots on startup. i replaced the power supply and the graphics card since the fan on both components were not spinning even though i had a successful start up. however my startup problem still persists and comes and go. sometimes, while i am online, the system will just reboot as if a ghost in the machine is in control. i've already tried formatting the hd and re-installing xp pro. the system is clean of any other software. are there utilities out there that let's me test the memory, hd, graphics card, and other components? is the software free?
and life goes on... jack
i think you misunderstand me. my computer is not sluggish nor does it have a virus. what i have is a hardware issue that i can't seem to pinpoint and i was wondering if there is a software out there that can assist with locating the hardware problem ( so that it can test the sound card, graphics card, memory, hd, cd rom, floppy, and anything else). thanks.
try the free/lite version first just to get a feel for it. the problem with these sorts of progs is that your not using the windows drivers, as long as you understand that then i suppose they are of some value. anyway the price is right so give it a test drive.
i went to their site and was so impressed i purchased the pro version. sharpwitz, geeks.com sells a diagnostic kit that traces the codes during post for under $30. this gadget installs on a pci slot. it comes with a booklet containing all the code definitions. it's helped me a few times. between the two of them you should be able to isolate the problem. sorry for the misunderstanding. and life goes on... jack
