i recently bought the netgear wg 511v2 wifi card for my dell latitude lap top with win xp pro operating system. prior to this card i have used belkins and linksys cards with no problems at all. ever since i have installed this card i continue to face problems when i try to put the laptop on stand by or shut down nothing happens, i have to hold down the power button for a few seconds to shut off the machine which is of course not the best way to work the computer. i have tried removing the wifi card restarting the machine and trying to put the laptop on stand by and all of it works just perfect. i have a feeling its got to do with the new card. any help will be appreciated..

i returned it for a model i know works. driver updates didn't cure it. bob
yes the firmware was the first thing i looked at and it is the most recent version. bob thanks for your feedback, i guess i will have to do the same...by the way it's been a while since i logged on here. it's good to see, you are still around showing directions to us that are lost
