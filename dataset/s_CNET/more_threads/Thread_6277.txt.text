my network admin has told me that a wireless access link takes up more bandwidth off of our network then a regular router. does anyone know if wireless takes up more bandwidth then a regular lan network?
i haven't heard this one before. you may want to just nod and move along. or ask for a web article showing such. sounds like another urban legend. best of luck, bob
due to the fact that the connection uses rf (radio frequency) there is probably more overhead. which could equate to a little more bandwidth. but unless you have several hundred wireless connections, it's probably not noticeable.
