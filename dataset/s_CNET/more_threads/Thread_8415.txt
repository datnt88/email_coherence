(i leave my computer one all the time) i go into task manager and it shows msmsgs.exe,internet explorer and lucallback.exe running. i googled the lucallback.exe which i didn't undersatnd as it says something about a proxy and also auto updates. my computer is set for auto updates but the time is set for 2:30 am, it is 6:30 when i get on my computer. the time and date are correct in the control panel. when i do a re-start it says that msmsgs.exe and explorer needs to close. i end the program, restart and everything is back to normal with the processor runnning between 1 and 4 %. any help would be appreciated. thanks wayne
