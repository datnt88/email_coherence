don't buy the 988 if you expect to get a rebate! i purchased an fp988d through tiger direct in november, submitted the rebate forms immediately, and 5 months later have yet to recieve my $90. i've spoken with ty, the head of their rebate department, he's a *@#%!? liar, not mention his &quot;flaming&quot; temper when i called him on his lies. bottom line - the monitor will cost you $90 more than the advertised price - buy a reputable brand from from a reputable vendor!
i had the exact same problem. no rebate for me either on my fuji monitor from tigerdirect. i will never shop at tigerdirect.com again. they offer great rebates on everything but you must pay more in advance and hope you get your rebate. i'll just pay an extra $20 next time somewhere else to avoid the hassle and risk of the rebate.
i sent in a meticulously filled out rebate form to fuji on 12/13/2005. it's now may 21st, 2006, and i've yet to receive it. rebates are a scam!
all it took was 2 phone calls and the check was in the mail knowing this delay i would buy again with this large rebate.
i brought this monitor from e-cost 6 months ago waiting for rerate.nothing ?i send 2 e-mail.1 letter to fujiplus and report to e-cost nothing happen even a reply.so i call it a scam.
