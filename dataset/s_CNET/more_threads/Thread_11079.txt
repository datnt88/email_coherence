1744	6	152191	1697534	1695026	chuckieu	1/25/06 11:07 am	1.13818722e12	was going by your comment....	about firewire not working well on pcs. have seen you make it before. even though i may not need it, i insist that any mobo i use include it, and the case have a front plug. haven't moved to 64-bit yet, but have a nice socket 939 board picked out that supports 1394a. cheers. chuck
