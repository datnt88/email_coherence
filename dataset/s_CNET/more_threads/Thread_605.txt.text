hello, i am planning a new itx-build computer and i'm a bit unsure as to a video card. ideally, i would like to find a card that could sound as well as video through the hdmi port. would most video cards with an hdmi port be capable of sound output, or would i need to look for a special feature on the card? (also, i have no real plans on gaming on it. the most graphically demanding operation is probably just playing blu-ray on it. if i can find a slim blu-ray drive.) here is the case and motherboard i am planning on purchasing in case this has any affect on a recommendation.   thanks!
this means you're going with some sandybridge cpu which will have on board graphics that should be capable enough for everyday use. have you selected the exact processor you want and checked to see which intel graphics offering it has? i might suggest something in the i5 range due to possible heat considerations and you don't need the unlocked versions. you might want to put the box together and see how well it does before adding a discrete video card.
intel's sandy bridge graphics are (finally) respectable. unless you want to do some gaming, the integrated graphics are perfect for in an itx form factor.
i was thinking of getting the i7-2600 (non k version). if i were to go the discrete card route, would any potential card with an hdmi port fit the bill of being able to output sound as well?
