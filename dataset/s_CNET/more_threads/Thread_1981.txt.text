i am having problems with a keyboard on a pc running windows xp. when i press backspace it opens internet explorer. i have looked everwhere and can not find a solution to this. any help would be great. thanks
start - settings - control panel - keyboard - make sure it is set to us default look at the keyboard mappings, character settings etc. it got changed somehow - possibly malware.
when a keyboard starts messing up like you describe the first things to do are to unplug and replug the keyboard to see if that fixes it. next is to reboot, third is to test another keyboard.
