lately my computer has been freezing in the midpoint of sleep mode, i have no idea why. ive looked into i and people say it could be i need to clean my registry, so ive done that and i even tried yesterday and i had no registry files that needed to be cleaned, now i have no idea why its doing this at all. please help!
have you scanned for viruses? there are several good free programs, available, such as avast and avg. but i think avast is the best, there is a really good blog that has reviews of virus software and talks about computer issues such as yours, &lt;a href=&quot;  &gt;  &lt;/a&gt;
well ive scanned and scanned again with my mcaffee software and found nothing. do i need another anti virus software?
