hi. i've a sony dru-530a dvd burner(with recently upgrade firmware 2.1c) on a dell dimension 4550. i've 640 in ram and the processor runs at 2.53mghz. well, the problem is that i've ripped some dvd movies, and then copied then on dvd -r media, i've tried(memorex, tdk and verbatim), and when i finish, they all play well on the computer dvd, but when i put them on my sony dvd player in the living room, i get some still screens and some skips. all of them are like that, and i've tried in different dvd player that support the dvd -r/+r and so forth. i've use cyberlink dvdcopy, dvd shrink, nero burning room. i've burn at different speeds also, and i got the same problem. i've disable any background program while burning, and leave the computer alone to do its job, but it is the same. i go see the movie, it plays really well, but then some scenes in the movie get still for seconds or skip. i would love help, since i don't know what to do. i just feel like throwing my dvd burner to the garbage. thanks.
&quot; they all play well on the computer dvd, but when i put them on my sony dvd player in the living room, i get some still screens and some skips. &quot; i had this apex dvd player that i gave away. why? it did that on dvd+r and dvd-r from any machine/drive. you need to try another dvd player. in closing, i am thinking the 4x media should be burned at 2x, 8x at 4x and so on. just a nagging feeling it works better. no websites to back me up, just me. bob
i've tried burning at different speeds, usually as you said, lower than the maximum speed available. the tdk 4x, i've burned them at 2x and the memorex and verbatim 8x at 4x and even at 2x, but basically same result. thanks any way for trying to help out, i do really appreciated it. edwards.
you still need to try another player. that was my issue, and nothing we do will fix that player. bob
