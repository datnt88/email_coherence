does anyone know if apple is ever going to add a customizable equalizer to the ipod? thank you everyone, chusito1975
&quot;i can give you a definite perhaps or even a positive maybe that the customizable equalizer will be built into the ipod before the end of the millennium&quot; or, your guess is as good as anyone else's, given that apple are very quiet about future plans p
i was hoping to get a response from you. right now i have been using the &quot;jazz&quot; setting on the equalizer. it's the one that sounds the best when using the included ipod headphones. i have been shopping around for &quot;in ear&quot; bud headphones, but do not know which ones to get. any suggestions? thanks again, chusito1975
actually, snap! i also used to use the jazz - best mix of quality overall... about earphones - whats your budget?? about the eq, you can create custom eq for - not on - the ipod...  hope helps/..
