the door on my superdrive won't open using the button on the door or with eject from toast software, i have a firewire drive attached and it does open from toast. superdrive is a pioneer dvr-103. computer is power mac g4 733 digital audio running os x 10.2.8. drive shows up on system profiler and on toast. do i have a bad drive?
i found the problem, the tray was jammed against a piece of plastic under the tray. fiddled a bit and unjammed it. i do have another issue though. in os x the profiler says burning is fully supported but i can't burn files without making a disc image of the file first. the disc works fine on the mac but doesn't read on a pc. my version of toast only works on classic, do i have to get toast for os x to burn cross platform discs?
this is probably a function of your old version of toast. you really should be moving away from anything &quot;classic&quot;. the os x version of toast will burn just about anything, including pc compatible disks, dvd, d/l dvd, cd and all the other neat stuff. toast 6 titanium os x version, is the earliest version you should be looking for but toast 7 would be nice. happy burning p
