first off, apologies if this was already asked. i searched the forum, but found no solution to my particular problem. i'm having problems detecting my hard drive. now, what i did: got a new 160gig hd (my slave, d: ) and installed it. i was able to format (via: admintools &gt; comp mgmt &gt; disk mgmt) it and put some data onto it. i formatted and reinstalled winxp pro onto my master hd. both were formated as ntfs. no problem. now, when i went to mycomputer, my d: didn't show up. i checked the jumpers, the bios and device manager, they all say the hd shows up/is running okay. went back to the diskmgmt screen and the hd is innactive. right clicking on it prompts me to change it to a basic volume (which would delete everything) in order to use it - which i obviously can't do since i have some data i need on it. what can i do to view the drive???
for instance, xp doens't support over 127gb drives until sp1. this drives people to frantic states since many will install xp and such a drive will do as you wrote. next the drive, if not partitioned with xp may indeed vanish. bob
you were right! the service pack upgrade was the issue. very much appreciated! -chin
many lose the drive contents over that one. just asking. why didn't you tell you had reinstalled the os?
