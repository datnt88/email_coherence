i am setting up a small office ie. 4-5 workstations and wireless network. i need to have printing capacity as well for all workstations. i am wondering if it is better to buy smaller printers for each station or to network them all to one bigger printer. does anyone know how i could best research answers to this question? thanks.
color inkjets will soak most budgets and personal laser printers are the bane of the office except when you deal with the boss (they get their own!) my answer is one bigger laser printer plus one. i offer no research, just decades of &quot;been there, done that.&quot; bob
depending on how much work will be sent to the printer it might be more cost effective to have one heavy duty printer as opposed to four or five cheaper units. keep in mind that the big cost of any printer is ink or toner. a small printer may be as cheap as fifty dollars but the replacement ink can be about the same price. the draw back to having just one printer is the fact that things break down and you might be left with print jobs hanging in the air should it fail. you'll just have to weigh the pro's and con's against you're budget and requirements to see what solution best fits your needs. good luck
