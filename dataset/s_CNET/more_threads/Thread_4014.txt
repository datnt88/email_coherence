(will also try changing channels on the router and repeater)

1568	7	228049	2386249	2385388	newfuturevintage	1/26/07 1:43 pm	1.16981898e12	whew! resolved...	you were right, it's the laptop interfering with the router...i had reset the router and updated firmware, to no avail....when i realized i didn't even need to have the wireless card in the unit to cause the problem, interference as the source of the problem came clear. so, and this hurts, the easy fix: i changed channels to 11 from 1 on the ap and extender and it solved the problem. looks like the combination of 1.6 ghz cpu clocking + the lot of 'other' clocking in the laptop generates hash into the 2.4ghz signal of the ap. moving the network signal moving higher into the spectrum took care of it. let's hope none of my neighbors go gung ho on channel 11 thanks to everybody!
