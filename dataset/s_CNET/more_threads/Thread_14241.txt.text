hey i have 1 gt 640 and i play cod4 and looking into upgrading my video. what would be better? how fast would 2 dual nvidia gt 640 vs 1 nvidia gtx 660 ti be? i run a ok 250fps on my 1 gt 640 now but with a super low config file and rez set to 1440.
that's a big jump. that parallel stuff....2xgt.....might turn out to be a big headache. make sure you have a psu that can handle that card.
i find those with dual and more cards to be too hard to support. or rather the problems often mean we have to re-vamp the machine to get it to work as well as they expected. a single card is the easy path. your choice but if you go with dual cards, be sure you have support on hand and a thick wallet. bob
&quot;dual cards&quot; has always been a problem in the long run. to me, dual worked well only during the demo days (at a computer show in my land). thereafter, it was one problem after another. had to go back to single card coz support for dual wasn't free a-tall. suit yourself.
great for demos!
thanks all, that pretty well says it gtx is the go! i only just joined cnet and got answers that night. love it! thanks again
