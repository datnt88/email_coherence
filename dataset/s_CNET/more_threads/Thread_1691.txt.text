is this a good card? i plan to buy this because there's a $45 rebate on it. my other choice is a gigabyte gv-n96tsl-1gi video card. what cards do you recommend?
might be that silent model. just make sure your machine has the required power supply then why not?
i actually bought an antec 550 watts bpu500 plus power supply. is this good enough?
but i read your posts in this discussion twice and while 550 is more than enough for the average machine i can't tell if you have a full tower case with 8 hard drives or anything out of the ordinary. in spite of that, 99% of the time your average machine will be fine with that size. bob
i just plan to install 1 hard drive, 1 video card, dvd burner, 2 additional hard drive fans. that's basically it
