can i use a preexisting wifi adapter connected to a wired computer to extend my wifi range?
so far the common names have not implemented mesh networking. my netgear wpnt834 goes some 200 plus feet down the street two doors down and works well in the neighbors kitchen. are you sure it's not a settings issue? (see the forum sticky) bob bob
you could install a cantenna or some form of legal booster antenna. they have omnidirectonal and directed so pick your poison
that's actually the same router i have but, it's down stairs in my basement. in my backyard(about 40 feet through 2 walls and a brick wall away)i get a weak signal with my mom's laptop.my desktop is upstairs on the other side of my house about 40 feet away and it's wired.i used the adapter that paired with the router before i wired my desktop. the only reason i'm wanting to extend the wifi reach because i'm geting a smartphone soon and wanted to make sure i could connect throughout my entire house even a distance from my house. if i can use that spare adapter to increase the range can you tell me how?
mine is up on the 2nd floor and has stellar coverage. bob
i did update it's firmware. now they do have some firmware version checker in the router but it didn't find the newer version so i did it the old fashioned way (look on the web site...) bob
do you have the problems with that router droping the internet connection?
if you disable ssid broadcast, i see it drop. bob
