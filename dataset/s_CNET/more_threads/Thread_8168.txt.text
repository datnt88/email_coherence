android tablets toshiba thrive and 7 inch klu tablet. how do i save or transfer data from hard drive to sd card? thank you
covers this but some folk are new to android and find it a little challenging. but es file explorer is what i use to copy pictures around. bob
very few tablets support a hard drive so i'm going to answer that you use a personal computer for that. however, how about dropbox to move such things? bob
