i have a asus p4sd-la running a intel cpu i have been trying to enable the ht (hyper-threading) from what i can find out it need to be turned on it bios but when i look in it its not there hp was no help and i cant seem to be able to find out anything online at the award or asus site ....already flashed the bios ...was just wondering if any one knows how to get it up and running acording to all the documentation everything supports ht just need to find out how to enable..........thank you all
look at your hardware configuration under device manager. click on processors. how many do you show? if you show 2, ht is enabled and recognized. asus boards come with a nice manual. they have several pages on bios configuration. the book should contain this. if you have not manual, they can be found and downloaded on the asus site. on my asus board, the ht setting is under advanced/cpu configuration. see if you have anything like this.
i didn't have to do anything to make this work. if you have a ht enabled cpu, and have either xp pro or xp home with sp1 slippstreamed into the distorbution media, then ht worked fine for me. i got in a older hp media cenetr pc that was stripped except for the cpu and mobo. three finger csalute the machine and see how many cpus taskmanager sees. if that doesn't work i will look in the bios.
