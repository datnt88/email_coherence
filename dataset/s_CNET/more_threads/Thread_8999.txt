459	4	385862	3263700	3263307	steven haninger	3/8/10 2:07 pm	1.26805722e12	it's as simple as copy and paste	you don't need any kind of wizard to transfer data from a hard drive to a flash drive. the reason i mentioned going with ntfs is only if you have some very large files as fat32 has something of a 4gb limit and folks who download movies and stuff can have some fairly large files. if you don't do that, there's no problem. the flash drive is seen in explorer just like any other drive. you can select files or entire folder and just copy and paste them from one drive to the other. as for the flash drive being bootable after that....sorry...nope. it's possible to make a flash drive bootable to run some utilities but not windows.

459	6	385862	3264224	3263700	stephenszpak	3/9/10 8:24 am	1.26812304e12	we're getting there	thanks steven (yes, explorer sees my 2 gb flash chip as drive e. i noticed that a while back.) but as i said (not talking about a flash chip now): &quot;so people get a usb hard drive (my guess) and do the files and settings transfer wizard thing...&quot; i think in a round about way this may have been answered. (forget about the flash chip for now.) if my drive c crashed and i had transfered everything to a usb hard dirve by using the wizard in windows... would the computer boot up from the usb port with the usb hard drive cabled to it? it seems you're saying no, and there is no easy way to create a bootable full disk back up. thanks, and sorry about the confusion here. i hope we're close to the end. -stephen
