hey, everyone im about to build a new pc and i'd like some advice on what parts i should be buying my budget is about 1900-2200$ thanks yp.
almost forgot im thinking about playing games like crysis cod4 supreme commander coh yp.
i'm in the same situation as you are. same budget and everything. anyway, this is the setup i'm most likely going with: intel core 2 duo e6750 evga nforce 680i sli nvidia socket 775 atx motherboard 2x corsair dual channel 1024mb pc6400 ddr2 800mhz evga geforce 8800 gts 640mb western digital caviar se16 500gb hdd sony dru830a cd/dvd burner silverstone, fp34 black internal 26-in-1 card reader/writer drive ocz gamexstream 700-watt power supply thermaltake kandalf lcs case windows xp professional that's what my list looks like at the moment, but i don't think it will be changing a whole lot. this is about what our budget will allow. of course, you could always go with a less expensive case in order to get more memory, better gpu, or better cpu. good luck.
that's a good setup except it looks like you're sticking with on-board sound. you can find an x-fi gamer for about $40 and it will give you better sound quality and higher framerates when compared to integrated sound.
thanks for help man, yeah im kind of thinking about a sli setup thanks for all the rest though
it is pretty close to what you want. and about $1900.
replaced the e6600 with an e6750 and kicked up that psu, that would be pretty good right there.
yeah i was looking at intel new line of processors and i though i'd take that new e6850, my friend is selling it to me on 275$ and a case that came with a 1000watt psu for 280$ also im getting that gamer fatal1ty sound card for 130$ and im going for 2 8800gts but the 320mb model thanks for all the help though i whole machine will come at2087$ with tax included so i guess is a good piece of hardware
firstly, its impossible to build a computer to pre-empt unreleased games secondly, directx 10 was made obslete at the announcement/release of directx 10.1, not to mention that game development for the pc has become questionable at best (due to the popularity and equality of consoles, contrasted to the massive performance delta between the average pc and the performance pc). thirdly, nvidia and ati are planning to release new graphics processors in about 5 or 6 months, replacing geforce 8 and radeon hd 2xxx. also, theres no real advantage to having a creative card (don't really care what anand says) over integrated audio, in regards to quality, performance, etc
