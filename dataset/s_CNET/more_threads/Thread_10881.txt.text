hello everybody, i have a rather awkward problem most of the times i try to watch a movie in my pc. the moment i insert the dvd disk in and starts to read then all of a sudden the pc automatically restarts. i have a pentium 4 in 3.0 ghz with windows xp home, 512 mb ram, 80gb hard drive, liteon dvd-rw, and a vga 128mb pci-express. the problem doesnt appear in all dvd movies but in the majority of those. with common dvd (software content) and cds there is no problem at all. thanks
it turned out to be the sound driver. this one had driven many tech insane as all cds worked as well as mp3s and many dvds. i will not dive into the gritty details but the theory is the dvd used the 5.1 stereo portion of the audio driver and that is where i guess the flaw was. finding the latest driver was not easy since it was some oem motherboard by fujitsu-siemans. but a little sleuthing and we found it. your issue sounds oh so familiar. bob ps. and yes, the microsoft update driver button announced it had the latest drivers. i wonder if they'll ever fix that.
if your processor isnt getting enough power from your power supply unit then your system will reboot itself under the strain. p4 3.0ghz cpus draw quite a lot of power so if you continue to have this problem later in life then i would look at upgrading your psu........
