has anyone had any problems with the lightscribe function on the lite-on ihas422-08 dvd burner? i have ready around the net that certain dvd brands do not work. is that true?
i have one other than hp lightscribe and so far i've used hp and verbatim media and lightscribed them. of course you will find people with problems. the pcs out there are a varied lot with many in need of repair. bob
have you checked that or checked with the mfg for 'compatible media'? vapcmd
