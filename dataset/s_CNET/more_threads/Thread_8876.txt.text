i want to revive an old pc based on an asus a7v266-e motherboard. the only part missing is a video card (i have a pci card but i would rather use an agp one). my motherboard accepts up to 4x agp video cards. although i found many of them, they are generally more expensive than 8x cards and also have less video memory. i also found that some 8x cards are backward compatible with 4x slots (some are even compatible with 2x slots). i would like to know if all 8x agp video cards are backwards compatible with 4x. i really would appreciate any input and/or suggestions. dimitri
i have yet to fit an 8x only card. bob
just make sure the agp card you choose/install is based on 1.5v. older agp cards were 3.0v. vapcmd
