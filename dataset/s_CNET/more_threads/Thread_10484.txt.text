is there any way to use an old cpu for a network storage unit. i thought i read somewhere that this could be done. anyone know how? dale
get a router and add the old one to the network. set up file and printer sharing. install an os (so it will boot and run) and use the drive for storage.
check out this link:
i have an ftp server at home (3com 3cserver). it is just an old pc with several hard drives. i can use my browser to connect using &quot; ftp://10.0.0.50&quot; in the url. i like it better than microsoft &quot;file and print sharing&quot;. it is all about preference. i find the ms protocols very chatty. this is ok on an ethernet switch with 100 meg of full duplex bandwidth but i want my wireless only sending necessary traffic. skrall
