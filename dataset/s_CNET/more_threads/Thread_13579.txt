11484	2	502210	5069539	5069394	steven haninger	1/23/11 2:35 pm	1.2957933e12	don't know about gigaworks but i have the klipsch	promedia 2.1 and it's served me well for quite some time. i don't game but i do enjoy music at reasonable quality. it's really a matter of adjusting the bass to the right level as any sub-woofer can get muddy sounding. my main home speaker system is still a pair of old jbl l65s ( a studio monitor series) that spoils me but the klipsch are nice on my pc. i don't need or want more than 2.1. good luck in your search but it's your ears that should do the judging.
