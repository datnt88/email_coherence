i just bought a laptop and also have a 21 inch desktop monitor hooked up to my existing desktop. i know a kvm switch will allow me to connect the two together but is there anything i should check for before i buy one? any recommendations? what does &quot;autoscan&quot; mean in reference to a kvm switch? thank you.
about $30. but why do you need that with a laptop? you just want a bigger display?
i just want a larger display.
