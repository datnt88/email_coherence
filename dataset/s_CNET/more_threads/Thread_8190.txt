3549	0	333952	2998421	nr	jangus1	3/9/09 3:20 pm	1.236612e12	driver question	i have an old hp compaq presario laptop (sempron-cpu) which has an ati mobility radeon express series 200 graphics card. xphome sp-2. i have a driver dated dec/2005 (8.202.0.0) for it, and is the latest, as far as i know. i have located an newer &quot;amd catalyst&quot; driver, which indicates that their driver supports my graphics card. since ati is amd now, my guess is that it may be ok. i hate to guess about things like this, and am just inquiring here. can anyone verify that the catalyst drivers are ok with my old laptop ? thanks
