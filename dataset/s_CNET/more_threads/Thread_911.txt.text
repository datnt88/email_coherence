macbook osx maxtor external hd 250 gb i recently switched over to macs from an hp pc computer. i have a maxtor external hd that went along with the pc and i saved all of my music/videos/movies on the hd so that i could bring them into my new laptop. i've installed the cd that came with the hd and while i can delete/copy/bring files into my computer, i cannot add or bring anything into the hd from my mac. i've scoured over google/this forum/the world for an answer and i have yet to come across one. please help!!!
you'll have to copy out the files you want to save then format the drive in an apple supported file system. bob
how'd you manage to see the files?!! hope you don't mind me ask, i am also riddled with a similar scenario after purchasing a macbook pro and selling my netback. i have a military grade maxtor external hd and i can not even seem to be able to find it when plugging it into my mbp via the usb portals. please help anyone!! =( arnold
if the osx is dates it can't see the ntfs (file system) and files. current versions can see ntfs volumes just fine. there is also other solutions like having a friend with a pc copy then out to dvd or another hdd. i've used linux (ubuntu to be specific) to connect 2 hdds, one in ntfs and the other in afs and drag the files over. macfuse is worth some research if your osx is outdated. bob
my macbook pro is brand new up to date. i had windows xp on my netbook, and this sucks. lol the situation, that is.
something's amiss. try cnet's apple forums. here it just worked. on the new machines ntfs just works. bob
