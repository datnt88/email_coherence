i am looking for a sleek external bluray drive, it must be able to write dvd &amp; cd's as well. i bought a laptop without an optical drive and i want to be able to throw an external drive in my laptop case and have it for trips (watching blurays, burning cds, etc). i have 2 questions: 1) i have usb 3.0 capabilities, should i take advantage of that on this purchase? 2) what should i buy?
when i can't decide i hit the amazon best sellers list.   is the first hit. bob
country: us gotta love amazon, didn't realize they had a best sellers section. should have known. any ideas on whether or not i should take advantage of the usb 3.0 port on this or stick with usb 2.0?
usb 2.0 is fast enough for writing to media and with some machines with usb 3.0 troubles only you know if your dell has been updated and cured. sorry but i rarely check to see if a member has revealed king and country information and with many from across the world i've learned to toss in a caveat or question. bob
