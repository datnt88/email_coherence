ok i'm a gamer, pc &amp; console games, i play everyday and i also disconnect from the internet randomly, 2 technican came by, they said i was all set/streight, but im still disconnecting like crazy, like every 30 mins, so i have to this everytime unplug cable, then power, wait 30 secs reconnect all that stuff, then it takes 1-5 mins to reconnect, then disconnects, what could be my problem?
what happens if there is no wifi involved? some folk run those torrents but that's something no one knows to complain about. bob
i hooked my modem directly to my xbox, and it still disconnects i thought it was my router at first....
if we look at how xbox networks, you should get disconnects.
