okay, so i know little about the inner workings of pc's, but i'd like to upgrade mine. basically all i want is to be able to play most games without slowdown and the like. i currently have an emachines e4028, and was wondering what sort of upgrades would be suitable. i have tried looking at graphics cards, but i just get confused. someone has offered me an 'xfx pv-t34k-nahg 5200 nvidia agp' graphics card, but apparently i already have 128mb in onboard graphics? oh, and i am on a budget, being a student! if anyone could help i'd seriously appreciate it. cheers, james
i didn't find it on the us emachine site. bob
i'm in the uk.
i didn't actually realise this was a us site! is this a problem for me?!
open the case and tell me which slots are open and what type. see this for pictures.  bob
no graphics upgrade will be worth it compared to the built-in gma900 graphics. a pci graphics card might be a little bit better but certainly won't handle games like fear, doom, call of duty, etc. &quot;without slowdown&quot;.
if you can find it, the pci version of the 256mb fx5700 is worth doing. many games will be &quot;ok.&quot; bob
