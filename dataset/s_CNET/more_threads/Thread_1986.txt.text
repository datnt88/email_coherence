hi, i have one usb hard disk. recently when i connect it in my computer it connect to computer even i can access it from cmd also i can see it in device management but my i cant see the drive (usb) in my computer note that i can open (not explore) it from device management but no address showing in the address bar. pls help me regard this.
can you tell a little bit more? - what exactly does &quot;access it from cmd&quot; mean? does it have a drive letter? does dir work? does chkdsk work? - what do you mean with &quot;open in device manager&quot;? what does it show? - what does disk management say about the disk? - what happens if you connect the hard disk to another pc? does it behave normally or just as strange? - what happens if you connect a usb-stick or another hard disk to this pc? does it behave normally or just as strange? - maybe the drive letter has been marked to be hidden. download tweakui to check:  kees

some of viruses in your usb just scan your usb with some of good anti virus. and also i share one superb news i buy some tapes from tape4backup.com and i have received usb free as a gift.
i just bought a new memory stick for cv ad letters, started working fine but now it gets red hot and dos'nt show on laptop?
and what happens if you use it at another laptop/pc? kees
