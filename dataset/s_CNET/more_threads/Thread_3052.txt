3656	6	251570	2511084	2511008	leeroybrowwn	6/11/07 7:01 am	1.18154526e12	yes	i wanna blank the hard disk ! lol i used dban on it and it detected 2 partitions ide - 000 and ide - 001 ! i didnt choose automatic and yes i wasnt sure what i was doing ! so i guess what i did was use quick erase on the 001 partition .... then i reinstalled xp from the recovery disks . then i was gonna try to install my own xp home not a recovery disk. and when i got to the part when u can delete the partition it said that the partition was a system partition ... so i didnt do it ! all im asking is .... will i have a problem if i erase this so called system partition? your advice would be much appricated .

3656	8	251570	2511194	2511247	leeroybrowwn	6/11/07 9:50 am	1.1815554e12	ok so	what tour sayin is i can do a clean install of xp but maybe my restore disks wont work any more?
3656	9	251570	2511304	2511194	r. proffitt	6/11/07 9:56 am	1.18155576e12	that's correct.	to use recovery cds we must follow their instructions. if we use xp cds then we use what you see on the internet. of course this begs the question if avertec has proper restore cds. such (in my opinion) should work when we put in a new black drive since hard disks do fail. your choice on the matter but why not wipe the drive and find out? bob

3656	11	251570	2511334	2511291	r. proffitt	6/11/07 10:18 am	1.18155708e12	dban would never affect a cd boot.	if cd boot fails then that is caused by &quot;something else.&quot; i noted dban but i can remove partitons with gnome tools too. maybe the issue you haven't pulled the trigger on this? some fall into analysis paralysis. or want an authoritive answer, a manual, step by step, etc. i can only be clear on one thing. if i can't boot a cd, it's not due to what's on or not on the hard disk. bob
