10161	7	334601	3007265	3002029	rob kish	3/20/09 6:40 pm	1.2375744e12	magic jack	i've had one for about 6 months and it works great, no complaints whatsoever. reception has been very clear but it does seem to work better with some phones than others. i have the highest speed cable modem which might help. using on a vista hp laptop. again, on some phones, entering data from the phone, e.g., a credit card number, can be unreliable. seems to work better with a 2.4 mghz phone than a 5.8. it was worth the money, that's for sure. it's paid for itself in long distance calls many times over.

10161	9	334601	3007303	3007265	popa41	3/20/09 7:20 pm	1.2375768e12	works for me...	i've had mine for about six months now. never had a problem with it. everyone i talk to on it says the sound quality is excellent. from what i can gather from the complaints people have, i've come to (2) conclusions: either they are using lousy phones, or have lousy internet service. i use a wired phone on mine. have toyed with the idea of using a wireless but haven't gotten around to it yet. my internet service is excellent. so there you are, the (2) variables. let me say this. i'm paying $16 dollars a month for local phone service from at&t. they then charged me $10 a month for (2) hours of long distance service every month, whether i used (2) hours or not (which i don't). so i dropped the long distance service from at&t and use the magic jack for long distance service only. since i paid $30 for the magic jack on e-bay and i've had the thing for (6) months, i'm already money ahead. would i use it as my primary phone, never. but for long distance service, it's a winner.

10161	11	334601	3007406	3002029	prberg	3/20/09 9:40 pm	1.2375852e12	magicjack is cool!	hi, here is my magicjack experience. i've had it for about 6 months. i'm pretty happy with it. you do have to factor in the cost... you do get what you pay for. the sound quality, customer service, and reliability are not as good as a land line. but for me it's good enough.. i just cancelled my land line a few weeks ago (i do have a cell phone too). calls sound good most of the time. i had an old laptop lying around so i made that my 'magicjack' computer. i can leave it on and it doesn't use much power. i did read something about it cutting off your calls after an hour (then you have to call the person back again). but overall i'm satisfied.

10161	13	334601	3007450	3002029	richchrono	3/20/09 11:05 pm	1.2375903e12	had it. tossed it.	it was hit and miss for me. worked sometimes, not others. xp or vista didn't seem to matter. sound quality was hit and miss, too. a few months into service, the voicemail stopped working. if i didn't answer, the caller would get a voice that said &quot;goodbye&quot;... click! they never did get it working. when it came time to re-up for another year, i trashed it.

10161	16	334601	3007787	3002029	john3347	3/21/09 11:28 am	1.23763488e12	not what it is advertised	like so many other things, my experience is much less than what is advertised. voice quality is inconsistent, sometimes good - sometimes terrible; never excellent. voice mail sometimes just does not work. have spent total of a few hours with tech support trying to make service consistent. finally they just offered me a refund, which i declined because i need the phone for the occasions that i will be on the phone for an extended period of time (calls to public utilities, etc.). i have since purchased a second magicjack so friends in another state can call me as though i were still local to them. (magicjack is regularly adding service in new areas) if you have reliable cell phone service or wired home phone, magicjack can be a suitable auxiliary, special use phone, but not reliable enough for one's primary phone. in summation, while the unique service is worth $20/year to me as an auxiliary phone it, unfortunately, does not replace a reliable home phone.

10161	26	334601	3217583	3002029	gitterdunn	1/9/10 7:12 am	1.26302112e12	magic jack	i have used the magicjack for a year & just renewed it for 5 years. it's performance depends a lot on the quality of your isp. you must have dsl or another kind of high speed connection. you must leave your computer on to receive calls. when your computer automatically updates & reboots itself, you may get an error msg saying &quot;broken storage&quot;. this will require you to reformat the drive that mj is on. when you do this, you lose your stored contact list. other than these glitches, it works very well & has saved me lots of money.

10161	28	334601	5117554	3002029	mrlucky718	4/15/11 9:08 am	1.30285848e12	magic jack phone service	works great for me. i have used it going on 2 years. you must have a good broadband service if your picky about sound quality. i no longer have a land line. you must set up udp ports 5060 an 5070 on your firewall for good flow thru or the sound will be choppy. i like it that my phone number is no longer listed, cuts down on sales calls. forwards all voice mails to your email inbox. i use multiple (5) uniden dect 6 phone system with mine and it works great. it has caller id and you can forward your calls to your cell phone or any phone you want to. free conference calling! call any where in the us or canada!
