4775	2	191127	2070276	2070060	hairymon	7/14/06 1:35 pm	1.1528841e12	i understand this but is it strictly the ram/processor?	the fact that even the laptops had some amount of delay makes me think it's more than that (though upgrading would certainly help)? i saw one forum that mentioned something about setting dns for your local server vs. that of your isp being part of the problem. again, while the win 98 computers were definitely set for replacement anyway, just want to make sure; we don't want to buy upgrade everything else and still have the same issue, thanks.

4775	6	191127	2071421	2070310	hairymon	7/15/06 5:28 am	1.15294128e12	i agree with that	2 of the 4 machines had problems (not nearly as severe) on the old network. and as i said, i had plans to replace them not long after the network upgrade, so now i'll just replace them before. but again, i'm wondering what the issue is with the win xp pro machines.....
