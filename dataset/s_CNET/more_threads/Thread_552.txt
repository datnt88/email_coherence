2067	0	166901	1847487	nr	mjraine1	3/31/06 9:09 am	1.14379614e12	wireless print server	i installed a wireless printserver with my epson printer which connects through my wireless router. the print server has to be connected via the wireless router and the 10/100 connection. the pc, wireless router and printer are all located upstairs in my office. this works fine. i can print from my wireless laptop downstairs to my printer upstairs. my question is - can i connect another stand alone wireless printserver to my printer downstairs without connecting via the 10/100(which is upstairs)to access a wireless printer downstairs. another words a stand alone printer server(802.11g) that will work with the downstairs printer????? mike

2067	8	166901	1852813	1852684	linkit	4/3/06 12:50 pm	1.1440686e12	yes	that is the general idea with any print server. if you can connect a print server to a router, then any printer you connect to the print server will be available for any computer that is also connected to the router. the router doesn't care how you connect a print server to it--you can use a network cable or a wireless signal. the wireless signal performs the same function as a network cable. wired print server: wireless router --- print server --- printer wireless print server: wireless router ~ ~ ~ wireless print server --- printer key: --- network cable ~ ~ ~ wireless signal there are two ways to use a wireless print server. infrastructure mode connects the wireless print server to the wireless router via wireless signal. ad-hoc mode connects the wireless print server directly to the wireless network adapter of a computer (also via wireless signal). you can set it up either way. infrastructure mode is represented in the above diagrams. if you want more information on that linksys wireless print server, just click on ''user guide'' in the link i provided earlier.
2067	9	166901	1852822	1852813	linkit	4/3/06 12:57 pm	1.14406902e12	yes (correction)	the cable between the print servers and the printers is a usb or parallel cable and not a network cable as indicated in the key.
