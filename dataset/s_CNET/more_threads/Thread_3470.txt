12574	5	548695	5237786	5237792	r. proffitt	11/28/11 2:20 pm	1.32249e12	it's the heat management or air flow	the major failures i see could be avoided with good psus and good air flow. a nice size case is good but unless the air is flowing, all that is for naught. many gamers have taken to leaving the side cover off which i've done many times while i decide how i'm going to punch a big hole in the cover to get more flow. bob

12574	8	548695	5237803	5237800	jca119	11/28/11 2:32 pm	1.32249072e12	alright i guess i'll go with the majority	so basically as long as i have good air flow now, i can handle a gtx560/570 etc.?
12574	9	548695	5237811	5237803	r. proffitt	11/28/11 2:36 pm	1.32249096e12	should be fine.	more than fine for gamers. i wonder if you worried about cpu horsepower. so far, for most games it's all about the gpu. bob
12574	10	548695	5237812	5237811	jca119	11/28/11 2:43 pm	1.32249138e12	sounds good!	so a lot more about the gpu, so my cpu is okay? when is cpu important?
12574	11	548695	5237806	5237812	r. proffitt	11/28/11 2:47 pm	1.32249162e12	when it's single core and under 1ghz?	there are few games that tap the cpu too hard. i hope someone lists them for us but for most, it's all about the gpu and for loading times, the speed of the hdd. bob
12574	12	548695	5237817	5237806	jca119	11/28/11 2:51 pm	1.32249186e12	ah that's good news then.	i see, so that's how it works. thanks for the assistance!
