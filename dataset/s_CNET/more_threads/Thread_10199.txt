6773	2	512802	5060052	5059950	bus	1/6/11 4:59 pm	1.29433314e12	okay will do	the last time i did it on an old machine like this one, the cpu came out with the heat sink(the heat sink compound acted like glue)and some of the pins got bent. i spent 6 hours re-aligning the cpu pins. so i'm a little gun shy on this one. i'll bite the bullet on this one pull the heat sink off clean the old compound off and replace with new and with luck i will get it back together.
