can i use a dual processor in the &quot; build a small but dazzling entertainment pc&quot; here on cnet week-end proect ? thanx,ivan.
make sure your mother board supports it and it's the same socket type.
...you need a micro-atx motherboard. if you want to get a dual core, get an amd because the intels run too hot for a small case. the amd's perform better, use less power, and run a lot cooler.
