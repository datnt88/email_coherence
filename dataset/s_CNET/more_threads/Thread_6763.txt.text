can anyone tell me how c-net gets the throughput results that are posted on the wirless product reviews? i have the product and would like to see if i can replicate the numbers that are posted in the reviews. thanks!
cnet reviewed the netgear wpnt-834 which i have. i get better range and speed than their review. it's possible that with the variables of firmware updates and neighbors with wifi that your mileage will vary. bob
i see, thanks for the insight. i'm curious if they test the performance by chariot or just transferring a file and calculating the amount of time it takes to get the throughput....
read  and see if you like that. bob
