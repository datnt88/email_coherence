hi, when i try to print pictures and sometimes text, i get thick lines appearing vertically through it. i have tried to re-align the print heads but it doesn't help. i didn't have any problems until a few weeks ago and i can't seem to get rid of them. i'm using windows xp. any help would be great. thanks ste
clean all the rollers and paper feed mechanism (basically all the parts which come into contact with the topside of the paper as it feeds through) with some safe solvent like that used to clean cassette players or cd discs. use cotton-buds for the more inaccessible areas. you should also try running several sheets of plain paper through after that with the 'paper out' button. the paper will pick up any stray or excess ink from places you can't reach. repeat with fresh sheets util you start geting unmarked pages.
thanks for the info. ive cleaned the rollers with ethanol but it hasn't helped. i don't think it is excess ink as the lines are consistant throughout. i have taken a photo of a printout which shows the lines, could i email this to you or somebody else in hope that you can see what the problem is ? thanks ste
