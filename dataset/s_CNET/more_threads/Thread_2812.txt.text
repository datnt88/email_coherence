my rig has very specific power requirements and this is the only one i can find with the power and user reviews being positive. tom's hardware guide doesn't list it in any reviews, though. i've vaguely heard of this brand and it seemed to be positive. the brand that thg recommends , antec, doesn't put out enough +12v current. i think the highest for antec was 19 amps at the +12v. i'm needing at least 25 amps at the +12v. there are quite a few other brands that say their ps's put out the required current but thg says many brands fib. which brings me back to the subject header.... thanks for any help
i don't own one myself, but it has been highly recommended by many in these forums. given your requirements, i would contact the seller for additional assurance and/or guarantee of it's performance.
if you know what you need and can't find it, then certainly pcp&c is close to whatever you need. you may even want to talk to them for special needs provided you have the wallet for it. in other words, you truly get what you pay for. you may want to check this website:  i wish my end-uers had pcp&c just to step away from persistant atx power issues. yeah, they're expensive but the end result is far better that what's usually offered out there. good luck -----willy
