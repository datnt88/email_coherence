i have a pc built by a friend... i notice that once in a while the pc would just turn on by itself.. there is no pattern but most of the time early in the morning....
bios settings? example: &quot;rtc alarm power on&quot; and others at  bob
do you also have anything set for wake on ??? wake on lan wake on modem ? or does a cat jump on a keyboard and trigger the machine to boot ?
