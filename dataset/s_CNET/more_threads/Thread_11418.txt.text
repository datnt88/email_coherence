hi, having done as much research as seems possible on the internet, i'd appreciate some input to help choose between these color laser printers: - xerox phaser 6500dn - konica minolta magicolor 3730dn - hp color laserjet cp3525dn - epson aculaser c3900dn - lexmark c734dn anybody with experience of using any of them? please post positive / negative views, especially re reliability issues and hidden / unexpected costs. some background info currently a soho user, expanding in one years time to small business of 3+ people who will share the printer. main use is printing duplexed a4 high quality flyers as well as teaching materials; these include (some colored) text, graphs and photographic content. other (smaller) sizes and heavier weights of paper are occasionally printed. i already have an oki b6200 laser printer with duplexer for plain b/w printing. main criteria + budget of &#8364;350-&#8364;700 + text, graphic and photo printing must be as close to excellent as possible (for a laser) - slower print speeds are acceptable if not extreme - higher printing costs acceptable within reason thnx in advance for any comments on these printers, or even for other printers that you think might fit the bill.
all the color lasers are nice but your spec makes me think you are not going to be happy with laser color printing. there's only one way to settle that. get some output in your hands. bob
yes, samples of course will help with print quality issues, but what i'm really after is insight into reliability issues or hidden running costs which samples won't show me.
life span is about 2 years till you may need repairs or an expensive part. i know of no hidden running costs. all the printers i looked at years ago gave expected pages for the drum, fuser and such. however the real costs soar when folk do full page color prints. most of the page counts are for 5% coverage. you can do the math if you move to 100% coverage. bob
