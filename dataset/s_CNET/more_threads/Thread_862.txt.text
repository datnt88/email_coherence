hi all i have narrowed my choice down to the samsung galaxy 7.7 with full phone spec or motorola xoom 2 media edition some help please ?really not sure on the best one thanks arron
i'm encountering too many folk that are trying to replace their laptops with android things. both are nice but so far, i still need a laptop. bob
time. i wanted android and the acer and motorola were cheaper but the screens didn't compare to the samsung. i got the galaxy tab 10.1 and i love it. they are coming out with the galaxy tab note in the near future.
