(i'm a photographer, i store mainly digital pictures and video files on it, that are rather large in filesize. that is why i do not wish to encrypt them, beacause it takes ages...) but i need to access them quickly, without any major time issue. i wouldn't mind a 'digital key' solution, usually you get 2 keys and i'm not afraid of loss. something you would use like a pass through key with some password, that does not encrypt the whole file but just blocks its access. thanks, sidney
