does anyone know how to use it? i clicked on it, and it says &quot;epriviledge&quot;. and does anyone else know another software like this one whihc cools down the cpu? thanx
rarely needed with the modern os's since these implement the halt instruction into the bottom loop of the os. xp, linux and others already have this and its my opinion the less software you install the more stable the machine is. bob
thanx for the reply, i'll take your advice of stop looking for those kind of softwares
