hey, does anybody know why my new epower psu is making a wierd clicking noise? heres the link.
visiting the website you offered, a poster there made the point, it has loud operating fan, maybe too noisy. if that's the case, the cause is the fan. it can be unbalanced or simply too cheap of a fan installed. however, smaller fans will be loud if they operate in high rpms. better quality fans even if high rpms are quieter and made from metal generally are noiseless if one can even find one nowadays. -or- the clicking noise is a poor component starting to breakdown but hasn't failed yet or even a dusty fan. tada -----willy
yeah, the clicking noise sounds very electrical. what do you think i should do? it's brand new. and it started doing the clicking noise about 5 minutes after i started the computer up.
take a can of air or air hose and with no ac power applied, simply whirl the fan with the air. if it makes the noise, then you have a bad fan. if you recently got this new, then see what the warranty issues are, return it. , etc.. however, if the that poster is correct then i suspect that brand psu model may have noisy fans and even the replacement one is going to be noisy. so consider yet another in its place, providing you get credit, etc and buy a better psu or just another brand of similar rating. tada -----willy
ok, thanx
