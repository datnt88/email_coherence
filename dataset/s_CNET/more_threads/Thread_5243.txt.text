save your money for something like a bigger faster hard disk. that will cost less and payback. bob
i have a wdc wd2500jd-75hbco (233 gb)hard drive in there now. it says that there is 229 gb (182gb-80% free space)ntfs i don't think that more hard disk space is nessasary with all that free space. running xp home he has these games on. desert combat battle field 2 call of duty 2 postal 2 delta force black hawlk down i have a nvidia ge force 6800. the system gets slow some times when he is doing online gaming etc. i thought that the extra memory to juggle with might help. i don't really know anything about computers so maybe i'm wrong.
for the games listed, you might see some improvement with more ram but tweaking may help more. for example, battlefield 2 can consume &gt;1gb on its own but you can reduce ram usage and stuttering by setting texture quality to medium.    also make sure you defrag your hd and use a fixed page file (1.1x your fixed ram) since content fetches are typically the cause of stuttering. 2gb will be the power-user setting when vista debuts early next year, so if you plan to keep the pc for 18+ months, a ram upgrade may be more worthwile. but if you plan to get a new pc in 2007, tweak what you've got.
while a nice video card there are much faster now. it's only my opinion that 1gb is plenty for today. about your hard disk. 500gb maxline pro 500 sata 3.0gb internal hard drive internal hard drive with 500gb capacity, 7200rpm spindle speed, 16mb cache buffer, 8.5ms average seek time. beats the one you have on seek time and if your board supports it has twice the transfer rate in bursts. bob
