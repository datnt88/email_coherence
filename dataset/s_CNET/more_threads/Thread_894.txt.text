sons play lego star wars 1 on my pc. recently updated ati driver to 7.4. lego star wras runs for 30 minutes then stops with message teklling me that i need a graphics card compatible with pixel shader 1.1. i cannot find anything about pixel shading in the ati help nor spot anything on the ati control center. i thought my graphics card was reasonably up-to-date. am i missing something? details intel pentium 4 3.06ghz- xp pro sp2 (media center 2004). 512 mbram - 256 mb graphics card memory. thanks in advance
try it with the cover off and a fan pointed at the open case. bob
