8394	2	571107	5351346	5351350	dyans88	8/24/12 2:44 pm	1.34581944e12	tried that as well	thanks for the reply bob. yeah i tried that as well i unplugged everything from my pc and reset it, i've actually reset it a few times. when i plug in my optical mouse for example the red light on the bottom of the mouse will blink very quickly and turn back off. however, if i plug it into the usb port about half way the light fully turns on and then flashes on and off every three seconds or so. it just seems to strange that every usb port was working perfectly fine and all of a sudden all 12 aren't working.

8394	4	571107	5351396	5351357	dyans88	8/24/12 5:05 pm	1.3458279e12	specifics.	yeah i've done that as well, opened the case dusted it gently with pressurized air can etc the machine itself is running windows 7 on an i7 core 16gigs ram it has a 550 psu. anything else that i could provide you with? at the moment i have it turned on with just the keyboard and mouse plugged in. i've also hear that it could be that the computer isnt recognizing the usb devices plugged in and so it's not feeding them power is that correct?

8394	6	571107	5351471	5351447	dyans88	8/24/12 6:47 pm	1.34583402e12	not yet.	let me look up the details and i'll get back to you on that one. i was thinking the same thing in regards to the power unit, i'll probably be replacing it sooner than later as i do use it for gaming. i also unplugged the front facing usb ports from within the pc itself and that didn't work either. i was also thinking of simply replacing the front facing ports those do connect via a pci bus as opposed to the back ones which are connected directly to the mb correct?
8394	7	571107	5351605	5351334	steven haninger	8/25/12 5:52 am	1.34587392e12	after reading the posts here, i wonder if you looked at	device manager to see if there's any evidence of usb port issues there. i've had usb port failures related to the southbridge component. what i was able to note physically was that it got uncomfortably hot to the touch. that shouldn't happen. it did seem to occur while either inserting or withdrawing a usb device. i decided to blame it on esd for lack of a better reason. i was able to buy an add in card to gain usb function but the mb failed entirely within the next couple of months. check device manager for usb problems.

8394	11	571107	5351766	5351750	dyans88	8/25/12 12:52 pm	1.34589912e12	fried	the single ps2 port which it has is also fried. i ended up replacing the front facing usb ports and they're now working, however now the dvi connectors aren't working which leads me to either the graphics card or the mb. i'm trying to find a mother board online so i could replace it however i'm unable to find the exact one my pc has. it's equipped with an msi ms 7673 mb. i'm also trying to find another compatible mb in any case however i'm not having any luck on that front either.

8394	18	571107	5351803	5351794	dyans88	8/25/12 1:36 pm	1.34590176e12	pc	this is actually the exact pc i have.

8394	21	571107	5352378	5352348	r. proffitt	8/27/12 9:31 am	1.34605986e12	that's possible when	i've seen that when the sata ports are set to raid in the bios. it's a custom install where we feed drivers and maybe more. i strongly suggest folk not do this if they are not deeply familiar with pcs and windows. bob
8394	22	571107	5352803	5352348	steven haninger	8/28/12 5:05 am	1.3461303e12	two choices depending on your os	win7 should work but i'll presume you have xp and it doesn't recognize sata drives with bios set to &quot;enhanced&quot; or &quot;achi&quot; modes. you either set the bios to ide mode (which might be called pata or &quot;legacy&quot;) or you have the motherboard's 3rd party driver handy while pressing f6 when asked during the installation. xp installs only accept floppy disks for these drivers. you'd have to rely on your motherboard driver package to have this disk or for the cd rom to have the &quot;makedisk&quot; utility which can create a floppy for the enhanced mode drivers.
