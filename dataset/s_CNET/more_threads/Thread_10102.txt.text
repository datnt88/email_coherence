my cd/dvd player in my computer just randomly quit playing. i went though and tried to uninstall it and reinstall it, but it still comes up with an error code 10. is there some way of making the thing work? would be nice to have it.... thanks for any help. it is a psa h20l ata
it's a gsa, not psa
swap the cd cables or get a new one and check results. just what do you mean by not playing? if you have too much going on it may blog down the ide ch. and/or slow it so much it appears as an error. thus check to disable any bkgrd. running pgms. to release system resources back again. when it comes to cd/dvd type errors is to simply replace it and start from there. the wear&tear of the drive has gotten to a point of failure though not 100% yet. tada -----willy
