i just bought the xbox 360, i wanted to get xbox live throught a usb linksys wireless-g adapter. is it possible to hook it up with the xbox to recieve the wireless signal that has been set up in my house???
this is totally possible... i used my old hawkings wireless g usb reciever to plug into my 360 and voila, i could choose to use my network on the reciever. just go to the network dashboard menu after you plugged it in and you should see the reciever, just highlight it and select use.
you might want to plug the reciever on the back of the 360, because in the front the ring of light and the dvd-drive might interfere with the signals, so you want the best signal strength possible...
i connected it to the 360, but when i go to test connection, it seems to not be able to detect the hardware, despite the adapter getting power from the 360.
