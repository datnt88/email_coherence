what exactly is gddr2 listed on the new graphics cards? and if my motherboard only supports ddr as the ram slot, will it not run any of the gddr2 cards even through avg slots?
*agp not agv
mfg and model number do you have ? type ram on video card and type of ram on mb need not match. vapcmd
my computer is a dell dimension 4600. ive upgraded everything in it besides the motherboard. i was looking into visiontek radeaon hd2600pro
i still need help on this subject
the ram on the video card could be the latest stnaa technology and since it's on the video card it won't matter to your pc. it will be &quot;a video card.&quot; bob
you could also see what they say on tomshardware.com regarding the best bang for the buck on the current generation of agp video cards. vapcmd
