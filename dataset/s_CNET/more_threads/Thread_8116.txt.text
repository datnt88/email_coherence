ok im building a gaming pc with an i5-3750k cpu... i want to mainly play diablo 3 and starcraft 2 on ultra settings, witch i believe nvdia favors --- also looking into games such as crysis 3, b3, and metro witch i heard the 7950 favors because of memory/bandwidth yadda yadda yadda.. so im asking you people for help !! also. physx looks sick just saying... and more games are starting to offer it -- please comment. *facts* gtx 660ti ***vs*** radeon hd 7950
meaning they swap places on what they each do better. if it was my call and i was going to spend 300 bucks.....i'd go with the 7950. way better bandwidth.
im using one monitor if that makes a difference? what role does bandwidth play over the 660ti? there is no price difference right now
i'd head to google and type in tomshardware and then add the card in question then the word review. i know they did the 7750 and recall they did the 660 so you can compare the two and pick the one that did better on the game in question. bob
that refers to how fast you can feed the card. for game play across multiple games this is important. for game play on a specific game perhaps not so much. search for reviews........i think your going to find that overall the 7950 is the better card.
