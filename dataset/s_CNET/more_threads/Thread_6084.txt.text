hi, i just bought a nvidia 64mb pci video card for my custom made computer, before it had a agp ati rage maxx fury video card that wouldn't work with windows xp, so i bought the nvidia so i could upgrade to windows xp. the problem is that i installed it, and when i went to turn on the computer, nothing shows up on the screen. what can i do to fix this problem?
1. dead card. 2. not seated proper. bob
well i've had this problem for a while where my pci slots have to be turned on with bios, but i really don't want to mess it up that much
