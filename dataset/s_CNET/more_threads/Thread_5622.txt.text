my hp1170c has been a great printer, but it is no longer working---simply worn out. at any rate, i will be discarding it and would like to know if it has a permanent memory storage that should be removed for security reasons before discarding. thanks in advance for any information that you can provide! lee
there is buffer memory just used as temporary storage while printing. it's reset when power goes off.
i suspected that might be the case, but wanted to make sure. appreciate your response. lee
