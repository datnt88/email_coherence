can anybody please tell me which company puts better components in their systems? i'm seeking a quad core with 3gb ram and tv on the video card. thanks!
the cpus are made by about 2 makers. same there. there are a limited number of drive makers. same. the boards are made from same copper and such. which leads us to possible choices in airflow and power supply ratings. which are areas not looked at by most unless there is an issue. bob
they use more 'high-end' components (bigger power supplies, faster ram, etc.) on the pcs they offer direct. retail gateways and hps are a tossup.
