i'm building a pc pretty soon. i want to overclock my cpu not a lot. maybe 200 or 300 mhz. i'm going to get an amd 3500+ on socket am2. my question is will any after market fan/heatsink work with any processor? in particular, will  this cooler work on  this motherboard with an am2 3500+?
what i would do is goto the manufacturers websites, i have no idea what am2 socket is lol. i dont think gigabyte make that heatsink any more. goto this link  . if you want something to cool your cpu down. try asaka aswell. but goto the manufacturers site first! and also do some more research on am2!
a good place to start would be with amd......
most cpu/hsf setups are rated for thier highest level of usage. so, if you get a fan for xyz-1000cpu and it becomes overclocked to xyz-1300cpu then you're really going beyond the rating of the fan. though a fan can take excessive heat, don't expect all fans to do so and whatever &quot;quality&quot; means alot. thus, some namebrnads fans are capable of handling oc'ing but look for any rating label to match what you plan to oc to as a safe bet of sustained usage. remember you still have to &quot;exhaust&quot; the immediate heat build-up as well to best serve any hsf to maintain its sustained rating or over time will fail. tada -----willy
