i a buying a new pc. planning to do a lot of gaming on it. is a creative audio x-fi pci card worth $79? thank you for your help. though i will not be at my pc for a while and may not respond.
while i didn't hear much difference in the headphones the recording was stellar compared to almost every onboard sound system i've tried. bob
and in fact i use the x-fi fidelity with creative speakers. very satisfied. comes with some fairly good software as well.
x-fi has lower cpu usage (which means higher framerates in games) and it sounds much better than built-in sound. creative's eax implementation is way better than most built-in stuff so you'll hear sounds clearer, with better directional placing, and great environmental effects.
good sound card + cheap speakers = wasted time and effort.
would it be worth having a 2.1 audio system with it? if so what would be best for the money?
