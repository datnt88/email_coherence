the connection alows me to use computer and phone at same time but from time to time if someone calls it will disconnect and kick me off why is that
a portable phone? you may have to change channels on the portable phone and/or the wireless network, then are using the same bandwith. rick
but it will only disconnect me if i am playing diablo on battle.net and someone calls then after they are off the phone it will come back
