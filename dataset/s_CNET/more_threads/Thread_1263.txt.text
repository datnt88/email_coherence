i am using a lg-4082b, and am burning some videos to dvd with nero express 3. i have been experiencing problems, and i am not sure what it is. i have copied some dvd's of mine with no problems, and burned some data discs with no problems. it seems that the problem only occurs when making dvd movie's. nero works fine until the very end. it burns about 4.4gb out of the 4.6 and then has an error and stops. i saved the nero logs from two seperate burns and they are different, although they have the same characteristics: burns about 4.4gb then stops and a error message comes up. in one of the logs, it says: [17:12:16] nerovision ???? 05:12:08
i have read something about nero having problems with the ac3 audio format, how do i find out if my file is using that format? and if it is, how to i recode it?
i am sure ac3 audio format is not the problem now. turns out the audio was in mp3 format. i tried to burn the same thing on my benq 1620, worked perfectly. so i dunno what the problem could be...
i only use these medias. ritek taiyo yuden pro disc verbatim i dont want my burner going south because of cheap media. easy guide,
reports are too numerous about this issue. i can almost assure you that the issue is not you. my only fix? use something else. bob
i use prodisc, so i don't think its the media... anyways, i'm just gonna stick with my benq for burning movies now.
