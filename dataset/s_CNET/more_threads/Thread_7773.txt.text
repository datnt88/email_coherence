i'm considering purchasing a hp 5590 scanner. i have a load of old notes that i don't want to part with and wanted to digitize (at last 5,000 pages) it has an adf (auto doc feeder) and apparently software that will allow scanning of lots of pages. last time i attempted this the scanner i purchased sporadically loaded pages in adobe but since it was the read version (not full) more often it gave me error messages. is the 5590 a good product for the job i'm planning? i use a xp os. thanks pete
ask for the store's return policy (in writing) before you buy so you know before you find it didn't work out. only one comment. copier machines that handle paper well are many thousands of dollars. you won't find excellant paper handling in the price item you are looking at. bob
thanks! pete
