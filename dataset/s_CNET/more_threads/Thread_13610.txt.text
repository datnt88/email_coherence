hi. i have a wgr614 v8 netgear wireless router. it is not connected directly to my computer. i need to open ports 3658, 3659, 6500, and 27900 so that i can connect to other servers while playing star wars battlefront ii for pc. does anyone know how to open these ports? if so, please reply. i have been trying for over a week. thanks nick

what kind of gaming device are you using?
