just the other day i had to restart my computer after a crash while watching a movie. i had to use the power button, since ctrl-alt-del didn't work. when the computer booted up again, strange noises came from the harddrive, almost sounded like some sort of sci-fi raygun. i've never encountered that one before, so i was wondering if anyone had any advise for me on what to do? send it for repairs, hum along with the noise, or ignore it? or something? -icaros-
as long as there are no files you can't lose, then i'd ignore it, then replace the drive when it fails. bob
the real question is, where is the problem. i constantly hear people referring to their computer as their &quot;hard drive&quot; when the hard drive is just one small thing inside a computer. is the problem actually coming from the hard drive, did you open up the case and see if the noise still happens if you unplug the power from the hard drive. usually you hear a noise from a fan in a system, not the drive, when a hard drive starts making a lot of noise it is almost always already toast, due to a head crash, and damage to the platters. when is the last time you backed up your system's data?
any noice noticable coming from the hd isn't good but there's the outside chance it was trying to access a pgm/file that maybe corrupted or fragmented and doing alot more work to do so. regardless, do a backup asap just to be safe. goto the hd makers support website and get thier diags as that is the required process in order to proceed with any &quot;warranty&quot; returns provided you're still covered. even so, the diags themselves will readily check the hd. if a problems exists, use warranty or open wallet. if the problem seems to be a pgm/file(s), reload them but a good hd defrag seems to be in order anyways, just get that backup done as well. -----willy
