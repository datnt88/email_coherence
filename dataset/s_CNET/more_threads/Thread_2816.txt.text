i currently have a 750gb pata drive (only about 20-25gb actually used, the rest is free) that i want to clone onto a 300gb velociraptor drive recently purchased for increased performance of my system. i am going to use arconis true image to clone the disk and i was wondering if anyone had any issues cloning a partition from a larger disk to a smaller disk? would any data be potentially lost even though the pata drive is only about 20-25gb full right now?
they should ...the data would still be on the pata. and if you miss some, you could always reconnect the pata and recopy the missing part. vapcmd
i've used acronis to go from multi-partitioned larger drives to smaller drives without a problem. you shouldn't have too any trouble. my best advise would be to just take your time and double check your setting before you execute the job. bwg ms-it
