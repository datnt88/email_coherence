i have a laptop that i would like to connect to my di-524... it gets connection and it says excellent, but its not recieving or sending any packets. ive noticed that under address type, it says manually configured, and i dont think its supposed to say that. from what i know, it should say assigned by dhcp. can someone help me fix this problem? thx also, i have 2 other computers connected to it, so i dont think anythings wrong with the router.
is your firmware the latest? did you try it with wep/wpa turned off? bob
i think i know what youre talking about. you need to wait till the next day or just wait a week and if it hasnt connected go to a computer place and ask a technology worker about it and do what they say.
