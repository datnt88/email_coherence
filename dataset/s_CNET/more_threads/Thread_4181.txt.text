i getting a used 2800+ 333 of ebay. i know its not the latest. but it is 333mhz. my board will take it. but i'm still using 266 ram. i forget do i have to get 333 ram? or can i use the 2 512mb 2100 266 ram i have? it'll be a little bit slower. but will it still work or do i have to get 333 ram? or i can under clock. the bios allows me to set the cpu at 100, 133, or 166. don't know if under clocking is safe. i know overclocking is not but under clocking? ivnj
good luck with this.
that still doesn't answer the question. is underclcokinmg safe or not? or is there any harm in using 266 ram on 333 cpu?
b. by setting your fsb to 133 it should allow you to recycle your ram. and as always your cpu must be on the motherboard's cpu support list. bob
it is supported. xp 2800+ 333 is supported and even 3000+ 333 is. and if i set the board to 5:1 i can use 133 ran and 333 cpu. or i can set both cpu and ram to 133. i just don't want to buy new ram since i already have 1gb. so i guess i'll just try it and see how it goes. now i just need a new fan capable of supporting a 2800+ socket a. ivnj
