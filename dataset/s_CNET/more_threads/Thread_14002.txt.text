i am planning to but a external hdd, i read the specification it say formatted to &quot;fat32&quot;. i did a further research and came to know it cannot store files more than 4gb unless i convert the drive into ntfs. i have couple of movies in hd (~5gb each). i will be using the drive mostly with windows xp and vista systems, and occasionally with mac 1. is converting to ntfs a good idea? 2. is ntfs better then fat32? if yes, then why the manufacturer is not selling the drive in ntfs? 3. any issues with ntfs format?
it's because it is more universal (almost any os can read them). 1. that depends on the device that you will use it on. if all can read and write to ntfs then it's a very good idea. 2. i think you can say that. 3. none that i can think of.
i am planning to reformat my hdd to ntfs.... didnt find any issues with ntfs... (still did not understood.. why manufacturer does not gives it in ntfs)
you may be able to use the &quot;convert&quot; command and not need to reformat the drive. if you have data on the drive, it should be safe but you do want to back it up anyway. i know xp and win 7 can do this. i don't know about vista but presume it can do so also.
