(i could probably spend up to $2,000 without the dw getting too wild!) what should i make sure i have in my laptop to be able to connect with the internet wherever i am? my cellphone contract is almost due, and i've read some articles about getting a digital cellphone and using that as an access to the internet. good idea or not? any company have better plans and service than others? what do i need to know so i don't get talked into buying unnecessary plans, equipment, etc? we will be staying in hotels sometimes, the rv other times. what would i want to have in my laptop so i could access any free internet available. i've read some stuff about wifi hotspots and hotels having rj45 jacks, etc, but i guess i'm at the point now where i've read so much that i am just overwhelmed with information. any ideas what would you do in my situation? i am also going to be using the laptop at home (wisconsin/arizona), so i'd like to know a simple(if possible) way to be able to somehow use my home internet service with both my home pc and my laptop. i have charter cable internet service at home. windows xp home edition. also, i'm experienced with xp and i really like it. should i get a laptop with xp, or vista? i know it's a lot ground to cover, but like i said, i'm a newbie at the whole laptop traveling thing, so i'd really appreciate any help. is there a website that explains all this? maybe a faq? thanks a lot in advance, eddie
