i have a hp pavilion ze4900 and i do alot of university work on my laptop. but after about 10 mins i get an icon sign thats says your virtual memory is low, what does this mean and how do i correct it thanx???????????
go to my computer &gt; properties &gt; advanced &gt; [performance] settings &gt; advanced &gt; virtual memory and tell us what it says. also tell your total and free disc space from the properties of the drive the virtual memory is defined on (probably the c:-drive). this will give a clear picture of the situation, so we can tell you what to do. kees
hi kees thanx for replying it says type: local drive:file system: nfts:used space 22.1gb: free space: 15.0gb capacity: 37.2 gb total paging file for all drives is 513mb does this help you.
