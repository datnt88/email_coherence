even after putting on the standoffs in the case, the video card does not seat perfectly but it does work. would the video card get damaged if it is not seated perfectly?
one time i found fried fingers on the pcb card edge. you really need to fix it.
there is like about 1/16 of an inch left before it is fully seated.
is the motherboard too low in the case? if so some fiber washers on top of the mounting studs can help.
where do you buy fiber washers? and what kind?
over the years i have some in my kit from prior machines. i used this as an example of how to use what common part i see in most cases or motherboard mounting kits. any shop that sells pc parts (not best bu, gold max or such will have such) should have them.
after discharging any static electricity (see note below) and unplugging the pc get a straightedge and see if somethings bent. you my need to replace the motherboard or video card. listen for arching electricity. a sure sign the gap is too wide. look for a black sooty residue on the agp/pci/pcie slot, this means it's been arching. arching is bad news. what temperatures is this card running at? over 70c and you have a problem. approaching 70c might be a problem for some boards, over 66c or more. check with the manufacturer of the card for the upper temperature limits for this card. high operating temperatures might be a sign of poor connectivity between the card and the board.  the note &gt;&gt;&gt; removing static discharge:  care should be exercised whenever dealing with electricity. you have not given us your age. if under 18 years old your parents must assist you. this thread untracked. now, back to bob.
