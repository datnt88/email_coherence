5627	5	28913	329627	328963	citizen kabuto	7/12/04 12:23 pm	1.08963498e12	re: so it's not web printing.	in the original post i specified that it was the compaq ij1200 printer running on win2000 pro. i also said that the printer worked fine (with the same drivers) when winme was installed on the same computer a little while back. i reinstalled the driver, everything is set to default, paper size and margins are also ok. the weird thing is that the test page prints fine. if something was wrong in the settings, wouldn't the test page be printed incorrectly as well? maybe i've missed something. i just thought that maybe if someone here came across this problem in the past, they'd have an answer. i don't know what else to tell you. chris

5627	7	28913	329647	329627	r. proffitt	7/12/04 12:37 pm	1.08963582e12	try other applications.	such as notepad. double check the margins in the application since they can be amiss. yes, sometimes i miss the items in the post. bob

5627	13	28913	334226	334216	r. proffitt	7/15/04 2:18 pm	1.08990108e12	not me that does that!	the forum software limits the depth of the replies. always have. now that you have revealed in good detail how you are printing, instead open the jpeg and print from an application. i see we are inching towards the fix, but do keep trying. bob
5627	14	28913	334271	328116	r. proffitt	7/15/04 2:56 pm	1.08990336e12	a note about this from google groups.	this discussion notes one cure. read reply #3. microsoft doesn't tell us why this may work. bob
