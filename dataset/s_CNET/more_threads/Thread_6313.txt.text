ok - i would think this may be something that is solely about what a user wants.....but my question is this. currently i have a cdrw burner and a dvd burner installed on my desktop, is this set up better than saying having just a dvdcdr combo burner? in other words, which is best, one burner or two?
i put in a pair of dvdrw drives. the only reason for cdrw is if it's leftovers or &quot;free.&quot; bob
two drives come in handy. i also like to have 2 drives so i can leave my current favorite game cd/dvd loaded and always ready to play. cheap dvd burners aren't really that much more expensive than their read-only counterparts.
i have two dvd-rw's and a cd-rw which covers most eventualities. and i get to burn 2 disks at a time. but i'd definitely go for two seperate ones it makes burning a lot faster in some modes and if one gives up you still have the second till you get a replacement.
definately two dvd burners i use 2 and have done for a long time it is just easier to manage your burning jobs,i use pioneer because i was told that they were the best by a technician at my local computer shop this is just a personnel choice now,i also like that getting updated drivers is easy from the pioneer site.
i have an internal dvd-rw burner plus an external same. it's always good practice to have a backup.
