i want to buy a printer that can print with great quality because i want to use it to make shirts using the paper which you iron to any cotton shirt,what printer should i buy? any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.. i need something thats heavy duty cause i want to make it as a small business. i want to print and make shirts and sell it to my friends..
you'll have to hit the printer maker websites for &quot;heavy duty&quot; models. but why not treat the printer as a disposable? even the 100 buck printer will give good service for a year and if you can't factor that into the biz.... bob
that was indeed a good suggestion sir, but im not really that knowledgeable bout printers, im guessing that i should buy an ink jet type of printer and not a laser type.. am i right? what printers are good for printing on iron-on papers sir?
in short, if it's the cheapest in the store, don't buy it. bob
