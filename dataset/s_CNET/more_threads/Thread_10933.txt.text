can dual channel memory be used in a mobo that doesnt have dual channel capability? mobo is a gigabyte k8ns pro
but technically speaking ... it's not dual channel memory...it's plain old ddr ram used in a dual channel architecture to enhance memory performance. vapcmd
but it just won't have dual channel. it will be regular ram. ~ibrahim~
