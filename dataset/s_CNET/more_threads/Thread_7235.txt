10338	4	519055	5099431	5098799	doodah	3/14/11 9:11 am	1.30009386e12	roll out ... when	waiting &quot;until the roll out&quot; seems to be a never ending story. i'm a multiply disabled guy who is homebound. fortunately for me, my town has blanket-wifi ... i don' need no frakking 3/4g. :-p. i don't want an ipad that costs more and has no usb, sd slot or adobe flash, a kindle dx costs so much yet does so little & just 1 to 2 hundred more, sometimes less, gets me allot mores features. i do my due-diligence and google my froogle in research, but for a 10&quot; android 3.0 the date of release gets further and further away, &quot;december 2010, ok maybe january 2011, just kidding, it's february. we lied it's march ... april fool's!&quot; i'm getting tired of it. sure there is the mortola xoom, but the price is really high. i'm looking at the notion ink, asus ep101tc, maybe the cheaper wifi only xoom that's supposedly coming, but i'm growing impatient

10338	6	519055	5099496	5099437	doodah	3/14/11 10:06 am	1.30009716e12	why i wait	it took me a year to save my $600, the xoom, at it's price now, is way to high. i could buy a laptop for less. even if i put the rest on my 25% apr card, it'd still take a huge bite out of my mothly budget. the only good part of waiting so long is my tablet saving build.

10338	10	519055	5099755	5099509	doodah	3/14/11 4:36 pm	1.30012056e12	it's coming	i just saw the xoom wifi-only is supposedly going to be released on the 22 or 27th (i've seen both). i'll pre order as soon as it's official.
