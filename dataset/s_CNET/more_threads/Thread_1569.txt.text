hi i have a pc with the following spec: windows vista home premium 32-bit intel g33m motherboard 500-watts ps intel core 2 duo e6550 @ 2.33ghz 2 x 1gb patriot pc-6400 ram @ 800mhz geforce 8800gt oc wd 500gb hard i know that he maximum supported ram is 8gb on my pc, i currently have 2 gb in dual channel and i notice vista is a bit slow on startup. will i see a performance increase if i upgrade to 3gb? what if i upgrade my ram to 8gb by adding 2 more 2gb ram sticks? will having unused ram decrease my pc performance? thanks
upgrading to 3gb i'm told (i use xp) should be plenty for vista. anything after that would not be recognized by your computer once fully booted up, but it can still be used; you'll see it if you go into your bios. extra ram will never decrease your performance.
although your pc can handle 8gb, vista 32bit will only be able to address 4gb and only 3gb or so will be useable. slow startup is usually caused by crapware or uneeded apps. run windows defender and use its &quot;software explorer&quot; feature to see what's running currently and what runs automatically at startup. get rid of software you don't use and don't allow products like quicktime and acrobat to put their 'helpers' in the startup group. read this posting for more info:
startup performance. vapcmd
that's not the problem. 2g is more than enough memory for a bootup. if the bootup is slow, look for some other cause like running processes. turn off quiktime, real player, printer programs that load on startup, etc.
