hey, i'm new to these forums and don't exactly know if this is the right place for this question. i'm at college and was lucky enough to get a room this year that has wireless internet connection (it's close to the common room). but next year i won't be so lucky. so, in an attempt to get some sort of wireless in my dorm room next year i've been researching ad hoc networks (personal routers aren't allowed). i can't find anything that would make an ad hoc network not allowed, but the problem would be that either my roommate or myself would have to keep our laptop plugged in to the internet cable get the network in our room. my question is: is there a way i could construct my own type of router? i was thinking of a very stripped down computer with networking capability to relay the internet to my roommate and my computer. i have never built a computer before, but would enjoy the challenge, but i would like to know if it is even possible before i go out and buy parts or whatever. also, if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.
it's this simple. that would be a personal router by any other name.
but i could envision wireless nic that had the ability to act as an ap. it could be bridged to a wired nic in the same pc was plugged into wall jack. i've done that in my own home to create a wireless network until buying a real ap. it worked but didn't work all that well. but, i get to manage the router and you don't get to do that at your college. i wouldn't do anything that circumvents policy and the reason for it. they can cut you off altogether in the blink of an eye.
