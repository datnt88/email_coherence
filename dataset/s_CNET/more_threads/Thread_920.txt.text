i have a us robotics broadband router (model 8003) networking two computers at home for cable broadband. last night i was on the net, viewed some movie trailers and closed the browser. i tried getting back on a few mitues later and there was no connection to the net found on both computers. i tries re-booting the router by pushing the pin-sized reset button, after that the status light is still showed as orange (which means that there is a system failure according to the us robotics manual). anyone have any possible solutions to find out what excatly is wrong? thanks in advance.
if removal of power and that reset fails, it's likely to be dead. reading  is interesting in that it could have a security issue. bring that up when you call in for rma. tip: be nice, but firm on the phone. no threats, growls or such. if in warranty, good. if not, use that security issue to make your point it should be exchanged. tip 2: accept a replacement of another model if it does the same job. observation. officemax had a belkin router for 10 to 15 bucks. i have no use for another one, but the problem is that shipping can run as much as replacement. this makes a mess out of repair options.. bob
thank you very much. if there is some sort of security issue i probably should/will just get another one.
a cable modem blip by attaching the cm directly to a computer. if you get an ip and get online, then reattach the router and get no ip, it's likely a failed router.
