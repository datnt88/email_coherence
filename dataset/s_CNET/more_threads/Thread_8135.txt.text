i am putting together an old computer from parts and have an old isa sb 16 sound card. running under win me it works but in system in the control panel there is an unknown device and under that is an unsupported device. when i delete the unsupported device and reboot the computer finds the sb 16 and unsupported device and installs them. i've tried drivers and deleting the sound card but it always comes back. if i leave the sound card out, it is fine, so i know it is the sb 16. the problem is that when this happens my linksys usb100tx responds during the windows start up screen and shuts off before it gets to my desktop. thus no network log on and i have to re-install the usb100tx causing me to have to reboot and start the cycle again. any suggestions?
two areas may confound old hardware users. 1. the isa irq would have to be set in the bios for the sb 16 in question. the irq is either 5 or 7 depending on the make of the sb16 or its jumpers. the setting in the bios would either be &quot;legacy&quot; or &quot;non-pci/pnp&quot;. 2. the motherboard drivers are not supplied by microsoft so that is great fun to find. 3. the lack of usb stability is likely item #2 or some other usb issue noted at  too bad you didn't reveal what make/model motherboard. 4. let's be absolutely crystal clear on a very important point. if it works, don't fix it. there is no reason to fix a device manager item if your sound card and all is working! bob
motherboard: va-503+ ver. 1.1 usb via 2.0 pci board
irq for sound card: 7
thanks for any help that you can give me! i will check back later. i must take the wife out for valentine's dinner and a movie.
1. you know the irq to set in the pci pnp/legacy in the bios, so do that. 2. links   the second link notes the irq mini-port router. 3. read the 4 hits with this:  have a great valentine's outing.
