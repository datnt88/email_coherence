(2) what kind of video card do i need. i was told agp is way faster/better than pci but i've been looking at one that has a pci-e card which the local 17 yr old salesjock at compusa says is the next generation video card and is better that agp cards. can i get a system my son will be able to use for a couple of years for $1800 (w/o monitor)and if so any suggestions. dell is easy to order from but should i be looking elsewhere? any advice is welcome. its a very complicated process these days!
