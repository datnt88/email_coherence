how to check whether a ide cable faulty or not using multi meter?
here's why. the newer ide cable is a 40 pin on the ends but 80 conductors are used. you can't use a multimeter to do more than check that pin 1 gets to pin 1 and so on. past that is a rather expensive piece of gear to measure signal crosstalk. here the cable is 2 bucks so the test is 2 bucks. bob
thank you,so if a cable not detecting drives we have to throw.that's all. ok
there is a bios issue, port issue if some motherboard complains about not detecting the 80 conductor cable. but you didn't tell or ask about that. bob
the best way to test cables is to use a known good one. think in terms of replacing a light bulb. swap cable(light bulb) if it works, then the cable is at fault. if not, then you can expand the search for the cause. int real world its far cheaper to use a new/tested cable than testing the cable itself. as to finding the cause, at least you know the cable isn't at fault once checked. tada -----willy
while you could test each pin, (set meter to beep when continuity is detected). that is a lot of pins to check. go with the cable swap.
