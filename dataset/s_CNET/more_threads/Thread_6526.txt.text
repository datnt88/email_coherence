how can i tell if my internal hard drive is set up for ntsf or fat filing system? i just bought an external hard drive, and it is recommended that i format the external drive the same as the internal one. but, for the life of me, i can't find where it indicates type of file system.
i notice it mentioned in disk defragmenter.i quite sure it's mentioned else where.
click start, my computer, r-click the c: drive and select properties.
ok, that was too easy. i found it - ntsf. i knew i had seen it somewhere but drew a blank as to where and started looking in hardware profiles, etc., etc. guess i was making it more complicated than it needed to be. thanks again.
