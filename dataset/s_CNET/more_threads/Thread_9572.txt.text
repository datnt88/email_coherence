tried to boot computer and received a nasty message saying: &quot;boot failure system halted&quot;. bios no longer recognizes drive c. can this drive be used as a slave or is it trashed? i would like to get some pictures out of the picture file. i now am using a 15 gig maxtor drive from an older computer. seems to work ok. thanks
connect the failed drive as slave? i'd give it a shot. you might be able to recover your pictures, then format the drive and it be good again.
a lot depends on which os you have and what is wrong with the drive. i have had this happen and i take the drive out and make it a slave in a different pc and run scandisk on it and this has repaired the drive and it will reboot. works on w2k and xp, but there is no guarente. even if you can get it working again i would shop around for a new hd. then reinstall the os on the new hd, and make the old hd a slave. john
