11478	2	58817	698566	698495	toni h	1/19/05 5:02 pm	1.10615412e12	some of my files	are home mpg and avi movies that i want to send to a relative....if i burn them as data, even though they are ntsc, will they be able to convert them to pal if they need to? toni

11478	4	58817	699315	698876	toni h	1/20/05 5:32 am	1.10619912e12	the data files that i have	are all my backups of my home mpg and avi movies....i was wondering if i have ntsc and am copying the data files to another dvd media to send to my relatives overseas and they use pal, will they be able to convert my data files to pal so they can view them in a dvd player there since the two dvd players are from two different regions? toni
