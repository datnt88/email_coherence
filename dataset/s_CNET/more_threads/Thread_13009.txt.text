this is a tough one for me...any advice?
make that 8600gts*
it's a very low-end video card nowadays. and 2 8600gt cards can't match an 8800 card's performance. an 8800gs is the minimum card a gamer should be considering now. and faster dual cores outperform quad cores in most all games:  8800gs/384, $130:  9600gt/512, $149 before $30 rebate:  8800gt/512, $173 before $30 rebate:
especially if the pc is sli capable. 8800gt is the no-brainer choice. if it' a sli capable rig, throw in another one when budgets permit and you have a very respectable machine. as ramarc says, the faster dual-core is a better bet for games right now - and you'll be able to drop in a current-gen quad core for less when the time comes to upgrade.
