i own a philips 107b4 model crt monitor. i'm satisfied with what i've bought, but for the past several weeks the picture gets more and more distorted. the distorsion is in an &quot;eye&quot; shape, which means the corners of the picture &quot;move&quot; toward the mid of the monitor (upwards and downwards respectably). i've found good reviews on this crt model, but here, in macedonia, noone knows why the picture gets distorted. what should i do?
i suspect you have a monitor issue. some things to fuss with. use the degauss feature of the monitor a couple of times...see if anything changes. verify the refresh rate and screen res selected are supported by the monitor. beg/borrow/steal another monitor for a test. take your monitor to another machine for a test.
various monitor controls, such as pincushion and trapezoid??? after the degauss.
i've tried the degaussing already. it didn't work. i've tried adjusting the convergence, trapezoid, paralelogram and so on... several times. my girlfriend has samsung syncmaster 997mb. it too has a ergoflat tech crt. i noticed it has the same distortion. i guess that (distortion) is something any monitor with this tech has. i'll try contacting philips on this issue as well. thank you, dejan
