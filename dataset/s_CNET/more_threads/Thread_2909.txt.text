if you know you have a sata hd, then you need a sata port connection. if you have -none- on mtrbd. then you need to bet a sata type i/f card to mount in mtrbd. slot. since, you also provided nothing in the details of your mtrbd. or pc in specific, i leave it at that. otherwise, check you manual, pc maker, or mtrbd. maker support website if no manual and/or review details of adding a sata hd if so ported. tada -----willy
connector and an sata cable. vapcmd
