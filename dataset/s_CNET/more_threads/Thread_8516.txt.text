i have a usb memory bar usb device flash drive which i got recently. i was able to use it for a few times but after that when i click on properties it has 0 bytes capacity and the file system is raw. i could not format it because it says &quot;write protected&quot; but i know that it is not write protected, since it is not the type with a write-protect notch/switch. i always safe-remove it whenever i use it. please help, thank you.i am using windows xp service pack 2
read  i found it with  bob
well! my flash drive of 2gb stopped writing at under 1gb and i got the usual write protected message and tried a number of things on the internet. in the end i started the pc in safe mode and right clicked the drive to format it. it started but then near the end came up with a cannot complete this action message. having restarted the pc normally i right clicked the drive again and this time it began formatting normally. problem solved i hope!! mike farnham mikefarnham
