15209	4	251668	2510585	2510579	boilerhorn	6/10/07 1:18 pm	1.18148148e12	doing what you said....	event log has this: a duplicate name has been detected on the tcp network. the ip address of the machine that sent the message is in the data. use nbtstat -n in a command window to see which name is in the conflict state. for more information, see help and support center at  . there are no other machines on the net at this time... need to leave for a few hours. i will check back later. thanks for all of your help!
