7939	0	9179	106729	nr	bradzini	1/21/04 4:16 pm	1.07470176e12	fsb speed...	i just recently built my own pc. i bought the dfi 648fx-ale motherboard, and a pentium 4 2.6ghz w\800mhz front side bus speed procesor. the motherboard can support an 800mhz fsb speed, yet when i run pcmark04 it reads my fsb bus speed as 200mhz. i cannot find anywhere in the bios where to change it, and i do not believe my motherboard has any fsb speed jumpers. i would hate to think that my pc is running alot slower than it could thank you for your help. ohh yeah i have phoenix bios.

7939	4	9179	108124	107734	ray harinec	1/22/04 8:05 pm	1.0748019e12	to use dual channel you must have two	sticks of ddr sdram. &quot;matched&quot; just means two sticks of the same size and speed. your mobo probably has two sets of different color ram sockets.[either a total of four or six sockets]. to use dual channel, one stick must be in the first slot of each color. keep in mind that your fsb will still be 200 mhz.[just the way that the mobo mfrs deignate things] the cpu will be running at 800 mhz memory speed. the memory must be ddr 400 [or faster], also known as pc 3200. [it is actually 200 mhz memory that gets double clocked thus is called ddr 400, kind of confusing, isn't it] the stick that you have now must be that or better in order for the system to show an fsb of 200 mhz. this info should be in the manual that came with your mobo. it is not always too clearly written due to the &quot;pidgen english&quot; used by the taiwanise authors. hopefully my explanation will help to clarify it a little,
7939	5	9179	108137	106729	ray harinec	1/22/04 8:28 pm	1.07480328e12	my error. i just checked on your mobo. it does not	support the 800 mhz fsb processor speed. the socket will accept the 800 mhz processor but the highest cpu fsb supported is 533 mhz. it does not have dual channel memory capability. thus disregard my other posts.
