hello can anyone recommend a good video card for use with maya and alias studio tools? it must be pci express (not agp), and it must cost $500 or so. thanks for your input, ------s
have you checked out the ati fire line of graphic workstation cards?
the ati radeon x850 xt pe is the best card on the market right now and will run you around 600 bucks. ever so slightly less powerful is the 800 xt, which you can buy for around 450-500.
