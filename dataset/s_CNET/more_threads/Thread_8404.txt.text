i am putting a barebones system together from tiger direct. not my first. everything seems ok but i have the 24 pin power connector on. but dont have the 12v 4 pin coming from the power supply. there was a 6 pin connector off the power supply which i plugged in, and the system booted ok.is this ok to use as is. its a thermaltake v2 case with a 450 watt psu.
this is like you asking if some unknown thing may or may not be ok with or without a connection. i can't see how any answer would be possible so let's go with common sense. the seller must answer basic questions or suffer returns. bob
that comes apart.
