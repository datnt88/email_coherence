206	5	269569	2616900	2616651	vapcmd	10/28/07 8:05 am	1.1935587e12	i'd try the hs with the double sided thermal tape.	if the tape isn't sufficient there are other thermal compounds like arctic alumina that would easily do the job.  if you need special items like speed controlled fan, fan controllers, cpu heatsinks, etc., there are lots of specialty web sites like xoxide.com, frozencpu.com, crazypc.com, coolerguys.com, etc., let us know how it works. vapcmd

206	9	269569	2618810	2616945	3151jeff	10/31/07 3:35 am	1.1938017e12	i am already running intel desktop utilities	the desktop utilitie is how i monitor my temperatures as i said before, i suspect i have a sensor problem. the temperature is not been over 63c since i installed the fan, the heatsink did nothing to reduce the temperature any further. hopefully i'm not looking at failure down the road. i am looking into replacement temperature sensors, just to be sure i appreciate all your help, thanks again

206	15	269569	2627015	2626964	dango517	11/10/07 7:30 pm	1.194723e12	some additional information	i contacted intel customer support regarding a high cpu temperature problem i was having, i implemented all of there recommendations and was disappointed with all but one. i have added a hard drive cooler and installed it in a spare cd/dvd slot i have and run it with the door propped open.  this dropped my cpu/system temperature by four degrees centigrade. all the other recommendations failed entirely. it does make a bit of noise. it took about 10 minutes to install and required no tools to install, just plug and play. this may not be your experience, however.
