how do i change my usb 1.xx ports to 2.0 so i can use the new sandisk 2.0 flash drive.
but if the ports are 1.1 because of being old, then install an add-on pci card to, also assuming, desktop computer. if it is a laptop, you might be able to add a pcmcia card to have usb 2.0 ports.
the ports themselves can't be changed, this is a physical aspect of what they are. depending on your system, you can install a pci type card that adds usb2.0 and then connect to it or any other solution such as some frt. installed gadget box(in an empty bay). if this is alaptop then some similar expresscard arrangement, etc.. check at:  tada -----willy
