i have added a external usb hdd to one of the computers on a three computer network. how do i add it to the work group? wxp sp2
and you can use it across your network. and when you power down the pc it's connected to it's not shared any more. and if you power it off it's not shared any more. it won't stay shared unless it's an internal drive. don't ask me how i know. wayne (ibm freak - 6) click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software (and a great chocolate-cherry cobbler recipe). my mini-schnauzer is smarter than your honor student.
no matter how many time my pc has been off or restarted. i believe it might be because the drive is seen in the bios by it's model # and maybe more. windows device manager doesn't see it as a generic but displays its full model #. i can disconnect it and take it to another pc. as long as i plug it back into the same usb port, everyone is happy and it remains shared.
maybe because it is a sata drive. so i just got me a longer sata cable and extended the power. it sits on my computer. slightly modded.  fast flash, the fan is spinning.
i'm not sure why you can't get it to work with usb. my external is also sata on the inside and works fine. my asus mb is 5 years old now so it's old by some standards. i can even see the external's drive letters when booting from dos disks. it would seem if you could do that you could get the hds fully id'd. perhaps the external enclosure's interface is the problem.
