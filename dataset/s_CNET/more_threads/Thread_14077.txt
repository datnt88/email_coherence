12049	9	5196	75704	75431	r. proffitt	12/22/03 7:20 am	1.0720776e12	that cdrom door.	remove the wide ide cable. if power is proper (+12v and +5v) the drive will open and close on a good drive. it would be a good idea to try the manual eject if the button fails, but cdrom units can be tested to some degree without a computer... bob
