i'm new here, and i'm not sure how to post help requests, so here goes.... win xp sp2 homemade computer with abit sd7-533 motherboard memory (ram) in mb:768 processor type:intel p4 processor speed (mhz):2.6 ghz hard drive capacity:38 gb i have a netgear fa311 network card connected to a wgr614 (v4) wireless router for my home network. it was working fine until last week -now, when i try to disable the connection, i get an error box saying: &quot;error disabling connection - it is not possible to diasble the connection at this time. this connection may be using one or more protocols that do not support plug-and-play, or it may have been initiated by another user or the system account.&quot; the error seemed to occur after my spyware software (aluria spyware remover) updated last week. this error comes up even when my computer is the only one on the network. i have tried: -system restore (which failed to restore the machine to before the spyware update) -uninstalling and reinstalling the network card using the device manager -changing the pci slot the card is in nothing seems to work. it takes much longer for my machine to boot than before, probably because it is enabling the network everytime it is started. i'd like to be able to disable my network - any help will be greatly appreciated! thanks!
and can't google out any solution.
win xp sp2 1 gb dual channel ddr3 ram p4 3.8 ghz 400 gb i have d-link dwl-520 wirless adapter installed in on of my pci slots and it was working fine. unexpectedly, it failed to disable the connection throwing up the error message. ''error disabling connection - it is not possible to diasble the connection at this time. this connection may be using one or more protocols that do not support plug-and-play, or it may have been initiated by another user or the system account.'' there are two computers on this network but no one else uses them and i have made no changes to the connection settings. i cannot find an answer to my problem anywhere and any help would be greatly appreciated thanks.
i am getting the exact same message. since nobody is jumping to our aid, lets see if we can figure this out ourselves. lets see what we have in common... 1. zonealarm free 2. symantec av corp ed 3. trojan hunter 4. counterspy i tried uninstallling zonealarm, but that didnt help. anyone of you want to participate in what kind of software you are running, maybe we can figure this out.
1.sygate personal firewall 5.6 2.ad-aware 6.0 professional 3.spyware blaster 4.spybot s&d i have another comp upstairs with almost the exact same configuration. the only difference is it's running amd. down here im running pentium 4 and im getting that error message when i try to disable the wireless adapter. upstairs i have the exact same adapter, d-link dwl-520 and it disables fine...i don't see how any running programs could affect something like this. but hey, mabye you know something i don't. my best guess is that its a corrupted .dll of some sort. looking foreward to your response.
here's some of my pc specs. system: microsoft windows xp professional version 2002 service pack 2 computer: intel pentium 4 cpu 2.53ghz 1.92 ghz, 1.00gb of ram connection: 802.11g wlan (125 mbps) ______________________________________________________ i just formatted, so i only installed my video and sound card drivers, sp2, winamp, msn and firefox. i never had the problem before with the same hardware. i conventionally know little of computers, but my guess is that windows update or the service pack is running something new pertinent to wireless connectivity. hope my input helps you solve the problem, mat.
i have mcafee security center, adaware 2007, registry booster
