is there any way to tweak a pc using the intel extreme graphics. other than upgrading firmware. adding main memory (does this help)? i hear that using all the memory slots is more bandwidth efficient than one stick in one slot, byte or byte (is that true)? reallocating dedicated memory? is there a way to overclock the chipset? its a dell 2400 with an 850e chipset and 256 mb 333mhz ram. directx 9.0.
with as much posting on this particular forum, i thought i'd get at least a sarcastic remark.
dedicated graphics card, any model, be it lower or higher end, offer major improvements over integrated. just buy a new graphics card. look into ur bios, some integrated graphics let u adjust the memory for it, so try that. adding main memory (does this help)? - any amount will speed up ur pc, but it depends on the amount set available to ur integrated graphics. i hear that using all the memory slots is more bandwidth efficient than one stick in one slot, byte or byte (is that true)? - ? reallocating dedicated memory? - see above is there a way to overclock the chipset? - why would you do that to integrated graphics? thats pointless. konny
