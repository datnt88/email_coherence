hello...upgrading a presario s4000nx.i've upgraded the ram to 1g...hard drive w/control card to 1t w/7200 rpm . i am currently running win 7rc...but my primary is xp home. what are the maximum specs in a pci video card that i can use....or will any card bwork as long as its pci??? thanks in advance. -john
there's pci and several varieties of pci express. if your pc has pci better buy such a card. if it's the right type, it will work, assuming the psu (power supply) and the cooling are up to the task. kees
thanks....i wanted to be sure. i didn't want to spend a lot of money on a card that my motherboard couldn't utilize. it is pci....old compaq....so,again..thanks for your help! -john
i too needed a pci (not pcie) card. i found the usual 8400 pci card and it works &quot;ok.&quot; i'm ordering the 9400 version this week. here's a search for it.  bob
ha!!...i had my eye on that but didn't want to pay 75 for a card my board wouldn't take advantage of!! thanks bob...i feel a lot better with your reccommendation and input. you have helped me immensely in the past (*gooslojo) and i always appreciate your help -john
