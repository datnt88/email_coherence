i want to see a wireless terminal that allows you to remote into your home computer and looks/acts like a big iphone. hardware would include a 13 inch touchscreen, an 'n' network card, a small video card, and a battery. the whole thing would remote into your home computer (or someone elses) and you could bring up a transparent keyboard on the screen with a screen gesture (terminology?). battery life would be stellar! and realistically this shouldn't cost more than $250
another description would be a wirless, dumb terminal, without a keyboard. and hopefully the possiblility to port usb devices through rdp (i don't have any knowledge in that area)
&quot;thin client tablets&quot; and &quot;smart displays&quot; without keyboard/mouse never caught on and were replaced by laptops with tablet funtionality.
the market wasn't there. here's one -&gt;  there are many more. they were burned before, why should we do this again? bob
thanks guys, of course, neither of those look very impressive, one advantage should be weight, and 3 pounds doesn't really cut it. i think they could gain a big foothold if they were done 'right': 1. have it look like this  2. include two modes: a remote desktop+usb for high bandwidth availability and a browser only functionality for low bandwidth 3. make it a little rugged and water proof. without a keyboard, it would be easy. then you could use it at home, away, or in the shower thanks again!
3lbs is about the lightest it will get with an lcd touch panel.
awesome!!! now i wonder how fast remote desktop'ing' would be over http at home thanks everyone!
netbooks are smaller laptops/notebook with xp just remote in to your base machine.
