hello, i've never posted here before, but i'm hoping for some help. i'm looking at getting a netbook for travel purposes, and just to not have to boot up my bulky 5yr old toshiba laptop all the time. i just want to be able to do quick emails/basic web stuff on the road, and the big thing is i want to be able to do skype video calls. so, my question is, what netbook do you recommend/not recommend for this? i want a built-in webcam, too. there's a special on an e-machines brand right now i was thinking about. suggestions?
look at the slight faster netbooks with that ion chipset. figure closer to 500 for this.
about 3 weeks ago i purchased an acer aspire one at costco for $300. they have a 90 day trail during which you can return it. it has 1gb ram and 160 gb hard drive. i want it for travel, checking emails, skype, etc. i love it. skype works great and connects easily to the internet. i am really happy with it. i have used and hp laptop for 6 years and tis acer is waaaay better! jim
i forgot to mention that the battery lasts 7 to 8 hours. it is a 6-cell. the netbook weighs less than 3 lbs. it has intel atom processor, windows 7, 10.1 inch screen and is about 1 inch thick. jim
runs audio skype just fine. i find it to falter when running a video chat.
