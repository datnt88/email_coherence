hello, i just built a new system with an amd athlon 64 x2 cpu. however under my computer it says amd hammer family processor - model unknow. could someone please tell me how i make it so the computer recognizes the processor for what it is? thanks!
or does your mobo even support x2s???
no i haven't tried updating the bios and it's an nvidia nforce 4 ultra mobo...
microsoft's cpu detection can be 'poor'. look up cpuid on google.com and see what it tells you. bob
well the cpuid says the same thing...does that mean it's my mobo? i've tried playing bf2 and it worked fine. since it's not detecting it right, could mean that im getting less preformance?
1. cpuid from  ? 2. the bios is the latest offered by your motherboard's maker? bob
