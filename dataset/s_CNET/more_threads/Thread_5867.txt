(i still don't understand why this was the case - why didn't it just fail to read the bad drive. talkin bout a widow-maker) for anyone counting, that's 3 logic boards down. 3. my hunch was correct about drive #2 being healthy. it was out of the housing when lacie #2 housing fried. when i reinstalled #2 drive back into the #2 housing, the housing logic board was dead, so could not pass on any further failures to the #2 drive. 4. in answer to my own question about how to get a pc/wxp box to read the former lacie #2 ata drive, all i had to do was remove a jumper on the drive, making it a slave drive. once i did that, my pc read the disc 100%, with all the old lacie formatting, partitions, etc. 5. as previously posted, my drive #1 was not running when it fried, it just failed to power-up, so i was almost certain all my data, physical disc, and heads were healthy. it was just the power. i stumbled upon a great website:  - can swapping logic boards be that easy? - and just so happens i had a torx socket sitting in my mini computer kit, unused for the last 20 years - so i popped off the healthy #2 drive logic board and installed it on the #1 drive, plugged that into my pc/wxp box and... woohoo - there's all my 320gb of data. i had recovered my own hard drive! the local data recovery shakedown joint was ready to charge me over a grand per drive (i'm sure they would have too, despite it actually being an easy fix, especially for experts in the field, this would have been nothing.) 6. i found a matching model/firmware drive on ebay cheap - sectors are bad - but all i need from it is the healthy logic board - so i will swap that in for the burnt out board on drive #1. recall, i actually had four total drives go down, so still have to find another cheap matching logic board for drive #3. 7. that leaves me sitting with four worthless lacie housing shells, all apparently with burt out logic boards of their own. plus i have to find permanent, networked new housing for the four hard drives. i don't want a whole new pc just for that. what to buy???
