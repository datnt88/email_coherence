i have super os 10.10 (ubuntu) i was wondering if it will work on a netbook? thanks in advance... muldarfbi,
be sure to check all the features. if it fails there are at least a dozen other versions to look at. bob
superos is, most likely, too heavy for a netbook. leenux is a good one, but there are many others -- please see some of the distros developed for netbooks here  not just the one the link points to. best wishes!
