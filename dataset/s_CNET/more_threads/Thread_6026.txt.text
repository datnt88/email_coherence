i'm living temporarily in an apartment complex where one of my neighbors has thoughtfully installed an open wifi access point, which i am happy to use. but it doesn't work all the time. sometimes it's fine, and sometimes there's no signal at all. (but even if i get no reception in my apartment, i know the transmitter is on because if i take my laptop down the hall, it picks up the neighbor's signal loud and clear.) is there a stronger *receiving* antenna that i can install in my apartment so i can always pick up the neighbor's signal? all the repeaters and extenders i see advertised seem to apply to the sender's location. what, if anything, can i do as the receiver?
did you really think we'd help you steal your neighbor's internet access? dw
call them and ask them to reboot their access point or turn it back on. bob
please research that option a bit more. also, you can construct a parabolic reflector from kitchen materials (i've done this at a party and at first they thought i was nuts, but afterwards they certified me... as what i was never quite sure) the dragonfly at  is some trick. this is better -&gt;  bob
you posted your email address in the clear. spam is the result since these forums are read by robots trolling for just such an entry. do you want me to delete that message for you? bob
yes, please delete the message. i thought i was sending you a message directly and not posting to the site. best, lee
