i'm considering buying a tablet but have no idea what to look for. i would appreciate any assistance. i did use an android smartphone for a while but have since discontinued it. i would like to go with a tablet that has most of the features as a smartphone. i'm assuming, like a smartphone, one can download apps such as weather aps and the like? which operating system is the best? can tablets be used like desktop computers, like, being able to wipe all data and reinstall the os? any help will be appreciated, james
for me, it's all about the apps. the os fades away as i use a browser so any os would be fine? as to the last question, so far yes. but look before you leap. an android tablet won't be something you'll find a lot of other oses for. bob
ok. hopefully i'll have one this week.
