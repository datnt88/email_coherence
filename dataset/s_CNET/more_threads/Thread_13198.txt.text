i've recently brought an old-ish computer from a friend, so you can imagine not all the install cds/manuals are there. the sound system is an altec lansing ada885. the left/right and surround speakers are working fine, however, no sound is coming from the subwoofer. the subwoofer is on and it does pass it's own diagnostic check (press a button-&gt;makes a sound). all the connections are fine. however, it never makes a sound in any windows application or game. could it be a soundcard issue? i'm using creative sound blaster! value card. it's updated to their newest version. in the sb control program, there is an option to select 2 or 4 speaker, but none for subwoofer. is it supposed to be that way? thanks for any help, i'm very new to this. windows 2000, dell demension xps b800r (600 p3, 128 rdram)
go to control panel/sound and under sound playback you pick the speaker layout. the card you have does support the subwoofer.
stereo headphones desktop stereo speakers laptop mono speakers laptop stereo speakers monitor stero speakers monitor stand stereo speakers monitor mounted stereo speakers keyboard stereo speakers quadraphonic speakers surround sound speakers 5.1 surround sound speakers these are the options that i have under control panel-&gt;sounds and multimedia-&gt;audio-&gt;sound playback-&gt;sb live! audio (df40)-&gt;advanced-&gt;speakers. i've tried just about every one of those, without any success.
the surround sound speaker setting should at least get the woofer working. maybe the speaker is defective, or is plugged in incorrectly. you should be getting sounds from it.
