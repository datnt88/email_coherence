hello guys, i have a question. i'm currently buying a new pc and i would like to know which of the two options gives me more performance. a single 750gb 7200 rpm speed, sata 3gb/s hard drive or two 320gb 7200 rpm speed, sata hard drives in raid 0. there is no specification for the 320gb drive, so i'm assuming its 1.5gb/s. which of the two options will give me a better performance? or will there be barely any difference? thanks!
that sata speed is just for the interface and not indicative of any drive speed. in fact a 3.0g drive benchmarked not much faster when we jumpered it down to 1.5 or connected it to a 1.5g interface. test then decide. bob
thanks a lot for your quick reply. guess i'll have to test it then.
