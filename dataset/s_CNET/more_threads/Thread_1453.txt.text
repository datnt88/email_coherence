hi... i'm immanuel here... i'm confused whether i'm supposed to enable the s.m.a.r.t capability for the hard disk's i have... i've got a 80gb sata hard disk and a 160gb ide hard disk.. i use windows xp and a 915 intel chipset please help... i don't want to spoil my hard disk because of a wrong setting.
my thought is to always enable smart since you need the early warning. there are however some naysayers such as vendors on ebay that don't like this. in the last case they had resold a drive that failed smart so they had no interest in what it reported. you can take what you can from that event. bob
thanks for the sugession... i got a reply in no time....
you could turn it on or off. my tests with everest just show it ok.
