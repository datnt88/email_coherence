can anyone of any software that will detect the heat inside in notebook? the reason i ask when i have my notebook on my lap it gets pretty warm. newbie to laptops.
i'll write &quot;unlikely.&quot; but the issue is well known that some desktop replacement laptops are not suited for lap use since the surface temperature can reach scalding heights. unlike a desktop which can be built by many, laptops are hopefully engineered design pieces that are rated to operate withing some range of temperature and in the case of those desktop replacement notebooks, should be on a desktop. bob
ironically, laptops shouldn't be used on a lap, but on a flat surface in order to allow venting or better heat disappation. notebooks, is the more correct term and yes, laptops/notebooks get very warm or even hot to touch. the bottom surface should be free of obstructions in order for better air circulation and/or install a notebook cooler. mothing more than fans mounted on an attachable device to help cool the notebook. this is serious stuff as many new notebooks get way too hot now and most come already with some feature to better help in this regard, installed. good luck -----willy
there's a nifty little utility out called hdd health, and i have it on both of my computers. it measures not only temperature (not in any particular unit) but also other things about your hard drive, and can even predict a possible hd failure date. at first when you install it, it says its precision is only like 25 percent, but as u keep using it, eventually it will go to 75 or 80 percent. help file is very useful.
you may want to consider getting a laptop pad such as the cyber cooler available at  i've had mine for about three months and i love it.
