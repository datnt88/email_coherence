hello i've been looking around for a tv tuner that can broadcast my tv at home back to me away from home. so far i've only been able to find the slingbox as a viable option. are there any other types of this kind of device similar to the slingbox? thanks in advance - nick
you could home-brew your own, but slingbox does all the work for you. unless you're a hobbyist, go with slingbox or get something to convert your programs to divx and burn them to cd/dvd. a single layer dvd can hold 12+ hours of divx high-res video.
something sort of like sagetv? ( - nick
