your post is not unlike a link i'll offer. i don't see what router you have.  bob
i had exactly the same problem with two laptops i had networked previously using a wired connection. after changing to a wireless connection with belkin router and network card i had no end of trouble sharing files. i got into no end of a mess trying to make it work, and eventually couldn't even access some folders on one machine on or off the network. i took my usual step when nothing else seems to work and formatted both machines and started again. making sure they both had the same workgroup names was all i needed to do other than running the xp network &quot;wizard&quot; to make it all work perfectly. i concluded there must have been some conflict with the original wired setup.
