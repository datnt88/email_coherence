my colleague bought a kingston 512mb extended memory to install on his ibook. the ibook detected the memory, and updated the total ram as 768mb (512 + 256). everything seems alright, but after working for a very short while, the ibook will stop responding. he restarts the ibook, and after a while, the machine &quot;hang&quot; again. if he removes the 512 memory, the machine will work fine. could this be the problem of the ram? or what other reasons can there be?
but you have not mentioned which ibook your colleague has, or what version of the mac os it is running. if, on removing the ram, the machine functions normally, i would suspect that the ram was faulty. pass on a little more information and we'll go from there. btw, most ram from reputable companies is warranted for life. p
ram sticks don't match on speed... or something else...
ok thank you very much. i can't get more information from him as yet because he has travelled overseas. but i'll ask him to check the ram speed. if not, he will probably exchange the ram. thank you.
