i wish to know if the abit av8 and the amd opteron 170 denmark 1000mhz socket 939 dual core are compatible.
show that it is compatible with socket 939 mobo's. just noted that it is based on the 130 nm core. why not use a standard one with a 90 nm core. they run cooler i understand.
...is compatible with any s939 motherboard and ddr ram. socket 940 opterons need a s940 board, and ecc ram, which is more expensive.
