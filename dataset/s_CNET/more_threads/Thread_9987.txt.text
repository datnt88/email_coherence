desktop with windows xp toshiba laptop with windows vista linksys wireless g wrt54g broadband router arris cable modem hp psc1400 all in one printer having problems setting up a network environment allowing my laptop to access my printer connected to my desktop. i want to be able to be in another room in the house, and print from my laptop without having to connect my laptop to the printer. i have ran the network wizard and the laptop sees the main computer name, but that is all. any help will be greatly appreciated&gt; what do i need to make this work?
do you have a duplicate account on your desktop that will authenticate you and grant access to the printer?
not sure what you mean by duplicate account, try to explain in a way ill understand.
have you log in. let's say you log in as &quot;dudley&quot;. now when you want to print to another machine's printer, &quot;dudley&quot; must have an account on the other machine. plus all the other things that need to be right as well. simple test for that. go to the other machine, log off and can &quot;dudley&quot; log in with the same name and password as the other machine?
ok thanks ill give it a try!!
we recently went through the same thing. when my husband loaded the printer driver on my laptop, everything worked fine.
hey hadnt thought of that, i actually went to a bookstore here and did some reading. and that was one thing i did not do, so im gonna give that a shot. thanks..
