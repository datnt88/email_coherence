5210	8	224848	2357231	2357159	vapcmd	12/26/06 6:54 pm	1.16715924e12	lesson's learned	by the time you add up all the 'better, higher performance stuff' you have to buy for overclocking, you could just get the better cpu and forget the overclocking. for some, it appears the goal is reaching the highest clock speeds...vice running the pc for it's intended use. vapcmd

5210	10	224848	2357684	2357420	vapcmd	12/27/06 10:15 am	1.1672145e12	chassis fans are a necessity in most pcs and	fans to cool hdds can be very helpful too. ultra cool makes a 3.5&quot; x 5.25&quot; frame with an 80mm or 92mm fan called the uc-002. so it fits a 3.5&quot; bay or 5.25&quot; bay and can make a big difference on the hdd temp. good luck vapcmd
