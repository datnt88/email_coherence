i am running xp professional on my dell pc. it's only a year old, and have recently downloaded the netscape 8 browser. every time i turn my pc on, i get lot's of pop-ups, and have been told by many friends to turn off internet explorer, because it does not have the pop up blockers built in like netscape 8 , and the firefox browsers. please help!!!
the newest version does, so i dont think its related to that. download ad aware and scan for ad ware and do virus scans. konny
or make netscape default? if either of these are what your going for just ask and as for turning of ie, it's built into windows you can't &quot;turn it off&quot; but you should do spyware scans if your getting a lot of pop-ups and ads
what you describe is exactly what can happen with messenger. out of the blue, even with no browsers open, you will get pop-ups on your screen. go to my site below, scroll down to the free software link, and download one or both of two messenger utilities. one will disable messenger &quot;mesenger disable&quot;, the other will uninstall it, &quot;shoot the messenger&quot;. if you like messenger (i hate it) just disable it as it can be reenabled later. i recommend uninstalling it. wayne give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the internet and they won't bother you for weeks. click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections, spyware removal, and data, and download free software.
the im client? no i was talking about the netsend messanger program go into start &gt; run &gt; msconfig click services and then disable messanger
ok, thanks for your help.
go to start, and look near the top, there should be an icon called &quot;set program acess and defaults&quot; if its not there, seach for it. from there you can change what browser you'd like to use. -ibrahim
