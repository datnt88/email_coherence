hey i got a wireless network through my house however it seems to go down everytime the phone rings, which is in the same room, and also wireless, but not voip, is there any way i can fix this modem and router r linksys router is wireless-g isp is comcast
further apart..... change the wireless channel of the router.... buy a 5.8ghz or 900mhz phone.
yea we have 2.4ghz phones so the 5.8 ghz phones will work?
you want to keep the phone frequencies as far away from the router frequencies as possible.
these phones should be fine. i had the same problem with 2.4 ghz phones causing my wireless connection to drop. wireless network uses netgear rangemax and netgear usb. even though computer signal was strong the phones would kick it out whenever a wireless 2.4 ghz was anwered. it didn't matter if the phone was not even near the router or usb. i have 4 wireless phones throughout the house now on 5.8 ghz including one near (&lt;8 ft.) to the router and another within a foot of the usb. no problems at all now with phone interference. the nice thing about the 5.8 ghz is that many can go up to 8 lines. they are pricier than 900 mhz phones. the 5.8 ghz have much better range though. so if moving the router doesn't work out, the move to another phone frequency should.
