hi guys. just attached an image of what im trying to achieve with my home network. technically speaking, does this mean that my router 2 (n600) will have to be configured as an access point? just a few clarifications. router 1 will be on the ground floor router 2 will be on the upper floor there is only one internet connection which is coming into router 1. this has to be shared with router 2 so that people on the upper floor can also use the internet via router 2. internet on router 2 also required for media reciever to play youtube, etc. router 2 will also be used to connect a network hard drive which i intend to use to store my media files (music movies), and use for viewing content stored on it via a media reciever.
looks like my image didnt get attached with my post...
these forums don't allow for inserting or attaching images, so if you want to do that, upload your image to your favorite image hosting site, flickr, imageshack, and so on, then post the link to that 'full sized image' in a post here. hope that helps. mark
