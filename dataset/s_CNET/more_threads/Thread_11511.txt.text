don't know anything about computers except that i use them on daily basis. i don't want to spend more than $800-900. have dsl. want to be able to burn cds, download pictures, need word, excel, internet access. what can/should i get? i don't need sth. incredible, but sth. that would last me for the next 5 years and be fast, and not freeze all the time. thanks so much for your help.
it may do all that without the issues of windows. today's spware and more make the pc a nonchoice for what you want (no lockups.) bob
lots of options...might just make it easy and get a basic dell....just make sure you have enough ram...at least 512mbs (1 gb if you get oboard video), enough disk space...100 gbs, a 19' monitor, and a cd-dvd reader writer....you could get the el cheapo cd-rom drive from dell and get a cd-dvd writer of your choice from newegg or elsewhere. as far as the software is concerned...unless you absolutely positively need the real deal, just use openoffice 2.0. regards, vapcmd
