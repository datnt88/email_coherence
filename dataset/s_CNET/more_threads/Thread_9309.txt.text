since a few days, home and end keys don't work. if, for example, i'd want to go to the beginning of this post, i'd have to use cursor keys or the mouse, too bad. i can't figure out why is this happening. i have winxp with service pack 2. any idea?
happened after sp2? (clue) or a &quot;keylogger&quot; virus?
if you bring up word or wordpad and type in a few words and hit home or end do you have the same problem. do you have the same problem with both sets of home/end keys. can you try a different keyboard?
yes, the problem is the same in any program i try. both sets of home/end keys? do you mean repag/avpag? if so, they work ok. i could buy a different keyboard, but i don't think that's the problem. all other keys work perfectly, and these two ones have ceased to work at the same time. curious...
i can't remember exactly if it happened a little after or a little before installing sp2. i'm sure it didn't happen just after sp2. i'll pass spybot to see if it's a keylogger.
no keylogger found, i was wondering, could it be the generic driver that windows uses for this keyboard is not correct? the keyboard has 105 keys.
every standard keyboard has 2 home and 2 end keys. one set on the number pad and the other between it and the keyboard off. do both sets fail to work? go to housecall.antivirus.com and run a virus check to see if you have a worm.
can you believe i never noticed that!!! i always used the set between the numpad and the rest of the keyboard. those are the ones that don't work. the ones in the numpad (7 and 1) work ok. i'll run that virus check right now (anyway i have kaspersky running as resident).
is set up automatically on at boot. this can be changed in &quot;setup&quot; (bios). may be the reason num pad works and other keys don't. per session, without bios change, you can toggle the num lock on-off.
