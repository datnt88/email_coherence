2436	5	528437	5141006	5140998	wein3150	5/31/11 12:19 pm	1.30684434e12	ok	the final question is the setup of the server. i have a residential account - i think a comcast business account is required to set up and run a web server. i want ssh secure internet access, i need to access both and internet server and a ssh server on the same machine- correct?
2436	6	528437	5141027	5141005	wein3150	5/31/11 12:42 pm	1.30684572e12	a tad more secure being	over 1024? for example

2436	8	528437	5141032	5141018	wein3150	5/31/11 12:58 pm	1.30684668e12	i guess	i am confused about whether or not i need to set up an internet server or not if i am outside my home network and want ssh access to the internet. the app ssh tunneling (android market) gives the user ssh internet access. it seems too simple to just configure a windows sshd on my home pc via port forwarding and get all that safe internet power..... doesn't make sense to me, i guess.

2436	13	528437	5141654	5141623	wein3150	6/1/11 11:32 am	1.30692792e12	sure, that's fair	with regards to networks at work. what about wifi in the public domain. i assume you're saying that, in reality there is no safe place to be totally free of internet snoopers. this is a disturbing reality i can't seem to shake off. no safe surfing? i don't know....

2436	16	528437	5141680	5141667	r. proffitt	6/1/11 11:47 am	1.30692882e12	you mean that gsm base station issue?	finds it. years ago when base stations were in the 6 figure price range that made it part of the security &quot;package.&quot; what happened was the protocols and such were not well done and we are beginning to see issues develop. the major players are attempting to fix all this as well as play down concerns. what stops them cold from a solid fix is the millions of handsets and base stations that would have to be changed. bob

2436	18	528437	5350996	5141666	izmirlig	8/23/12 8:47 pm	1.34575482e12	this whole thread has moved off topic	and in the most idiotic way possible. the original question: why can't you just do ssh through the default port over the cellular network? (apologies for shouting but some people are like....really deaf) but ssh is rsa encripted so that packet snooper better be able to beat tmrsa encription and wade through an aweful lot of crap to get my credit card number...and oh....wait...my cellular provider which is one if the most uscrupulous ******** on the planet alrady has my credit card number, bob so....you were juzt saying....?
