im wondering how do you get your internet connection over 100mbps. i have a switch that transfers 200mbps, and a cat6 cable that can transfer 200mbps also. does that mean i just need to find an ethernet port to connect up to 200mbps?
100 up and 100 down = 200 total. go faster? get 1gbit networking parts. bob
okay i awnt a faster internet for games...and i have a laptop. should i get a gig usb ethernet adapter, or a gig cardbus ethernet adapter?...this is for home to so i kinda want it usb so i can put it in a hub and when im on the go...i just unplug the hub instead of all the other usb cords. but im worried that the usb transfer around 450mbps....so how would it transfer 1 gig?....which should i get?
all this will not help your internet gameplay but would help in copying files and such to/from machines in your lan. for gamers, they want a wired connection to the dsl/cable modem and even they they'll complain on just about any laptop made. bob
going to a gigabit switch which is 10/100/1000 will not help your internet gameplay. you connection from your isp doesnt even come close to maxing out the 10/100 card your using. at the most your isp is likely putting out 10mbps, and your ethernet card can handle 100mbps. going to a gigabit switch will only help transfering files from pc to pc, not the internet speeds. hope this helps.
