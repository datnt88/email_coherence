i have a rosewill smartone case, i have 7x120mm fans, one in the front, one in the back, one on top, two on the left side, and two on the right side i cut and installed myself to pull heat off of the back of my motherboard. the one in the front is going in, the one on top is out, the one on back is out, the one on the left side is blowing air down on to the cpu, the second one on the left side is a highflow fan and its pulling air out away from my crossfired cards, i was wondering if there was a better way to arange them to get lower temps,the cpu is idleing around 30c, load at 60c, the cards idle at 32c and top out around 65c on crysis maxed.
you'll have to test each combination of direction and measure where it goes. put all that into some spreadsheet so you can make your decision. here i would not change a thing since the numbers look ok. bob
im wanting to start ocing soon, so i would like to have the temps down a little lower than that, but i think what you said will be a good idea, thanks.
then you would not stop at doing the test as well as doing what all overclockers do such as installing better cooling systems. bob
i belive there is a little cooling to be gotten out of what i already have, i dont have the money to go buy a new cooling system right now.
what many discover after doing this a few dozen times is that there is no correct way to arrange fans. there are guides but only by changing and testing do you find if your custom setup is better or worse in each arrangement. then again, many just leave the side cover off and they're done. bob
