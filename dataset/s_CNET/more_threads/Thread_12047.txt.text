im running xp home. i have 2 gig of ram and a dual core amd processor, yet when i print a document the printer queue seems to cause my mouse to jump. is there a way i can install some sort of print spooler that will give me 100% of my computers resources back to me asap?
a dot matrix or a chain drive?
its a brother 3240c all in one ink jet printer
because you didn't tell us which printer. two things i would do. 1. go to the brother site and look for updated drivers. 2. look for a device conflict. control panel, system, hardware, device manager. with the printer turned on, click the mouse and other point devices + sign and double click the mouse. click the resources tab. if there's a conflict, options to correct this will be displayed.
