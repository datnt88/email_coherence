no make, model or link to the machine's manual so i'll just write &quot;bios setting.&quot;
as stated by robert, you can reboot or once power is returned to system cause a reboot of that system. however, because this is a power issue, its far better to allow it to sit out until &quot;stable power&quot; is present. if the power is erratic or on/off as it were, repeated reboots/start-ups could corrupt the system. i suggest you have a more protected system as in stand-by power, line conditioner and surge protection in all or varied forms. having this will reduce any real or reduce damage to h/w and/or reduce some s/w corruption or allow a proper shutdown at least. if your power problems are constant than this is your best way to help yourself. i offer this as the post you supplied provided little info. tada -----willy
ups (uninterruptible power supply) or sometimes called a battery backup.
