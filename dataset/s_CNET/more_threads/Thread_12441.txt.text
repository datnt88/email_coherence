website and check which brands of memory that they have verified to work with that mobo and cpu.
check the mb mfg ...the website and the mb manual for their qualified vendor list (qvl) for ram. they will list ram that's compatible with your mb. the other approach is ... go to the various ram vendor sites ...corsair, crucial, kingston, etc. for ram guaranteed to work with your pc. vapcmd
