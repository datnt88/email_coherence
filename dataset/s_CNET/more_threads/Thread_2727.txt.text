hi there, my router seems to be frozen with all lights on. with power cord in, i tried resetting per the dlink website, but after several seconds of holding the reset button in, it stays frozen. i also tried something called a &quot;recovery reset&quot; and that didn't work either. anyone have any ideas? thanks!
try a newer router.
i was afraid that it would be too old. i think that i bought it about 2 years ago. i wasn't sure if that was too long. i didn't know what the expiration date for it would be. just hoping for an alternative solution. thanks for your advice.
