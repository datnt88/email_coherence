hello i got an imac and i'm looking for an external hard drive that i need. i don't record or do movies and games. i've got music, pictures, docs done in excel and word. i'm not sure what to get: -portable or non-portable -what size? 1tb or less than 1tb -what brand that is compatible to a mac? i appreciate your recommendation or suggestion. thanks, jake
you don't really make clear what you need it for and why you need it. that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to give a sensible advice. kees
my apple friend squealed with delight when i showed them my 32gb usb micro drive. i put a 32gb microsd card into this -&gt;  it's compatible with their apple intel mac pro. bob
&quot;how much do you need?&quot; was what i meant to write.
backup files this is what i need that is why i asked.
