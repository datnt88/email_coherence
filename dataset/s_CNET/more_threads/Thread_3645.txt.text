ok i have a question, as we all do. i had windows xp on my old computer and something in it died. the geek squad said it was a green chip in the mother board. i am not savvy on the lingo as you can tell. so i bought a new hp with vista. it seems to work pretty good for me. my question is what to do with the drive in my old computer. i heard you should not just throw it away because it contains alot of stuff. can i hook it up to my new one or have my it guy at work load it on a disk or beat it with a hammer? hope to get an answer. thanks
you could remove the hard disk and put that in a case like these  the rest could be tossed out on freecycle.com bob
i guess i could open up the old computer and see what your talking about.
this thing can be used as a usb drive
