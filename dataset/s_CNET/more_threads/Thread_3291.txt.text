hi all, is that possible to ping another computer with it's firewall on? i am unable to ping the computer in my living room using my laptop. please kindly advise. thanks.
but it is possible to turn off the ping response. bob
but if i cannot ping another computer, i will not be able to access the files in it.
as such, you need to decide.
firewalls can be setup to block a ping, but to allow file sharing. the easiest thing maybe to add the second pc into the trusted zone on the firewall, which will allow all traffic from the pc to the firewall to get through.
