i am trying to install the third internal hard drive inside my sony vaio computer case. there are only two bays for the hard drives. there is enough space for the third one, though. does anyone know what kind of brackets i could use to install the third drive? is there a site i can purchase a bay for one drive or some kind of hardware which will hold the drive in place? thanks a lot. alex.
bay down to a 3 1/2?? if so go to:  search for item 161 0410 that's it.
i am looking for additional bay for the third drive.
are you aware that a hard drive can be mounted in any orientation?? on its side, upside down. seems that if you have space, mounting should just take some kind of a kludge. of course getting the ribbon cable to it with another drive on the cable may be a real challenge.
just tape the thing under the lowest harddrive bay. it'll work fine... ^_^
of kluge [variation of spelling] lol but you posted it as a reply to me. your reply was actually intended for the originator of the post i believe.
