[btw, when i came back home i had no problems with the comp.!] i installed it and everything was fine even outside my building. about 10 days later, i started having problems at home. very slow response to action, frozen screen with the mouse moving but unable to click and finally the blue screen thing again! i read online about someone having the same problem and installed updates for my compaq 2100. nothing changed. today, i finally decided to remove d-link and couple other things. i ran the registry mechanic, hijackthis, ad-ware and stuff like that, even clean up. i kept having the same problem. after the blue screen the computer reboots and can never fully reload. it either stops at a certain point frozen or when i try to press f8 it wouldn't respond and continue until some point. i also tried to run the safe mode but it wouldn't do it. the last good version thing did not work... i just turn it off, let it cool down and try again. it starts running fine until a certain point when it grows lazy, freezes and gives me the finger [blue screen and all that sh... crap all over again]. sorry for the long explanation. hope someobody will suggest something useful thanks in advance, attila
