my computer has started doing something odd. it doesn't load &quot;num lock&quot; on boot. i have to do it manually, or not be able to use the keypad(numbers,+/*,etc) on the right hand side of the keyboard. while trivial, it is irritating. i have found no way to change this short of re-installing the os. it is a standard 101/102 ps/2 keyboard. is this a sign of a dying keyboard? doesn't seem likely. while a dual-boot win 98se/mandrake 10 system, haven't been in linux lately to see if it is doing it there. any ideas? chuck
been mucking about in the bios lately? most have a numlock on/off at bootup setting.
i have seen this problem before, and it has not been resolvable. some systems just don't leave it on all the time, even if the bios and windows are both correctly configured to leave it on. check out this article for settings windows to leave it on, but i have found it to be enabled and numlock still would not stay on until pressed, so it may not help.
thanks, sheila and jeff. haven't knowingly changed num lock settings in the bios, but anything is possible. actually, i was just wondering about that. will double-check that and go through the microsoft info jeff supplied. chuck
it was indeed clicked off in the bios. how in h,=-=\ it got that way i don't know. not something i have ever changed. chuck
