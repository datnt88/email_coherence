did advanced search on canon and info that came up was 1 to 2 years old i have had it with hp. after buying over a dozen hp printers over past 20 years, seeing hp quality steadly go down hill, i am looking to buy a canon all-in-one printer. i am looking at various canon printers (prefer under $150) and would appreciate input on opinions of which is best for ink usage, decent draft printing and reliability. (my current hp aio locks up after about every 3 use) i don't print photos, so photo print quality not important. thanks ben
why buy cheap printers? i picked up the hp k550 and it's not your typical consumer fair. as long as you get those consumer printers you might find they expire in 1 to 2 years. same issue exists for all the makers. bob
hp is an ink hog, and i am individual user not needing high powered printer anymore. (retired) (...and again giving more problems than they used to) ben
where did you read that it was? and it was not that expensive. the speed of the printing and the fine paper handling is great. again, why not move out of the consumer printing group of printers?
might be a driver issue. did you look here for updated drivers, utilities and firmware?  rick
