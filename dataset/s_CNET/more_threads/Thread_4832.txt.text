hi, really hope you guys could help me find some answers. i've got a 2 month old 320gb transcend storejet mobile [one of those drop tested, unopenable ones]. was working fine all this while, but i got a new motherboard fixed over the weekend and it stopped working ever since i connected it to the front usb drive. i got a 'problem with the usb drive error - malfunction - please try reconnecting or change device'. i tried using it in my laptop, but it does not get recognized anymore. i can feel the hdd starting and spinning as i connect it, but nothing else happens - the led blinks for a fraction of a second when i connect it but thats all. i opened the comp up and found out that the guy had installed my front usbs with the +5v and gnd interchanged. my other usb stuff work fine now, but i really need the data on my disk. is there any way i can get it to work? i'd really like an idea please. finney i
the same solutions we use everyday applies here. get another case. read
mine is still under warranty so i'm kinda stuck. i wouldn't mind opening the casing to get the data but i'm afraid of losing both data and warranty on it... do manufacturers help get data back if replaced under warranty?
so far, no.
thanks a bunch anyways. any chance that it might show up on linux? in windows, it does not get recognized at all...
something you should try. asking is fine but if you are reading other discussions you know you have to try such things. -&gt; bottom line. is the data worth the cost of a new case or not? bob
