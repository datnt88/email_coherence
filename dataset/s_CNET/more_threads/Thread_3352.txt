4446	8	156757	1742051	1740471	mr_tinka	2/14/06 3:52 am	1.13988912e12	pwr	the motherboard has been used previously and didn't come with a manual. will look online for docs. the square one has '12v pwr' printed next to it. the rectangular one has '1x4 pwr' printed next to it and looks like the power socked on the back of optical drives (male connector - 4 pin). i've noticed sata printed on it somewhere (i'm at work so i can't look. what is sata?

4446	13	156757	1743153	1742346	willy	2/14/06 12:56 pm	1.13992176e12	some good ones	unfortunely there are so many brands, more than ever it can be pretty much a hassle. i recommend antec,enermax, vantec, and i believe fortec or fortac. the most trusted and reliable brand is pcpower&cooling(very $) but darn good check thier website of same name. tada -----willy
