i have an hp desktop that came with an agp video card that has died. i have an nvidia pci card that i installed and have display. i have been reading that the motherboard supports only one type. obviously mine would support the agp as it was in it when bought. can i do this or do i have to buy another agp.
you shouldn't have any problem. good luck.
the pci card is very old. if you don't change the motherboard, buy another agp card instead of it. this one is pretty good. link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp?product_id=68165
sapphire hd5770 is a good card. connectors: displayport, hdmi, dual dl-dvi-i support ati crossfirex technology link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp?product_id=73077
