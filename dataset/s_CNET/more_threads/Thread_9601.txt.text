epson has had archival priter ink for several years. i find that they will not recycle used cartridges w/o a $5 - $10 fee! (outrageous) anyway, hp seems to have a fairly fade proof ink but i can't get &quot;vivera&quot; ink for my printer. i use a photosmart c5580 and use 75xl and 74xl. has anyone an opinion on the ink and it's permanance? have you found the color to be fade proof??? macseven
i just go to staples and hand them back in for their bucks. as to fade proof. isn't that fade &quot;resistant&quot;? i'm seen claims of fade proof but after putting such in the arizona desert sun for 5 years it did fade. also, the paper matters too. but you can research more about low acid or acid free/neutralized papers. bob
will staples take epson empties?? office max says that only ink empties with &quot;heads&quot;? can be recycled. epsons don't have that configuation. if staples will take my epsons, i will give them all of my business. you're right about the fade 'proof'. only resistant can be expected. years ago, only epson had long lasting ink. the old photos printed with my old hp faded within a week, but their newer inks are almost fadeless. thanks for the response. macseven
&quot;retail customers can recycle any ink or toner cartridge, up to 10 per calendar month per customer, and receive $3 back in staples rewards per cartridge. learn more here.&quot; it's not a perfect program but it is one i use. bob
