i have sony vaio vgc-rc210g it comes with an ati x300 pci-e. needless to say it's a bit low on the gaming scale. so i was looking to upgrade to say an ati 1900 xtx, or similar. i was wondering if any one with a rc210g has upgraded there graphics card and to what, ati, nvidia? also how well it works for you?
...looks ominous! maybe that model only got one sale? judging from reviews such as :  sony uses a massive amount power, and like all things with a big name badge, it likely doesn't come with an over specified psu . in other words, it already uses a lot of power, and the psu it comes with will not be an expensive model with a massive overhead for a huge 3d upgrade. huge? the graphics card you're after requires more power than any other option which is likely to be doomed to failure in a ynos pc:  you'd only be compounding possible problems, and you might have to consider a psu upgrade, which may or may not (the latter is more likely) be an option. or you could opt for a graphics card which doesn't draw so much power. no doubt with a trendy ynos, something as horrible (even though it works) as this would be out of the question too :  good luck in your endeavours though, gb.
thanks for the info.
