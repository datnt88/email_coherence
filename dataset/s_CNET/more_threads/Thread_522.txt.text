just a bit of advice, i've just started overclocking and want to see what the max voltage i can safely send to my cpu as ive been told that this will help increase my fsb speed, here's my setup - asus a7v600 (kt600 chipset) motherboard athlon xp 2400+ 512mb 2700 samsung ram radeo 9800 pro 450w power supply initially, the fsb was set to 133/33 in the bios, this gave me a cpu speed of 1.99ghz, i've took it step by step to 149/33 (anything above this and the pc won't start), this gives me a speed of 2.23ghz. however, as stated above, i've been told that if i increase the voltage going to cpu, i can overclock even further. the current voltage is 1.650v. what can i safely increase this to so i don't damage the cpu?
with more voltage and heat, you are decreasing the life of the component. it's a simple issue, but your choice to trade off speed for life. bob
so if it's got a reasonable heatsink and fan on it, this should help matters. it's top temprature at the moment is 46 degrees c. that's when i'm in the bios, i'm led to believe that this puts a 100% load on the cpu. windows is averaging around 40-43 degrees. whats the acceptable temprature limit?
