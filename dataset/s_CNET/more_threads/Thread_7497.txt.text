i'm moving overseas in the middle of february, and i want to buy a 15&quot; basic macbook pro to be my primary computer while i'm there. i was waiting for any updates at macworld last week, but there was nothing! just all this fancy talk about the mb air. i have till the end of february... should i just go ahead and buy one? i heard they might update the cpu chip and put a multitouch trackpad. will i be crying if i don't have those features?
with led backlighting, etc. it's too soon for another hardware update. one biggy here. check that warranty to see if it covers you when you move to another country.
