hey, i have a fairly great computer with a gtx660 and a i7 3770, but lately one monitor just seems too little, so im upgrading my gpu to a gtx 690 and adding a few monitors to my setup. but of course like any sensable person, i want to be sure that if i put in a 690 it wont **** everything up with bottlenecking my cpu, so is a i7 3770 capable of keeping up with gtx 690?
the i7 3770 cpu should have no problem at all keeping up with it. more of a concern would be the power supply. that card calls for a 650 watt minimum supply it says at full load it draws about 300 watts.
&quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines. &quot;
