hi i want to build a gaming desktop pc in which i can play dx11 games smoothly at highest settings with no or mnor lagging.specs should be like at least a quad core processor, 4gb or more ram, a fast graphics card supporting dx11, pixel shader 5, 1gb memory and support for sli/crossfire, 200 gb+ hard disk, an dvd-r/rw drive supporting dual layer dvd burning, a nice sound card, and a good motherboard. windows 7 ultimate 32/64 bit.the price should not be much high.
crysis 2, assassin's creed brotherhood, prototype, splinter cell conviction, ghost recon future soldier, need for speed shift, hot pursuit 3, battlefield bad company 2 etc.
what's the price range you're looking at, this can affect what you're willing to upgrade or downgrade to ? do you want to run with nvidia or ati graphics ? intel or amd ? custom built or &quot; off-the-shelf &quot; ?
