full connectivity for dell 2300mp projector includes: -vga -s-video -composite video -component video -rs-232 connectors i'm looking for a solution which will allow my macbook (osx) to stream video via my wireless network to a dell 2300mp projector. my tv is already set up w/built-in wifi and i'd like to bring it all together somehow if possible. i came up with the following but i stand to borrow some knowledge on this subject. all help on this question is highly appreciated. my configuration: 1. warpia wireless usb pc to tv audio / video display adapter ($115) 2. 15 hd/new db/15 vga/svga kvm gender changer adapter male to male m-m ($2) 3. possibly vmware fusion 4, (for mac os x) esd ($50) am i on the right track here? i'd like the quality to be as optimal as possible given the types of connections the dell 2300mp offers. any thoughts?
since only one of those connections is over 480 lines, you should use the vga connection. the rs232 is not for video but control so i am left to guess why it was on the list. bob
understanding vga to be my source, will my configuration work to solve my video transmission needs. (see first thread) my configuration: 1. warpia wireless usb pc to tv audio / video display adapter ($115) 2. 15 hd/new db/15 vga/svga kvm gender changer adapter male to male m-m ($2) 3. possibly vmware fusion 4, (for mac os x) esd ($50)
if the vendors you listed will not answer this, do not buy them,. it's a shame they want your sale but not to answer your pre-sales question. bob
