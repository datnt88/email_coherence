2788	3	190501	2066685	2063696	geebee	7/13/06 4:51 am	1.15276626e12	a generic error...	...across virually all windows platforms, that says the computer failed to find the operating system! it does that by looking for a few vital but hidden system files on the hard drive....if it can't find these, you get the &quot;ntldr not found&quot; (nt loader) error. if you've just installed the operating system from cd, without any problems, it's a good indicator that you'll likely have to enter your computer bios, and set boot &quot;hard drive #1&quot; first. it's likely set to &quot;boot from cd&quot; at the moment, which dending on hardware can stop the system booting from hard drive, even if that is listed as another boot option. good luck, geebee.
