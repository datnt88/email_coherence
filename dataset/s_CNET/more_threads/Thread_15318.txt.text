i have checked this forum and found the same problem as mine!! but the information i want is not there ? when i have my comp on and then put my laptop on i get this message what i want to know is what is causing this and how can i fix it ? is it something to do with the ip address on my desktop or laptop not set to automatic ? if so how do i get to the place to put things right? i am running windows xp pro on both comps, i dont know what other information you may need but if you do kindly please ask and i will supply willingly ? thank you for any help.
but i will note this forum has a sticky top post with forum preferred settings. try those next.
sorry but you've lost me ?? what are you trying to tell me ??
...you'r being sarcastic aren't you ?? i always thought this was a friendly place where us newbies could ask for help but you just proved me wrong thanks for nothing bob and i hope you get out of the right side of the bed tomorrow. but i would like to just say thank you to all others who have helped me in the past.
i want to help you out but try the forum sticky post and those settings first. with so many needing help this gets the usual out of the way. if you need personal service then pay for it. this is free so help others by using the sticky so we get to help more folk. there are a few that consider this rude but i can't imagine why. do tell! bob
the forum preferred setup is in the posts at the top of  wep is well known to cause the issues you are seeing. also the forum preferred settings work to avoid other common problems. if you want to discuss your setup, please post the details. unlike paid support you have to pitch in and help others help you. bob
