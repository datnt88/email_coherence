anyone know if it is possible to run your computer into your stereo similar to a cd player, etc. i would like to be able to run my computer through it so i could listen to my audio files out of my stereo throughout the house. thanks for all the great insight on this board.
can't remember the name of the cable, has a headphone jack on one end, red and white rca jacks on the other. connect the headphone jack into the speaker out from your pc and the red and white rca jacks into one of the aux inputs on your stereo.
you would use the &quot;line out&quot; connection. as mentioned, you will need one that splits the signal into the two channels. radio shack probably has such. however, you will have some problems if the cable is of much length. the longer it needs to run, the more likely it will pick up noise and especially 60 cycle hum. impedance match is important so check to be sure your line out and auxillary ports match in this category. get high quality (cost more) cables if you go further than 6 to 10 feet.
if your stereo has input in the form of typical audio input (the red and white holes) you can go to radio shack and pick up a cable that has the headphone size plug on one end and the red and white ends on the other. i think this would be the most basic of all the solutions.
good of you to repeat what has already been said.
