my thinkcentre s50 is displaying an error message &quot;1962 no operating system found&quot; i brought it on ebay and it did not have an rescue and recovery disk. i've been trying to find an iso file but no luck. i tried their r&r disk but i can't create the disk because the software is lenovo enabled and i can't run the software anywhere else. any thoughts?????? thanks
1. contact the ebay seller and ask for the cds. 2. contact lenovo and buy the restore cds. 3. buy xp or whatever os you want and install it. 4. do any of the above or other and discover the hard disk has failed. this is just to help you find out all the usuals about this issue. can you share what your backup plan is now? there are those linux livecds we can use to save files if need be. bob
and see if the hidden partition is still there. if so you can restore it.
