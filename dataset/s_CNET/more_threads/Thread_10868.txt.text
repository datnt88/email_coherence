i have added a new printer to my computer but i cant install it because the cd rom isn't working.
dvd recorders are under 40 bucks. fix that? bob
does any other cd work in your cd drive? was there a problem before? is this a real old drive or one that had alot of use? is the cd drive seen under &quot;my computer&quot;? look into all that and if nothing seems to work, then consider the cd drive is kaput and needs to be replaced. understand some drives may play music but not read data, replace. if there is any error, what does it state. tada -----willy
