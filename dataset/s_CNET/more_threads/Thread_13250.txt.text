i've got a hd tv (hd ready (720p / 1080i) ) and i have it hooked up to normal tv, and then i have a agp cable coming from my pc (ati radeon hd 3650) to the agp port on the tv. thing is when i'm watching video on it, i get black lines moving up the screen. and i don't like it. currently i had a dvi to agp converter for the cable, but i was wondering, if i got a dvi to hdmi converter instead, and plugged into the hdmi port of the tv, would i get a better picture quality?
your agp card doesn't have agp output port. what does the manual say about output ports that you have. if you have a dvi output connection, then all you need a is a cable that has dvi connector in one end and hdmi connector on the other end.
did you mean vga? pc to tv? agp? if you are just trying to use your big screen as a monitor, vga should be fine, dvi to dvi should be a bit better, which means not a converter but a cable. hdmi encompasses both video and audio so in order to take advantage of those functions you would need an hdmi card in the pc and of course and hdmi cable. there can be a lot of variables, depending on what you are trying to do and system capability (computer) can have a lot to do with the outcome.
