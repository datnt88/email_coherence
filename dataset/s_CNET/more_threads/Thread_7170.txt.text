i wasn't sure where to post this, but i'm a cis student about to take a microsoft windows server class online, and i'm looking to buy a used server just to fool around with. i'm currently looking at a used - dell poweredge sc1425 blade server for about $200. but i've always worked with desktops, i know little about servers. if someone has any other suggestions on what to look for to deploy an os over a small network, please let me know. should i look at a server like this or just build a desktop type server?
i have for years used old gear to test server setups on. i'd use anything for the task you are describing. bob
the only reason i'm looking at this server is because i can get one for $100 with all the parts. i'd rather a tower, but for the price....
these usually go into a box that holds the blades. be sure you are getting the entire ready to load unit. bob
