i just purchased a kensington 33085 usb bluetooth adapter off ebay. the drivers are only for xp, so how am i supposed to install this pos on 64 bit vista? i'm lost...
did you go to  and download kensington bluetooth usb adapter 2.0 (rev. 5.1.0.1700 and rev. 6.0.1.5100) ?
this is a 30 day trial. how do i go around that? it works now, but it wont in 30 days. any others that are free/no trials?
if you think they are, please get your money back.
the toshiba bluetooth managaer says it is only a 30 day trial. so yes, the drivers will still work after 30 days, but how do i transfer files without a manager/file transfer app? i must be missing something... all i want to do i transfer files between my cell phone. i'm thinking the usb cord is faster and more efficient...
you want to buy a dongle that comes with all things vista. here i didn't install the &quot;manager&quot; but use vista's native bluetooth manager. sorry but i don't duplicate web content or help content included with the os. i only fill in the hard to find items. bob
i'm not stupid... i have a dell studio 540 i purchased recently, and it's running 64 bit vista premium. when i go to control panal/hardware and sound, all i get is bluetooth local com, which is not a bluetooth wizard, just a list of com ports. if i search for bluetooth wizard, i get no result. it is also not in the accessories file like everyone says. when i run fsquirt.exe, i get an error saying windows cannot find it. how do i not have the wizard/where can i get it?
if not, you ask dell where they hid it. that is, if they supplied the oem version of the os. bob
