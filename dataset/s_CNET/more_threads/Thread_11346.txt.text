i'm the editor of a small bi-annual newsletter. i'd like to be able to record telephone interviews and have it go directly to my computer (imac g4 desktop 10.3.9). anyone know of reliable hardware/software to do this?
audiocorder will record telephone conversations, by running a phone line to your modem. before i got rid of my land line i used it every once in a while, and it worked pretty good. it's shareware, so look for it at the usual places, like  lampie
thanks.
