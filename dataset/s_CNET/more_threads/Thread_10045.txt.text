i've been waiting for any sign of a release date for the aivia xenon mouse/track pad from gigabyte or if it's been scrapped. could somebody shed some light on this??
there is a video on youtube of someone with the mouse:  also, on the gigabyte uk website it says it has been released, however, only one of the three shops they say it is available in actually sell it and they are a distributor which means they are trade only. i hoped this helped jhb019
thanks that helps....i need this mouse!!!
