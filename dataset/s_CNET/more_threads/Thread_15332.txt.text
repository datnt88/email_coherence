i have western digital external hard drive that is compatible with both pc and mac. it was working fine with both and now it does not work with pc. when i connect it with mac, i am able to view all the files and can copy, edit, etc. however, when i connect it with a pc, i can see the drive but i cannot see the content in the drive. what could be the problem with it? could i have deleted some of the files? is there any way i can do to fix this problem? thanks
have you checked those posts ? vapcmd
but since it's working you have the opportunity to save your files on your backup. then you can format it again on the pc and on your mac copy the files back onto that drive. there are thousands of prior discussions. bob
hi, there are 4 basic reasons external disk not detect 1. may be usb port damage 2. may be your system not support these 3. external device/data cable problem or 4. hardware and software problem
