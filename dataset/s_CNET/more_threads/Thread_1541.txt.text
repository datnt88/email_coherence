i'm hoping someone here can help me. i am using a d-link di-524 802.11g wireless/wired router. i have spent the past several days trying to get everything working properly and quickly. i have two computers that i want to connect wirelessly to the router. when i connect using wifi, i can generally maintain connection speeds of 54mbps. however, when i run speed tests (and i have run many, many of them) i only get between 1 and 2 mbps using wireless. when i plug my laptop directly into the router, i can get anywhere from 5-7 or so mbps. wireless transfers are even relatively slow when transfering files between my two computers. i have tried several different types and brands of routers and i have changed all of the settings that i know about. i've messed around with changing encryption levels and nothing really changes. i have also tried changing channels, but nothing seems to really speed things up. the fastest transfers i can ever get between my two systems run a little over 1 mb per sec, but it is usually around 300 k/sec or so, which is way too slow. any suggestions are greatly appreciated. thank you.
wired speed can be 100 megabit full duplex on a switched hub when maintains speed due to the switch. i'll leave you to learn why a switched hub matters. wifi might be 54 megabit half duplex and is on a shared airspace which can easily be interfered with. your numbers are quite normal and you need to learn about the technology you are using. i can't educate you about all this in this small space, but there are fine web contents that you can keep reading till it sinks in. bob
a wireless &quot;g&quot; environment, will result in the lower speed being obtained. a pure &quot;g&quot; network will yield better throughput.
