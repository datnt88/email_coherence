i just received an external cd writer from the us where the power used is 110v i live in india and here the power is 220v do i need to buy a transformer to work this device here or just an ordinary adapter would do? i don't want to damage either the device or my pc by not using the correct power connection
your choice on make and model. anything that will convert 220 to 110.
thank you.got a voltage convertor - input 330v-240v and output 110v-120v
