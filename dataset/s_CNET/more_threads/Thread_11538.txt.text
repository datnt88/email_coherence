i broke my usb belkin n adapter, metal cap went off after i stomp on it accidental(it fell off of my desk)and it may broke the chip, i heard i have the warranties since i brought this early 08 or 09(forgot) and broke it few day ago. will belken willing to replace it or am i sol and have to buy a new one. i don't know if they willing to replace it or not since i cant find the warranties information on their site, or how much it will cost? if anyone know or have inside info with belkin please post the information.
i email tech support for information and getting it next week for more information since they dont work on weekend.
now-a-day, i think it's cheaper to just buy another one. but i hope you get a free replacement from them. good luck.
products that become defective during a specific period of time but, unless accidents are specified as being covered, i suspect you're out of luck. my guess is that physical damage is considered as abuse or misuse and won't fall under warranty coverage.
