step 1 ? some coffee was spilled on the keyboard of this gateway solo 9500 notebook. the hard drive is good. ste 2? this gateway solo 9500 notebook; serial # : 0023713462 will not boot up. it boots to the bios screen and stops. the bios message is; &quot;to change bios settings, press &lt;f2&gt; to display system messages, press &lt;esc&gt; hitting f2 or esc has no effect nor movement. what steps would you recommend to trouble shoot this boot up problem? step 3? the gateway solo 9500 notebook has been dismantled, cleaned with alchohol. the keyboard has been replaced. the hard drive is good. if it boots to this bios screen, does that mean the mother board is ok? the ibm transtar 20 gig hd was removed in installed in a dell notebook. it booted up and the data was backed up. the ibm hard drive is good. here is the info on the bottom of the gateway - solo 9500 notebook; serial # : 0023713462 customer id: 26108087 serial no: bda111808997 part no: 3500845 specifications for the gateway solo 9500 notebook processor and core logic processor options one intel pentium iii cpu thanks from gary in new orleans
it means nothing else. if you can shop around (ebay) and where else, you might find a new board. and no, no one you know repairs motherboards. too expensive... in closing, i did not discuss you setting and saving the bios settings. i hope you tried that. bob
thanks for the reply. there is no way to change or save the bios settings. it only does one thing; boot up to the bios screen with the message. then no matter which key is pressed nothing happens. thanks.
