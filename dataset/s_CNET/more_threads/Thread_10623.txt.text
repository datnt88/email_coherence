hi, i've got a gateway desktop that i've upgraded the operating system to windows 7 64 bit. it worked fine for the past month and all of a sudden, it started turning itself off as if someone has pressed the off button. when i turn it back on, it asks me if i want to reboot in safe mode. i've recently tried installing a new printer but the same issue occurs when i have unplugged my printer. it does the same thing whether it's actively being used or being left unattended. i don't think it's an overheating issue because it's located in a relatively cold room. thanks
you still need to consider overheating at component level or a malfunctioning/stressed power supply.
don't guess, look. check the heat sink fan and cooling fins. i've seen them so clogged you couldn't see the fins.
i turned the machine back on this morning and it won't even boot now. it asks me to either start windows normally or restore. when i choose start windows normally, the window logos shows up and then it freezes. when i choose restore, it loads the file and when it's completed, it freezes. my guess is that it's probably a driver issue with the new drive updates that i recently installed. am i correct?
try &quot;last known good configuration&quot;.
try taking the case off...
did your problem occure when you installed the new drive updates? if so you might have damaged your hard drive. jerry
i've set the machine aside for the past few days and it boots again. i'm deleting the programs and drivers that i've installed recently and hopefully it won't turn itself off again.
