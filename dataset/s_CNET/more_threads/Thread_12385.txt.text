i have a couple of old computers at home and would like to turn them into servers for my friend's site,  where they are all cluster together (i think this is the right terminology), so if one computer fails, then the other one kicks in. this way the server will always be up. i just want to know if this is possible? also, if one computer is corrupted or becomes infected, will they all be infected as well (since they are clustered)? then what is the best way to back up my data? thank you
to do this right you need a load balancer. still that is only the network side. the servers themselves have to be able keep track of each others status and detect any failure. this gets very complex very fast since you have issue like open files and databases to deal with and that does not even start to think about open sessions to a end users that you would want to fail over. if you are good with linux you can most likely get most this done for free. if you do not have the skills you are better off paying a hosting company.
i suggest you not do this. donate the machines to him and let him configure and maintain them but to run a server for a friend is a good way to lose a friend. bob
