i currently have 3 usb 2.0 hard drives 2x fantom 500gb and a 200gb seagate in a vantec nexus enclosure. the hard drives all work fine when plugged directly into the computer but i recently purchased a vantec ugt-mh401 usb hub and when all the drives are plugged in they are painfully slow. for instance extracting a file with 7zip tops out at 400kb /s. is this the case with every hub i could purchase or is it a problem with this particular hub. it advertises that it has &quot;downstream ports have automatic connect and speed detection function plus over-current protection with auto-recovery&quot; which i am not sure if that would be a problem this is the product page  on newegg. any help is appreciated. thanks
seen that. little to do but try another make and model. my fix at home was to add a 4 port usb 2.0 pci card. that was same or as much money as your hub. bob
thats what i was thinking i bought the hub to souley to clean up the appearance of the front of my case. also i got the hub because it is externally powered and doesn't suck power from my psu i am not sure if it matters since the hardrives are externally powered themselves though.
