i just replaced the cpu fan on my computer. i had to take the motherboard out to get to it because the screwdriver kept slipping (athlon xp a462). i put everything back together exactly how i found it. then, when i hit the power button my new fan starts spinning and everything sounds good but nothing show up on the monitor (says no signal). i know the monitor is good because it worked before i took everything apart. i have already reseated the ram, and cpu, and checked voltage on the cmos battery (3v). did i kill my motherboard? thanks, all help appreciated.
by the way my specs are: pc chips m825g athlon xp processor 1.67ghz
1. is the video cable plugged in? 2. any beeps? watch what happens to most athlon xp chips if you don't get the heatsink and compound right at
the video cable is plugged in and there are no beeps surprisingly.
-&gt; tell us about the heatsink compound. the video i shared showed how fast this cpu smokes if the heatsink isn't on proper. the big clue is &quot;no beeps.&quot; in closing type bad caps on google.com for another cause. bob
there was not much heatsink compound on the old fan. on the new one there was plenty already applied. i'll have to take a look at the caps later. thanks.
