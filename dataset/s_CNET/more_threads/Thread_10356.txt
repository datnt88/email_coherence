(router is across the street in my office). my download speed (measured 300 feet away in my residence is down 26.6 mbps and up is 2.6 mbps. great signal and noise readings. the problem only occurs when streaming through the tv or blu ray at hd. anything less is fine. streaming same movie to laptop is fine (however laptop needs better video hardware as stutters occur). fix for router or new router suggesions would be appreciated. if new, the router needs to have external antennae so i can hook up to outdoor yagis.

(could be reason ebay seller unloaded the router) external antenna ---- yep i agree--i was hoping to not have to add a repeater/extender/bridge. the increase of complexity of the wifi network something i wish to avoid. aggravation=blood pressure issues. i've done to research on new routers looking for something with higher cpu speeds, strong radio, and more memory. what it comes down to is they are out there but not without firmware issues out of the box. i've also heard success stories and failure in flashing dd-wrt etc. with my limited geekyness (a word?) , i am a 59 year old farmer, i would like to keep it fairly simple. pperhaps my expectations of simple are too elevated?? a gentle nudge toward a functional kiss router probably ?
