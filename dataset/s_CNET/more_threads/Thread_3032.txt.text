i have a router and two pcs on it. one (ethernet connected to the router) has a printer and i want to share it with the other pc. i set up the printer as shared then i went to the other pc (wireless connection to the router) and tried to define a remote printer. the printer add wizard cannot find the printer: i tried browsing and it found nothing; i tried telling it the printer was \\pcname\printername and it couldn't find it either what am i missing? both machines are running winxp home john
when browsing for it try typing the following into explorer: \\ip address of pc with printer share\printer share name ie: \\192.168.1.50\hplsjet if it finds it, click on it and connect.
browse the network for the pc that hosts the printer. click on it and see if the printer shows. it should if the sharing was set up properly. do a right click and select &quot;connect&quot;. i remember years ago older nt systems had an &quot;install&quot; option from this point but not sure if this works the same. the ideal way is to use a print server but this costs a bit and not all printers and print servers work happily together.
i once had a similar problem. the issue was not with the physical set-up but with the firewall software (e.g., norton security, black ice, etc.) i had installed on the machines. if you're running one of these programs, you should go into the scren that allows you to allow or add &quot;friendly&quot; ip addresses. just type in the ip address of your printer (e.g., 192.168.1.100) and hopefully you'll set up program will now be able to &quot;see&quot; the networked printer. good luck...
the_ehrl makes a very good point. i don't know how many network problems i've pulled hair out trying to solve, only to track it back to a simple firewall block. enough at least that now, the firewall is the frist place i look when a network problem rears it's ugly head.
