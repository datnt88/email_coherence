hi, my old powerbook g3 won't start, there's not even that familiar start-up sound, just a tiny tiny zzzzzzz from inside. sometimes not even that. on recommendation, i did buy a new battery and also tried to reset the computer, which didn't help at all. since that, i bought a new ibook, but it's a shame that my favorite computer, that used to be a very good computer, just is gathering dust in my cupboard. any ideas what could be wrong with my old friend? /jimmy a
it's a powerbook g3 with firewire and osx 10.1 /j
the tiny zzzzz sond from inside does not sound too good. it's possibly the powerboard that is the culprit here or even the pmu board. i if resetting the pmu via the keyboard or the reset button failed to do the trick, try this. remove the battery, plug in the power adapter, reset the pmu and try to fire it up. if you still get the zzzz sound, i fear you may have to accept that your old friend has departed but could be resurrected for a, quite large, chunk of change. p
ok, i tried it. do not get any sound at all, just this tiny zzz sound, which is so tiny that i might be imagining it. perhaps i shoud try to sell it as spare parts. its organs might make someone elses pb live longer. thanks! /j
