winxp pro 2002 sp3. i installed new samsung 502ij hd two partitions. bios recognizes as 502mb but windows as 912mb, second partition as unformatted even if it was formatted and some data poured in.please help
but you said bios shows 502mb and windows as 912mb. is this just a typo or what you see? if you created 2 partitions, you should see 2 different drive letters. is that the case? if you have more than one partition, your bios is still only going to report the hd full size and not that of the partitions windows sees. perhaps you did create a 912mb partition on the 502gb drive.
bios shows 502gb but winxp disk manager shows four partitions h:155gb(works ok) g:421gb (i transferred about 120gb but now shows unformatted by my computer - and here lays the problem) and two more partitions without letters the first 310gb(free space adnotated by windows) and a last partition no letter 1.99 gb. the issue i cna't format g: because i shall loose the data. thank you so much for your answer!!!
but you know that. it comes to almost 700gb on a drive with a model # that shows it as 500gb. instead of using explorer, look at what disk management says. it will list by partition with drive letter and also show a crude map of your physical drives. that map will contain partition information for each drive and will also show any unallocated space.
hi steve, the disk i bought was a used one and badly formatted (i wasn't told). i recovered all my files ( i found a lot of others not mine either) and got free a new hd who works fine. thank you for your help!!!
