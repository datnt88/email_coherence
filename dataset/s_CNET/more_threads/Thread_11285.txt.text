i have been reading ways of setting up a 2 router network, and could use some help. what i am trying to do for a small local business is this: dsl internet, in the house, pc in shop (40 to 50 feet away), and wireless access while in the shop. what i was thinking of doing is taking a router from the house (that connects to the dsl modem and from router to pc) to the garage where a router would be set up as a switch with wireless capabilities. i need the pcs to have file sharing. i would love to see diagrams if anyone has links to them. thanks tc
my wpnt834 connects 2 houses away at over 200 feet. maybe you can try yours? bob
if might, but my experience with a wrt54g linksys router i have trouble connecting to my livingroom 20 feet away. maybe it is the pci wireless card i have connected. what hardware do you suggest.
with files sharing, the wireless might be slow. the small business is in a country setting, and i and iffy on broadcasting unsecure, open wireless. how can he keep track of who is using the wifi without too much trouble.
i have this setup. cable modem -&gt; wpnt834 (w/wifi) -&gt; buffalo whr-hp-g54 (with white russian webif firmware). the &quot;-&gt;&quot; are ethernet cables. nothing special in the settings. bob
the hard wire goes to the lan or the wan connection of the r2? from what i read it goes in he lan 1 or r2. will the router be able to turn the internet connection into wifi? so if i had a cable modem -&gt;r1 -&gt;pc and -&gt;r2 lan1, and able to wifi and hardwire from it like a switch.
cable modem to wan of first router the the wan of the second router goes to one of the lan ports of first ports. nothing special as to settings. besides my usual settings of ssid broadcasting, wpa there isn't a thing i changed. bob
