when i turn this computer one it just does one long beep over and over and over i was wondering what this ment? it wont boot up at all.
look here.
is that the bios has notified you of a fatal hardware error. this could be ram, processor or video. it could just be a poor connection such as an unseated component. agp video cards are notorious for this because of the construction of the card edge and mb slot. they tend to creep with pressure from tightening screws and the cable. such is probably why newer versions are locked in place. take everything apart and reseat it. try disconnecting what is not vital and try again. this might help to disclose a weak power supply. good luck.
ok well we tryed pulling stuff out like 1 think then another and the only time it dident do the long beep is when the processor was out of it. i'm guessing that means the processer is broke?
