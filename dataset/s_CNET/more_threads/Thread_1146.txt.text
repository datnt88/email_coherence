i have been trying to find the binary file for an old soyo bios - 5eh-1bc1.bin - no luck, even from the 'obsolete' section on the soyo website! my old pc is working fine, but won't recognise hard drives over 40gb. so i've a choice between using a smaller (second user) drive, or buying a new motherboard. any other suggestions? hope the question's clear enough; i'm new round here cheers, sj
you are in the timeframe that you shouldn't touch such a machine in case it just falls apart underneath you. my advice is to get the 40g and get by. bob
are you saying it won't recongize a 40gb partition or a physical hd 40gb size. its important, as then you could partition a large hd into smaller partitions under 40gb, probably 32gb as the limit for each partition. did you visit the hd makers website for hd install s/w to help install beyond whatever the bios limits are? good luck -----willy
if the bios only sees 40gb, partitioning won't make any difference. most hds come with overlay software which would enable your system to see all the space.
or you might try something like this.
