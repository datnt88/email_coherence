i cannot seem to format my flash drive.
the necessary details in your post to give any sensible answer. kees
i use windows xp. i have saved, sent to, and copied numerous files from my zip drive,and c drive to my flash drive. i have lots of space left on the flash, approximately 90%; however, when i attempt to copy or send addditional files to the flash i get a error message which does not let me send additional files to it. i.e.cannot recognize file&quot; i don't have this problems when copying files between other drives. please help.
the top level directory does have limits. tell me how many files you have in the top directory.
please clarify what is meant by the term &quot;top directory&quot;. i simply attempt to send the files to the designated drive for the flash. i have not set up any directories on the drive. are you suggesting i create directories and then send my files to them as appropriate? thanks. i am rather new at this.
&quot;i have not set up any directories on the drive. are you suggesting i create directories and then send my files to them as appropriate?&quot; yup.
thanks. i will set up directories within my zip drive and attempt to save files to them.
