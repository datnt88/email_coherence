i have taken a hard drive out of my laptop and connected to cable which had a usb plug. i have connected it to a desktop and it tells me it has discovered new hardware but it does not show up in my computer as a drive. when i unplug the cable it shows up as a drive but disappears immediately. what is up with this and how can i tell if there is anything on this drive to retrieve?
what does disk management tell you about the drive? to turn up into my computer it needs to have a ntfs or fat32 formatted partition. does it? kees
what drive? what adapter? which usb port? (front, rear) where in windows did you look? (device manager?) and why did you do this? bob
i have a similar problem with the seagate drive showing n evice manager but not in disc management. any help greatfully received. robin
that makes bob and me ask the same questions. waiting for your answers. also, is it a seagate drive coming from your laptop? or is the history of this drive different? then it's not a similar problem, but a different problem. kees
