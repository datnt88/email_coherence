hey everyone..new here, but i need some good speakers recommended for my home office computer setup...i play my xm radio off the computer speakers a lot, plus also have small tv with directv set up on it and would like to play the directv sound throw the pc speakers as well...can someone please recomend some good speakers...2.1 or 5.1 which would be best for me? also wireless speakers a good option? if i went 5.1 i would have to have wireless pretty much..thanks
i think bose sound the best for me. go give it a listen. that's the best way.
