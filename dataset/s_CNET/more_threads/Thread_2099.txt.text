i have a basic question. my dell 580 has an integrated nic card. does this give me the capability to acces the web or do i still need a wireless card?
did you connect to your network or lan with the usual ethernet cable?
i have comcast &quot;triple play&quot; using an arris cable router/modem. the arris is connected by a &quot;plug link&quot; to an electrical socket. two computers connect to the lan via plug links. my main computer is separated from the arris by about 75 feet with a lot of walls in between resulting in a very erratic internet connection. i just purchased a netgear range extender with the thought that i would connect wirelessly (like my laptops) from the arris. this is why i'm asking if the nic is wireless capable. this question is really academic because the range extender doesn't seem to extend range. i used my laptop to test the signal and, of course, it connects easily within 30-50 feet of the arris. however the laptop doesn't appear to be getting any signal from the range extender as the signal degrades immediatly adjacent to the extender. my thoughts now are to purchase a second cable modem and place it close to the main computer and connect it by ethernet. i don't know if this will work with two modems working off the same comcast cable signal. i am not a &quot;techy&quot; so would appreciate any thoughts.
my arris is not a router. if i connected one machine, the other would not work. so far, a nic is not wireless. i can however use a nic to connect wirelessly if i use an ethernet cable to what might be called a bridge. sorry but it looks like you are asking me to give a course in networking. that i will have to decline but will answer the stumpers. bob
thanks
