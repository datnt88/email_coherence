(it is not the video card or monitor) thanks in advanced

(such as the processor)&quot;	the amd would self-destruct if the heat sink is left off. you omitted the results of the cardboard test and the wattage of the power supply. for that list, the usual 450 watt psu is fitted. bob

15004	6	3258	38502	38493	r. proffitt	11/18/03 5:19 am	1.06913274e12	an article and video about the cpu heat issue.	great way to show the issue. bob
