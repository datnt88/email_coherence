could i have a recomended board to use with a my 830 or 840. would like to go cheap so unless you provide a solid case why to go with 955 ill probably want to stick with the 955 but whick mother board do i go with?
dont know how cheap you want to go. well, when i was looking for the motherboards i ran across on a web-site that i dont have in front of me stating whats a good mb's for intel. they said that these 2 mb's are pretty good if you want to overclock your pc. abit lg-81 socket t (lga 775) intel 945g micro atx intel motherboard-119.00 msi 945p neo-f socket t (lga 775) intel 945p atx intel motherboard-123.00 both support intel d
you go cheap, you get cheap. not to say that abit and the other aren't good boards, but when you get to dual-core you want something that has the best chipsets as well. that's why i use asus. check them out. they have the largest selection i've seen yet. and life goes on... jack
