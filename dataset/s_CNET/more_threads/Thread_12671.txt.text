my computer is not recognizing my usb external hard drive. i get the error message that the usb device is not recognized. &quot;one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and windows does not recognize it.&quot; i don't know what to do, i've tried unplugging all usb devices, then plugging only the hard drive in, i've tried leaving everything unplugged for the night, and i even tried a system restore. i'm running vista ultimate 32bit on a hp dv6500t intel core 2 due 2.0ghz 2gb ram the hard drive is a western digital my book premium es edtion
i have also tried it in multiple usb ports and same problem. i have a powered usb hub and tried it in all four of those, so 7 ports and nothing. all my other usb devices work in these ports.
be sure that the power was removed from said drive and you tried a shiny good as you know usb 2.0 cable. also you have to try it on another pc. bob
on another computer, and i got the same message. so i'm going to try to get another cable and leave the drive unplugged for awhile.
i tried your suggestion of unplugging it and trying a different cable. i left it unplugged for about 30 minutes and borrowed the cable from my hp printer, plugged it all back in turned it on and then plugged it into my computer. one last hurrah and it worked. thank you so much for the help, otherwise i would've had a $150 paperweight, thanks again- nick
i'd retire that cable...
