i want to stream media from my computer tower (located directly next to my television) to my hdtv. the problem is this...i am currently running dual monitors and the 2 slots that come out of the back of my graphics card are taken up (one slot for each monitor). i used to have an hd cable running from my tower to my tv when i ran one monitor...but i don't want to sacrifice dual monitor viewing. is there another option, for instance is there some sort of 2 to 1 adapter i can plug into one of the tower slots that will allow a monitor plug in as well as a tower to tv cable? basically, the two slots that are hd capable in the back of my computer tower are occupied and i don't want to sacrifice dual-monitors. how can i run hd from my tower to hdtv to have my tv show whatever is on the computer monitor? i currently have win xp but this shouldnt matter thanks.
why not a hdmi splitter? well under 99 bucks on amazon.com bob
hdmi splitter? i was thinking more along the lines of a &quot;switch&quot; like this  any thoughts?
your words made me think you wanted to duplicate the displays not switch. bob
