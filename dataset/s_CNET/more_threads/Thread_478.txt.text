just a simple question. i am going finally do a long needed memory upgrade. i currently have 128mb. i know doubling would be suitable so what is best...get a single 256mb module, or can i slap another 128 module in the other slot?
some motherboards can't use generic 256mb sticks. what works fairly well is to get another stick of what you have if you can't identify the machine or if some homebrew, the make/model of the motherboard. bob
it's an older gateway that i have access to all of the info on-line, but if it's easier to just get the same thing that is fine. thanks.
most intel bx chipset based systems can't use the low cost generic sticks. it's too bad you didn't reveal the make and model number since such may not be one of the bx or i8xx chipsets that i know to proceed with care. easy out? use crucial at  bob
