i recently aquired a dell demension 8100 1.3mhz p4.when i opened it up and found there was no memory installed and after futher examiation noticed it used rdram.now this pc will be used for everyday computing and the sims 2 game.my question is how much rdram should i install it this pc?i dont want to drop a whole lot of cash in this thing i jsut want it to run smoothly.
if windows 2000, maybe 256mb will do, but xp i'd have 512m as the minimum. fyi, the reason the poor machine was abandoned is likely due to what happened when the former owner learned about the cost of rdram. be sure to get pairs or the rdram since... it's installed in pairs. bob
rdram must be brought in &quot;pairs&quot; if you didn't know. you probably have 4-slots of ram, but being pairs, you quickly fill half of that. dell, orginally shipped that system with 128mb -or- 256mb as rdram was expensive and still is. for all practical reasons, 256mb is a real must but 512mb is just dandy. cost for 1gb of rdram maybe too high, but ebay should have some reasonable vendors. for the cost of rdram alone, you maybe better off buying a cheap entrylevel new system like emmachine or compaq, that's pretty close to similar amounts of $. tada -----willy
