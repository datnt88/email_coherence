9430	0	61819	733046	nr	shylaugh	2/1/05 6:46 pm	1.10728356e12	to all who complained about dell teck support	i just wanted to mention that i was so upset about the teck support at dell i wrote a letter on 1/20/05 and i received a call from the head office today. he was very nice and i told him there were many many customers who are unhapply about the support. he said he wished more people let him know about a problem with the support so they know where they stand. i am only posting this to suggest that anyone who has had problems write a letter so they are aware of how many customers are/were dissatisfied. sandra

(my payments always seem to be late, even though i mail them way in advance.) so today i am writing my letter and asking that they contact me in writing in the future. once they receive my letter, if they again call me at work i will have a legal case against their harassment. would you mind sharing the address where you sent your letter? they have so many addresses, i don't know where to send it. thanks much! stephanie

9430	6	61819	1104394	733046	culture_of_one	4/6/05 12:45 pm	1.1127915e12	ignorance is bliss...	i find it very hard to believe that anyone could &quot;not know&quot; how bad things are...however i do believe that writing directly to the company can help. since most disatisfied consumers don't take the time to complain in writing, each letter counts for a lot more than just one complaint. (in government they usually count &quot;10,000 complaints&quot; per letter, since they are assuming that only one in ten-thousand will complain in writing.) i fully agree that &quot;any company&quot; which provides crappy service should &quot;hear&quot; about it. call, write letters, send email, write posts in various forums, lodge formal complaints...and keep it up until they either do the right thing or go out of business from lost sales due to loss of reputation. sincerely, jdm

9430	8	61819	1106311	1104827	culture_of_one	4/7/05 8:04 am	1.11286104e12	i'd like to say...	that &quot;i'm canadian, and proud!&quot;...but that would be a fib, john! however, as far as i know, that is how they count letters up here (at least at the federal level). it's also the way they count letters in several state and federal departments. (i thought &quot;civics&quot; was a required subject when you went to school...) i don't believe there are any hard and fast rules as to how many &quot;points&quot; each letter counts for (10,000 seems to be a &quot;standard&quot; number)...but they do count for a lot more than one letter. and, as i've said, it depends on the department and/or organization. personally, i believe there are certain segments of government that wouldn't care how many letters we wrote. (you weren't by any chance a postman...were you, john?)
