is there a command line inquiry that i can run that will display the ip address of all the active pcs on my local lan? thanks, jim
go to the command prompt and type nbtstat /? to get the command that you want.
.
thanks &quot;nbtstat&quot; gave exactly the result i was looking for. jim
ping the network mask number once and you get a reply from all on that lan. neat trick. bo
