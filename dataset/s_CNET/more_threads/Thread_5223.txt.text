we are likely to buy an lcd flat screen monitor but i don't know if here is anything to look out for regarding connections. we have an old dell dimension 4500. will any lcd monitor to be compatible and have the correct leads/connections?
may require video upgrade, can depend on monitor parameters.
you go everything already.
