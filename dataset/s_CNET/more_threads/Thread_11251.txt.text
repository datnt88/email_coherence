my alignment was off on my printer, so i went through the the &quot;print head alignment&quot; under properties, and it fixed the alignment, but now it's printing the colors way off. can anyone help please! christine
hi christine, i used to have one of those and the only way i could get it to behave was to delete it entirely,assuming of course you still have the install disc.if not,i would suggest you logon to epson's site and download and burn the relevant drivers to a cd.then you can go ahead safely. ps. you may not find the exact drivers you are looking for but i know the 850 ordinary is there. good luck, worzlegummage.
i went into the preferences and hit &quot;deep clean&quot; and it fixed it.... thank goodness! thank you for responding. christine
