a very petite lady friend of mine (4' 10&quot;) is studying to be a medical transcriptionist, but is finding that conventional keyboards require her fingers to stray from the home position a lot. this prevents her getting up to speed and might well lead to repetitive stress injuries down the road, i'm told. is there a keyboard available that isn't a toy that is made for smaller-than-average persons? it would need to be pretty much a standard keyboard, but with reduced key size and/or spacing - number pad optional. i'm presently looking at the 83-key low profile mini keyboard sold by ergonomic resources, but i don't know who actually makes it. can someone give us advice? thanks!
there are many chinese manufacturers out there. just asking if this is required to buy the keyboard. i use a few 83 key mini keyboards for servers and at booths to save space. after picking up one i found more for 20 bucks at game sellers. it's the one they sell for the ps2 that connects with usb. while they don't tell you it works with a pc, it does and at under 20 bucks not a big investment. bob
i'm not a gamer, so i've never heard of this. is it a brand name/model? chinese characters aren't required here, just plain old european. is this sort of thing available at circuit city, compusa and the like? thanks - terry
you asked for the maker and that's what's on one here. the keyboard has english key tops. the unit may have been boxed as a ps2 usb keyboard which had some other name such as kingmax on it. all this confuses the issues here since it's a generic product with many suppliers and in many packages. let me ask if the maker is a needed piece of information to purchase such a keyboard? i picked these up at ebgames, best buy but don't venture to circuit city so i can't answer that. bob
