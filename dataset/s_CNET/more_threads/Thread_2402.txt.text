i am moving into an apt building and need a decent wireless usb card to piggy back on signals...should i get a mimo? n? or rangsmax? or linksys n? thanx...i am looking for range and signal.thanx
look at this homebrew unit (link).  there are more examples like this but it could be done with some artistic flair for a better look. bob
i am asking about getting a usb wireless network card that will interface with most networks(g/b/n) and pickup as many signals as possible on its own 1st... i am thinking netgear rangemax next model...or wpn111 or linksys new 300 n unit? any opinions?
