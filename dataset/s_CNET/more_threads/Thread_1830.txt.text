game wise. and what are the good cards?
you won't hear the difference between the usual audio on the usual motherboards in the usual gaming pc's and a specialised card with the usual head phones or the usual computer speakers. if you don't believe me, just do a double-bind test. kees
in fact i find most owners blow up at the support or seller of such things over the install and setup. there is so little payoff that i never suggest such. however if you sell such or make them you would call them indispensable. bob
creative makes a whole line of cards, internal and external. if surround or 5.1 is what you want, onboard won't go beyond surround and that takes some config changes to work right and utilize a line in jack as a surround channel output. a good little powered speakers setup with a built in subwoofer can replace headphones, the little units mounted to or built into a chair with the sw bolted to a wooden chair frame can really put you in the middle of the action.
