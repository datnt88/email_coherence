6556	3	251866	2512735	2512729	r. proffitt	6/12/07 5:30 pm	1.1816694e12	from the story, no.	partition resizing, even with pm is never a sure thing so everyone usually tells everyone to backup. since it sounds like you must start over why not just partition from the getgo? bob
6556	4	251866	2512783	2512735	ultrarob	6/12/07 7:04 pm	1.18167504e12	i know what i'm doing this weekend	well i'm thinking linux probably isn't worth the trouble anyway, so i'll just figure out what to do with my hp recovery partition (didn't shell out extra for actual vista install disks) and start over. i'm not trying to insult you, but just to make sure, you do understand that the partition in question, the windows partition, is completely usable, in fact i'm on it right now, but windows doesn't recognize its size correctly?
6556	5	251866	2513009	2512783	r. proffitt	6/13/07 7:09 am	1.18171854e12	sorry, i didn't know that.	i reread your post, looked at the picture and can't see why i'd repair this. -&gt; let's be clear about what you want to do here. if it's working, why fix this? if you want to add that 5.12gb to the &quot;winblows&quot; partition, i think only a few simple steps might be needed. now i have to repeat the &quot;backup first&quot; everytime we write about such things but my thoughts are this. 1. in disk management, delete the 5.12gb parition. (maybe the other one too?) 2. we want to have unallocated space. i can't explain why so many times people can't or won't do this step. they continually make a partition rather than leaving it unallocated. now we might be ready for gparted to grow the winblows partition. you would also be ready for a nearly painless install of most linux distros. bob

6556	11	251866	2515693	2515691	r. proffitt	6/16/07 4:20 am	1.1819676e12	sorry...	i meant dust off the areas between winblows and the hp recovery partition. what i do is to do all the shrinking and growing first. then when that's all settled down i create the new partitions for linux. many try to do it all at one time, but i don't. i can only guess that i'm dodging the bullet. bob

6556	13	251866	2530340	2530168	ultrarob	7/3/07 5:09 am	1.18343934e12	the problem fixed itself	trying it again, it worked, and everything went back to normal, despite the fact that it failed before resizing the filesystem. i'm not sure how that works, but whatever...
