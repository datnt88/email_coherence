on a desktop, which would be better for mainstream use with a little bit of gaming, (call of duty), a intel pentium 4 630 with 1 gig ram and an ati 256 mb x600 radeon or an amd 64 3500+ with 1 gig ram and a nvidia 256 mb 6800/ with turbo cache
i would have to say neither since it seems like you're purchasing from oem
whether its a good deal or not
and pair it with a geforce 6600gt. if you can cover the cost get an athlon 64 x2 3800+ dualcore cpu but the 3500+ looks like the sweet spot for the singlecore models.
dell, or hp. both same price
