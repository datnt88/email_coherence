i have a laptop with a mobile intel(r) 915gm/gms embedded graphics card, and i just installed more ram to the system, so i'd like to allocate more memory to the graphics card. i read the specs from intel so i know its possible, but they failed to explain how one goes about doing it. anyone have some ideas? (i checked the bios too... no luck there)
the setting varies with the machine in question. bob
but it has windows xp and an ami bios. 2ghz centrino 1gb ddr ram
without make and model i can't offer any sure answer. bob
