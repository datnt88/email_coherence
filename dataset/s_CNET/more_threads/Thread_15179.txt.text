says ink system failed .unable to copy,print ,fax .error0xc18a0106 then refuses to print after i refilled the black ink cartridge need a way around it . my printer is being held hostage by hp
all these printers need such things today.
i suppose i could buy a new cartridge although i am happy with the printers performance i would not have purchased it had i known hp dosnt recycle their ink cartridges. i have a problem being left no option as to what i buy and from who. especialy after the fact.
they grind them up and reuse the plastics and such. i wonder if you were trying to refill a cart. the reason why that fails is widely known but if you didn't know, you will soon. bob
someone checked out their recycling plan a while back ad t6hey found all the returned carts in the everyday trash in the pacages they were mailed back in. maybe they changed their practice since then ,i hope so.i dont get the attitude,and why ? i'm just a poor slob trying to gt by in life without getting burned especialy by some huge corperation that in practice does the same thing as i do but worse they sell a product designed to rip off their customers .but like u said now i wait for the hand of doom to fall all becauce of the wrong ink . thanx for trying to help really rj
explore the printers from kodak?
