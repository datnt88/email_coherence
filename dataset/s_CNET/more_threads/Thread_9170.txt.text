on a dell dimension 8100, with windows me, whenever the computer is booted, the mouse and keyboard work to enter the password, but as soon as the desktop appears, they both freeze up. then the only way to shut down is by the button on the front of tower. have tried mouse and keyboard on another computer and they work. would appreciate help.
did you do the work you see at  but this does not really answer your question. to diagnose this, we would have to get the machine into the shop and for a few thousand would write a failure report. bob
so is the owner.....the keyboard is clean, and i checked the mouse, and cleaned it. i opened the cover and checked all the connections and the inside was clean. the computer belongs to a 95yr oldfriend who likes the old computer better than the new one she has, because the card making program she's used to, is not compatable with the newer one, she just don't want to have to get used to a new compuer. it was not coming on at all, and a computer expert told her the hard drive was gone. i brought it home and got it to boot as far as the desktop....
as i see old machines i listen to them then i proceed to clean the machine even if it looks clean as well as ... 1. replace all heatsink compounds. 2. inspect for bad caps. yes the hard drive could be gone but drives are cheap so i would be slipping in a new one to reload the os and re-test. bob
