hi colleagues, i just procured and installed nanostation m5 wireless ap, but noticed that introducing this device into my network (lan) brings it down, thereby denying users of internet services. could there be a compatibility problem here? please help me out.
since it doesn't work and they don't offer support, return it for something else. i use routers as waps but a wireless wap is usually best if from the same maker of your router. bob
many thanks for your response.
