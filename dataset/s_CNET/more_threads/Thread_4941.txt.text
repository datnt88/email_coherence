i'm using xp, sp2 desktop and have been experiencing usb port malfunction. whenever any usb device is inserted in any of the six usb ports available then the system immediately hangs and if a usb device was inserted prior starting of pc then system does not boot and hangs prior starting windows.
when the motherboard drivers are not installed this happened on many motherboards. can you share the make and model of the machine? bob
i'm using compaq presario, model- sr1705il
try to install said drivers from hp.com?
