hi, i have a dell dimension e520 with a intel celeron 2.8ghz processor and 1gb of ram, and i want to upgrade it to be able to play blu-ray on it and since my processor isn't fast enought to play blu-ray, i want to upgrade my graphics from intel intergated graphics so, that the graphics card will do all the encoding, so that it doesn't require the processor to encode it. i am looking for a good graphics card that will do the encoding without using the processor that is under $200 and will work on my dell dimension e520 without having to replace the power supply. thanks dell dimension e520 intel celeron d 2.8ghz 1gb of ram windows vista 32-bit 305walt power supply
wouldn't a ps3 connected to your display cost less and work well?
$77 radeon hd 4650 no video card off-loads *all* encrypted blu-ray decoding so your cpu will still be used some. you might want to consider adding this [url= pentium d 915, 2.8ghz dual core cpu[/core].
