alright, my brother just gave me an old asus desktop. whenever i try to power it on, it starts beeping, and doesn't start. how can i find out what the problem is?
on beep codes.
like wayne suggests, search for the beep codes for that particular model #. the beeps are telling you the nature of the problem. once you understand the codes, you'll be on your way to repairing the machine.
