my brother-in-law is getting dsl installed. his dell computer doesn't have a nic card and instead of hooking it up usb i was going to install a nic that i have. the question is, the dell site says that it uses a 120 pin nic card. the ones i have are all 116 pin. the people i have talked to, say they have never heard of the 120 pin. is that just a type o or does dell have special card they use?. thanks wayne
mystery! bob
the dell 4500s is a desktop. it is one of those small things that opens like a clam shell. i know it only has two pci slots. sorry i left that out. wayne
shows it will accept a standard pci network card. bob
that is what i was looking for. i was just confused about the 120 pin and the 116 pin. thanks again wayne
just a wee bit more information was needed for me to reply. my first hit found laptops and that desktop. bob
i installed the linksys nic card i had in his computer and is working fine. thank you wayne
