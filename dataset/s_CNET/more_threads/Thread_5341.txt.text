i bought myself a 1 gb stick of ram for an old tower i had been using, but it has since died (i'm hoping the ram stick didn't have anything to do with it...). i believe the ram is ddr 1. so i'm wondering, if i go and buy myself a new 3 gb equipped computer that uses ddr3 and i put the old stick in one of it's spare slots... will that helpmate computer in any way? or would it just hinder it?
i think the technical term for what i'm asking is backwards compatibility.
*will that help the computer*
you cannot put a ddr1 ram in a ddr3 socket. it won't fit.
lol, thanks for the swift response to my query.
