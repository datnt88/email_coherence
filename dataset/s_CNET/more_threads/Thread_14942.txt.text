i have a 10 gig hd not in the computer, which i would like to get the music off of and clear everything else off of it and put it into a new built computer sometime later. is there a cable i can purchase to connect the hard drive to a usb port to download the music files into another hard drive, and wipe the hard drive clean for use in another machine. thanks for any help.
1. buy an usb 'hard disc enclosure' to put your hard disk in. that's the &quot;cable&quot; you mention. 2. mount this disk as a slave in any other computer. no need to buy anything. your choice. kees
you can find quite a few enclosures on newegg for less than $20.
thanks for the 2 great ideas. i really appreciate the help.good day all... wattash.
