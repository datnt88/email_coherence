hi, recently i turned on my pc and found that it wont read the zip disk it had inserted. i tried to put another blank zip disk and still no recognition of having a disk inserted. i was told it may be because its dirty. i was told to get a zip cleaning disk, but so far i havent seen one for sale. could you guys help me on this one? by the way i got a pc with windows me. thanks for any help provided
the zip drive's head never makes contact with the media. it flies above the media so cleaning is not the issue. try that media in another drive. here's why. most zip drives are approaching or have passed their designed lifespan. bob
thanks for the advise. do u know if there is an new drive available that would read those disk?
we used dozens and dozens at the office so when we suspect one, we tried the media on another drive in the office. have a friend with a zip test the media for you. if need be, decide to move off the zip. bob
thanks for the advice, guess i will try to move my data off the disk and look for a new media. guess its time to get a cd burner
