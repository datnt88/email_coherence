hi, i just received my new ph and wanted to add an 80gb hdd to it. my question concerns the drive, i got it at a yard sale, and was wondering if there was a way to make sure that it didn't contain viruses. will formatting it in the ph erase any potentially harmful material or do i risk infecting just by hooking it up? thanks.
format removes all threats and all data.
get a program called killdisk. it will wipe the hard drive clean. formatting wont
will destroy all data. recoverable? maybe. but who would want to recover a virus? to remove potentially dangerous data and install an os, formatting is all that is needed.
thanks for the info.
he bought a hard drive at a yard sale. i think that warrants completely destroying everything on it
i think i will try this just to make sure b/c, as you said, i did purchase these at a sale. $15 for 2 80 gb sata's.
