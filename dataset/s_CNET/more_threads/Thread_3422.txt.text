looking to buy a tablet pretty soon here. any recommendations on brand or model. i'm looking for something mainly for business use that's reliable and fast.
and different businesses have different needs. the only business use i've seen: colleagues using their ipad to read their mail and make short notes during meetings. they like that it is lighter than a laptop. kees
we looked at many tablets and really the only three we would consider would be- asus transformer apple ipad2 samsung galaxy tab 10.1 all three are very fast. the two different operating systems both have their pros and their cons, so really neither is a better choice, other than which one you prefer. those three should give you a very good starting point.
that's got to be the one, the ipad by apple. bob
