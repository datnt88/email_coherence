hi there, i have a issue with my new pc. i have install 64 bit windows 7 but it did not detect my 2*4 gb g.skill ram[instead it only use 4 gb of it].
when i recently upgraded my laptop from 2 x 2 gb to 2 x 4 gb, it didn't detect either one. i went back and noticed that i hadn't pushed the little suckers in all the way (even though i thought i had), so i pushed them in with more force (more than i had expected) and rebooted. it could be that one of your might have the same problem. if that's not it, i've read that sometimes there's a bios setting you have to tweak, although i've never personally seen it. since you say it's a new computer, i don't suppose there's a 4 gb hardware limit, but i'd check that just to be sure. good luck.
we cover a lot of ground including a setting that limits the os to 4gb as well as using the bios to see what the pc sees before windows starts. what does the bios show? and before you answer, windows will never show more than what the bios shows. bob
you upgrading ? have you tested both dimms in the same slot ? could be a defective dimm or a defective dimm slot more info needed for more help. vapcmd
