so i've been going around the internet for a couple hours now trying to find some decent ram that's compatible with my motherboard (asus m4a77td) what i'm looking for is something along the lines of 8-12gb 1600mhz ddr3 $60-$80 i have 4 slots available to use. i just picked up 12gb of corsair vengeance ram only to find out that it won't work with what i have. the other problem is that i've found a few items that do work with my asus but are all out of stock at tigerdirect, newegg, etc.
strange value. how did you arrive at that? it seems all the ddr3 memory stick comes in 2/4gb each...and the board have 4 sockets. did you happen to get some 3gb ram or some spares that you want to use. the prices are so reasonable, i probably would not want to mix them. take a look at mwave or fry's.
pick one.
thanks bob. i'm guessing this is decent ram at the least. ahtoi- the stock ram was 2 2gb sticks while the corsair was 3 4gb sticks.
