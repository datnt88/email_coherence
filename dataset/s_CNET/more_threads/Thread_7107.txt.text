i have a asus motherboard m2n-x-plus,amd athlon 64 2.6 ghz,ati radeon hd 3450 512 mb graphic memory,nvidia chipset,2 gb ram,160 gb hd,windows vista ultimate a i downloaded a everest ultimate which shows mcp 82 celsius or 180 farenheits is that a error in a program or it should be in that way all other temperatures is normal or problem is in hardware? please answer please thanks
and the case fans ? are they free of dust ? what does the mcp 82 refer to ? if that's video . . . try gpu-z. vapcmd
yes all fans working on gpu have not fan but gpu is stock without fan im installed an extra fan 120x120 mm
and expel hot air. said another way ... is it in a confined space like a cabinet or drawer ? please download and run siw, post the temps here. vapcmd
its on a table no hot air around it siw-tmpin0 107 f.tmpin1 89 f,core0 87 f,gpu core 42 and there is no mcp everest ultimate-motherboard 91 f,cpu 88 f,mcp 142 f with 120mm fan on case blowing full speed,aux 106 f,gpu diode 109 f
by the way...what's the approx room temp ? how many case fans do you have, what size are they 80mm, 92mm or 120mm ? where are they located and what direction are they moving the air ... pulling air into the pc or pushing it out of the case ? maybe a link to the product might make it easier...got one ? vapcmd
