after three monthsof using the new version of yahoo email i experience freezing several times a day. this version to me is still not bug-free! i am back using yahoo classic with no freezing. the last version of classic had more features than the one i am using now. could you please assist me in getting back the last version of classic before the new version of yahoo email became available. thanks. p.s. if i could transfer all my stored emails i would transfer them to google gmail. any comments please.
i think this is web mail which is, well, what it is. in parting, check out  bob
thanks robert, however, could you elaborate a little more on your statement, &quot;i think this is webmail which is, well, what it is&quot;. appreciated with thanks. windows vista home premium.
when you access a web site the html code and more is coming from that web server. since we can't install an old version like an application, it is what they want us to use. you could elect to not use web based email and go get some app? bob
robert. what does this mean and how do i go about getting other email providers that are not web based. do you recmmend this action? thanks &quot;you could elect to not use web based email and go get some app?&quot;
now that you know what web email is, you can look at email apps and see if you want those. many pick up thunderbird and you can use your yahoo email account. at least according to;  however, if you are asking what web email is now, i fear you will be put off by having to learn about smtp, imap and more. bob
