i have an hp 6635 pavilion running win 98 and linux i want to upgrade it to xp. i formatted the drive. but linux still comes up when the machine boots up. the linux has errors and that does not boot up properly help
you just need to rewrite the boot loader. if you find your way to the xp recovery console, then fixmbr will overwrite it. in closing, a proper xp install does not use the old dos format command. those who don't learn the new ways tend to suffer a little. bob
how did you format the drive? if it was truly formatted, linux should not be able to &quot;come back&quot;.
so the xp installation disk doesn't actually reformat when you tell it to? thats odd...but not surprising. is there an easy way to zero a drive using the xp disk?
i've never found a format that did. programs like fdisk (from dos/me days) and fixmbr diddle with that. bob
i was wondering about this. i tried to install xp after formatting the drive (via xp cd) and...low and behold...all of the old user files were still there. what i am used to.... with the ox install cd you have the option for 3 levels of erasing: quick, zero, zero then write random. i assumed this was standard.
