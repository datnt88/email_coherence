i am looking for a port replicator with extra usb hubs...basically a docking station plus usb hub. mostly what i would like are parallel, serial, ps2, and 6+ usb hubs, with power. i have heard there are items like this out there, just wondering if anybody could recommend a brand. thanks!
it does have ps2 for mouse/kbd, 1 rs232, 1 parallel and 4 usb 2.0 ports. i've yet to see one with more. it connects to an usb 2.0 port so i'm unsure if you would call it a docking device but it saves me a few connections. bob
maybe i'm not sure how a docking station is different from a port replicator. but basically, i wanted something with its own power to plug my computer in to the aforementioned ports, but with extra usb's so that i don't have to buy 2 different devices. does that make sense?
and i shared what i found. i haven't seen one that met your specs. but it seems close. cheers, bob
