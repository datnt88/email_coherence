i had a quick question, will a agp gfx card, specifically radeon x1600 pro, fit in a pci express x16 slot? i was thinking of purchasing the gigabyte ga-p35-ds3l lga 775 intel p35 atx. can anyone tell me if my current gfx card will fit in this mobo? thanks, devin.
answer is no.
agp and pci-e are very different video cards, thus no go. -----willy
