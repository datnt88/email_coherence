7956	4	560395	5297018	5296997	dubina	4/9/12 3:04 pm	1.33398384e12	ok	i got the router years ago and may or may not be able to find a how-to chapter on setting wifi router passwords. my question, however, was whether or not there is one passwork/security key for the network and another one for the router, as the epson error message has led me to believe. i know the network password/security key works for the network, so why does the wirelss printer not take it?
7956	5	560395	5297099	5297018	r. proffitt	4/9/12 5:46 pm	1.33399356e12	should be the same however	i had a hp wireless printer that did not work with my router. other settings and other routers, sure. but as i wanted to keep my router i returned the printer for another make and that fixed it. as to why the wireless printer not taking it is pretty simple. there is a software bug somewhere. and it's showing up by not letting you set it up. there can be other reasons such as the person who set up the router enabled mac address security but that does not matter as you don't administrate your router. suggestion? connect the printer to the router with ethernet to solve it. bob
7956	6	560395	5297184	5297099	dubina	4/10/12 12:26 am	1.33401756e12	thanks bob	that seems reasonable. i guess i will still be able to share the printer on the network. i say guess because i tried to do that, but failed. i connected an ethernet cable to the printer and then went into setup using the epson disk. copied all the epson printer files to the imac, then tried to do the printer setup on the epson, then tried to get the imac to add the epson printer. when i first got the printer a few months ago, the imac found it on my wireless network, connected, and i was able to print from the imac with no trouble. after resetting the network password/security key, the imac connected to the wireless network, but the epson refused. i described that problem earlier. now, per your advice, i ran an ethernet cable from the router to the printer and tried to connect. no dice. i am not sure what to do. the epson install disk has a users manual for all knds of things like copying, faxing, etc. but nothing much on setting up to an ethernet network (and i'm not sure that i have an ethernet network just because i ran an ethernet cable between the router and the printer), or a wireless network through an ethernet cable (because i suspect i will be asked for the wireless password/security key that eposon doesn't seem to like), and finally, if the imac is supposed to detect the epson automatically after i put the ethernet cable in, it has refused to do that so far. in short, i may be closer to getting the printer back, but i am not there yet. probably the question i need to have answered at this point is how do i proceed if the imac doesn't see the epson at the end of the ethernet cable.

7956	8	560395	5298901	5297368	dubina	4/13/12 7:27 pm	1.33434522e12	i'm not sure about that.	bob, you said, &quot;i usually have the printer dhcp at first then latter if i have time set it to some known address on my lan.&quot; my printer currently has an ip address of 0.0.0.0. that can't be good. otherwise, i don't know how to &quot;dhcp&quot; a printer. is that &quot;automatic&quot; or do i have to go to a command prompt or something? &quot;you write about using the epson cd but for setting the printer settings on the printer i use the controls on the printer to do that.&quot; i can set ink, maintenance, etc, but the &quot;setup&quot; menu has nothing to do with an ip address or making a connection. apart from the setup menu button, there is a network settings and a wireless network setting. but i don't know how they work or how they apply to my printer ethernet-linked to my router. you said, &quot;and again about the espon cd. i've found such cds to be out of date even on a new printer. i always head to epson.com and get their latest.&quot; the cd install worked fine a couple of months ago when i linked the epson to my wireless network. why should it not work now? thanks, bob
