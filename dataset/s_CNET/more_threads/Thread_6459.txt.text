this is in reference to post 18 of 18 at:  i installed a new canon pixma mp830 this morning. i went to canon's website and checked for new drivers and/or new firmware, and none is available. with my previous a-i-o's, i have not checked for new drivers or firmware and haven't had a problem until the hp a-i-o referenced in the above link. i am not clear as to when this needs to be checked. is this something that needs to be done periodically or only when problems develop? thank you.
if it ain't broke. . . seriously, if it works, leave it alone. many a printer, scanner, and pc have been hosed by &quot;updating&quot;.
your post. i agree with your thinking, and that's why i leave things alone until i have reason to act to solve a problem. however, i thought maybe i wasn't doing something i 'should' be doing to prevent a problem. thanks.
