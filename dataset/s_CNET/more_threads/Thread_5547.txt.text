my computer is a p4 2.66 ghz 512ram pc3200 agp 64-bit gf6200 256mb 40gb ata hd. what would be the cheapest most cost-effective option to speed up gameplay. (on aquamark03 i'm getting 18000) but i'm lagging a lot on bf vietman. i've heard upgrade ram and video card. which would work better?
another 512mb of ram (about $40-$70) could you help you some, but it won't double your framerate like a geforce 6600gt or an ati x1600pro could (about $130).
with all of these new cards coming out how long do you think it'll take for the price of a gf 7800gs to be in the $130-150 range?
nvidia has a 6 month project refresh cycle. they just refreshed their line, so the next big thing won't be out until the fall. the 6800gs will probably fall to $120 by then and the 7800gs should be about $200. the following refresh (about the same time as windows vista is debuting) should make the 6800gs (or similar) an entry-level card and the 7800 should reach your target price. however, by then pci express may be so dominant that agp becomes a niche market and niche product prices don't fall as quickly as mainstream products. that's why the 7800gs with 16 pipes is more expensive than the faster 7800gt with 20 pipes. ditto with x800xt agps selling for $280 while x850xt's are only $170.
isn't their something new coming out in the next few days
...their dual-core 7900gtx with two gpu's and 1 gb of ram on each card. imagine two of them in quad-sli. i'm also hoping that 7800 prices go down; i'm looking to replace my x600.
somehow i got stuck with a gf6200 256mb 64-bit.
here's nvidia's homepage. they're having a countdown for the new graphics card.
