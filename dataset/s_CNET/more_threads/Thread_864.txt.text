i am looking at e-readers, for my mother for mother's day. price is not an issue. what e-reader would you recomend and why?
quite simply amazon's ebook pricing is quite the saver. i have the nook color and prices are quite a lot higher. after playing with the nook color i decided as a bn nook i wasn't going to get much use from it. i went to  and turned it into an android tablet. i installed amazon's kindle reader than thought &quot;this nook color is a very nice kindle reader.&quot; bob
look into the kindle fire as a possible choice. $200 bucks to get her a e-reader (in color) that also can also play movies, games, etc. kindle fire is the next best thing to the ipad and it brings the price down $299. but, just read your &quot;price is not an issue&quot; again.... so you may want to just up for the ipad if you got the cash.
