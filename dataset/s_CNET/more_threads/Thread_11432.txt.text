hi got unreal tournament 3 for christmas bin workin fine up untill today when i got a blue screen error i think the error was nv4_display. manually rebooted , xp loads but when desktop loads this screen appears: [img= i installed the latest drivers for my graphics card the day of the crash. think this might be the problem but can not get on to desktop to sort it out. any ideas on a solution? cheers system spec: xp sp2 intel pentium d 2.8ghz (dual core) geforce 7600 gs 256mb driver number 169.28 from  1gb corsair ram asus motherboard
restart in safe mode and set the card to the refresh rate of the monitor. also set the resolution to the monitor's default.
for directx we need to click start, run and enter dxdiag wait a moment and click on the right most tab labeled &quot;more help&quot; click on &quot;override&quot; set the override value to 60 for your first test. click ok. click exit. bob
or maybe a roll back.
get the stop error code example stop(0x000000eb) then search it from support,microsoft.com
