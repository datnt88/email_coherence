how can i set up our router (d-links 655) to limit our roommate's bandwidth?
ftp://ftp.dlink.com/gateway/dir655/manual/dir655_manual_150.zip this router does not offer a feature to limit bandwidth. you can however block p2p use which would accomplish the same thing for abusive users. bob
what is p2p? i don't want to completely block our roommate's internet access. however, i do have a scheduled time when i disconnect everyone from the internet, so i am the only one online. i have secured our wireless connection with a complicated network name and password, so our roommate cannot get online wirelessly.
and it does appear to have some hours of operation to block this or that. you can google research p2p so no need for me to write what that is. -&gt; let say you used a complicated name and password on a wep protected network. today's easy to use tools can get that information in about 2 minutes. go figure why they offer wep. bob
