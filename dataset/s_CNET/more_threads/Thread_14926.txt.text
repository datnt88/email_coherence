you should be able to do it easily:  read the whole article but the link shows where in the bios to look. i recommend you do some study before messing with your system, however. you can do unrepairable damage if you do not know what you are doing.
hello people... i am avik i have just got a pentium d 805 with d945gnt (intel)...please tell me how to overclock it... i dont get any overclocking related options in the cmos setup... should i upgrade my bios???if yes, from where should i download the new one? and how to flash it? please help me.. avik
get clockgen - then in pll setup use ics 954148 as the clock generator. you can only overclock it by 7% .
in clockgen selecting pll as ics 954123 gives better overclocking than ics 954148. i will keep replying until i find the best overclocking trick.
