i bought some new ddr2 memory, but it won't fit. both my old and new memory have 240 pins. the memory i had has 64 pins then a gap then 56 pins (each side), which looking at google images and wikipedia seems standard. the new memory, (hyf2536481g) has 68 pins then a gap then 52 pins (each side). the gap is 73mm from the edge i thought all ddr2 memory had the same layout; has anyone come across this? i thought they might have sent ddr because of the gap position, but ddr has fewer pins.
what help do you need? you can't change that stick. so return it and buy the right one. the memory finder at  surely will lead to that. or - if you prefer a physical shop above a webshop - take an old stick with you when doing the exchange. kees
i would buy the 'right one' if i was confident of what that is. i would also like to find out if it was my mistake for ordering the wrong memory or the retailer has the wrong information on the memory; wikipedia describes dimm ddr2 as being specifically identifiable by a gap 70mm across (which would fit) and not 73mm. crucial doesn't have the system listed or i would have ordered from them. the motherboard is ms-7301, which supports up to 2gb ddr2 memory. i did a bit of research and can't find any information on different pin positions in dimm ddr2 memory, so i am a bit apprehensive about reordering until i find out so the same mistake isn't made; pc5300 ddr2 dimm should be the right memory.
i can't find it on crucial.com, indeed, but  is the page for the 7302. that says: ddr2 pc2-5300, ddr2 pc2-6400, ddr2 pc2-8500 (non ecc). might apply to the 7301 also. what does the manual say? back to the retailer seems the best way to go. kees
note the notch moves from ddr2&gt;ddr3
hyf2536481g that shows to be ecc ram. is that what you want? i've never played with the stuff.......perhaps the slot location moves.
it's not on their system list, despite being a packard bell, but the system scanner link worked on that page you posted. memory suggested is 2no 1gb ddr2 pc2-5300. i don't think the ones misco sent are proper ddr2, so i'll see if i can get a refund then reorder else where.
the right ram for your pc ? exactly what is the pc model, series and number ? last did you, check your pc manuals or check the mfgs website ? vapcmd
