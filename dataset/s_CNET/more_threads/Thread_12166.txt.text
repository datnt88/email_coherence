building new system- kit came with rounded cable option, do i set all drives to cable select-or--master / slave- i at first thought because there weren't 80 conductors (like ata133 ribbon cables) that master / slave would be the way- but have had several people say-noo, use cable select??? wuwt??
you can try the other way, but why is there confusion here? bob
80 conductor cables. if they weren't your mobo will tell you that they aren't if you are using any drive of ata 66 or above. they also will be keyed such that the end connector is master [for cs] and the middle connector is the slave.
that's all they are, ribbon wire, slit and bundled neatly in round form. same = same. use the master / slave pinning as you normally would.
