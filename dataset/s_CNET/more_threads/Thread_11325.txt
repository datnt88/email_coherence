''they really made it look like x didn't they?'' ''a dock?'' ''wait... genie?'' ok, i get it... check this out when you have more than a minute. 8 page pdf from a guy with a different way of looking at security. by page three, you understand why windows is security bell, and why vista will be the same. believe it or not, it's because bill's really smart! a bit dry, but very thought provoking, and a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone with clicking problems  lampie.

2763	10	148297	1658024	1656169	lampietheclown	1/9/06 7:36 am	1.13679216e12	need more	hey grim, i may just be missing something, but does your internet come from the sat system, or the phone line? on a sat system the internet comes from the dish, but you transmit using the phone line. this is usually for rural areas that can't get high speed any other way. if the internet signal comes from the phone line the dtv box might not be able to tell the difference between the phone ani signal and the internet signal. it may be pings from someone looking for your system, or verizon dhcp checking to see if your ip address is free. here's a link to how caller id works  lampie
2763	11	148297	1658070	1656169	lampietheclown	1/9/06 7:55 am	1.1367933e12	another thing...	you hooked up the wifi at the same time you first hooked up the winbox, so it may be the wifi that is causing it. try getting rid of the wifi and see if the problem goes away. lampie
2763	12	148297	1659004	1658070	grimgraphix	1/9/06 2:08 pm	1.13681568e12	info...	the dsl is from verizon via the telephone... the satellite receiver has caller id built into it so you can know who is calling by the id showing up on the tv screen. the wifi was in use from the beginning when i first got it back in august because the dsl modem had wifi built into it and the ibook had airport card from the factory. the erroneous caller id with no number or ring through that displays on the satellite caller id (but not on the phone's handset) only started after the pc was hooked up to the wifi network. i have yet to talk with verizon or directv so i can't give much more input yet. i just thought it interesting that the display only started after the pc was in the network... big brother in the house? will update as soon as i have anything. grim
