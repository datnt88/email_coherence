[one reason i might need 5 ghz for the network, to prevent interference.] the router will sit in a window in the main building with a clear shot to the windows in the trailer. about 120 feet. if necesary the computer's location in the trailer can to optimized for the antenna on the pci slot. [unless there are extension antennas]. plenty of info on the 2.4 b or g units but not much on the a g . i know that there is a &quot;high&quot; gain antenna available for 2.4 but haven't seen one for 5 ghz. any ideas and also recco's on which brands, based on experience???
