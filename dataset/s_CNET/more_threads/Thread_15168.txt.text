take a volt meter to the cmos battery and if it's the common cr2032 it must be over 3 volts. next, research bad caps. finally since there are no make, models here, that's also a sign of an overtaxed power supply. it's a shame details are missing as it could be one of the common issues but without details, you have to check these and more. bob
see if it's the other monitors with the problem, or the computer. that gets half the job done.
