can i use only an hdmi cable to connect a new vizio 26 inch television which i am going to use as a monitor to a new gateway computer ?
as long as the gateway has an hdmi port on the back
you need to install a vid card with hdmi capability to get audio/video. if the monitor has vga or dvi you could still hook up and use for a monitor but no audio.
this guide will help you pick the right cable-  be sure to check out windows media center if you get the chance
