this is a dell dimension 8200 with 256 ram. it has a 30gb drive that was pre-installed, a maxtor 120gb drive that i installed, a liteon dvdrom ltd163, and a hl-dt-st cd-rw gce-8400b cd drive. i turned off the computer, took out the 120 gb drive, restarted the computer, used it a few times, and noticed that the cd drives were not working: they showed up in device manager as having damaged configurations in the registry. i tried uninstalling the drivers, but that didn't work. what should i do?
check the jumper configuration and bios settings, then from device manager uninstall both the drives and scan for hardware changes. both the drives will be detected and installed automatically.
you probably unseated the connections when you removed the hd. and life goes on... jack
