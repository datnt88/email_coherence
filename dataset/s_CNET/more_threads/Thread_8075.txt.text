i'm about to install a radeon 7770 graphics card. (considering gtx 650 ti, but there is a huge cost difference now.) current build is amd a6-3500 llano 2.1ghz msi a55m-p33 fm1 amd a55 (hudson d2) micro atx amd motherboard with uefi bios 850 power supply (i know it's a lot--what was available on quick notice) 4 gb memory i'm wondering if the cpu is good enough for gaming, or will i need to upgrade the cpu. games are guild wars 2 fallout 3 gta iv minecraft chivalry midieval warfare thanks.
but if you read the usual cpu reviews the a6 is a little weak. even the a10 comes up short against the usual i5 but work? should work.
exactly what i was looking for.
