hey all, i have a few questions that i have been having a hard time finding the answer to. i am building a new pc and i want to use a ultra320 scsi drive for my os and programs. hard drive - maxtor atlas 15k 18gb ultra-320 scsi  controller - lsi logic lsibbu02 scsi controller  now my questions are as fllows. 1) is this the controller i need, and will it take full advantage of the harddrives capabilites? 2) will i be able to get the full speed out of this setup even though it is in a pci slot? 3)is this all that i need to set up scsi in my pc? oh yes, the minimum specs this system will have: cpu - amd athlon 64 3000 mob - 939 or 754 not really sure which ram - 1gb dual channel 400mhz oc vid - geforce 6600 256mb thanks!
anyone?
usually scsi systems are a throwback to the bad old days when ide didn't work so well. your choice, but don't be surprized if some 99 buck sata drive boots faster. bob
