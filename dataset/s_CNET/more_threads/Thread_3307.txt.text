i am having some issues with my samsung hd 501 jk internal that came installed in my hp pavillion a6500f. i am very concerned that it is about to die. after a little searching, i have read that even the replacements that samsung sends out are junk. any suggestions on a different hd of similar size/speed to replace it with?
quite frankly there just isn't that many hd makers. off the top of my head, there is seagate, wd, samsung, hitatci and maxtor. seagate now owns samsung a as well as maxtor. any other label out there maybe a &quot;rebadged&quot; hd is different from those listed. i have found seagate to do well to include wd brands. i xclude any ext. mounted drives and any 2.5in. as well also anything ssd based. tada -----willy :i
i also had the same concern with my hp pavillion a 6500f not too long ago, and i decided it was time to get a replacement for my hd. i bought a western digital re3 wd5002abys-01b1b0 from here it has been working wonders for me! its a similar spec as the samsung, but personally think wd is more reliable than samsung's in the hd market.
