hello, i have external wd 1tb hard drive. fat32. one day 3 folder in my hard turned into 32kb files. i've red some articles and learned that it might be a cluster. dispite the fact, there was about 200gb data in these folders, hard drive's used and free space is same as it was. so i think my data should be somewhere in the hard drive. i've googled a lot, but i didn't found why my data turned into clusters. i want to know how to recover my files of these 3 folders. how to turn these clusters into folders with my data? thanks. windows has checked the file system and found no problems. 192kb in bad sectors. 32.768 bytes in each allocation unit. 30.516.298 total allocation units on disk. 11.341.087 allocation units available on disk. mantas
the makers supply drives in fat32 but it's far too unreliable for most of us. you'll want to start over but use ntfs for windows and apple's file system on that system. the files would be recovered from your backups or other copies. this forum is full of posts about people who &quot;stored&quot; their last copy of files on these externals and learn first hand why we can't ignore backups. -&gt; try recuva at google.com then: getdataback zero assumption recovery bob
if it is still relevant, the following post on tech support forums might help you:  the process of recovery is very time consuming, but can be well worth it for important or valuable files. proceed with caution through each step. cheers!
