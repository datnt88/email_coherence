after buying one stick of memory for an old laptop, i realized i should have gotten a dual channel kit. could i still get the dual channel effect if i ordered a second stick of the same memory?
looking at the details supplied it may or may now work. but dual channel does seem to work if both sticks are the same. bob
i stick to reputable brands that offer the exact same ram in kits as well. you can't go by specs but only by manufacturer pn. i tend to buy crucial or corsair but i'm sure there are other good names out there.
