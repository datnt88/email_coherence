13775	6	396750	3318078	3318075	r. proffitt	6/8/10 7:55 am	1.2759837e12	the good news is	the chances are slim that anything bad happened. if you had smoke coming from chips and the old star trek hit by klingon fire effects then you wouldn't be asking.

13775	8	396750	3318403	3318082	brechan	6/8/10 5:34 pm	1.27601844e12	only a waste of	money and time if we don't learn by our mistakes. computer cases aren't as expensive as some may think; while you don't want to go the 'el cheapo' route, you don't have to spend $900+ for the thermaltake level 10. you can usually get a decent (starter) case for under $100  and power supplies don't have to put you in the poorhouse either
