i wanted to set up a small wiresless network for my home office. i am using dial up service to access internet here. but i got 3 laptops connected via bluetooth. i am using one of my laptop as the host and the dial up cord in connected to that laptop, now ow to configure the other laptops so as the other ones too can get access to internet when the host laptop does! i've gone too the manuals, but too complicated and no sucess for me. plz advice! priesha
configure your host and client computers for &quot;ics&quot;  it should work with any networking setup including bluetooth.
stop now before all your hair is gone and start over with wifi. bluetooth at some pokey serial port speeds and 10 to some few more feet range is going to make this nearly impossible to setup. this is much like watching a man standing on the ledge of a 10 story building. &quot;don't do it.&quot; bob
i thought the bluetooth range is 10metres ..but its only 10feet????!!! any other ways which i can try? it does connect via the serial port ...but then i cant seem to get internet access on the client pc!
and 10 meters is usually only line of sight at 100 or so kilobits per second (most hardware.) this is truly a bad idea for networking. bob
