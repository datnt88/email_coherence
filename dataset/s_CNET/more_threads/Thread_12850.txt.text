i believe i bent the pins on the back of the motherboard when i pressed down on it to put in the ram.
did you look?
if you believe you bent pins, then inspect closely and unbent with deft care. otherwise, you will be repairs and/or replacement. you may have to remove the mtrbd. to inspect area in question. tada -----willy
what purpose do those pins serve?
your system working? if not, inspect. if it is, then don't worry about it. i shouldn't have to explain any pin(s) on an electrical device will have &quot;electricity/signals&quot; going through, so what is the fix worth to you or the &quot;time&effort&quot; to rest assured. a bent pin can be in contact with other pins and/or short or become an intermittent area of problems. its not a matter of looking right but of being able to work or prove that's not an issue. tada -----willy
