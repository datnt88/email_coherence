hello, i have no idea if this is in the right forum or not, so please don't complain about it. anyway, when ever i put in a black dvd-r+ into my dvd drive/burner, it switches to a cd drive. i have tried enabling recording and switching the registry drive numbers from 1 to 2 as said on ms's website. i also tried uninstalling it and restarting letting windows configure it itself. any help would be greatly appreciated. i am running windows xp media 2005, latest updates from windows update service.
that's not a sign of any issue. xp does not know about dvd recording so there's nothing to fix here. bob
so you're saying that xp doesn't have support to burn dvds? well, could you recommend an app that does it for free and efficiently? thanks again.
if you're in a hurry ... you can easily find what you're looking for (or attractively-priced commercial sw) through your favorite search engine. i use/recommend roxio easy cd creator and you can get good deals on it if you're willing to look ... but free it's not. good luck vapcmd
imgburn. if you want to author dvd's for free, that is also available. check out the tools (on the left side) here :  there are guides to tell you how. give a look.
