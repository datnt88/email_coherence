i have an old dlink di-604 that i'd like to configure to work as a switch. i think this is possible but not sure how to do it. switches are cheap but if i could save a few bucks with some tweaking i'd prefer that. plus i figure i'd learn a bit about networking. dlinks site on the di-604:  my main problem is i have uverse and i'm out of wired ports on the residential gateway. i would like 2 more ports to network my pc and nas, so my laptop and xbox can access their files.
i'd configure it as wap. i see no reason to use any other method even if this has no wifi. i'd use the same instructions. google this -&gt; how to configure a router as a wap. bob
i'll give it a go. how about this tutorial, looks detailed enough but i have never done this before and don't have a lot of networking experience.
i know it's a little difficult but the idea is to play along with those instructions as if it's a wifi router. just skip over any wifi areas and it should work. bob
i have to be honest, i don't 100% understand what i did and it took a bit but i got it working. thanks for your help.
