i booted nad used my pc this morning with no problems what so ever. i had to leave and shut it down the way i always do, properly. when i attempt to reboot now i enter my password, my desktop background image appears and then it immediately says &quot;saving settings&quot; and returns to my password screen. i have atempted to reboot in safe mode &quot;last known good starting point&quot;, regular safemode and i get the same thing. pc will not complete boot process or let me go any farther to diagnose problem. i am running a: sony vaio pcv-rx650 winxp_sp2 nvidia tnt 2 64/pro gpu with 32mb's of on board ram 512mb's of system ram 80gb hd with 68 gb free space. just wondering if anyone could help me out with this dilemna? would greatly appreciate it! thanks.
for example, the hidden 'administrator' account (default: no password) you only see on the safe mode welcome screen. things like this are exactly the reason why it's recommended to have 2 admin accounts available (and reachable) on a machine. if one is corrupted (that could be the case here) you can use the other to make a new one, transfer files and continue as if (practically) nothing had happened. of course, if the corruption is on a 'deeper' level, this won't help. kees
only one administrator account . but problems occurs with all accounts created on machine. never read anything on that. thanks for input, will remember for future reference.
