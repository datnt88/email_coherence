i am currently looking for parts to build a computer and was wondering which processor was better. this new computer will be used mainly for surfing the web and listening to music.
either one will problaly do just fine. so go with the least expensive one.
if you look at the benchmarks out there, a celeron d at 2.4ghz will perform about the same as a sempron 2400+(1.667ghz). however, a sempron/motherboard combination will be a bit cheaper than a celeron d/motherboard combo. plus, the celeron d's are quite loud and run hot. the only time i would get a celeron d is if you wanted to overclock it.
