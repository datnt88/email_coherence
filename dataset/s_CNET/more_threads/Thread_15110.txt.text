i have an elderly lady friend who needs a home phone, email, occasional web surfing and streaming video (tv) - all-in-one portable device. can a tablet do all that? or do you have to add something like a voip adapter/phone?
let's see if i can find it.  is not clear about this but you can go to the att store and see it. bob
i had a look and found &quot;call functions - multitasking&quot;, which seems to imply that it has phone functionality, but no details. att wasn't much better. i'll wait to see if any others can help.
that's very strange. they are usually very chatty at the store about the products. i know the next size down has the phone, but this one is one i haven't checked out in deep detail. it does do skype so would you consider that a phone call? bob
i know skype would work, but was looking for actual cellphone functionality using built-in speaker/mic and bluetooth headsets. the att site only gives basic details.
if they won't talk to you, no sale. i agree on that point. but i have seen folk make &quot;calls&quot; on the samsung galaxy tab with the cell phone in it. but you may want more assurance than that so your best insight would be to go to the store that has this model and get a demo. bob
it does not work because at&t gutted this function in the samsung models delivered for the us - shame on them... models for europe are fully functional, though... and if you unlock your tablet i am sure there are ways to make it work - there are articles about it on the net....
months ago at some meeting (i am in some work that involves cellular) i saw this make a call over the cell phone so i used that for my answer. thanks for the correction. as this is an old discussion, it's now closed. bob
