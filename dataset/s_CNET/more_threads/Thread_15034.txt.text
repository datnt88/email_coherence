ive just put in my mce cd and theres a message that appears saying ntldr is missing, i have no idea what that is. can anyone help? thanks in advance
type the error mesage with the ntldr word into google.com while you supplied one word of the error message, without details no do this other than for you to use google.com is likely to help. bob
thank you
...across virually all windows platforms, that says the computer failed to find the operating system! it does that by looking for a few vital but hidden system files on the hard drive....if it can't find these, you get the &quot;ntldr not found&quot; (nt loader) error. if you've just installed the operating system from cd, without any problems, it's a good indicator that you'll likely have to enter your computer bios, and set boot &quot;hard drive #1&quot; first. it's likely set to &quot;boot from cd&quot; at the moment, which dending on hardware can stop the system booting from hard drive, even if that is listed as another boot option. good luck, geebee.
