(those expiration messages are just so annoying.) now it won't print black & white because it says we are out of yellow ink. what does yellow ink have to do with printing black & white? we don't know whether to throw this piece of cr*p away or buy more ink and put up with grinding noise. this is windows 7 home 64-bit. any advice would be most welcome!

(oops.) i see folk do sell used ones starting at 50 bucks so your choice to get another to take its place without issues. bob
