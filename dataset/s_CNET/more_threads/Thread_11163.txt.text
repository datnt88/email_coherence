hi need help again i was helping my friend set up a linksys router and a wireless card on the computer that has the router it has windows xp dont know to much about both computer and the one with the wireless card is an amd we had to put a expander on it because it was not picking up the signal but now it is but when we connect to the internet it say no connection. when you look at the picture it shows the wireless card talking to the router with the range expander but the next picture is the picture of the internet and it is grayed out all other pictures are color. keep saying not connected., the wireless card has window 98 hope i have enough info thanks for the help all
no make/model and firmware version so all i can offer is that you need to check for latest firmware and drivers.
if you are talking about the computer amd 400 mhz amd 550 mhz the router is linksys model number wrt54g v.3 wireless-g 2.4 ghz wireless card linksys range expander linksys dont know the model number of the expander my friend is not home from church yet
then look to see if they offered newer drivers. so far, the clues of what's amiss is not in what you've written since i don't see the firmware version. the maker's website has the firmware and drivers. i don't go over the setup that's in the manual so if you didn't i won't know. bob
