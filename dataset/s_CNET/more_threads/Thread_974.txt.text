hi guys!!, i just want a good blu ray player for my new hdtv gp1u 1080p 1920x1080, that can be connected to the pc internally. i dont like a lot the blu ray burner because each disc cost around $22.. its a lot of money for only just one. so i saw this one:  , but i dont now anything about blu ray. i know that nmy video card its a bfg 8800 gt hdcp ready, and my procesor intel e6850 3.0ghz with corsair xms2 4gb 800mhz . thanks you!.
go with sony, after all, they problaly have sold the most br-player mechanism. i see they are at fry's for about $130. oh, by-the-way, br disc media can be had for about $10. not that it matter.
thanks for your lighting response. pd. you know if my hdtv its hdcp ready?
yes. all hdmi connections are hdcp protocol capable (if i remember correctly).
totally agree about using sony, after all they are the developers.saw another manufacturer's unit and was troubled, seemed a bit wobbly.
