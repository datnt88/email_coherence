hi i want to upgrade my pc i know what i need/want my mobo has to have one agp slot for my vid card and i want ddr 2 thats alot to ask for i know but i found a mobo that handles that but every one i talk to says it sucks i have never heard of the bradn but if you dont plan on overclocking it shouldnt matter right. i mean im gunna get a 3.6 processor 2gb of ddr2 ram so i wont need to over clock any thing. basicaly all im asken is does the mobo really matter unless u plan to overclock. if i could find a better mobo i would get it but there is only one iv found that handles what i want heres the mobo i was thinken about getten  ps if any one knows about mobos that handle ddr2 and has one agp slot tell me pls
why do you want a agp vid card?? pci express is faster and you can run sli. which cpu are you going to use??
do you have that sways you to get a mobo with agp?
your going to have to get a lga775 motherboard to get ddr2. as for agp, i would not get an agp mobo with ddr2. it's pointless. get pci express for the bandwidth and future proofing.  ^ has agp and ddr2  ^ has pci express and ddr2 konny
a) it's not pci-x, pci-x is 64-bit pci running at 66mhz, 100mhz or 133mhz and is used for enterprise level add in cards such as $1000 raid controllers b) your thinking of pcie (also called pcie or pci-e) which is another interface avliable for server boards that has recently been ported to consumer level equipment for graphics, it allows sli or crossfire if you have the following: a) a chipset that supports it b) graphics cards that support it c) a motherboard that supports it d) a power supply that can handle it your post is mostly wrong and he did state the cpu he was consider the pentium 4 3.6ghz
