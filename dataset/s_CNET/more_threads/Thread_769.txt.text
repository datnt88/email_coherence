so yesterday i decided to clean my system and when i was trying to remove the cpu fan and heatsink, i broke the plastic cradle that keeps it down (see image 1). i then realized even though one side was still intact, my computer would shutoff immediately. oh and i also noticed the cpu and bottom of the heatsink looks as if they were overheating (i'm not sure if that's the correct terminology; see images 2 and 3). i've had my computer for about 5 years now: asus p4p800 se p4 3.0 ghz prescott socket 478 2gb crucial pc3200 ddr400 maxtor 200gb hdd dvd-rw and cd-rw drive 3.5 floppy ati radeon x1600 pro antec 430w psu    what are my options from here? thanks in advance.
i'm near boston. where you at? free if you're there.
are the markings on the cpu and heatsink just from normal wear and tear? or is it something to worry about? do i need a new fan and/or heatsink or is just a replacement part just fine?
socket 478 fans, heatsinks and such are cheap compared to a new machine. that part is out there on someone's shelf, basement or garage. ask for it on freecycle. bob
