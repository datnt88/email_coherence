i'm fairly new at setting up networks and could use some advice with this setup. i've accomplished a wireless setup on 5 machines, but that's about the extent of my hands on experience. i would like to network three machines for file sharing. they all access the same t-1 line. 2 machines running windows 98se. 1 machine running xp home. i would like for the xp machine to be the host. i've read about different methods for setting this up. frankly, it's a little confusing to a novice. i would like to hear from those of you who have experience with t-1 line network setup. also, what, if any, hardware is needed? (router, switch, etc.) thanks for any suggestions. ernie
since i've gotten no response to this post, i thought i would answer my own questions. i set up the network using the netbuie protocol with printer & file sharing. the xp machine required a different configuration and the extracting of some files from the xp cd, but it all came together and works great.
i've got two computers running on wireless g that can share a printer and two that are on wireless b cards that cannot share the same printer. do all the computers need to be on wireless g to share the printer? i wireless b capable of printer sharing? thought you might be able to help.
make sure all the pcs are identified with the same workgroup name. if the printer is connected to a pc (versus a print server port on the router/switch), you may need to be sure that each user has an account to which the printer is connected. i used to have a router/switch with a printer port on it which meant any pc on the network could print to it at any time. i replaced the printer and my new one only connects by usb to the pc. i had to replace the r/s, and now the main pc has to be on for the others to be able to print.
