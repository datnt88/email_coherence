this is a project that i have been working on for about a week now...i've been trying to see if i can build a 64-bit pc for less than seven hundred dollars. and this morning i finally did it! here's the config: case: antec solution series- $56 motherboard: ecs 755-a-$80 processor: amd athlon 64 2800+- $187 memory: geil ultra series platinum (512 mb ddr433)-$128 video card: gigabyte radeon 9200- $69.99 optical drive: lite-on ltc-48161h (dvd-rom/cd-rw combo)-$43.50 floppy: alps df354h068f- $14 hard drive: samsung sp1604n (160 gb)- $93 i can get all that for $675.99! now all i have to do is build it and see how it does...
.
the athlon-64 will run dos, linux or what have ia32 oses or later. microsoft is keen to not let the 64-bit crowd escape to linux so easily. see  bob
where did you get the motherboard and the amd athlon 64 2800?
looks good dude, and don't skimp on the power supply. for those that don't want to build: $672 already built with about same components when customized:  $666 built with speakers, keyboard, mouse and 120gb hd  monarch will build just about the same thing for $49 after selecting almost all the same parts (aprx $775) from them:
newegg ( has the 2800+ cpu and the motherboard.
