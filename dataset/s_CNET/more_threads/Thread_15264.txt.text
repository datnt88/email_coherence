i just bought apple's time capsule, which is a combination hard drive and an airport base station wireless router. not surprisingly, the time capsule works perfectly with all my other apple computers, but so far my wife has not been apple to access the internet from her compaq desktop, with newly installed, netgear wireless-g pci adaptor. netgear's connection wizard recognizes the airport base station, and seemingly allows a connection, but then continues to scan, looking for other signals. we have yet to be able to use it to connect to the internet. does anyone know how i can overcome this problem? much thanks.
there's also a possibility you have a firewall blocking something. your post is light so i'll just start with the top 2 items. bob
i'm not sure what you mean by &quot;sticky,&quot; but i do have the network protected with a password. the netgear wizard allowed my to lock in the password and access the network, but right after it connected up, it resumed searching through the other channels, trying to find another netwrok. did i miss something in the settings? thanks for your help. -paul -------
and its the first and top post. you didn't share the details so i'll just reiterate the above.
