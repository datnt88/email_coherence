hello all, i've been using this dvd writer for the past year and had no problems. recently i've written 3 dvd's and weirdly enough it doesn't playback on the dvd writer itself but plays in any other player or dvdrom, so you could say data verification in nero is always a failure. any solution how i can play the dvd on the dvd writer, or is there any other problem?
these drives have plummeted to 20 bucks at newegg and only last a year or 2. -&gt; save yourself! swap the drive out and carry on. bob
are they dvds from a stack youve used before, or a new stack? if so , maybe you should check your drive to see what kind of dvds it can run/burn
