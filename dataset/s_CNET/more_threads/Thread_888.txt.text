has anyone ever wondered what would happen if you took a .22 calibur rifle to a 19&quot; pc monitor? go to  to find out! i thought it was a bit overrated, though.
elvis used to shoot out the tv picture tube while viewing inside his house, with a large caliber pistol, on several occasions, when he didn't like something that was on. (ain't got time for grammer, etc.. on this run off sentence)
i wonder what would happen if he shot it with a .50 calibur rifle? ((boooooooooom)) konny
and i only had to hit it once &lt;grin&gt;.
