i have lost the use of the geforce graphics card i installed over a year ago. i have an ibm netvista with windows me o/s. i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but windows keeps defaulting back to the intel video card the computer came with. i can not figure out how to disable the intel card and enable the geforce card so that my system defaults to it. when i plug my monitor into the geforce card i get a blank screen. i have to plug back into the original port to see anything on the monitor. i am as fustrated as can be. any ideas are welcome. thanks, todd
did you try going to control panel, system, device manager, click on display adapter, highlite the intel graphics controller click properties uncheck the box that says exists in all profiles? try that or highlite the intel graphics controller and click remove. try to update your driver from the nvidia web site. i believe the new driver is 56.04. if not it will tell you the latest driver. you might have a conflict problem running both devices. good luck hope i was able to help. ken
ken, yes, i tried exactly what you discribed. everytime the system finishes it says that it must restart in order to complete changes. when it restarts, it reloads the hardware and software for the intel video card. i went on their website asking for assistance but was disappointed with the results. thanks for the comments. todd
