i am thinking of purchasing 1 gb of pc3200 but i don't know if i should buy one stick or 2x512mb sticks. two 512mb sticks would be slightly cheaper but would there be any performance loss over the single 1gb stick? thanks in advance!
depending on the mother board 2 512s give you better and no matter what 512+512 = 1 gig
if one fails you still have memory. if you need 2gbytes of memory later it will cost you, thats about it.
yea, it'll cost u in the long run... but in the short run...2 sticks is a better deal
todays memory is made to some very exacting standards. so one would think that if they bought two sticks of the same type from the same maker and even if they came from different batches that they would be very close timing wise. if their not, well funny things might happen. if you only have one stick then timing between sticks becomes a non-issue. just something to consider. as for the perf thing you can run that through google but i suspect that unless your running some very demanding apps you will not see a diff.
unfortunately you have not told us the info that would make the answer accurate. most good quality modern motherboards require you use the memory in pairs and that is essential to get the top bus speeds. if you use only one stick it may not work at all or definitely will only get you half the speed the bus is supposed to run at. using 1 pc3200 stick gets you 400mhz bus speeed, using 2 in pairs (in slots that use them that way) gets you 800mhz. which do you think is better? now if you have a cheap motherboard it may not have the higher 800mhz speed and may not work with memory in pairs, in that case you can do what you wish. since you didn't tell us what motherboard you have we really can't give you the answer you really should have.
