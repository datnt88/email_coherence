hi. i have a 15 inch toshiba satellite notebook(as5-s126) and im looking for a good notebook cooler that will keep my laptop nice and cool. do you guys have any suggestions? thanks.
just about any type should suffice. just pick the one that suits you. most are under the laptop placement. you may want quietness as a good feature, so if you can't hear one operate, get it, but most run fairly quiet. those that run using the usb port for power, beware as that takes power less available for long periods of usage. tada -----willy
okay, i'm thinking between getting the antec notebook cooler or the targus tornado cooler. which one do you recommend, or are they just the same? thankss
both ar good brands nd products, go with the one you feel good with. i really don't think one is better than the other but i find targus more laptop knowledable in this area. tada -----willy
i use a targus notebook chill mat for my 12&quot; powerbook. it works pretty well but it might be a bit small for your laptop. my boyfriend has a 15&quot; widescreen laptop and got an antec notebook cooler. it has two (two-speed) fans and the surface is large enough to cover the entire base of his laptop. the only annoyance may be that the antec has a bright blue led light that turns on when you have the fan plugged in (via usb). otherwise, it might be the best one for you.
