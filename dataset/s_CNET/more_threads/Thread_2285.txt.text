i just switched from 98se to xp-pro and i'm having trouble setting up my visioneer 7600 parallel port scanner. i'm using paperport 8 and the software seems to work but the driver doesn't seem to work correctly. first: i have a p4, xp-pro, 256mb ram and two hard drives. i tried the compatibility wizard and the program just crashed. without the compatibility mode the program works with older scans completely but when i try to scan or preview an image the program does some funny things. it will start the scan and never quit making multiple copies of the image and i can't close the scan window. is anyone running this setup? do i have to upgrade (buy new) my scanner? thanks in advance, denny
visioneer does not support any of their parallel port scanners with xp, period. i have had a few clients that were burned by this, visioneer just decided it wasn't worth it. you need to buy a new scanner if you want to run xp. fortunately usb scanners are under $100.
parallel port devices are losing support all over. for much less that 100usb you find complete units like (excuse the vendor link)  which includes updated software to use with your updated os. bob ps. i have a few hp scanners and they seem ok.
thanks for your advice. i went to sam's club and bought a onetouch 9220 visioneer and it is working wonderfully. i stuck with visioneer because i like the paperport 8 software. the scanner is 4800 x 2400 and it only cost $80. it was worth the cost to get rid of the headache with the compatibility problems. i'm almost up to par with the xp configuration and so far(although a lot of work) i like it better. thanks again, denny
