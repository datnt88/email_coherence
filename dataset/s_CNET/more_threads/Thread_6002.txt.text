hello! i have a motherboard that support ata(80gb) and sata(320) hdd. my os is on the sata hdd. my problem is, when i copy something from the ata to the sata hdd and vice versa, my computer slows down, the mouse move staccato and the music is freezing,but the speed is very good ap.:50000kbtye. the question is,how this problem can be eliminated, or what cause this problem? p.s.: i need that ata hdd thanks for any help! dzsurnik
there are many reasons such as someone forgetting the motherboard drivers but here's my recurring favorite fix.
as my subject title says, my os is win7 64bit, and i installed all the drivers for motherboard, and uptaded. still can't find any solution for my problem
i experienced the same lackluster speed on my hp d4999t running windows 7 64 bit until i installed intel's matrix storage manager. notice how much i revealed in one sentence? and i will not find out what intel is calling that software today because i can't look it up everytime this comes up. please do a little work when needed. --&gt; i can't know if this applies but hope it does. just a tip. try to post all the details so folk have what they need to give you the best chance of success. bob
