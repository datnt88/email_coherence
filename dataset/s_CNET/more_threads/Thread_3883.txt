(example-a 32mb card will play ms flight 4...kinda..most of the game isnt rendered just by lack of memory). my card is a 256mb gainward nvidia card that i paid 80 bucks for new and works with what ever i throw at it. i dont think i will out grow that card for a long time to come...good luck and i hope it helped

(just kiddin) just stick around with the pro card - its awesum (wish i owned it !! i have a 9600 xt but im still very happy !)
