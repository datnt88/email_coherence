i have installed a wireless cnet card model cnwlc-811 and when it is plugged in it checks and blinks for a split second and then i get the red exclamation with the error listed in the subject line. (cnet wireless lan card lost). how can i fix this problem. the router is fine on the other computers. i am a novice so anyhelp would be good and an 800 number would be good to call cnet also. thanks m
have you tried another make/model card? bob
just in case you think this is the support site for that card.... it isn't. bob
what is the support site for the card or the 800 or non 800 number. i tried a linksys card and did not get that funtional because i ran out of time. m
i leave it to you to use google.com to find such. also, the person who sold you the cards should offer this support. i'd love to note more about this issue, but you haven't followed the forum tip. it reads: &quot;if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; the laptop make/model as well as the models of the cards, the os involved are needed to get a clue. some have this issue and it's just the wap's firmware was never updated. give google.com and the supplier a try or fill in the information blanks to see if this forum can help. bob
