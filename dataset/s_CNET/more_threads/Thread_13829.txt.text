i'm going to connect my graphics card to my hdt, but the graphics card end looks like this:  and i keep seeing cables like this:  does it work :&lt; ?
your graphics card has dvi output (your first picture). if your tv has dvi input, you need a dvi-to-dvi cable ( example ). if your tv has hdmi input, you need a dvi-to-hdmi cable ( example ).
two, actually. so i'm guessing that dvi to hdmi cable is the right one?
if your t.v does have an hdmi slot than i would get (well actually i have already gotten)  works flawlessly for me.
i have the same cable and used it when my monitor died. great cable and that price is just awesome. i just used the little 30 inch lcd tv 720p until i could decide on a new monitor.
