i have a computer with xp. lets call it pc1. it has a wireless card that connects to a router for the internet. a printer is hooked up to pc1. i have a laptop with xp that can print to the printer hooked up to pc1. i have another computer pc2 with windows me. i hooked up to pc1 with a cross over cable. the conection works for the internet, but when i bring in a laptop with a wireless conection to pc1 it wont let me print. i cant connect pc2 to the router. i shared the printer and files when i went thru the wizard. i checked the printer and its shared. not sure what elese to check.
it's not a standard setup so the wizards are powerless. try a more common setup. bob
honestly do yourself a favor and get rid of me, if that computer can't handle win2k or xp then at least put on 98se. instead of using a cross over cable, just use a patch cable and connect it to your router for that computer. you should then be able to share files and printer between these computers.
