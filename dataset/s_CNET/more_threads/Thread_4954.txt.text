i have just got my hp d4100e with this motherboard installed (asus a8ae-le). it has two 512 modules installed. i want to install this &quot;corsair xms 1gb ddr, xms3200&quot; module. however, i'm not sure if i need to install two 1gb module into the first two channels and the two 512 in the second two? looking for some help
if u have 2 doesnt really matter. wat do u need 3gb of memory for? or do u only have 1 module of corsair xms 1gb? if so since it is dual channel u will only get total of 1.5gb
i only have one module of the corsair. by installing this in the far left channel and the two 512 modules in the next two channels, i will only get 1.5 gbs. i order to get 2 gbs, i would need another 1 gig stick.
the problem is dual channel. u need to install ram in pairs. since u have 3, u can go either with what u have, 512 and 512, or 1gb and 512. if u get an additional 1gb module, u can have 1gb and 1gb and 512mb and 512mb occupying all 4 slots.
have a happy holiday
