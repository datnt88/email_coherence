my wife bought an ibook that she uses in her elder care business. the unit is used so going to a retailer is out of the question. i've decided to help her get connected at various hot spots and have been having difficulty with the airport subsystem. the ibook runs os x 10.2.8 (6r73), with 256 memory, and a processor speed of 700 mhz (powerpc g3). airport does not access a local hot spot that my desktop pc (gateway g6 450, running windows xp professional and using a linksys wireless-b pci adapter) easily does. the airport continues to show &quot;server not found&quot; message. how do i set up this airport user? thanks.
take a look at the airport setup assistant and see what is going on there. also, take a look at the apple system profiler and see if the airport card is actually recognized. remove the airport card, following the instructions on the apple web site, and reseat it into its slot. does the airport actually &quot;see&quot; the wireless hot spots or are you just trying to make it work at a known hotspot. theoretically, it should just &quot;see&quot; any wireless network. try the above and let us know p
how simple. i let her do all the keystrokes and &quot;voila&quot; internet access. didn't have to remove and reseat the card. thanks.
