i have a cannon pixma copier/printer/scanner connected to a targa xp computer. the printer and copier are working very well, but the scanner fails to work. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it from its disc but to no avail. any solutions or suggestions, other that dumping it please
i should have said that it is a cannon pixma mp130. ian
sadly the last test is to try it on another pc. often a part of these all in ones will fail and if the &quot;copy&quot; button works we still need to test if it works on other pc as a test of the all in one. there are other reasons today such as malware damage, firewalls and more but your post didn't tell if you tried the uninstall and reinstall without the pc being &quot;protected.&quot; bob
thanks for the info bob. unfortunately the only other pc i have is vista and it does not support the pixma mp130. i'll triy installing it with the firewall and viruse protection switched of. i'll let you know how i get on. ian
