6292	5	553067	5259849	5259880	r. proffitt	1/13/12 2:15 pm	1.3264641e12	the way to go for what?	just like a pc as we increase the cpu and more, what more does angry birds need to run? what apps did you run before that you need more oomph? and right around the corner is windows 8 and bluestacks. bob

6292	7	553067	5259868	5259867	r. proffitt	1/13/12 3:50 pm	1.3264698e12	just like most pcs	as we passed some ghz and cores, you have to ask what apps are in need of that quad core tablet. it is very nice but my advice is to wait till the dust settles from ces. bob
6292	8	553067	5260116	5259868	mws032653	1/14/12 6:18 am	1.32652188e12	in the future	as we look six months to a year into the future don't you think the quad core will trigger some pretty cool stuff?

6292	10	553067	5260272	5260224	mws032653	1/14/12 12:15 pm	1.3265433e12	price	so , at the same price as an ipad2 you feel it is too high now? you are right it will probably come down at least some.
6292	11	553067	5260285	5260272	r. proffitt	1/14/12 12:44 pm	1.32654504e12	for the price of an ipad i'd get the ipad 2.	you never revealed the use for this pad. i'm watching folk rush in and learn the lessons the hard way about apps and more. if you are jazzed about all this, don't buy until you can get past the jazz. as to your comment about if this will bring out this or that, let me comment about ice cream. some folk are waiting for that but developers i know won't use its new features because most folk are not that yet. they seem to be in agreement that in 6 months or a year they might have an ice cream feature app. bob

6292	13	553067	5260396	5259805	r. proffitt	1/14/12 7:22 pm	1.32656892e12	for that use folk are getting really upset.	please do yourself a favor and try to do what you wrote on any android tablet today. that use is exactly what i'm finding folk upset about. bob
6292	14	553067	5260473	5260396	mws032653	1/15/12 4:52 am	1.32660312e12	any tablet	a couple reasons i and looking strong at asus transformers(both old and prime) is the dock and polaris software.
6292	15	553067	5260590	5260473	r. proffitt	1/15/12 10:28 am	1.32662328e12	that will not fix the issues folk are having when	when they think they are going to produce word and such documents this is where folk are getting upset. my advice is to not buy this system for that use today. or if you do, don't spend so much you don't have the bucks for a laptop. bob
6292	16	553067	5260604	5260590	mws032653	1/15/12 11:30 am	1.326627e12	laptop	i have a laptop and polaris is compatible with microsoft office..the tablet will not be used as my only office tool. will use it that way mainly when i'm away from home/office.

6292	18	553067	5260637	5260634	mws032653	1/15/12 1:44 pm	1.32663504e12	thanks!!	thanks for all your advice.....
