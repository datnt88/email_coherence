i am experiencing a problem with my wireless, the only time it ever cuts out is when i play a game such as counter strike and even sometimes when i fullscreen a video on youtube. please help. i am running windows xp pro. belkin wireless g router and wireless network adapter.
set it up like our forum sticky asks? if not, tell what you chose as your settings.
i had it set up like it says but i called tech support and they told me to disable the security settings, but im starting to doubt what they say. so i went to change it back and i did, now my wireless internet wont connect and when i try to change it, my wired computer which i am using to change the setting keeps disconnecting, sometimes it says little or no connectivity or network cable unplugged, stop trying to change setting, internet works fine, i am stumped, any help would be greatly appreciated.
then you have bad cables, router, bum os install, bad drivers etc. it is not a simple issue to diagnose but at least we can tell where to start. the cables. try another one. bob
it stopped dropping and i set the security settings back to disabled and my wireless picked back up, do i have to have it enabled to fix the main problem?
there are people who mooch off unsecured networks to download via p2p networks. some routers will behave oddly like yours when the moochers are using your network. looking in the router logs won't help. the test i use is to leave the router set as the customer left it (insecure) and turn off all the owners pcs, etc. if we still see the lights blinking like mad uploading and downloading then we know we have a moocher. bob
