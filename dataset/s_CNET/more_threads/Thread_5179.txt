(check the manual...) --no, everything was auto-configured, totally plug and play. that's what bothers me; i made no changes to the router before the problem started. i'm not even sure how to manually input a mac address (or what it is exactly -- please forgive my ignorance!).

(check the manual...) --no, everything was auto-configured, totally plug and play. that's what bothers me; i made no changes to the router before the problem started. i'm not even sure how to manually input a mac address (or what it is exactly -- please forgive my ignorance!).&quot; i'd have to read your manual about this. what can confound us is that &quot;we&quot; didn't change a thing... but that nat address can be seen in windows xp if we open a command window (start, run, cmd, enter...) and type... arp -a here's mine. c:\&gt;arp -a interface: 192.168.0.110 --- 0x2 internet address physical address type 192.168.0.1 00-0f-3d-00-4d-39 dynamic that physical mac address may be required in your router, but i can't know this since i am not your isp. but it is one of the things i always set. bob

'block sites' lets you block sites that contain keywords that the router administrator selects. for example, i block sites with 'xxx' in the site name, among others. if you have blocking turned on, see what domains and keywords are on your 'blocked' list and remove those you want to get to. you can turn off site blocking by checking the item that says 'never', under 'keyword blocking'. you can also create exceptions to your blocking rules by putting specific pc's ip addresses in the 'trusted' list at the bottom of the 'block sites' screen center column. likewise, check the 'block services' item to see if you have this option turned on. either make an exception for services you want to use, or disable 'block services' completely. i have mine shut off completely. i rely on my firewall to block unwanted port activity.
