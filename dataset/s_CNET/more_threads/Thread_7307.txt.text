installed a new seagate sata hd in my wifes tower for more storage space, bios is as current as possible,so is windows xp. bios will not recognize hd, as i did not install sata raid drivers last time i installed new ide hard drive. is there a driver for the asus motherboard of her a600n hp tower, i can install, without reinstalling windows. only added hd for storage. computer has 2 ide hd's now, but there are 2 sata ports available minus the one for the new hd. hd is a seagate sata also. thanks in advance. 1967f100sb
step 2. so far, with no exceptions the bios must show the drive. any attempt to install drivers will only tax your time and patience. your product =  i see that you might enable a third master in the bios at  however unless you find a document with the bios screen shots, this is as far as i go. plan b. install some card like this -&gt;  but beware that many don't want to flash the bios for the ide emulation so it will work. bob
can i just switch the drive to an external with a case and copy her hard drive items she wants saved and then reinstall windows with the sata raid drivers
sorry if i was unclear. if the bios does not show the drives, no driver known has helped. which makes me ask about the document on the machine's bios. if you can't find it, why not take pictures for others to assist? why not enable the third master? bob
install the oem dvd as per instruction, follow the drive transfer section, should be less than 20 mins job
proffitt, several monthes later i finally got a chance to look at my wifes pc and installed windows 7 from a flash hd. i did what you said and looked over the other web shot you found stole a jumper from a old hd and bingo ! the drive showed up.... thanks a bunch..... and no i am not gonna kiss ya. now i will transfer 7 to the 500 and reformat the rest of the ide drives for max space. thanks again , glad /i saved this message. tim b.
