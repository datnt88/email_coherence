i'm trying to stream itunes from my desktop pc over my wireless network to my stereo connected to apple airport express. however, i can't get it to work. the airport admin utility that came with airport express is no help. does anyone know how to link airport express to a windows wireless network?
try to disable dhcp, and fill in your main router ip, gateway, dns etc. did you enable music/itunes feature (on your airport express)?
first i updated my airport express firmware and then i was able to switch the mode to client. thanks.
