i am in the market for an ehd. i think i want a 1.5 tb or 2 tb. my ? is will we be able to store several pc's files on one drive? or will it write over what is put on previously? i was thinking big because i am hoping we can store info for our 5 pc's. thanks in advance bikerart
data from those pcs as they are now and give enough extra space for what you might accumulate in the future. then, consider what you stand to lose when and not if that big drive fails. as for overwriting previous data, that only happens if you copy new files with the same names as existing files in folders on the drive and you will be asked first. files aren't removed in rollover fashion as the disk fills.
thanks for the reply. is it possible to partition the drive so we can put 4 different pc's on there? there are bound to be files that are the same between all those pc's. bikerart
data from the different pcs. vapcmd
i use clonezilla. i didn't read any manual or documentation and am able to store images of machines to such a drive with a single partition. i find partitions to vanish on folk so i shy away from that advice. but if you feel it's the answer, go for it. the cnet storage forum is testament to how we can't trust hard drives and more so external hard drives so make plans for backup and don't let it be the only place a file could be found. bob
1.5 tb drive for my wife for xmas. i took a look at clonezilla, looks a bit complicated for me. i will check into it after we open gifts. bikerart
