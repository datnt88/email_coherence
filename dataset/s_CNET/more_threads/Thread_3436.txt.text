im building a new computer from all new parts. when i plug in my power supply, the system starts without pushing the switch. the front switch doesnt work either. even with the switch disconected from the board the system still starts up when the atx power supply is plugged in. no os has been installed...is this a hardware problem like a jumper or a software issue (will it be fine after the os is installed) or can the be configured in the bios. thanks for the help the board is a biostar p4vtb with a power magic 550w power supply
the name may change slightly. in my asus it is in the power mgt section and called &quot;ac pwr loss restart&quot; does what you say when &quot;enabled&quot; i use that mode to turn everything on by hitting the switch on my surge protector. after shutting down and turning off the switch on the surge protector the system thinks that there was a power loss. when the power is restored the system will boot up. of course it could be something else.
or flawed even. imagine new system builders ire as they notice that boards had a documentation flaw. a recent flub had people connecting an ide led to the reset. over 1/2 those boards were rma'd over such. the motherboard marking was correct, but this error has been seen on many boards. you should examine the markings on the motherboard for the power on switch and consider that many can't test said push button with an ohmmeter.  and the spst switch section will give you the quick overview. bob
verify all connections are proper and routed to where they're supposed to go. in your case the frt. power sw.??? don't take anything for grnated. -----willy
