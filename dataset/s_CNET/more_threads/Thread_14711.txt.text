i wanted to buy a replacement battery for my ipod and found so many options with differing prices, models, and shipping costs, it was hard to tell which site to buy from. is there a kind of reliable &quot;consumer reports&quot; for etailers that rates them on quality of products, customer service, etc?
this is where i go for such.
i've purchased a couple battery items from a place called &quot;ebatts&quot; including a dallas chip for an old intel 386 pc's motherboard. my experience with them isn't extensive but they were very prompt. i won't provide the link but google can do it. they are still around and there retailer rating shows as a ten.
i'll check it out
