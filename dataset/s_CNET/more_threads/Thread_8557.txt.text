what is a cross-over cable ? how is it different from a normal cable, e.g. cat5 or rj45, ... and when is it used ? and what are &quot;twists&quot; in the cable, and how does these twists &quot;qualify&quot; the cable ? [all these with regard to connection of networking devices, e.g. nic, modem, router, etc. ...] thanks. christy
you have to envision the ports used by ethernet. like devices, pc to pc, have the transmit pair and receive pair on the same pins on the cable. unlike devices, pc to router, have the transmit and receive on different pins. a crossover cable is used for like devices. pc to modem or router, or networked printer use a standard cable. twists involve self induction and mutual induction of the apparent frequency of a digital signal. more twists mean less loss on higher frequencies. a simple example of apparent frequency and digital bit rate can be explained with a t-1 signal of 1.544 mb/s. the apparent frequency of an &quot;all 1's&quot; signal is 772 khz.
