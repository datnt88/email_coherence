i have an hp pavilion tx2000 laptop [old, i know, but it's been fixed up from it's previous mess and made like new and improved again] and when i flip it over i see what looks like some kind of fan. i'm not sure if it is the fan but it closely resembles one and it's right next to the vents. hot, hot air blows out when i play either the sims 3 or when it's charging, and i'm wondering if it's due to this so called &quot;fan&quot; i'm looking at. i am planning on buying a cooling pad in the nearby future but i'd like to know what i can do now to check. there's some dust inside from where i can see it and it looks like it's on one of the blades.
open up the computer and take a look. but if hot air is &quot;blowing out&quot; then it seems to me the fan might be ok.
most of these fans are quiet and generally run regardless. however, they do &quot;auto-sense&quot; the temp and will turn-on and work if idled. there's nothing to keep from general cleaning by using an air can to blow any dust bunnies. if able to more directly access the fan, do that as well. if you find the fan has actually stopped or not working, replace with similar fan. since, you're already thinking a cooling pad, get that asap. it will help if the fan is iffy operation until fixed. if this laptop is older as you've mentioned, then maybe wear&tear finally caught-up with the fan, replace it why leave thought. tada -----willy
