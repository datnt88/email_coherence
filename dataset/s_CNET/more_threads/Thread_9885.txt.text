i'm new so i hope i do this right. i built a system and can't get any kind of a display. i bought a coolermaster case and there doesn't appear to be an internal speaker to count the &quot;beeps&quot;. i guess my concern is compatibility even though i thought i did my homework when i purchased the hardware. my motherboard specifies that it is for an intel core 2 duo. at the asus website they mention that core 2 quad is supported but you have to update the bios. below is a list of hardware i purchased. i'm hoping someone can help me out. i'm stuck. i checked to make sure everything was seated properly also. case - cooler master stacker rc-832-kkn1-gp black aluminum atx motherboard - asus p5wdg2-ws pro socket t (lga 775) intel 975x atx processor - intel core 2 quad pro 6600 2.4ghz lga775 memory - kingston 4gb(2 x 2gb) 240-pin ddr2 sdram ddr2 667 (pc2 5300) ecc registered dual channel kit server memory model kvr667d2d4p5k2/4g hard drives - seagate barracuda 7200.10 st3320620as (perpendicular recording technology) 320gb 7200 rpm sata 3.0gb/s hard drive power supply - cooler master real power rs-a00-emba atx12v / eps12v 1000w power supply i appreciate any help you can give. thanks, skitlboy
got a video card?
yeah. sorry. i realized i left it out when i submitted it. i have an evga 640-p2-n821-ar geforce 8800gts 640mb gddr3 pci express x16 hdcp video card.
why? i've run into boards that need a bios update but you can only do that if you install the cpu that the bios supports. so we install a supported cpu, update the bios then we can install the cpu we really wanted to use. don't ask me why the board comes with an outdated bios... bob
so are you saying i need to install a core 2 duo, update the bios to accept a core 2 quad, and then my system should work? thanks for your time. skitlboy
only the board maker can tell you that. all i can do is share the nutty things we have to do. bob
makes sense. thanks for your help.
