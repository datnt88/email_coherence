ok, so this is a problem i have had with my net book. i can get on the internet easily, but their is a problem. one problem is that when i close my net book, and then open it up later, the internet doesn't work. the other problem is that i clearly have an internet connection, but i can't do anything that involves java, because when i try to download the newest java, it says that i don't have enough internet connection, even though my connection strength is excellent. any help on how to fix this would be great, thanks.
the java issue is likely because it's using some web installer. folk install all manner of &quot;protection&quot; which breaks these things so let's get the full java installer. the link i've given will break later so you'll have to find it again if you post too late.  bob
ok, i did that, and it let me download it. but there's still a problem. whenever i try to load something that needs java, it says error, and when i click on the error, it says this: java plug-in 1.6.0_27 using jre version 1.6.0_27-b07 java hotspot(tm) client vm user home directory = c:\documents and settings\zach ---------------------------------------------------- c: clear console window f: finalize objects on finalization queue g: garbage collect h: display this help message l: dump classloader list m: print memory usage o: trigger logging q: hide console r: reload policy configuration s: dump system and deployment properties t: dump thread list v: dump thread stack x: clear classloader cache 0-5: set trace level to &lt;n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------- load: class net.minecraft.launcher not found. java.lang.classnotfoundexception: net.minecraft.launcher
