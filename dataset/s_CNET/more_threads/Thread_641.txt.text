i have acer aspire 3000 and zv6000. someone gave me a ram but i don't know whether they are competable with these two computer. i am going to have two ram, is it ok if one is ddr266 and the other one is ddr333? do they have to be the same? thank you
mode, they must be virtually twins. in single channel mode, you can use them mixed except that the memory bus can only run at the speed of the slower [ddr 266]. thus the ddr 333 will perform exactly as ddr 266.
go to:  they have a program which will scan your pc and tell you exactly which ram to use.
