i have a dell dimension 3100 desktop that cannot power on. the power led is always flashing amber. i have tried the power supply on another dell system and it is working perfectly. what are the other possible courses for this problem.
tell something about the monitor - any messages (e.g no signal...) ? does the monitor go into standby ? do you hear any sounds, e.g. peeps, whirring from the hard disks ....when you try to bootup ? are the fans of the case/tower runing ?
your dell model, appears to have a common problem. usually, it boils down to a bad mtrbd. or in some way its not up to par. since, you've tested the psu elsewhere, that pretty much leaves the mtrbd.. though, i would reduce the system to a minimum setup and check results. if it still fails, replace the mtrbd. or if any warranty use it. if none, inspect the mtrbd. for &quot;bad caps&quot; google for pix on such for examples. also, remove all drives(unplug) and check results. other users have reported similar &quot;amber status&quot;, as you've explained. most, have been ref4erred to a bad mtrbd. at fault(usually). as a minimum setup can you see the bios display then? tada -----willy
monitor does not display any message, always on standby. no sounds at all. and no fans running.
