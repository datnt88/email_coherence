so here is the ram specs that i have, taken straight from the ram itself. brand - buffalo select pc3-10600u - 999 1gb 1333mhz cl9 1r x 8 ddr3 sdram non ecc unbuffered s/n 81017 d3u1333 - s1gbj i have 3 of those. i would like another 3. on the motherboard specs looks like i have 6 slots. i was wondering about the fact that i have 3 ram, as i thought they always needed to be in matched pairs. after reading this  and realising that the slots are for dimm now i understand that i can have one at a time. in case you want to check the motherboard is:  ? id=2958#sp so my question is do i need the same brand as the above or will any 1gb 1333mhz 1r x 8 ddr3 sdram do? can you point me in the correct shop direction? montag60
more than three gig of ram? will your os (you didn't tell us what it is) handle more than three, even though the board may? go to crucial.com and input the pc specs.
if you have a 32/bit windows, you will not be able to benefit from more then 4gig ram, if you run 64/bit i think its about 12gig ram!
