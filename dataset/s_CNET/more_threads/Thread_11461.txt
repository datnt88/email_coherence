(mistake blue-ray is wrong model for streaming video). this leaves my printer in another location, no longer connected to the wireless router i can no longer print from anywhere. the printer is located near another broadband connection and is an all-in-one that connects with usb (has ethernet option). though the cable is live, it is now presently unused. between the two wants: 1.

4160	2	376274	3211060	3211044	perflexed	1/1/10 5:35 pm	1.2623673e12	for clarification	thank you for the quick response. does your laptop have a hdmi connection or is there a cable that runs between vga and hdmi? my vga signal is not recognized by the tv. i have a request for information out there to toshiba -- i'm using a vga cable (15 pin, male both ends, to connect the two). so far no response. the printer is not something i do not want to replace, got a great deal on it and it is more heavy duty (small business vs home use). i'd rather move all equipment back if i could find an alternate way to stream movies (more important to my husband than me-- i need the office capability). i'm taking a serious look at the dell you sent the link for, thanks again.
