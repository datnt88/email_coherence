i have comcast cable with a motorola surfboard modem model sb5120 installed 6/25/2005 so it's 5 years old now. it goes to an alphashield then to a neatgear wgt624v2 router. a couple times a day it will disconnect. the internet will slow down and then some of the lights will go out. only lasts a minute or two then it will be ok and the lights will be steady. does that sound like the modem going out or a comcast problem? is 5 years pretty old? or could it be my alphashield or router?
maybe a little complain might help. if i were comcast i would definitely try to make you happy. good luck.
doing this. the modem is 5 years old, not the problem. i bought the modem so i'm not renting it from comcast. so before i called comcast i wanted to ask if it could be the modem going out which i would have to replace myself.
of course there's possibility that it could be bad. the nice thing about a router-modem can be had for about $50.
