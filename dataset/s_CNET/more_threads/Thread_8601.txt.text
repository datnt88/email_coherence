where do you find what cpu's are compatible with an asus board? i know on the asus website but where? anyway i'm just trying to find out if a pentium d925 is compatible with an asus p5wd2 premium. i think it is but i'm not 100%. plus what do you think about that processor as an upgrade for that board as from a single core. i would also like to find out what the maximum processor is that i can put in there is, within financial reason. of course that changes with time so i would like to find the list of all the processors that go in there so i can watch as the prices drop. thanks jw
here is the asus specs for your mtrbd. model:  if that doesn't make sense, then check the intel website for your cpu you wish to install and cross-reference. it seems the mtrbd. is open to both single and dual core cpus. you can use a vendor website as well to show what cpu installs to like so:  intel socket 775 tada -----willy

i don't know why but sometimes it just seems like i can't get to the same place on a routine basis in asus. like the mobo comparison chart, that site in there constantly eludes me. don' ask why...it's what u get when u cross an elephant and a rhino......elephino (hellifiknow)hehehe. i've been locked up too long. anyway this is just what i needed.. thanks guys. what is keeping the price of those extreme edition processors up so high?? 11, 12 hundred bucks hell they've got quads hitting th market now.... i want one of those ee to get below at least 5 bills....when???
you'll see the exact info on the cpu model numbers and bios versions you're seeking. good luck. vapcmd
