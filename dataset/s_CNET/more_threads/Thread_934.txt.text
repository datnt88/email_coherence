i havea 478 socket motherboard with an intel celeron d 2.93 ghz. i was looking on 3dfuzion.com and was wondering if thiswas the best videocard out there. here's the link:  thanks
but it's still not a very good card. if you really want a good graphics card, upgrade to a motherboard with a pci-e or agp slot.
3dfuzion is bfg's budget line. bfg makes 1 with a light oc on the memory and 256mb.
