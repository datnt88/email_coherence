ok long story short my employer downsized and moved their office into their basement to save costs. i moved their network from the office to basement. i made not ip changes or config changes to server. only difference is the dsl line that the network will share has a dynamic ip going into the netopia modem/router and not a static ip as before. will this work. also a linksys wireless router is connected to the netopia to provide wireless access in the house. so netopia router - linksys router - wireless pcs and the existing network netgear smart switch - 2 servers (both windows 2003 server, dhcp server on and clients/workstations assigned an ip reservation through it) - 3 workstations - 2 printers my question is how do i share the internet connection with this exsisting network setup? the servers are on a 192.168.200.? the netopia is giving me a 192.168.2.? and has dhcp server on and the linkys a 192.168.1.? i got so frustrated that i bought a wireless nic for the workstations (which already had wired nics setup to access the existing network-and working just fine) and tried to connect the wireless nic to the wireless network. that worked temp but how can i plug in manual ip etc on a dynamic dsl network? help i'm so confused and really want to learn what i am doing wrong. i'm looking for the most cost-effective and easiest route for this today. thank you so much.
i should add that the netopia has dhcp server turned on - should this be acting as &quot;relay agent&quot;? are there some settings in the netopia or the linksys that i should change?
why not try it our way? see post 17 of our forum sticky.
