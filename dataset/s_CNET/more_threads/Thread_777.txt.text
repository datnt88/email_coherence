question, shall i need an adaptor or power converter? all i see on my adapter lable is 220/240v 50/60hrz i also use an european ext hd but on that ac lable said 120/240w 50/60hrz all i used is an adaptor and it works fine.
what issue is there to solve? bob
i dont wanna blow my mouse up when i plug in the us outlet because i paid around 75,- euroos for... and i want to use that blue-tooth when i have a blue-tooth phone to tranfer things...
why no details about the adapter? such 110 to 240 or such adapters are common for many devices. most of the time it's just common sense to get the right setup. but with such a lacking detail post plus the fact it works there isn't much to comment about except missing details. bob
