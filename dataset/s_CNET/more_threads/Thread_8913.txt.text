i want to mount a rear exhaust fan on mu compaq presario sr1610nx from this site below. but dont know what size to get.  but do not know which one to get.
the grill on the rear of the case in metric (mm). there is a grill right? if there's no grill where are you going to put the fan?
just mount it where a pci card will go.
