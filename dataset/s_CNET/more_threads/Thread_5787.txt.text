so i just found out about this cpu/apu the amd a8 5600k which has intregated graphics and some guy told that when you run it in dual graphics with the hd 6670 it would be more powerfull than a radeon hd6870 is that true or was he just ************?
but with the gpu on board it has advantages. i won't duplicate the web but if this unknown pc or laptop has a make and model we could go find benchmarks to check it out. bob
i have a video he shows the benchmarks i don't understand it so it's not much use to me hope you can find some info in this
but writing a tutorial on benchmarks in one paragraph and doing it justice is not possible. it's a shame that the pc has no make or model but i will part with this. gamers are a finicky lot and won't be happy with this. i'm talking gamers. the ones that jump from pc to pc or change cards to get a few more fps. you often hear them use the word lag in less than 5 minutes. it's a great system noted there and games should be fine for that gpu. bob
