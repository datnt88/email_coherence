download these system information utilities with a working computer: cpu-z everest home edition belarc advisor run them on the old computers. they should give you good info. don't be afraid to open the case. you will need to do this anyway when you inspect the inside for dirt, dust, cobwebs, missing/broken components, bad capacitors, loose cables and cards, et al.
is a good system information tool. google it and you should be able to find a freeware download.
belarc advisor will give you a lot of information. also find device manager on your computer, it will also give you information.
