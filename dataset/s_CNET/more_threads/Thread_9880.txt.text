i have pc's, switches, router, cable modem i want to install a firewall (one of the intention is to control where the users can/cannot go) question: what is the best way to make a lan connection? pc's --&gt; switches --&gt; router --&gt; cable modem (where do i install the firewall?) pc's --&gt; switches --&gt; pc (2 nic) (firewall here?) --&gt; router(?) --&gt; cable modem or maybe i need different pc/switch/router setup? os is windows xp sp1 with most of critical update. any information or suggestion? thank you
i believe you asked this before. same answer. &quot;define your firewall.&quot; or describe the rules and features of this firewall. bob
remove the switch. connect pcs to the router, router to cable modem. configure pcs to router per router instructions install zonealarm on pcs. za will ask for permission for every program trying to access the net. router will block most inbound &quot;junk&quot;.
