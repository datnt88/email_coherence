hi all, i'm getting a low toner nag screen despite having a brand new (but purchased in 2005) high capacity 6000 sheet toner cartridge installed. have not had any luck with the dell forums so i thought i'd ask here. is there any way to get rid of the nag screen? i've tried shaking up the toner cartridge but to no avail. i did read in the manual there is a reset for the printing drum, but i didn't change that. any thoughts? thanks b
finds the usual two links. try that. bob
hi bob, thanks for the reply. i did try google and found those links but the problem is not really the error lights on the printer. those are actually working correctly and don't indicate it needs toner. it's the windows nag box.  thanks again, b
unless you absolutely need or want the printer management software, just remove it and use the driver only. you should get no more nag.
hi steven, thanks so much. didn't cross my mind to uninstall component of the software. i figured there was some reset button or sequence of actions i had to do to make it to go away. it works like a champ without the nag. thanks again to both of you. b
