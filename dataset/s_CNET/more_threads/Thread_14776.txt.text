have a belkin play n600 router with tomato v 1.28 on it. both the 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when i use them and then completely disable completely (both bands disable at same time even when i'm using just one). to get back online, i have to either turn on/off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato gui. what's going on?
try going back to stock then see if the issue is still there. many of the other images overclock the cpu or just have a bug. when the office see any of those custom images we swap in a stock router. bob
i'm afraid i'm not computer smart enough to understand a word you just said. you're saying reinstall the belkin router's original firmware instead of tomato? what's &quot;other images&quot;?
folk that install that (these are called images, roms, flash and such) usually are experts at such a thing. as it stands you have a router that no one could support. and yes that's what i said. bob
yes, i didn't install the tomato software onto the router. i got the router from someone else. thanks. i'll install the belkin firmware back onto it.
it worked. things are much better now. though sucks i can't get any ddns services except one that costs money now. may have to give this router to someone else and get a new one.
that the router hardware is in good to fair shape. long ago ddns was not done on a router so i'm left to guess you wanted it on the router. but fast forward to today i no longer need ddns as i solved my need in new ways. bob
