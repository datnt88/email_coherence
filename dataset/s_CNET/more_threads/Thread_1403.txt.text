my windows 2000sp4 does not have msconfig. i finally found it in a folder (which i didn't creat,on an old hd) xparchive. i think microsoft is doing us dirt. the subfolder was $ntservicepackuninstall$ and in that folder i found sp1. that was a good progam, i used to use it. i also checked my windowsxp pro sp2. no where on the scsi main drive or a 200gb drive which used windows 2000 until it would no longer boot. roe
i'm not sure what you are trying to do. do you want msconfig in win2k. the dirty secret is that xp's msconfig does work in win2k but do so at your own risk. you can copy the executable from xp and drop it in the appropriate win2k folder and make your own shortcut. i'm not certain, however, that win2k's &quot;expand&quot; can extract the file from an xp installation cd.
where can i find the article online in full of fast fixes--may 2005 issue--rick broida that was in computer shopper mag? thanks! ryan
