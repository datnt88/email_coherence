i have a 1st gen imac with an airport express. when i am downloading or streaming, everything is fine. however lately, i have been experiencing a major lag for a web page to come up. if i click on a link or type in a url, it take more than 10 seconds before the page even changes. sometimes it takes much longer. it's as if the server is taking forever to respond but it happens with every site and it doesn't happen on my network at the office. anyone have any clues?
and the first question you'll get is to identify the mac, how much ram and what os. be sure to post that there.
it's a 2 ghz intel core duo with 1.5 gb ram running os 10.5.5.
our mac moderator looks in that forum often.
