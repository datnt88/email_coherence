hello. does anyone have this computer (gateway 819 media center pc , intel p4 3.2ghz, 512mb ddr, 250gb hdd, 17&quot; crt screen) how does it run? do you have problems with it or is it a good computer?
i would rather get this one  it has dual core and 1gb of ram.
the above post and go dual core. my pc is 3ghz 1gb ram 250gb hdd so its similar. it runs quiet! only has 3 fans, intake, outake, and power supply. runs below 50 degrees celcious during gaming. superb tech support esp. tech chat. fast, reliable, very upgradeable, look what i did to mine in my profile. u will love it. konny
on the processor? that fan is the loudest on a pc. 50 degress celcius during gaming. with 3 fans, i can do that without a btx case. i only have 1 out fan 80mm (unlike your 120mm) and 1 pci exhaust fan. no psu fan. total 3 fans, and 1 smaller than 2 of yours, runs at 46-49 idle,but processor fan the loudest is spinning at 100%. if i had another fan, which my oem case cant accomodate without a mod, and a $10 tube of ac5, i could probably get the same thing. roger
ok here is a ''picture'' of my cooling. 120mm fan intake -&gt; 1 big(!!!) copper cpu heatsink -&gt; chipset heatsink -&gt; graphics card -&gt; slightly memory channels -&gt; 120mm fan out take -&gt; also power supply out takes the heat trapped at the top um its very quiet, obviously very cool i never heard mine run at 100% though lol.  shows a picture of the case and explains the benefits of btx. konny
from what i can determine that 819 gateway was made for the home shopping network. where are you looking at (link-url) and at what price? they seem to run from $1300 to $1500 with a 17'' lcd monitor. some things to consider: the 819 is a pent 4 3.2ghz and has the 540 series processor that does not have the 64-bit support that is in the 6xx series or the new ''dual-core'' processors that is in the 8xx series. my suggestion would be one of these new gateway computers that have both 64-bit & dual-core processors gateway model 835gm media center pc at best buy with 17'' lcd monitor & printer for $1069.97 has the intel pentium d processor 820 dual-core 2.8ghz.  or the gateway model 840gm media center pc with 17''lcdmonitor & printer and ati tv tuner & pvr for $1269.97. has the intel pent d processor 830 dual-core 3.0ghz
