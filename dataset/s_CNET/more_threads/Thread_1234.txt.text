dear all! i have purchased dv6-6119tu core i5 new...its webcam not working...
two options: 1. use the user manual or the help to find out how to activate it. 2. back to the shop to compain. either they will explain how to do it, or they will fix it under warranty. kees
the error message is &quot;can't start video. try closing other programs that might be using your webcam&quot;
so it seems the webcam might be working. it's just some program (you didn't tell what program) that gives an error message. - did you try to close other programs that might be using your webcam? - is there an error or warning in device manager for the webcam? - did you happen to run a registry cleaner or disable some services for better performance? - does the user manual tell something about prerequisites for using the webcam? - does that program work if you boot into safe mode? kees
