am using a view sonic widescreen lcd monitor and the screen atarts flickering evrytime i connect the cable wire to my pinnacle tv tuner card!!...is there anyway to solve this
and - not really clear from your post - is it a short flicker only when you connect the cable into your tv-card, or does it continue as long as it's connected? kees
it continues to flicker as long as its connected.
tried another monitor already? after that, a new videocard. then a new psu. i don't see a direct relation with the tv tuner card, alas. kees
i havent tried a new monitor yet...its a new comp,got it few weeks back.gforce 512mb graphics card....will it affect the monitor in the long run?
back to the shop then and complain. either something is wrong with it, or you're doing something wrong and then they should be able to explain. kees
been using the tv tuner for 2yrs now,just upgraded the comp...anyway will check it out. cheers
