i have a logitech mx700 that used to work in the past but now when i put it in the charger base station the light flashes red. it's supposed to be solid green. the mouse doesn't work. i have tried cleaning the gold contacts but so far that hasn't worked.
usually means battery failure.
what place has the best prices on batteries for a mouse like this? i also might try adjusting the metal coils inside the case so that there is a tighter fit with the batteries' contacts. also i might clean the gold contacts with a little dab of vinegar on a cotton swab.
