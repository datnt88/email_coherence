3030	9	576139	5377084	5376978	r. proffitt	10/25/12 2:39 pm	1.35117594e12	odd to call bluetooth in a laptop an &quot;unifier&quot;.	but your everyday bluetooth in a laptop can talk to mouse, keyboard, headset and a bt gps without any big issues. so if someone wants to call that a unifier, let's let them. bt gps units are what we call fungible. when i need one i go to amazon.com and get another one. we can get some militarized units for many thousand bucks but sales didn't happen so we just use the ones you find at amazon. plentiful, all seem to work fine so i don't supply exact models. bob

3030	11	576139	5377345	5377097	r. proffitt	10/26/12 9:46 am	1.35124476e12	so far.	we rarely use an outside the cab solution as that would have the installer drill holes and more. the simple bluetooth gps units we used are on amazon.com and sit somewhere inside the cab and get power from almost anywhere. the power draw is very low. are you writing you use your laptop outside the cab area? isn't that a bit hard to drive in winter? bob
