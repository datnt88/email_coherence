anyone using green drives here? what are the benefits? please share your experience. feel free to post your comments/suggestions as well. thanks.
i've never used a green drive, but from my understanding all it is is that it uses less power (hence &quot;green&quot;, to lower you're carbon footprint). everything else works the same just the drive uses less power.
generally, the ones i've seen with this feature have a shorter warranty. i don't know if this relates to quality standards that are relaxed in these or not. but, a drive that breaks and goes to the dump earlier than one that does not, loses some &quot;green&quot; appeal...or so i'd think. it takes energy to make the drive as well. it's only &quot;greener&quot; if the overall consumption of energy from manufacturing to disposal is less than one without that label. but earlier disposal can mean additional environmental impact and this makes it's &quot;greenness&quot; difficult to qualify.
