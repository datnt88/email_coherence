my computer is not making sound. i can play a cd and hear it but as far as listening to i tunes or a web based video no sound comes across. i have looked under control panel and everything seems ok except in the sounds and audio devices properties, no audio device is found. there are no conflicts under system properties. i have not added any no hardware or software. does anybody know what could be up? has anyone seen an algorithmic/flow chart approach to debugging problems like this? any easy way to test a sound card?
an ubuntu live cd (google that.) but read my cheap fix at  given how cheap these are, no one tests them. bob
thanks, i will give it a try
