i have an intel 2.6ghz which is working very well. my temperature is ok but i still want it to be cooler. it is always displaying 42 c and i would like to lower it. i have not oc'd it. i know that 42 c isn't a big deal, but i would like to have a more efficient fan/hs anyway. i have three case fans (two exhaust fans in the back and one sucking air into the case on the side of the same). does anyone know about a top of the line fan for my processor in order to keep it even cooler? i want a better fan/heatsink (not the thermal paste since i think that means that you can't get the hs/fan off anymore) for top $50. thank you.
charlie when you remove heat sink to put on a better one with larger fan/heat sink, the paste isn't a glue. you have to i repeat have to use it to make contact. make sure you remove old and use a quality paste. in the shop i work in i use arctic silver a very thin coating on the heat sink the size of the chip i all thats needed
well if you want to play i doubt that you can go too far wrong with these folks.  looks like around 20 bucks. i suspect you will still need the thermal paste.
after thought. what happens to cpu temp if you take the fan on the side cover (input) and turn it around and make it exhaust? a no cost test.
but does that mean that the thermal paste doesn't dry? and one more, what would be a good quality paste?
nope stays pasty:) artic silver is good but when you buy new heat sink most come with either a tube with paste or heat sink has a pad which is the transfer medium
what do you think about these pastes ? anyone that you would recommend? and then i would like to know if this is a good choice... thanks again.
in my opinion the pastes are pastes i use the cheapy silver have had no probs. and i dont know anything about that heat sink i use a stock amd recomended one for my computer
