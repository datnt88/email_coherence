hi all, i've currently beefed up my computer by installing an ati radeon x800 pro graphics card and replacing my 512mb of ram with 1gb (512mb x 2 duel crucial channel kit) however, whats seriously lacking in my comp is a new power supply. my current ps is a pathetic 300w which is making other components in the pc under perform. now, i'm no expert when it comes to buying power supplies, so i thought i'd ask you guys. what do i need to consider before buying a new one? i'm aiming to purchase a power supply capable of generating between 400-450w. if it helps, my current pc spec is as follows... windows xp home edition 2.19ghz amd athlon xp 3200+ 1.00gb ram sapphire radeon x800 pro gfx. motherboard: manufacturer : asustek computer inc. mp support : no model : a7nvm400 version : rev 2.xx serial number : mb-1234567890 system bios : 63-0100-000001-00101111-112503-nforce thanks all.
your comp will use what it needs
look here  or here  seems a 500w unit is about 20 bucks. ====================== if you have a nice fat wallet look here.  caution it's not for the faint of heart.
excuse if repeated... besides getting a 400w at least or more, you should seriously consider a &quot;quality&quot; unit as pricing pretty much separates the two. also, a build-in 2nd or dual fan setup for the p/s unit is practically a must to better handle its own heat plus any from the system. if you don't do this, sooner or later you pay the price either in a failed system, of not only a doomed p/s but possible other componets going down as well. enjoy -----willy
go with anything above 400 from antec. i have the 550  and it was not that expensive but is working very well. watch out for the specs.  may also help you.
willy, thanks for your usual good advice. my question concerns the second power supply unit (psu) fan you mentioned. a psu comes with a built-in fan and this fan exhausts itself outside the computer case, hence good cooling. if we put in a second fan to cool the psu, where would this fan go? if it were an exhaust fan, wouldn't there need to be a second exhaust opening in the case? alternatively, if a cooling fan were just pointed at the psu, that might not do anything more than move hot air from the psu to another point inside the computer case. also, there would be other fans in the case, too: one for the cpu and another for the video card (all just assumptions). all fans might just end up shuttling hot air from one to another. pc power and cooling's web site says, &quot;a well-designed cooling scheme utilizing two fans is just as effective at ventilating your case as adding 15 fans with no overall plan&quot;. how then can we come up with a well-designed cooling plan? i know this may be difficult to describe without a diagram, but can you get us pointed in the right direction?
i believe you misunderstood. the p/s units come with dual fans(already installed) actaully on the p/s unit. the push and pull as it were to better handle the p/s unit demands to exhaust its own heat build-up. the p/s itself will help vent system heat build-up but with dual fans it just gets the job done alittle better. that doesn't exclude any other &quot;system case&quot; fan(s). the system case *may* have an empty spot to install fan, use it. if none present, then use the a slot fan that mounts in a empty buss slot either getting power from the slot or actual power harness. these types of fans directly exhaust the system case plus may help vent the area next to a buss card or just the case itself. other fan(s) whose only purpose is simply to get &quot;air flow&quot; going to prevent &quot;dammed air&quot; sticking too long in any one area, like wire harness or along cards. a well placed &quot;blow hole&quot; on top of system case helps alot as heat rises, but you usually have to make a hole and then install a fan. as to the pcpower andcooling mentions, they basically say, you need a &quot;proper air flow&quot; to best handle heat situations. that's why you see the frt. case fan usually low, the rear exhaust fan, higher. the orginal p/s unit fan(s) are carry over when that was that was needed, but more importantly it handled the p/s heat venting plus any system demands. of course, we've come a long way from that, some systems do have 4-6fans installed if air-cooled. geeezzzzz enjoy -----willy
