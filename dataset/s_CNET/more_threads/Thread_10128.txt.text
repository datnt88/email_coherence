every time i restart my laptop, a message pops up after i log in saying &quot;s.m.a.r.t has predicted that hard disk 0 may fail soon&quot;. is it ok to go ahead and clone this hd onto another? or could that cause any problems with a new hd?
if your hard dive is making noise its going to fail soon.i dont think a software can predict that except for the windows one.
my question was: if i close my system to a new hd, would that possible cause any software/os problems because of my old hd going bad?
if the clone is successful then all your data will be moved to the new hd and be safe. if the clone is not successful....then you wing it...like maybe try to copy out your stuff. if the clone is successful and all your data is nice and safe then you can play with the orig hd......maker's fitness test?
