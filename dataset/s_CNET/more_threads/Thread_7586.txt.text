does anybody know if the lexmark 6150 all in one, is a dependable machine for small busines use?
if we look at the 1 or 2 year use printers that we can purchase for (in this case) about 139 bucks, the costs came down along with the number of years that the printer would give service. as months pass it will fail. months, not years. bob
which one would you suggest for my small ofice?
if you can accept that this 139 buck device will fail in 1 or 2 years, it may be just fine. some can't accept this. &quot;real&quot; copiers cost a bit more and we got 5 years from the last one. bob
