im looking for a web cam that works well with aim video chatting. i have the logitech quickcam pro 4000 but that seems to not be working correctly anymore. a message comes up saying that the &quot;request has timed out&quot;. so if anyone knows a web cam that works well with aim please let me know. thanks.
mine still works great. any way to test it on another machine? yes, i'd buy another logitech...
and it still doesn't work. i think the deal is that some webcams work and some dont. im looking at buying the logitech quickcam ultra vision special edition. any thoughts? thanks
i can't comment on the new model. see the cnet review at
