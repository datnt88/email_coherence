ok, i originally got the error 0x0000009c(0x0000004,0x80545ff0,0b2000000,0x00070f0f) and researched that error. i changed out the ram from 1gig to 512megs, and it seems to run good for basic stuff like web browsing. however if i try to start up a game it either crashes or gives me a bunch of color on the screen. i started up both sim city 4 and the original neverwinter nights. the machine is has an athlon 64, geforce 6600gt, 200gb sata hd, on a asrock motherboard. any help at this point would be greatly appreciated.
finds no single error or simple cure. it's likely something you need to take back the machine's maker. bob
yeah, i tried that. problem is i am the maker, and was hoping for some help before i just randomly start changing parts. also, it wasn't my ram as the problem finally came back with the new ram. so if anyone else has the next best guess.....???
sometimes you get lucky and find which driver it might be. then again the machine's parts are not listed. imagine the builder that didn't fit a big enough power supply. can you reduce the parts for awhile? bob
tried that, didn't get anywhere. my next move is going to be the power supply, it is older, and has a lot of things to power.
