i have been looking for a 19 inch lcd monitor but i am finding that the ones i am trying have a tendency to give off a fuzzy (slight crosshatch) pattern when there is movement on the screen (such as in games or when i drag a window around the screen). does anyone have any idea what this is that i am seeing? to my eyes, it appears as a small criss cross pattern that really is noticeable to me. any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
have to shell out some bucks. samsung and viewsonic are the best bet in my book. make sure you have at least a 600:1 contrast ratio. you'll spend between $300 - $550. there are cheaper ones out there but not for games. and life goes on... jack ps..look at cnet reviews for the best ones.
look at the pixel response rate/time in the lcd monitor's specifications/details. the faster the response rate, the less pixelation and smearing you will see. aim for 16ms or less. you will pay more for the faster rate. look at display reviews on gaming websites.
