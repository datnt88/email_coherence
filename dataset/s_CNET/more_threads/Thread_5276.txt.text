hey fellas i looking into getting a wired router not wirless, i had the wireless one for over 4 months and could'nt get it working so i finally give up on it and i'm gonna get another one. all i need is something simple i would just like to get the internet on both my computers and i got dsl internet.
i've had a befsr41 linksys router for more than a year and had no problems with it. it is easy to install and configure, just follow the instructions step by step. check it out at:
thanks man thats the one i was thinking of getting so i guess thats what i'm gonna get.
