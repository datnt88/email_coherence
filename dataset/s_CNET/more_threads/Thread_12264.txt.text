attempting to convert an mpg file to avi in order to burn it to dvd....get an error message i've never seen before and haven't got a clue about what it wants me to do. can anybody help? error message: connect video stream to tee filter it's a file on my harddrive and not being streamed via the pc so i'm clueless. attempting to just burn it straight as mpg to dvd isn't working, and i have all the correct codecs installed as far as i know. toni
transcode it to something edible by your other software with vlcplayer. bob
lol. my guess is that you have a virus and someone is messing with you.
car inspected. suspect that t is some kind of filter used to eliminate some form of copy protection [a notch filter or ??]. just wasting time. obviously robert gives the real answer.
