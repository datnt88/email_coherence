i'm looking at getting a core i7 920 and i wondering if anybody has already purchased one and if they could tell how well the stock heatsink/fan work. i've heard that they are terrible, so i am just wondering.
have been the best over the years. i think i've replaced a few intel fans where as all the others are a daily replacement in the shop. bob
typical supplied oem fans tend to work well as they don't want the warranty to kick-in within normal use. if you plan to &quot;overclock&quot; then consider a higher rated or suitable replaceable fan that's rated for such use. in most cases, just trust the supplied fan that came with the cpu. tada -----willy
