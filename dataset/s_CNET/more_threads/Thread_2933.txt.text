suddenly my bios stopped working! it will let me into the boot menu, but not the bios. has anyone experienced this problem? how can i fix it?
to help much, check the info you should give when posting for help.
i think i have an energy star bios because whenever the information screen pops up, you can see the logo, but it stays there for less then a second, so i can't read the rest of it. the problem is i can't get into the bios. it says press &lt;f1&gt; for setup, and it won't let me in. i have tried other common buttons (delete, esc) and they don't work. i am reall concerned that somthing may be wrong, and if that's the case, i'm kind of screwed.
energy star is not a bios, just that it is compliant with the rules. if &lt;&lt;f1&gt;&gt; doesn't allow you in, try swapping keyboards, i think that if the sibnals are bad, it won't get them to the computer
