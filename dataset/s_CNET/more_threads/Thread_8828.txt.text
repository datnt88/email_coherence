doesn't anyone else have the 126-button hp keyboard with the five cd/dvd player buttons along the top? i have 5 buttons in my hand and need to know which one goes in what hole. can someone please id these for me, left-to-right? i have stop, play, pause, fwd and rev. which one is on the left, which one is next, etc.? help!
would this be it? click enlarge.
thanks, ernie, but mine's not the wireless one. it's hp's p/n:5187-0341. i can find many similar ones on ebay, but the photos don't have sufficient resolution to see the icons on the buttons. i'm just going to run down to best buy or costco and take a look at a similar keyboard. even hp can't help on this one; i just can't figure out why this is so hard. thanks again for trying.
it goes stop reverse play forward eject
