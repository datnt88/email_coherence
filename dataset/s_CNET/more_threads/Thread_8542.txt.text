when i changed the black print cartridge,, the printer behaved as though the cartridge was empty and gave up faded black letters. this was an oem cartridge, not refilled or anything. what could have caused this?
what happens if you clean the contacts and then a cartridge from the printer maker? bob
where are these contacts and what do i clean them with? i did not see this in the manual, but i probably didn't know to look for it.
look carefully over the cartrigde for copper or silver contacts and here's what i do. a little alcohol on a q-tip and swab the cartridge and where it contacts in the printer. be sure to read any notes about seals you remove prior to install. i don't have your printer so i won't know if yours has such. bob
thank you so much! you are always so helpful. have a blessed day.
