(agp or pci-express cards would run a lot faster.) you should only use the drivers bundled with the card -- *don't* use ati/amd's latest drivers. your power supply is probably not an issue since the card draws all of its power from the pci slot. the amount of current in a pci slot can deliver is fixed and does not change based on the power supply.
