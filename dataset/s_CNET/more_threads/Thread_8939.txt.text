i have noticed that the audio cuts out randomly. i will be playing songs on winamp and all of a sudden when the next song comes up it doesn't play. if i hit the play button it doesn't move. all the audio then does not work for my computer until i shutdown and reboot. it is not just winamp either, which i thought at first. if i use media player, or another program, or even if i am just surfing the web. i have checked the volume control and it is still set to high volume. any ideas?

i have a dell dimension 2400. xp home edition. i don't have anything altered to the default factory settings. the situation i described is all i know, i have never been able to pin point the audio problem to a specific occurrence. i never have noticed after i do something it happens, it just seems to occur every so often. would it be a driver for the os for audio? or a driver for winamp/media player?
another driver. many think they can use a pc as delivered without worry about drivers. this is sadly not true. since you revealed the make and model, here are the 2 drivers i would install. but first, if you used your service like this...  you would see what they offer. notice how some items are in the year 2007? are you keeping up? see item 1 at  since the dimension 2400 offered three different audio cards i can't offer which driver i'd use until you tell me a bit more. bob
i have the same problem and the same machine. used to work and now i have to log off and log on to play audio. sometimes i can go a long time and other times i can only play one video or sometimes i can't even play one and no sound.
