i think that the satas are the fastest.... but wich model? and i have an nvidia nforce network adapter, can i get one that makes my internet faster?
you already have a 500gb sata 7200rpm drive so it's a fast hard drive. a 10,000rpm drive is technically faster but won't help most apps. if you're creating multi-gigabyte video files, a 10k drive may help a bit, but otherwise you won't notice the overall difference. run the speed test and tweak test at  to make sure you're getting the broadband speed you're paying for and to tune your connection.
is 10,000 the highest it can go?
