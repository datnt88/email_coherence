dear members, i badly need 3 in one (scanner, printer and copier) with an ocr (optical character recognition) or readiris, which brand and model would you recommend, an ocr is a must for my work. the printer i have now is an hp1215 psc three in one, this model does not carry out ocr. adnan
now go through those and see if those units meet your requirements. i can write that today few to none of the consumer models at the store have ocr since the consumer seems to have cooled on that being something they want. maybe you'll have to add it later. bob
omni page is one of the better software packages.  you open your scan in omnipage and click convert. that will create a text document of your scan.
