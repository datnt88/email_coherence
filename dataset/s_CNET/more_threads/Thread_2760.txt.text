hi guys, i have an emachines t6212, with 512mb dual channel ddr sdram from factory. it has 4 slots total, and 512 is made up of two samsung 256mb pc3200 cl3 ddr memory. i just bought an ultra 512mb ddr 400mhz cl3 memory which should get me 1gb memory total, but my computer is only showing 768mb memory. can anyone help?
some machines do stop there or have onboard graphics that steal ram. try  to see if you are in the zone of supported memory configurations. bob
since i installed only 1 stick, could that be causing this problem? i have a video card installed, so my on-board video is disabled.
i won't. but about the onboard &quot;disabled.&quot; that's not always true. some machines steal the memory in spite of that. here's what i do for the machines i can do this for. i get into the bios and reduce the video memory to it's lowest value. this gets us to the best place we can be. bob
you likely defeated the dual channel mode and is reportinga single channel amount and leaving out the other 256.
so, are you basically saying that i need another one of those exact same stick to make it work together? i'm sorry, i'm not very knowledgeable on this stuff.
i had that problem before.. the module said 512mb but after installing it.. the bios only stated 512mb(i had 1 256 mb module already installed).. i used another one but still with 512mb.. then i got 768.. in that case.. the former had some problems.. try changing the module to another one.. the &quot;512mb&quot; i had when i installed it alone was only 256mb.. dunno why.. i hope i am of some help..
proprietary systems, other than they make very little effort to make useful info about their systems available..
