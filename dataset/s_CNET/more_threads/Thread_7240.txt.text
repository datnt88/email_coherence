i'm in the market to buy a new monitor. i don't need any gamers stuff, but a monitor that has good contrast and brightness. i am thinking of this one. does anyone have any experience from this monitor? or even opinions. i am going to get it a little cheaper through work... thanks.
have you gone to  and looked at their monitors?? your link said that they were out of stock. i also make certain that the one that i buy has a three year warranty. here's a link to four pages of monitors.  . don't get confused when you note that the x inch wide screen monitors are lower priced than the regular x inch monitors. the wide screens have considerably less viewing area, thus the basic screens are lower price.
of inexpensive monitors that are good in the 19&quot; range. unless you have obvious resolution, refresh or performance issues, its a matter of support and price. got to someplace like frys, compusa or best buy and see which ones look good to you. i've been very pleased with i-inc monitors from  at 1/2 that price and use them in dual monitor mode at work, both wide screen and normal. about $149 - $169 after a mail-in rebate (usually).
try walmart.com they have good brands like samsung and viewsonic, very cheap prices compared to other websites like tigerdirect and bestbuy.
i got an e-mail from buy.com that was having a sale on monitors. i think it might of had the monitor you are looking at there. (i know it was a view sonic)
