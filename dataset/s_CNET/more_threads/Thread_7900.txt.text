i need help deciding on a new agp video card, and also want to know if i should upgrade my power supply. my computer is an xp, with a p4 2.8, 1 gig of ram, 2 drives, 1 hard drive, and a nvidia fx 5700 le video card with 128 mb of memory. i want to update my video card, primarly to run oblivion on less than &quot;low&quot; settings with no extremely low frame-rates. i currently have a 250 watt power supply. i want to know if anyone can recommend a video card that meets my criteria, and is hopefully below $200. i would also like to know if, should i upgrade to that card, if i would need to upgrade my power supply, and if so, to what. note: when examining the insides of my pc, i saw that above the agp card slot, it said agp slot, and also said 1.5v only. if anyone knows what this means, please share. thanks!
most big video cards that you have to plug power to, needs a minimum off 350 watt power supply. you should get a larger power supply than 350 watts. if you are playing those big high tech games get a big video card you will not be disapointed. you will notice a big difference in performance. check out the links bellow they will give you and idea on a video card and a power supply, there are many. good luck wendell h
that sounds good.... any other good cheaper power supplies? also, any other video cards that you would recommend? any from newegg? thanks!
