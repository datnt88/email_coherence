hi all, first time poster. i'm building a computer for the first time. i'm 99% sure i did it all right but alas when i go to power up for the first time, nothing happens. nothing. does anyone know what might be wrong? hardware involved: ecs p4vxasd2+ motherboard (via chipset) intel 2.66 mhz retail boxed p4 processor okia 420w power apollo devil monster 3 agp vid card (basicaly an ati radeon 9200) generic modem blitzz wireless lan adapter card sony cdrw/dvd-rom panasonic 1.44 floppy 1gb of high density ddr 2100 ram 2 extra fans and a generic fan controler cold cathode uv light ms wireless optical mouse dell keyboard i think that's everything. please help me figure out what's wrong. thanks all, john - mindwerkz
by nothing you mean no power from the power supply, no fans spinning, no beeps from the internal speaker? check the power supply voltage switch is set to the correct line voltage. test the outlet the power cord is plugged into. check the power switch header on the motherboard for the correct orientation of the connector to the switch. to test the power switch on the box, remove the connector from the header and short the header pins with a small screwdriver. if the case switch is bad this should start the machine.
first time builders often try to install everything at once. instead, a test as you go approach is a good idea. 1. motherboard, powersuppply, speaker and cpu+heatsinkfan(hsf) will get you beeps. the power switch is pushed and it usually beeps. no beeps and you are looking at the possible misconfigured or bad parts. 2. some system board come with the cmos reset in the reset position. will not power up either. bob
