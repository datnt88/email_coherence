(latest ms updates are not installed in all xps) -- that is the reason why i said its not ms updates is the culprit.-- everything works normally, then suddenly i can not browse the workgroup.. just like you described... '(network unavailable warning - yet the find command locates any computer on the net and grants access, as does the cd\\&lt;computername&gt; command.)' also printing via network is working normally. -- so its not 'file and printer sharing has been turn off too -- i would also like to know, if anyone know what is happening and how to solve the problem. thank you
