3083	6	226934	2366475	2366448	nickclark567	1/5/07 2:37 pm	1.16800782e12	acer laptop	i'm running on an acer aspire 3003wlci laptop. like i said, when i tried to update the driver, it said i have the newest version. i tried also to download some drivers from techgear's website, but i don't think that they were to run the device, they were just add-ons for more features.
3083	7	226934	2366661	2366475	r. proffitt	1/5/07 5:18 pm	1.16801748e12	gritty detail please.	you write &quot;stock install.&quot; but one owner had installed &quot;xp&quot; from a retail cd and called that a stock install. is this laptop ever had the os reinstalled? by who? how? if acer's install then i'm calling the card dead or incompatible. bob
3083	8	226934	2366795	2366661	nickclark567	1/5/07 7:17 pm	1.16802462e12	from acer	acer had xp installed when i bought the laptop last year. the only &quot;reinstallation&quot; was when i used the restore discs from acer that came with it.
3083	9	226934	2366847	2366795	r. proffitt	1/5/07 8:22 pm	1.16802852e12	then the card needs to be tested in another machine but i'd	exchange it for another make. bob
