i have an hp pavilion 513n with a 1.8gig processor. previous to my problem the computer had been sitting for several weeks. i had taken the memory out and had not fully replaced it into the mobo slot. without realizing this i turned on the computer. it beeped a lot, the power button light was on, and the hd access light stayed on continuously. when i realized what i had done, i unplugged the computer and replaced the memory solidly into the slot. since then when i boot it, i get the screen message &quot;operating system not found.&quot; when i go into setup, it shows no primary master or slave drive. it shows my memory, floppy drive and dvd-rom(as a secondary master) correctly. the computer will boot from the floppy drive with a windows 98 boot disk. it runs programs from the floppy disk without problems. i have tried a different,working hd. i can hear it running, but the bios will not recognize it is there. i have switched cables. nothing i try has worked. any help would be appreciated. thanks
try this. attach the hd and 80 conductor ide cable to the secondary ide channel. does it detect it? bob
.
thanks for all the suggestions. i reset bios defaults without any success. i then disconnected the dvd-rom and connected that cable to the hd. the computer booted fine. but then i took the cable in the primary slot and moved it to the secondary slot(the one that the dvd-rom was in). after this the computer would not boot again. in other words the cable was bad the whole time. once again thanks for the help. james
