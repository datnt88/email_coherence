i'm using direct vga to vga from my lenovo laptop to a hannspree 25&quot; lcd 1080p tv. my laptop is supposed to be able to support a second monitor, and the tv has the vga port with pc input mode. however the signal doesnt make it to the tv. when i plug in the cable my laptop recognizes theres a second monitor (i can move things off the screen) and a second monitor appears in the display settings. how can i troubleshoot the problem?
the tv doesn't do anything at all - it just says &quot;no signal&quot; no matter what i do. none of that &quot;it works then doesn't&quot; stuff. it does nothing.
be sure to check the tv setup itself to direct &quot;input source&quot; as tvs are highly configurable as well. the other half is that the laptop needs to be setup to show there is a 2nd display. since, its shows that then the signal source is lost at the tv side. i suspect you use the osd of the tv or whatever it needs, otherwise it defaults to std. signal source, like cable, sat./or antenna, get the idea. tada -----willy
