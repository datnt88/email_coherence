my son has a 512mb sandisk flash drive. device mgr. sees it in the usb port, but the computer window doesn't see it with the other drives. he can't save anything 'cause it can't be found! my system is a compaq with 2.00 intel with 768 ram. i've tried other usb ports, but it doesn't see it there either! the green light in the flash drive lights up, so it is getting power!?? he has used it before w/o problems. thanks!
os is what? w98 needs drivers for said device.
my os is xp w/sp2...i have both usb 1 and 2 ports. it's a sandisk cruzer drive..that have anything to do with the problem? thanks!
and in fact it has done so, if i read your post correctly. so something is wrong. i assume you didn't do something yourself since it last worked (like reinstalling windows xp). try to find it like this: 1. try this sandisk device in any other pc. if doesn't work there either, it's broken or needs to be formatted or something like that. 2. try any other usb device to see if it works on your pc. if not, something is wrong with your usb. 3. try another stick on your pc. hope this helps. kees
how do you reformat the thumb-drive if windows doesn't recognize the device?
