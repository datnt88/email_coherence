does anyone know if its possible to install programs on a usb flash drive? i know there is portable firefox and thunderbird, but i was just wondering if there are any others. or if there is anyway to put programs on flash drives through another method, that would be helpful as well.
there are far too many programs out there. why not narrow it down to what you need? bob
check out the kingston usb flash drive ''migo edition''. their ads say it comes with ''productivity software''
could you use the kingston migo say (100 gb) to act like an external hard drive? back up software from one pc and open the drive up with another?
the ability to copy off windows software declined to new lows in 1995 when a new version arrived. -&gt; rarely works. bob
