i have an wacom intuos graphics tablet with a serial port connecting cable, but i have not serial port on my computer. what kind of serial port to usb adapter can i use to connect the tablet to my computer? the operation system is word 7.
but let me share i've used hundreds of this model -&gt;  (the standard unit.) it's quite odd to find wacom selling serial port devices, in fact i didn't see that on their site. too bad the story and model number is missing but i can write the standard model i noted is great for serial port work. you can find that adapter at newegg and amazon as well. bob
i am sorry, my mistake. it is not word 7 but windows 7. the tablet is intuos serial graphics tablet, wacom, gd-1212-r. alexandra
around here all windows 7 i encounter is 64 bit. the news is not good. that model looks to be many many years old. bob
