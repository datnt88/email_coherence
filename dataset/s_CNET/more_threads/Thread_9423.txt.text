what is the best way to swap files between an xp pro and win 2000 laptop using a cross over cable? i didn't find where this was explained at  i ended up using a null modem cable using hyperterminal but would have liked the quicker method. the 2000 laptop didn't have infrared! thanks mike
it's a bit simple. you'll have to assign your own ip addresses like you see at  since you don't have a dhcp server, you get to do this yourself. bob
if not then set it to have a same workgroup name.
