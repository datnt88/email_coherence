workstation= intel d845gbvl / 2.6 p4 / xppro / 1gb ram-(pc2700) maxtor udma6(?) hd, updated nvidia drivers, etc. performs video / gamer wise just like a 1.8 we also have. pcpitstop benchmark says the video is performing at 52% of the same card/cpu/memory on other systems. checked direct x ( 9b). system runs ok, but checking video after processing seems very ordinary. what steps might i check-redo-etc to get to normal levels??,tia
what many discussions find is that latest nvidia drivers sometimes are slower than before. the reason revolves around the new drivers being more &quot;correct&quot; with less display issues. for example a stray line that appears on some game is now gone. cost? a little speed. bob
think over this one. if you set the video refresh rate to 60 hz, and your card tops out at 60 fps, then a benchmark like you noted could give you low marks even though it was giving you a solid 60 fps. there was no need to generate more than that. this is just one example of how a benchmark is flawed. bob
pcps is a nice tool but it's only a tool. i just ran it and it says my vid perf is 145% of similar,,,,what does similar mean?? keep in mind their running a 2d test, not much value in a gamers world. if you want to play with this go here.  get their perf test, 5.0 i think, and then a big piece of paper and a pencil as you test vid drivers, mobo drivers, bios settings and build a chart. it's great fun.
