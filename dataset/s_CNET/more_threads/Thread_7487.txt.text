hey fellas ! i have a new inspiron e1505 notebook with a dvd burner but when i try to copy a dvd i get an error which tell me the blank dvd i've inserted in the drive doesn't has the same format what the driver accept... so i need to insert a right blank dvd. the dvd driver is suppose to accept dvd-rw (i can read it on the drive) and i've inserted a blank maxell dvd-rw (i can read it on its case)... driver and blank dvd are suposse to be compatibles, but for some reason the system is saying they are from diferent formats. i am confused... what kind of dvds have i to use !! i am running roxyo creator 9 in vista home premium. thanx
all possible media types? there is no detail about your &quot;copy a dvd&quot; as to the source dvd so i can't guess what's wrong. cnet gives us the steps to copy some dvds at this link -&gt;  but i decline to expound on how that helps. you have to read the article and see if that sort of copy is usuable. bob
how are you trying to burn? if using windows you need to disable this. roxio uses this format. otherwise known as dla in dell land. what most people do is disable or uninstall it, you don't really need it and causes this to happen.
what i need to disable? and how? i am using the roxio program interface (not drag and drop) the program is suppose to creat an image in the disk and then download that image to my blank dvd, i think is the common way. i am using only one dvd driver for this. i am trying to make a copy from a original dvd. thanx for your response
roxio won't do that. the link i provided will do this. solved, bob
