anyone can i make a bootable cd for windows xp home? if so, how am i be able to do this? is there a step-by-step procedure? with much appreciation ron stebbins
it's bootable and has the recovery console and more.
i only have a recovery for my compaq and the windows xp home is before sp2. and before all the updates that i did. what i'd like to do is to put the windows folder and system files on the cd and be able to boot from it if i wanted to. i would to have the latest updated xp as my backup. i'd really like to avoid going back to xp home before sp1 with absolutely no upgrades or updates at all if i had some problem to face in the future. i appreciate your reply. i'm sorry i didn't clarify my reasons clearly. with appreciation ron
2. look up autostreamer on google and follow it's notes to see if you can create such a cd. you might, then again you might not ... bob
