11389	3	310868	2872821	2872790	arunece	10/3/08 9:00 am	1.2230244e12	hmm	but then the motherboard details mention that i have &quot;pci express x1&quot; slot available? can't i use that one?

11389	5	310868	2872826	2872796	arunece	10/3/08 9:13 am	1.22302518e12	confused man	when it comes to motherboard and naming conventions i get confused. the site read &quot;expansion capabilities - two pci conventional* bus connectors - one pci express* x1 bus add-in card connector &quot; but only after you said about x1 slot and x1 card my confusion ends. thanks bob for the super-quick response
