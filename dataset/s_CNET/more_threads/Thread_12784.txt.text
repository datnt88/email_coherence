i am very confused. i have an old atx power supply. i would like it to become the replacement for a worn out emachines at power supply. i can't seem to find the right cable or adapter i need. i did find an atx to at converter but it looked like the atx side was male and i need it to be female. plz help. this plans to be my linux learning tool
i just double checked and the electrical pins that would be on the cable should be male. bob
anything more? like where i might find what i need? what the exact name is of what i need? thx.
in your first post you wrote: &quot;. i did find an atx to at converter but it looked like the atx side was male and i need it to be female. &quot; upon double-checking i find the atx side of such a cable would indeed have male electrical contacts. but now you write: &quot;anything more? like where i might find what i need? what the exact name is of what i need?&quot; this confuses me. your first post stated you already found it? what changed? bob
