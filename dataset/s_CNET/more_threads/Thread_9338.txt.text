i have a dell inspiron 1300 notebook which i use wirelessly in the house. i'm on dsl with bell south. i use the notebook most of the time in the living room area; the dsl modem and a lynksys router which provides the wireless signal to the notebook is connected to another dell computer; a desktop computer set up in a bedroom in the back of the house. i'm on bell south dsl lite and during the day the speed on the notebook ranges from 36.0 to 54.0 mbps with a signal reading of good to excellent. last night while in the living room the speed drop to 11.0 mbps; then came up to 21mbps; 36mbps and finally reached 48.0mbps. this signal change took place while i used the notebook in the living room. could i have a defective lynksys router? if not is such a signal flucuation normal? big steve biloxi, mississippi 01/28/07
i wonder where you issues are coming from. you must have 4 or more posts with issues from here to there. maybe it's time to reload the machine from scratch, install all the heavy protection, avoid p2p or any crack software and see if the machine stabilizes. a recurring theme are nearby neighbors with wifi. just a few days ago i helped a neighbor change rf channels. and that's all it took. bob
is there a problem with my posts on a range of issues from here to there? i'm not asking for recommendations on how best to go about fixing a grilled cheese sandwich on toasted honey wheat bread now am i. big steve biloxi, mississippi 01/28/07
if i click on your profile i see many issues in the past weeks. while you are free to present them one at a time i wonder if by doing so we don't see the big picture as to a cause. bob
well then if you would take a walk over to the &quot;communications and messaging&quot; forum and check out my post in that forum and by all means be blunt. big steve biloxi, mississippi 01/29/07
