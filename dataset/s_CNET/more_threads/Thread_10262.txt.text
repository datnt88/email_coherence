my system has 1 ide port which is taken up by the boot hard drive and the dvd drive. i have a second hard drive which is also ide but is connected to the 1st sata port using a sata-&gt;ide converter. so far, i have had no problems using this system, however recently, my much larger usb external hard drive failed. in looking for a replacement, i was wondering if there would be any problems if i were to use an internal sata drive for storage as well as the other two drives. i can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work, but i thought i'd just check before spending the cash! cheers
did the external harddrive itself is bad or is it the case is bad? is this an ide or sata? personally i probably would do it this way; harddrives are so inexpensive now, i would just go and buy another one (lot less problem).
i've had a 400 gig sata drive connected to a sata and power connector using 6&quot; cables. the drive sat outside my pc. soooo, it was internal drive on the outside. no usb needed. sata is easy.
