i need a dedicated usb port on my laptop for my usb digital audio adapter. i am looking for a device that will connect to my firewire port on my laptop and will provide usb port(s). pixella offers just the opposite of what i am looking for, but the price is a bit steep. any suggestions?
that's it. bob
unfortunately this is a laptop with no pcmcia ports that are available. i may need to remove my wifi card and use my rj45 connector and purchase a pcimica usb card
this is one strange or old laptop. most come with at least 2 ports and wifi builtin. there's a thought. maybe there is a minipci wifi card? bob
