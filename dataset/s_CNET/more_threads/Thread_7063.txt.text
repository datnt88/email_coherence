hi, i'm looking for an new graphic car which must run all the new games such as gta iv, crysis2, bf3, .... and some upcoming games like gta v. i asked for a rewiev on some other forums and they all recommend me sapphire hd 6870 or sapphire hd 7770. which one do you recommend for me? my pc specs. are: i5 2500k 4gb ram 1333mhz 1tb 550w
make and model?
make and model of what?
oopps i didn't saw what do you want cause i'm new right here on the forum. i'm gonna make a new thread.
don't make a new thread. just keep everything in this thread.......that way stuff won't get fragmented. i'm looking for the make and model of the psu that is in the machine.
it should be this one.
i don't see a video card.
the 6870 is the better card. your psu will not support it. go with the 7770
