do you believe software companies will look to use usb instead of cd duplication in the future? or will they go straight digital?
even today you see more electronic delivery (the web.) these devices are for those that need them.
i do not necessarily think that all files can be transmitted via web for all scenarios which is why cd/dvd duping is out and usb drive duplicating is hot. there is a product out on the market now from hamilton electronics called the usb duplicator express which allows you to copy and pull from 15 targets at once which is a huge time save and is a standalone device. you can read more about it and purchase it from  at this link:
a recent purchase had them delivery a 4 gb download at the office. since it arrived in under a hour wouldn't your product be obsolete in today's world? bob
