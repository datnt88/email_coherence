(only 1000dpi., this one is affordable also)  (a little more than i want to spend. 2000lpi.) wacom is too expensive for the size i want. looking to spend about $100(+,-). i'm mostly unsure about how all of these will work with sketchbook. i think i like the adesso but i'm just not sure yet. anyone have any other suggestions/advice? thanks for any help.
