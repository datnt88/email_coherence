i'm sort of in a jam. i'm looking to buy a printer and scanner for various uses (printing plain documents from word processing and the internet), as well as scanning documents, photo prints, and negatives. thing is, i'd eventually like to print photo-quality prints from photographs i will scan. initially, i thought, ''well, go with an all-in-one photo printer.'' but then i wondered if i would be also to use such a printer for regular prints from word processing and such? and if so, is this cost effective? or would it be better to buy the one multifunction printer (that just prints, scans, and copies regular documents, not photos), and buy a small photo printer on the side?
yes, there are multifunction photoprinters. the difference (not always) is that they have another ink slot for the photo printing. other documents printing will use different ink compartment. i prefer to use different printer for photo.
this is just what i needed to know! thanks once again.
