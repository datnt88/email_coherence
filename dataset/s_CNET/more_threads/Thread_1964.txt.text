i ahve a wireless network in my house which has two laptops on it, and on desktop wired to it. the router is a microsoft mn-700. one of the laptops connects easily, automatically, and consistently. the other laptop, a gateway, is running windows xp pro and it cannot connect. it has an intel pro/wireless lan 2100 3b mini pci adapter. it is built-in, as that laptop has a centrino chip package. a ballon pops up saying that &quot;one or more wirelss networks ar available.&quot; i can actually pick up my own network and my neighbor's. after clicking on mine, it reverts back to the ballon popping up. using this same method, i can connect to my neighbor's, but i would prefer using my own network. i know i have the wep correct, but i do not know what else to do. i have tried to ping my router, but it fails. what else should i try? thanks in advance for your help michael

i know how to change channels on the router, but how can i make the laptop search on only one specific channel?
