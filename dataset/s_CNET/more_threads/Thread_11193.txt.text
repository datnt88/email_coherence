generic xp pc 1gb memory, video card unknown. new aoc monitor will revert to 800x600 setting on it;s own. this pc came from a business environment and did not have this issue at work. initially i thought that juno dialup was causing this. seemed to be just coincidence. any thoughts?
but why not install some &quot;resolution changer&quot; to make it easy to go back to what you want? bob
with an unknown video display, windows won't know its capabilities and will use some default settings. when you change these, they may not stick as windows will rediscover the same unknown display device each time it starts. your first quest should be to identify the display device and find a proper driver. if possible, you also look for a driver for the monitor. once everyone gets to know each other, they work better together.
i hope you have done the following: 1) load the latest and proper drivers for your video card 2) installed the .inf driver file for your monitor(if available) if this is a recent build, don't rely on what xp provides alone. the 800x600 is default for basic usage within xp and other s/w. however, if the video card(or port) and monitor each other's capabilities its a better install. i do suggest you find out the video card maker, since you provide it as unknown. here, may lie your fault, get a better driver or more complete driver set to best install it. check under device mgr. what it reports. -or- use pcwizard 2011 to get details of your system, google for it. tada -----willy
