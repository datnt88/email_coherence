this is what i have in mind. lemme know if i should make any changes. power supply: antec 550w power supply cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 4400+ motherboard:
seems like you want to your pc to be a media center pc. a cheap case that i like is the thermaltake soprano. dvd burners are cheap; $60 or less gets you a dual layer. since you have an sli ready motherboard, it makes more sense going with nvidia. if you want a tivo type thing, then get a seperate tv tuner. ati all in wonders are good since it doubles as a t.v. tuner and graphics card. they are however bad because they do have problems when you are trying to burn a show to dvd, or are trying to record a show. as i said, get a graphics card and a seperate t.v. tuner card, or an external t.v. tuner. as for the graphics card, you have such nice specs on your system that you should get a better graphics card, and also your motherboard is sli ready. as i said before, you should get a gefore 7800gt, but if that is to expensive then get this  you can also put the 6800 gs in an sli configuration.
assuming you don't need printer/speakers/monitor/media-card reader/floppy-drive/keyboard/mouse. don't forget windows or arctic silver 5 thermal compound. suggest getting new creative xi-fi extreme music card instead. get a 6800gs gfx card and tv-tuner card. 250?gb sata hd or larger. nec 3550-a dl dvd+_rw burner. other than that, looks good. case-wise, w/e you want
