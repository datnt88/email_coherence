hi guys, i come across with very wiered problem...i have a external hard drive with 40gb with two(2) 20gb partitions. both partitions are showing only 1gb or 3gb free disk space. but there is only 4.83gb on first and 1gb of data (normal or hidden) on second partition i can see and rest of the data is invisible. i have tried digital rescue to recover but it didn't help. can anyone plz help me sort out this problem as i am unable to understand the real cause...... also i remember copying some data which is also invisible..... is there any software which can look for invisible (not deleted) data???? any help or comments will be appreciated... thanks -- sjunejo
the top of this very forum in the lost and found post notes many titles. but the one i want to give the first nod to is in &quot;the lacie miracle.&quot; by booting that cd and without any knowledge of linux or installing any new software i can look at such drives and often see what is hidden from windows. but that does not mean i would delete such. many times these are recovery systems. bob
what is that suppose to mean....????
hi bob, i think you mean i should try to connect my drive to a linux pc ..... will update you if i get it through.... but, i don't remember plugging my drive into any linux machine ever....anyway let's see.... regards, -- sjunejo
if you can't find the top of this forum's top &quot;sticky&quot; post then here it is -&gt;  and no i did not write to connect the drive to a linux pc. the lacie miracle and other posts here note how to boot some linux from cd and use it without installing. it also tells you that no linux knowledge is required. bob
