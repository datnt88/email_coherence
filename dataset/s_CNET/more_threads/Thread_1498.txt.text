without spending time to pinpoint the problems, is formatting your computer an options?? have you try last known good configuration? worst case will be getting a new hd and install winxp and use ur exicting hd as 2nd hd, therefore, u won't loss any data. if really needs the org system back, spent some $$ to get a tech to solve it for u onsite or bring it in to a computer store where they have those kind of service.
system specs, we will need hwd specs or brand name and model. why did it crash? meaning what where you doing.... notice unusal start-up or shut-downs before crash? any error messages? an any new hwd or software? p2p networking, neat screen savers or toolbars? form the min amount of informention provided hard drive crash spyware/virus software/hwd conflict hwd/software conflict m/s security update conflict from pests bill
