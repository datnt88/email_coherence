6140	11	134334	1532867	1514715	kal9000	11/12/05 6:01 am	1.13177526e12	main advantages of sata	here are a few advantages to sata over ide 1. sata cables are thinner and can be longer, thus effectively improving airflow and ease of handling/neatness/flexibility in computer. 2. sata drives do not have jumper cables, meaning no fussing with master/slave/cable select settings. 3. sata transfer rates are generally higher (more speed) 4. sata handles raid better 5. most important: sata drives are supposedly hot-plugging (or hot-swapping), meaning that you can plug-and-unplug them while computer is running. most motherboards that support sata provide you with external connectors (power and data) so, if need be, you can use a sata drive on different computers just like any usb or other external drives (provided it is not the main drive that has the system installed, of course). 6. which brings us to a sata advantage over external drives: you don't need a separate power supply to use them on different computers. i'm sure that the list can be longer, but it is definitely long enough for me; sata is the way to go. regards

6140	14	134334	1536361	1514715	ackmondual	11/14/05 7:42 am	1.13195412e12	some considerations...........	yeah, many modern mobos provide sata and ide connections. at first, sata only offered marginal performance increase over ide. but i hear sata tech is getting better and better so that'll be the way to go. however, if you only have ide as of now... stick with it. it really ain't worth upgrade just that fo sata. instead, switch to it when you do a major upgrade. many months ago, i had the choice to get a 120gb sata hd over a 160gb ide for the same price. posters overwhelmingly suggested the latter citing the extra capacity would do me more good.
