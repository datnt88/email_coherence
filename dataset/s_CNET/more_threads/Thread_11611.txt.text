i bought a t23 2647 laptop a while ago. everything worked perfectly untill i found out that i had no graphics card. i used the dxdiag run program to search for my device and there it said &quot;n/a&quot; i looked around my c drive for a bit and i found ati and s3 savage drivers in my video drivers folder.... could it be that it doesnt recognize my device? or did the guy who sold it to me take it out before he sold it to me? i dont really wanna take appart my laptop but if anyone has instructions in how to do so i would unwilling look for my graphics card
at least 99.99% of them. the graphics &quot;chips&quot; are on the mainboard to save space. you found your video chipset so what is the next issue? i wonder if you are looking for the video driver (you didn't tell.) if so, it's at ibm.com or lenovo.com bob
ati:  s3:  this thread untracked
that laptop uses s3 savage graphic chip and i don't think it has any dx8/9 capabilities. thus, from dxdiag's standpoint, the laptop has no graphics card.
