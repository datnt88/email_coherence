today i installed my new ati radeon x1600 pro agp 512mb into my dell dimension 4600 to replace my old radeon 9550 agp. everything is okay except for two things. number one on my load up screen the dell logo seems glitches, the words dell are pink and green but are supposed to be blue. number two, after i start my computer or close a full screen app (eg. a game) the screen flashes for a second. i have used the ati uninstaller with my old catalyst drivers to uninstall all previous ati apps. i then installed catalyst 6.8. i am using windows xp home w/ sp2. is there a setting i can tweak or is the card defective? any input would be appreciated, thanks.
that the power supply has a 12v25amp rating generally. they say that can vary a little based on the type of cpu and number of things being powered, but thats what they suggest to begin with. even though your card is an ati, if you asked sapphire tech support thats the first thing they would tell you on an x1600 - check your power supply specs. that could be an issue for you. dont know otherwise.
direction. dont know much about all this but look at:
well i know for sure that my psu is powerful enough because it is 500w. i have no problems besides the dell loading screen being corupt and the odd flashes after closing a full screen app. it works fine in games and everything else. ill look into updating the bios. im thinking of also checking the harddrive through chkdsk to see if it finds anything.
