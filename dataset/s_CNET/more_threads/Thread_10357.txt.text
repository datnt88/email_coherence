hello everyone, which application can i use to create bootable files for usb flash drive? my old board supports usb but its award bios 4.51 did not include usb in its boot sequence. boot options are: lz/zip, scsi, cdrom, a, c, d, and all logical drives no usb boot but the mobo supports it. which software can i use to create usb bootable files to replace sluggish floppy disk or replace the zip option?
someone pleaz help!!! what is the solution for booting with usb drives on older systems? usb windows drivers make it work only in windows but not in ms dos. but where can i find dos drivers? usb drive is not available when i boot to ms dos. it is available only in windows. what can i do?
is there no solution for this problem? how do other users get around it?
your posts have been devoid of exactly what the goal was. however there are many solutions available such as dsl (damm small linux) which details how to make a bootable usb memory key and more. i can't tell which article to share since the goal is not well defined. bob
ok bob, i want to use usb flash drive as startup disk to replace the old floppy to boot into ms-dos how can i accomplish that? my award4.51 bios does not have usb boot in its menu
without usb boot capability in that bios, this is a dead end. &quot;my award4.51 bios does not have usb boot in its menu&quot; in closing, making an usb dos boot memory key is found with ease on google.com, but given your statement there's no reason to continue. bob
