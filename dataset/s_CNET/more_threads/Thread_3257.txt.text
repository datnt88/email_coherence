since you have your ssd installed has it lived up to your expectations? does it do what you want or do you find it lacking or even more troublesome than a std. hd? since, these have been out for some time and early problems resolved(i think) just are your thoughts on that? i like to exclude any costs here, just your real pc experiences. thanks -----willy
wasn't looking for the fastest around but just better boot, program launch, software updates, utilities execution and shutdown times vs. hdds. got all handily and never bothered with benchmarking. have them in dt and notebooks. no problems if fw is good. unfortunately not all mfrs support their ssds with up-to-date fw and that has given ssds a bad rap. user reviews will point out the brands that satisfy more than others. not worried about longevity; 3 yr warranties cover me with replacements should they die prematurely and i have system image backups, in case. after 3 yrs who cares, it's time for a new machine anyways; small businesses feel differently, but they shouldn't because it's a bad decision to stall due to hw wearouts. don't &quot;store&quot; data on system drives, be they hdds or ssds. therefore only buy ssd up to capacity necessary for os and apps to save money and heartaches.
it seems to be a little faster but nothing to brag about. but the price has come down abit... which is a good thing. i bought mine for $80/120gb to see just what it's like.
