i have a wd1200jb, c drive and a 40gig d, problem is local properties shows only 40g in the c, so i can't access the balance, although the proper recognition is shown in &quot;hardware&quot; ... is there a fix?
to me it appears you want to run the disk management tool in windows xp and use that space for another drive by making the remainder space a partition and formatting that new space. unless you think there is a hardware issue here i'd just prepare the unused space and start using it. bob
look under disk management and see if you see 'unallocated space' on drive 0. the fix ... you could create a new partition in the unallocated space, wipe drive 0 and start all over creating the partitions or buy a product like partition magic or disk director which would allow you to 'expand' drive c to the full capacity. the options are endless...these are the probably the most common. should you choose using pm or dd ...you should backup your data to minimize the risk of data loss. vapcmd
