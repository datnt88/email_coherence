9661	4	287100	2725400	2725370	r. proffitt	3/9/08 9:29 am	1.20505494e12	pin for pin may mean...	you will never find such a board besides the make or model you have now. the internal connections for audio and a few others are not standardized so your skill at rewiring will come into play. bob

9661	7	287100	2725653	2725404	ramarc	3/9/08 4:30 pm	1.2050802e12	there's no reason to replace that mobo	it's up-to-date. here's the link for your motherboard (mobo):  your mobo uses standardized usb pinouts. if your firewire card has an internal port, it will be standardized also. your mobo has front-panel audio port (page 1-30) and an s/pdif port (page 1-28) with simple and fully documented pinouts. if you're still having problems connecting your multifunction panel, you should replace it, and not the motherboard.
