i just loaded on vista rc2, and was all excited to try out the new vista media center with it, since i have never used media center before. vista automatically installed some drivers that were dated and signed as of 6/21 which is newer than the drivers on this page  when it loads up, the screen is all snowy, i can hear some audio from the station, and only barely make out anything. i tried to fore it and load the older drivers from the hauppauge page on, but then it said after when i got into media center that my tv tuner wasn't supported. i was pretty sure there was support for my hauppauge 500 in vista 64 anyone have any idea to help me get it working? thanks, ~j
vista rc2 is &quot;beta&quot; and until vista in whatever version does get released offically, don't expect much help from the s/w vendors until then and expect some drop-out of support as older s/w & h/w is phased out or simply no longer supported. while you may have more luck with more popular devices or pgms. as things settle down maybe all this will be cleared-up. at this point you're on your own or at the mercy of things forthcoming or not. tada -----willy
i understand that. but seeing a whole drivers page on hauppauge's site makes it look atleast like they are trying to continue to support it throughout the vista beta. the drivers now automatically load in vista after installed. i was wondering if there was anyone that might have had any luck getting it to work. i know the hauppauge 500 is a popular card, so i figure someone out there has tried it with rc2, and was wondering if they were having the same unforunate luck i have had. ~j
