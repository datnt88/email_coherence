i just formatted windows and i have been putting everything back in its place. however, after installing the wireless card drivers,there are still no available networks. meanwhile, i am on another laptop five feet away and it has a choice of two newtorks. what am i doing rong?
than a guess. i would ask how you reinstalled windows and if you added all the drivers your pc needs to operate proper.
go to the manufacturers web site for you nic and get the latest driver. if you are not able to get to the net from this machine, you may have to use sneaker net by downloading the driver to another machine and burn it to disc. be sure to get the manufacturers instructions. remember rtfm (read the manual).
