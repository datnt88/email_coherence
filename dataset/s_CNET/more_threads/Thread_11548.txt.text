i recently purchased a dell 9100 notebook computer and this baby is hot. i'm talking about the temperature. i was looking around for a notebook cooling system but the computer seems to be too wide to fit any of them. know of any cooling platforms that would fit under this dell or any other solution to keeping the thing from melting the veneer off my desk?
my wife puts a triangular ruler about 12 inches long under the back edge of the notebook. hey it works for her and it's a cheap solution.
i found i set that intel speedstep on my laptop to battery optimized and most of the time i don't notice the lower clock rate. it does run cooler. bob
a cheap solution i have found is to cut several layers of corrugated cardboard to just fit under the bottom of the laptop. this elevates the bottom and provides a heat sink to dissapate the built up heat as the corrugation acts as a heat pipe wicking away the heat. if you like you can cover the top with a layer of aluminum foil hot glued to the cardboard.
elevate the rear of the laptop away from the surface anyway you deem necessary. most cooling pads are generic or universal fit, but are better than nothing and proactive in thier task. i agree with the other posters in thier suggestions. one simple thing i do when possible, is use a 6in. personal ac type desk fan and simply blow across or directly underneath the laptop. the noise level of the fan is very tolerable and in a office enviroment, hardly noticable. good luck -----willy
ok, i am sure if you have done a minute of reaserch on these products you've run into this one but just in case you missed it..... i use the targus chill mat pa 248, usb powered double fan cooler/buffer. my laptop has an amd known as amongst the hottest. this tagus is on clearance at my local target for $20.99 regularly $29.99. there is a very similar product with slightly larger demenions that is currently a clearence item at staples (i think $19.99. i dont know the name but you will recognize it as having kinda a wavy or amorphic shape. good luck, and get on this.... you have to protect the boys or you may not ever be able to have children. staying cool casey288
hello, i would like to offer some prototypes of a product to cool laptop computers. i think it could work quite well; i will give away (5) units to whomever would like one. please email me at eric.stanley@soothsoft.com with your name and shippng address, i'll send it right out. i would ask for your feedback once you have used it for a couple of weeks. thank you.
hello, i posted earlier on 6/6 regarding a prototype laptop cooling device. i have given out a whole bunch already, and i am sorry but i have no more to give. i thank everyone who emailed me for their interest, and best regards to all. eric
seems to me corrugated cardboard would provide an insulation layer (more pieces = more &quot;r&quot; value) to the bottom of the unit, and aluminum foil would provide a reflective surface to radiate heat back to the laptop. the triangular scale, or other spacer allowing air to circulate is the only thing to do unless and active cooler (ventilator) is used. at home i just use a piece of hardboard (masonite) with a strip of wood glued to the top end to elevate the back end of the laptop letting air move and it makes a big difference in thigh temp! reply to an old post - but still current problem.
