103	7	566357	5326958	5326979	r. proffitt	6/24/12 12:01 pm	1.34053926e12	the pc has no warranty.	only the parts. sorry if that's rough to accept but this is an area that self builder often get upset about. they buy all those parts and no one will warrant the machine. just the parts. and to figure out which part failed around here is 120 and up usd. any savings are usually gone. it's a nice list of parts and it should be fine but then again i've found new builders put an extra mounting stud and short out a board. they are very upset but wiser from the experience. any reason why you are building a pc? bob

103	9	566357	5326997	5326996	r. proffitt	6/24/12 12:11 pm	1.34053986e12	sorry	but that is exactly how pcs are fixed today. someone gets to go in and troubleshoot the pc. the home builder is sometimes at a disadvantage since they don't do this a lot and may not have spares to test with. here i might debate if it's cheaper since one trip to a repair counter is 120 bucks plus parts. not one service desk i know will troubleshoot and say it's the video card. why? because if you replaced that and it still didn't work, would you be upset? this is why the usual repair centers don't take in such a request. bob
