recently switching from a pc to mac, i'm still knew to the computer. i switched because i thought i wouldnt have to worry bout the mac running slow due to excess software such as virus protection. my macbook takes a very long time to load all internet pages. i know my connection is fine because my old computer, which is about 6 years old, runs super quick on the internet. is there something i dont know. are there any certain settings i should be looking at? i feel like i should save some money and just get dial-up!!!!! i do have a cable internet connection. its wired in, not wireless, if that makes a difference. thanks in advance
what web browser are you using?
i was also having this problem a while ago. if you macbook is brand new and you haven't been using it for more than i think thirty days you can call the apple helpline, i can't remember what they did, but it certainly helped. if you can't find the number for the apple helpline, i can give it too you if you need it.
