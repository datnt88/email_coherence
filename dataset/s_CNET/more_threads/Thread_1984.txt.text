this is my first ever build, i have picked these parts for the following prices corsair 650d - 105dollars corsair vengeance 16 gb 1600 mhz dual channel ddr3 - 75 dollars corsair ax 750 power supply - 96 dollars corsair force gt series 120 gb ssd- 167 dollars corsair h100 liquid cpu cooler- 67 dollars intel i5 2500k - 179 dollars gigabyte z68 ud4 motherboard- 169 dollars asus 24x dvd burner- 29 dollars nvidia geforce gtx 560 ti ds- 229 dollars i got the corsair parts for around 50-60% off retail because i work at a retailer and corsair has a pretty nice vendor program to employees. opinions? total cost so far is a little under 1100 dollars with tax.
why the cooler?
you could save some $$ and go for a gtx 570 instead? similar to the build here for $1000
i agree proffitt. that machine will not be putting out enough heat to warrant a water cooler. unless you plan on over clocking both the cpu and the gpu, you won't need it. that having been said if you do plan on over clocking, keep it, but make sure you have fittings for both gpu/cpu. also make sure you use the same hose diameter for the whole system. no step downs or step ups. it won't flow properly if you do, and you will burn out those components.
