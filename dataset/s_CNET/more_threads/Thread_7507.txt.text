hello: when i looked at all reviews of monitors, and i then looked at all manufacturers, i noticed that there were no reviews of iiyama monitors (i have three). i know that they have no big footprint in the usa, but still, i believe they are quite a big manufacturer. how come they are not included among the many, many manufacturers on the cnet list? would anyone know? thanks, hans l
they didn't make a deal with the big stores or sites like tiger, newegg, amazon or others. as to cnet, they would have to arrange for product to get reviewed and many makers don't do that. bob
okay, bob, i do understand. thanks, hans l
