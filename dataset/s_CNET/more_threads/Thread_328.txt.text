i bought an hp psc1401 printer/scanner. the install disk requires over 300mb of system memory. talk about a memory hog! is there a way to make this printer functional with less memory usage? thanks
but i think you meant 300mb of disk space. i have yet to see the driver require 300mb of system memory or &quot;ram.&quot; did you look at hp.com for a driver only without the apps? bob
sorry about that! i meant disk space. i will look on hp's website. thanks
during the printer install, verify if you can install a basic or limited version w/o all the bells and whistles. thgis assumes, that it allows this, i know my 1350 did but i found later i wanted the full install, so again see if yours allows this. tada ----willy
