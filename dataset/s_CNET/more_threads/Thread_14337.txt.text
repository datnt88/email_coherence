my monitor shows grey horizontal lines on the screen. i connected two other monitors to my computer to verify that the problem is not with any one monitor, but the lines seem to not go away. this makes me suspect that there's a problem with the computer or hard disk itself. after my &quot;experiment&quot; with different monitors, my hard disk crashed and i had to replace it with a new one. the grey lines are still present on the screen even with the new hard disk. does anyone know what the problem might be? thanks much,
many load windows but forget that the drivers are rarely supplied. we have to do that ourselves.
if not the drivers then the video card maybe going bad. john
might as well go shopping... ^_^
