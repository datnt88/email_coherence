not sure what i need in a new computer. run microsoft office, put photos on hard drive, make music and photo cd's, use flight simulator and other types of software with designing, cookbooks, etc. also use zonealarm for firewall and virus protection. i really only need a new pcu. i have a hp pentium 4 1.6ghz speed, windows xp home, 128 ram. someone told me about atholon vs pentium processor - don't know which i should get. also, what type of graphics card should i be looking at? main reason for change is that flight simulator runs slow and the scenery could be better.
you need more ram. 128 mb is not enough to run windows xp. buy 512 mb more of ram. you don't need a new computer for what you're doing. try this website. crucial.com
depends on what available slot u have. i run ms flight simulator 2004 on max stuff at 1280x1024 with an fx5200. i agree with adding at least 512mb ram. for gfx card...if u have an agp slot, u can pick up a nvidia 6200. if only got pci, i would recommend getting a nvidia 5200 or nvidia 5500
