i am trying to access data on a usb external hard drive (western digital wd800u017-001). the data was put on with a mac. i am trying to access it with a pc. in device manager, i can see the drive. in disk management, i can see the drive but it has no letter assigned. when i write click the only options available are delete partition and help. it will not let me change drive letter and paths. if i try to use the diskpart utility from command prompt, i can see the drive with list disk and list partition but not with list volume. if i try to use the add or create volume simple commands i get a message that says &quot;the command you selected is not available with this version of windows.&quot; my computer is: windows home xp + sp2 amd athalon 1500+, 512 mb ram, asus a8v266-e motherboard usb 1.0 it is six years old. any ideas?
one other thing i forgot to say was that the drive has no name. no name appears in disk management.
sorry, i found the solution here:  something to do with a corrupted registry key. i can see it now. i can't access the data but i can see it in my computer at least. thanks.
to access the data i found a program called macdrive. it has a free trial for a week but its pay after that. the free trial is plenty for me but does anyone know a freeware program that does the same job? thanks.
the website to get macdrive is
