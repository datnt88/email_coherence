3751	9	345067	3056637	3056467	3rdalbum	6/6/09 3:22 am	1.24425852e12	so much misconception	&lt;&lt;if you want to run your web browser, your email client, your word processor and view your latest photos, you would want a quad core processor to run these four independent tasks.&gt;&gt; better yet: why not buy four computers? use one to run your web browser, another to run your e-mail client, another to run your word processor and another to view photos? the reason: it's a waste of computers; you can accomplish those tasks simultaneously on one computer. same principles apply: you can run a web browser, e-mail client, word processor and image viewer and all those tasks together will not even use 20% of one core. if your programs have a single thread of processing, and you only use one at a time, then you will benefit from the higher clock-speed of the dual-core. if your programs are optimised for multiple cores, or you have a number of intensive operations happening at the same time, then you will benefit from a quad-core processor. it's that simple.

(nothing to do with overclocking)

3751	14	345067	3056951	3056637	zouch	6/6/09 12:56 pm	1.24429296e12	not so!	please remember that the original poster said that he or she was relatively new to this issue and so simplifying a complex subject is appropriate. what you are forgetting is dispatcher time - that cpu power used for no useful purpose than task switching. in fact, just loading up the four applications i mentioned fires up 48 processes, i.e. 12 per core on a quad core cpu or 24 on a dual (on average - another over simplification). assuming you didn't start the applications just for the sake of it and you want to actually use them, it is very easy to saturate a processor even allowing for the gross inefficiency of the ia and windows designs. if all applications are actually doing something, the dispatcher will be making frequent task switches as tasks enter wait states and interrupts to request restart. in principle, you are halving these dispatcher actions as you double the number of cores. clearly, if you are idling your machine at anything less than 25% busy (mine work for a living), a uniprocessor will probably do the job assuming a reasonably low degree of serialization. between 25% and 50%, a dual processor would be indicated and anything over 50% will benefit from a quad core. these numbers, again, err on the side of simplicity, the level of serialization and the performance of the peripherals can apply a significant variation. your suggestion that 4 computers would do the job is flawed, if the aggregate capacity is that of a single core machine. the benefit of a quad core over 4 single cores of equal capacity is that it is unlikely that all four cores will peak at the same time, so a busy core, given an average level of parallelism (like the case above) can &quot;borrow&quot; additional capacity from an idle core, which can't be done in the separate ia machine environment. now, if you were to move up to ibm z series mainframes in a parallel sysplex, then your argument would be valid - a tad expensive for most of us, though! have a good weekend!

'processes' tells you all the &quot;actual programs&quot; that have been launched by the operating system and by each application you run, as well as the tasks started automatically on system startup. please notice, you don't have to start any applications for your computer to be running lots of processes! now the 'performance' tab shows graphs of a. percentage use of the cpu, and b. total used physical + virtual memory. if the %cpu never 'pegs' at 100%, you don't really need a faster cpu or more cores, and the &quot;i have more cores than you&quot; is just a sad rerun of the &quot;mine is bigger&quot; game. if i were a 'gamer' i'd never get any work done (and true gamers will never have 'enough' speed), but i can easily 'peg' my %cpu rendering a 3d scene or video. uh, i think i'm writing a book now, so let me close by saying: this is a great thread (short of the book i'd write ... your answer is within, luke.
