(note: if your router includes wireless, be sure to read the articles on cnet.com regarding securing your wireless router). a switch does not include the intelligence of the router, but if you already have a router, then a switch is perfect for adding ports. a switch is a &quot;layer 2&quot; (in the context of the osi model) device, and while it does not contain the intelligence of the router, it does provide high throughput for the devices that are connected to it; kudos to you, you got the right box! at home, i have a switch, connected to a belkin pre-n wireless router, connected to a linksys/vonage voip router, connected to my cable company's modem. i also have a lightyear voip router connected to the vonage router, and it all works just fine together: network printing via konica-minolta magicolor color laserjet ethernet printer, two ip phones, 4 laptops, 2 windows desktops, 1 linux desktop, and an audio/video recording studio system. hope i've helped some... -woody fairley
