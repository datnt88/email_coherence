(serious)	so, here is my problem. i bought a asus n6600, and it ran fine for about a day, and then basically anything 3d heavy looked like this:  i thought it was the card, so i sent it back, and recieved a new one(same model) a week later. no change. i can only assume its my computer, since i tested it on my friend's computer and it was fine. what could be the problem? a friend suggested it was overheating, but whenever i check, the gpu is always under 40c, usually the same for the cpu. this is really starting to bother me. what is causing this? i have a p4 2.20ghz, with a gig of ram. my motherboard is a gigabyte ga-8s650gxm (i can post full spec report if needed) also, yes,i have every driver posssible and everything updateable updated. please help!
