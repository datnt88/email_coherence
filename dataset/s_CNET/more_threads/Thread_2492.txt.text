i looking to get a new motherboard, most likely with an a socket. what cpu is the best bargain combined with performance?
need proposed use, approx budget, and whether this is all new or part of an upgrade. vapcmd
the e6300 has much better performance than anything else at its price. for $110, the athlon xp 3800+ for $70, the athlon xp 3200+ if you have already have a compatible socket 775 mobo, the pentium d 805 dual core is a bargain for $85
