recently purchased new lcd flat panel and needed digital connection so purchased new graphics card - nvidia mx4400 by asus. installed card fine, no problems. in last two weeks have had crashes. first one said drivers bad for card and not acceptable to windows, so went to nvidia site and installed new drivers, had problems but finally got all working again. crashed again tonight with following windows error &quot;stop 0x000000ea thread_stuck_in_devise_driver (q293078). finally got computer back up after three false starts of quitting in mid load and shutting down by itself. choose go to last known good settings and finally got back up again. do i have a defective card?
y did u get such a junk graphics card? i would have went for the nvidia 6600gt
just wanted the cheapest card with digital output. guess it may be a problem. even tried going back to old card but couldn't get it to work as it was still recognizing new card even after deleting drivers. any good suggestions??
at what resolution are you running it at and the refresh rate, could be that your card cannot handle or the heat is causing your comp to crash and after 3 shut downs, it cooled back down? roger
the error message has a ms notation. the ms q-number shows your video driver is stuck in an endless loop. also shows this mostly happens when symantec pc anywhere is installed. first off, i would completely uninstall the video card and drivers. reboot and reinstall, being sure to disable any anti-virus (and pc anywhere, if it is on the machine). probably things are out of sequence. also,lcds have a native resolution. you don't a lot of choices like a crt. good luck. chuck
running at recommended for monitor - 1280 x 1024 at 75 hertz. was running at 60 hertz and didn't see any difference once i upped it to match monitor's recommendations.
am going to try the uninstall tonight and disable norton av and zone alarm, but have already tried reinstall 2x's.
