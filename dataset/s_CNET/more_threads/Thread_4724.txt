(note: i also tried to set up wep but same problem) other info: wireless system uses nsw 2005 antivirus along with aluria adware software. any thoughts on what's going on here and how to correct this? i talked with netgear and they said drop all firewalls and uninstall the software if necessary. call back if any problems. (once i get the issue fixed i'll be ready to review netgear products for all to see)
