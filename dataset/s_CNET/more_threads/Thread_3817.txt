(well i guess that's two questions. ) thanks again. i'll check back in to see if there's any other advice and let you know how it works out. matt

538	6	316642	2910810	2910494	geliqian	11/19/08 5:23 pm	1.22711538e12	hmmmmmm	perhaps my celebration was too premature. i ran generals again and it froze. i wonder if it's a card issue. or if i haven't really disabled the integrated video or the driver sweeper program is a bust. any ideas? i still am not sure how to disable the bios video. a side note in case any one has any ideas. i still can't install age of empires 2 get's to the 51% and stops installing. it can't be the disc because i have two copies and both give the same results. matt

538	8	316642	2911552	2911422	geliqian	11/20/08 10:33 pm	1.22722038e12	update	i think i got the bios figured out. and have the onboard disabled. i didn't find the items you told me to look for but i found similar items in these menus: advanced&gt;chipset&gt;internal graphics&gt; under int. gra. it lists primary video controller = gfxo-gpp-igfx-pci, uma framesize buffer, surround view (this i disabled), amd 780 hd audio, display port config (this i disabled), 1394 controller. so i think i got it disabled. as for the hdd i have uninstalled generals and defragmented all drives that needed it. was some nice defragmentation. i have yet to reinstall generals so i will have to wait till saturday afternoon. you think my install issue might be one of the ram sticks? hmmm i'll have to try that one on saturday as well. this is where i stand for the moment. i'll check again on saturday, and update as i go.

538	11	316642	2913683	2912144	geliqian	11/23/08 6:29 pm	1.22746494e12	update	it just stops installing at the 51 percent mark. task manager shows it as running. and i can click the cancel button. i tried clicking on the start bar and it didn't have anything pop up at me. it just stops at the same picture each time. with a trade market and text about trading in the game. usually is the same bunch of files. arialni.ttf i notice the cd drive will rev down. and the led will stop blinking, almost as if the drive stopped reading information. i know this hardware will run it because i installed aoe2 once before with vista. i guess i could try installing it to my external hard drive. but i don't think that would work. i haven't tried the ram yet. i figure i might as well. darned if i know what it is.
538	12	316642	2913778	2912380	geliqian	11/23/08 10:06 pm	1.22747796e12	update	hmmm that's a thought. i will try that. but as for now i have tried the ram idea. no go. still froze. even tried moving to the external harddrive. still no go. i'll see if i can roll back the driver. matt
538	13	316642	2914370	2913683	voodoodan	11/24/08 3:11 pm	1.22753946e12	re: update	hey matt you mentioned xp sp3 above; i am afraid that i have gotten so used to vista, that i am unable to recall what the latest xp 64bit service pack is. what version of os are you on, and is it 64bit? as for the game itself, what is the exact version that you are trying to install? as silly as this may sound, i would recommend checking to make sure it is not an expansion pack, but the full game. on a similar note, i was wondering if you are running antivirus software. if so, disable it and try the install. i looked up install issues with aoe; thought you might find this link helpful, as it sounds like they are having the same issues as you are:  . hope that helps. let me know how it goes.
538	14	316642	2914447	2914370	geliqian	11/24/08 5:43 pm	1.22754858e12	update	no i'm running 32 bit xp i'm trying to install the full version. and generals is still having issues. grrrrrr. i wonder if i should just try getting a radeon expansion card.
538	15	316642	2914457	2914447	geliqian	11/24/08 6:01 pm	1.22754966e12	update-success for aoe	okay, slap me upside the head. i feel foolish. i just took a look at the link that you gave me. when i did i read something about a win98 issue. gave me the idea to run program compatability wizard on it. ran it. and retried install. works. i just installed it and it went on cleanly. i got as far just now as the menu. . i wonder if that's my issue with generals. except i thought that it would support xp. i'll give her a try.
538	16	316642	2918121	2912380	geliqian	11/30/08 10:40 pm	1.2280848e12	still have problems	i am still having the game freeze with generals. i don't know. i have tried everything we've talked about. i just wonder if it's a hardware problem. guess the only way to find out is to get an ati video card. oh also i'm having a problem with a couple other games. dark reign, and caesar iii both i believe are from win 95 era, but i know the hardware will support them because i've been able to run them in vista, however xp won't. i think it's because i have sp3 on here. but i just thought of one other thing i can try.
