it's my dad's laptop and his hard drive failed so i wanted to upgrade to a ssd, upgrade the motherboard, and upgrade the memory. i have about $500 to spend can anyone help me decide what brand to buy? i want to make it as fast as possible and possibly play a few games and download movies and music etc...
i had the intel ssdsa2cw160g3k5 320 series solid state drive - 160gb, sata 3gbps in mind. is that too much would a 120 gb be enough?
like you used to own a desktop. laptops don't have interchangeable motherboards. you can get ram from crucial and i like the seagate hybrid drive (won't break the budget.) bob
