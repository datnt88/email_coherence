12264	3	554561	5268513	5268425	steven haninger	2/1/12 4:58 am	1.32807228e12	i see you've posted this before	and were answered by one of the most knowledgeable people here. his advice was to do as you are asking here. about all i can find is a suggestion that something called &quot;iwave media player&quot; can handle that format. it also seems that the extension isn't unique to the voice mail program mentioned. i've found plenty of hits using google to search for converter programs for that format but none seem like solid leads. my guess is that you may have already explored many of these sites already. i don't think i can offer much help here but thought knowing the file format might be useful. good luck in your efforts anyway.
