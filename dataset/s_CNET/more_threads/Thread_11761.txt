11846	4	305160	2836976	2836622	t26l	8/18/08 3:08 pm	1.21907208e12	ok	ok here is what i want to do. it's not a complicated setup that i require for our uses. i have this network (4 computers, one wireless) all behind a router. a dlink dir-655. the vista machine that is having problems has no 3rd party fw and the windows fw is disabled. i just want to be able to access it's shared folders from all of the computers in the network. i don't particularly care about giving each computer (user) their own permissions per folder, etc. just allow every computer to have full access to the folders. i have not created a user account on the vista computer because that creates an entire folder system as well as seeing their login icon on the scren during bootup, for each user on that computer which is what i want to avoid. in the past, i have simply given each computer the same workgroup name, and after that, and folders i would share on any of the lan'd computers would be able to access the folders.
