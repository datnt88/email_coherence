hi all, i'm currently running windows vista home premium 32-bit on an intel duo 2.2ghz with 2 gigs of ram. i recently acquired a panasonic tx-26lxd50 tv, with the intention of using it as my primary monitor so i could play wow on a larger screen. i've connected it via a scart to s-video cable. the problem is that the setup for my graphics card (nvidia geforce 8400gs) informs me that i can't have a resolution higher than 1024x768 on the tv, which is rather blurry and not very easy on my eyes. i've tried updating my graphics card driver (which did allow me to choose 1440x900 for my -smaller- monitor, but not the tv... i also tried using powerstrip to force a custom resolution, but if anything that's worsened the problem. can anyone possibly help me to fix this, or even just inform me that what i want to do isn't possible and i just wasted money on a tv i don't need? :p
sorry, bummer. bob
should i have used something else?
which do not make good monitor use. i think the rgb might make better connection for computer use.
dvi or hdmi different vid card(s). dvi would give you video only, you would have to tap off for audio, hdmi would give you both. your computer specs are a bit light, however and you would likely, unless you already have, need to upgrade the power supply, assuming this is a storebought puter. plus 2gb of ram with vista will just get you by with 32 bit system try to run 3gb, if possible.
yes pal might be a tad lower or higher depending on how you look at it, but at 480 lines the screen should be only good for playing a dvd. bob
