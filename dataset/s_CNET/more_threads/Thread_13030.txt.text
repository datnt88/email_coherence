since external hd's are pretty inexpensive - most are around 150$ it seems like the quality should be a big factor in which one you buy. which external hd is most likely to last the longest. is there a best brand or any difference between brands. is it true that an internal hd will generally last longer then an external one, why is that? thanks
there is only one drive. those in external cases are the same as those used in pcs. only the case is different. i have several hard drives, all &quot;internal&quot; used in external usb cases.
seems like internal hd's have maybe a 50% chance of lasting longer then 4 years. while external hd's dont seem to last as long. maybe that is because of wear and tear, but an internal hd is used much more then an external one.
let's take our cars down bumpy roads or smooth roads. same cars but do the roads we travel result in more or less failures? this is true in portable drives. think it over. bob
