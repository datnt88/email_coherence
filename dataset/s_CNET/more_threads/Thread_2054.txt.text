i'm trying to find out if i can install two video card on my computer, one of them is a ati radeon x800 xl and i also want an a ati hdtv wonder with a tv tuner, my computer runs windows xp sp2 and 1gb of ram and has pci slots for the upgrade, i want to play some good games on my computer and also i want to record tv programs on it, thanks for the help, miguel martinez from jersey.
assuming the x800xl is the proper slot type (agp or pci-e) for your mobo, they'll work together just fine. be sure to google some hdtv-wonder reviews/discissions since it had a lot of issues when it was first released.
thanks for the tip.
