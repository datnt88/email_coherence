i've always had epson printers. generally, i like them, but.... they have a problem, which is actually mentioned in their manual. you have to use them regularly, or the heads clog up! i want good quality b&w & colour printing. acceptable photo printing.... pretty much all the things any home user wants, but what i don't want is to attempt to print something & find the heads are clogged because i didn't use the printer for a month or so. i've never seen this issue mentioned in printer reviews & was wondering if anyone has ever tested various brands for it? i would love any suggestions as to what printer i could buy that would not require me to use up trees pointlessly, just to keep it running.
back when we couldn't afford color printers we went to kinko's.
hewlett packard would be my choice, there are many from which to choose.if you want an all in one, the hp 6380 would be a good choice. good luck!
when you buy a new inkjet type prtr. stay away from epson models, they tend to clog all too soon vs. other brands. you should look at canon or hp models and find what suits you. whatever, for more $ look into a laser prtr. there are several in the low cost area and will not be effected by clogging issues. provided its use is basic and general(home use, right) it should provide long term usage and overall be cheaper to operate, though initial cost is higher. even now at this time of the season, you're bound to find great pricing on lasers. however, if you find ink better because of cost, i did mention, laser. again, many a prtr. is being at good pricing now, so look around. remember, cheap is cheap, so beware. tada -----willy
thanks everyone for the advice. my personal experience certainly bears out the clogging issues thing with epsons, so i'm thinking it's time for a change. i will certainly check laser prices, but as i said, i don't print all that often.
