are pixel shaders and vertex shaders required for games? i want to play left 4 dead, but their is one problem. vertex shader ver.: required - 2.0 , i have - 1.1 pixel shader ver.: required - 2.0 , i have - 1.3 can i run that game at all? i understand the game performance may be bad but i am willing to change some settings. so my question is, will the game even start up, even if i lower the settings? thanks
i could find the game's specs but i got nothing on the pc you wanted to run it on. yes, you told a little about the pc but no make, model and if you replaced the video card, what is it?
my bad, here is a copy of my dxdiag report.
left4dead requires a dx 9 card with pixel shader 2.0. your ti-4600 lacks these features and the game will not run on your pc. you will need a geforce 6600 series or higher or radeon 9600 series or higher video card.
time for a better card. here's the list i like -&gt;
