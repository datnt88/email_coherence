(some computers, including my office machine, have raid0, or striping. this divides data between two hard drives, supposedly making read and write operations faster. again, i think the benefit is marginal on the desktop.) you should have a backup routine for your data. at home, i copy my data to a second hard drive; at work, to the server. you could combine your backup routine with an imaging program, such as norton ghost. an imaging program allows you to take a picture of the hard drive, which you can use if your hard drive fails. but the image is static. so you need regular backups as you change or add files. i considered installing a raid setup when i built my home computer two years ago. i intended to use it for backups, but i decided raid was inadequate. my advice is: don't bother.&quot;
