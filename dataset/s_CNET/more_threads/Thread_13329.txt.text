mdl#wd32001032-001 that i aquired minus d/c pwr. supply? w/d site doesn't list drives by mdl.#. need model type,and need correct volt./amp rating for pwr. supply and i am clueless on erasing/ formating unit to get to &quot;like new&quot; status.on a limited budget so all help really welcome!
cheap and likely less bucks than a power supply.  notes other methods but there's a few cheap housings at newegg.com and geeks.com your model number didn't turn up so i'd just chuck the case and recycle the drive. bob
i &quot;cut&pasted&quot; your md# and *only* got your query as an answer via google, so either that model# is wrong or you have a very unique wd product. i suggest reverify the model#, etc. and recheck with google or any search engine and see what pops up. i have found wd to be very helpful on thier support website on all products. maybe type there under thier search button nd check results. otherwise, open wd wenclosure and see what decal in on the wd drive itself. you can as robert mention buy a new enclosure or an adapter(if applicable) to mount to desktop and get any data, again if possible(not a true hd failure). ok? tada -----willy
hello: i have the exact same drive. i left home without the power supply. did you ever find the correct voltage and current? you are correct that the wd web site is useless for this. they claim the input is 110 - 240 volts, which is obviously not what we need to know.
it appears they outsource the build of these things so one source will be one design and the other source will be another. so they don't care what the power brick is as long as it consumes their drives... bob
a/c input = 100-240vac 0.65a max d/c output = 12vdc 2a the power pack does not state the polarity however, the power pack model no. = da-24b12 make = apd (aisian power devices inc.) hope this helps ;o)
