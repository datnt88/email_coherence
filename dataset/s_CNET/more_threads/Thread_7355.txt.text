i'm planning on purchasing a new desktop. i've always had custom made pc's in the past (for gaming etc). i'm now past that stage but i still want quality and speed. i plan on basic cable internet surfing/photo and movie edits, multi task etc. (no tv turner). i probably will get a dell or hp with vista home premium. my question...to avoid hour glass should i get 2 meg ram and forget about video card/ get 1 meg ram and a video card/ or go for it and get 2 meg ram and video card? i'm not getting a new monitor but would like to stay in the $1,200 price range. any advice?
to change the icon to something other than an hour glass. even the latest and greatest pc will show that if the internet is downloading something. but back to reality. i bet you meant 2 gb (gigabyte) ram. that's nice for vista. don't get more than that on 32-bit os based machines. as to the video, i'm going to peg it at 256 mb for desktops. -&gt; the really big item to look for is a dual core cpu. hope this helps. bob
yes i did mean 2 gig ram. any advice on best company for desktop dell/hp etc? not sure if some of them use lousy motherboard,burners,etc. will size of power suppy matter, perhaps 350 watts?
the price we pay for these drives is under 40 bucks and get 2 or so year lifespans. most accept this because when they lasted years the price was in the hundreds of dollars. because of such low prices the highend models are never seen today. as to make i use the dell without issue at the office. the retail hp/compaq aren't so bad either. bob
