i just bought the coby mp305-2g mp3 player and everything works fine but when i plug it into my usb to transfer songs, my 3 1/2 floppy disk drive keeps checking for a disk until i remove the mp3. i looked for solutions on the web but haven't found anything useful. this really gets annoying and isn't normal at all...how do i make this stop? thanks i appreciate your help! pat
clear recent documents. if you forgot how, google or bing that.
thank you but it still does not work when i do this
some newer pests jump onto machines due to a vulnerability. so let's plug that gap. research autorun eater. free over at download.com
i tried downloading autorun eater, installing it, ran it and the ran my mp3 player...it detected an autorun but then i couldn't use the software to transfer music ect...
it appears their software is causing this. now take this up with this device's tech support. do you really need a floppy drive?
