pc screen goes black. after using my pc for a bit the monitor goes black as if the pc has been turned off. this then means i have to reset the pc as as ctr alt del does nothing. there is still power though. any ideas? ta
you want the internal temps under 50 degrees c. if it's getting too hot, this can happen.
given only this much detail it's either in need of repair or what digger did at link to follow. bob -&gt;

i've seen so many bad ones in the past few years. how old is that thing?
not sure as it was not me that bought it. i will need to as my nephew as i got it from him.
sorry but i would be guessing this pc is a collection of parts from near and far. i don't have much of a story but even with no story i'll take a stab at this and what stood out is a card that has failed in droves. it seems to match up with the symptom as well so why not swap in any other card for a test? bob
it did it again tonight. there was a audible click from inside the case then the screen went black.
