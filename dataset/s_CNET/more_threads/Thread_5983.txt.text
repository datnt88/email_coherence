i'll try my best to make sense of the situation. i have a brother laser printer which i have connected to my router wirelessly, and a desktop connected to the same router via ethernet. yet, when i go in windows to add a printer, it cannot find it. i have the drivers installed, and it works via usb. any advice? thanks.
your desktop doesn't have wireless capability unless you install a wireless slot card or use a usb adapter.
ah, didn't know that was necessary. thanks.
it varies with the model but most require you to setup the wireless printer first (not on your pc!) then i install the printer driver and then it knows to look on the network. at no time do i need to add wifi to the desktop. bob
i tried that the first time but it didn't work. after reading your post, i reset my printer and connected it to the router on the printer itself and my non-wireless enabled desktop discovered it immediately. thanks!
wireless to connect to your printer. as long as the printer is connected to your router and your computer is connected to your router, either by wire or wireless, you are golden......as you have already discovered! p
