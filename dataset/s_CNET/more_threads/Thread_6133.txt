6008	5	62902	754177	751486	jcrobso	2/10/05 10:10 am	1.1080302e12	got everything but ram and hdd	i'm assuming that you got the amd64 processor. the ram and hb in the previous post is a good choice, if you want a bigger hd you could get a 160bg. in order to keep up with the cpu drr 3200 is the minium speed. john
6008	6	62902	754552	754177	hobbes	2/10/05 12:31 pm	1.10803866e12	re: hdd	you will want to get a hard drive with the longest warranty possible. i try to aim for 3 years. though last time i checked most have dropped their warranty support to one year. and to get a &quot;serial&quot; hdd and cable. though that won't be hard since &quot;serial&quot; has taken over the market. you could try to get a hdd with 10,000 rpm, though i'm not sure if such extra speed is necessary. the 8mb buffer is nice. two other considerations. scsi/raid. both promise faster performance and both add considerable cost to your pc(especially scsi)
6008	7	62902	754568	751486	cv4stm	2/10/05 12:47 pm	1.10803962e12	ram and hardrive	if u still wanna get really good stuff, go with the: ram- kingston hyperx pc3200 400mhz (4x512mb) harddrive- seagate 160gb 7,200rpm 8mb cache the hyperx is the best ram that the best ram company offers. i have also heard lots of really good things about seagate harddrives.
