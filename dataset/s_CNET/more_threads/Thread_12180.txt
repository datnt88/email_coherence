(i also got a floppy with dell dimension vxxx/vxxxc a08 flashbios but as long as floppies aren't read it's not of much use.) i reseated the memory chips earlier to exclude that they were causing the error but it didn't change anything other than the amount of memory being counted. suggestions? is there a point in removing the cmos battery again? ct

9840	6	573196	5362502	5362143	ctlarsson	9/18/12 3:23 am	1.34793858e12	found reference manual	and dusted it off. inside was an explanation of the four led and the status they had indicated &quot;the microprocessor has failed a bios test.&quot;, not very uplifting. anyhow, i took your advice and identified one single jumper, also mentioned in manual, and moved it to maintenance mode. voila! the computer started and displayed a maintenance screen. i set the date and time, saved and exit. moved the jumper back to normal mode and restarted. guess what? it resumed operations as before. it's strange though that the date-time setting can cause such boot problems. but i'm happy that it's up and running, cause setting up the same peripherals on another computer would have been a challenge, even with the backups. thanks, i'm much obliged, c-t
