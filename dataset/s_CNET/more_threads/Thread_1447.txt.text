hi, i'm new to this forum, but i really need to find out how important the gpu clock speed is regarding graphics cards. i'm probably either gonna get a bfg nvidia 7600 gs oc 512mb card which has 420mhz clock speed or an xfx geforce 7600 gt xxx edition 256mb card which has 590mhz clock speed. both cards have a memory clock speed of 800mhz. can anyone help me with deciding which one would be better? i think the one with 512mb would be better but i honestly have no idea how important the gpu clock speed is. any help is much appreciated.
a gs would need 100mhz to be close to a gt.
well yeah, it's got a higher speed, but the slower one has double the memory. i mean, i do intend to play quite a few games using the card i'm gonna buy. should the amount of ram i already have affect the decision i make about the graphics card? i should have 1.25gb ram by the end of the week...
512mb is only of benefit at very high resolutions (1600x1200, 1920x1200). a 7600gs (nor the 7600gt) aren't fast enough to handle games at those resolutions. you'd need a 7900gtx to really take advantage of 512mb.
yes... but a 7900gtx is a tad outta my budget.. say if i had to stay with the 7600 series, you're recommending the 256 mb with 590mhz rather than the 512mb 420mhz? i suppose it is a matter of the card being able to use all the memory sufficiently.. i'd need an agp version as well, i don't have pcie slots. do you know any good sites for graphics cards?
dude, for pc hardware and electronics, you got to go to newegg.com. they have some of the lowest prices, they are fast, and their customer support it outstanding.
ah yes, that site was just recommended to me earlier today. tell me, what do you think of the gainward bliss 7800gs agp?
