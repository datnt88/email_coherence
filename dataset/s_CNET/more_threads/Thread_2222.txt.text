as most of us know, dell cannot recommend third-party options for upgrading any hardware - thus the hardware that comes with it remains... however, i have heard that you can replace the existing psu (power supply unit) with a third-party one (such as a thermaltake, antec, etc). however, i have also heard that such psu's are not compatible with the dell motherboard. which of these are true? i don't want to ruin my system - thanks. btw, i have a dell xps 410
they offer some psus for dells.  vapcmd
not yours!!! so i'm sharing i can use atx psus with the 24 pin adaptor or in my case the standard 20 pin atx without issue. mind you i've done my homework so i have zero issues here. bob
so r. proffitt; just to clarify, you can use a third-patry atx power supply on your dell btx motherboard? the key is &quot;dell&quot; because some of their parts are proprietary from what i heard. okay, so just to clarify, you have a dell?
just another btx. btx is a standard so i know i could use the atx supplies however you must do the work to see if the dimensions work for your dell case. bob
