i currently have 4gb of ddr2 ram, and an ati radeon 4650 hd, and i wanted to know if i can upgrade it to 8gb ddr3 ram or stick with ddr2, and also, to what gpu can i get the motherboard to. i have a 2.33 ghz quad core, and my power supply is a micronics 230w. i play games such as the ac series, tomb raider amongst others, high motion games. 2 hours ago also, i want to know if i will need to upgrade my power source
i'd say do nothing. there are posts about which list to check but in this case not only would you be in for a new gpu but without a new psu i'd not touch this. i'd leave this alone. bob
but if i upgrade my psu to say, 500 watts?
because you might get some dual or triple rail psu and that would be no upgrade.  is the usual list. and look at the rating needed and then again, unless you know your amperes, you get a single rail of the rated value. bob
so i guess it's better to buy a new pc than to try and improve my current one
but it won't affect frame rates in games. if you found this old pc with say a 5400 rpm drive, for cheap i could fit a 7200 rpm drive and the improved boot and load times could have the owner happy for a bit. the 230w psu is just too low to consider any card on the list. and without knowing which 500w you have so i can check rails, i can't be sure it will do. that's one reason why you hear folk asking for a single rail. bob
