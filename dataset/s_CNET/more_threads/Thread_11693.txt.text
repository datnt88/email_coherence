in a surprise move (to me at least), sun computers has adopted the amd 64-bit cpu.  bob
robert, i would think that &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; is very much a key factor here for the consumer. new software is expensive.
with having a bridge to run 32-bit code, this is a chip to watch. as to expensive, the cost for the os is the same when that day comes and as to other applications, we'll see. already, open office has started to dislodge that other office. cost? check it out yourself at  bob
bob; have you purchased or tried an athlon 64 as yet? prices should be getting 'right' this coming spring. i'm going to wait to see what ms has to offer with the 64 xp before making the plunge, but in any case, plunge i will ere another year has passed. ken
i have learned to bide my time on such things. i have already put aside any idea of upgrading any machines that we don't have to in anticipation of the changeover. i already see the price plummeting over the past month and xp-64 may not be what we'll be installing for these workstations. in the case of the next setups, it's open office and some development work in c++. since it will run windows 2000, we can do that with a dual boot to some linux-64. bob
