hey mates all: i was watching a film on the net and all of the sudden,...black screenn...blue screen,,,and gone without allowing me to read the message in the blue screen...i couldn`t believe it ,since i have a p lv, 2.4 ghz, 1.00gb of ram,amd athlon (tm)64 processor3800+. windows xp professional.sp 3.all my hardware are compatible with xp,the computer have been working fantastically for a year,since i put it together myself. all that i can think of is the psu,,,why??because the keyboard is on in num lock,but the mouse is not on,when you powewr it on it just go as far as the booting operating system screen,it wouldn`t go further...any ideas ,,pleaseeeeee?
in the bios if you can get that far. if all looks good in there, make sure you are set to try to boot from cd/dvd drive first. then try a live linux cd or ultimate boot cd and start check devices for a failure. it could have been memory or a heat build up or just a hardware failure. if you can boot into one of the above cd's more than likely you can find the problem.
thanks mate,i`ll do it and let you know...
