does apple or amazon still sell the black macbook with 512mb ram and 80gb harddrive becuase i can't find it on either websites thanks candice
apple no longer sell that version. they have upped the processor speed, doubled the ram and increased the hd size and all for almost, if not exactly, the same price, as the one you were looking for. p
thanks
