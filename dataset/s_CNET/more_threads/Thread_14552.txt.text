good day, i am building a new pc and i purchased an aoc lm760 lcd 17&quot; lcd. however it has a d-sub connector only and my video card has both vga and dvi-i connector. the package contains a dvi to vga adapter. my question is will my lcd show an improvement once i have used the adapter to the dvi-i rather than the vga connector. i know that some lcd's do the conversion from analog to digital within their electronics, however in this case will the lcd know that it is a digital input it is connecting to or will try to use the analog circuitry. will i see a difference.
the lcd will probably auto-switch to the proper input. if not, enter the menu and manually aim at the appropriate input.
as soon as i hit submit, i finally understood your question. you shouldn't see any improvement using the dvi connector with a dvi-vga adapter, so just plug the monitor directly into the vga (analog) output.
