997	2	61514	729760	729740	irishman	1/31/05 5:00 pm	1.1071908e12	work group and domain	the workgroup names are both the same. i pretty sure that i didn't set up a domain in the first place. just a refresher put what is the domain again.

997	4	61514	729934	729881	irishman	1/31/05 6:37 pm	1.10719662e12	workgroup right?	well in order to do that you would have to be able to view the workgroup computers right.(i think) well thats when i get the error message. it comes up when i click &quot;view workgroup computers.&quot; i came home and i did what you have just explained wheere your click on the name and click on properties so i think i know what your saying. i am going over to their house tomorrow to look at it again
