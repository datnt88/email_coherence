i am beginning construction of a gaming pc, however i am not &quot;up to date&quot; when it comes to hardware. does anyone have any suggestions?
1. i'm sure you read the following. &quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines. &quot;  that answers the cpu question fast enough. 2. the current gpu list today link follows.  3. ram. 4gb to start, 8gb is nice, for bragging rights, get more. bob
