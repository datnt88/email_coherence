experiencing repeated paper jams. i have thoroughly inspected for any obstructions and have plenty of paper in the feed tray. the paper feeds ~ 1 1/2 inches before jamming and i have to remove the paper by removing the back cover and pulling the paper out backwards. any thoughts are appreciated.
while you can try rubber renewal products (see amazon.com) the repair usually and always costs more than a new printer.
are you saying the machine itself has a life expectancy of two years? if so, why doesn't brother disclose this and further, does this apply to any make and model of an &quot;all-in-one&quot; machine? what specifically are you referring to when you say rubber renewal products at amazon.com? thanks
you haven't lived through the years of thousand dollar dot matrix printers and the move to lower costs and shorter life spans. your reply is one that i'd expect from today's newer owners. this assessment and statement is what i apply to all &quot;consumer&quot; printers. the business class machines fare better but you don't see those at the retail venues. here's a rubber renewal for you -&gt;  read the comments about this product. bob
