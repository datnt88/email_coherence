&quot; +12v1@21a; +12v2@22a&quot; a page calls for a minimum 24 ampere connection and your current psu does not meet the minimum. bob
...please consider one of the psus (first three) listed here .
i think i have solved my problem... i bought a never used 700 watt psu...it has a 56 amp singale rail 12 volt.....i was told by a few people that this should fix my problem.....i have it runing just fine, and should be a good long term fix, it seems that i will play high demand graphix games and they play flalessly for like a half hour, then once every thing worms up to proper temps(still very cool for an avrege) considering i have a nasty tt water cooling sys,the game seems to run a little chopy...even with my cpu over clocked to like 3 ghz safely,,,,my procceser runs at like 110 deggres f(ruffly 30-32c)....im not quit sure why...but yea any idea why this might be?
