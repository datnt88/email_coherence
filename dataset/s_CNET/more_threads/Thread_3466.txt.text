is it possible to have 1 wireless keyboard control 2 pcs at the same time? say i type on the keyboard and the things i type come out as tect on both pcs. if this is possible, how would i go about setting it up? i would buy 2 wireless keyboards, and set up the 2 recievers, but is there a way to set them to the same frequency? i have never owned a wireless keyboard so im not sure if this is possible or not.
wireless keyboard only works for one pc at a time. you can however move the usb thing that comes with the keyboard to another pc and use the keyboard from there.
you can't operate 2 pcs simultaneously but you can install a kvm switch and use 1 mouse and keyboard with multiple monitors and pcs. check with your local micro center or comp usa or best buy or radio shack.
i was wondering about kvm switches and had a few questions about them. i was told i could only have my monitor, keyboard and mouse all hooked up at once. from what you were saying i could only have my mouse and keyboard hooked up and keep my 2 monitors. can i just only hook up my mouse and keyboard? if i can just hook up the mouse and keyboard, what is the delay between switching from one pc to the other?
using a kvm switch you can operate 2 computers using one keyboard,monitor, and mouse(...kvm). however, i don't believe you can address both units at the same time( at least in my experience). you use a hot key or manual switch to toggle between desktops. if the two machines are networked,you can of course move files between them.
you can have 2 pc's with 2 monitors controlled by one keyboard and 1 mouse. the speed of switching depends on what kind of kvm you get. there are kvm switches that can work with ps/2 or usb keyboards and mice. the ps/2 kvm switch switches between pc's faster than the usb version (1 second vs. 3-4 seconds) because with the usb version, the pc you switch to has to re-recognize the device vis usb.
multiplicity? look here  and find out if it suit you. works for great for me
