i have an 80gb usb iomega hd hard drive attached to a windows xp desktop. i purchased the iomega in part because i really liked the iomega backup program--automated, worked in the background, reliable. i have no trouble transferring files to and from the hard drive. but the iomega backup software works once, maybe twice, and then gives an &quot;error starting backup&quot; message. sometimes going to the control panel and using 'repair program' works. but more often it doesn't. this is not what i'd call hassle-free backup. does anyone know what might be going wrong? i'm running zonealarm and avg as well as adaware; could there be a conflict with one of those or is the iomega backup software just problematic?
&quot; is the iomega backup software just problematic? &quot; i've yet to encounter non-problematic backup software. it's always &quot;something&quot;. as it is that way, i've developed my own backup methods such as written at  this is not an iomega backup web site, but just a general discussion forum so all we can do is share our experiences and if we are lucky, find a cure for such issues. if you feel that the iomega software is buggy or needs fixing then the only place to go is ... where you suspect. hope this helps. bob
the iomega site is naturally the first place i checked. the &quot;support&quot; offered there is nominal, and they definitely aren't making it easy for customers to get in touch with them. i like your backup method; it's similar to what i've been doing since iomega backup has been misbehaving. it would make life easier, though, to find a program that would synchronize a specific catalog of files with the backup folder. i have a list of about 15 folders and several individual files that need to be backed up frequently, and selecting them individually is a pain.
it can ease such a system... bob
