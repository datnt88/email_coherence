hi there, my additional keys on my keyboard is all mixed up, the usual ones still work normally, but the media keys, hot keys, and the f-keys are all mixed up into each other, such as when i press stop in the mdia keys, it turns out to run previous track, and when i press itouch, it turns out to be decreasing the volume. pls help as soon as possible. if any info were needed, pls say so, i'm using win xp pro
you'll have to master the logitech software and assign keys as you want them. bob
the problem is, the software is kind of screw up as well, i look at the instructions, and it tells me to go a particular place, which is imposible to get there, becoz 3~4 tabs is missing. anyway, i have the exact problem and the same key changes as this guy after playing cs.
if logitech can't make it work, all i can share is that i also don't have a ready fix. but i will share that my lessons over the years taught me to never install logitech mouse or keyboard drivers. bob
