2268	5	363105	3147138	3147066	deniceels	10/11/09 12:59 am	1.25522274e12	i am running a far older machine of 10years	and, all these while gave the internal fans (even the psu) a good clean by dusting it away out from the cpu. sluggish to me, but not freezing until i start running heavy duty stuffs like photoshops with mp3 playing and video watching simultaneously which are tolerable to me. the few things you can give it longer life are: 1) updates for graphic card... your graphic card will already have new updates which will unfreeze 2) motherboard updates - bios, drivers.. lookup the manufacturer's manual on how to do it 3) updates for windows - especially drivers and directx. stick to 9 if possible as 10 may not running smoothly on older cards 4) autostart programs - some programs you installed may put one of these little fellows.  have some good utilities which you can use, but do it with caution. 5) game/programs - newer ones will require newer hardware specs. stick to those within the era of the hardware, unless it's necesary to have new ones. exception will be the security s/w. again,  have some good reviews on these guys, especially in relations to hardware requirements. hope it helps.
