i currently own a dual-1ghz g4 with a geforce4 ti 4600 256mb and i want to upgrade it to something else. can someone put some light on what my options are?
not many cards compatible with mac, perhaps a 9600mac or 9800mac edition, don't know exact specs. roger
the nvidea and ati web sites. they are about the only ones making cards for the mac and they are very proud of them. your current card is up there with the winners. for anything much higher than what you have, you need a g5 processor and an 8x agp slot. btw, it looks like nvidea shows your card with only 128mb ram. good hunting p
