i found a dell xps 400 with dual pentium d and a 128mb graphic card. it was going for $550 buy it now. is that too good to be true or did i fing a good deal.
...for fear of getting scammed. you never know who you're buying from.
if they want money via western union or contact you outside ebay then it's the usual scam. bob
if they seller has tons of feedback ratings (1,000 +) and a good rating (i usually look for 98.5% or better) though then you may be safe. the trick is to read the auction carefully, and send a note with any questions. if you do not get a response back that is sometimes a bad sign. i have not purchased anything as expensive as a pc off of ebay, but have bought 60+ things over the last 3-4 years and have not had problems yet. but i think if you use paypal they have something where you can get the 4 back i believe.
...that's not very convincing. i'll only buy a computer if i can see it running 3dmark, prime95, and other intensive apps.
if you don't ensure that a windows cd with a valid product key is included, you will end up adding us$100 to your final cost.
