hi all, appreciate, if someone could please advise me, at what price will i be able to sell my lenovo ideapad s9e which i bought in june'09 for &#8364; 320.00. thanks all.
the best thing to do is to check the price for a comparable laptop at the usual second-hand sites in your country. a three year old netbook without warranty can't be worth much. if it's the cheapest one i see it has: atom n270 processor, 512 mb, 8.9&quot; screen, 80 gb hard disk, xp home, 3 cell battery (the original one). let's say 25 euro's. maybe 50 but not more. kees
hi kees, thanks for your reply. i had browse through and could not find any comparable lap tops in any irish websites. it has 1gb hd memory. thanks.
the model/make does not have to match to be one you are comparing. bob
