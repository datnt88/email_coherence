i'm having some problems with my system that i suspect may be related to my power supply. the power supply itself seems to be in its last days. when i start the pc up an electrical noise is noticeable coming from the supply. plus the computer is increasingly witnessing a repeated problem. what happens is, the screen will suddenly turn off and go into the power saving state (because the graphics card stops sending a signal to the monitor), then immediately comes back on and the picture is all scrambled and the computer becomes unresponsive all together. i don't believe it is the card itself because if music or such is playing when it happens the sound will also cut off, so i think the entire system freezes. i also am unable to overclock the motherboard (even a little bit) since the system locks up after a minute or two after it boots. this also points to a power problem. so is it actually a power problem or is it sometime else i may be overlooking? pc specks: amd athlon 64 3500+ geforce 6800 gt windows xp professional 1 gb ddr ram 2 120mm fans 200 gb seagate sata hard drive 450w power supply
the oc'ing limit is probably the biggest indication. ummm yeah, i'd say it's your psu. what brand is it? konny
since this seems to be a newer pc, at least from the processor stand point( amd64) how old is the psu??? with your symptoms the first thing i would do is swap out the psu. a good 450w supply should handle your pc. but $35 450w psu may not. john
