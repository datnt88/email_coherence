a friend called me up from texas asking for help - his floppy disk has changed to read only. i assume he has winxp but that's all i know.
read only tab. it's on the corner of the floppy case. open the file(s) in explorer, click properties, uncheck the read only button.
my friend has this to say: i have tried many things, but no results. the latest is to select the flopy, click &quot;properties&quot; and at the bottom of the page i see three boxes as follows; 'read only' - &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot; archives&quot;. usualy the read only is check, so i clear that and try the other two attributes or none . an &quot;apply&quot; box appears and i check that, but nothing changes. do you know how i can get rid of the &quot;read only
do a google or microsoft search on &quot;take ownership&quot;
