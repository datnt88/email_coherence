help.... i'm trying to check my hard drive for errors but the scan disk doesn't complete. it keeps cycling back and starting over. i tried to defragment as well, but that gets about 10% done before re-starting with a message that windows is writing to the hard drive. i'm not sure what that means. how can i fix this? little help please.
check other posts for this issue here is one that may help.  usually the best bet is to start up in safe mode and run scandisk from there.
hey i have the exact same problem so if you get it figured out please let me know how to fix it thank you p-pratt@sbcglobal.net
