i currently have an asus amd a8n-e motherboard that only supports ddr ram. i have 2gb of 400 mhz patriot ddr ram. if i decide to switch to intel's new core 2 duo processors and, accordingly, replace my motherboard to an intel-compatible one, would i need to buy new ddr2 ram for the new motherboard? or can i use my ddr ram in the ddr2-standard motherboard? it just seems like a waste of a lot of good, fast ram. thank you.
(most that is) seems flange a does not fit into slot b. what waste? you could sell your old system. bob
however there are some mbs that indicate accepting ddr and ddr2 and the intel core 2 duo cpus. as always ... read the specs carefully before buying ..esp the part about ...will your ddr ram work with the new mb. vapcmd
you would have to check the specs., but i belive that the mobos that support the intel core 2 duo only accept ddr2 ram. but check the specs..
intel core 2 duo cpus, ddr or ddr2 and agp or pcie. vapcmd
