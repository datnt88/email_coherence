my tdk 880n internal dvd burner has been acting flaky....gets hung up alot when i try to access it, or try to read data off a disc. are there any tools commonly available that i could use to test the drive, before i take it out and replace it? tia ss
i can clean install linux in under an hour and see what k3b thinks of it. however this is reserved for personal works since tech time per hour is more expensive than a new drive. bob
do a &quot;backup&quot; of enough files to fill the dvd and &quot;restore&quot; to a new directory &lt;dvdtest&gt;. if there are problems with any of this, trash the writer and get a new one. bob is right, it would cost you more for bench service than a good dual-layer dvd writer. and life goes on... jack
