i am using a 10 year old gateway 2000 for a carputer. it only has 130mhz processor speed and 64 mb or ram. i have no idea of anything else about the computer. i am trying to install 2 hard drives in the computer. both have correct jumper set up. one is master and the other is slave. the computer boots up and shows the hard drives in the start up but when i go into the system setup it shows the drives as d: and e:. i want them to be c: and d:. it also will not let me format the drives or recognize them when i try to partition them. any help would be greatly apprecited.
these old machines had limits to what drives they identify. details were missing from your post, but at the 133mhz area, i ran in problems even at the 8gb mark. bob
sounds like a win95 machine.. in which case.. its probably not worth upgrading. even a 98se machine is going to have problems with increased hardware on this chasis.
i am installing a 8gb and a 2gb. the 8 gb was in there already. i am replacing the original 1 gb with the 2gb. i am planning on running win95 because thats all that i have laying around. but it did already have win 98 before i started.
just need a topic... such old drives may have odd (to today's users) jumper methods. some drives had a slave present jumper. but without exacting details i can't guess you missed the jumpers or what type ide cable you used. then again, the 2gb drive could be dead. it is certainly past the 5 year mark. bob
