i'm looking for a new power supply for my pc, and i've found loads of psu's that have one fan at the back and one at the top. the problem is that i only have a hole in my case for a fan at the back. would i be able to have a fan at the top of the case with no hole? or will it just blow hot air around and be pointless to buy? any help is much appreciated.
when the psu is mounted in a case, that fan that you think exhausts to the top of the case is actually a bottom intake fan. to help us confirm your problem, please post a link to that particular psu model.
often temperature controlled in speed to run only as needed. agree with linit's. simply look at the pattern of the mounting holes. only one way to install the supply because of the one mounting hole that is offset. a simple form of keying.
yeah, it looks like the second fan is suppossed to point downwards. thanks a lot for the help.
