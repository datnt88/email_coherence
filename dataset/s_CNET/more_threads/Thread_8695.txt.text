well, it's that time of the year to format and redo for me. my usual back up drive is a wd passport usb 80gb drive, i use it constantly. today i was dumb and formatted it and tried to install leopard on it and couldn't get it running. so after that i try to go back into windows and format it so i can use it as a backup again and it didn't show up in my computer. i did the obvious and replugged it in and got an unknown device what ever, so i told it to look for drives but it couldn't find any. at this point i'm freaking out, so i pull up device manager and see the unknown device, but it's also under disk drives, working properly. i then plugged it into my xp desktop, works like a charm, shows up, works fine, read/write/copy, everything, so no problems with the drive. i think i've cornered it to a driver problem in windows, and don't know what to do now. anyone have an idea?
installing windows on your mac requires a special procedure and only certain versions will install. if this is a pc then this post is heeded to be locked since we can't discuss pirated material. bob
no, i have windows under bootcamp on my mac. i was using the drive with time machine and to backup files from vista.
we have a great moderator that can address this there.  -&gt; beware that external drives in fat32 will go missing for a very simple reason. fat32 is not damage resistant. bob
