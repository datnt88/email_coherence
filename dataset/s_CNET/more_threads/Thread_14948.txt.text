i have had a problem with my nec3500 dvd writer for the past week. occasonally it will open when the computer has been off for a while but after 15-20 minutes it becomes unresponsive. i was wondering what would cause this problem?
maybe the drive is going bad? also if/when it locks a disk inside the little hole on the front, about the width of a pen tip you put a paper clip into that and it will manually eject the drive thus releasing it's circular hostage (if you don't quite get what i'm talking about...plz ask b4 trying)
1. heat. many stack such drives in some hot and stuffy case. try this. pull the cover off of the case. 2. software. uninstall incd, roxio's directcd or other such and see if that cures it. a known issue. bob
i have similiar problems. make your dvd becomes a master in secondary ide.
