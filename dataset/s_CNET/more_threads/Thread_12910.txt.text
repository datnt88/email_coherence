my router must of fried or something because i can connect to the network through my linksys (befw11s4 wireless b) but i cant connect to the internet. is this problem able to be fixed or my router dead? and what could cause this?
to see if an internet connection exists. modems go bad as well.
try unplugging the router from the power source then plugging it back in again. are the connection lights on the router lit? and, it may not be the router but your isp having some connection problems.
i did unplug and replug the modem and the router countless times. same thing. i have plugged the modem into the computer. i got the internet. when plugged to the router everything seems to worl fine. i get all the lights, i can access my network, my laptop gets a signal, but the internet doesnt go to my desktop or laptop.
you may update the firmware as a first step in troubleshooting. from inside the setup program you can check things such as: 1) mac filtering (on or off) 2) dhcp status 3) user names and passwords if required by the isp 4) dhcp client list 5) dhcp release and renew buttons has this router ever worked with this setup?
i updated it when the last update came out some time last year. those settings i never touched i let it go on its own and it worked fine except for now.
is to swap it out with a known good one.
