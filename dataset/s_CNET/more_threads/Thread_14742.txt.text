if you live near a bestbuy, this lg multi-format burner is only $60 and a very good drive:
i was confused about this &quot;half height&quot; i thought it was a &quot;special&quot; type that i had to purchase the same replacement type in any brand so long as it was half height. don't know what half height is.
there are some slim drives intended for use in laptops, but the rest are half-height.
thank you very much. it was very confusing to me since when i search for half height only a few show up. i do have a best buy close and i think your suggestion is great.
