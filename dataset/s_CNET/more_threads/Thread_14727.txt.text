is this the way to do it? what works best for the wireless computer, expansion cards (nic) or usb cards??
watch the video at  you are duplicating what thousands have done before. maybe this is your first network but be assured that it has all been done before. bob
just making sure i don't need a switch (what ever that is) and other components.
inside your common router.
you add a switch if you have more wired pcs than you have ports. a switch takes the place of a pc, and more pcs plug into the switch.
i like your map. i make maps of everything - cable-a/v rec.-ps3-tv hookups, etc. even the cables and splitters from my driveway running to the attic and all over.
