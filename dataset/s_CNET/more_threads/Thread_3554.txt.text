hello, i have a linksys wrt150n router. i've had it for well over a year now and uptill now i did not have any problems. recently i tried opening a website that i frequently visit but it said &quot;network timed out&quot; i had afeeling that it could be a problem with my router, so i connected the modem directly to my computer without the router and the site loads up perfectly. this has happened to multiple sites i visit. does anyone know how to fix this? thanks in advance.
we have suggestions that we start with such as settings and firmware.  shows there are a few versions. but 1.01.9 dated 7/11/2007 looks to be the latest. some routers have block lists. check yours. bob
thanks for your responce, but i have tried everything including firmware update and resetting the router but nothing helps..
so it's setup per our forum sticky? in that case the router is defective and needs to be replaced. i can't repeat the forum sticky with every post so i have to take your word it's setup that way. bob
