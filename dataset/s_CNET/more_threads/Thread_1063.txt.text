i am running on windows xp which i have recently re-installed using a windows xp install disc not supplied with pc. windows installed ok but my video card in not detected. directdraw and direct 3d are disabled but have no option to enable. cannot play any video type games. any advice please? my pc is 'tiny' no disk and did not set any dates to restore to so cannot restore to factory settings. help!
have you installed the video card drivers? i assume that you have installed all the windows xp service packs? motherboard chipset drivers? latest direct x? give us your system spec's & let us know what you have installed & we will be glad to help. good luck
you also need to install drivers for the video card. if you don't have a cd with drivers, you can download them from the website of the card's manufacturer. ie: if it's an ati card, download drivers from the ati website . if it's an nvidia card, download drivers from the [url= website[/url.
