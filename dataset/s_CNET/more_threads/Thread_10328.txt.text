i'm looking for some crazy but relatively inexpensive-to-do pc modding tutorials. things like playing xbox games on pc or putting a mini lcd monitor in the drive bay or whatever. whatever you guys can think of. thanks.
you maybe better served using forums or websites that are dedicated to such topics. i googled and here are some results:  further, i found this website very useful:  to include the links they provide. as for modding itself, if you really want to stand out, you must &quot;create&quot; rather than put together off-the-shelf parts. you'll get the idea once you delve into this. good luck -----willy
yes. i agree. i'll check those links. thank you very much!
