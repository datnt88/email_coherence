just purchased a lexar usb 2.0 256mb jumpdrive. anyone know of a password protection program (free would be ok also), that can be installed on the usb jumpdrive to proctect data? i want something that can be installed on the jumpdrive itself so there's no need to install a program on every computer the drive is used on, that would not be a practical option for me.
instead of trying to find a program to 'lock' the jumpdrive, how about just using a small program to encrypt the data? these programs, that i'm about to name, are all under 1mb (some are lots! under) and you can place it on the jumpdrive and use it on whatever computer you need the data decrypted on. all these programs, and their descriptions, i was able to find on nonags . you can also go to the authors web location for more info and the programs themselves. nonags is a very useful site to discover free, or shareware, software that will not nag you to &quot;pay up&quot; check out  ------------------------------ truecrypt 2.1 for /win2k/xp (533 kb) homepage:  author: truecrypt description: truecrypt is a free open-source on-the-fly encryption software for windows xp/2000/2003. it can encrypt partitions/devices or create virtual encrypted disks within files. the only free open-source on-the-fly encryption software that fully supports windows xp. the only free open-source otfe software for windows xp that provides plausible deniability. encryption algorithms: aes (256-bit key), blowfish (448-bit key), cast, idea, triple des. ------------------------- advanced file security 2.3b for win9x/nt4/me/win2k/xp (280 kb) homepage:  author: eric prsel description: free file-encryption tool! simple, fast and safe! you can encrypt with this program every file type, content independent! it is very easy to use, so everyone can handle it immediately. due to the des encryption algorithm the files are extremely safe! you have also the possibility to encrypt folders (optionally with subfolders)! and the best...it is totally free (also no ads) and only 280kb small! ---------------------- ice encrypt v1.3a for win9x/nt4/me/win2k/xp (200 kb) homepage:  author: ice graphics description: ice encrypt is a simple files/folder encrypting program. ice encrypt uses for encryption algorithm of the new generation - icesafe. this is symmetric algorithm of encryption outperform all known symmetric block algorithms (des, aes, blowfish, gost, ...): 1. the size of a key for encryption / decryption always is about 1 million bits 2. the size of the block is a true variable. it can has any length like: 64 bit, 72 bit, 80 bit, ..., 128 bit, 1024 bit, 2097152 bit, ... up to 17179869184 bits. 3. theoretically is impossible to create faster block algorithm. 4. brute force attack against icesafe is not effective. it's difficult to crack key with size 1 million bits. 5. easy to implement in hardware. 6. it is possible to make very fast parallel encryption / decryption. 7. is easy to use icesafe for making hash or crc. 8. icesafe is a very simple and clear algorithm. ------------------------ axcrypt 1.4 for win9x/nt4/me/win2k/xp (230 kb) homepage:  author: axon data description: axcrypt is a file encryption program for windows 95/98/me/nt/2k/xp using the aes algorithm with 128-bit keys. it combines strong symmetric encryption with compression (if needed) and double-click editing/viewing. encrypted files have a '.axx' extension added to their names, and are shown with a new icon. to encrypt a file, right-click it in windows explorer and select 'axcrypt | encrypt'. to edit or view an encrypted file - just double-click it. to decrypt, right-click and select 'axcrypt | decrypt' instead. no configuration is necessary. run the installer, and axcrypt is ready to use. english, german, french, spanish, italian or swedish will be used for messages and dialogues depending on the language of the system. documentation (this document) and installation scripts are in english. unique features the following are features that really set it apart from all other file encryption tools, commercial as well as free: - double-click to edit/view with any application, with automatic re-encryption when done. - extensive command-line interface for scripting and programming. - 6 languages in one executable distribution. - absolutely no user configuration necessary or possible before use. - free and open source under gnu gpl. ------------------------- ddcrypt 2.0 for win9x/nt4/me/win2k (402 kb) homepage:  author: miguel garrido description: ddcrypt is a small, fast encryption program that integrates with the shell to let you encrypt files or folders, it also lets you create self-decrypting files! version 2.0 adds lots of features available in the readme at:
thanks chuckt.
you had a good chance to get a lexar &quot;secure&quot; drive which does what you want. possible? to return flashdrive and swap it for another lexar secure drive. otherwise, check with shareware filebase websites that have various pgms. available for this or that:   or any other websites good luck -----willy
circuit city has the jumpdrive 256mb sport by lexar on sale for $39 after rebate. it's small and i can use it as a keychain.
walt, i already have a 128mb secure jumpdrive from lexar. i like it very much in transfering files to systems where a cd would have to be burned, etc. and the keydrive is just *darn* handy. -----willy
willy, does the &quot;security&quot; feature come installed on the lexar secure model? i don't remember seeing on lexar's website a downloadable security application. i'm wondering if you need to reformat a secure drive, won't that wipe out the security feature and you have no way to download it to put it back?
