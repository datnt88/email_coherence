suddenly, network magic and pure sites are unavailable. what has happened?
i am having the same problem.... what's going on. does not speak highly for their network management
network magic was purchased by cisco a couple of months ago. most, if not all, of their servers are offline. if you are using version 4 you can continue using it on your home network. do not install version 5 as it died with the sale.
so.......... what's the plan? what is the future?
