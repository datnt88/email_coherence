hi, its me again, will i be able to keep my programs and such intack when i transfer my harddrive and stuff over to the new motherboard? or will i have to reinstall all of my programs again? im just tryin to decide if i should backup my data for my programs before i take my pc in to the computer place. i have windows xp.
reside on the hd, not the motherboard. but back up anyway. xp can be picky when changing too much hardware. and the motherboard carrys a lot of weight. take it to the computer place?
ok, thank you very much
ideally ur programs shud work with the new motherboard with xp detecting all the new hardware that is identified. though it wud be nice if u had a fresh installation for ur new motherboard from scratch. but if u cannot afford that u shud be able to wrk ur old xp installation with the new motherboard. but there is no harm in backing up ur data.
in same scenario but want old programs and games transfered to new hdd's with a clean install of xp pro? i am changing most things in my comp but want the games and patches that i took hours to download to work... hopefully from the neww 2 x wd caviar 80gb sata drives i got with k8v se deluxe asus mobo and amd 64 3000 cpu thanx bj
