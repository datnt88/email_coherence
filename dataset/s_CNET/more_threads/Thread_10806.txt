14147	2	138061	1552101	1551957	r9c	11/21/05 6:06 pm	1.13259636e12	yes	yea thanks for the info btw they suggestead 2.0 is the right firmware for it but it dosent really works well so if i were to used firmware 2.2 it dosent do any harm to the router wont it ?
14147	3	138061	1552119	1552101	r. proffitt	11/21/05 6:19 pm	1.13259714e12	yup, i've tried other versions. just make sure...	that its for that model. in closing, i've taken that your machine is free of spyware (try ewido from download.com) and you ran winsockxpfix (google.com) to set things straight. bob
14147	4	138061	1552597	1552119	r9c	11/22/05 1:09 am	1.13262174e12	yes	yea i updated the router firmware 2.0 but stills it works only for a moment then the problem presists again, any help suggestead ?

14147	6	138061	1554130	1552772	r9c	11/22/05 4:22 pm	1.13267652e12	both ?	do i have to installed both of it ? i tried ewido still the problem exits

14147	8	138061	1555669	1554916	r. proffitt	11/23/05 5:19 am	1.13272314e12	many would say yes.	if you run xp, the usual test, removal and fix tools i use are ewido then winsockxpfix. since spyware includes software that will send your banking information home to the rat that wrote it, why would you not remove any and all spyware? it's much like keeping that anthrax sample in you fridge. bob
14147	9	138061	1555776	1555669	r9c	11/23/05 6:15 am	1.1327265e12	right	yea i am aware of the damaged the spyware can cause and i have removed infact all of the spyware now using the software you recomended.and still it keep disconnecting from the router and have to restart it again in order to connect again. the thing now is i am not sure whether 100% of spyware is being cleaned and removed but when i try to scan it over no threat are beign found atm so could the problem lies with my router and i hope not so because its only 7 months old and have no money to buy a new one many thanks in advanced.

(i rarely give up.) bob
14147	11	138061	1555795	1551895	r. proffitt	11/23/05 6:27 am	1.13272722e12	recap. new firmware helped (?) and ...	next we get to change the rf channel. since other devices can interfere with your setup, i suggest you change the rf channel. try 1, then 5 or 6 then 11. if you have some neighbors with wifi then your signals may be getting some interference. be sure to try it without wep but turn on mac filtering for security until it gets stable. remember that low signals will disconnect. be sure that we are not &quot;expecting too much&quot; with a too far away connection. bob
14147	12	138061	1555805	1555795	r9c	11/23/05 6:33 am	1.13272758e12	i see	okay i will give it a try but i dunt think the problem is with the signal cause i sit around 4 meters awayed from the router and only a 1 meter wide wall seperated me and the router.and i will try the settings and get back to you as soon as possible and you know it can be real tricky sometimes it keep connecting fine around for 4hours + then suddenly it disconnected and hard to connect again : )
14147	13	138061	1555843	1555805	r. proffitt	11/23/05 6:47 am	1.13272842e12	that's a great clue!	the time span may be a clue that the router/wifi/wap is overheating. do what i do and make sure the router equipment is not under a book or such. for mine i stood my di524 on it's end to give it the best chance to run cooler. bob
14147	14	138061	1557246	1555843	r9c	11/23/05 4:20 pm	1.1327628e12	think so	i placed my router under the floor which is covered by carpet but now i made myself a 3 cm high stand for the router to stand on it because the router sometimes is very hot after few hours of using. will see wat changes it can do and get back here.
14147	15	138061	1559517	1557246	r9c	11/24/05 9:50 pm	1.132869e12	the real cause of it	now i think the real problem behind it. yesterday i managed to connected to the router for 8hrs+ without a single disconnection but today after logging in for 4hrs it start to disconnected again and i went into the room where the router were placed and it was quite warm because my friend forgotten to on the air condition.so i guess when the router got overheat it will make wireless connection harder so any idea to tips or even a special cooler like those one used to cool the laptop with a kind of special cooler fan ?
