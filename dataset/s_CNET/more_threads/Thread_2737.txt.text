i can't open 'my computer' or 'control panel'. programs open ok. error message states that there is a problem with windows explorer. updated virus def & scanned with norton antivirus and nothing found. anyone have any ideas what i could do to fix this problem. thanks for your help.
tell what  notes. bob
i did the scan and it showed &quot;safe, nasty unknown&quot; under the 'kind' category. the other categories did not reveal any information. the computer is not opening anything except internet. the error message states 'internet explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close'.
post your hjt log and tell if firefox works. what does dell tell you to do here? bob
what is hjt log and what is firefox? i haven't contacted dell about this. warranty expired.
you can find out what each is with ease. type firefox then hijackthis into  i don't hand out the answers, just teaching fishing... bob
