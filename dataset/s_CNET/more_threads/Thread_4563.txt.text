i am having a problem with this burner. i'm using dvdfab 6 to burn movies, the drive reads the movie just fine but when it gets to the stage of burning the temp file the drive won't recognize the blank media. it's a dual layer and i've tried ridata and maxell discs but still no recognition. can anyone shed some light on this. i'm using amd athlon 3000, 2.1 ghz, windows xp.
you tried other new drives?
i think it's the dvdfab6 problem. go download imgburn here on cnet and give it a try.
i see there are discussions about this if i use google.  notes an easy thing to try and a fine example of how folk want easy friendly answers. bob
it's not the dvdfab software. i have a laptop with an external drive that does just great with dvdfab. there's some other reason the nec drive isn't reading the discs. i went to the nec website to check for compatibility and they gave two other brands, fuji and phillips. i guess i'll try those and if they don't work either i'll need more feedback on this issue.
it a one way of trouble shooting the problem. if you don't think it's the software then it must be the hardware (and burner are not that expensive). good luck.
