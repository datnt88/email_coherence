how can i connect my wd hard disc to access this over my home wifi network. the wifi is airport extreme
i'm left to guess you are asking folk to duplicate the apple support on this. bob
it's not completely clear to me what you mean. assuming you have a bare hard drive not installed in anything, you can buy an enclosure for it for about $20 and connect to your computer via a usb cable. but then i don't know why wifi would be a factor. if you're talking about connecting a pc to a network via wifi, you can buy a usb adapter that does that nicely for as little as $10. good luck.
the hard disc is connected via usb to airport extreme but can not see it on my pc. despite trying not successful so far.
when the disc is connected to laptop via usb cable then it is ok. but if possible i would like this disc to be available to my laptop using my home wifi
you mentioned airport extreme in conjunction with wifi, so it sounded like this was a wireless router. i don't know how you could expect to connect a hard drive to that - i don't believe that's possible. is this airport extreme some kind of server? please elaborate.
&quot; windows users, a simple-to-use airport disk utility provides a variety of setup options, including setting the disk to become available whenever you connect to the network.&quot;
