dell dimension 2400 2.6ghz 256mb ram 80gig internal hdd running windows xp h.e i was running low on internal hdd space so my friend let me use his maxtor 80gb external hdd to back up some of my files , then we could proceed to remaster my internal hdd. we were able to put some files on the maxtor one evening. the next morning i tried to continue backing up( on my own ) and i remember getting an i/o error. so i stopped what i was doing since this external hdd didnt belong to me nor am i smart enough to figure this stuff out on my own. i have read thru all the discussions and different problems with these hdds. my computer shows drive g as being available, but when i scroll over it it doesnt show how much space is is on this hdd. i try to open it and my computer freezes. after several minutes it may say drive is not formatted would u like to formatt. now my friend did say the drive must just have been deleted and to goahead and reformat. i dont want to do that unless i know for sure his info is really lost. i downloaded pc inspector file recovery. this program is showing my maxtor hdd as a physical drive but not a logical one. i guess what i need is just a starting point. im willing to do trial and error i just need a little guidance from anyone willing! please let me know if i left out any pertinent info
fat32 or ntfs?
i believe orginally files were fat. if the drive has been reformatted then it would have been formatted to ntfs.
