could someone please help me make up my mind. i am a tablet virgin looking to finally pop my cherry. i am looking to not spend alot of money and im not a techie. i will be using it for online classes ( research, test taking, blogging, reading) and my son will be using it to play games and watch movies at home and on trips. i know that with the nexus comes google play and other apps but it doesnt have hdmi port or sd card slot and less onboard storage (8gb vs 32gb). they have the same screen resolution but the asus is 10&quot; vs 7&quot; for the nexus. does the asus have an app that i can download a bunch of games for free or at least inexpensively as well as some shows and movies if i went with it instead of the nexus? i could really use some advice.
i found them to be subpar for such applications. bob
no, i have never even used a tablet.
tablets are not laptop replacements for creating app, docs, yet. you see folk are trying this by adding keyboards but many have run out and bought these without checking it all out ahead of time. a few are quite burned up about it. these things will get better but for now, test drive it before spending your money. bob
