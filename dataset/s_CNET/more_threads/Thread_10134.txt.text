hi...im new to raid arrays. i currently have a 1.5tb hdd. i recently purchase another 1.5tb drive and i'd like to setup an array using the two disks. foremost i want to implement a raid 1 to achieve mirroring for data security. however would also like to have the speed increase of stripping. im considering using a os based raid 10, partitioning 4x 750gb partitions. howver my mobo does support raid arrays...and i curious about the differences between os based and hardware based raid systems..thnx.
raid 1 is rather interesting in that over the years i found it to save a customer once. it seems a shame that they worked and paid so much for a once in a lifetime event. today they learned the lesson and just image the drive each week and sync files daily. bob
some on-board raid is pretty slow also. but nvidia's mediashield performs well and intel's matrixraid is even better. matrixraid will allow you to partition two drives into 4 partitions and mirror the first partition of both drives and stripe the second partition of both drives. a hardware based striped array set can typically only be moved to another pc with the same raid controller. but a windows' based stripe-set could be moved to another pc if you configure your drives as dynamic disks.
