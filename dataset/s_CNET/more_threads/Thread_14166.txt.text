hi~ first time posting here here's a problem i have. reinstalled xp and it doesn't detect the onboard (vga compatible) video. i know have 640x480 and color quality is 4bit. woohooo!! in device manager as &quot;other device&quot; with yellow question mark. it's a *legend computer* &gt; nothing on their website! winbond motherboard &gt; no luck here either. at this point i'd be happy with any driver that would work. m vga compatible driver. shouldn't be this hard to find?? anyone know of a driver that is most likely to work? a &quot;m vga compatible driver&quot;!! thanks g
there were several video drivers listed under &quot;winbond&quot;. you didn't give your model number or any other identifiers so hard to say if yours is there... also i did find downloads on the winbond site (once i switched it to english.) but it was not clear to me of these were what you were looking for... hope this helps -- good hunting.
sounds like you need the via hyperon 4n1 driver for the mother board then the video driver,
