which scanner is better from point of view quality and speed, hp or canon? why?
you didn't supply any specific models to compare so one could rig the comparison to go either way. also needed is the intended usage of the scanner. there's little reason for some 4800 dpi optical scan for pictures you view on your 100 dpi computer monitor. but you may want such high optical numbers if you are doing archival work. bob
check recent reviews of speeds in places like pcmagazine, but last i checked and saw in real life the epson scanners beat out most of the others in scanning speed, unless you went over $350 or so in price.
