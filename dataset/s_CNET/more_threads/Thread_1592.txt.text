i just got a new video card that needs at least 300w power supply. i'd like to replace the one i have which is only 250w. what should i get?
i use antec in my home-builts. affordable and reputable. for your use, something around 500 watts.
with 135 mm fan and pfc. i have had good success with it. volt/amps are very important and you want to look for 12v/34 amps. you need the amps/volts to run newer video cards these days. this is almost more important than wattage.
