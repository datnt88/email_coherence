i was watching the audigy 2 zs gamer sound card but i was wondering if it doesnt make problems with the integrated sound that it has right now. it is an hp m7170n or do i have to just disable that one in my bios and install the sound card and let it recognize it?
get the platinum from compusa after rebastes for only $99. roger
you can just install the soundcard without disabling the onboard, when you install the drivers from creative it will set the audigy as the primary audio device, and windows will handle disabling the onboard sound as for what damasta is talking about, the zs gamer is nothing different from the 2 zs, except it includes a lot of free games, the platinum is no different from the 2 zs, except it includes the front panel i/o and a remote...along with a slightly different software suite
