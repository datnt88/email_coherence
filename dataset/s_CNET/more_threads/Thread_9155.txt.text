i was able to obtain some free office equipment that consisted of a netgear wireless bridge and an axis communications print server. is it possible to create a wireless print server on my home network through a wireless-g linksys router without having to go out and buy a wireless print server? i can configure the bridge and printer server seperately via direct connection to the router, but could not get anything to print when i hooked up the printer server to the bridge through a crossover cable. any ideas? thanks!
2. setup can be an itch. i'm going to decline commenting too much here except many won't read the manuals or have the time to learn about ip addressing, accounts, etc. bob
please spare me the sarcasm. if you don't have anything constructive to post, please don't say anything. i'm just a networking noob looking for quick help, that's all. thanks.
