im considering buying this pc with a athlon 64 3800+. just wondering if anyone had experience with this particular model. i couldn't find any reviews or info on this model so if u guys knew anything it would be greatly appreciated.
i looked and looked and looked but i didn't see any either. but you have an athlon 64 3800+ so it will be wicked fast. if you game, get a decent video card as well.
i have the intel version. suggest you get the top-of-the line 4000+. as for the gfx card, just get the x300se and upgrade yourself. it comes with 400watt psu, so get a 6600gt. not sure if the psu can be upgraded though. its cheaper if you build yourself. but if you too lazy or no idea, go to monarch, or cyberpower and customize it with retail parts instead of oem. just my two cents.
since you didn't list the price for this pc, i'm guessing that you could build one for the same money or less. now keep in mind that hp will not give you the xp cd only a recovery partion on the hard drive. they use a non standard mb so you will not be able to upgrade that. i think of hp as a low cost alternitive to dell. john
