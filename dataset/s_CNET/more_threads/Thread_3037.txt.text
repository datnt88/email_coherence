on the hardware side you need: 1) a network card or adapter in each computer 2) a length of cat5 cable long enough to connect the two cards on the sofware side: 1) internet connection sharing read all about it here&gt;&gt;&gt;
thank you for your reply. i guess i am under impression that some computers come with a network card?????? if so how do i tell if mine hase one. thanks again
two places to look: 1) device manager under network adapters 2) the back of your computer for a connector slightly bigger then a telephone jack.
