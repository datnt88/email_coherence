i'm upgrading my system to i5, but i'm stuck on what vga card to get. i'm on a budget, 130 dollars au is the limit. thinking ati 5750. link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp?product_id=73091
and it is sorted by bucks! -&gt;  &quot;radeon hd 5750 (check prices) great 1920x1200 performance in most games radeon hd 5770 codename: rv840 &quot;juniper&quot; process: 40nm universal shaders: 720 texture units: 36 rops: 16 memory bus: 128-bit core speed mhz: 700 memory speed mhz: 1,150 (4,600 effective) directx/shader model: dx 11/sm 5.0 while the radeon hd 5750 offers similar gaming performance to it's less-expensive competition (the radeon hd 4850 and geforce gts 250), it has better longevity appeal with directx 11 support. sporting dolby truehd/dts-hd master audio and three monitor outputs, the 5750 might appeal to those who want a low-power gaming card appropriate for an htpc.&quot;
the 5750 is pretty weak - directx 11 sounds good and all, but i'm doubtful of that card's abilities to properly run any directx 11 games on the market. i can shave a few dollars off the price and at least put you into hd5770 territory.
i agree with you.
it's worth thinking about what resolution your monitor is (and therefore the resolution you will be aiming to run games at) as well as what games you are likely to play. take a look at some benchmarks at places like tomshardware to help you choose the right graphics card for your budget and needs.  has some brief advice about choosing a graphics card and how to install a graphics card if you fancy taking a look. generally speaking i think the ati radeon 5 series have been well received, however the 5750 is somewhat underpowered for many games and higher resolutions. hope that is some help!
5770 is ok. but i actually have 1 for evga 9800gt, works perfectly! link:
