all of a sudden, my usb drives are running super slow. i made no changes or additions to what is plugged in the drives. whenever i plug in the drive i get &quot;this drive could perform faster&quot; (which never happened before) when i go to load a new large file onto my usb drive/portable hd, ect. i get 1 mb/sec (at most). any port i try it in, i get the same speed. any ideas? solutions?
the owner had updated drivers with windows update or that driver update button. as there is no make or model we can't discuss ideas on where the right drivers might be. this leaves the advice to use system restore to the time before &quot;sudden.&quot; bob
hp m9350fsuch as this:  however i do have win7 ultimate on it (but the drives were fine after i installed 7 about a year ago)
my advice is to use system restore to when it worked. as to the cause, the cause continues to be that windows update and accepting drivers most of the time. if that's some hp, check hp for motherboard drivers to install and hope. bob
scan your system for worm that may have caused degradation in the performance of the usb drive..
