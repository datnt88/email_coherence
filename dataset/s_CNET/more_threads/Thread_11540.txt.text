if theres anyone there using dell xps gen3. i have a problem in accessing the cdrom drive. the problem is it can read dvd disc but it cannot read or write cd disc. i might say i'm out of option. i have already uninstall and re-install the drivers still it doesn't work. i hope somebody outthere can help me on this and it will be highly appreciated. thanks.
is it under warranty?
if you have a dell, try delltalk . this link is to their xps forum, which has a cd/dvd forum (listed to the right under xps desktop)that should help. you will have to register, but that's no problem. people there are quite helpful.
replying to 3 month old posts is interesting. hopefully they found an answer within a few weeks. cheers, bob
