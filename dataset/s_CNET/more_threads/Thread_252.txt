5692	0	62338	738942	nr	kelnetbc	2/3/05 10:53 pm	1.10747118e12	video upgrade - what do i get?	i have a compaq pc, 733 mhz, p3, 128mb ram, currently running an nvidia tnt2 graphics card. i'd like to upgrade the graphics, now that there are plenty of used g-force cards on the market. i play a lot of older games (unreal tournament, riven, madden 2002, ghost recon), but there are some newer games that i'd like to get which require a better graphics card. is there a noticeable difference between a g-force 2 and g-force 4 card? any other suggestions?

5692	2	62338	739040	738942	john robie	2/4/05 1:56 am	1.10748216e12	video upgrade	do as matt-page suggest, add at least another 128mb of ram before you do anything. it is not hard to do. check  for what type you will need for your particular pc. here are some old test of video cards that show performance rating under different games. april 2002  december 2002  i would suggest the geforce 3 ti-500, or the geforce 4 ti-4200.
