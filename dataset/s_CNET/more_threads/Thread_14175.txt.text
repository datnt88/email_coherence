i have a special electronic product shops. also cater to trade business.currently, tablet pc market is the ipad?s world. however, other companies also launched their new products. i got a new product, want to know whether it can get most people to like it.this may reduce the risk of sales. hope to get everybody's feedback. thank you. screen:10?1024*600 capacitive multi-touch lcd screen processor:nvidia tegra 2 t20 dual arm cortex-a9(1ghz)
very nice.
viewsonic's product has not yet selling on other country now, only u.s.a. i have started selling this product zpad. hope it has a good harvest, will not let me down. viewsonic products also looks good.viewpad 10&viewpad 7.viewpad 10 using the win7 and android1.6.win7 is a good choice but android1.6 was some lag. nvidia tegra 2 may be popular next year, on the pad.hope that..
and the market app. so it's all current stuff. you can find the older 1.6 model in the bargain bins. bob
