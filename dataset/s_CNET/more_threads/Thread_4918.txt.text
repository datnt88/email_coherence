everytime i try to open a file on my hp tablet i get a message that says ''cannot open mime type&quot; hp says they have no fix for this problem does anyone have suggestions?
all files? or only one? if only one, what kind of file is it? for example, to open a quicktime movie, you need apples quicktime. to open a microsoft project file, you need microsoft project. so it can very well be that you don't have the right program installed on your tablet to open this type of files. but you didn't provide the details. kees
most times it pdf file. i went to adobe cannot find any downloads. its when i try to open attachments.
says it has a free one that works on webos. i can't confirm that because i don't have a webos machine. kees
