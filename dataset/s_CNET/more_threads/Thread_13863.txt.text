my cousin sent me this computer he was building to me so i can try to fix it. i redid all the partition on the hard drive and was able to install windows xp. however, when its about to load, the screen goes blank recieving no signal or it glitches. the monitor is hooked up to an ati radeon car. im thinking its drivers issue but how am i suppose to install the drivers? i am able to go into safe mode. any ideas on what to do?
you might try reformatting again, however it sounds like its more likely a hardware problem, power supply info? system specs? etc
asus case antec 500 watts power supply asus a8v deluxe motherboard 1 gig crucial ram amd anthlon 64 3500 now i get picture and it looks great except it freezes in 5 minutes.
&quot;isn't that optional?&quot;
when i tried my nvidia 7900 on a 250 watt psu the same thing happened, i new it wouldnt work but i had to see if the video card was a working one somehow so i got a 600 watt psu and that was a piece of crap and it fried my cpu somehow =o ultra is not a very good brand. so i got a new mobo cpu and case and ram and the same video card works fine no problems even ocing it quite a bit so im confident it might be ur gpu =d i hope i help
