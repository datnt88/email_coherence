i'm buying a new rig soon.considering an amd phenom ii 1090 t with a gigabyte ga-790 xta-ud4 board,and 8 gigs or ddr3 dual channel memory.though i'm not a &quot;gamer&quot; i do however edit and compile a lot of dvd's in keeping up with my grand kids.i already have 2 evga geforce 9500 gt video cards and just can't find a link to see if they are compatible with this rig.really like to find out before i buy it.anybody know where i can get that info?
the motherboard has 2 pcie-x16 slots, although one works at x8 (works slower).
however, will they boost performance over a single gpu ... i don't think so. the mb supports crossfire (dual ati/amd gpus) but makes no mention of sli. let us know what you find. vapcmd
looks like i'm better off just eating the cost of those cards and go with something more compatible.i'm even going to reconsider the whole amd thing,too.i've never used intel so i'm not sure if it's rated better or worse but i was looking at a barebones builder and came up with this  it's definitely a little more than i was wanting to spend,but doing it right the first time pays off
