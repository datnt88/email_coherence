i am about to upgrade everything in my pc so i need this question answered. what is the difference between intel's 865pe chipset and the 85p chipset? which is the newer or more advanced one. please reply.
why intel? why not go for an athlon 64 instead? imo it doesn't make sense to buy a 32 bit processor now, unless it is very low priced.
865 and 875 intel series? i recall something about the 875 including what is called pat technology which is supposed to provide a small performance gain. some mb manufacturers such as asus, are said to have unlocked it in some of their 865s. i believe intel calls the 875 their &quot;canterwood&quot; and the 865 the &quot;springdale&quot;. i've read there is little performance difference, however. some say the 865s are a better value. most will now support the intel prescott cpus.
