i bought one external hard drive, it actually explained that it has fat32, not the nfts. which i did't kow about it until i read the document. and i bought another one external hard drive, it is also fat32, but it didn't even bother to put it on the brochure to explain it. so i am just wondering if i should reformat to nfts ? or just leave it ? most computers are using win xp now these days. so...
ntfs is damage resistant and fat32 is not. your choice. bob
i just read an article online. it is definitly better. but i am just surprised that new external hard drive that i bought did not even mention to convert it.
