for my graduation project as a senior next year for high school, i decided to build a computer. normally i would wait until the end of august to construct it (price drops) but i want to build it sometime in july (that way i have time to make sure nothing goes wrong and i can enjoy it during the summer). the one thing i'm having difficulty deciding on is picking the cpu. because this system is more on the budget side, i'll be using cheaper processors. i narrowed it down to the pentium 4 524 (3.06ghz 1mb l2 cache w/ ht), pentium d 805 (2.66ghz 2x!mb l2), or athlon 64 3500+ (2.2ghx 512kb l2). i play games, but not at high resolutions and this is my first build so i'm not sure if i should handle an lga775 cpu. any suggesstions?
sry i should have put this in but i'm thinking athlon 64 due to heat from prescott and smithfield, but i'll galdly listen to any other opinions.
cpus will likely be a bit cheaper when conroe is out which is supposed to be next month ya know. even if you go with something older it may well be much cheaper after the new stuff comes out. regards, jb
i have a 3700+ and the 3.0ghz ht the kid has is just a tad faster. bob
all the p4's that you're talking about have the 533mhz bus. if anything, wait until after conroe is released; amd will cut the prices of their dual-core cpus in half.
