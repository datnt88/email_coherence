(the p led slots on my mobo are already filled) i've tried google but nothing is really pinpointing what i need to know. i would love to find a site that explains the current from the psu a bit. at the moment i really have no clue what the red/black/and yellow wires of my 3-pins mean specifically but i would love to (i am just now starting to mess with wiring. i normally just strayed from that). thanks in advance all!
