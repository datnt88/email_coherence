9983	3	124714	1413001	1412468	smokieuk	9/10/05 11:13 am	1.12635078e12	re:	thanks for both replies. trying a different brand isn't a solution i'm afraid. my router uses proprietary methods to delivery 108mbps. else i'll have 108mbps cards running at 54mbps. cookies are not stored, cache is emptied when firefox is closed, history isn't even stored (0 days setting). not that i don't appreciate your reply but that's too obvious a solution and of course i've already tried it. besides, the problem doesn't happen on wired, even with a full cache. i keep the firmware up-to-date. in fact, at one point it seemed to improve on a few updates. the firmware with the v3 model is up-to-date. it's only just hit the stores. as a gesture netgear have replaced my v2 with a v3. i've still got to work out this problem though. thanks again.

9983	6	124714	1448689	1448664	linkit	9/29/05 11:31 pm	1.12803666e12	firmware again	even though the wgt624 v3 model just hit the stores, it may have been boxed months ago. take a look at the firmware on netgear.com. it looks like there is a &quot;version 1.0.128_1.0.1&quot;. it was published on 15-sep-2005 and includes 12 bug fixes. on the other end, download the latest driver for the wireless network adapter. hope this helps!

(dumb question? lol) this is why i posted my problem here, hoping someone had the same issue and a fix for it. it's quite a unique case, otherwise it would be known by netgear. there were a few previous versions of firmware that seemed to perform better -- but the problem was still there. that suggests a flaw in the firmware, but there's thousands of people who use netgear routers on the same isp as me. it would be known straight away if there was such a problem. when i test it at my friend's house on his connection, if the result is fine, i'll ask for a new cable modem from my isp. my current one is around 5 years old and the modems they ship now are completely different.
