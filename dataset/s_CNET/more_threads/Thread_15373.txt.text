hello, i can't watch a single youtube video without experiencing a freeze. here is what happens during 6 minute video clip:  as you see it's almost impossible to watch... this happens occasionally in other sites too. i remember once or twice even speedtest.net froze during the test. same with bigger downloads from sites - i have to pause then resume to finish downloading but file gets damaged from it. sometimes it downloads smoothly though ;l torrents download with no problems. also, sexy videos never freeze so what's wrong with my internet? changing browsers or anti virus didn't make any difference ;l maybe i should configure router in some specific way? specs: win7 64bit newest updates gygabite p61-usb3-b3 intel i3-2120 hd5670 no parts were oc'ed please help!
did you try the usual? google this phrase. -&gt; disable flash hardware acceleration. this only affects some machines but when you write youtube, i do that first. bob
i remember trying this out ages ago but it was not related to the issue!
given the sparse clues i'll wait for more.
