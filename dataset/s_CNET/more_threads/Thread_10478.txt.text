hello, i'm not sure if anyone has ever heard of this problem, but i'll still give it a shot. i will try to explain it as much as i can. say i connected to my network, but then, if i turn off the router without turning off the wireless on my laptop, and then i turn the router back on again, my laptop wont connect to the network again -- it can't even find any access points! (i got two access points in my house) -- (i have to restart my laptop to fix it) but, i wont have any issues if i turn off the wireless on my laptop before turning off the router. it would connect again with no problem. does anyone think it could be a service that i disabled or put on manual? any help greatly appreciated. thank you!
we have a note on what to change in our forum sticky.
i'm sorry, but i can't seem to find anything in the sticky that may solve my issue. care to tell me which post is it? thanks. meanwhile, i'll keep searching for it!
but your post's details are so slim that i'm guessing it may or may not help.
