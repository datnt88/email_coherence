alright so i just bought a new linksys wireless router, model no. wrtg54g2. i got it all setup and such and got it working with my itouch. but for some reason it won't work with my laptop. when i go to the view available wireless networks, it doesnt show up. i have a feeling the problem is with my laptop not seeing the router since the itouch and the router work fine. anybody wanna help?
please share if not.
yes i did.
your post was light so all i can write is the above. try making a complete post.
i'm not sure what other info i can give you. the power, connection, and wirless lights are all on the router. it works fine for connecting and getting on the internet with my ipod touch so i know the router is working and sending out a signal. but for some reason when i go to view the wireless network connections on my laptop the router does not show up. is their anyway to turn on the wireless on my laptop
a little button to turn the wireless on and off. dell sometimes uses fn & f2 at the same time. click on start, connect to, view wireless networks. what do you get? rick
we have a forum note asking for such so you don't forget. also you could tell if it works at free wifi spots and more.
