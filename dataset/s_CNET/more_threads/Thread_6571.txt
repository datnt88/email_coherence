(windows xp home-sp2) i bought it because the drive attached to my computer could no longer be depended upon to burn cds. (my computer is 5 years old!) this new drive is great, and now i can burn dvds, which my old drive could not do. it also burns cds from downloaded digital music brilliantly. the only problem is, when i open itunes to play a cd, this drive will not play cds in itunes! it will play music cds in windows media player though. (but my entire music library is in itunes! so i burn all of my music cds using itunes.) so, i called the manufacturer, and sure enough, he said this drive is incompatible with itunes. my question to you guys is, is there any way around this fact? (is he just telling me this because of some loyalty &quot;deal&quot; they have with win media?) because i can not figure out a way to get music from cds uploaded into itunes. when i try, the song, and all of it's info, appears in itunes and on my ipod, but the music simply does not play even after i've converted the song to a format itunes plays! (by the way, i use these cds for my job as an exercise instructor. so i depend on my equipment to enable my work!) had i not already gotten rid of the box and receipt, i would've returned this drive. (nothing on the box or in the instructions says the drive is incompatible with itunes. i think that's a bit shady.) am i doomed to be unable to upload music cds? do these external drives ever say they are compatible/incompatible with itunes? i'd appreciate any info you-all have on this topic.

11916	2	256543	2541229	2541003	kenmoo	7/16/07 9:16 am	1.18457736e12	thanks bob	bob, thanks for the quick response! now, my only reason for keeping this drive has to do with an abject fear of buying yet another drive that will not work with itunes! (remember, there was no indication that this new drive would not work with itunes till i called the manufacturer and asked! so how is one to know??? $70.00 down the tubes because i immediately disposed of the box and receipt. yup, stupid.) now that i've learned that lesson, i invision myself buying and returning drives until i hit one that's compatible! that's my only concern. so i am definitely going to newegg.com or geeks.com, if i can be sure the drives work with itunes! (also, i'm hoping i can find an external drive so i won't have to open my computer for installation.) thanks again man.

(i did check out newegg.com and found an external drive by lg that is in my price range. i'm going to email them and ask if it will work with itunes.)

11916	6	256543	2541744	2541653	kenmoo	7/16/07 9:25 pm	1.1846211e12	okay	bob, this idea of firmware is real new to me. and i notice on the page the link brought me to, there are many different versions of this firmware. which version would i chose? the latest, no? and is installation simple? this is my last ditch effort, so i think i will try it. and if it doesn't work, i got my new choice on newegg.com to start fresh with. (anyway, i am grateful i'm not losing 100s and 100s of dollars because of not keeping the box and receipt!!!) thanks for your patience with me.
