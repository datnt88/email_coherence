quick question: i have a printer with a usb connection currently connected to my win xp desktop. i don't really care for the windows print feature on xp, seems to be hit or miss with my other pcs on the network at times. i would like to know if i can connect the printer directly to the network router port. i understand there are usb to ethernet adapters, will this assign an ip from the router that other pc's can use as a network printer, or do i need to get a mini print server? also, the printer port is the type b square usb connection, while most convertors have a type a to lan. do they sell a type b unit?
each device connected to a router must have a nic. does your printer have a nic?
either the printer manufacturer offers an internal print server that you can install in the printer, or you get to purchase a usb print server. usb-a or -b doesn't matter because you can purchase whatever cable you need. there are wired and wireless print server models. it's best to purchase a print server that is known to work with your printer model.
