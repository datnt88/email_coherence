(give this name admin rights) this user must have a password, but for wake onlan etc i have another username with no password be the default startup user, with no sign-in window. all that matters is those common names and passwords just exist on all computers, they don;t have to be logged on apparently. 2) in win2k, use the network wizard (sytem/ network id) to create a workgroup name. have each computer join this network (same name). 3 in windows explorer, under properties allow sharing. use the window to turn the disk names to plain, not with $ sign as that makes it invisible. 4 allow access to ip addresses in all firewalls on all computers. may not be totally correct but that's what worked i think. never saw this simple list anywhere. --fj
