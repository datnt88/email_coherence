i've noticed that some external hard drives have a port to connect ac power and then a seperate port for the usb. does anyone know what the power slot is for? i know that it's meant for an adaptor to be pluged into, but i though usb ports can provide power as well as transfer data. just curious. i've had a drive for some time that has both and i've always just pluged the usb cable into the laptop. thanks for any information you guys can give.
all of the 3.5&quot; hard drives in external enclosures i've seen require more power than the usb ports can provide. some 2.5&quot; laptop drives in external enclosures can run off the power from one usb channel but for larger drives...probably 80gbs or 100gbs and above require power from 2 usb ports ...they have a &quot;y&quot; cable and can also run off ac adapters too. hope this helps.
most usb devices take a few watts, maybe 4-5 max. but hard drives can take as much as 25 watts. ~ibrahim~
thanks for that information. i have worked for weeks to try to solve that problem. i have searched all over the web and downloaded this and that but nothing seem to help. i even done a full system recovery but that didn;\,t didn,t help either. i,ll try this and see if it works.
i have an i/o magic dvd+rw+r external usb 2.0 duel format 8x dvd rewritable drive with instantcd/dvd and pinnacle studio 8 it use to work just fine till i put it up for awhile to get through the holidays now when i plug it up it will stay on for just a few minutes then go off and on. i see an icon in the taskbar that says found new hardware. i try to click on it but nothing happens finally it will show an icon to safely remove hardware what can i do to solve this problem
