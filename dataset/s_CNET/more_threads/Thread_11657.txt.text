first post in forums, cut a beginner some slack. friend's computer. emachines et1331g-07w nvidia geforce 6150se integrated windows 7 home premium 64bit amd athion ii x2 250u dual-core processor 640 gb hdd 4gb ddr2 memory its hooked up to dell monitor via vga. when computer turns on it doesn't show any of the boot up process, fans run, the keyboard and monitor lights flash green then the moniter goes yellow. if you press the moniter buttons it displays a message along the lines of 'moniter in power save mode, press any key or move the mouse etc.' but the mouse and keyboard are unresponsive, the mouse glows red but nothing happens. i haven't found an answer in my surfing.
gives you and introduction to troubleshooting dead pcs. there is no &quot;answer&quot; to be found according to some folk. i think some think they can fix this without swapping parts and for those folk, they get another pc or end up at a shop counter. bob
thanks, i'll have to ask him if he's okay with me pulling it open. quick clarification, when i turn the computer on, while the screen never does anything the power button light is lit, does that mean i can bypass the checking of the power supplys connection to the motherboard?
but asking to open the case means i would be returning this the next time i see them. i have repaired thousands of machines over the years (my background is more embedded computing than pcs) and repair involves a lot of knowledge but the pc is simpler. we don't fix a board today. we swap it out. bob
i had a similar scenario a couple of years ago (quite rare) it turned out to be the monitor, that would be the first thing, try another monitor
