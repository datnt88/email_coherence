(64 bit instead of 128 bit wep for one thing). he told me that the dell draft n wireless mini-card in my laptop may have compatiblility issues with a netgear router. (i had no problems at all until the comcast lines were cut by the direct tv installers)! at any rate, he made me cut back on the encryption level, and now i'm back on line.
