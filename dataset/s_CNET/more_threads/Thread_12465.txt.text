i just recently upgraded everything but my gpu which is the nvidia geforce gt 520. my screen now randomly flickers, and makes the sound as if a usb has been unplugged. i'm running windows 8, as i was on my last pc and it never did such thing. i tried the latest drivers for the card, and even some previous versions and nothing has fixed this. gaming seems to make it happen just a bit more frequently, and sometimes it minimizes the game and flashes non-stop, resulting in a reboot. other system components are i5 3570k 8gb ddr3 ram, 1tb hdd, any advice would be great because i'm at a loss. thanks.
and is this a fresh install of the os? and finally, why not give a short run down of the machine before and after? if you changed the motherboard the classic gaffe is to leave an extra mounting post where there should be none. bob
hey bob. i'm running a completely new system from the tower, to everything inside of it (except the gpu). completely fresh os install of win8. my old system was a core 2 duo e5300, 4gb of ram 250gb hdd, win8, and i forget the exact mobo but it was an lga775 with q35 chipset. i've also noticed that when the screen flashes and i have the display options in front of me, it goes from displaying &quot;syncmaster p2350(g)/p23500&quot; to &quot;generic non pnp monitor&quot; then flashes back and changes the name to my display device. it's weird. sorry if i left out any information, still kind of new to the forum scene. thanks.
and yes, everything including power supply.
sorry but i'm not seeing makers catch up with the changes. we do know there are issues. and just yesterday i read about a game that was glitching just like you described and no fix is out yet. be sure to chat with motherboard and video card makers if they have updates. but that won't help that game issue. bob
