hello all i have an amd chip system and need to connect a usb mouse to it. when booting up i do receive the screen which indicates a new usb device has been detected etc.. challenge is, i do not have software for its' installation. is it that i might need to go to the ibm web site and d/l the software to disk or even the usb site and then try to install the proper drivers? amd, 512k memory, 20g drive thanks...
amd chipsets are not supported well by microsoft oses. you should install the motherboard driver package and usb drivers if the maker offers them. this is a condensation of what you can read in depth at  bob
they installed the motherboard drivers and it worked. bob
