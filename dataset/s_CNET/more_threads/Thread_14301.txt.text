i recently purchased a new computer and very happy with it, with one small exception: it doesn't have hdmi output. would like to stream movies, tv shows and etc and display them on my hdtv. is there a relatively inexpensive way to get hdmi output on my pc? thanks in advance for the help. steve
if so you may find playing &quot;protected&quot; content quite the hoot. but the cheap way is a video card with a hdmi output. bob
any models of video cards you think i should consider? thanks!
i shop at newegg.com for such.
