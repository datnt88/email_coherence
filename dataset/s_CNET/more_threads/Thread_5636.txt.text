hi, i bought a sony dvd(burner) drive and i hook up to my workstation. some times my xp pro recognizing the drive and most of the times it is not recognzing. i can't see the drive in file explorer. when i go to the safe mode i was able to see. right now it is not working and i was frustrated why it is not recognizing. pls help me out with this. thanks
is it jumpered properly. when you saw it in safe mode was there also another entry??? if so remove all of the entries and then reboot and let the system find it again.
power and ribbon cables for likely damage and are securely plugged in
are you using clonecd or uninstalled it recently? i had this problem and it appeared to stem from that..
