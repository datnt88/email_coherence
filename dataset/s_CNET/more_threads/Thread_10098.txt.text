i would like to be able to make copies from my laptop, while using it in the dining room, by using the printer in my office. i know this can be done but have no idea how to do this or where to start. it is to complicated for a person with average computer knowledge? thanks, lorelee
see it at  but ignore system mechanic for the time being.
i can't believe i got this to work!! thanks so much for suggesting network magic. this was easier then i thought it would be and i did not know i can also network files. now i will see if it works when i get up in the morning!! thanks again. lorelee
you're welcome.
