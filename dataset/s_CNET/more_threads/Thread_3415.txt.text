i have a seagate external 160 gb hd that i was using successfully over the last 4 months and then all of a sudden now when i connected it via usb (same way i have been doing in the past) it is not recognizing the drive and asking me to re-format. called seagate and they said that reformatting is my only option. also checked out a couple data recovery softwares to see if i could get my data back...but wanted to see if there was anything i could do to get the drive working to how it used to. the drive shows up in my computer but i cannot access the files anymore....please help. i am running windows xp pro and also have a mac at home. i was using the hd straight out of the box (fat32 i believe)...just plug and play before...have all my data on it...please advise! thanks in advance!
i only know what you write in your post. in xp pro sp1 and sp2 the limit was raised to over 127gb (reference  ) install the sp1 at least to see if the drive comes back. also review  for solutions found there. -&gt; and try the back usb ports. bob
i am on sp1 and i used to be able to access this hd till a couple days ago...i'm going to review the posted solutions on the other forum and see it that works...thanks for your response. i did try the back usb ports
