greetings. for over a year, i have been using dual evga 9800gts's in sli mode. even tried 3 at one time, did not do much to improve anything. i just removed the 9800's and installed daul evga 250gt's with 1gig ram each. in boarderlands now running the 250's, i am seeing some latency that was not there with the 9800's! i was under the assumption that the 250's were a step up from the 9800's which only have 512m each. please advise. thanks.
it looks like a minimal upgrade. but the performance overall could be less as more quality in the rendering could eat up any gain in the gpus. in otherwords, 2 steps forward and 2 steps back. i'd expect a better looking display but no gains. bob
250gts is the same cpu as a 9800gtx. the extra ram is not enough to make a diff.
