hi everybody. i'm looking for really good desktop speakers for my computer. i definitely want a powerful sub, but i want a balance between rich bass and crisp trebles. there are so many speakers to chose from that it's mind-baffling. any suggestions of specific models or brands are extremely appreciated. i don't want to spend a butt-load of money, but i'm open to high-end models. thanks! nick
there are many more good brands, but i would look at logitech and creative speakers. they tend to be more affordable without sacrificing quality, and they win awards and good reviews. i personally game with a 3-year old set of logitech 5.1's that i bought for $35 and still love
hi, i like the klipsch pro media 2.1 speakers. great sound, built very well ( not cheap plastic) and fairly inexspensive.
