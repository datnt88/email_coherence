we have 3 computers networked via cable modem. two desktops, one laptop. the laptop has lost browser capability, and i'm not able to find what the problem is. i've run norton, adaware, no-adware, and done a system restore. nothing is working... does anyone have any idea's on what may have caused this and how to fix it? i'll appreciate your input. thanx
the ip configuration. command prompt, ipconfig /all. if the default gateway is not present or different than your other computers, try ipconfig /release followed by ipconfig /renew commands. if the computer will connect by ip addresses but not by names, it's a name resolution issue. try ipconfig /flushdns command.
for your input. i've been working over-time all week, but off this weekend and will do what you suggested. i'll let you know the results.....
