i have a pc, running xp, that has a dual head s-vga video card. it came with a cable which splits it to two vga outs. so i comfortably run two monitirs at a decent relolution. one goes to a projector, the other to my monitor. cool beans. now i have a need for an additional s-video out (carrying the same signal as the projector), which goes to a video switcher, and ultimately to a dvd recorder. what is the simplest way to accomplish this? i have an older all-in-wonder card that could be installed at no cost, but will xp allow that?
svga is not the same as s-video. are you looking for an adaptor that would convert svga to s-video?
so long as it has different interface (agp, pci, pci-express) than your primary video card and you have a slot for it. but you're trying to clone a high-res (s-vga) image onto low-res (s-video) signal. that's going to be a problem unless a) you're willing to drop the res of one of the s-vga outputs or b) you're prepared to manually switch your video playback between output devices (s-vga or s-video). ati's video driver can automatically send video to a preferred monitor, but i don't think it can send it to two seperate monitors of different resolutions.
the video cable needs to be connected directly to the tv for windows to configure and use it properly. get a switcher for the tv, not the dvd.
if i have a pci dual head svga, and one vga card (all-in-wonder), would they not process the signal separately?
