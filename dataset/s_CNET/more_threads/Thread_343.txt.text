i am using arctic cooling freezer 7 as my cpu fan and my cpu temperature is 40 c idle and 60 c fully loaded. i think it is pretty high and it may reduce my cpu life. should i get a better cpu heatsink? any suggestions? thanks! computer spec: 3.2ghz pentium 4 640
gotten an amd. they outperform and consume much less power.
i have a p4 630 and the temps are about 2-4 deg c higher than yours and i think they run that way.
btw, my temp was not that high. it was 36 idle and 47 loaded. after i replaced my powersupply (it was burnt), i think i touched the heatsink during the process and no matter how i mounted and tighten the heatsink, it is not as good as it was b4. im sure it has nothin to do with the psu because i replaced with the same one. i think it's just my heatsink clamps are not as tight as it was b4
