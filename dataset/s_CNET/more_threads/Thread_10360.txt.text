i am trying to connect my creative zen vision m to my laptop, but it is not working. i believe the problem may be with the usb ports, but i have tried everything i can think of to fix it. the only other option i have left is to buy a powered usb hub. does anyone have any ideas? i am using a dell inspiron 8600 and windows xp. the usb ports are 2.0.
come with any software or drivers?
yes. i installed everything that was on the cd. i have been thinking that the usb ports are underpowered, but i have changed some of their settings and still cannot get the device recognized.
i don't know if you are still having this problem, b/c your post is old, but i had the same problem with my creative zen micro. i don't think it is your usb ports - i had the problem on my dell and then on my toshieba tecra - where i plug in my device but the zen software does not see it - but napster sees it. with some (or perhaps all and i never noticed) usb drivers, you have to use the same port that you used when you installed the device. but i think your problem is just a creative problem. i don't have the problem with other mp3 players that i have (iriver) and i dont' have it with other usb devices i use on my laptop.
i have a creative zen v 1 gb that i just bought and connected it to the usb and a little window popped up saying that i need a high speed usb.i was wondering how i change my usb to a usb 2.0 [ i belive i have a usb 1.1 right now]. i have a aopen computer that i bought that has been completley remodified and has windows xp so im not too sure at what i need to buy to change my usb port into a high speed port or what i need to do.if anyone knos prices,where i can find this port that i need and can help me in any way with this please email me a xxocmcrdxx@yahoo.com i just got my mp3 for my birthday a month ago and i reallly wanna get it working.thankies. rachel
