hi all, i used to build pc's a while ago. things have changed a lot and i realize that i'm probably better off coming here with a couple of questions....for all you builder geeks wink here's what i want to accomplish: through ebay or other used vendors, i want to put together a system for some gaming (not the latest stuff) and intenet - kids pc. so in the fast paced world of pc parts, what would be my most cost effective and cheapest way to build one up from scratch? looking to spend very little -100$ or so all builds welcomed! here's some of what i've seen on ebay - my problem is knowing what all i'll need for a particular build say an amd 64 socket 754?? i don't know, you guys suggest - i'm listening thanks for your patience! pierce
a $100 isn't going to go far w/o some &quot;real bargains&quot; thrown at you. in other words, don't expect much even if you shop on ebay as s/h can be a killer. pick a cpu and mtrbd. combo deal to get things going and &quot;if&quot; you find a system then all the better. just, beware what's being offered in cpu, p4 or dual core, etc and the required mtrbd. plus the case. if you buy piece-meal then pricing will be more expensive unless a &quot;bare bones&quot; or used system(of some merit) is offered. heck, even a new basic system will do wonders if you shop or wait for it as $399 bargains can be had minus the monitor is all likelihood. trust no one, read the buyers reviews with some grain of salt. look at checking your local goodwill or sal. army outlets for some items plus yard sales. tada -----willy
hi, thanks! definitely looking for the good deals on ebay. i have some experience with it so i'm not new at it. i've seen deals like this: dfi lanparty nf590 sli socket am2 motherboard for 15$. cpu also like the one i mentioned for really cheap.
