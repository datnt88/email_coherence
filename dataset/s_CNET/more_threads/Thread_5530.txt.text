i have a four+ year old dell desktop with a geforce3 ti 200 graphics card. i want to upgrade to a card with more dedicated memory preparing for adding vista later. don't play graphics intensive games. could anyone please confirm my old card is in an agp slot? 2x/4x or 4x/8x??? any recommendations for models,brands or store would be appreciated. thanks.
all pc's with agp slots made after 2000 are 4x or 4x/8x, so any agp card will do. for vista, go with at least a radeon x series or geforce 6000 series or later card (avoid geforce 4/fx5000 and radeon 90000 series). earlier cards may lack driver support and aren't really saving you any significant money. you only need 128mb since you're not a gamer. here's a perfect $41 card for you and the absolute cheapest card you should consider:
many thanks ramarc! just the help i was looking for. appreciate it.
