i have a seagate 250gb hardrive and it has been working greatly untill a few days ago. whenever i connect it to my computer, it makes my computer really slow and i cant do anything untill i turn it off. i tried to run a disk check when it occasionally poped up on my computer, but it failed to complete it halfway through, now it doesnt even register with the computer when i turned it on. i'm using windows xp sp2, and if what i need to do requires changing a setting during startup, include a detailed description, because im lost when it comes to that.

ok, ive got it to autoplay, and show up as a drive, would you reccomend formatting it to ntfs? (its fat32 right now)
fat32 has little to no damage resistance. your choice here. i don't use it unless i'm exchanging files with some mac or old windows box. bob
so ntfs is better for one computer only needs? (so to speak)
vanishing usb hard disks daily. served fresh... bob
