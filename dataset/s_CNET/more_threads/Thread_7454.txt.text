hello, this is my first thread on the cnet forums. anyway, i plan on buying a netbook pretty soon, which is the asus eee pc 1005 hab, which includes windows xp. i plan on using it for itunes, backup storage, maybe some school work, but i think the main focus is for itunes. can the netbook i mentioned be used without problems? will itunes be limited because of the netbook hardware? i know you cant watch hd or sd video, play itunes extras and whatnot, but can i use itunes for ipod management, like restoring and downgrading and whatnot? also, just a personal preference, but can you change the color of the xp taskbar from the blue color? :p
it does that fine. yes you may have to be patient for some operations but it does work. my nephew has an emachines 250-1162 netbook and an ipod nano which he uses all the time. bob
thanks for the response. can i still change the wallpaper or the color of the xp taskbar though?
there are plentiful discussions about windows 7 basic and how to change the wallpaper in spite of how it arrives. i bet the color of the taskbar is covered too. as to windows xp, no version i know of has such a limitation or needs any work around. bob
