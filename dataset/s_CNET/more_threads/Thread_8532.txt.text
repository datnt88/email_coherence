i want to get a new monitor for my new pc. i'm looking for something no bigger than 21'/22' inches and would like to keep the price no higher than $150. so far i like the following monitors, the asus vh202t-p, and i also like the acer v223wbd. asus vh202t-p link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/ccp72142--asus-vh202t-p-20--ws-1600x900-20-0003a1-5ms-dvi-h-vh202t-p-monasuvh203r.htm acer v223wbd link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/ccp72662--acer-v223wbd-22--lcd-ws-1680x1050-black-25003a1-5-v223wbd-monace223w2r.htm
i use the acer 22&quot; lcd's at work, and they are great. excellent quality, nice looking, easy to look at all day.
the height is adjustable for asus vh242hl-p, it also has epeat certification for gov/ed qualification. link: centralcomputers.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp?product_id=72535
