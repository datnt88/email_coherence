i recently upgraded my amd4600+ to vista. i have another xp computer on my home network. the vista system can see the xp computer but the xp computer cannot see the vista. the workgroup names are the same, and both computers can ping each other and all files and folders are set to shared. what is going on?
i found the answer to my problem here:
it was the &quot;password protected sharing&quot; that needed to be turned off.
i have read the article and have set up everything on the vista system as specified and my xp system can now see the vista system on the network, but still cannot see any files. i have shared the c: drive on vista to save time, but do i need to share individual folders? the goal here is to be able to use the easy transfer option between the systems, but until the vista system is shared on the network easy transfer will not work. any ideas?
you need to enable file sharing on each individual firl you wish to share. refur to figures 5 through 9 in the following:
