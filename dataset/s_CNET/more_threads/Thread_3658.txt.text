i would like to install ie 7 on my usb drive because i want this to be seperate from my c: drive so i can test it out since it's beta. can i do this? if so, can i do this with all programs that i would want to try out before installing them on my hard drive? thanks in advance.
there are some programs, like pstart, that allow you to run applications off of a flash drive (i use it for firefox), but not all applications will work... give it a try - pstart is free. google it.
in your usb drive.it is available as a free download. if your usb drive supports u3 standard then you can also use some u3 standard portable sw in your drive. the advantage is that all the registry entries in the pc in which you use your u3 drive with portable sw are deleted when you remove the usb drive, thus leaving the pc in its previous state. ie7 does not have a portable version.
