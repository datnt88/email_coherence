hi friends, building a 1u linux server is different from building a normal tower case because 1u is equal to 1.75 inches in height and i realized that it will be working within a smaller space than with other computer cases. to this end, power supplies, fans, video cards, network cards, hard drives and cd-rom drives all have been made with a lower height requirement. so, i want to learn the process to build a 1u linux server. if anyone having idea on it, then please share with me and help me for my mission. thanks and regards, rodger hooks
so i'm locking this. p
but such servers are readily available and all you do is install your server os. no one i know builds the hardware unless you count installing it into a rack. bob
