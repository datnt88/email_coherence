hi, need some help here. i can't seem to turn on the computer sometimes, although i keep pressing the power on button. sometimes, it works, and the computer works fine. what do you guys think is the problem? im a newbie at this, so i 'd like to know what is the likely cause before i take the thing to pieces. thanks for replying!!!
some power-on switches do go bad, its not that common. the atx power supplies when pushing the power button takes time to react and its best maintain pressing until the system starts to power-on. the frt. panel power sw. is usually has a wire harness to the mtrbd. it maybe not seated fully or the crimps of connector pins are flimsy, check all that by opening case and inspect. the power supply itself maybe flaky and starting to fail. if this is a new system, use the warranty or call-in the problem. you may have other problems, but if you feel uncomfortable in fixing it, it maybe best to allow a pro at it or a &quot;trusted, but knowledgable&quot; friend at it. good luck -----willy
how old is the computer, what brand and model, processor type...etc. when you can't get it to start, if you unplug the power plug and put it back in does it make any difference. how often does it not stat up?
when you power up the pc, watch the fans and especially the ps fan. if it twitches and stops and the pc does not boot, this usually means the ps has detected an improper load and has shut down. if the fans do nothing, it could be the mentioned momentary switch. a marginal ps can do this because the startup current is higher than the run current. this could explain why it sometimes works and sometimes does not. of course make sure the ps can supply sufficient current for your hardware configuration. good luck.
