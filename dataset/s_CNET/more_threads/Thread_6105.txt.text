hi, i've decided to upgrade my existing pc. i'm having a hard time deciding which route to go this time for the first time. i was at first going to upgrade my system to one using a 925x motherboard w/pci-e, but it seems most of the reviews i've read, the socket 775 processors do not perform as expected and tend to run hot to boot! i was then thinking about waiting for the nforce4 motherboards that run on the amd 64 platform w/ pci-e support. is either of these platforms an option? or is there something better? i currently have a system with a asus p4pe 845 motherboard, a p4 2.53 processor with 512 meg of ddr pc2700 memory. one of the reasons i want to upgrade is so i can run a better agp card than what i have now (mine can run only a 4x slot card. thanks for any advise any of you can offer.
and mobo's with the nforce 4 are available. go to:  or  and read the details about them. gigabyte may be the latest to come out. if gaming is your thing, amd still wins hands down.
yeah i have a 3.4 p4 on a intel 925xcv motherboard and it idles at around 32 and games at hottest 40 i hope i helped u
