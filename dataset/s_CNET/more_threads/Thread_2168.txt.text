i have been trying all morning to reply to nerdyboy about my sony with no color red. see below. nerdy here is what i have been trying to say when i shut down the energy saver prompt shows red, green and blue, so i assumed that the monitor was not the problem how do i find the video card to check it please? sony pcrs630g, xp home i live in baja mexico and dont have easy access to techs.
go to device manager via control panel&gt;system&gt;. look at video card. look at what it says. determine card. if unsure post again. if sure, go to manufactuerer and download latest drivers. roger
roger did i mention that i am not too good at this. how do i identify the video card? i do not see these words anywhere. thanks
then look at settings in the start menu. then in there, there is control panel. when in control panel, go to system. then click the tab that says hardware. when u are in hardware, click the device manager button. after this u should see a list. in this list, you should be able to identify display adapter. click the + button to open it. identify what it says there. then go to w/e manufacturer it says and try downloading the latest drivers.
thanks nerdyboy. i am not quite that out of it. i had found all of that and have gone to radeon and the update downloads require service pack 2 which i have never installed. thanks for you help. ps i cant install service pack 2 because an idiot tried to repartition my hard drive and i lost the recovery capabilities. just as an after thought. should i just go ahead and bite the bullet and buy the start up disks from sony so i can straighten all this mess out.
