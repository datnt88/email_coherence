3825	9	108138	1237984	1237906	dagger906	6/11/05 3:05 pm	1.1185023e12	not true!	haha! where did you get all your ideas!? you've got to be kidding me! it doesn't matter which drive is the boot drive. windows xp, the software itself, supports both formats and can read from both formats. poohoo... ^_____^
