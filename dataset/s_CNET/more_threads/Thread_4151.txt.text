my dvi port on my gateway fdp2185 monitor (built april 06) has gone bad. now i have to use the vga port and there is blurriness around text (images look fantastic). native resolution 1680 x 1050. i have a nvdia 8600 gt dual dvi card with the latest driver. i'm using the dvi/vga adapter that came with this card. in xp/sp3, i have changed the smooth edges from cleartype to standard and back again. cleartype looks better than standard, but it is still blurry. is there a way to get clear text? this is my work computer and 90% of its use is completely text. i was told replacing the dvi port needs microsoldering and it is probably more cost effective to buy a new monitor.
some 180 buck 22&quot; refurb but it's hdmi and not dvi. here's a picture.  that's connected with vga and to me is very sharp. maybe you just need to fix what broke or replace it? bob
i'm fighting the urge to replace it with a dell 2408wfp. microsoft's cashback on ebay is not helping the urge either!
1. try another vga cable. 2. swap ends of the vga cable. 3. try other refresh rates (start with 60).
i did change the vga cable and it made the text some clearer. i have to use the nvidia adapter because my 8600 only has dvi ports. i'm going to get a dvi to vga cable to see if that completely clears it (fingers crossed). . i don't have the option of changing the refresh from 60.
