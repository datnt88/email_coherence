i have two old gateway pc's that i have cobbled together with spare parts. one has all of the oem software with keycodes. i have installed ubuntu on both of them. one of them is a p3 700, with 192 mb of ram and a 20 gb hard drive. the other is a p3 550 with 320 mb of ram, and 2 hard drives. os on a 10 gb and the data drive is a 20 gb. along with crt monitors, keyboards and mice and speakers, i plan on taking the machines to goodwill. unless i can find someone in need of a pc, i will take them tomorrow. any idea on value of them? they both work. the one with the least memory has a nic card, i was just surfing the internet with it a few minutes ago. the other pc only has a modem installed.
but for example, a new laptop starts at 299 so at best 1/2 that and only if there are legitimate cds for the os and what's loaded. bob
i have the gateway software package that came new with one of the machines. along with it (98se) the keycodes and gateway recovery disk. i had to put a nic card in it, clean the lint and dirt, installed a new cmos battery. i installed ubuntu on both machines. i was going to offer them to someone for $50 apiece (includes crt monitor, mouse and keyboard, speakers.) i just wondered if that was too much.
my nephew is able to ply a similar p3 1ghz etc. no display at 100 bucks so the market is out there. again, compare with ebay, craigslist, etc. bob
