my computer died. some odd reson the board died. but the power supply ram and everything else still works. i know it's weird only the board. we're talking socket 775 celeron d. the only thing i can't be certain about is the cpu. i'm getting a new board tomorrow or day after. what i'm wondering is a would a dead cpu hurt the board. if i use onboard video, 1 ram stick, plug in power to motherboard. nothing else. no hd or cd. just enough to power the board. will a dead cpu fry the board. or will it just not turn on. in other words will testing my cpu to see if it is dead or not fry the board. or is it safer not to test it and just get a new cpu. thanks, confusimo
if kyou spent more then $60 for the board i would try a new cpu or get a cheap board to test with on a bench.
i dont know if the dead processor would hurt it or not, but if you find a local computer shop, preferably one family owned and operated rather than best buy or circuit city, they will test the processor for you for about $10 and they will do a full inspection to insure its in perfect condition. its a shame to have to spend the money but then at least you will know black and white if its good or not.
once you test it...you can decide to keep or get something more consistent with the intended use. vapcmd
