hi: i have a compaq presario 5700t desktop computer, with 450mhz. i would like to upgrade to a faster mhz. can i upgrade to at least a 550mhz??? thanks for your help.
i don't think they make 550 mhz processors anymore. if you're planning to upgrade the cpu, you better upgrade the motherboard also.
technology is moving so fast, upgrading just doesn't worth the price anymore. what kind of cpu and motherboard do you have? pii goes up to 450mhz, if you have that, then you'll have to get a new piii or p4 compatible motherboard. motherboard + cpu make up most of the cost in a computer anyway. just get a new machine, it would be easier, and probably even cheaper.
actually you can find pentium iii's on ebay and pricegrabber for a good price if it's a slot 1 pentium ii box, you can run slot i pentium iii's in there (if their sub 900mhz ones, as pentium ii and pentium iii are very very close to each other in design (less difference than northwood to prescott) i would still agree with them on this though, just get a new machine
