3107	4	358359	3124379	3124380	toastguy	9/10/09 1:27 pm	1.25258922e12	haha, don't be sorry...	you've spent your valuable time to give me advice, i really appreciate it. i did find the drive said it was compatible with windows 2000/xp/vista, and when i tried to load the software it came with it wouldn't work with my version of windows. ah well. again, i think i'm calling wd. thanks again!
