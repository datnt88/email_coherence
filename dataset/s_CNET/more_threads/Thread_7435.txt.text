i have been burning movies for the past few months without complications. however, up until recently, using the same method i have always used, the dvd's no longer work. the program goes through the process of converting and burning, but the dvd can't be read by the computer or dvd player. i just recently had a virus, adware.look2me, which is removed now. could that have had something to do with it? ive tried re-installing the dvd-rom drivers and my converting/burning program but no luck. here's what i am using. comstar 16x double layer internal dvd+/-r rewriter winavi video converter someone, please help thanks
a little more work and difficulty but did you remove and reinstall the codecs? also some run into aging drives or bum media. i often try a burn at 2x on media other than what is failing. bob
all the codecs are new and i've tried slowing down the speed but no dice.
mine all of a sudden stopped as well. ugh. any fix?
