5523	2	535783	5176874	5176552	zedochok	7/29/11 2:19 pm	1.31194914e12	problem persists	i dont quite understand you, wireless router 192.168.1.1 is now dhcp enabled, rest of them are dhcp disabled. basic problem is that i san not acess 192.168.1.130 from ap#2 computers, and 192.168.1.131 from ap#1 computers. not even with ping. both aps are tp-link tl-wr543g with latest firmware, one set in router mode, another in client mode, connected properly, dhcp disabled on both.

5523	10	535783	5177687	5177100	steven haninger	7/31/11 2:54 am	1.31208084e12	about these apartments	any chance for using copper? if they're not physically attached, i'd go underground and use the proper type for that purpose. if you can diy, it could be cheaper than using all this wireless hardware and definitely more reliable.

5523	12	535783	5177836	5176381	r. proffitt	7/31/11 8:45 am	1.3121019e12	ok. let me share a setup i've used too many times.	when i need to extend my range i've used a common router but set it up as a wap. this is covered in the cnet networking forum sticky as well as google &quot;how to use a router as a wap.&quot; with that out of the way, i place this wap where it gets the best shot at reaching my other location. now on the other side i can use a gaming bridge or a bridge that i used many times as a wifi client is the wgps606 the gaming bridge or wgps606 is also placed where it has the best shot at connecting to the wap (which i used a common router) and at that point i can test connectivity by plugging into the bridge's ethernet ports. if i want to get wifi coverage in that area i add one more router as a wap and i'm done. that's my formula that i've used too many times. due to failures of those &quot;bridges&quot; i had to come up with something that i could make work. bob
5523	13	535783	5178664	5177836	zedochok	8/1/11 2:29 pm	1.31220894e12	maybe this is reason	i have read what you suggested me, and i did all like people wrote there, thing is still not working. maybe this is problem, it is my final guess: [img]  [/img] this router has only these two modes, there is not regular client mode?
5523	14	535783	5178659	5177687	zedochok	8/1/11 2:45 pm	1.3122099e12	copper	no way for wires apt1 and apt2 are not so close to each other...
5523	15	535783	5178871	5178659	steven haninger	8/2/11 1:49 am	1.31224974e12	ok, if the problem is distance and not	other physical barriers, you may also have problems getting a good wireless signal from one to the other. you'll probably need directional outdoor antennas. good luck

5523	17	535783	5179847	5179339	zedochok	8/3/11 12:17 pm	1.31237382e12	solution	yes that is the problem, few minutes ago i replaced router tp-link tl-wr543g from apt2 with regular ap with regular client mode, and in a few minutes internet is in apt2!! modes of levelone ap:[img]  [/img] thank you all for your time and efforts, and remember (because i will) that tp-link tl-wr543g cannot be used as regular client ap!
