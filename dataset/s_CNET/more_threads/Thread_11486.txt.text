i just hooked up a linksys wireless g 2.4ghz router on a gateway pc-pentium 4, 3.0ghz and 512mb ram. i'm now experiencing a major slow down or non-response in opening up programs, logging onto the internet, opening up email and spastic mouse movements (also wireless, but with two new batteries installed on 8/30). anyone know what's up with this?
i find new routers to have out of date firmware. try updating that then and if the problems continue return it as defective. bob
the wireless signal will always be slower than than the ethernet cable , wireless is affected by the enviroment , the materials of the wall in your house will affect the wireless range, also the 2,4 ghz phones cant cause interfernce. try this, go to 2wire.com and choose the speed meter option, check with your isp what's your bandwith and if this is lower than the bandwith you're paying for should be a hardware issue, if is higher there's a software problem on your computer. another thing you can try is connect a computer with ethernet cable, and see if the issue with speed still the same, if it does, you better contact your isp
