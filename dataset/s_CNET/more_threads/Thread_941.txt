14600	5	294203	2769447	2769319	razzzberri	5/9/08 8:16 am	1.21032096e12	i've installed a modem before..l	at my fl home, i've installed a pppoe (point-to-point protocol over ethernet) ethernet modem and separate wireless router on an at&t line successfully. i want to try it myself on this phone line from mickey mouse telecom, but i need to know what type wireless dsl modem works best with my mac os. this phone company charges $19.99 per month for dial-up so slow that the connection times out before pages load. its cost for the &quot;light&quot; (cheapest) dsl is $29.99, + $3.99 for modem rental. i'll only use it for 6 mos of my one year mandated contract, so instead of paying $33.98 a month for 12 months, i'll effectively be paying $67.96 per month actual usage. mickey mouse telecom has no provision for temporarily suspending service, as other companies do. i don't want to pay them 1 cent more than necessary!!
