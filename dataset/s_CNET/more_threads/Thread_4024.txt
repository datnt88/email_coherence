9852	6	198812	2140411	2139990	geebee	8/17/06 9:23 am	1.15580658e12	i actually read...	...a site recently which detailed 2d speeds, and while all the cards were stratospheric scorers, it didn't look to have moved on much from the good old days. cards which wouldn't even score in the top 100 (matrox/3dfx /xgi/videologic were even listed i think) now for 3d speed, were easily a match for more modern hardware (if i found it interesting, i'd be able to find it again! ). apparently 2d speeds have been pretty much topped out (i can't even find the link now, but remeber matrox 550 was a good &quot;old&quot; scorer) for many years with no drive for extra speeds, so any card will be adequate for what you require. here's a link detailing the x1600pro (and crossfire) fully too.  the only caveat...the power required. it's not exactly a low power device, so please make sure your psu can provide the current required. gb.

9852	8	198812	2140436	2139433	bestsealer	8/17/06 9:43 am	1.15580778e12	thanks	thanks again for all the advice. as i said, i am not a gamer, so it would appear the x1600 will do nicely for me - and the price seems right. my only concern now is the motherboard i intended to use (gigabyte ga-965p-ds4) seems to be having problems. i just heard from my dealer that gigabyte recently recalled all these boards because of a design flaw in the chipset. who knows if the next release will be stable! gonna have to do some more research on this board. again, thanks for all the advice for the video card!
9852	9	198812	2140476	2140411	bestsealer	8/17/06 9:56 am	1.15580856e12	regarding power caveat..	yes, regarding power, i just read:: power-hungry graphics if there's one area of computer hardware that is getting a bit out of hand, it's pc graphics. ati and nvidia are releasing newer and faster products at a breakneck pace -- single-card sli powerhouses, double-wide ati crossfire behemoths, nvidia's quad sli -- all seemingly designed with no heed to power consumption or heat production. if you think directx 10 will alleviate these concerns, you're dead wrong: the combined requirements of vista, directx 10, and upcoming 3d games and applications will drive gpu technology through the ceiling. companies like thermaltake are even ramping up for this increased power draw by releasing dedicated gpu power supplies. these units range from 250 to 300 watts, fit into an open 5.25-inch drive bay, and supply power exclusively to the gpu. from these wattage specifications, it's safe to assume that first-generation directx 10 cards will be power-hungry products indeed. heat production is another potential sore spot, and all indications say that cooling will be a challenge for vista-ready gpus. the only hope is that second-generation or subsequent revisions will bring directx 10 products that get us back on track with a sane balance of high performance and energy savings, much as nvidia has done with the evolution of its geforce 7600 and 7900 gpus.

9852	11	198812	2142236	2140476	geebee	8/18/06 6:27 am	1.15588242e12	i meant the x1600...	...power requirement indicated in the hardware review review :  the x1600 and modern graphics cards in general are a power hungry bunch. if you don't have the psu overhead to spare at the moment, you're looking immediately at extra expense. or you could go for one of those older cards that still do well in 2d speeds, and suck up far less power. there are a few modern cards which use less wattage though :   x-bit seems to be one of the few tech sites that actually measures current draw, which may help upgraders to avoid upseting a weaker psu. personally if the dx10 hardware coming in 2007 is going to be as bad as suspected, i suspect the electricity to power them for a year (we've had 3 prices rises in 6 months), may be more than the cost of the computers themselves! gb.
