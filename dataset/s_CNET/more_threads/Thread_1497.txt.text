i would like some advice on what keyboard i should get for my system. i am using a 60&quot; t.v. as the display for my computer, so i need to be far enough away from the screen to enjoy it. it is in the basement living room, about 15' from the couch. i want a quality wireless keyboard that won't make me bankrupt, my current wireless keyboard does not work at the range. one feature i would be interested in is any kind of illumination, glow in the dark, backlight, whatever. if it is a gaming keyboard, that would be just fine, as long as it does not cost a fortune. a gaming keyboard is not necessary, but preferable. i have looked at iogear, and they have a keyboard with a 33' range, i just don't know how well it would work, and i don't need the mouse that comes with it, i have a logitech g7 mouse. logitech has some really nice wired gaming keyboards, (the g19 and the g15 are too expensive, but the g11 might work) i just don't know how long their cords are. their wireless k350 looks really nice, but i need to know if its range is good enough. priorities: 1 - works well long range, quality. 2 - some kind of illumination. 3 - gaming grade
for range, bluetooth, range 25 to 30 feet. check spec on your unit to see if bluetooth is an option.
hello! i'm with dsi and we carry some keyboards that you would probably be interested in taking a look at. this one is ergonomic and also has a touchpad:  this one also has a touchpad and convenient media keys:  let me know if you have any questions. good luck!
