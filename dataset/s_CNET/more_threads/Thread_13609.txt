(should this be set to aes instead?) last time i had a problem getting onto the network i did a bunch of cmd codes. i did something with the dns, dchp, ping, and then did the iconfig stuff but i have no idea what i did before...i threw away my little paper with what i did. i have also flushed the dns, then tried to release/renew the ip...still nothing. what i dont know - how to fix this problem...or what is wrong thanks for all your help/comments in advance chris
