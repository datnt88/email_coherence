2839	3	587071	5429829	5429639	hellz_angel	2/25/13 2:15 pm	1.3618017e12	how so?	hi bob, i realise the &quot;importance&quot; of pressure sentivity, but i want to have the touch capability. between a medium and a small, what would you recommend? should i get an intuos5?

2839	7	587071	5429948	5429947	hellz_angel	2/25/13 6:19 pm	1.36181634e12	cont.	hi bob, that seems fair enough that you say ill have more control with the medium, although for the amount i will be using it, is it really worth it? i have never used a graphics tablet before; this would be my first. so again, here is my question: will a small be big enough for my needs? thanks so much bob, - hellz
2839	8	587071	5429971	5429948	hellz_angel	2/25/13 6:29 pm	1.36181694e12	remember	hey again, please note: the wacom bamboo create (  ) is the equivalent of the medium intuos5, but for around $150. would this be a better idea for my first tablet? thanks again, - hellz

2839	12	587071	5430288	5430312	hellz_angel	2/26/13 2:50 pm	1.3618902e12	p.s	hi again, i know im really horrible with thinking of everything to put in my message.. anyway, here are some points i was considering: - i intend to carry the tablet to college every day, so an intuos5 small would be more portable than a medium bamboo create. - the intuos5 small has about the same ratio for corner-to-corner sweeping as my mouse - having a small intuos5 will help me determine if i want to go for a medium or a large later on - the bamboo create has much less pressure levels, less nibs, less buttons, but a much lower price than the intuos5 small right now, i just need to know if a i should get a medium bamboo create, or a small intuos5. thanks, - hellz

2839	15	587071	5430391	5429547	r. proffitt	2/26/13 6:28 pm	1.36190328e12	the problem is you have not used a tool like this before.	it's partly why folk go to art school. sure you could pick up a brush and paint but there's nothing like diving in and doing. also with a little helpful advice. since you have never used such before you can't know if this tool is going to be what you like. so price is the best decision maker here. that way you can see if it's the tool you dreamed of and as far as size or other features go, it won't matter when you select your next device. bob
2839	16	587071	5430799	5430391	hellz_angel	2/27/13 4:20 pm	1.361982e12	thanks a lot!	hi bob, finally decided on a puchase: i got the wacom bamboo create pen and touch. thanks for all your help, ronan
