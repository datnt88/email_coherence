i have windows 7 ultimate 64-bit with a ga-ep45-ud3p (rev 1.0/1.1) motherboard. when i play games i get a bsod stop 0x0000001e. it occurred to me i didn't install all my drivers or the new bios for my system since updating to windows 7 64-bit. i have installed all current hardware drivers, but when i try to install the bios it says it is not compatible with 64-bit and to contact the company. i have contacted them, but without a reply. is windows just saying it isn't compatible when i try to run the update in windows, but really is compatible if i used a disk to update the bios? thank you!
the ability to update the bios while windows is running is a very new trick. i'm not trying to offend you but if you think back just a few years such updates were done with dos boot diskettes for years and arcane command lines. it's improved but i have no qualms with a boot cd or diskette to do this update. bob
i just updated the bios on my giga-byte p55-ud3r while running win 7 pro 64 bit and it went without incident. vapcmd
thanks for the input, i appreciate it. however, i think my question was misunderstood, it's an odd question. i was trying to ask if, since i tried to update the bios within windows, would it give me a message stating the bios update was not compatible with 64-bit windows, even though it was actually compatible if i used an alternative method to windows. so in essence, should i try to update the bios with a usb drive (since that's all i have) even though when i tried to update within windows it said it was not compatible? hopefully that's a little more clear.
still a very new trick. i expect it to not always work. hope that's clearer. bob
floppy disk but when i ran the program ...the file was too large for a for a floppy disk. so i decided to try the @bios update program running under windows. let us know. vapcmd
