i plan on upgrading my 4 year old enpower desktop and i would like to know if there is any way to copy everything from my old pc to the new pc so i can avoid having to re-install all my programs and network software. i plan on staying with windows xp pro. i have a very small business and i use my desktop as a server with two other computers in the building as workstations.
1. copy the drive with something like g4u's copydisk (see google for items like this in my post) and then look up xp repair install to repair the os. 2. use alohabob. read  bob
but it will not move installed software.
well, sort of but it's not a good idea. you could simply pull out the old hard drive and put it in the new machine and boot from that. this will work but it's not a good idea because your installation of xp is set up for your old machine. xp is actually smart enough to cope with this (barely), it's pretty good at installing all the new drivers for your motherboard, etc, but the old drivers and stuff tend to hang around. basically you'll end up with a wounded operating system and may have more serious problems too. you're really better off rebuilding the whole lot as you'll have a more stable setup in the long run.
not a great idea! youll have driver conflit issues, and is better to just reformat. you could buy a new harddrive and have your old set as a slave or 2nd sata driver to keep the files running at hand.
