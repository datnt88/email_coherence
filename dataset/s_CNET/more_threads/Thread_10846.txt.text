i have an olevia 27 inch monitor/tv. i have it connected to my hp media center m7360n via the vga connection and it works perfectly well. on black friday i decided to get a bigger monitor/tv but i am cheap, so i bought the emerson 32 inch that wal-mart had on sale for $388, and then gave my old tv to my roommate. i thought i was getting a good deal, however, now, maybe not. the problem is my pc has no hdmi port and the new tv has no vga port. i tried connecting them using rca cables with no luck. i think that problem lies with the pc as the dvd player connected to the new tv with no problem. my question is, do i have to buy a new computer with an hdmi slot, or is it possible to upgrade my existing computer? i would appreciate any help. thanks.
here is my suggestion, just get a vga to hdmi cable and hook it up and you should be good.they are only like $6.00 so it isn't a pricey fix,just run to fry's or get on online.i hope this helps. i've never done this with vga to hdmi to a tv, but i did this with a dvi to vga to a regular monitor.
two possible fixes. find an adapter that matches your needs(the cheap fix) or buy a new video card. if video card, you need to disable the on-board video, install new card with required ports and s/w to finish install. being a media center system may complicate things, imho. of course you can google away for others that may have fixed a similar issue. believe me, this hd tv stuff is getting popular but attaching to old systems can be a no go w/o added attention or expense.  tada -----willy
