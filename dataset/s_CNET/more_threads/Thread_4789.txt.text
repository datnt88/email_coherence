my dad has a large library of dvd's, and the dvd players in my house are really beginning to suck. so i thought for this xmas i would buy him an apple tv. what i'd like to do is buy a large hd (like a tb or something), and then rip his dvd movies to the drive so it can be connected to a computer and accessed by appletv whenever he wants to watch something. does anyone know what i could do to get this done quickly, because i don't have the time to sit on my mbp and rip 300+ movies to my hard drive and then drag them to an external hd... i was hoping there was some hardware that could convert dvds to digital format within minutes i could use. thanks, alegoo92
i've never seen such a thing. even at shows and in the back rooms of labs.
yeah bob i am with you on this one for sure, fast? uh even if it is possible transfer rates are such methinks he would be there for a while. maybe an esata hook up or usb3 but that would require considerable hardware modifications, sounds unlikely.
and i was surprised it didn't reduce the time as much as i expected. my thought on this is that at usb 2.0 we are getting close to the &quot;media speed&quot; of your common hdd. i'll leave this to others and you to research hdd media speed. what you want may be possible and definitely can be done on non-drm dvds but we can't discuss drm removal (see the forum policies.) what some don't get is that when you get a commercially made video dvd (for this example) the license or rights may limit it to play from said media. i would not want to take on any court case about rips to hdd since too often i find folk will dispose or gift away the dvd and forget to dispose of the digital copy. so with that we can state that if we are a little more patient then what you ask is possible. but i've yet to see a dvd 4.7gb media read in single digit minutes. bob
