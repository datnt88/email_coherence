until a few hours ago, my intel imac happily connected to the internet via my timecapsule. my windows laptop still happily connects to the internet via my timecapsule. however, the imac now won't connect. on the imac, when i select my network from the list of available networks from the airport icon in the top menu bar, i get a dialogue box that asks for my wpa password (which the mac used to just remember for me). when i enter it and click ok, it tries to connect for a few seconds and then gives me a &quot;connection timeout&quot; message. when i open airport utility on the imac, it says it can't find any wireless devices. i have tried shutting off everything (modem, timecapsule, mac), waiting, and then switching everything back on. what else can i do?
did you ever get a resolution? if so, please advise. my imac and iphone 4 suddenly won't connect to my time capsule now - but my macbook and ipad will.
update. resolved the issue. found a post in the macrumors.com forum that had a suggestion i hadn't tried... went into airport settings, and wireless at radio channel selection - changed from auto to manual. manually changed the radio frequencies to channels 161 and 5. hit ok, then update and once the tc rebooted, everyone is getting along fine again!
i have the same problem but there is no such thing as a &quot;radio channel selection&quot; in network diagnostics for airport. did you mean something else?
the post from moncton_2011 is telling you to change the settings in airport utility. open airport utility and chose manual setup. under the summary tab you can change the radio channel.
sorry, i meant the wireless tab.
