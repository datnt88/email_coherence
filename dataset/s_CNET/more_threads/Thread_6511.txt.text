modems don't have an ip address, routers do. modems have a mac address. are you sure this is not a router? router access ip address will either be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1.
hi, i too have the alcatel dsl modem. i donot know how to find the mac address of it? it is not written on the label. please let me know how to find it?
as i can see if you tracert to say  the first or second ip address will be your adsl/router/bridge. but only on some models. you could try that exploit about the expert logon. bob
