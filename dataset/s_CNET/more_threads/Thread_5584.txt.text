on my current machine i have two 500gig sata hard drives both in working condition, one running windows 7 and the other used for storage. now i also have an 80gig ide hard drive running ubuntu; which i have from my old machine. the 80gig ide ran perfectly with a different sata hard drive in the old machine (all i had to do was switch the boot order to use either ubuntu on the 80gig ide or windows 7 on the old sata hard drive). i just recently tried bringing the 80gig ide drive over to my new computer but it doesn't seem to be working. the bios recognizes it as a 2500mb drive for some absurd reason. any ideas on how to get this to work? additional info: mother board: asus a8-ne jumper settings for the ide drive: cs
some asus boards, and probably many others, have hard drive controllers that are either/or but not both sata and ide. i've seen this mainly if a raid configuration is possible. if you select to use sata, the corresponding ide ports become unusable. check your manual to see if this is the case.
thanks for the suggestion i double checked the manual and it appears i should be able to run both sata and ide concurrently. while browsing the manual i came across this, &quot;if the hard disk was already formatted on a previous system, the setup bios may detect incorrect parameters. select [manual] to manually enter the ide hard disk drive parameters.&quot; after looking up the parameters for the hard drive, i tried to manually enter the ide hard disk drive parameters; however, i was not able to do so. the sectors, heads, and cylinders all had adjustable values but when i set them to the proper values and hit enter, they just reset to the incorrect values. any other suggestions? thanks
