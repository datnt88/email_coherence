need some help.....brought this esatap bracket..... but its seems like my hdd(2.5&quot;) cannot be detect from my mobo when the hdd is plug in....but the hdd is spinning, cos when i pull out the cable...i can hear the spinning and vibration stop.... tried on a fren pc (hp) and it works my mobo dfi lanparty ut p45 t2rs ich10r and jmb363 and my power supply is 550w...more than enough.... do i need to do anything to my bios? any bro here can help....
i have an external esata rail in my hp8100cto. it requires that i boot with the external esata drive powered up and connected. if i wait until windows has booted, it will not be detected. would like to find a reliable esata hot swap program that works all the time.
regardless of disconnecting the esata cable, the external drive case supporting this 2.5&quot; drive must have power from an adapter. the esata cable supplies data, not power.
