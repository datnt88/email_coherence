i cannot get printer to work, it prints test page then says cyclic redundancy? tried uninstalling, disabling avg virus program. help?
kind of vague as to what else may be contributing but google search supplied this:
crc error means the data getting to the printer is not the data that was sent to the printer, saying either the port is bad or the cable is bad, or the printer has a defective port. can you try the printer cable with some other device? you have given us no clue about your hardware or software, what is connected, what os, nothing, leaving us with little to go on.
