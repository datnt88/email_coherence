ok first i am srry if i am posting in the wrong section because this is my first time on the cnet boards. i proble is as follows: i have 1 80 gb hdd and 1 40 gb hdd. i want to make 3 total partions (each 40gb) for a seperate os install. if i use a boot loader, can i still boot the the 2ed 40 gb hdd? or do all the partions need to be on the intial 80 gb hdd so i can boot to them? thank you.
it does make a difference. also if you are willing to buy a boot manager or not. bob
i will have 2 win xp pro copies, 1 win server 2003 copy and maybe a linux (unknown distro at this time) down the road. as for buying the boot manager, if is ts affordable (under 50-60 american.
in that case, the xp and 2003 boot manager will be ok. when you get a current linux distro, a new boot manager (most likely grub) will handle the boot management. if you get some old linux distro, then you have to deal with it. bob
