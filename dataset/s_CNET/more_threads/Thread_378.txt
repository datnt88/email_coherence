(we don't live near real techs.) i opened the machine but i can't figure out which is the model no. for the mother board. but i have some numbers of the mother board that might help. intel 810, intel 82801aa, intel 82810aa. the model no. of the modem is md-cn5614ch. the model no. of the sound card is ct4750 or mm-ct4751. sincerely, &quot;the tech of the day&quot;
