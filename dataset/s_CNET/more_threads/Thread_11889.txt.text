i just bought a samsung 940bw monitor but it has wavy lines i find out that this is due to an electrical issue. i want to know which device would stop this issue? i have a ups and a voltage regulator, what else do i need?
i had an identical problem. for me, it was interference from a cable tv wire that caused it. i've unplugged the coaxial, and am trying to come up with some other solution.
but i find it strange that a coax-cable (very low voltage, well shielded) can interfere with a monitor cable. maybe somebody can explain? kees
