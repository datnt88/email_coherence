12041	2	310198	2868573	2868563	jandss	9/27/08 1:10 pm	1.222521e12	yes	i loaded the bios default settings but it didn't fix the problem - still showing the drive as primary slave. jandss

12041	4	310198	2868894	2868594	jandss	9/28/08 3:52 am	1.22257392e12	disabled the	onchip sata bootrom and onboard promise controller after having reset to default settings. the cable is connected to the drive using the end connector (black) and the jumpers are set to cs in accordance with the picture on the drive and the maxtor website. the computer is still registering the drive as primary ide slave.

12041	8	310198	2869702	2869215	jandss	9/29/08 9:00 am	1.2226788e12	battery now replaced.	i rebooted, reset the bios as per above postings and drive still shows as pri slave.
