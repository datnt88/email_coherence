hi there. at work we have 2 desktops running windows nt not the fastest machines in the world but they are being replaced shortly. anyways the problem is we cannot get an lcd to work on either of them. they both have matrox dual head display graphics cards and work perfectly with crt monitors. when you connect a flat screen to them there is no signal at all. is there a setting in bios that needs to be changed or is it cos the systems are so old? to be honest i'd rather not touch the bios and settings like that cos like i say they are work pc's and if i bugger it up i'll have me nuts chewed off. just thought this was a bit weird as i have never seen this problem before in all my years of computing ? cheers
lcds won't work with those graphics cards. check with the manufacturer of the cards since you didn't give us full specs. and life goes on... jack
did you read anywhere in the manual that came with the monitors about setting them up to use a vga signal? are you using an adapter to go from the dvi connector to a vga connector? have you adjusted the properties in the video card to a resolution and refresh rate that the lcd monitor will support prior to hooking it up? a little more info might be helpful as i'm just suggesting general ideas.
