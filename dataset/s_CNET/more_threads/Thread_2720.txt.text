my daughter tripped over hdmi cable connected to my video card. since that happend my pc has been turning itself off. to make things funny it only happen when standing. when i put pc on the side it works fine. i replaced video card and power supply unit, no good. it looks to me, there is some loose connection or something gets overheat, but how can i figure out what?
open case and place it where it seems not to work. using some non-conductive probe, plastic stick or pencil(erarer end) wiggle or jiggle this or that and see if it makes a difference. i would also swap out the hdmi cable, those are simple cables. it helps to know what's what, pc? video card? etc.. there also the possibility the mtrbd. has been compromised, minor crack or component in some fashion, unless you can fix, replacement is only option if found so. tada -----willy
use some supporting devices to make the loose connection tight.
