my daughter has a gateway system, that's about 5 years old. she was getting memory error messages, so we increased the memory to 768. she is still getting the messages and must shut down her system, as it keeps locking up. any suggestions?
by posting in the hardware forum, you must be suspect of a hardware issue. but there is no detail in your post for me to suspect hardware issues yet. if you feel it's a software error (more likely), try a post with more details in one of the os forums. we have xp, windows 98, me, linux and mac. bob
be aware that virtual memory does not necessarily denote a hardware problem persay as much as an o/s problem. the virtual memory is an area on the hard drive the operating system uses as if it were ram.
figment virtual memory defined adjust the virtual memory setting from microsoft. with 768mb of ram you may have other problems. spyware/virus, too many applications running at start up, incompatable memory. bill
