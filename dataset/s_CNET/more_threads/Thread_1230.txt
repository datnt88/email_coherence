9053	6	281489	2690140	2689885	ramarc	1/27/08 9:00 am	1.2014244e12	let's go to the xps 600 gospel (aka documentation)	from dell's support website:  maximum memory: 2 gb or 8 gb note: see &quot;addressing memory configurations&quot; to verify the amount of memory available to the operating system.  if using a 32-bit operating system such as microsoft windows xp, your computer will support a maximum of 2 gb of memory . if you are using a 64-bit operating system, your computer will support a maximum of 8 gb (2-gb dimms in each of the four slots) of memory. sorry, but you max out at 2gb.
9053	7	281489	2690313	2690065	angryinch	1/27/08 11:35 am	1.2014337e12	you're right nothing busted	thank you for the time and info rob, honestly thanks to this forum i now know whats going with my computer. now to see if i can send the memory back. thanks again.
9053	8	281489	2690320	2690140	angryinch	1/27/08 11:51 am	1.20143466e12	now i see what you mean	thats what i get for trusting the manufacturers of both the computer and the operating system that runs it to tell me what i need to know about their product. thank you for your time and your ability to state the obvious. i use computers every day and i'm almost always able to fix my own issues but this time i got the idea in my head that i could run 4gb of ram on my computer, of course this idea was given to me by a salesman selling ram of course. anyway, thank you for your help and now i'll sit back and wait to see if the apps i use will ever be compatible with an 64bit os.

9053	12	281489	2701083	2700970	vapcmd	2/9/08 5:06 pm	1.20257676e12	2gb ram	while the mfg could guess which os you're going to use, they don't know for sure what os and what version of the os you will be installing. and with 4 dimm slots, folks can start with 2 @ 256mbs, 2 @ 512mbs, 2 @ 1gb or 4 @ 512mbs ... depending on budget. vapcmd ps...ddr2 ram hasn't always been this cheap.
