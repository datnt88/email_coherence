i have narrowed my desktop search down to 2 gateway computers. the perfect one for my needs seems to be the sx2840. it is a great computer for the price and performance you get. but, since i have $600 in bestbuy gift cards and they do not carry this gateway model, i am having a hard time deciding what to do. they do however carry the dx4831-01e for a great price. both computers seem very similar (cnet gave the sx2840 slightly better reviews) so my question is, what is the main difference between these computers? and am i going to be dissapointed with going with the dx instead of the sx??? any advice would be great. thanks, chris

to be a bit beefier with more weight, larger power supply, more pci slots, one more usb port and such. the rest is identical. the i3 cpu is a nice choice over the older core 2 duo and even older machines. sounds like a nice machine. no 3d card but there is a slot for one! bob
i may go with the dx since i have all the credit at bb. i guess the tower is bigger on the dx, but i have plenty of room so that is not a concern.
