hi - i want to purchase a tablet say between 150 and 250 dollars so i can work with my grand daughter on her homework, play games with her etc. she's more technical than i am so i want it to be easy for me to use - any suggestions??
mam, please allow me to share my two-cents. your requirements seem a short order. 1.
sorry but the tablets in that price range miss quite a bit of functionality for &quot;homework.&quot; given the word homework and that you don't have word or similar and printing is still in its infancy, this is a bad idea. for now, stick to what you use today. bob
i see i have more to investigate and think about. thank you.
i see that i have to investigate more clearly my requirements and what i can do with the galaxy. and also take a closer look at the ipad and the cost of earlier models. many thanks for your time.
