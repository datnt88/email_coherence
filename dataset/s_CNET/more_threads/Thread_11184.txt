(yes, all drivers were updated) i pulled the video card, uninstalled the drivers and now ie 6.0 crashes every 45min. even while i was typing in this forum. (went to notepad to type the draft.) i am conerned that maybe there is a power issue????? i did have to use some y calbes on the power side to accomodate all of the peripherals. i also noted that when the radeon card was installed that the temps on the cpu were around 120f, now they are around 105f. am i draining a 450w power supply with these specs? how about the temp? is the motherboard too cheap? thanks in advance for you time...

(first thing i actually did) i will pick up a new ps and see if that works. i am still a little concerned about the motherboard being on the cheapy side as well. tough to rule out something when your faith in it is declining :-/
