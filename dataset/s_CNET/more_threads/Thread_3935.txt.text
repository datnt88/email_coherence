i'd like to get a nook hd - love the screen resolution and i do a lot of reading. it seems to have less glare than the nexus 7&quot; tablet. but, i can't figure out how to get files from my camera onto the nook without doing it via computer. when i'm on the road, i don't want to take the computer, i want to take the nook. the canon g1x camera uses a regular size sd card, and the nook hd as a micro sd card reader. the camera does have a/v out and hdmi, which i could probably hook up to the nook via adapters but i don't know if the nook will be able to read the files or recognize them so i could save them onto the nook. the nook has a proprietary usb cable which i could hook into a card reader/adapter, but again, i don't know if the software exists on the nook to recognize and manage the files. any suggestions? thanks.
i own a few eyefi cards and i have a few tablets but not the nook hd. just an older nook. my nook color as well as the nook hd have a microsd slot. so you can check out  it appears you can see the pictures of standard jpeg. sorry but i don't have the nook hd so i can't do more here. -&gt; parting comment. if support is that bad they can't answer your questions, why are you considering their product? bob
and put it in the camera and when your done you can pop the micro sd card out and insert it into the nook micros sd slot.
yes you can get micro sd adapters, i have a couple of them, i believe i purchased them at fry's several years ago.
