i know wow will play fine on a macbook pro, but i am curious how well it plays on a lower level macbook. has anyone had any experience with this? i know veronica the adoreable on the buzz out loud podcast was going to look into it, but i haven't heard anything solid about the gaming performance of the macbook. obviously i know the macbook pro is the better way to go, i just dont want to shell out the $2500 for one if i dont need to. thanx:)
i think what with the specifications on the macbook it's not a very graphically intensive machine like the macbook pro. however, we can wait to see the results from veronia. or we can say that since on the apple website it states that it can run games but not graphically intensive games (go into software and games) like the pro. sorry but no luck on wow i think.
i'm sure wow will be fine on the macbook, considering that: a) it's intel native; b) it's not the most graphically intensive game out there; c) it runs well enough on my 2.5 year old ibook g4 (800 mhz) d) runs great on 2x1.8 ghz powermac g5 i'd save the cash.
