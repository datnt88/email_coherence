14280	4	159895	1775977	1775135	willy	2/27/06 9:21 am	1.14103206e12	uhhhh?	in power supplies all too often more than one componet can be at fault. thus a whole circuit is comprised even if the obivous is found. alot can happen as you found a bad &quot;diode&quot;, that's not always good to fix and return as the psu is &quot;weaken&quot; and could easily blow again. i suggest, just replace the psu and make it a higher wattage one. this is the best advise i can pass on as a decent psu of at least 500w+ even if generic or a known namebrand of 400w+(more than 420w) is goint to be needed. unless you stress test the psu, then repair for best results, but rememeber when you return it to the system all those componets/devices dempendant upon it have already suffered one blow-out, can they another? plus, keep an eye on it if problem crop-up soon enough(30-days or less). tada -----willy

14280	8	159895	1777885	1777750	strickjh2005	2/28/06 6:03 am	1.14110658e12	there is a difference.	in most cars when the motor conks out and needs replacement, it is cheaper to buy a new car than to replace the motor. if you can jerry rig it to work for a while, when it breaks down again the car most likely won't explode. it will simply need more motor repair. in a computer everything is very sensitive to incorrect voltages and amperage. an incorrect soldering in the psu can cuase a short. i have seen a fualty psu kill a mobo, proc, videocard and all the hdds at once. in this case, a new psu is usually 1/10th the cast of the rest or less. put it in prospective. that is a tiny cost.
