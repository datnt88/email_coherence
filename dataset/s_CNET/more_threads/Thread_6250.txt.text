whilst reinstalling my tevion dvb-t 100 digital tv program after a system reinstal, i got following message:- &quot;access violation at address 004fde72 in module &quot;dvtr.exe&quot;. read of address 00000000&quot; can anyone please help? after trying to instal about six times, i contacted the manufacturer's help line but they can't help. i have used this before without any problems. i use xp professional (sp3)
i take it that no-one is familiar with this type of fault. is that error reference something that could be fixed in the registry?
only the author of the application may be able to tell you why it did that. can you go back to when it worked?
