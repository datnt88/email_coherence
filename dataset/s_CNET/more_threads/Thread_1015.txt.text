hi guys, i have a fujitsu-siemens p4 3.2ghz, 512mb ram, 160gig hdd, and a high speed dvd + rewriteble cd rom. the problem i have is that whenever i want to read a cd or intstall new software off a cd, it freezes the computer and i have to reboot the computer. it does finally read the cd after 3 or 4 reboots. one of the problems with the fijitsu-siemens is there is no reboot button, so you have to switch the computer off at the back and then on again. first question is, is this not bad for the computer. second question is, is there a speed setting for the cd rom, because is the cd rom reading the cd at the wrong speed and so causing it to freeze. i hope someone has heard of this problem and can help me. i'm a novice with computers so be gentle. ha ha ha!
this sounds like an os or driver issue. in fact, that's a very new machine and you should be able to pester the supplier/support to fix it for you. all the fujitsi based systems do have a reset but may not wire it up. later you can research this and inspect the motherboard to find the reset and add that button.  notes a reply for you. bob
&quot;you have to switch the computer off at the back and then on again.&quot; or you hold the power button on the front from 4 to 11 secconds... why this isn't in the user manual with the machine is a mystery. bob
