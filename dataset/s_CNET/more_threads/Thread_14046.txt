(i have the game) well for ati, at least a 9600 or 9800 pro. nvidia, the requirements are steep, ea recomends at least a 5700 or greater so i would go at least a 6600gt or 6800 you might have to upgrade your power supply if you choose the 6800  thats the 6800  6600gt  9800 pro those are all great cards. konny
