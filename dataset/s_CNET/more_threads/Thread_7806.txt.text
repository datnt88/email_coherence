i'm building my first pc which will be an htpc connected to my hdtv. prime concerns are noise and ability to play 1080p movies off hdd. my question is, what do i need to consider when building from parts? i think i made sure all parts would work but am i missing anything? here's what i plan on using (all from newegg.com): in win bp655.200bl black mini-itx desktop computer case 200w power supply model #:bp655.200bl item #:n82e16811108196 asrock h67m-itx lga 1155 intel h67 hdmi sata 6gb/s usb 3.0 mini itx intel motherboard model #:h67m-itx item #:n82e16813157238 intel core i3-2100t sandy bridge 2.5ghz lga 1155 35w dual-core desktop processor bx80623i32100t model #:bx80623i32100t item #:n82e16819116394 g.skill 4gb (2 x 2gb) 240-pin ddr3 sdram ddr3 1333 (pc3 10600) dual channel kit desktop memory model f3-10600cl8d-4gbhk model #:f3-10600cl8d-4gbhk item #:n82e16820231180 i plan on using a 640gb wd caviar blue i have on hand and windows 7 home premium. not sure which rf keyboard/mouse i'll use, maybe one with a trackpad to keep it simple. does anyone see any potential issues with my setup? seems straightforward but i'm a pc builder noob. thanks for the help in advance!
i did this years ago and your list is fine. but i went back to simple less power and wallet hungry solutions like the apple tv, boxbee and roku. the clutter is less and it's all good. bob
thanks. i was looking at boxee, appletv, and roku (no internal storage); popcorn hour a-210, dune hdi, ps3, and xbox (not a perfect fit for one or another reason and guis received some complaints); and small form factor htpcs like asus eee 1021, zbox ad-02, and others with amd fusion e-350 apu (expensive for what it can do). i'm probably going to pull the trigger on the purchase in a few days and appreciate you looking the config over.
be able to transcode on-the-fly and playback existing av formats with the sandy bridge setup. don't need 4gb but if cheap, won't hurt. gskill not my favorite brand. consider a larger case with side fans for better ventilation, otherwise cpu and psu fans will become noisy if they work too hard. throw in a bd reader so that you have a straight answer when a visitor asks &quot;so how do you play blu-ray in this thing&quot;?
