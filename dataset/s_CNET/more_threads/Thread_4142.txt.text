i have a acer aspire one netbook and was wondering if would it be able to power the usb powered wd my passport hard drive 250gb.
i can power a 2.5&quot; external with my lenovo netbook but bought a powered cd/dvd external device so why should the acer not work. if need be, there are usb cables with an extra power pigtail that will plug into a second usb port for additional power.
thanks for the reply!!!! i called the company and they said 100% it would work.
