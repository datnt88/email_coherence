i have just purchased an external floppy drive for my desktop(vista), when i try to view a floppy disk that whas created on my laptop(xp) it tells me that the floppy needs formatting, of course this will delete all information on the floppy, when i did try to format on the desktop after a few seconds it tells me that windows was unable to format, i need access to the information on the floppy, does anybody know what the problem is and how to fix it, regards
if the floppy reads on other machines, this new drive is dead.
no, the drive works fine with a new floppy, i formatted a disk and saved work to it, it will not read the floppy disks that were formatted on my lapyop
floppies are notoriously unreliable. certainly not suited for long-term storage. but a good (albeit somewhat oldfashioned, slow and low capacity) way to transfer files between machines that don't have internet or usb. all you can try: read the diskette on your laptop and see if that recognizes it. that's not impossible, although unlikely. then transfer the data using mail or usb-stick. this is the umpteenth (if not more) proof that having data on one place only is an invitation to the gods of it to destroy it and lose it. kees
there are some worms that alter the boot area of floppies and you get this sort of complaint. but if new diskettes work fine and diskettes from other machines are fine but not from this laptop then you found the problem.
