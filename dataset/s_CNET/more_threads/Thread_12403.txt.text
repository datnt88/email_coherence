i'm looking for a expansion slot expander card. for example: 1 pci express to 2 pci (i know these exist but i dont know where to buy one) or 1 sata to 2 satas etc any ideas??
on the pci buss each slot has it's own interrupt to the pci chipset controller. a slot expander can't add this needed signal. similar issues for pci express. as to sata, you might look at adding drives on usb 2.0. not as fast but pretty fast. bob
in the dell gx260 desktop there is a card that splits a pci express to 2 pcis. i know they work, exist etc, b/c i've used both at once. i dont know how, believe me i thought a/b exactly what you said, then i put an ethernet card and a firewire card in the slots and used them simultaneously. so i know they work...just dont know how or where to get one.
the maker of the machine has to design both pieces. this is not something in the basic intel design. i can see where people may think it's a standard. as to getting the part, you just revealed where. dell. call and order it. will it work? bob
