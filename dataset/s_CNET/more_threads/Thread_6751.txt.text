dear all, i am very new to this overclocking and recently i upgraded my pc to core i5 2310 and intel dh61ww. i would like to overclock my cpu. i studied many forums and threads but couldnt find any of the given settings in my bios. some one please explain in detail how to overclock the given combination (i would be so happy if you could explain along with the terms in bios). i have one more doubt like how to increase cpu voltage in my bios. thanks in advance.... ios id string is given as beh6110h.86a in intel site mobo // processor:  [...] de=i5-2310 can i also overclock the intel hd 2000 graphics that came along with my i5.
most of the folks that visit these forums are not interested in overclocking......they just want the machine to run and not give them any fuss. if this was a car forum these folks are not interested in changing carbs/cams/exhaust to make the car faster. they want the car to start. when they step on the gas they want the car to go. when they step on the brake they want the car to stop. that's it. the folks here might be able to help with removing some dead weight the machine is dragging around......that's a backward way of overclocking.
read overclocking advice and you find we found some items that were in conflict and dogging their machine.
