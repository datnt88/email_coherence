ok pretty much all i need to know, we have no idea honestly. not really that good with some hardware. so far we have a canon 712 cartridge but no idea what to use before we break the seal on the box
i did not find such a model at canon.com there was a ufr but does not matter. i find we must have the exact model to avoid wasted searches. bob
locate the decal/sticker that denotes your model# and then visit the canon support website and locate that info. many refill ink vendors offer &quot;replacements(refills) or new oem&quot; ink carts as well. that info is on the ink cart itself or packaging. there should be no mystery in finding those details to proceed forth. tada -----willy
