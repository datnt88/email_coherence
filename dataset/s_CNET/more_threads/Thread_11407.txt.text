hello, i'm in the market to buy a netbook for web-surfing and checking email. can someone please recommend a 10'' netbook that can play hulu content with no issues? or should i look at lower end laptops? thank you in advance.
it's the old one with xp, 1gb ram. ok, it works but i'd like to see it on the newer machines. ask others to try it.
the new hp mini 311 with nvidia ion graphics performance has no problem streaming flash videos such as hulu, check out a review here,
