i had bought a dell computer a while back. ive changed out a lot of parts but the mobo has only pci slots. i have a pentium 4. and on newegg ive looked at some mobo that only say pentium. if it fits the same slot would the processor work.
having the same slot doesn't guarantee compatibility. what dell model do you have? what's your goal?
im hoping to upgrade my computers ram and graphic card slots. all it has are 2 184 slots. and then 2 pci slots. i want to be able to upgrade my graphics to pci express and 4gb of ram. a 2004 dimension desktop. it has a pentium 4 processor. i don't know what slot size. what do i look for to find that out.
a computer model number is something like &quot;dell dimension 8400.&quot; what's yours? once you know the model number, you can enter it (or the dell service tag) at support.dell.com to get the rest of the info. cpu-z and everest home edition are utilities you can download to learn your motherboard make & model number. this is all moot, imo, because there have been so many computer developments over since 2004 that you really will want to purchase or build an entirely new system.
