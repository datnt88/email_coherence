this is the config i have selected based on my budget. intel pentium 3.2 intel 945 g chipset board memmory:-corsair or transcend 2gb 533 mhz ddr-2 hdd 160 gb seagate monitor 17'inch flat crt samsung 793s lite-on sohw-1673s dvd writer atx cabinet with 400 watts smps altec lansing atp3 speakers geforce 6800 gs 256mb pci-e card tv tuner card: - play tv @p7000 ( internal ) pixel view ( suggest a better card under 100 $ ) i want this computer for gaming (play all latest games at decent resolution) and also wanna use this as a media center pc. i will be using windows xp with mce 2005 and then switching over to vista when it arrives. since i will be using my computer for watching/recording tv i want a system that doesn't make any noise. can someone here tell me whether the p4 chip or the graphics card make a lot of noise and if so is there any way to reduce it???? noise during gameplay is okay though.only wanna keep noise down while watching/recording tv. this is the first time i am building a new computer.please let me know of any combatibility issues or what should be changed . also is it better to build or buy a media center system that can play games? also please state whether this config would be enough for vista. also does it make any difference whether i use 400 mhz or 677 mhz ram on my pc??
i have a p4 630 3ghz and a leadtek 6800gs extreme pci-x. i built the system about 2 months ago. initially i had some noise problems with this setup. my computer is in my bedroom so i wanted quiet. first off the 6800gs is almost silent. i looked at a number of cards from different makers and chose the leadtek because of reports that it was quiet. i have to shine a flashlight at the fan to make sure its spinning. the intel heatsink/fan is another story. not only is it loud, it doesn't work well. i was idleing at 48c with fan cranking. i tried using arcric silver 5 and got the temps to 41c. replaced it with a arctic cooler freezer pro 7 and realized that my 120mm case fans were really pretty quiet. the high pitched fan noise disapeared with the hs/f and my temps idle at 31-33c and 45c under high load. replaced stock case fans with aspire 120mm and now i can barely hear a humming.
i've got a similar setup and scarchunk is bang on the money. the artic freezer pro 7 is (imo) the best after-market coolor for a p4. it's cool and quiet (to steal a phrase) and cheap ($35). unless you're absolutely sold on a 6800gs, take a look at current pricing on an x850xt. both it and the 6800gs are starting at $170 on newegg. but the x850xt is significantly faster out the box (no tweaking necessary). it's fan is a bit noisier (but artic makes a silencer for it also).
i'm running patriot ddr2/667 at 4-4-4-12 (spd is 5-5-5-15) in one pc and geil ddr2/533 in another. from the mem tests i've tried and the reviews i've read, name brand ddr2 with spd of 533: 4-4-4-12 will run at 667: 4-4-4-12. the benchmark difference is slight at best (less than 5%). so, your corsair/transcend should be fine at ddr2/667. don't know what your budget is, but hexus.net gave your tuner a so-so review. but at the $50 price point, i 'spose that's expected.
ok i've got another thread going, but maybe you've had experience with both. is ddr2 running at 533mhz with 4-4-4-12 timings any faster than ddr at 400mhz with 2.5-3-3-7? i've built a few systems, but i've never really messed with the timings. i'll soon have my hands on a gig of both types and i want to get another gig to match. i've read a bunch of conflicting articles, but most seem to think that unless you get ddr2 with really good timings, ddr is still the way to go. good timings + ddr2 = $$$
thank you all for helping me out! also please explain to me :- what's the amd's equivalent( same or greater speed) of intel type 640 3.2 mhz 2 mb l2 cache processor???? also are amd's fans noisy????and how many fans do i need to install in such a system(which is comparable to 3.2 mhz p4 system)??? also are amd cpu's reliable?? will they last for say 5 yrs without any problems????? and finally tell me which tuner card is better:- pinnacle pctv pro or compro videomate tv gold plus 2 ?
the amd equivalent would be the athlon 64 3200+, which costs about $160. amds are as reliable as intels, and they produce less heat. i would get an athlon 64 3700+ san diego core for about $210 on newegg. get a name-brand socket 939 board, and some nice ddr400 (amd doesn't support ddr2), and you're good to go. about the tv tuners: i have no idea. i had one in my pc, and i never used it. when i want to watch tv, i watch it on a tv :p.
