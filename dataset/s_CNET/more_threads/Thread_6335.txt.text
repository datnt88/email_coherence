seems that each time i need to buy a piece of computer hardware it has changed so much that what i have is no longer available. i being not a computer knowledgeable person i am looking for a cd/dvd drive that can read/write to both.seems that because blue ray is the dvd format that all others are just about off the market. so i am looking for something that works like a (sony) nec nd3540a which is a 16x8x16x or something that had similar reviews as this did when it was available. as my original cd drive no longer will open and seems to be done so i thought i would upgrade but not being up on much with computers and have use the nec drive in the past i am looking for a cd/dvd drive if you can suggest a decent one with good reviews and is i guess plug & play easy to intstall and work, an internal drive that fits an atx case would be good to know and hoping it is decently priced. i got the nec one for 40.00 from tigerdirect a few years back but now they don't offer any sony/nec drives not surewhy so what brand is a good one or what ones to stay away from? i plan on using it to burn dvd's via a dazzle video capture system with their instant dvd recorder software to convert some old vhs tapes over before my vcr crashes. any information on where i can get one, the brand and model or a link would be nice. thanks, newaygo1
reviews at newegg.com. works for me. good luck vapcmd
then you are probably looking for an ide drive. being you do not keep up on technology, i thought i would just advise on that. allot of new drives are sata. most any drive that newegg features should work for your expectations as they are very similar.
