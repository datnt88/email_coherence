a problem that many students have including me .. you can pay almost the same price to get : imac with good specs like core 2 duo ,1 gb ram ,128 mb vga ,20 &quot;monitor ,etc. or macbook with good specs but a 64 vga and small 13&quot; screen. i know that they are in different categories .. but i live in egypt and i'm going to canada after a month .. and i don't know how will a laptop help my studying in the canadian high schools . anyway ..there is no right or wrong about this thing .. all i want is to know some opinions from people who knows about it . thanks alot ..
next... you might ask that question of your fellow students for a response that better reflects the opinions of someone your own age.
my wife has a macbook and i have an imac. the macbook is nice and portable, but i do a lot of multi-media stuff: movie editing, music, graphics work, etc. i find working with an imac is much easier for doing this stuff. the macbook, with a small screen and scrunched keyboard is too small. also, the imac has more firewire, usb, audio-in, audio-out, speaker plug, etc. that makes it much easier to plug external equipment in and also run my imac speakers, all in a neat package. but, the macbook is portable, and i can download movies and music and take it with me. i just like the space and the &quot;open&quot; work environment that the imac gives me.
well , i guess you're right and for the first time i found someone who though like me , actually i'm a composer and i work with softwares that require a big monitor and also rams . thanx for your opinion
if you're planning on going to college after high school, i'd say go for the macbook because its great to have the portability so you can take it to lectures, use wifi and everything else.
