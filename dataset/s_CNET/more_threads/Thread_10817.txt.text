whats is the recommended app for remote desktop? i tried using pocketcloud free edition but the desktop redraw is kinda slow and no sound. also the pro ver is too expensive i mainly use it view desktop, no gaming, so i guess i want about 5 fps-is it to much? anyone tried airplay? i am using window 7 64 bit and 400 kilobytes/s broadband, if possible i want to use the local wifi wireless router to collect-meaning dont use bandwidth since 400kb/s is kinda slow for high fps i guess.
i can only guess this is your first encounter with that technology but not one remote desktop i've seen comes close to what you get on the real machine. in fact, the reason for such access is pretty simple. to get at the desktop for the things you can't do on the other machine. for me i use it to grab a file i forgot and when done i'm back to my machine. if you see over 1 fps, that's pretty normal. bob
i like and use splashtop. i have android, but it's also available for mac. they do have a separate app for ipad. they have an app for just about every os, even the hp touchpad. i can't quite remember since i got it last year, so not sure if it's free or not. i think the best might be teamviewer. i also have this installed - i installed this one so that i can remote into my family member's pc when they have problems. i can look around their system and fix things. i believe you can even reboot the pc remotely. i tested it out already and it loaded very quickly and using it very impressive. moving around is very fast. i am guessing you could probably remote into your own pc, but i haven't tried this yet. it's one of the best apps for remote pc help. it is also free for private use. if you are a business, then you have to pay for it. i know it works for mac and i believe they have a dedicated ipad app as well.
i really dont remember, but there is an inbuilt remot app on your mac...
