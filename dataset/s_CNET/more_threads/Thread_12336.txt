(yay). now, what can i do with this? currently i'm thinking a few options: 1) make it a bootable drive for emergency rescue operations. but, which os / distro? is there an os that can fit within 64mb? 2) install windows portable apps on it. thinking of abiword for sure, what other useful apps you think can fit on it?
