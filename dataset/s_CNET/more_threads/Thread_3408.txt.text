i bought a lg dvdwriter on ebay. i cannot get this thing to show up on my system at all. my motherboard is all sata devices so i bought a ide to sata connection and nothing. so i bought a pci card that has the ide connections on it. nothing again. i thought it might be that i needed the drivers but i can't find them anywhere. lg's website has nothign on it except for tech specs.
how was the drive jumpered ? what does the resller say ??? vapcmd
it is set as a master since it is the only ide controlled item. i'm using winxp 64bit ed. the seller will not let me return it. as far as drivers, i can't find any at all for this burner. even on lg's website.
not only must you find motherboard sata drivers but booting from a sata cd/dvd only adds more misery. i'm surprised that anyone would do this. bob ps. this issue is not what it appears to be.
