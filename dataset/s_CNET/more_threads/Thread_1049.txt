(more)	you need to know that at the office and home we had issues with windows xp sp1 and usb connected hard disks. we could not run chkdsk on said drives. after sp2 (for xp) was applied we could. microsoft's documentation on sp2 didn't say much about this. but it's an issue worth noting. as to what os, the link writes: &quot;os:windows server* 2003, windows server* 2003 enterprise x64 edition, windows server* 2003 standard edition, windows server* 2003 standard x64 edition, windows* 2000, windows* xp home edition, windows* xp media center edition, windows* xp professional , windows* xp professional x64 edition&quot; so this appears to be for the os in question. i see another possible issue. i'm unsure if said usb ports are usb 2.0. it's fairly well known that some usb drives are marked as usb 1.1 and usb 2.0 but fail on usb 1.1 connections. this confused some but i take it as an error on the package. bob
