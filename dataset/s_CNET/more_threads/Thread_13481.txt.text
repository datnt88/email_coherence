hi, i want to upgrade memory in a gateway 827gm. it has one 512 mb pc3200 ddr-sdram stick in it. i want to add one more stick to it. on newegg there is a wide variety of memory. is there much of a difference in memory and is there a certain manufacturer that i should be looking for? thanks............ tom
system, unless it is a big time gaming system or you are an overfclocker. i have two computers built using the kingmax that they had at a good price and a rebate. works fine.
like ray indicates, you should not have any problems, provided you get right specs for what is recommended for your pc. i purchased crucial and kingston ram from circuit city and best buy, also some mail order with crucial without any problems on my computers, and for installation on others.
