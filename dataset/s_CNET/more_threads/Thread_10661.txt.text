gives you the mechanical dimensions of this supply. it looks very much like any atx psu but armed with this you can use a ruler to see if it fits. bob
with one that's no larger. vapcmd
standard atx psu should fit. you are replacing a 300 with a 300? do yourself a favor and got to at least a 500watt unit, antec or similar.
