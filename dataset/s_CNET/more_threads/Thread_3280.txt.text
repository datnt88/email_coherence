i have been trying to shop for a new, high quality, flatscreen monitor. the dell ultrasharp u2711 has very good stats, features and reviews, but it is more than 2 years old, and i find very little info on anything to replace it. is there anything out there in the same general price range, with equal or better qualities and features? i know it is supposed to run &quot;hot&quot;, but other than that (and the fact that it is a two-year-old design)....would it be a poor choice for a new purchase? thanks, jp
if i were to take bets it will be that next wave of &quot;retina&quot; displays. are you sure you want such a display? bob
well, i have been using an ancient, huge, viewsonic crt, which i have always liked, but which is beginning to show it's age. i like big, and i want good...trouble is, i haven't shopped in so long, i have lost the &quot;thread&quot; on what to look for. i would say 80% of my useage is managing images, and text documents, some photoshop work, and the rest in online games like wow, swtor, and second life. i want to see it, and i am not getting any younger . i can afford $500 to $700. does any of that help? thanks, jp
since you are doing photoshop you probably already have the usual pantone huey thing so why not go shopping as well? that is, head out to fry's, bb and such for a little face time? bob
are disproportionately priced, it might be worthwhile to consider dual displays ...like two 23&quot; or 24&quot; equivalents. i see great offers for monitors including dells on techbargains.com ....look right at the top of the webpage under 'top deals by product category'. you'd probably spend the around the same amount but you'd have two displays ...more screen space and options if that would be any benefit to you. let us know. vapcmd
