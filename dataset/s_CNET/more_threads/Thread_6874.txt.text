i have an intel duel core &quot;extreme&quot; cpu but when i run video processing programs, avid, pinnacle, or coral, the average cpu usage rate averages just below 50%.is there anything i can do to get that to a higher number thus cutting the processing time?
but in spite of this you should see your dual core work smoothly compared to a single core. i use virtual dub and it taps both cores just fine. dvd flick did too. bob
it prolly uses 1 core or offloads the work to the gpu
