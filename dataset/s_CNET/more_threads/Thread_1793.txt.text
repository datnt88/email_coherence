i have a hp media center pc a1357c and i want to play some games like source. but my internal graphics card(built in) only goes up to 64mb as far as i can tell... is there anything i can do to get better graphics without spending money... kinda strapped for cash
if this is your computer,  ...then the specifications say that you have an open slot for inserting a pci express x16 (not agp, not pci) video card. a good video card that has dedicated memory will not share slower system memory. shared memory includes ''integrated video,'' and video carda that have ''hypermemory'' or ''turbocache.'' you can find pci express x16 video cards with dedicated memory for under $100 in the usa. you may need a psu upgrade to accommodate the more power hungry video cards.
im looking at the nvidia geforce 6800 online at newegg for 100.... good deal?
