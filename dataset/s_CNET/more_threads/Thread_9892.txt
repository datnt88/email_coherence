5306	2	270800	2623846	2623621	steven haninger	11/6/07 5:15 pm	1.1943693e12	several possibilites	1. bios not set to autodetect drives 2. sata drive on raid configured port (move to another port) 3. pata drive not jumpered correctly 4. defective drive or cable the first place to look is in the bios setup menu. boot there see what drives show up. it sounds as if the cd/dvd rom is detected. the hd listing should be in that general area. as well, make sure the hd spins up. you should be able to hear the motor start and the clicking from the heads initializing.
