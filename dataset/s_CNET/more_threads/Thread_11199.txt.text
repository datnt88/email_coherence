ok, so i have a dell latitude d505 laptop that i received for free. i came with a fujitsu 60g ata-100 hard drive which i quickly filled up to capacity. i purchased a new western digital 160g drive from newegg which is ata-6. i used a hard drive clone device to copy my smaller drive and then pulled out the old caddy and replaced the drive. upon start-up, i received an error message that the new drive was no bootable. is this due to the difference between ata-6 and ata-100? thats the only discernable difference. the new drive has ~40 pins and the old drive has like a bar type connection. if that is the case, is there anything i can do to use the ata-6 drive or am i screwed?
hey, i figured it out. no need to respond.
of helping others ? vapcmd
