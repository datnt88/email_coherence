(c) dilbert 2008	well, i've completely taken it to bits, and all my boards are very different to this one i suppose i can just check for obvious dry joints on what i assume to be the inverter board! but, although its vaguely the same shape, and the same yellowish colour, it hasnt got those coils and things.
