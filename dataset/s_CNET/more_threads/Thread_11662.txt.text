i am planning to buy this netgear router netgear n600 wireless dual band router wndr3400 the description of this route says i can get a combined thruput of 300 + 300 because it is a dual band now my laptop has got an intel centrino advanced-n 6200 wi-fi adapter.  the description of adapter says it works in dual band and will give me 300 max throughput. question: can i configure this adapter in laptop to work in dual band and get 300+300 max throughput ?
i have yet to find anyone achieve this since all the adapters or on 2.4 or the other band. not both at the same time. bob
in my laptop, i can see there is an option to set my intel wireless adapter to either 2.4 or 5 or multi-band if i were to change to multi band and use this router, shudnt i get 300 + 300 ?
but why not try and convince yourself? kees
i've seen such seek one or the other but i fear you think it will do both at the same time. a short course in the design would be needed to explain why, beyond the simple answers. bob
it doesn't really matter because you won't even get the 300 in the first place. besides the fact that no home user has 300m internet wireless technology is half duplex. so to your question, there is no standard defined for the bonding of 2.4 and 5 channels into a single stream. this means if this ability even existed it would a be a proprietary thing which would mean both your nic and your router would have to come from the same vendor. if you want to write your own drivers and firmware it is technically possible i suppose. you could in theory also get 2 completely separate lan connections up if your pc nic allows this, the router more than likely does. but now you have the larger issue of how to use 2 lan connection at the same time. this is the how do i run 2 internet connections question that there is no good answer for.
the radio is on one band or another. not both. at least that's what the spec sheet said.
