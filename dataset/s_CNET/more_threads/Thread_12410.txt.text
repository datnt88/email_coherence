i have a brand new lenovo 3000 c100 laptop with wireless networking hooked up and stuff, but i've been having problems with it. i can connect to the internet for like five minutes at a time, and then the wireless radio just shuts off by itself. any ideas?
will shut down the wireless while running on batteries if there is no activity.
right click my computer, click properties, click the hardware tab, click device manager. find your wireless card (it'll probably be under network connections). right click it, go to properties. go to the advanced tab (i'm pretty sure...the one with all the options) and enable cam (constantly awake mode).
