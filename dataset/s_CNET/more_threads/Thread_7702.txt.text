i am looking for information on what i need to do. i have a system running win98se, added a hard drive with winme on it. what i would like to be able to do is boot from the second hard drive running winme which i believe is set as a slave. any will would be nice. thanks
windows doesn't like being moved around like that. save yourself a lot of time and kiss what may be worst windows version ever goodbye. i'm not the only one that thinks that. see  you'll see windows me repeated far too often. for another winner, look what people wrote about &quot;microsoft bob&quot;. bob (no relationship to above product.)
well maybe if i tell you why i want to do this it might help. win98 drive has problems and i do not have any of the software because i bought it second had. winme ran fine and i have all of the software from when i purchased it. the winme does not have any burners but the win98 does. so i thought if i took the winme drive and put it in the tower of the win98 i could boot from the winme and use the win98 as extra storage. but i do not kown how to get it to boot from the d (winme) instead of the c (win98). i think you might undersand now why i am trying to do this.
move it to the primary and it will boot. have the windows me cd handy so it can fix itself. bob
will i need to change the plasic piece that makes them a master and a slave? once this is done should i remove the os from the win98 so it can be used for storage only? thanks
the master and slave position is dictated by where we plug in the drive. very old (10 years?) we configured hard disks on 40 conductor cables with the jumpers. follow the method for what hardware you have. bob
i have windows 98 se, i happen to love it. my second tower is windows me, i want to use me for storage. i don't know how to go about connecting the two towers or how to make one primary and other secondary or how to change the slave pins. if anyone could take the time to explain i would so much appreciate it. than you
