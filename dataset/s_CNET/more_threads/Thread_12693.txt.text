i have windows xp with ie6 sp2 installed. every once in awhile, while trying to access abc.com, while the site page is still loading, for some reason, it completely shuts down my ie page. after a few attempts, the page will load and i am good to go. this morning after 10 times of this happening, i thought i would try to get an answer in this forum as to why this is happening. this is the only site that does this. i know i know, as the doctor would say, then don't do that anymore lol....i would appreciate any help, thanks, sitnpritee
that web page is pretty video intensive as it usually has two or three animations running at the same time. what are the specs of your computer, cpu, graphics and ram mainly. also do you do any maintenance such as defrag the hdd and use disk cleanup. your computer may have just too many processes running in the background as indicated by the number of icons down by the clock. and lastly do you check for viruses, trojans, surfing junk, malware, pests?
shows you a few old tricks that are still around. bob
i clicked on that link and it said, dont view this page with java script enabled. i think it does have something to do with java though because after i posted, i tried getting into that site with firefox and it disabled my java and i was able to get in. i still can not get in with ie thank you, sitnpriee
cpu 2.66ghz ram 256 mb. i downloaded that aft and it cleans everything out, ie, temps, cache, cookies,prefetch, etc. , and i use it daily. i defrag and scan disk weekly. i have no icons down by my clock except my zone alarm and my volume icon. i disabled all those things from my startup, so i wouldnt have all those icons down there. since my first post, i tried getting to that site with firefox and i had no problem. it has something to do with ie i think, but i don't know what. thanks again, sitnpritee
