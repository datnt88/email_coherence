hallo, i have another question. i have just put together a pc with an amd 2800+athlon processor, an abit nf7-s2 motherboard, a geforce mx 4000 display card,512 mb crucial pc 3200 ram. when i switch on the power, the cpu and case fans start up, the led lights come on but the computer doesn't boot. the monitor shows a &quot;no signal&quot; message. i have cleared the cmos several times, taken out the battery and replaced it after about twenty minutes and i have insulated the motherboard from the case so i know it's not grounding. does anyone have any ideas. thanks, bert
if so, have you disabled it in the bios??? and, of course, the mobo uses both the 4 pin and 20 [or 24 ] pin power connector and they are both connected.
thanks for your reply, ray. no, the motherboard doesn't have on board video and the 4 pin and 20 pin connectors from the power supply are plugged into the motherboard.thanks, bert
here is a link with good info about pc consturction it may help to review what you have done. a mb is suppose to be grounded to that case, but only where the standoffs for the mounting screws go. try a min post. mb,psu, 1 stick of memory, cpu/heatsink/fan,video card,keyboard and speaker. john
