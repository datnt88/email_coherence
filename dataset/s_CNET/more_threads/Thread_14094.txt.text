i have been stuck at a blue screen on my 2004 dell inspiron 600m for quite some time.. the exact error message is: stop: 0x0000000a(0xff1711f2, 0x0000000z, 0x00000000, 0x804d9b64) i took the computer to best buy geek squad and it works fine there but when i come home this blue screen appears..can anyone help me?
such as what happens when you disable the wifi...
had the same problem. in one environment it is o.k., in another it crashes. if wireless radio is turned off, it is o.k. did you find a solution using the built-in wireless?
i know an issue and have fixed dozens of them. i refuse to enter into yet another discussion about fixing the internal wifi card or if it's a driver. please forgive me as that discussion has been done too many times. here's the card i'm using to overcome this issue -&gt; wpnt511 or wpc54g. you can read all the banter about this at  again, sorry if i don't want to go over this again. it's become a well known issue. i hope you see what's up and understand why i'm just popping in 20 buck cards now. bob
