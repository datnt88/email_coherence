hey all, i'm thinking of purchasing the motorola xoom but i am a bit tentative so i need advice. the last motorola device i owned was the motorola dext/cliq. motorola just ignored this phone and left it with bugs and on like android 0.0.0.1 will they keep a decent support for the motorola xoom? especially as the xoom 2 must be coming soon... also, i'm mainly going to be using it for browsing the internet and maybe doing some college work, will it be good at both those things? are there better alternatives in the same price range? thanks for taking the time to read this
&quot;college work&quot; was the clincher. for now, today, this is not the machine you are looking for.
there's been some talk on here about motorola xoom and i thought i'd give it a review after getting my motorola xoom. i've been a member for 2 days now and so far its been really good. i've been able to download all the harry potter books, the entire twilight series, some david balducci books, and even the comic book of that new movie 'kick-ass the only downfall i saw is when you turn up the volume the sound get distorted because the speakers cannot handle very high volume i seem them on sale on amazon
