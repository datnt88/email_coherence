hi, i have a di-624 router. my comp can connect to the wireless router but cannot connect to the internet which i've connected to the router through a modem. i've gone through all the steps in the guide and also tried updating the firmware but it still doesnt work. can anyone help me on this asap. thanx, rahul.
rahul get into your router and check to see if you had set a filter (ip or mac), as you may of locked yourself out. you could of mis-typed one of the characters. also, check your ethernet cable is plugged in correctly, phone line (dsl) is plugged in, or cable is securely attached. hope this helps.
reach the internet when connected directly to the modem? some with dsl have to add the proper user name and password as well as choosing pppoe as the internet type, in the routers setup page.
what type of modem do you haveand who is your isp?
thanx for your concern. i really appriciate it. i woked the solution out. everything was fine. this time i reseted the router and updated the firmware and cloned the mac address of router and now the net over router is woking just fine. i didnt even had to run the wizard or do any other settings.
