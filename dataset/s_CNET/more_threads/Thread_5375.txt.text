earlier while i was looking at my motherborde i saw a chip it said. ati xp1 400 deos this mean my computer may have a slot for pci-e cards?!
it all depends on your motherboard model. if it has pci express slots, then yes. what is your computer model? what is your motherboard model? download and run cpu-z (cpuid.com) if you need help in determining motherboard (system board) manufacturer and model number. you want a pci express x16 slot for a video card. agp slot is next best. pci is better than no video card. note: &quot;pci express x16&quot; is not the same as &quot;pci&quot;
you can take a picture of your motherboard and post it for us. zoom in on any longer looking input slots above the pci slots (the long white things located near the bottom left of your mother board.)
i found out what my chip set si i did some research and i think it can use pci-express.ati radeon xpress 200 (pci-express)
manufacturer:micro-star model:ms-7145 chipset-ati xpress 200 (rs480) southbridge:ati sb400
your motherboard has an ati xpress 200 chipset, which means there is onboard video. from what the msi website says, there is a pci express x16 slot available for a video card. here is the ms-7145-020 motherboard:  open your case to confirm that you have that long white expansion slot as indicated in the picture. that's where the pci express x16 video may be inserted. note: if you get a powerful video card, you will need to have a good power supply unit (psu).
