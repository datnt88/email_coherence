had to use disk recover on main drive due to problems, saved most my data on drive d (slave) got pc up and running attached both drives and pc would only boot from slave and when it did boot, it booted with no screen, tried ctr alt del and it said no programs running. so now i can only use 1 drive and cant get any of my programs, could anyone still awake please help
little more info. what o/s? how do you know it booted without a screen? do you mean it went through post and then lost the screen going into the operating system? which drive is now slave and which is primary - is there a conflict there? if the boot you are going through is because you copied the o/s, including boot sector to your secondary there very well could be.
you may need to install an os for all this to work again. in closing, it may help if you revealed more about what the problems were. for instance, a disturbing trend is that more people are posting they don't have antivirus software installed. in short, what do you think will happen? bob
