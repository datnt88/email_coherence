just installed a new 500gb drive in addition to the old 500. how do i make each drive accessible/visible/usable to only one user/profile each. in essence, assign each drive to a particular user with complete privacy. note: using vista
the pc stands for personal computer so no. windows doesn't offer this feature.
anyway, is there some workaround or series of file sharing and security augments to get close to the desired effect? if win is too limited, what about third-party programs?
backup is important since such lock programs have left some locked out and they lose their data. look up folder lock for an example.
