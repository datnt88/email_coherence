i have two computers in my office. comp 1. intel p4, 2.4 gh 80 gb hd, 256 mb ddr, win xp professional. comp 2. 152 speed, win98, 128 mb ram, 20gb hd. is it possible to network the computers. any guidance/suggestion is appreciated.do i need win proxy to make it work? guru
is the quickest and easiest. plug'em in, turn on file and printer sharing, done. and you can surf from them both. get a wireless router and a wired or wireless nic for each pc and it'll save you from having to run wiring.
yes, it's possible. use ad-hoc method
i am not sure what is ad-hoc method. coulds you please shed some light on the method. thanks guru
two computers with wireless cards operating in ad-hoc mode can talk directly to each other. most people deploy in &quot;inrastructure&quot; mode. all traffic passes through the ap. even trafic that goes wireless to wireless goes to the ap first. skrall
