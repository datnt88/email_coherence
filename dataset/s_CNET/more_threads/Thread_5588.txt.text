im having a problem with my video card . its an ati 3d rage 2+dvd.. with 20mb of memory.. well when i plug it in and i boot up the computer it freezes when the windows loading screen is up(black with windows logo).. it freezes after about 8 seconds.. and i have to shut off the computer..when i take out the card and plug the monitor into the integrated video card the computer runs fine.. any suggestions??
you have to disable your integrated graphics first. then you can install the card. good luck:)
...your motherboard has an agp slot?
then the onboard graphics chip is probably better than that card, unless the motherboard is really old. what is your motherboard and why are you trying to install this card? by using the info you provided for the video card, it is not much of a video card by today's standards. also sounds like the card may be faulty.
