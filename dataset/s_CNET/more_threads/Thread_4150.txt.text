depends on your vendor or maker, see if there is a *back-up* procedure that will make restore or recovery cds. read the manual or visit thier support website for such instructions and usually this is a one time shot. otherwise, contact the maker now and stress the need for restore/recovery disks. this may involve a small cost or none, exclduing s/h fee if recent purchase. fyi - don't type in capitals, it expresses *loud talking/shouting* or emphessis in computer lingo. tada -----willy
if not (no make/model) you'll look up acronis. bob
