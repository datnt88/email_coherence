please help. after struggling with an range expander that didnt work. i unplug it and reset the thing to toss. the trouble is now i have 2 ssid with same name but one is secured and the other is not. i tried to upgrade the old router with a new one, and the unsecured ssid still lingers on, besides having weaker signals. now i cant connect to the new router. when i tried go back to the old router and created a new ssid with different channel... why is the old ssid (non-secured one) still shows up on my list of network?? and the new ssid keep disappearing and i couldn't log on to it? old router wrt54gs (using it ) new router wrt300n (ready to return to store) range expander wre54g please help
press the reset button in the back of the wireless router for 30 seconds, then power it on. setup should be wall &gt; isp modem/router &gt; wireless router &gt; wired/wireless update the firmware in the wireless router. broadcast ssid(change this to make connecting easier) use wpa security. use channels 1, 6 or 11. most devices work better on these channels mixed b and g mode(n is it applies) save changes and exit. power down everything. turn on the isp modem/router wait 30 seconds turn on the wireless router. wait 30 seconds. now turn on your computer. try to connect to the new ssid. you could also try the range expander and it should also work. i think it's the combination or the wpa security and the channels. let me know what you got. rick
just wait. i know there is a fix to toss out that display but in 24 hours to a few weeks windows will stop offering that old ssid.
thanks rick, but how do i go about setting up wpa. i have been using wep only. thanks again. tony
