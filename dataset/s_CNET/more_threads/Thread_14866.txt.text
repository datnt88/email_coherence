howdy, the hard drive on my hp pavilion zv5120us failed and i need to get a new one. can i just go and get any 2.5&quot; ide drive or do i need a specific one that hp reccomends? i can't find a whole lot of information on hp's support site, it's so fantastic! thanks for your help. david l.
...the same. same ide / power plug etc., but check your bios and manual first to make sure it has an &quot;auto-detect&quot; hard drive option. if it can &quot;auto-detect&quot;, it'll almost certainly be able to use any laptop drive, as these are standard across all makes and models. seagate's momentus (one with perpendicular storage) would be a good upgrade. these offer better speeds, quicker accesses, lower votage use, and produce less heat than usual (but cost more!). it might inject a bit of extra life into your laptop.  geebee.
does the same apply for apple laptops? i may end up purchasinng a macbook, but if i want to upgrade that hard drive, the same applies correct? any ide drive will work?
...applies to apple laptop hard drive upgrades / replacement. they use the same 2.5&quot; ide hard drive interface. gb.
this url will take you to your specific model number laptop and the drives for it:  if you have questions ( i would &quot;always&quot; contact the vendor first when needing any questions answered before ordering any parts), here's the contact page info:
