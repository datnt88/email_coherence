i need a driver for the ricoh rw5125a to work on a windows 98 (i can give you the specs if need be) any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks
today, no driver is required for it to function as a cd or dvd &quot;drive.&quot; however software to record or play a dvd might be needed. some refer to such as drivers but they are not drivers. bob
i didn't even try the drive as a dvd drive yet, (i didnt try to play a dvd) but i dont have software anyway. my computer labels it as a cd-rom, i'll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works. though somebody gave me this site,  i don't know what to get from it.
subtract that comma at the end and the link will work
that's fine and how i see many working drives. &quot;my computer labels it as a cd-rom, i'll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works. though somebody gave me this site,&quot; i don't see how that applies. if you want to play a dvd, you'll need dvd player software such as windvd, powerdvd. bob
