the title says everything. i have an nvidia asus gtx 460 graphics card that was working fine before. whenever i pop the cd in that came with it, the drivers won't install, and when i download them from the nvidia webpage, i try to install them and it says &quot;unable to detect graphics card.&quot; everything's plugged in, considering i didn't unplug any cables through the reformat session. any ideas?
check the card and how it is fitted in the slot. kees
i find myself installing motherboard drivers before the video card can be found.
