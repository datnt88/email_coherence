so this morning i turn on my computer to find that my third hdd (1tb sata seagate) is not reading. i found out later on that it is for sure the hdd and not the motherboard because i switched satas with my other hdd and the computer was still not recognizing the hdd. i was wondering if anyone out there has any suggestions on how to fix this problem? i was also wondering if it could be changed into a external hdd if thats a possible solution. i'm running on windows vista 64 bit also i was wondering if its not possible to use it as a hdd is it possible to recover the data in there without going to those super expensive data recovery places. any suggestions would be much appreciated.
