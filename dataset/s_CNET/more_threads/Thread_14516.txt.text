ahem! a while back my son-in-law, who is a wonderful fellow but works on a computer from the dark side (pc), was clued into a way to add wireless access to his computer without having an internal card. it was a little thing that looked like a stick, and i believe it was just inserted into a place on the back of the computer. it worked just fine. in some ads for places selling computer supplies, i saw just such a thing (i think), but i (1) don't know whether such a thing exists for macs and (2) whether my computer--sawtooth g4 desktop--is compatible with anything now being sold for that purpose. the computer never had an airport card, and if i wanted one, i'd have to search for an old one (probably 11b). i think i'd need the older versions of other equipment that goes with such an old card, too, so i was wondering whether that would pertain also to the kind of external wireless device i started talking about here. if i could buy something current, and if it was easy to install, what a blessing that would be! forgive my ignorance. i don't even know what the thing is called, and i am aware that what i'm asking for may be totally out of reach, but hope springs eternal. . . . jenny
here's the google to find compatible usb wifi client hardware.  bob
thanks, bob. i read some of the articles from &quot;macosx hints&quot; with a lot of caveats and &quot;buts,&quot; but maybe those problems have been solved now. i also looked at one site offering a variety of dongles. not sure what characterizes the more expensive ones from the modestly priced ones, and i can't say i really understand all the terms, but when i get a chance, i'll read descriptions and try to decipher it all. maybe i'll take the plunge, maybe not. it's something to consider when i have some more time. i do thank you very much, especially, for leading me to what to google. now i can return, at a less pressured time, to read more and make a decision. best, though in haste, jenny
