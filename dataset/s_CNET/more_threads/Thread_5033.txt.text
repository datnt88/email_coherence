hi, i have a 12&quot; g4 powerbook (1.5 ghz powerpc g4, 512 mb ddr sdram) running os 10.3.9, with one of those crap matshita dvd-r uj-835e superdrives that i haven't had the cash to replace (until now). there are two places i'm thinking of using: macservice ( iresq ( both companies install the panasonic 8x dual layer, which i understand is what apple also uses. my questions: 1) is the panasonic as unreliable and prone to breakdown as i understand the matshita to have been? 2) is there a better drive out there? i've heard that pioneer dvr-k05 is more reliable. 3) if you think i should just go with the panasonic, do you have anything positive/negative to say about either of these companies? thanks in advance for your help!
while you may call the uj-835e carp i want to share with you a problem i see in the industry. they didn't do a good job of relaying that all these low prices came at the cost of lower years of life in the products. so i want to warn you that your replacement drive will likely last just as long as your uj-835e. that being said, i try to shop at the usual mac outlets since they'll get me the drive that will &quot;just work.&quot; i know i get to replace these things about every 1 to 3 years depending on a variety of factors. bob
thanks, bob. you're right on. i think i'm going with the pioneer drive.
i hope i've saved you from the rma dance. bob
