11592	9	512696	5061236	5060989	rob10	1/8/11 6:28 pm	1.29451128e12	it's not like a small form factor case...	but it's not as big as a studio xps 9100. i don't need that much hp. i realize i won't be able to go with a monster 3d card, but i don't need to. just one that's big &quot;enough&quot;. (i believe tha precision workstation t1500 doesn't have a bigger case, and it's autocad certified) starting to see i really don't need that powerful of a card.
