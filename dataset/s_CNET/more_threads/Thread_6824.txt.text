issue: samsung ide hdd 250gb is spinning but the needle keeps going to the middle and back, over and over again ( i took it apart to see what could be wrong), but it's not mounting on any pc. i used a double usb &gt; micro usb cable. so it does have sufficient power. (the hdd is normally in a casing, which dropped yesterday and is probably causing the issue) does anyone have ay idea if i can make it work again, and what is causing the issue if anyone is interested, i can upload a movie of the spinning hdd tonight so people can see what i mean. ty in advance,
too many and none of them apply to home repair. this is one you send to:  this is not to sound cruel but the issue is well known, you could research it but if you ask that means you can't recover this hard drive. sorry i can't blunt this any further. if you had the tools and skills you wouldn't be asking. bob
after investigating the hdd i took apart, it seems the hdd reading pins , or whatever they are called, are slightly bent. i'm going to try and get myself a old similar hdd and put the hard disk in that one to see if it can still read my data. and you're right if i had the tools and the skills (got skills but not much on hardware) i wouldn't be asking. but that's what forums are for, right!
be sure you pay little or nothing as that no longer works in modern drives. the reasons are out there on the net. forums are for asking such questions. if someone asks one that shows they are not ready or didn't do the research then you might get a reply like mine. i try to blunt the force or impact but sometimes i fail. if you want your data back i strongly suggest you let drivesavers.com do the work. bob
