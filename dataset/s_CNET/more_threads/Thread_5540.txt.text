i have an emachine with 512mb of ram which is now at 448mb. i need to upgrade to 1gb but i can't find a store that carries this model. the model is a emachine w3507 and runs windows xp home edition. would i need to buy a new modem? i can't download because it tells me my memory is too low. can anyone help me with this?
these appear to use the same motherboard chipset so head to crucial.com and get the w3506 memory sticks. &quot;would i need to buy a new modem?&quot; odd question. why would you need a new modem? bob
maybe your confusing &quot;memory&quot; with storage. hard drive space?  will go into your board.
