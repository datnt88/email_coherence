my operating sysrem is 2000pro. would it be better to use a sofware backup such as acronis or an external hard drive? i am concened that if i use a software backup and the pc crashes the software would be wiped out as well. your asvice and thoughts would be appreciated. hal
then you re install it, install the backup program, insert your restore files/cds/dvds and click restore. thats the purpose of the program. i would use software. imo konny
the other way is to clone your hd then restore after you reinstall the os, eather way works. the most important thing is do the back up. john
