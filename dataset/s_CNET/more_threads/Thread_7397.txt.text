i just bought this camera, easy to install but image quality is horrible. anyone has some tricks in this regard? may be the best trick is to return it.
some compare such to digital cameras which surveillance cameras rarely compete with. bob
standard television is equivilent to 320x240 resolution. this typically looks pretty poor on a full screen monitor. 30 frames per second is considered real time video. most of the video capture cards clame 640x480 resolution and 30 fps but they separate these as 2 different line items. you usually get 640x480 at 15 fps or 320x240 at 30 fps. you can save bandwidth by reducing to 25fps. you should compare these numbers with your camera specs. if it uses a standard lens you may be able to swap that out and improve the picture quality. skrall
more than likely the resoulution of this camera is either 320x240 or 640x480. the 640 may not look that bad but if it is a 320 it would look terrible on a computer screen. i think d-link makes a similar camera that has better specs than the linksys, might be worth checking out. good luck.
