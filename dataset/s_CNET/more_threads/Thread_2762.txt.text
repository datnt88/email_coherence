im getting a core 2 duo but not sure which one. any suggestions i mainly us my pc for gameing
if money is no object then go for the quad cores ones. if money is a factor than see how high you can go within your budget. regards, jb
no matter what chip you get, you should be able to overclock it if you want to. if money is no object, go for a quad core. if it is...well, depends on your price range. e6600 would be a good choice for a midrange budget. if you just want something cheap to overclock like nuts, get an e4300 or e6300.
