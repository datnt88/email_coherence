i currently have two sys. a laptop upstairs and a desktop downstairs that has the printer attached to it.. both have windows xp. the laptop is using a wireless connection. both sys can get to the internet. when i first got these sys i could print from the laptop. about a three weeks ago i loaded the firewall that aol had offered to it's members. for about a week after loading this to the desktop and then the laptop. i could print. however for the last two weeks i could not print from the laptop. i can not see the printer. i have since removed the firewall from both sys. also i can not see the laptop from the desktop nor the desktop from the laptop. no network. have have run the wizard and still no connection. i can still get to the internet. steve
so you can reach internet from the wireless connection but you can't see your wireless network? do you transmit your ssid? are you perhaps connected to the network of your maighbour? good luck, buy

not sure what a ssid is. no it's my internet/connection.
ssid is the identification name that every wireless access point uses to identify itself to clients. on some access points, you can turn its broadcast off so that it doesn't sit there telling anybody/thing within range &quot;here i am, my name is (fill in the blank), connect to me if you want to (and have the right password if that is required).&quot; what we suggesting here is that you have a neighbor who just installed a wireless access point and didn't do a very good job of securing it. your laptop has decided it likes the connection over there better than your own (signal may be stronger?). so you are surfing the 'net on his account without knowing it. your printer isn't on his network, so that's why you can't get to it. look at the connection details when your laptop is on and judge whether you are still on your own network. dw
