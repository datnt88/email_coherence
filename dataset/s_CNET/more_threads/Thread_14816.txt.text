hi, i have 2 linksys wireless routers, a wrt300n and an old befw11s4. i do not get good signal with the wrt300n even when i'm just a couple rooms away. i was wondering if it would be possible to connect the old router to the new one so i would be able to have 2 wireless access points in my house. thanks
we got it covered at about post 18 in this forum's sticky post. yes you can!
thank you so much! i was looking everywhere for an answer.
