i have an e-machine t1440. it has a 1.40ghz intel celeron processor,running windows xp home edition. it came with 128mb sdram. i added a stick of 256mb sdram to it. when i check the computer to see how much memory there is, it still says 128. i was told that it will detect the added ram automatically. i added the ram because i was getting low memory popups. i am still getting them. did the computer not take the new ram? the new stick of ram has been tested good also.
does the ram show in bios? if not try taking out the old stick and swapping slots. or make sure rams inserted correctly
if control panel/system still shows only 128k then the memory is not being recognized. either it is the wrong type, or it is not installed properly. your system should recognize it automatically.
well sometimes people trying to sell ram will send pop-ups to your computer telling you you are low on ram. i have 512mb of ram and still see them. if this is an internet - sent popup, ignore them. --fj
it is windows giving me a low memory warning. i've tryed switching te slots and leaving one out, i still get 128k no matter what i do.
just a guess, but i was once told that not all ram fits in all motherboards. did you consult you mboard website for recommended brands of memory? might be a conflict there. in the interim, try shutting down any mem resident programs you don't need. good luck.
thanks for the help everyone. i tryed booting up with only the 256 in both slots, and it won't boot. so my guess is the ram is bad, or doesn't work with my motherboard. crucial.com says the density might be wrong, and that the motherboard is picky about its ram.
