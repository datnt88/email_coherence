i've been using this drive on my vista machine for a while now, but apparently only to read. i fire up a couple of burning programs and can't get them to see the drive. so i look around, see that maybe i need to use burnrights. nope, it can't see the drive. so i read somewhere that i should flash the firmware. so i download the firmware flasher (binflash and k34503cq from dell). no go, they can't see the drive either. necwinflash also says no supported devices. freakin vista. geez. drive shows up in device manager, but none of these programs can see it. anyone got any advice on how to proceed?
that is running xp or an os that will allow this to get done. however if this is just busted why not make it a warranty issue?
it was previously on a xp machine, worked fine for burning and reading. moved to vista, works fine for reading. just can't get any burn program to recognize it. it's either a vista problem or a firmware problem.
get it updated by a friend. the manufacturers won't be good on this since a new dvdrw is all of 30 or under bucks. good luck,
reboot. vapcmd
just for the heck of it download a free trial of nero to the system and try that, you have nothing to lose unless of course you have a buddy who has a nero or roxio disk you can load. for vista it would have to be a pretty current version of either. but i would give it a shot, especially since it shows in device manager.good luck!
