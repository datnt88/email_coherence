9711	6	598364	5483212	5483189	r. proffitt	8/1/13 4:00 pm	1.3753728e12	it's likely isolated but	it didn't look like a bad choice with it being single rail to avoid you learning about all that. next time, add 100 more watts. more power, arr arr arr! bob
9711	7	598364	5483211	5483183	shavener	8/1/13 4:00 pm	1.3753728e12	that was it.	that was right. so was that an isolated incident with only that psu or will my computer reject every new one i try to install, for instance this
9711	8	598364	5483220	5483212	shavener	8/1/13 4:03 pm	1.37537298e12	sorry, noob here.	sorry, but can you explain to me what single rail means?
9711	9	598364	5483213	5483220	r. proffitt	8/1/13 4:05 pm	1.3753731e12	it's on the web so a short answer.	a single +12v rail means you don't need to check into if one or more rails could be overtaxed by your gpu or other choices. you also don't have to take care for run the one rail to your gpu then the others to drives and such. that's called balancing the rails, well discussed and most folk burst into flames when they find out about this. bob
9711	10	598364	5483221	5483213	shavener	8/1/13 4:13 pm	1.37537358e12	last question i promise.	how can you tell if a psu is single or multi rail? unless it says it somewhere in the product description and i missed it.
9711	11	598364	5483231	5483221	r. proffitt	8/1/13 5:02 pm	1.37537652e12	in the product specs.	look at the output ratings and if it's a single +12v rail you see one ampere rating for the lone +12v. if more you see them tell you the rating for each rail. bob
