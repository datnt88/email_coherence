amd athlon 64 fx-62 dual core or... intel core 2 duo extreme x6800 2.93ghz 4mb cache 1066mhz fsb i just made another topic like this about graphics cards, and i have the same question about these processors. i have always been an intel guy, but i wanted to make sure i wasnt making the wrong decision here. i know that like video game consoles people argue over which is better, but can anyone tell me if they will run about the same or which will be better. i diddnt even think about it until i saw &quot;save 300&quot; on an athlon system at alienware, now i am trying to decide if its worth it... thanks guys i really appreciate it.
the tom's hardware site is probably your best bet. try
