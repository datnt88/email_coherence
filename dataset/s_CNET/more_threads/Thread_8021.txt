10846	3	511100	5052429	5052435	r. proffitt	12/24/10 3:17 pm	1.29320382e12	sorry.	i would be guessing if this is just another pc power supply. i had hope you could tell more. i know, i know that some folk want to replace with the exact models but in your common pcs we have some standards. if you would share a bit more then i could see if a stock supply will do. there are some hundreds on newegg.com that would do but if you would tell more such as the dimensions and connections it would go a long way. bob
