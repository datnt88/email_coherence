hi, i was thinking of buying a good mouse. i would usually use it for portable use with macbook. any mouse is okay, as long as you don't need a power socket. i have big hands so ergonomics counts alot. i also care about the features of the mouse too! my choices so far: microsoft arc mouse microsoft explorer/ explorer mini logitech vx nano you guys are welcome to give more suggestions. i mainly want to see the other people's opinions about these mice and any problems that may have arisen after usage, since i don't want to encounter the problems with a mouse after i buy it. thanks alot
it has one and only one quirk. it sleeps a lot. that is the first millimeter of movement when it's been sitting still might be ignored. it's there but not a killer reason for me to change it out. i'd buy it again. bob
thank you for the advice. i have seen the v450 nano. it would be one of my choices as well. however, i was really looking for a prosumer kind of mouse, like the vx nano (different from v450 nano)
our family now has 3 of the 450 nanos. i'm unsure why i'd get the other one today.
