recently, i have begun looking into digital notepads. however, all of them seem to require paper, which is something i definately don't want. some e-readers like the iliad have got a similar function, but they are expensive, and i don't need the e-reader functions. a pc-tablet is not an option, because i want it to function independantly from my laptop while still being able to see what i'm writing/doodling. any suggestions?
wacom offers the cintiq and adesso offers the cybertablet. i too am searching for a viable paperless option. good luck in your search.
i am looking for like a digital etch n sketch. just something i can use word on and doodle with. thats all. i want to see what im doing with out paper. if anyone knows of any please let me know.
if you're still looking for something i'd recommend checking out the infinity binder ( it's very cheap and works easily with and android/ios smartphone or tablet.
