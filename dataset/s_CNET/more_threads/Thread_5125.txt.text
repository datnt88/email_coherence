i have xp, and i just partitioned my new external western digital hard drive as ntfs. i took my hard drive to school ( we use macs os 10), and the mac would not recognize my drive. the drive is supposed to be multi-platform. how would i partition my drive so that both macs and pcs recognize the drive? thanks!
best of luck. bob
hi! fat 32 was not an option when i partitioned it. thanks again.
anyone know how to get that fat 32 option on a pc (windows xp)? also, if i were to partition my drive on a mac (os 10), what format would i partition it so that both platforms, windows xp and os 10, both recognize my drive? thanks!
when i partition, if i keep the partitions under 32gb, then i can format in fat32 or ntfs. your reply didn't tell much so i am unsure why you couldn't accomplish this feat. bob
