hello, i was hoping someone could help suggest what kind of ram i should be using with a gateway intel core 2 quad processor q6600 (2.4ghz,1066mhzfsb,8mb). the ram i have in it is value ram and it sucks and is super slow still with games and other programs. so if anyone can help me out i would appreciate it. thank you.
what video card is installed and what games? for instance tom's hardware setup an amazing machine with everything and crysis clocked in at a headaching 10 frames per second. bob
i have a nvidia geforce7600gt 256mb ddr2 video card dual dvi/tv . my pc has 2gb of ram at the moment.
that could clock in at single digit frame rates. i hope you can see the words in red when you post since leaving those details out could be leaving clues hidden. bob
here is the specs for the pc. i just dont know what to upgrade on it.ram, video card? 1014105r gateway dx430x 3403778 genuine microsoft windows vista home premium (32-bit) gw cto 1 3403590 microsoft win vista home premium media (32-bit) (us/uk/ca) 1 3403926 mcafee 90-day internet security suite compsub v. 1.2 (vista) 1 3408645r bezel for gershwin with black polish 1 3408392r intel core 2 quad processor q6600 (2.4ghz,1066mhzfsb,8mb) 1 3402563r 2048mb 667mhz ddr2 sdram (2-1024) 1 3408324r systemboard w intel g965 uatx, w/ 1394, 10/100 1 3402621r 500gb 7200rpm serial ata ii/300 hard drive w/ 16mb cache 1 3403708 dwl cyberlink power2go 1 3408644r gateway gershwin 5-bay uatx mcr, 1394 1 3401883r 400w power supply btx non-pfc 1 3408467r nvidia geforce7600gt 256mb ddr2 video card dual dvi/tv 1 3408877r no tv tuner card selected 1 3408368r gateway 104+ elite keyboard (for vista) 1 3403398r soft-touch usb optical wheel mouse (tungsten) 1 3408958r creative sound blaster x-fi xtremegamer pci sound card 1 3400298r gateway 2.0 speakers 1 3403429r unibryce 56k pci data/fax modem 1 3403947 dwl netzero desktop icon only 1 3403859 intel viiv technology driver v. 1.6 (for vista) 1 3403709 america online client application 1 3404091 dwl ms windows vista wau (32-bit) 1 1535429 microsoft works 8.5 1 1533652 c-valuepln 3yr parts/labor/no onsite/techsup-dtmid1yr 1 7010756r gateway 22&quot; widescreen high-definition lcd display - innolux 1 3403392r 48x/32x/48x cd-rw/dvd combo drive (tungsten) 1 3408378r 16x super mfdvdrw/dvd-ram+/-r/cd-r/rw double layer writer
vista. that's dx10 land and while you have a fine card it's not a good match in the world of vista. try dx10 cards from this list -&gt;  i see a good reason for subpar performance now. then again we could chat about the good old (xp) days. bob
