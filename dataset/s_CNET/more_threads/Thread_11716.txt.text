hello, i want to add memory to my p3 computer and my board support sdram memory. i tried to put 2x 512mb pc133 sdram memory, but my bios recognize only 256mb total. i updated to the bios to those details(b1120iag.bin
goto  and check there for definite answers for ram. enter your data and verify against what you have. i suggest you verify you have similar is not paired ram or maker, hi or low density type, and the timing /speed of each. you may have to play with it and also to delve into the bios to increase voltage level as a final tweek if needed. oldeer systems tend to be picky on how the ram was installed. tada -----willy
look at  and as you dive into this issue you discover it's just a limit of the old bx chipset. the best sticks for those old machines were 128mb sticks and fill all the slots. bob
thank you all for a fast answer, i'm looking for the solution.
sorry, was i unclear here? let me try blunt. the memory sticks are incompatible but will register as 128mb sticks and may function as such fine. trying blunt again. the chip and board design doesn't support this memory size. is that clearer? bob
