we are planing on buying a new computer capable of converting video tapes to dvds. we like the looks of sony rs530g but can't find much infomation on how good sony is on reliabliability and service. how does this computer compare to hp and dell computers? in checking in comsumer reports we found very little information about sony. have always thought sony was the top of the line in their products and just wondered why we weren't seeing the infomation about their computers. your help in this infomation would be greatly appreciated. n. chastain p s we are almost 70 yrs old and techknowlegy challenged. (like steers we still try)
while i'm still smarting over a dozen laptops from sony at the office, their dvd creation software is very nice. hp and dell don't offer this ease of creating a dvd. not a bad choice. bob
go with a company called bunnie computers. i have their hare performance pro, and i am in to the same thing converting to dvd. bunnie computers has the new pentium 4 prescott that neither dell, ibm, or sony has yet to offer. this difference is; dell (512kb l2 cache) bunnie (1mb) l2 cache. you do the math :o) plus it glows
