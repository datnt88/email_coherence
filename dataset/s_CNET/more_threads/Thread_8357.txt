7115	0	29180	331734	nr	jferrant	7/13/04 7:47 pm	1.08974802e12	hp laserjet 1100	recently i tried to print a document for may daughter on my laser. the document was left and right justified. when i printed it, the output was left justified for the most part. i found a copuple of spots where it tried to justify the text but it never made it. in some cases it put a big gap inside a word. ever see the word ice spelled i (big gap) ce. really strange. it appears i have the latest driver but i downloaded it again and had the system install on top of itself. no soap, output still bad. tried the hp support forum but no one wanted to respond. hoping i have better luck here. btw, i am running w98se and using office 2000 (word to be exact). i tried printing the same file on my daughters system and it looked just fine. she is running winme, office 2000 and is printing to an epson 740i. anybody have any ideas where to go from here? john
