if you're planning on building your own or upgrading your system, amd has confirmed huge price cuts for july 24. you'll be able to take advantage of these prices the same day since athlon64s (and amd2 mobos) are already in the channel. intel core 2 duos (conroes) will be similarly priced but probably won't be readily available until the first or second week of august. athlon64 x2-5000+ $282 (now $649) athlon64 x2-4600+ $224 (now $522) athlon64 x2-4200+ $175 (now $339) athlon64 x2-3800+ $149 (now $277) athlon64 3800+ $102 (now $246) athlon64 3500+ $79 (now $130)
wonder about the x2 4400, 4800 and the opterons ? vapcmd
those parts will probably wind up being the same price as the 5000+/4600+ and effectively discontinued. the pricing is too low to support 6 different cpus spaced $15-$20 apart.
i knew that prices were going to be dropping, but i didn't know i'd be able to get a 5000+ cheaper than the 4200+ i bought!!! now i wish i had waited another month!!! --chedrz
the 5k looks interesting but i didn't really need it. guess i'm lucky this time. got the whole system ready to with a x2-3k and 2gb ram. the 5k will make a nice addition ...and the the 3k will make a good hand me down or maybe a good backup system cpu. vapcmd
how will these price drops work in retailer stores? your saying the drop will happen immediately? does that mean on the day? the announced amd price drop will happen on monday, july 24th. when will retailers such as fry's and compusa drop their prices to match the dropped prices? on the same day? after a week? a month? a year?
techbargains.com, anandtech.com, tomshardware.com, newegg.com, zipzoomfly.com, etc., as soon as they're posted. no one here knows such info unless they work for one of the retailers .. and telling potential buyers like you or me would not be in their best interest. vapcmd
