hey guys, i need help deciding on a new video card for my computer. i have a p4 2.8 gh, 1 gb ram, and a fx 5700 le 128mb video card. i might need to upgrade my power supply to accomidate the new card. i do not know the wattage rating of it. i have a agp slot. my current choices are: a diablotek geforce 6600 le/256mb ddr for $95 from tiger direct, a diamond radeon x1300 / 512mb ddr2 for $130 also from tiger direct, and these newegg cards: an apollo 6800 geforce 6800 128mb 256-bit ddr for $130, an asus 512mb geforce 6800 128-bit gddr2 for $180, a bfg tech geforce 6800gs 256mb 256-bit gddr3 for $200, a diamond radeon x1300 512mb 128-bit gddr2 for $114, a evga geforce 6600 256mb 128-bit ddr for $100, evga geforce 7800gs co 256mb 256-bit gddr3 for $270, and a pny geforce 6600 256mb 128-bit ddr for $112. i would prefer to stay below $200, around $150ish. i want to be able to play oblivion at decent settings on a 17&quot; moniter, and some other games like it. any other video cards that i have not listed here that you recomend would be fine as well. thanks!
if i had the funds to upgrade my (motherboard, cpu, memory, vidoe card pci xpress) i would have but i plan to do that the end off the year. i got the bfg 256 6800 gt agp in january, which replaced the xfx 256 5700 le. a week or two latter the 7800 agp cards came out. i am not planning to upgrade the video card any more. as far as my mobo is concerned it is maxed with the bigest socket a cpu amd xp 3200 you can put in it & 2 gigs of pc3200 memory duel channel. power supply thermaltake 680. get a bigger power supply. i would say get one of the 7800 agp cards. the specs on them are realy nice. (that is just my opion) good luck: wendell h
7800gs is a ripoff because agp is dead.
i do not know much about ati, so can you clear something up? what is the difference between the ati cards: the x 800, the x 1300, and the x 1600? hope you can help me with this. thanks!
watch out for tigerdirect.com rebates. you will not get you money.
i know that most people with newer computers have the ability to use the pci-e cards, but for those of us with older, can't afford either new computer or new mobo/chip and have the agp slot, there is still a market. it may be smaller, but it exists. my older althon xp 1800+ uses agp. do i want to upgrade my mobo, etc.? you bet. can i afford to upgrade? no way, not this year at least. i recently bought from newegg an evga fx5500 256mb 128-bit agp card for under $50. notwithstanding that i am having weird problems with errors and freezes (could be the driver?), i'm getting a beautiful clear screen for general use.
i have the same fx5500 video card, and i like it. (i'm not a gamer.) in general, it's not that one shouln't get an agp card for an older system. it's that investing so much (about $300 for the 7800gs) on an agp video card is not advisable. if you get a new system, which gamers tend to do more frequently than gereral purpose users, then you can't transfer your $300 investment to the new computer's pci-express x16 slot. imo, a big waste of money.
i understand your point about upgrading agp is a waste of money. my system has been glitching a lot, and i am thinking of getting a new one. that way, i won't have to waste that money that would go toword a new system. thanks for the advice!
...you can get a new pcie motherboard and a pretty decent pcie card.
