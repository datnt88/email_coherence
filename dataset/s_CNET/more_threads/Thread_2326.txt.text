i just had verizon come in and set up my wireless network at home. i'm running two laptops on it and would like to run my printer through the router. the printer is hooked up and the router recognizes that something is plugged into the ethernet port, but the ping test always fails. i've tried adding the printer as a standard tc/ip setting, but the computer can't find the printer (i suppose because it's not communicating with the router properly). printer: hp laserjet 2840 laptop: windows vista any help would be appreciated. networking this printer would be a great help. thank you
have you set your printer's ip to be in the same range as your network ips? does the printer's subnet mask match your network's mask? usually these are set from the printer's front panel, but you'll need to refer to the manual for actual adjustment.
thanks, sunwatcher, i set the printer's ip & subnet mask to the one's assigned by the router, but still can't get the printer to ping. response.
have you been able to setup your hp 2840 after you got the ip address issue? i have similar problem. i have setup hp2840 printer with ip address and subnet mask as per my router configuration but i can't ping it. i am using xp.
