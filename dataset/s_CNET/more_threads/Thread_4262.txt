7987	3	284307	2708098	2707260	pezonator	2/18/08 8:08 pm	1.20336528e12	i'll try it	thanks for the reply i didn't think about re-seating the ram and video card, i will try this and let you know what happens. the cpu is in properly and matches the m/b, so that's fine. i also have 2gb of geil ddr400 ram (4x512mb), i've had these for over a year now and seem to work fine. the psu is a thermaltake 750watt and is brand new. i'm beginning to think that the video card may be faulty.... i hope that's not the case.

7987	5	284307	2708200	2708118	pezonator	2/19/08 1:08 am	1.20338328e12	the thing is...	i've been thinking it can't be a problem with the memory or gpu because i can play games, listen to music and watch videos for hours without any problems.?/?-.- thanks though, i'll do a memory test soon.

7987	7	284307	2709151	2708216	pezonator	2/19/08 11:57 pm	1.20346542e12	oiling eh?	never thought of that, so thanks. the temp is running pretty good, cpu is at 40 to 45 degrees and mobo at 23-27 degrees. the case is an antec 900 which helps alot. i also changed the resolution colour to 16 bit, down from 32bit and it seems to be working fine, no crashes and i've been all over the web. so it might be fixed although it now looks pretty average, there might be some colour distortion. i'm not game enough to go back to 32bit thanks guys

7987	12	284307	2715895	2714864	pezonator	2/27/08 2:23 am	1.20407898e12	dx diag	i have run dx diagnostics and it comes up with no problems. i did change my agp setting to 4x instead of 8x and it seems to be working ok. i have been on sites that have made it crash without trouble such as youtube. i think i'll just have to change to 4x mode when i'm surfing the net for a while and go back to 8x when playing games. thanks for the help. if changing to 4x does not fix it, then i'll post here again
