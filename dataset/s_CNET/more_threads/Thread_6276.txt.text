hello my computer crashed after i blew all the dust out of the machine. i bought a new one and want to transfer my old files but my old computer won't turn on. i have seen lots about file trasfers but they all require the old computer to be on. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
runs for 20 to 50 bucks and fairly simple to use. bob
external drive for whatever use you want to put it to. either way you've got to remove the old drive so you could also open up the new pc and connect it internally to get the data off. let us know how it works. vapcmd
you could find out who makes your new computers hard drive...and go to their site and d/l their hard disk upgrade software. you still have to go through connecting it to your new machine but most of the software now will make a flawless copy to your new drive and if you like you can leave your old drive &lt;info intact&gt; in a box incase you have the problem again. sounds like a lot of work but fast is not always best...applies to life too...lol
and can you designate the target location ...like a folder? or is it a disk to disk copy,...partitions and all ? if not, wouldn't that method result in overwriting whatever's on the new system hdd with what was on the old system ? vapcmd
i can't remember the one that does for sure... i think it is seagate. i just did it recently on my old nas box.
