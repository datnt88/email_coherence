my old hp pavilion dv9207us stopped working and i purchase a new hp pavilion dv3-2155mx notebook. the old computer will not start up. i pulled out the external hard drive (western wd 1200bevs) sata 2.5&quot; and purchased a thermaltake blacx docking station (p/n: st0005u) to transfer data onto my new notebook. it says it should easily transfer sata 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; hard drives. i am cannot connect my hard drive to it. do you know why?
the dock looks to be the right part but you'll have to tell more.
itis actually an internal hard drive(the wd 1200bevs). the connection &quot;teeth&quot; on the internal drive do not appear to map directly into the docking station. is there any other information i should provide?
the dock looks right to match your sata 2.5 inch laptop drive. now having said that, i found this docks to be rather flimsy and non-intuitive when it slides &quot;home.&quot; you have the right parts. here's a cable i use instead of the docks. -&gt;  (many out there like that.) bob
