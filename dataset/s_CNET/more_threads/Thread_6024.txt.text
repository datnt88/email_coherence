recently my computer has been crashing for no apparent reason. i originally thought that the processor was overheating so i vacuumed out the cooling fan on the cpu. i also vacuumed the power supply box. i've reformatted the hard drive and reloaded windows xp sp2. i also replaced the network card after the crashes started. it worked fine for about 4 days and then started crashing again. i have 1ghz of memory and a 1.86ghz processor. a local computer store ran some utility programs on it. they didnt find any problems. im stumped at this point. it usually happens after a lot of applications have been used. i would appreciate any suggestions that you may have. thanks.
is this one of those old socket a systems? as they age you might find some bad caps (see google.com) and the fix is to replace the boards with the bad caps. i can assure you the reason for the crash is not revealed in your post. the clues are not there. keep telling more and try to tell about your pc since you may not have 1 ghz of memory. bob
sorry. i meant gigabyte of memory. i hadn't thought about a bad cap on the motherboard. i need to research it further. thanks.
