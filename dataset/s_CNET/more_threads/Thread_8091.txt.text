in reading various articles i'm more confused on what to buy than ever. my family gets in the internet, used ms office, does some minor playing around with pictures, really just simple basic stuff. i'm looking for a recommendation on a low end computer desktop (box only) to buy. does anyone have a suggestion on what to get that fits this user description? we'd like to be in the sub-$600 range too. thanks all, mark
i suggest looking at an hp. it is a middle range brand with good quality. another good brand is lenovo and for $500 you'll find something nice with either brand. since you dont need anything fancy, look for something with these specs: * intel core i3 -or- intel core 2 duo -or- amd athlon ii * 3 or 4 gigabytes of memory * 500gb hard drive or more * windows 7 i've read not to bother with any warranty they offer because usually problems occur within the first year and the manufacturer should cover that. here's a few i've picked out for your price range. hopefully this helps =)
if you want to go cheaper than that, i suggest these brands in this order: *compaq *asus *gateway *dell *emachines *acer
