after installing and uninstalling a hard drive, and installing a 56k modem, whenever i boot up the pc i get the message - &quot;com a configuration changed&quot;, then the option to press f1 to resume or f10 to enter set-up. everything looks fine in the settings, i have even tried resetting defaults. pc works fine when resuming, but the boot process stops until f1 or f10 is pressed. i installed the 2nd hard drive to move from old pc (p90 dell) to the compaq. pc is a compaq presario 4528, 233 mgh, 32 mg ram, 3 gig hard drive, win95 platform. thanks for any help someone can provide. mrepos
233 mhz computers may use older isa modem cards which you set the serial port to com1 or such. when you do this, you learn that the motherboard port at the same address may need to be disabled. bob
i disabled com2 in system properties. error gone!!!! thank you bob, i really appreciate your help.
excellent resolution to this post/bios error after switching in some newer hardware. i actually disabled both com 1 and com 2 in system properties because the new modem was using com 3. worked like a charm! thanx to bob i can finally move on to other things. art
