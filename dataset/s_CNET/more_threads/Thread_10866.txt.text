i have created a workgroup for my two laptops which run windows xp home. i can see whatever it is i want to share on each of the computers. my question is, can anyone else see my files/folders without the group name? thank you. jeff
unsaid and cannot be fully answered until the details or your two node network are revealed. router/wired/wireless/security enabled are all needed info.
i am using a wireless router for my interenet connection to both computers which is unsecured.
in which case your workgroup will be exposed when not protected by wep/wpa and or mac filtering. you may wish to disable ssid broadcasting and change the default name and password of the router.
my router is password protected but the ssid is not &quot;protected&quot; is that ok?
turned on or off. i've found that mac filtering is usually enough in most home environments since many will trip over wep/wpa encryption.
it is enabled wep is an open system and it says wep is disabled.
to what has been suggested. have you enabled mac filtering, this is the easiest and least troublesome of the security options in a router.
enable mac filtering now and see what happens. i am checking the button only allow computers with mac addresses listed below to access the network. it then lists my computers in the dhcp client drop down list so i'll see what happens. thank you.
