(this program can easily let a virus onto the pc... torrent downloads are generally safe, but not limewire- it opens a door for viruses.) are there any other signs of malware, especially slow performance? is the poor performance limited to games? if you're confident that the problem is not a virus, then some other questions would be: how many processes does your pc have running in the background? has anything new besides games been installed since this problem began? (try reducing the unnecessary processes running in the background by using msconfig or another program.) try uninstalling the driver for your video card and reinstalling it. do you use the ati catalyst control center? if so, set it so that the application controls the graphics quality. also try closing out the ati ccc, to see if that would make a difference- you can end its process from the task manager. has there been anything else installed such as a sound card? if so, try disabling this device. if hardware failure is causing this problem, that would be rare and more difficult to diagnose. does the fan on the card run any louder since the problem began? if so, that would again be a sign that something in the background is taking up processing power, forcing it to work harder. hope this helps, glen

(how shall i put this?) mature. in recent weeks i have seen a problem that i did not expect on two xp computers that came to me for repair. both users were online gamers. on both computers, everything checked out on every diagnostic test i could run. although some of the drivers and firmware were older versions, none of that should have caused any problem. it turned out that both were infected by unknown viruses, and both viruses successfully evaded the anti-virus applications that were installed on the machines (freeware avira in one case and rather expensive norton 360 on the other, both fully up to date). both computers had slowed significantly and none of the usual fixes (av scans, spyware removal, disk and system area defrags using perfectdisk, registry cleaning and optimization, free space wiping) sped them up appreciably. rootkit scanning using various tools did not reveal any problem. my fix worked nicely, but it was a very drastic, last-resort fix -- a complete wipe of the disk and reload of the o/s and all latest drivers, including flashing the bios with the latest version. now they run like (actually better than) new, but restoring all the data and applications (except the garbage stuff) took a couple of days in each instance. sometimes computers are affected by hardware problems, but these problems almost always manifest themselves more drastically than mere performance slowdowns. they more usually cause problems like crashes, endless reboot cycles, or refusal to boot at all. i would look to a software issue, and that is not necessarily good news for you.

(oh yeah; i'm pretty sure that 3gig in an xp system is 1 gig of unused memory - i think it only supports 2 gig.) last idea is to check your virtual memory settings - right click on my computer/advanced/advanced and you'll find it - check what size it is and where it is - then check the drive it is on and how much space is left and maybe increase the size of the virtmem file, or move the file to another drive with more room on it. also run a cleanup on your drive to free up space; that may give the program more room to flex its gaming muscles, and be sure to empty out your recycle bin and temp files at the very least. finally - i'm sure you've done this, but make sure your video drivers are the latest and greatest. good luck, cod4 is a great game, if overly short in single player mode - multiplayer mode will frustrate you until you find the right server to play on - there are a plethora of cheaters and beaters out there that suck the fun out of a great multiplayer game; i've played a lot and finally 'retired' - they're just too good for me to beat.

15149	76	374122	3219161	3201143	jaybee48	1/11/10 6:40 am	1.263192e12	couldn't agree more....	i had a very similar experience with sapphire gfx cards, starting with a radeon 9800 pro in my old 32-bit athlon xp3000 rig; initially the whole system was on water cooling because of the t'bred's habit of getting very hot very quickly. when i built the first a64 system (msi 7049) i used the 'old' 9800 gfx card, but reverted to aircooling, as the a64 cpu's didn't warrant the use of water; however very shortly after the build it became apparent that the gpu was in trouble - temps up to 75 - 80 deg c, even with an auxiliary side fan blowing directly onto the card. the display showed exactly the same characteristics that darren has described, and after a few hours' use failed altogether in a most bizarre fashion. i've since had a pci-e (hd2600 pro) card go exactly the same way, but a 2800pro made by asus has no such problems, and nor has the multimedia 3850 card made by gigabyte, so i can only assume that the cheaper cards are marginal at best. jb.

15149	78	374122	3219889	3201143	haloviper	1/11/10 9:05 pm	1.2632439e12	nothing wrong with sapphire	i own a small computer store in which i build, sell, upgrade and repair computers. i have installed many sapphire cards in the computers that i have sold in the last 4 years and have had only one that i had to replace for a customer. i am currently running 2 sapphire hd 4870 cards crossfirex in one of the computers that i game on and also have them moderately overclocked and for the last 18 months they have given me great service with no sign of failing. i am using stock cooling on these cards. under load, playing crysis at the highest settings, the temps have never gotten over mid 60c. sound like just the bad luck of getting 3 defective ones. oh, and the type of case that they are in and the cooling characteristics of the case will have a bearing on the heat generated.

15149	81	374122	3220285	3220095	mcne	1/12/10 9:53 am	1.26328998e12	hardware check first	i went through the posts with all good suggestions rather fast but still haven't seen full system spec. agp system requirements are different than that of pci-e systems where the power supply is concerned. since the system ran fine for some time then started having hiccups, i would check the power supply first. either using a millimeter or the hardware monitor in the cmos setup utility (bios) check the output of the +3.3v rail, if it is any lower than 3.14v, that is where the problem is; agp cards do use the +3.3v rail, for instance, the 9800 gtx agp, draws 16.5a from the +3.3v rail without going in to the additional large molex as well as other rails providing juice directly from the agp socket! most newer power supplies are designed for pci-e systems with +3.3v rail with a max out put of 20a, if we had you full system spec, we could recommend a power supply to use in your current system and still be able to move it to a pci-e system when you upgrade. ocz stealth xstream 600w is what i am using with my a7n8x-e deluxe, barton 3200+ and your exact card which is more hungry then the 9800 gtx agp. this ocz has 36a on the +3.3v rail as well as 4 +12v rails with one dedicated to the pci-e plug #1 then the 4 +12v rails yellow wires are distinguished with a different color strip that make power distribution easy. if your +3.3v rail has fallen bellow 3.14v and/ or you have exceeded the max output of your +12v rail /s and/ or the max combined output of the (+3.3v & +5.0) + (+12v) rails, there is your issue right there. a new proper power supply carefully selected as per each rail's output and not by wattage, would most certainly bring some life back in to your system even if there has been minor damage to the board's capacitors and/ or regulators. after all the hard ware check, we could concentrate on the state of your os, updates, patches drivers and such. few points to consider in case you do not post your full system spec including the make and model of your power supply including the readings for max out put in amps per rail. most newer drivers are designed for pci-e systems, newer chipsets and so on; an older driver might work better with your chipset and setup. after considering all suggestions for cooling and all, ensure that the first pci slot after the agp slot is not used, i believe this vid card covers it any way. if using any sound card, try using the 2nd pci slot if possible. check all capacitors for bulging and/ or leaking. for a p4 agp based system, consider a power supply with around 30a on the +12v rail, around 25a for the +5.0v rail and at least 30a on the +3.3v rail. happy computing
