i have a cable modem that is also my wireless router. i have a desktop connected to my router and two laptops at home. is there any way to log the usage of the wireless connection from the desktop? i want to know when the wireless was used, what hours of the day (what they were using it for is less important but might be nice). i know there are programs that i can track if i install them on the laptop, but for this case that is not possible. amy ideas? -mijo
see if you can find it inside your router/modem (acessabe by your browser)....if you have set the time and date on it, it probably contains a log file, but it has to be turned on ....
can yo suggest step by step instructions on how to get that done?
