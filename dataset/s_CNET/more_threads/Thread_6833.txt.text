i have a computer service business that i started over a year ago that i run out of my house. one thing that i don't have it some diagnostic utility to test hard drives. when a customer suspects that their hard drive is going bad, i'm not really sure how to check that out. is there some utility that can be used for this purpose? suggestions? thanks.
are from the hard drive's maker. where? their web site. bob
like bob said...each hdd mfg has free diagnostic sw to test their hdds available on their repsective websites. it's must have software. vapcmd
