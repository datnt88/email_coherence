7143	2	373964	3200237	3199951	krubby	12/17/09 8:13 pm	1.26108078e12	thanks / one last question (i hope)	just for clarification: are you saying if i go from 1gb to 2gb i won't get much more than a 2% or so improvement? or that if i go much beyond 2gb i won't get much more? in regards to what i am doing, yes i should of been more clear. for the basics i don't have any issues at all - email, internet, excel and word stuff etc. the only reason i am thinking about a bump up is when i go to download either a huge number of photos and edit them or when i am creating dvds. i know the additional memory may not actually cause the burn of the dvd to occur faster, nor do i care that much - i run it before i head to bed. but the editing, dumoing of a lot of video, comes to a crawl at times. i figured especially if i only do about 2gb for $50.00 if it helped it would be worth it. so given that, sorry for the additional question but do you think at least bumping to 2gb would help? and if so are you saying that might but then beyond 2gb is just overkill, especially with an older processor etc. thanks again for your help
