10102	5	343117	3046022	3045660	steven haninger	5/18/09 4:15 am	1.2426201e12	to add to other advice	i'll ask how old the battery is. if it's relatively new, i'd remove it from the device and store it in a cool and dry environment. if it's and oldie (3 or more years), i'd do the same but consider having a replacement handy. lead acid batteries tend to develop a metallic sulfate coating over time and especially when allowed to discharge. these sealed types will also develop bulges. if you notice such happening, it's time to replace it anyway.
