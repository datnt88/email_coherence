i have a gigabyte 7vm400m-rz motherboard, amd sempron 2400, 256mb of ram and im running xp pro. im currently using the onboard video that is sharing 32mb of my ram. i just purchased 1gig of extra ram and an apg 8x video card that is to be installed this week. i was just wondering the benefit i would get, if any, of overclocking. in my cmos the clock speed is set @ 166mhz. is this where i would overclock it? if so how much would be &quot;safe&quot;?
separate video. vapcmd ps ...recommend against the overclocking, at least for now.
i wont do any overclocking yet. thanks
overclocking can boost your computer's performance in a huge way. but you need to study up on your computer and see what you should expect out of your hardware. although there is a great benefit from overclocking, at the same time there is a risk of damaging your hardware if not done properly. good luck!!!
yeah, that would be where you would overclock. a few more settings, but that is the beef of it. now, you want faster games, right? then mainly focus on overclocking your gpu, which is much more simpler and will give you the larger benefit. bumping the cpu will help some, as it is a probable bottleneck, but do the gpu first. if it isn't what you are looking for, try the cpu. but please, don't just go into the bios and start changing settings. please read the *many* guides on the internet. they'll show you how in a few minutes. ~ibrahim~
