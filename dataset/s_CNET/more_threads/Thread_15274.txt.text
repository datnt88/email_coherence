i'm on a free wifi provided by the community, so i shouldn't complain. but i will anyway, i just need some ammunition. when i go to  i usually get 4,000 kbps down, 1,000 kbps up, or so. when i'm actually trying to * use * the internet, things get tricky. i get hung browser, page not found, no connectivity, etc. a page either loads rapidly, or not at all, with no rhyme or reason. is there a utility that i can use to check the * reliability * of my connection? something that i can create a log, and send to the network people and embarrass them. or, is it possible i have configuration problems? i'm using windows vista home premium, with a dell 1395 wireless card. thanx. dave
try the change noted in our forum sticky at  beyond that, ask around if others using this connection get the same performance.
i think that's what you were pointing me to... here's a sample ping log: the connection is usually pretty fast, or non-existent. i'm thinking the problem is with the wifi provider... ====================================================== pinging  [18.7.22.83] with 32 bytes of data: reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=144ms ttl=237 reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=134ms ttl=237 request timed out. request timed out. reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=174ms ttl=237 reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=136ms ttl=237 reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=137ms ttl=237 request timed out. request timed out. reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=138ms ttl=237 reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=120ms ttl=237 request timed out. reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=3984ms ttl=237 reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=198ms ttl=237 request timed out. request timed out. request timed out. reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=144ms ttl=237 reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=212ms ttl=237 reply from 18.7.22.83: bytes=32 time=126ms ttl=237 ping statistics for 18.7.22.83: packets: sent = 20, received = 12, lost = 8 (40% loss), approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: minimum = 120ms, maximum = 3984ms, average = 470ms
since its a community shared resource, its all too likely people are running p2p downloads or torrents. there is no fix you can do on your machine for that. shared access or free will be unreliable. sometimes it takes many times and many people to understand this. bob
probably right, guess i need my own connection.
