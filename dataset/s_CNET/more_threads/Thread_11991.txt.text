i was wondering if the following was good for a basically mild gaming, then some multitasking. and if everything was compatable, etc. thanks in advance...the parts are listed below case -  motherboard -  cpu -  power supply -  cpu cooler -  hard drive -  graphics card -
you're forgetting the memory. btw, that's not what i would consider a budget pc with a 8800gts. you might want to get the socket am2 instead of socket 939.
i really wouldnt call getting a 8800gt a &quot;mild&quot; gaming pc because that gpu is for people that like gaming and are preparing for directx10 hope this helps
if you are doing mild gaming, you don't need that nice a graphics card. infact, you would be fine with agp or maybe even integrated graphics. a pny vetro 6600 (not gt) 256 agp card will do fine. i have one in an older computer and it can run halo, counterstrike, ect, and unless your playing batlefield 2 or something you'll be fine. this will also save you some $ on the motherboard, but good call on the asus. stay with that brand. key part missing. ram. get 1 gig of fairly fast ram and you should be fine. and finaly you don't need a 3800+ proccessor. a 3200+ will suit your needs perfectly. trust me. i have tested many products, and you'll be fine with these.
