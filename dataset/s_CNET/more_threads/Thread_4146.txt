(again, the the drive that uses the connector in the middle of the cable is the primary slave.) drives plugged into cable going to ide 2 are the secondary master and secondary slave. you'll see the drives being recognized with those names during the bios post. note the system usually hunts thru the drives in that order until it finds a disk it can boot from. another hint, if you have 2 drives, put the second drive and the cd rom on the secondary connector, leave the primary master all to itself on its own cable, may speed things up a little. clear as mud? - fj
