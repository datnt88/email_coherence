my desktop hard drive recently failed, and i need to purchase a new one. problem is, i've never replaced a hard drive before. my desktop's specifications are here:  what kind of hard drive should i purchase? will any sata hard drive be compatible with my computer? i can't afford something exceedingly expensive. space should be between 1-2 tb. would this work with my computer?  thanks, and sorry for all the links.
hard drive 1 tb size: 1 tb interface: sata transfer rating: 3.0 gb/sec rotational speed: 7200 rpm \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ those are your specs above. they are for a sata type drive. you can install a 2-2tb no problem, even a 3tb one if you like as your os is win7, will readily accept it. the hd link appears not to be an issue, will work. however, i do suggest you update the bios so it can accept any changes that hp provides or deems so. hp if you follow the instructions should provide info on os re-install and hd replacement, please review it for model# or generic details. tada -----willy
thanks. i placed an order for the hard drive i linked to, the caviar green one. it should be here within a few days. i couldn't find exact instructions on how to replace my old hard drive with the new one, once i get it. there are a lot of tutorials online but a point in the right direction would be great. hopefully it all works out when i get my hd.
