(it won't appear if you just try ncpa.cpl, but it is there...) i also tried those ip addresses you mention + the subnet masks, but the only thing that worked was adding the ip address of the other computer in the default gateway... i found this solution &quot;hidden&quot; in a thread, so obviously not a well-known solution, but it worked!
