i just purchased a motorola sb5120 in order to take advantage of adelphia's new premier high-speed internet. however, my speed is only marginally faster than my old sb2400 and nowhere near the advertised 6mb/sec. do i need to configure anything to achieve these speeds?

its connected to an everex explora rs2800 via an ethernet cable. i am running windows xp with 256 mb of ddr sdram. it has 10/100 lan.
have you tried power cycling your modem? unplug the modem from the power source, wait one minute, plug it back in and when all the blinky lights are back doing there thing, reboot the computer.
are you protected behind a router? have firewall, antivirus, antispyware installed? google: sb5120 adelphia you get some forums stating that the sb5120 is incompatible with adelphia extreme hsi. recommended modems:  from adelphia site: &quot;if you have questions about support of your docsis-certified modem, please contact us via our e-mail support form .&quot;
