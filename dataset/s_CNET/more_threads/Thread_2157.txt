10388	0	391235	3290021	nr	valeve	4/20/10 1:17 pm	1.27176942e12	i think there is a printer sabotager in my house.	i have three printers and not a one works properly. one is an hp photosmart c4480 (all-in-one) which prints for my mac os x, 10.6.3. it was working ok for a while and now it only prints blacke. even pictures come out black. i have bought new cartridges and downloaded the latest software. the next pc. is a dell dimension 2400 using winxp i pretty much rebuilt after hurricane charlie got through with it. anyway, i have a kodak, easyshare (all in-one) printer with that and it won't do anything with black. it will print in colour but looks very much like a negative. new cartridges installed and the latest software downloaded. i bought a used printer to help me get by while i tried to solve my problems. it's an h.p deskjet 5650. i invested in two new cartridges and plugged it into my ibm laptop thinkpad. strange thing is, it will print a beautiful hp in blue at thebottom of the page and hp deskjet 5600 ,  at the top. i should mention that a while ago i had them all wirelessed and could print on one printer from all three. trouble stared when we bought the mac which i hate! i'm quite good with windows although both of my othe pc's are running winxp&gt; apart from being frustrating, it's getting expensive and my computer illiterate husband is sure that i am the problem. if have always thought that most of you moderators are geniuses and hope someone can advise me. thanks, hopefully, val fasig
