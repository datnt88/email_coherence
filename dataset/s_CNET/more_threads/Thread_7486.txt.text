i have 2 computers a. desktop running win xp wired b. laptop running win vista wired/wireless (wireless preferred) and i'm trying to connect them both together in such a way that i may transfer files between the 2 computers. they are both going through a wireless router and both have internet access with out any problems. i've searched the web looking for tutorials, but all end in complete failure. so any help would be much appreciated. if i'm missing details please ask and i'll add asap
also i can't tell why you have any issue. no error messages or what you tried so let's skip to easy.
the network setup wizard. run it on both machines, turning on file and printer sharing. give them both the same network name. voila.
worked nice and easy... thanks for the simplistic idea. ...and the other guy i wanted ideas/theories
