11952	5	285026	2712565	2712393	ramarc	2/23/08 9:36 am	1.20375936e12	ok	since you mentioned the mac, i thought you just didn't want to spend mac cash but still wanted something mac size (compact and clean design). i priced that build so you'd have room in your $2k budget for a big 24+&quot; or dual 22&quot; monitors (about $500), a pro-audio solution with at least 4in-4out, midi i/o, and spdif i/o ($300+), and a pair of powered studio monitors. unless you need 4tb of storage, don't get 4 hard drives. a matrix array of dual 750gb drives will yield a mirrored 200gb boot volume and an ultra-fast 1tb data volume. matrixing dual 1gb would yield a 200gb boot and 1.5tb data volume. and remember that there'll always be bigger and faster hard drives available each year. so don't spend money on space you won't be using. you're said you're not into gaming and i assume you're not overclocking. so, a gaming case like the thermaltake would be for looks only. since you're into music production i also assume you want a quiet pc. so any quiet case you like with a 120mm exhaust fan will be more than adequate for a midrange pc. antec p180, very quiet, $109 antec sonata iii w/500w ps, quiet, $110 coolermaster cavalier, quietness depends on power supply, $75 corsair 550w btw, all the cases above have slots for 4 internal 3.5&quot; drives. as for dual vs. quad core, photoshop is the only app you've listed that could take advantage of 4 cores. but the q6600 (2.4ghz) would be slower in all other apps. the e6750 is the same speed as the e6700 (2.66ghz) but $150 less. the best mainstream dual core now is the core2duo e8400 (3ghz) which runs about $240 (but will fall in price in early march). here's my suggested mobo msi p35 neo2-fr .

11952	7	285026	2713839	2713360	ramarc	2/24/08 3:17 pm	1.20386622e12	quad cores only faster in some software	photoshop is optimized for quad cores, but other apps (like illustrator) don't show much benefit going from 2 to 4 cores because of thread synchronization issues. that's also especially true of most music software. they optimize for 2 threads but not 4. so a fast dual core (3ghz e8400) will outperform a slower quad core (2.4ghz q6600/2.66ghz q6700) in all of your apps except photoshop.
