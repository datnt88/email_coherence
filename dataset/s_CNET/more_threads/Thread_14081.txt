''formatting largr hd's into more than one partition is done all the time.'' it is much better to write that partitioning larger hd's into more than one partition is done all the time. the formatting, of course, comes after that.

1809	14	201613	2175818	2171959	merranvo	9/3/06 2:13 am	1.15724958e12	a note on bios upgrades	they should only be preformed in the utmost need... you see there is a chance that when you upgrade your bios that the flash transpher will be corrupt and if your bios does not have an backup copy of the original you are seriously screwed.

1809	18	201613	3034218	3034044	vapcmd	4/28/09 7:25 pm	1.2409467e12	your reply was to a post from 2006. . . too late to be of	any help i'm afraid. and according to your reference ..which is consistent with my experience, the limitation pertains to a jumper on the hard disk drive as indicated below...not the mb 2. jumper setting limiting hard drive space a minimal mistake of inserting the jumper into hard disk jumper block will result in limiting the hard disk capacity to 32gb if hdd is of higher capacity or 2.1gb otherwise. the first and last jumper block confusion will lead to such problem. the first placement will be for master, and last for limiting, users confuse it and find their hard drives limited to 32 gb. refer to this diagram which illustrates the jumper usage in hard drives.
