(and even then, you may possibly have problems with display/sound/modem etc) take that same hd and put it in a win98 machine, and i will wager it will never boot up... .

7999	17	108890	1244510	1240745	orionleingod	6/15/05 5:14 am	1.11881244e12	i agree	i have to agree with this. ive taken my old hard drive out of my old computer, and put it into a freshly built computer, and it ran just fine. sure some programs had problems but that was complelty cause of things i installed. other than that the drivers installed for the new hardware, except for a few i had to add through a cd.
7999	18	108890	1244545	1240273	orionleingod	6/15/05 5:36 am	1.11881376e12	consider this	if what they have been saying about not being able to change too much of the hardware, then consider this. if that was the case you would not be able to do serious updates to your hardware like i have done, and i know many others have to. for a friend, who had xp installed on a gigabyte k7 triton motherboard, with an amd athlon 2000+ cpu, 512mb ddr2700 ram, and a gainward gnvidia geforce fx 5200, to a amd athlon 3000+, 3 sticks of ddr3200 512mb ram, and an nvidia geforce fx 5600 on his b-day. the harddrive had no problems. sure he had to install alot of new drivers, but other than that it was just fine. like i said in my last post as well, i have moved a hard drive from one system to another, one with completly diffrent parts. xp does build a list of hardware, but it doesnt stop working when those go away. if that were the case you wouldnt be able to upgrade. saying it only happens if, &quot;too much&quot; of the hardware is upgraded would be even worse coding than microsft is known to make.
