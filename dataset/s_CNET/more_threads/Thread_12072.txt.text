i am getting blurry images and pictures in the 17&quot; dell monitor. in order to get a clean page, i click the right button of the mouse and go to &quot;refresh this page with full quality&quot;. please let me know how to correct the problem once and for all. thank you.
if lcd, are you using an analog or digital connection on the video card? toni
since you emailed me with the model number of it...  i would think the refresh rate needs to be adjusted in display, settings, advanced and go to the monitor tab to see what it's defaulting to now and adjust it to what the specs are at the link i gave....no higher than 60 hz from what i can see. toni
it turns out that it was an internet accellerator program that caused it to happen and when she turned off/disabled that program, the monitor went back to normal. kudos to yewanchors for finding the solution....i hadn't considered it to be anything other than a hardware issue. toni
