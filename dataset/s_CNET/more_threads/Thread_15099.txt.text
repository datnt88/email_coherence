i want some opinions out there. if saving money and getting more for your money was your main concerns, what would be better, building your own pc from the ground up or buying a pre-configured one??? i have a good source to build one, but i don't know if i want all the hassle that goes along with that. i've had a pc built for me before by a family friend and it was just too much hassle to take it over and see if he had the time to fix it etc. but i don't want to pay huge inflated prices for a pre-config'd system either, but have any repairs be easier. the one i'm considering has a few extended warranties built into the price already. i'm not a gamer, video editor-type, just a basic surfer, who does a little business on my system.
i'm not a gamer. if i price out the parts for a pc and a monitor and software i can't come close to what i can buy a package deal for. but that assumes that all the parts of a pkg deal are of any value to you. i'm not looking to buy a new machine but every so often i visit dell's bargain shop.....nice stuff....yesterdays model....cheap. there is a benefit to building your own. you gain a certain amount of knowledge about how the parts fit together and when it does not work quite right 'you' just go in an fix it.
low-end pcs ($500 or so) can't be beaten price-wise, but they are usually either bottom barrel components or have little, if any, expanision capabilities. once you move up to a mid-range pc ($1000), building your own becomes more competitive. when you build your own, you can choose where you want to put your money (ram vs. cpu for example) and tailor it far better than any custom configurator.
