i recently bought a seagate 160 gb external hd to use as a backup. prior to this i would save any documents on floppies but now with digitial photos and program disks missing (not lost just temporarily misplaced), i wanted to be able to do a full backup. when i used the xp backup wizard i received an error stating that i could not create a file lager than 4gb due to fat32 formatting on the external drive. my question is there someway around this in backup; do i have to reformat the external drive in ntfs or do i have to buy 3rd party software? thanks, rick
what feature does msbackup have that is worthy? bob
i assume that if a virus struck my computer, that i could just reformat the hard drive, drag and drop back from my external drive and everything would work ok. i thought that msbackup would compress everything and simplify the restore process. rick
msbackup can't restore to a blank drive. at least with simpler copy methods, all your files are saved. -&gt; maybe a solution like acronis should be explored? bob
