(the 945, 946, 965, and 975 chipsets are required for dual-core pentium-d; 945 and 975 chipsets may support core2duo depending on the motherboard; 946 and 965 definitely support core2duo.) your motherboard is made by intel. there's a good chance it will support a p4-3.4ghz. i don't know if $100 is worth it for a 13% cpu boost:  you could replace your motherboard and cpu to get to core2duo. your hard drive, cd/dvd, ram, and video card can be reused. intel dg965ss, $120:  core2duo e6300, $190:  vista home premium, $125:
