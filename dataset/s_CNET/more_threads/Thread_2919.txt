(how so, and were you able to recover the data?) -- no. (lucky you! anything you want to share about your luck?) -- not yet, but i'm starting to encounter some problems now. (what problems, and have you backed up your data?) share your experience with us if your hard drive has failed on you before. let us know what the end results were, was your data recoverable (if yes, how was it recovered) or was it lost forever?
