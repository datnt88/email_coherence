hi. i'm currently searching for a hardware transcoding pci card. i use adobe premier pro 2.0 as my non-linear editor. what are some hardware options for accelerating my rendering times? i'm also looking for a way to easily transcode (with hardware acceleration) various formats to mpeg2, m2v or vob files, for export to dvd. thanks. computer specs: p4 (prescott) 3.2e 1.5 gb memory 200 gb 7200 seagate ata133 2x200 gb 7200 seagate sata 150 raid 0 ati radeon 7900 agp 8x
some of your system hardware information looks, sketchy, but generally i would suggest looking here:  here:  or here:
such hardware rendering were really just dedicated cpu(s) and some hardware on a board so it's speed depended on how many dollars you pumped into it. now we have a simple financial issue to solve. since the real fast boards are over 1k why not go get that quad core intel cpu from gateway or hp that is hovering at the 1k mark? bob
