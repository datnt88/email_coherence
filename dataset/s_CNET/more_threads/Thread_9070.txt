[just the opposite for wd drives] the mobo reporting udma5 is an error according to scott mueller's book. upgrading and repairing pc'sa [17th edition] quote is from the book. hope that this does not violate copyright laws. &quot;note that because sata is designed to be backward-compatible with parallel ata, some confusion can result because sata drives can report speeds and modes that emulate parallel ata settings for backwards compatibility. this means the drive is merely lying for backwards compatibility with existing software.&quot; &quot;udma 5 is is ata 100 [parallel ata mode at 100 mbps] while the slowest serial mode [1.5 gbps] is 150 mbps and ultra dma modes simply do not apply to serial ata drives.&quot; &quot;the serial ata spec actually requires that the reply to the identify device command are to be set as indicated in ata/atapi 5.&quot;

2462	3	239954	2440913	2440854	ray harinec	3/25/07 9:59 am	1.17481674e12	as the words from the book said	that info is intentionally incorrect. that is not the cause of your problem. [i did not say that it was not good that the drive was on udma 5] is it possible that that whatever you used for the speed test does not support sata drives? my reply was basically to tell that the udma 5 was not actually correct, but was intentional reported as such by the sata specification to maintain compatibility with ata software. that does not control the speed of the data transfers, your mobo controller shoud do that. [actually the controller is on the card inside the drive] the chipset on the mobo talks to that controller. i erred in not telling you to first go to the seagate site to verify that your drive came defaulted with the jumper on for the 150 or not. please go there and enter the drive model to double check the jumpering. if the system got unstable after you removed the jumper, you should check things at the seagate site. what make and model is your computer?? i am assuming that you are not using some kind of adapter to use a pata port to interface the sata drive. i am not an expert on measuring the transfer speed, never bothered to check in 20 years or so. again, my info was simply to advise you that the udma 5 was incorrect but intentional by spec. hopefully robert proffitt or ed o'daniel can help.

2462	5	239954	2440902	2440927	jézus	3/25/07 10:47 am	1.17481962e12	yepp	of course yes its connected to the sata port my pc is ready made from the store theres nothing with the test but i've runned some other benchmarks. i can see how slow it is without it (ex.: flashget mallocing disk space for 150meg for about 2mins) i've also downloaded seagate diagnostic program - seatools which says there is something wrong but it doesnt what it is... im wondering about: if some settings are wrong if the harddrive is wrong (i have a warranty) if the motherboard chipset driver isnt installed correctly (i've tried download some new driver from intel but its the same) if something in the bios incorrect if the operating system sucks

2462	7	239954	2441004	2440979	jézus	3/25/07 11:23 am	1.17482178e12	anymore details?	i've bought the pc with this specs: drive - seagate barracuda 7200 (st3160811as) sataii motherboard : msi 945pl supports sataiias i said. its not from a manufacturer (like dell or ibm) the store should have made it from parts but its name 'optimum spc-8' (- p dual 3.4, 2*512mb 533mhz ddr ii, 160gb 7200rpm sata2 hdd, fdd, dvd +/-rw, nvidia 7300gs) yes i have reinstalled the os and then drive speed was just around 3mb/s cuz it was in pio mod i've the driver reinstalled so its in udma5 then. it think i found out the reason of the freezes could it be because is touched the sata cable? i've read somewhere this cable is very sensitive.

2462	16	239954	2441729	2440619	edward odaniel	3/26/07 9:17 am	1.17490062e12	seatools is not the correct diagnostic for sata...	you need to download and use their powermax diagnostic. powermax generates an 8 digit code if it is defective. this info and a link to the powermax is located here: my internal hard drive may be defective, how can i test it? this link will explain the use of the error code: powermax diagnostic codes - what does the error code mean and what do i do? you appear to have changed your jumper so you might want to look at this graphic to ensure that you now have it proper for the 3 gbits per sec (normal) configuration. in short, no pins jumpered together:  could also be a problem with native command queuing. is ncq enabled or disabled in your bios (or did the drivers you used support or not support it?) for the sata host controller?  poor write speeds can also result from conflict between bios version and sata driver versions. since this is such a recent purchase, i personally would waste no time taking it back and letting them (whoever built it) handle the problem.
