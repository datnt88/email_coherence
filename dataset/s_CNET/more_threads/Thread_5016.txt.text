i have an apple ibook g4. i am trying to run the smackbook program on it. i get all the way through the process until it comes time to change out the line of code in the &quot;smack.pl&quot; file. once i change it, i run the terminal correctly, and it says that there are a few errors, but it doesnt say how to fix them. help please?
fun to see someone abuse their laptop like that. good idea to accelerate product failures and hence new product sales. bob
wonderful. remind me to get more shares in apple if more people buy this app. go back and make sure you did everything correctly. check out this video from cnet  does the ibook g4 have a motion sensor? p
did you type in &quot;perl&quot;? if u didnt that might be the problem unless your laptop does not have the sensor needed:)
