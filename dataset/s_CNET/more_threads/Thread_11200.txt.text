okay i think its a stupid question but i need to settle this with my brother because hes paranoid about getting a virus... if i connect the cable modem directly to an infected computer for 10 minutes. then disconnect from that infected computer. then connect the cable modem to the router we have and have our 2 clean computer connect to the router. can the cable modem store a virus from the first computer and then transfer the virus to the 2 clean ones? keep in mind the infected computer was never connected to the router and still isnt. it was only connected directly to the cable modem directly for a short period of time. any responses would be much appreciated. thanks!
the cable modem has no storage or processor. there's no way any virus can infect a modem. viruses only reside on computers.
if you dive deep into most cable modems the firmware and such is controlled by your cable co. so for it to catch a virus means that it would currently have to originate from your network provider. as of now, there is no other known way to &quot;infect&quot; a cable modem. bob
