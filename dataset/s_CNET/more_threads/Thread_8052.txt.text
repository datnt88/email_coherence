i recently hooked up a pine external usb hdd and it worked fine but now i can't find it under my computer. device manager sees it and says its working fine but it won't come up under hard disk drives in my computer.
dell 3000, win. xp sp2, usb 2.0. i read the previous posts but saw no solution. help please!
tomcat: try another usb cable, the one you have may have a break in it. make sure the power to the device is complete. read the advice to ultra enclosure/hard disk problem above and &quot;i want the power&quot; answer. norm
