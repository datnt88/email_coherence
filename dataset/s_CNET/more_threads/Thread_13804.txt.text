i have an e machine desktop thats about 6yrs old. i have an internal seagate 100gb hdd ata 100. so i assum it's a eide or pata. cpu specs: intel celeron d 352, 3.20ghz/533mhz fsb, nvidia 8400 gs 512mb video card, 2gb ram, dvd rom/cd r+w, 10/100 ethernet 512kb l2cache. i had installed a wd 320gb, worked for a while but kept going in and out. i put ubuntu on it and it recogzied the 320gb but couldn't play any our of pc games. i have been looking for a seagate 500gb to put in but can't find one. when i tried to install the wd, it said no hard drive found. so i thought maybe it was a compatibilty issue between manufactuers. anyone have any suggestions. thanks
did you learn about drive jumpers and the differences of 40 and 80 conductor cables? i find most folk try to avoid learning such and end up at repair counters. be sure to tell all about these two items and my hint is to use the newer 80 conductor cable next time. bob
i tried all the wd jumper setting according to the manual and now my present hdd is on the middle connector of the cable which is gray. my cable does have a red stripe on one side of it.
then you would know that on cs and if you can't accept cs then only the slave setting is acceptable on the middle connector on 80 conductor ide. but then again i'm duplicating the web on that. bob
