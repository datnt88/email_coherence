i am upgrading from a sony trinitron to probably a sony or dell 19&quot; flat panel. my video card is 3 yrs old but works very well with my current monitor. what card would you recommend i upgrade to or is it necessary. the monitor will probably run around 400 so i don't want to spend too much or i might as well just buy a new computer. thank in advance.roy
your post told so little that its unlikely that you will find a ready answer. bob
using a 3 year old dell pc with a 32mb nvidia geforce2 mx 4x agp graphics card. running windows xp.hope this is enough extra info. roy
what about the rest of the system? there's no use in getting an x850 xtpe if all you have is a p3 933. i'll go ahead and say that when getting a 19&quot; lcd screen, be very careful. make sure to buy one with a response time of under 16ms, or else you'll get major ghosting in-game, as most 19&quot; lcd monitors do. i'm assuming you have a mid-range to weak computer, so i'll suggest a 9600xt
dell dimension 8100 series, pentium 4 1.5ghz, 256 rdram window xp. have wireless internet if that matters. thanks roy
who said you had to go out and buy another graphics card? hook it up(new monitor) and see how it looks and runs
