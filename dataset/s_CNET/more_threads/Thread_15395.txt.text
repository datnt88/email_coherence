i have a dilemma ,please help me, i cant choose between sony xperia z tablet, samsung galaxy note&#174; 10.1- 2014 edition and nexus 10, thank u
the only advice possible, based on the information in your post: throw a dice. 1 or 2 = sony 3 or 4 = samsung 5 or 6 = nexus kees
but why even get one? it's not that it can do as much as a common laptop and some folk are getting caught up in the fad without trying them. bob
ok i see ur logic , any recomindations on laptops?
starting with a chromebook i can get a lot done (  ) and then i can find laptops for about the same price as many tablets. a notable exception is the kindle fire hd which we get lots of us as a video player (amazon prime, etc.) and it's not much. bob
