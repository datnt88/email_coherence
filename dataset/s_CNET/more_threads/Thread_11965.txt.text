i am having some trouble setting up a network for my neightbor. both computers are running xp.one home one pro. i ahve gone through the network setup wizard on both of them. i dont know which configuration to choose so i just picked one. i think it was the defalut that comes up. i entered in all of the info and it said it was done and that i ahd to restart. so i did. i also did this on the other which connects via 802.11b. i went to my network places and tried to view the workgroup computers. each time i received a dialog box that said i couldn't access the network. it said that a server hadn't been secified. the internet works fine on both of them by the way. i have done other posts in the past and i have not provided enough info. if you need anymore. please let me know.
name, they both should be the same. turn off the firewalls until the lan is working. &quot;it said that a server hadn't been secified&quot; this sounds suspiciously like a domain had been set.
the workgroup names are both the same. i pretty sure that i didn't set up a domain in the first place. just a refresher put what is the domain again.
on the computer name tab your workgroup name or the domain you belong to will be shown. if a domain name is listed you can change by clicking the change button and switch to a workgroup.
well in order to do that you would have to be able to view the workgroup computers right.(i think) well thats when i get the error message. it comes up when i click &quot;view workgroup computers.&quot; i came home and i did what you have just explained wheere your click on the name and click on properties so i think i know what your saying. i am going over to their house tomorrow to look at it again
