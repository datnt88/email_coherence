which is better? what's the difference? my pc config is a amd sempron 2400++ socket a 256 mb ddr pc 400 inno 3d geforce 4 mx 440 agp 8x kinda sucks cause the gf 4 cant play splinter cell because it dosent have a shader.. im planning to upgrade my ddr and graphic card so please help me to choose between 6600/6600le thanks....
...show the le is the bottom of the 6600 tree. full review :  6600's in le / normal / gt are shown. geebee.
well i guess about that review you've shown me.. the big difference is the price between 6600le and 6600gt although le cuts the power lesser than the gt.. i guess i wont notice that very much... thanks for the reply..
...when your target is one of the most power hungry games, and you're considering cutting corners on graphics cards. as an indicator of just how badly anything lower than a 6600gt will do in splinter cell, and keeping with that same site, have a look :  notice the 1024 x 768, shader model 3 scores? using the frame rates as an indicator (splinter cell prefers cards with more ram), go back to the other review and look for a game there which shows similar 6600gt scores. gun metal - game 2 1600 x 1200 shows a slightly higher frame rate score for the 6600gt (20% more) than splinter cell...and look where the le comes in (don't forget to substract 20%)! gb.
6600le wont do it huh? maybe i could spend some more on a 6800gt or less and more ram maybe a 2 gig will do... i ve upgraded my pc to a athlon x2 and a 2 gig ddr2 i have a inno 3d 6200 pcie.. i think i could buy a 6800gt or a 7200... i think this would do the trick...
though i may be too late, try saving up for a 7600gt. it could play all the latest games at nearly break neck speed. though if you could go for, say a 7900gt or an x1800gto or x1900gt, then go for it.
