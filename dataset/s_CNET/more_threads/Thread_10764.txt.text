i have an ibm scsi internal hard drive that i use on a mac running os 9. my computer can no longer read the hard drive. whenever i boot up the computer it will crash if the hard drive is installed. when it is not installed it boots up fine. the hard drive came with an adapter that i think may be the cause of the problem. is this a common problem that can be fixed by purchasing a new adapter? below is all the information on the hard drive label: type: dghs comp iec-950 *ece32284* *pn59h7013* sn 6810a623gk emc p/n 072-000-123 11s59h7013zm1fv110a623 9808 please let me know if you can help me with this situation. i've searched the ibm web site but it appears they no longer have a support section for hard drives on their site. thanks for any help you can give me.
you didn't write how old the drive is, but i know that at about 5 years these drives are at the end of their lifespan and to replace such if need be. i see 20g hard disks of similar model for the 30 buck range on ebay. sounds like a cheap fix. bob
the date on the drive is august of '98 and we bought it on ebay approximately a year and a half ago. the problem is, we need to salvage some things on the drive here at our business and we're trying to figure out a way to do it. any suggestions?
sorry to hear that. try what you can, but the lesson never seems to end, does it? remember that most drives are &quot;5 year designs.&quot; the short and long of this is that they make terrible places to keep what we can't lose. bob
well, fortunately our most important stuff was backed up. it's just some minor stuff we'd like to recover that we want from it. thanks for you help though.
