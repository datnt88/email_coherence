we are using xp as an operating system in our office; all the files on every pc are place on the network drives (about 6 or 8 network drives). how can i backup or sync all network drives on an external drive which is on the server? what softwares can i use for this task? i need something that works on by schedule. the computers are pentium 4 with at least 2 gb ram, so they are far outdated and that is one of my problems. i'm using a &quot;wd my book essential 3.0&quot;, wherein if i place that in the computers they usually hang, that are why the only way to use the external is to place it in the server for continuous backup or syncing... i really need your help please, if you can guide me or show me any sites to study about this... thank you so much by just reading this and it will be a big help if you can help me out...
since windows locks and blocks access to some files when it's running i need to know if you truly meant every file. if you meant a selection of folders and the files in those folders (excluding applications and the os) then there are fine file sync software titles such as syncback, goodsync that can run on a schedule. bob
can i use syncback for back-uping or syncing a whole network drive. it consist of files like exec, doc, gint, and sort of images...? how to do it ^_^ so i think i need to install it on the server by doing a remote desktop and put the syncback there, then i connect the external hard drive (wd my book essential 3.0) also on the server...? am i doing the right thing..? thank you so much
what is that &quot;exec&quot; item? sorry, i can't tell what your right thing is. we know that we can't backup windows while windows is running. we can backup our files but not programs and apps. that's why i thought we'd get that out of the way first. syncback/goodsync run on the client pc and can backup to many things or places. i can't possibly replace the web site of those softwares but i'll start with yes to that area. bob
