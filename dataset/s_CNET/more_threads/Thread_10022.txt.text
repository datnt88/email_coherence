hi all, a guy i work with asked me to help him out. his hard drive seems to have some bad sectors and he has lost some of his data. he has since bought a new machine, and i have the hdd to see if i can retrieve anything. what he told me was that at the point of failure, his data was lost, but his wife's data was still accessible on the same drive. the drive has not been partitioned. is there anyway to retrieve the data? i have not yet plugged it into my machine to check but thought i would submit a post in the meantime. any help would be appreciated!! thanks
look up pc file inspector on google.com. do not attempt to use repair tools on that drive. you don't want to boot it or write to it. bob
...for the help with this problem as well bob! cheers!
