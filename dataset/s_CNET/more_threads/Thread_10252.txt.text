i really would like to know how to safely overclock my emachines t6412 with amd athlon 64 3400+ cpu on a micro-star ms-7184 motherboard with phoenix technologies, ltd bios that is version 6.00 pg (date: 08/19/2005). the cpu is just about 2.2 ghz at stock and i already tried to look in the bios to change the clock multipliter, frequency settings, or voltage settings, but it seems like emachines hid those settings from me, probably so they would get less service calls. and now i would like to know if there are any software programs that wold let me overclock through windows or if there is anything to do in the bios, i tell you i looked everywhere and i can't find anything in there. any help would greatly be appreciated, thank you.
...but you can download clockgen. it's not as good as overclocking through the bios, but it's the only way. here's a link to download it:
and scroll towards the end where they discuss overclocking, but be warned this is for a dual core x2, and yours is different, so the settings will be reduced. phantazy
...because it's a proprietary motherboard. all he can do is use windows-based overclocking apps.
...well i understand. thank you for all of your help guys. i guess i can just upgrade to an amd athlon 64 4000+ eventuallyand for now stick with the rated speeds.
...wait another 1-2 years and then build yourself a computer which you will be able to overclock.
i would be adding 200 mhz to the clock speed and 400 mhz to the front side bus. i would also be getting a 128 bit memory controller, oppose to a 64 bit. not to mention, i would be doubling my l2 cache to a whole 1mb. for about $250, i think that might sound pretty good.
