i wan just wondering if there are some gaming netbooks out there? at least ones of being capable to play those free mmorpgs that are out there. if not 3d gaming, could i still run mame on one? if anyone has a netbook they'd like to suggest i'd really appreciate it. i've seen the asus n10, but it's a little out of my price range.
look up these. sotnw wow others. so it must be fine on even lowly models like the acer aspire one. bob
well what computer does he have? is it a netbook?
1. the acer aspire one. the 1gb 160gb model. 2. some toshiba celeron l305 model in stock form but with 3gb ram. just the usual 16yo. both machines were in the 350 buck range. this week i see staples has a superior laptop for same. bob
