hi- i'm running a 2006 hp with xp. i bought my daughter a game for it called zoo tycoon- the ultimate. it installs alright, but then claims i need a graphics card. it's not 3-d or anything fancy. what kind of card do i need? the ones at best buy are $100 and up. can i get something cheaper? also, how do i install it? any help is so appreciated!!
gives the system requirements. they should be on the box also. this is what it says about the graphic card for the ultimate collection: &quot;32 mb graphics card with hardware transform & lighting (plus support for directx 9.0 or later, included on game cd)&quot;. so that's what you need minimally: &quot;32 mb graphics card with hardware transform & lighting plus support for directx 9.0. i suppose someone will come buy with a recommendation for you. i'm not exactly a specialist on this area. if nobody comes, visit a few hardware shops and ask them. any shop will be happy to install it for you, if you pay them the fee for it. kees
i will look for that when i am shopping. yer the best.
help you get the right video card for your system. guessing ain't the best approach. vapcmd
sometime they give you what the requirements are for the game.
