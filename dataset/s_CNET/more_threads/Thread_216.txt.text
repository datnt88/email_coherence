hi, i have windows xp installed on my desktop. i would like to install windows 2003 server on it. but system won't let me delete the partition. a message comes up &quot;unable to delete partition having system files&quot;. i can install 2003 server on another partition but the aplication which i want to install on 2003 server has script which requires 2003 server to be installed on c drive. it is not even letting me change the drive letter from &quot;c&quot; to any other letter- message- &quot;can't change bootable drive&quot;. any way out? please... thanks
boot the server disc, delete the xp, and install.
