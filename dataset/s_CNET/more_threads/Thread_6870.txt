(geeksquad guys at best buy checked it i didnt replace that part). im not sure what to troubleshoot next or what else could be preventing my computer from powering up. motherboard?? ram?? any suggestions?? specs: emachines t2682 with intel celeron 2.6 ghz, 265mb ram, windows xp home edition

(yeah!) i hit &quot;del&quot; to look at the cmos & bios and didn't really have to change anything there, it recognized most of it. it then rolled into giving me the option of how to start windows xp, last known good config, safe mode, normally, ect. regardless of which i choose, it rolled me back into the same screen. all i have is the &quot;restore cd&quot; from emachines and when that is in i have the option of erasing my hard drive to re-install xp (didn't want to do that!!) or another option that didn't get any results. ??

15016	7	155448	1768642	1766646	hvandy	2/24/06 5:27 am	1.14075882e12	that's what it was...and sort of the ram	i changed out the motherboard and it powered right up. the next glitch was that it wouldn't boot off of the hd or even a new one i had. i brought the computer over to one of my computer junkie friends and had him stumped. he replaced swapped out the ram before it would boot up properly. so almost every part in that computer was replaced. when i get a new computer....it won't be an emachines!
