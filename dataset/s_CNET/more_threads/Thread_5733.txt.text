here is my dilema, i work at a hotel, and in the lobby we have 2 television screens we use to run daily events for the conference center. when i came into work there was nothing displaying on the screens. when i checked the machine to verify that it was on i heard the fans running. so i preformed a hard reboot. the monitor displayed the screen asking me which way i wanted to re boot computer (safe mod, normally, etc.). i selected safe mode, looked through my video card program (the video card we use is an ati all-in-wonder). everything seemed fine. than i attempted to restart in normal operating mode. when i did the blue screen displayed stating it would dump physical memory. after that when i start the computer the fans will run, but nothing will display on the monitor. the action light on the front of monitor will blink once, and nothing else will follow. what will i be needing to get this running again a new computer&quot; if so will i be able to re use the video card? any trouble shooting steps would be greatly appreciated i am at a loss for anymore things to do.
turn it all off and try again in a hour. if it works fine call the people who service the machine and tell them it's overheating. bob
did so, nothing is happening again, and i also smelled a slight burnt smell.
such devices are usually under a maintenance contract. look on the product for it. bob
