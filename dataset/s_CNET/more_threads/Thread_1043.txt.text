i have the mercury p1845gvm-p motherboard. i earlier had 128mb ddr 440 or 490 ram . i purchased a new 256 ddr-2100 ram. when i installed the new ram and restart , the display stays off and there is a beeping sound. do i have to make any changes in ths bios please help!!
the mobo doesn't seem to like the new ram. try clearing your cmos and attempting to boot again. i couldn't find a manual on your mobo, but typically there's a jumper on the mobo that must be closed (a pin block placed on it) for about 30 secs, then opened again (the pin block removed).
make sure it is pushed in correctly, if that doesnt work, take out the &quot;watch battery&quot; on your mobo, and let it sit for 30 seconds. put it back in and see if it works, if not, put the old memory back in and see if that works, than try again. you shouldnt have to change any bios settings
heard of ddr 400 [pc3200}, never heard of ddr 490, [ddr 500 is pc4000, ddr466 is pc 3700] nor ddr 2100. if that, perchance, is pc 2100, that is ddr 266, much slower than the other memory and certainly can't be expected to run at the ddr 400 clock rate.
