11186	3	601347	5497732	5497718	r. proffitt	9/12/13 4:14 pm	1.37900244e12	still the odd list.	here's what i advise. always copy someone else's design. at least i tried to save you from creating a new combo. here's what i promised later.  = 3050  = 7864 looks like you are going to very high end. seems you'd want the i7 imo. sorry about not having the time to look over the video cards but i had to scoot. bob
