hi guys, need to know if i should get a dual *simultaneous* band router. this wireless adaptor is n class with an ism maximum frequency of 2.4ghz, and a unii maximum frequency of 5 ghz. does this mean it will work in the more stable and faster 5 ghz band, or is it strictly 2.4ghz? i have to buy a new router so for $100 more, i'll get one that does both bands, *simultaneously*, but if this adaptor can't run on 5ghz, i'll save some money and just get a dual band. thanks for any help!
802.11a (u-nii) bands: 5.15 to 5.25 would mean you want 802.11a gear and not the 802.11n 5.8ghz gear i've seen. so the dual band router is unlikely to help.
interesting. i'm running it (streaming hd movies from office pc about 70 feet away) on an older g router. i'd like to get an n router for the laptop and netbooks around the house and hopefully the tv can run on it too. the only thing that would need the g is the ps3.
