i am moving my little brothers desktop pc from the old case to a new case however he doesn't have a manual on his motherboard for his pc, so i dont know where to connect the connectors for the power,reset,front usb, etc.. th computer is a compaq presario model 5bw220 and my question is is there anywhere online i could possibly find a diagram for his mobo(it is the original that came with thte system) to show where the conectors go, thanks in advance!
look at the manafactueres web site?
that was my first action however i couldnt find anything that i was looking for
if it helps i do know the model number of the board its a bmw 191767-003
the site? i know that compaq manuals have very little useful info, but not sure about the mobo connection info, that all good mobo manuals contain.
i am having the same problem with my presario mobo. if you did happen to find the pinout, could you please fwd the info to me? thx in advance..
