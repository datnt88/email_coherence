hi, i have an arris tg862 modem/router, it has a usb port entrance in the back. i would like to know if and how i can connect an external hard drive so as to use this external hd wirelessly. kind regards,
the usb is a future support item. it does nothing today. small world. i see twc used that for our home. bob
i've seen on other threads that comcast will enable the usb port for a $70 fee. any hackers out there know how to do this for free?
