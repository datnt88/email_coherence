i have a friend that has office buildings and appt buildings all within a 30 mile radius, he offered me to be the exclusive provider for phone and internet in his buildings, is it worth it to undergo this venture. and is their anything that current isp and voip providers are not doing that would benefit the customers experience or make it even harder for them not to stitch to our service (features etc.) keep in mind i would have to compete with the tenants current service providers such as at&t, verizon, idt, so i would have to offer very low prices ps. do you think this product would be the way to go if i where to deploy such a service     thank you, shimi
this is where one creates a business plan with projections and more. if they don't do this, then they shouldn't venture into this space. there are also some that won't put in the needed 18+ hours a day to launch their new business or will not have the capital to run for a few years without a profit. no business plan = no business. hope this explains it. bob
but would it be profitble? thank you, shimi
or were you trying to avoid such? bob
