the case i aquired has a lcd panel to indicate temperature labeled cpu,hdd, & vga. how are these best positioned? cpu: at the base (side) of the heat sink? hdd: on the drive itself or near the controller ic? vga: controller ic? i am hoping someone has experience with these devices and can advise what is considered optimum use. thanks, rbul
virtually all mobos have a thermistor located in the cpu socket that is probably the best place to sense cpu temp. your bios probably reads it and you can download speed fan to read it in real time. google it. for your sensor, maybe have the sensor about 1 inch above the hub of the cpu fan. both amd and intel recco the temp there to be under 38c for their heat sinks. this gives a high but in spec cpu temp, thus adjust your air flow/fans to get that well below that temp. if i had such an item [mine only has one sensor]. i would simply move them around every now and then and get a temp profile of the interior temps in the case. if you go to a new hotter en hades video card you certainly want to be sure that the air is moving through that section. [vga should be considered to be the video cards ati or nvidia chip on the card, if you have a card.]. once you establish the steady state temps at the various locations, they won't change unless you change the airflow situation. of course they will also move up and down with your room ambient temp.
thank you ray! just the 3 probes, all connected to the lcd front panel.
what products are used to afix heat sensors to pcb's, hdd's & cpu's? tape, gum adhesive, what's available? rbul1
