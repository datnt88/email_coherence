good day people!i need your help...i need some info about amd sempron and what are its strengths and weaknesses...thank you very much!!!
old socket that is at the end of its life. no 64-bit support, what more could i say. roger
low cost entry 32-bit mass market offering?
to add to what other posters mentioned, let me say in layman's term, &quot;the vw of cpus&quot; it gets you from a to z, w/o fancy overhead but don't expect a geewhiz factor, it just gets the job done on the cheap. tada ------willy
cpus on the low cost. basicaly semprons are the older 32 bit socket a athlons with a new lable. there are versions that are socket 754 and offer higher front end buss speeds but are still 32 bit. the 3100+ is $112 at newegg. but for $124 at newegg you could get the amd64 2800+. two years ago i built a pc with a amd athlon 2400+. a few months ago i did another one for a friend who wanted to keep the cost low, used a sempron 2400+. the only difference between the two is the cost of the processor. john
the socket a version is really a renamed athlon xp with a 333mhz front side bus and 400 points added to its model number. the socket 754 version is and athlon 64 with lower cache and no 64-bit extensions. however, amd is making 64-bit semprons and should be coming out around july 30, according to xbitlabs.com
