i have a hp 8775c desktop. i have a agp slot but can't figure out what it is. 2x? 4x? without opening the case to look at the slot how do you tell. if you go to hp and look at the motherboard configuration, it just has a box that says agp slot. i have looked in the pamphlet that came with it and can't figure it out.
your system could have onboard graphics gpu or a separate agp video card in the agp slot. your docs should indicate ...if not...you'll probably have to go inside. vapcmd
go into the bios to your video settings. when you enter, it should have the onboard option, agp options, and an auto configuration. when you enter into the agp options, it should have speeds indicated. if it simply says agp, or if you can select auto, a 4x/8x will do fine. if you install an agp card, disable the onboard graphics controller in the windows device manager prior to installing the card.
