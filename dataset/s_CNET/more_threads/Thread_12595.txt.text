hi all, is there anyone own a hp psc 1610 all-in-one printer/scanner ? i'v just bought one and to my dissappointment, i think the scanning quality is quite bad. attached a scanned sample here: [img]  [/img] (if cant view the above pic, goto  ) check out those straight lines in the attached picture, my original drawing is a very clean-cut straightline, very fine but my scanned result is like this. its the problem with my scanner or setting? any advise/comment? thank you regards, sean liewss80@yahoo.com

tried few times using different dpi, up to 600 x 1200 dpi...still the same. don't think it comes with money back satisfaction guarantee. i just wanna find out whether all this model have such problem or the prob with my unit only... tq
a non-performing product can be returned due to... non-performance. at 600x1200 dpi, on screen will be at most 100 dpi so it will be like looking at it at 72x under a microscope. be sure to view onscreen at something reasonable. wish i had your setup to test, but armed with only this discussion, it's defective and needs to be returned. bob
