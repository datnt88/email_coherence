i have an hp system running xp and an lcd monitor that has built-in speakers. i moved this week and now i have no sound. all the connections are in, i checked the settings on control panel etc however, i did not re-attach a microphone or webcam but i don't see how that would affect this problem. thanks in advance for the assistance.
you have the right &quot;green&quot; connected to the right &quot;green&quot; connector.
thanks! that did it.
