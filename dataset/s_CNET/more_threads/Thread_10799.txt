13962	4	286750	2723697	2723229	tizzanne	3/7/08 6:32 am	1.20487152e12	that's certainly the problem.	i know all the info i want is out there, it just doesn't seem to be collated in the one place and the person i am looking for it for is lazy and a little slow on grasping complicated things. if it is not in the one place, she will not bother doing any of it and it is for her kids safety and future benefit that i want to try and get her into the good habits from the start. as i said, she won't take a lot of notice of me, she reckons if i know it it can't be right, but she sets great store in cyber world and thinks that if it says so online, it must be right regardless of where it actually comes from. she is the type to fall for a nigerian scam. so i hope you can see where my problem lies. i do know i will be the one she comes crying to when things go wrong, but i am only a relative novice myself and don't know how to get out of existing problems, only how to try and avoid them in the first place and that knowlege base is probably incomplete too, lol. that's why i was hoping there was a beginners guide to refer her to so she might at least get some good info to set her up. thanks anyway, tizzanne
