my xp home system just started telling me that it does not detect the hard drive on boot. i used revovery from the xp install cd and ran chkdsk /p and chkdsk /f and fixmbr and fixboot. it found errors with the chkdsk /f, but i thought it fixed them. still doesn't see drives on boot. bios setup doesn't see them either. my question is: do i need a new hard drive to fix this or is it something else?
replace the cable and/or try it on another port. make sure it spins up. a poor power connector can cause this. if it does not show in the bios, xp won't see it either so don't bother with xp until until the detection problem is worked out.
help considerably if you gave us a complete rundown on your system. first thoughts are that the drive is probably ok but that you may have fallen victum to malware of one sort or another. and life goes on... jack
thanks for the info and here are the specs on the computer. i'm running xp home installed with a clean install using an upgrade from 98se. it is up to date with sp2 and all of the latest udated from microsoft. it is a micron millenia (best buy) p# 733 with 2 hard drives. i'm running awil's avast anti-virus and microsofts anti-spyware. i just did a chkdsk on the secondary drive and it read unrecoverable. i unhooked it and the pc started. guess i'm back in business. thanks again
thanks for the input. while checking the cable i decided to check the secondary drive. it reads unrecoverable with chkdsk, so i unplugged it and now the pc boots. thanks again.
