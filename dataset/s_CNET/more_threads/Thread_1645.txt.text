every time a the balloon in xp tray shows new wireless device detected the current connection to the wireless dsl router is dropped. i have selected to connect to infrastructure only. is this because of an ap/router issue or the laptop? thanks in advance -lige
did you set it up per our forum note at
hi, this is a friends network and i was volunteered to help so don't have constant access to it. i have it set up ssid broadcasting but with wep. the www from desktop browser works and that is how i did config of wireless security. the client laptop connects just fine...just gets dropped when another wireless device is detected. i have been reading that the iphones and blackberrys cause problems for ap/routers. just thought someone would have been there done that with this problem. next visit to their house i am going to change the channel and do a firmware update. thanks -lige
and will drop if some kiddy hacker runs wepcrack or similar. move to the settings we write about in our forum note. bob
