i'm currently running an extremely old piece of junk computer and im looking to build a new one. i play a lot of online games so i am looking for a powerful build in a budget. my budget is around $1,300 - $1,500. i already have speakers but need a monitor. i have decided on the graphics card (geforce 8800gt for a little under $200) and processor (q6600 for about $250). i am basically clueless as to the rest of the components like motherboard, ram (although i want 4 gb), case, etc.
i've actually decided to change the processor to the e6750. good idea or bad idea? and is it better than the q6600? the e6750 is $190 instead of the $250 for the q6600 on newegg. i still need help with the rest of the components. thanks
see this link:  btw, don't get a 256mb 8800gt -- their performance nosedives at high resolution.
i've been doing a little research on cases. is this a good case? and if so, what is a good power supply to buy with it?
if anyone isnt too busy, i still need help with the rest of my build. thanks
