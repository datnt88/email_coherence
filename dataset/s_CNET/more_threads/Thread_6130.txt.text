i spent a huge effort looking for one but i can't find one.
why? my guess is that economic 101 spoil the fun. how much are you welling to pay for one (say 1000gb) and what do you plan doing with it? just curious.
how hard you looked.   however, holographic drives are projected to initially cost around us$15,000,
they've never made it past the prototype stage.
