i will be going home soon, after finishing up a several year job i'm in. so, i've been trying to plan out how i am going to have the same setup i have now, with tv, ps3, xbox, printer, network storage, etc etc. all i have now is a wireless router, with all ports(4) being used, and a lot of things using wireless. going home, there will be even more on the network(families computers and such), so i came up with an idea.. if the idea works. i'm no networking expert, however i will be going to school to learn. anyway, my plan if possible is this.. isp - switch - 1st port to my families wireless router, and a 2nd port to my wireless router, and each in their own vlan to separate them completely from each other. i'll will only use those 2 ports on the switch. and i will connect everything i have to only my router, and the rest of the family can use just their router. is this possible? or am i way off? and if i am right do you have any suggestions for home-use switches? thank you for your help in advance.
as you will need a second internet ip it usually doubles the monthly fees. you could do like me and set up your &quot;router as a wap&quot; (see google) and connect a lan port on the first router to the lan port of the second router to get your own wifi. wifi gets clogged up fast so why not your own? bob
if both routers were having all their ports used, would this be an easy/correct setup? isps modem &gt; uplink port of wired router &gt; port 1 and port 2 of wired router to uplink ports for the two wireless routers?
i would not do that setup. but as you thought it through what will happen, why not? that is, any setup you want can be done if you want it to. but here i go with setups we use and support. i don't see how that setup would be easy. bob
