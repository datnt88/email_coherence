i have a great mobo on the way but what cpu should i get? is an overclocked e8500 better than the q6600?
any cpu speed rating that's not oc'ed is stable, once oc'ed you're pushing it. if you're buying a cpu to oc, then you assume all risk. multiple core cpus tend to work well and they needn't be speed demons even if they can be oc'ed. as for your ?, buy what you feel suits you. i exclude oc needs. i suggest any cpu you get should be easily supported by your mtrbd. as for the mtrbd., if oc'ing in mind that it is also oc friendly. tada -----willy
is to run it at stock settings for stability. those that overclock do so at their own risk and choice. for me i'd get the one that is faster natively and fits my budget. bob
