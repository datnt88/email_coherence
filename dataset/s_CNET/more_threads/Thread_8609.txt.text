hey guys i'm new to site, i'm so glad i found somewhere in which i can express myself and have others who can relate to my story.
this type of forums are too good as well as helpful for us and we can get the help through this and its so useful
most of your posts are very unuseful. i've deleted a few for that reason, by the way. so could you please limit yourself to posting real help? kees
should post in another forum.?
if you need help, i've seen great (free) advice on issues in most of the cnet forums. if you want to spam, those posts vanish and can lead to a ban. bob
