recently the dvd/cdrw drive on my dell laptop went down. to save money, i bought an internal dvd burner(yamakawa dvr 7-08 8x dvd+/-rw (r888-1002 )) and a usb 2.0 enclosurer. i thought it should plug and play, but after i put everything together, the laptop(xp) did not recognize it as a dvd writer. the windows explorer did add a label to the dvd driver as &quot;dvd-r&quot;, but after i insert a blank dvd+r disk, the label changed to &quot;cd drive&quot;. i then tried the software(ezburning) came with dell, the software complained that it can not find any dvd writer divice. any help will be appreciated.
&quot; i then tried the software(ezburning) came with dell, the software complained that it can not find any dvd writer divice. &quot; while you missed one item on your post, the make/model of the laptop my bet is the ezburning software is locked to the make/model of the drive that came with the dell. if you just need data dvd recording, try what i use -&gt;  in closing, my external wasn't that stable until xp sp2 bob
man, you are good. i download the software you mentioned, it does locate the dvd writer, it even name the label as its brand name. thank you very much.
be sure to check the cdburnerxp site for updates. there's one feature missing in that software, but for 99% of the time it's all i need. bob
