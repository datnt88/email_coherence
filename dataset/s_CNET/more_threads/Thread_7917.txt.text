hi. i want to set-up a hotspot for guests/customers to use for internet access only. what equipment do i need to achieve this end result while keeping my network secure?
as there are so many today, i'll stop here.
goes way overboard with six guest networks.
yes, i have a router with a guest ssid, but it requires a login which i'd prefer to avoid. i'd like to make the public access as simple as possible. thanks for responding!
but putting out a little sign about the network name and password is simple. i prefer such because of what we can do with a rogue hotspot. here's some reading.  such an open network is a bad idea. i can't guess why anyone does this unless they didn't know. let's say you do put up an open wifi spot and it's called (ssid) freewifi. let's say i get near your office with my pineapple and do what the article portends. now will the folk that use your free wifi be upset with you over what i did? bob
