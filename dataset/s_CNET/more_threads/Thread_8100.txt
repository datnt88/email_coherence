5631	7	380395	3238396	3237289	willy	2/2/10 7:48 pm	1.26514008e12	i suggest....	if you're saying the ext. backup disk is already corrupted, then reformat. use win7 own format routine and be ntfs type, provided of course whatever data is now coming from the working system. once done, use win7 own backup pgm. for such. unless, you have other capable back-up(vendor provided) and win7 ready, do what you feel seems ok. last, whenever using the ext. hd be sure to actually dismount it via the s/w, once it says done, then unplug it. if you want to save the current data, then google for &quot;recovery s/w&quot;, i believe the sticky post here as links as well, check it. tada -----willy
5631	8	380395	3238763	3238396	redryder12	2/3/10 8:56 am	1.26518736e12	i suggest	here's what i've found.i may have it correctly backed up. i went to &quot;computer&quot;. my libraries and drives are in left pane. i click my external drive and properties. it tells me that i have 72gbs on the drive. that sounds about right for the things i backed up. it has 2 items listed in right pane. under &quot;raypc&quot;,properties,it lists the gbs and other information about changes that i can make.the other item on the list is mediaid, which i assume is my personal information. it opens in word pad. there i find some letters and numbers that i can't tell anything about. so, i guess i have the data on the external drive. is there anything else that i need to do,like make a special folder for it? i have it set to back up once a week, sunday, so i'll see if it automatic backs up. any other information that i might need would be appreciated. thanks for the help red
