a compaq presario had it's hard drive removed and it was cabled to a pc using a notebook ide 2/5&quot; usb adapter. after cabling to the pc via the usb port, the pc did not see the notebook hard drive. the operating system on the pc is xp home edition. the notebook hard drive also has xp hoome on it. the pc's mother board is an asus ( home made pc). why won't the pc see the hard drive?
starter ideas are motherboard drivers, usb 1.1 ports and drive letters hidden from explorer. your post is weak on details so to list all the reasons is not happening.
please clarify. did you mean ide's?
i have to decline listing the dozens of possible issues since that's something i just won't do. help others help you by heeding the words in red and testing your drive on another pc. be sure to try the rear usb port since some front ports have issues.
