i have an epson workforce 600, which i like very much, but i suddenly have a problem. i can't print anything off of the internet. i can print normal email and documents that i've saved. i tried to print airline confirmation that came with my email message, and all i got was blank pages that rolled through the printer. i just attempted to print some movie theater info off the internet, and the same thing happened. i can't find any information in my epson booklet about this kind of problem. i just downloaded a new driver, but that didn't help. can someone please help me?
turns out the problem isn't my printer, it's my browser. printer works fine with internet explorer but not with firefox. is there a forum for browsers?
check the firefox setting and enable/disable what maybe interfering. you can also look into any &quot;add-ons&quot; if you use them as well. if definitely the browser, then delete it and reload it again, but save your favorites for later return. if you like try a &quot;restore point&quot; to to a date before the problem. if that works and later it doesn't, then some update maybe at work here. i exclude any system issues. fyi- i have firefox and it works printing whatever i deem necessary. this is going to be one of those problems that someone reports on and us firefox users point to a fix or you have something unique to you. tada -----willy
thank you, willy. it's definitely the browser, so i think i'll uninstall it and try again.
after reading all the comments everywhere on the net, uninstalling firefox and reinstalling, nothing worked. (like you, it worked on ie). apparently the cause was a ms update. i just right-clicked the printer in the printers and devices folder and removed the printer (with the printer off). then i turned the printer on. the drivers were automatically installed and voila! everything worked.
