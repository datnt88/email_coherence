hi, i have to reinstall my windows xp, before y download all to a external drive (from a friend). but by mistake i reloaded with now mostly useless files my hard drive. is there a way to recognize which files are been used and which to get rid? if possible, if there is a way to delete them not one by one will be grate. thank for your attention to my question and your knowledge and suggestions. luis lesur from mexico
maybe a fresh install one more time?
thans for your reply, i had thougt of that, but to go again through all that process will be so time consuming (making againg a backup and reinstaling and configurating them will is something that i am not looking forward) but thank for your quick and kindly answer. regards from mexico luis lesur
