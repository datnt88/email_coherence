i have two computers, both with wireless adapters, a 11mbps linksys, and a 54mbps d-link. it seems that they will not function very well when both of them are in operation, with frequent signal drops. when i use only one of them, there are no problems. what could be the problem?
to sort it out, i had to update firmware and drivers all around. have you?
i didn't think of updating firmware at all, gonna go check now
i'm writing about the firmware in the router. -&gt; when posting, name names, makes, models, versions so others can chime in about such. you may be shortchanging yourself of someone that's been there with your make/models/versions. bob
