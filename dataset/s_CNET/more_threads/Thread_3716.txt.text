the samsung 17 inch lcd monitor, 710n-2-black is selling for such low prices [at newegg and others] 309 minus 30 mail in and minus 40 immediate rebate = 239 incl shipping. this is a 12 millisecond model. i heard that some of the faster ones didn't match up when it came to color quality. do you think that samsung is unloading them?????
i saw newegg promoting it just earlier this morning as well. i bet samsung is definitely trying to unload them.
i purchased the samsung 710n-2 from zipzoomfly and received an older model &quot;samsung 710n&quot; (no -2)and the box came without any upc code for rebate. i am currently in the middle of trying to rectify this situation with zipzoomfly/samsung. beware of dealing with them as you may end up with something you did not want!
