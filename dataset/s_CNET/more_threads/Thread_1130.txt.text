hi all i am running windows xp pro and just install 200gb hard drive as a slave however, after i format the drive i only get 127 gb out of it, is there any way i can get the max 200 gb out of this drive? i use a 80gb as master, anyone with an idea could please e-mail me at winperry@hotmail.com thanks much
you need a pci contoller card to get your computer to recongnize the 200gb hard drive
to go past that, you need sp1 (sp2 preferred) and a bios that supports 48bit lba. more at  since you have just xp pro and no sp1 or sp2, a pci card will not fix this. bob
i just went through this, i installed a 200gb seagate as drive d: and kept os on drive c: (80gb)on xp. the new drive intructions had me go online and download a file that made xp see past 127gb.
