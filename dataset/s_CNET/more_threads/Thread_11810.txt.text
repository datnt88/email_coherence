okay, a totally newbie type question...i just purchased a netgear wpn824 router. my wife wantd to bring her mac laptop home occasionally from work. do i install the cd and follow the set up instructions on our hard wired desk top...or into the laptop to begin the set up?...or both? thanks, jd
always set up a wireless router through a wired computer. i just last week set up that exact router for my daughter. the cd will walk you through nicely,but go to the cnet sticky first. these guys have helped me dozens of times and really know what they are talking about. here is a link:
thanks jbeck...just got home from dinner. read the sticky, followed the cd, and presto... i was a little worried after reading all the problems some people were having but it couldn't have been easier. thanks again jd
