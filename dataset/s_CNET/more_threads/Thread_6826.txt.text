it could be the problem of blocked nozzle - do a nozzle check pattern, it should look something like this:  if not, try this first:  hope this helps.
sorry to say i have the same problem with an epson stylus color 880 ever since it sucked in two sheets of heavy glossy photo paper at one time. had a tough time removing them. i suspect that damaged the nozzles. changing cartridges did not help. unlike some other mfg printers, the epson nozzles are not part of the cartridge. i tried everything you did & everything the epson help desk suggested except taking it to one of their repair stations.
