my 802.11g connection on my toshiba a-35 notebook (xp) allows me to drink beer in my back yard and surf the internet as it communicates with my 802.11b linksys wireless 4-port router that provides cable modem access. but now, i want the same mobility that will allow me to sit on the beach at galveston; or sit on the river bank in big bend nat'l park; or as a passenger in a car driving to dallas; and i want broadband fast connectivity. is this possible yet? details....?
remember that 2.4gbz is that same frequency range as your microwave oven. now a little issue of how to double the coverage of a radio signal. you need 4 times the power for each doubling of the distance. starting at only 200 milliwatts for your best wifi wireless access point (wap) as a baseline, we can figure what it takes to reach out to you at 100 miles away. let's peg that full speed 802.11a at 11 megabits to work super at 41.25 feet and see what watts we need at 1 mile? ok bpbasic ready&gt; 64000 bytes free 41.25 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 5280 feet. 0.2w * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 25.6 watts end bpbasic now if we want to go from 1 mile to 20 miles we just keep going. 2 miles = 51.2 watts 4 miles = 102.4 watts 8 miles = 204.8 watts 16 miles = 409.6 watts 32 miles = 819.2 watts yes, we have about the power of your average household microwave oven at 20 miles. not only do we need this much power in the wap, but about that much in you lap pc-card. looks like wifi in your card will have some problems. bob
what a bummer, mr. moderator. so what's the answer? vacationing last week in hawaii, there were &quot;hot spots&quot; in most of the local coffee houses that would give you a password for about $10 per day. being the cheapskates that we are, we opted for dial-up access (56k), which felt like reverting back to the 50's because it was so slow. but i've heard of &quot;access&quot; thru your cellular phone, also &quot;satellite&quot; service (for the mobile computer-guy). what's the story? are there any holy grails out there that are functional?

did you ever find a solution to your question? i have the same questions. does anyone out there know of ways to have a laptop get internet access in a park or on a lake or in a car? the cell co's are expensive and need monthly service plans, and what if you're not near their towers? do they &quot;roam&quot; like a cell phone and use other co's towers? what about a satellite company like he asks about. anyone know who the &quot;satellite&quot; companies are? (not for putting a dish in home/office, but for when outside or travelling!) thanks!
in the past we had richochet (modems) and in some places you can pick up wifi such as a local bookstore for free. in the future we have wimax, but all this takes time unless you are lucky to have the richochet up in your area. bob
