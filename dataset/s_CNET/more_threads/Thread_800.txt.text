i need help with hl-dt-st rw/dvd gcc-4242n combo drive.i just got a trouble with my drive. it worked fine. then i installed pes 6 (a pc game), and my cdrom didnt work anymore. its icon hasnt appeared in my computer. i tried to uninstall pes 6, but it still didnt work. lately, i found out that my cdrom driver was corrupted or something like that. does anyone know how to fix that problem. or where can i find the driver for my combo drive.i need to use it urgently.thanks p/s: i asked a guy about it.he said it might be cause by starforce protection ( this game software protection) or any similar protection.but he doesnt know how to fix it.
look up remove upperfilters lowerfilters on google.com and you'll find the usual xp fix. but i don't know if that's the os in use. also, be sure to try another drive since they die often. bob
thanks buddy. my drive has started running properly again.cheers
