is it possible to simply disconnect a monitor from one computer, and hook it up to another without shutting the currect computer down? is simply shutting the monitor off sufficient? ~dave
not a good idea to disconnect a device while current is flowing, although i have removed monitor plugs inadvertantly and reconnected without occurence. a better solution to split a monitors usage between two computers would be a kvm switch.
great idea. i googled kvm and got some pretty nice all-in-one switch with cables under $30. thanks. ~dave
