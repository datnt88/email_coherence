should i turn off my computer before plugging in the subwoofer? have an hp pavilion a340n 180 gigs, thanks
we'd need more information to answer your question but in general you want any form of output/source off before connecting speakers
turn it off!
thank you for your response. that's sort of what i figured i should do. am fairly familiar with computers. and just needed to be reassured. thank you.
