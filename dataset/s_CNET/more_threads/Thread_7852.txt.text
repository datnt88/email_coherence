hi all. i'm having problems accessing the configuration utility of the *second* router in my daisy chain. here's my setup. i have one router (router 1) on ground floor which gets internet from the modem. that router is then plugged into the lan port of a wireless router upstairs (router 2). my laptop is then plugged into another lan port on router 2. this allows me internet access as intended. but i'd like to log into the the configuration utility of router 2. but when i type the ip address of router 2 into my browser (192.168.1.1), it takes me to the configuration utility of router 1. router 2 is out of the box--i haven't done any configuration to it (for example, changing its static ip address). thanks in advance for any help.
the story is incomplete or i missed where the second router's wan port is unused. google how to use a router as a wap to find out how i get this to work. bob
yes, the wan port on router 2 is unused. router 1 is connected to one of the lan ports on router 2. this is how various articles described this setup, and it works. to be precise, the articles also said that i had to set the ip address of router 2 to something outside router 1's range, and i had to disable dhcp management on router 2. i did not do either of those, and everything works. i won't worry about it until i encounter problems. anyway i solved my problem. like a bonehead, i had the lan connection disabled on my computer. when i re-enabled it, i was then able to log in to router 2 and configure it.
