outside input would be greatly appriciated at this point, i have 2 desktops, comp. 1-high power gsky link usb adaptor and a lb-link wireless g pci card, comp. 2- netgear high performance dual band usb adaptor and a microsoft broadband pci card. with comp. 1 im able to pick up several networks and decent connections with the usb adaptor. comp 2 usb adaptor picks up several networks but very weak never connecting. i have tried every possible thing i could think of to get comp 2 connected to any network several many ways and all ive managed to do is completley confuse myself.
i rarely care about other networks. i usually setup our own network. also, i always set it up within 20 feet to the wifi router the first time. you seem to not have a router? bob
yeah bob, i'm thinking he's just hitting hot spots and trying to hook up...see nothing of a real network.
when hotspots first sprang up, i remember seeing desktops folks would wheel around in carts. today, haven't seen that. guess folk have moved on. bob
i have heard of the cart thing but have never seen it myself, too funny.
