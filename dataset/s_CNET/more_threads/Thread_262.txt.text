hp pavillion 540n power supply fan is (intermittent) noisy (high pitch resonance) what can we do about it ? leo
buy a replacement power supply, that's really the only option normally available in these cases.
if its just dirty clean fan, ive done that find a mom pop shop get a bad power supply replace fan
replace the fan, of course. however, replacing the fan maybe 1/2 of the problem as prolonged operation of an intermit fan causes &quot;stress&quot; on the p/s componets and there's a 50/50 chance it will fail entirely. while, the replacing the fan makes sense, replacing the p/s is a more practical solution besides a new p/s plus the included fan, you have a chance to increase the wattage of p/s if available. the choice is yours. the fan size is usually 80 or 90mm in size or 3-4in.. good luck -----willy
i have a hp pavillion 8700 also with a noisy fan. you talked of a powersupply fan. is there more than one fan inside?
it sounds like your power supply fan is just beginning to go. if you replace it now now chances are your power supply is fine because the rpms on the fan haven't dropped too much.
there is only one fan, but trying to find a replacement and putting one in can be more trouble than just replacing the powersupply.
