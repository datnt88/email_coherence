hi i'm looking to get a new desktop after 8 years and i've come across this acer  is this a good buy?
you may want to ask for a credit for that and let them keep it. bob
i might do some casual gaming and video editing, so that video card should be sufficient. what do you think of the overall price though? it does come with a 22&quot; lcd.
i like the cpu, ram, etc. 99.99% of users that get such will be just fine. those gamers however will want a step up on the video card. bob
