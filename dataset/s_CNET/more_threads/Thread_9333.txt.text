hi there, we just open a little marketing acgency and we are looking for a good printer (laser) that make beautiful image for marketing project for our customers. price rnage between 0 to 1500. -low cost per page - ppm up 30 -don't need fax it's moslty all about color and images. we want very good quality. if someone had an idea it will really help us to find out!
i've been in such an office and they learned the hard way that you use a pre-press print of your work on the common inkjet then done to the print shop for the high volume high quality prints. your post leads me to believe you haven't learned or done this yet. bob
you're right, and we are all students. it's a project we're doing, but not a school project, a business project and we need a printer, we don't know which one or if it's possible to get one for what we wnat to do! charles
the best printer for this is 5 or more figures. the office lessons are something i can share but it appears that folk insist on repeating the lesson. if you want to try getting your own printer, why not head to the store and look at print samples? bob
we think the best we can do is to deal with a printing company. they have the material, we do the marketing project and we can save up money and gain benefits. i apologize for my rough english, i'm a french-canadian haha. i really appreciate your help. it helps me to ask the right question. thank you
i lived in vancouver bc for many years and that was another office where we would do on screen pre-press work then a test print off the current ink jets of the day then off to the print shop for a print that we would check before the final run. today there are many good shops and it pays to read as much as you can about prepress work. here's a tutorial that's less than a sip from the firehose. -&gt;
