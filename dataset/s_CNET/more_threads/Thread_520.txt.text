i recently got my computer fix because of some virus that did something to the explorer.exe. and since i've got it back the sound coming out of my speakers sounds echoey?
depending on your audio chipset, you may have &quot;effect&quot; output. meaning, you can change how the audio is produced like in a cave, auditorum, stage, etc.. you need you check the audio(multi-media) portion and see what if any changes can be made. you will know if that's possible, chancge it and save upon exiting that area. this should be found under the control panel area. mine is for the ac'97. it could be another problem area, but that's where i check first. you can also verify under the device setting what the outputs are set at, like xyz??? device. tada -----willy
i have the same chip as you the ac97 and i've had a look and have found nothing that can change the effect?
ok, now is the time you explain, exactly what system you have. i'm not going to be guessing. if you run xp, then you have an icon under control panel that's labeled, &quot;sound effect manager&quot;. if none, you have what? tada -----willy
i found it, the setting was under ''generic''. which i have now changed to ''none''. thanks willy.
