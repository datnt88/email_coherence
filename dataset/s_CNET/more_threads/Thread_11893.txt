7989	3	123111	1396068	1395998	r. proffitt	9/1/05 6:35 am	1.1255565e12	the forum asked 2 times so far.	the forum asks so responders don't have to ask. the forum asked: &quot;note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.&quot; i will not ask every time since it's up to you to participate in fixing your issue. bob

7989	5	123111	1397095	1396912	r. proffitt	9/1/05 5:25 pm	1.1255955e12	why are you not revealing the information?	for instance i see such an error reported with a btc dvd recorder, but you didn't respond to the forum note with make and model of all the parts. this is not tech support. this is a place where we team up on your issue. if you don't want to share then this is very rough. if you don't know what you have, just say so. many learn about belarc advisor so they can help themselves. bob
