hello, i have been trying to play games like call of duty 2 and doom 3 and they run really slow and choppy. i took this system requirements test and my graphics card was the only thing that failed the test. so my question is if i want to upgrade a graphics card, can i just upgrade to any graphics card or does it matter what my pc specs are? i have a pentium 4, 3.06 ghz, 896 ram, 146 gb hard drive, ati radeon express 200, and i have a pci express slot.
get a card with as much ram as you can afford, and make sure it'll fit/is designed for pci express. do you have an agp slot? if so, maybe a better choice.
but just because it has more doesn't mean it's better. the memory interface is just as important if not more. for example my system came with a 7300le turbocache card listed as 256mb. it was configured to use 512mb.64bit memory interface. most half decent cards now are true 256mb cards with a 128bit memory interface. the higher-end cards are 256mb+ with 256bit+ memory interfaces.
