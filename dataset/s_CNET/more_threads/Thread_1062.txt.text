i need help..i have an hp office jetj6480 all in one...if i can get 50 black and white copies and 20 color copies before the ink runs out i am lucky. i have had this since last december and have gone through 7 sets of ink . i am looking for a new printer that yields a large number of copies, the printer is less than $100 and the refills are not rediculous. i hope someone can help me i am sick of wasting so much money
getting an plain old copier for the black/white copies? it's about as cheap as it can get.
i have an hp officejet 4500 desktop. i just started using it recently and had to purchase ink right away. after buying a new cartridge, again it ran out after printing approx 20 black &amp; white pages. i thought the cartridge was defected and returned it. i have since bought 3 more and all have been the same!!!! there is nothing wrong with the ink, it is the hp printer . it uses way way to much ink. i just replaced it yesterday and printed only 15 pages and it is already out again......what printer do i need to buy??? i need one that gives me top quality printing without costing a fortune.
sounds defective. get to hp.com and arrange for warranty or just return it.
