hi all, we have several walkabout hammerhead hh3 tablet pc's. they are at the age now that they won't hold the cmos settings. the company says that they are the only ones who can replace the battery/cmos chip, and of course rather expensive. i have completely dismantled one and i can't find anything resembling a battery. i thought they might be using a cap but the one i see that is in the package i would expect is being used to filter the backlight. i have looked under battery, behind pcmcia slot, all around the screen and i am stumped. any help would be appreciated.
since there is no manual available try this link.  since they have 24 of them they may know something. don't be cheap. pay them for the answer. bob
i appreciate your help and comments, keep them coming.
hello. have you looked for a small black square box on the mainboard? it is an integrated real time clock / battery used on some motherboards. an example is one that has the brand dallas semiconductors and has a drawing of a clock on it. i am surprised the cmos battery is depleted on a recent tablet like the hh3.
thank you, i have looked for that as well and unless the package has change since the last one i replaced. thanks and keep em coming guys and gals this is a stumper for me.
the cmos battery is located on the motherboard. this is the last board that can be removed from the unit. it is the one with the ram chips on it. the battery is on the bottom of the board. the battery is a panasonic br2330. digi-key part number p025-nd.
