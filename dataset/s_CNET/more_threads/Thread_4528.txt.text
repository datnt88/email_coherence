hi, i'm looking to add a hard drive to my dimension 4700. however, i don't know what kind of connections are necessary, or even what brand of hard drive to buy. i know i have another bracket in my pc, i just don't know what kind of connectors to use. my budget is $100. any recommendations? system specs: pentium 4 2.80 ghz 1.5 gb ram (2x 512mb and 2x 256mb) 80 gb hard drive (came with pc) sapphire radeon x850 gto 256 mb pci express x16 gpu 550w dual fan logysis power supply
goto to dell and allow them to check your &quot;system status&quot; for an upgrade. more than likely you need an ide type hd. many are on sale or online starting in the 120gb or more range. it a real drop-in upgrade and make sure it has the help guide with purchase or get online at the hd makers support website. go there now bwforwhand and look into what you're getting in to. plus, at dell support they shoul also explain the process to add a 2nd hd to the system, though it maybe generic in nature it covers the topic well. tada -----willy
thanks. i checked dell support, this was all the info they were able to give me: storage drive type drive size total available space used space c: ntfs 70.70gb 12.40gb 58.30gb and disk drives wdc wd800jd-75jnc0 74.50gb i know it says i have 12 gigs left, but that's only because i've maxed out my ipod's storage space with all of my video files. is there any site that would tell me the specs that my dell supports? from there i can just copy and paste the specs into newegg or something.
disk drives wdc wd800jd-75jnc0 74.50gb \\\\\\\\\\\\\\ take the above info and visit the western digital hd support website and look-up that model hd. the specs are freely given. you then buy a similar type hd, there are two types, eide or sata. don't be confused by the terms that maybe thrown at you, its just those two, period, excluding capacity, buffering, and/or speed.  tada -----willy
it's a serial ata hard drive, 1.5 gb/s serial interface. thank you very much.
