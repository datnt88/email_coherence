4343	2	347523	3069212	3069186	ffsammy	6/27/09 8:33 am	1.24609158e12	yes	yes i tried that and it still will not work, any other ideals? do you think i need to replace.
4343	3	347523	3069215	3069212	kees bakker	6/27/09 8:36 am	1.24609176e12	yes?	when bob wrote &quot;swap the drive out&quot; he meant &quot;replace&quot;. so it's: no, i didn't yet. better do. kees

4343	6	347523	3069403	3069373	deniceels	6/27/09 1:26 pm	1.24610916e12	yes in this	case as even a 1 year old burner can still fail to burn after that, that is unless you have another spare one lying around to test it out. factors includes heavy usage, type of disc used, production fault for some examples.
4343	7	347523	3069590	3069403	ffsammy	6/27/09 7:36 pm	1.24613136e12	thank you	want to thank all of you will stay away from dell if this is the problem, you guys are great.

4343	9	347523	3069737	3069694	deniceels	6/28/09 7:31 am	1.24617426e12	possiblity	of being unfortunate batch received. similar to mobile phones in which not all batches are produced with same longivety, and odd ones will slip out. quality checks are also randomly selected, thus, it may have een missed. one won't go checking all million of manufactured ones as it will take ages to complete. likewise, like some previous battery recalls, some of those with faults have been shipped out, and although not all of the same batches may be affected. i have unfortunate experience before with such stuffs and this is despite my friend have the same stuff from the same batch, his was ok and vice versa. so, yup, that's why i mentioned it as possibility.
4343	10	347523	3069780	3069737	r. proffitt	6/28/09 8:51 am	1.24617906e12	or just like all dvdrw drives.	the drive to get the costs down to lowest possible has resulted in drives that last about a year or two. i think you expected 5 years of use. bob
4343	11	347523	3069848	3069780	ffsammy	6/28/09 11:09 am	1.24618734e12	dvd read/write	i expected to have a drive that at the very least lasted 3 yrs. but yea you are right, just have to watch out. i have had problems with this company before.
4343	12	347523	3069861	3069848	r. proffitt	6/28/09 11:33 am	1.24618878e12	sorry if i was unclear.	with these dvdrw drives hitting 20 bucks they last 1 or 2 years under &quot;use.&quot; dell has no exclusive on these failures. you should see them on all make machines. at least we are talking under 40 for most desktops. bob
