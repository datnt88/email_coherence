ok, so i'm really blond today. i'm sitting here looking at two speakers and a subwoofer and am clueless what connects to what. any help appreciated. the subwoofer has 4 inputs. line 1 (in/out) line 2 (l/r) the main speaker has 5 inputs. input 1 input 2 to left speaker output dc the remaining speaker has 1 input. to right speaker. i'm assuming one of these plugs will go to the sound input on the back of my pc. any help appreciated. i understand the dc on the back of the one speaker and the power plug on the back of the subwoofer. this is a yamaha yst msw10 set, and my pc is a dell dimension with windows xp.
...shows diagrams, plugs, and all connections. make sure you have adobe acrobat reader (  )installed before using this link :  seems easier to understand with pictures! good luck, geebee.
thank you much! and most definately...pictures are great! :-)i searched google on the model number and i went to the yamaha page...but came up with nuthin'. appreciate the help. maybe i'll be jamming shortly. really want to try to hook up this altec 250 watts surround sound, but tired right now of splicing speaker wire that i needed. will get to it another night. but need sound now for a project. thanks again!
