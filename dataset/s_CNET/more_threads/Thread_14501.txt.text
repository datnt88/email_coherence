what are the signs of needing a new dvd r/rw drive emachines t5026 pentium 4 3.06 cpu 768 ram windows xp home 160 hard drive basically i have the factory system the same way when i bought it from best buy.
are you having any? feel free to share.
if you want one, then get one. if you *need* one, by all means install one. it's really up to you if no problems are present now. tada -----willy
i don't think i have any problems, my dvds burn and play pretty good. i was just thought that after a year of heavy burning(dvd and cd) the burner would be dead but it seems okay. i did some research on the brand name of the drive-tsst corp. which is a joint venture between toshiba and samsung. the last firmware upgrade i got maybe fall of 2005, and none since. this is why i think maybe i should get a new burner, because they've stop giving updates, meaning that my burner is outdated. maybe i'm over reacting, i guess if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
even if you got a new dvd burner, it may need an update so don't sweat it if no updates are available for you're current burner. &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; is alot of common sense. you have the option to replace in the future, cross-fingers good or bad. tada -----willy
