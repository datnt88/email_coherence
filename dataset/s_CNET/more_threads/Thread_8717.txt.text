hi, trying to print a stack of &quot;no. 6 3/4&quot; envelopes with my business return address. it works great feeding them one at a time through the mp tray, but when i put a stack in the regulat tray, 75% come out printed crooked. i have the side guides snugged down. the nice guy at canon hemmed and hawed and basically said my machine may have a problem, then said that model wasn't really designed for that...what the? anyone have luck printing more than one envelope at a time on a canon multi functon laser d480?
the rollers get a little slick so here's the deal. 1. new? call it in, get it fixed. 2. old? call it in, get a quote. bob
that's right. still would like to know the machine's age.
sorry i didn't mention it. seems like it should be able to handle something like this longer than that, especially since the mp slot works just fine.
i had one fellow raving about a 2 degree slant. at 6 months it's in warranty. if the product says it prints on envelopes and if you are giving a few degrees of latitude then call it defective and stand your ground. bob
