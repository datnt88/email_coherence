i have 500gb external hard drive. i am using it for vedio recording. suddenly that hard drive now shows size of 111gb only. it used to save recording for 15 days it comes only to 5 days. any help or suggestion to get my lost bytes back. i have windows xp installed.
for example if someone plugged it into windows xp (notice no sp?) then that's what xp would report. in fact it could corrupt the drive. fix? plug into a system with an os that supports over 127gb drives and start over. bob
i had that hard drive with same pc. it was 500gb at the time it was installed. just recently i noticed it is not 500gb anymore...do you suggest me to upgarde software with sp2?
read  for more details and keep an eye out on what limits us to 127gb. one of them is &quot;xp.&quot;
