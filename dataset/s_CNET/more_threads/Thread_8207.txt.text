i have just built my own computer & it keeps saying boot disk error enter system disk & press enter no matter what i put in the cd drive it keeps coming up with the same message & i'm lost for what to do please help
did u change the boot order in the bios setup to first check the cd-rom? i assume u have a brand new hard drive, so u'll need to format and partition it before installing the os.
take a look at the 'advanced chipset features' in the bios, is the cd-rom drive listed, and the hard drive? also it would help to have a few details of your set up. phantazy
i have the cd drive as the first boot drive then the hard drive and then the floppy. how would i go about formating and partion a new hard drive on a brand new computer build?
or at least a setup/formatting program from the drive manufacturer. the os, say xp, comes on a cd that is bootable and most of the time the cd is placed in the cdrom drive and away you go. try posting here for more and better help at cnet's computer newbies forum. hope this helps.
