i just purchased a new dell pc which runs windows vista. i would like to connect the harddrive from my previous pc (running xp) to the harddrive for my new pc (running vista). after connecting the harddrives, how would i go about formatting the secondary harddrive? do i simply right-click the drives that appear and click format? after formatting, how do i partition new drives for the harddrive? thank you. any help will be greatly appreciated.
start settings control panel administrative tools computer management disk management right click on the newly added drive....select delete partitions or format depending on what you want to do. let us know. vapcmd
thanks for the help. i'll let you know once i connect them. by the way, if i don't format the secondary harddrive can i use it to multi-boot to vista or xp?
thru the bios. i'm sure there's multi-boot sw you could use to do it too vapcmd
