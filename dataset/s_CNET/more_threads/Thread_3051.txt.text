i have tried all the freeware available, i entered my wpa a month ago and i didnt write it down. i also dont have access to the router. any way to find the cookie and extract the password thanks
this is why we love wpa-psk! if you lose the password just ask the router's owner for the new one. bob
do you remember the password that generated the key? if so then you can generate it again or have someone do it on same type router.
