i'm running a hp pavilion g6 laptop windown 7 linksys wrt54gs router windstream speedstream modem lately my laptop won't go online with wifi. it says, &quot;no internet access.&quot; this is confusing, because i can hard wire it to my modem and it works okay, so it is not the isp. but, we have another computer and sometimes it will work on there, and we have a roku and it works on there sometimes. so, this is not consistant. today i went to linksys and downloaded the latest firmware update and installed that. i still have the same problem. --- &quot;no internet access.&quot; any suggestions? thanks, i'm going bananas!
if the router is set to wep, that happens a lot. i no longer will discuss why that is. try wpa or wpa2 next. bob
so, that isn't the problem. however, this afternoon when i felt really desperate i found the cd that came with the router and ran it to set it up again. at first it didn't work, then i ran the troubleshooting part and after a few things it began to work again. i'm so happy right now you wouldn't believe it. i've spent all day on this stupid thing. so, thanks for your help, and if i get stuck again i'll be back. blessings.
any mac filtering? i can't guess all that it could be, so we start with the most common and hope there are more clues. bob
