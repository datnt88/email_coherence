i have a hard wired four computer network that needs help. the main computer ie the one that has all the files and printers, keeps dropping off the network. i boot the machine and all file and printer sharing is fine. after a period of time, 1 to 4 hours, file and printer sharing are no longer available to the other machines on the network. i have disabled the firewall on the machine but that has had no effect. all machines on the network can get to the internet and the main machine can see files on the other machines. yesterday i was working in an application and the connection dropped while entering data. not a good thing. thanks for your assistance. tam cn5@aol.com
a good place to start is looking at the system/app event logs. especially when the connection was lost. another step would be to look at the nic to see whether the led's blink plus check the port the pc is plugged into on your switch/router. when the pc goes offline, is there any activity? also, does changing the port effect the dropouts?
i have changed my settings on my computers and this way the computer no longers shuts down the ubs ports. go to device manager(right click my computer, left click properties, left click hardware, left click device manager) go to the usb controller section and click the + sign. go to each usb root hub and right click on it, left click properties, left click power management. uncheck the box, allow computer to turn off this device to save power. rick
