hello! i have a custom pc i built a while back, and i have noticed some games do not run as good as they should be with the part i am using. i have done a benchmark, and the only component that is slower than normal is the cpu. passmark performance test's website says an intel c2q q8400 gives an average of 3,680 cpu marks. mine only gets 2800-2900. here are the relevant specs: motherboard: xfx nforce 750i os: windows 7 (sp1) 32bit memory: 2.50 gigs ddr2 ram @ 800mhz cpu: intel(r) core(tm)2 quad cpu q8400 @ 2.66ghz video card: asus nvidia geforce gtx 460 768 mb psu: thermaltake 600watt other thoughts: a while back, my system was worse and only ran at 667 mhz fsb by default but i finally changed that to 800 a month ago. it improved performance some. (from 2600 marks to 2800) in passmark performance test, it reads my cpu speed as 2.044ghz, it should read somewhere around 2.667 ghz  my computer runs perfectly fine (other than im not getting the gaming performance i should be) its a fast, modern computer runs windows 7 beautifully and never hangs. it plays portal 2, cod4, fallout 3, and l4d at around 60 fps or higher, maxed settings at 1920x1080 (thanks to the video card) several other games give me much lower framerates, even at the lowest possible resolutions and settings such as nfs shift (20), dirt 2 (27), and crysis demo (25) i gather from this it is a insufficiency in cpu performance that is the cause. i know i should be getting better results from my processor, what can i do to make it run like it should?
hmm, my hp d4999t is on 64 bit 7 and is very nice. but i opted for 64 bit so i don't cramp the os and drivers into the 32 bit space plus i know to install the intel rapid app. there could be other factors such as the maker's choice or slow ram but since i own a few quad cores i thought i'd share. bob
going to your bios, and disable eist/speedstep, and c1e state. this stops the system from automatically changing the multiplier ...rerun the test and see what results you get. let us know. vapcmd
i disabled eist, but i didn't find c1e. somehow... it performed worse on the benchmark than with it enabled. i retested it with both settings a few times to make sure. cpuz shows my proccesor at normal stats. 333x8 2.66ghz, but passmark's &quot;measured cpu speed&quot; is always on the low side (and it varies every time i open it) the only other cpu settings i could find in the bios are: cpu function -&gt; execute bit support (disabled), set cpuid maxval to 3 (disabled) i'm not sure what these mean but i will test them out
it could be the 32 bit os slowing it down... but would it really make such a difference? ill have to borrow a friend's 64 bit and see the difference. lol, i kind of have ram from all over the place. i have 2x 512 ocz, 1gb of kingston, and a 512 of.. uh something i know its all 800mhz though, and the startup hardware check thing says its in dual channel mode.ill try just using one stick and see how that goes
with that mismosh of ram i wonder if that's taking it down a notch. it certainly can't be dual channel even if it reports it is. sorry if i don't elaborate why but it's why i opted for simple 2x2gb sticks. bob
correctly. do you see that cpu speed info during boot and in the bios ? what results do you get under windows performance ? is the pc performing as expected other than the passmark test results ? vapcmd
cpu speed seems normal in bios windows performance shows a cpu score of 7.0 it performs great other a few, very demanding games. i'll try different benchmarks
