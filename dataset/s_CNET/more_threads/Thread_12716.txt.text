hello. i just replaced my comcast rental modem with a motorola sb6141. i called comcast to have them add it to my services. this worked fine, and i am able to connect a computer via ethernet to my new modem with no problem. however, when i go to connect a router to it i get no internet signal. are there any addition step(s) that i need to take to get my router to work? any help is greatly appreciated. thanks.
there's an option in most routers to clone the mac address. you might try that. i'm using the comcast modem these days, but for several years i used a motorola modem myself & never had a problem. i think i did set the router to clone the mac address fwiw. ` good luck.
thank you so much for your response. but i'm a little new to this; how exactly do i go about cloning the mac address? thanks again for your help.
usually there's a specific address you type into your browser like 192.168.xxx.yyy to access the router. once there you'll be prompted for the admin id and password. after signing in you'll get a menu of options that will be documented in the router's user guide. they differ from one make and model, so you'll just have to look and see where the option is, but it's usually not that hard to find - you can often just browse through the half dozen or so menus and stumble across it. ` good luck.
