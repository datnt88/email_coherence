look at all those! theres so many! but which one should i pick and why? why is the least expensive $185, and the most expensive $260?
...all affect the price. stock 8800gt cards run at 600mhz, others are factory overclocked to as much as 700mhz. btw, this the full newegg list (27 choices):  this is probably the best deal ($148 after rebate) since it comes with a game but the fan is somewhat loud:
one more question please sir, says i should buy ram heat sinks for the onboard ram... cant find the ram on the board. i see dvi ports, tv port, power in, zalman hsf, sli connector, 16x interface, and a row of capacitors, but i cannot identify the ram. its probably some of those black squares. which black squares are the ram? can i even buy a cover for grafix card ram?
nevermind, about that one last question sir (columbo reference) i decided to get this one:  since i hate rebates. plus, this one will not destroy itself if the fans die.
