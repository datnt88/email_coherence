my boss wants the files that are on his dead usb thumb drive. i told him i would ask some folks...... it it possible but costly, or is not possible? i've already investigated on memorex.com. many thanks for any help!
last hurrah is to find someone that really knows how to use: a. microscope. b. solder iron. have then touch up the connections and traces and see what happens. bob
bob - thanks. that's what i thought but i had to ask... he is a doctor and probably thinks that i should be able to pull a mcguyver and fix it with a paper clip and a post it. rachel
