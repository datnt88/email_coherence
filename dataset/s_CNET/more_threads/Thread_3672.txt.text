my computer was bought in about 2004 and only has 512mb of ram. it has 2 ports for ram sticks, but im not sure what size to put in to make it faster. it's a hp725n with a 80gb hdd, and 2 256mb ram sticks. also, its running xp home. i'm not sure on the motherboard type, but can anyone make a suggestion based on the age and type of cpu?
website ? vapcmd ps-it also helps to know the product series...i.e. pavilion and whether it's a desktop or laptop
go to crucial.com and run the memory test, it will tell you your stats and you can go from there.
