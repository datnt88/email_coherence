is 802.11a better? or is 802.11g better? if a is better, where can i get a router and stuff for that?
technology/ speed/ frequency 802.11b 11mbps 2.4ghz 802.11g 54mbps 2.4ghz 802.11a 54mbps 5 ghz if you own many items operating in that same frequency range, choose the other to avoid interference.
i looked it up online and it says that 802.11a has the lowest chance of other items interfering with it.
there are 8 usable channels with 802.11a. only 3 cannels with b/g. 5.0 gigahertz cordless phones can interfere with 802.11a. 802.11a equipment is usually more expensive. try looking online for routers that are a+g.
