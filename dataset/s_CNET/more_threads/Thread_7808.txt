7786	4	505161	5024572	5024516	dc_dk	11/11/10 1:43 pm	1.28948298e12	hi bob	well, i read it in some articles, here are the ones i have the adress on:   -the source to my consearns is actually from the supportpage on the x58 extreme6, the modules arent in the supported list!! how important is it to follow these guidances?? i have wrote to asrock, and am in the process of contacting kingston. just thought, maybe someone knew how 'hard' one should follow that ddr-compatibility list. (thanks for answering guys) dc
7786	5	505161	5024566	5024516	dc_dk	11/11/10 1:57 pm	1.28948382e12	correction:	the articles said something about that core i7's integrated memory-controller could get damaged beyond repair by memory-modules operating above 1.5v. almost all of the ddr3 triple-channel operate at 1.65v, but then i found these. havent had the time to try to figure out, whether there is a problem, or whether those sites(articles)are just amd-freaks bashing superior enemy architecture
7786	6	505161	5024604	5024450	dc_dk	11/11/10 3:02 pm	1.28948772e12	oups !!	just re-read those articles, and it seems i got it wrong: its apparently only a problem when going beyond 1.5-1.65v -so im going to return those kingston, cause they are too slow! but: does anyone know how much one should follow that ddr3-compatibility list for supported modules???
