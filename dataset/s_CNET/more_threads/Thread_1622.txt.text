i have a 2010 macbook pro computer that wirelessly connects to the internet via an apple time machine. i currently have an hp photosmart c7200 printer that i could never get to function wirelessly. is there any e-printers (multi function) scan and print that i could get to work wirelessly for all functions? thanks!
one of the things i like to do is just walk through the apple store. often i see a printer there and it's not wired in but on wifi. i bet you would want that printer. bob
i am using a lexmark prestige 805...
