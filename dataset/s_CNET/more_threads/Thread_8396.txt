1517	3	278610	2705820	2704753	dawg monitor	2/15/08 10:40 pm	1.2031152e12	i found out sadly...	inside there was something burn, not sure what(i havent looking much about lcd technology). thats what the repair man said and of course it will cost more than the monitor to repair so i just used my old 15&quot; and replace my other computer with my cousin's monitor. also, he mention it was cause by electricity problems so my parents bought surge arrest. over all, i suggest you buy another monitor and a surge protector(the power strip i had sucked).

(i am not smart in electronics etc)if you do fix monitors-how much would you charge and where do i send it? oh? since i have it opened can i send only the boards? would that be ok? thank you for your help!
1517	16	278610	3136410	3136401	aptivaa12	9/27/09 2:30 am	1.2540186e12	hp monitor	take as many pics as you can of all boards and the monitor while you have it apart. mainly the boards off the metal casing both sides of the pcb. send to aptivaa12@yahoo.com i'll edit the photo to show you what caps are bad. this will prevent you from sending me a board that may not be damaged as well and save yourself some postage. but please make them as clear as possible. thank you
