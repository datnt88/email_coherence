i have a new dell latitude which replaced an older dell latitude. my old dell had no problems connecting wirelessly to my router. the new one connects then a few minutes later locks up the router. i have to reboot the router for it to start working again. its using windows xp professionl service pack 2. if i plug into the wired connection it works fine. it also connects fine wirelessly at work. any ideas?
but is this setup per our forum sticky? if not there are some machines that won't stay connected due to drivers. but i've seen owners that can't work the issue and won't go with what works and lose many months trying to get it fixed. let's share those router settings and try it per our forum sticky. bob
i initially tried to update the firmware on my router but was using the wrong file. i downloaded and installed the correct file and it worked like a champ. thanks
i am having exactly the same problem with a used dell latitude i just purchased. i can connect to my network at home but when i try to connect here at work the laptop sees the network, says i have excellent signal strength but limited or no connectivity. when i try to repair the connection the laptop is unable to acquire a new ip. the router is a linxsys wap54g. can anyone help?
i find used machines often need the os reloaded according to the maker's instructions. try that!
