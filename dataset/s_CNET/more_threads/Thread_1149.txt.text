as the title suggested. how do you achieve optimal hard drive parition? or what do you think is the best way to achieve it? for me, i use partition magic but i am not sure if it is the best and whether i doing the right way with it.
it depends on what/how you want to partition. for creating new partitions (including logical ones) i use window's disk management and that has never gone wrong for me. however if i want to do more of the complex stuff that partition magic offers (merge partitions, rename a partition, redistribute free space, resize, etc.), i would use that. oh and for installing a new os, even though pm offers that i don't use it, i like doing it the conventional way. but if you like it, use it. i'm just stating my opinion
is there an optimal way to partition a hard drive? in general or in any particular situation, like &quot;tell me the details of your pc and what you do with it, and i'll tell you the optimal configuration for that machine&quot;? if there isn't, the only possible answer to your question is that it is an question without an answer. something like &quot;how do i walk to the moon?&quot;, or even &quot;how do i reach the end of the rainbow?&quot;. i think for most of us one partition per drive is optimal. and that's easy to achieve the first time you use it. no magic needed. kees
