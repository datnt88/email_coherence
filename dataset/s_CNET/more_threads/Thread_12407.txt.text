my iomega (model gdhdu) external hard-drive has stopped working (i think it's approx. 3 yrs old). i've tried a new power cable and it still doesn't work. is there anything else i can try? ( i was considering opening the case and using compressed air to clear any dust) is there any way i can access any data stored on it?
put the drive in a new case. after that we have drivesavers.com but because we all have backup copies, it's usually cheaper to get a new drive. bob
thanks for the advice, i will try that. i have backups of files with skydrive, but didn't know whether to still invest in an external hard-drive to back up.
as to getting another drive, even a memory stick has come way down in price. for some folk, the stuff they can't lose fits on 2 to 32gb memory sticks. and a nod to dropbox for another 2gb free. i have a few photos there with things i can't lose as the fifth copy in another place. it would be hard to delete all 5 copies. bob
thanks, i will bear this in mind as i do keep photos also on an sd card.
