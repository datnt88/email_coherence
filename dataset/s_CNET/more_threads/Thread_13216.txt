4982	5	596268	5472983	5473005	kimbodo	7/1/13 10:25 am	1.3726743e12	okay.	ive had a few bad experiences upgrading video cards on a computer of mine when i was a kid, and i didnt know for sure if my motherboard had a pci express 3.0 x16 slot or if that card would fit, but thank you for your help. so in conclusion i could upgrade my inspiron successfully with these parts?  and

4982	7	596268	5472986	5473012	kimbodo	7/1/13 11:05 am	1.3726767e12	it looks alright	i measured and it seems the boost wont fit, but the previous one i mentioned will definitely fit in my case. thanks for all your help!
