i have a six-year-old computer with a reset button on the tower. this button is convenient because when a screen freezes up it is easier to press the reset button than to press ctrl. alt. and delete. i need to buy a new computer but the stores that i visited only sell computers that do not have reset buttons. if i buy a computer without a reset button how would i fix a frozen screen? thank you very much.
if you buy a new computer one would think a frozen screen to be very rare. if necessary you can depress the power button for up to 10 sec and the machine will power off, you can then restart.
xp is so much more stable than w95/98. that's why the reset button is gone. xp can recover from frozen screens, if and when they ever happen. i have four pcs running xp home and pro and it never happens to me. then, again, pressing the power button for &gt;5 seconds powers off and you can power back up.
