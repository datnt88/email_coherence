okay i have an older motherboard (m5saa), it has a socket 7 interface. i know i know they are ancient and stuff but i refurbish older computer parts and make cheap computers that people can use such as me and my brother and sister. anyway the motherboard wont respond to any differences in core voltage bus speed or multiplier. i have also tried different processors. so it will turn on but no response from the monitor or hd or floppy. is there a way to fix this problem.
hi. any beeps from the speaker or signal from the keyboard? to check the board if it's good, turn it on and see if the num lock, keylock and scroll lock lights up. also listen for beeps from the speakers.
and does the power supply match the type? need a better explanation as to what you mean by &quot;no response from the hd or floppy&quot;. without video on the monitor it sure is tough to troubleshoot because getting into the bios can be so useful.
nevermind i know that i havent responded in a while so dont worry about im going to just throw the motherboard away, thanks anyway.
