i have been having a problem lately with my wireless internet: about one or two times a day i cannot connect to my wireless router through my laptop. when i view the available wireless networks, i can see my network and the signal is at full strength. when i click connect it says aquiring signal, but never connects. if i go reset my modem and router then try to connect it works fine. i have a cable modem with a netgear wireless g router. i am using a dell inspiron laptop with a netgear wireless g card. my wireless network settings are set to wep-128 bit encryption, on channel 7 and i have an access list with my laptop on it. i should also note that i have a desktop connected to the router via a ethernet cable that works even when my laptop doesn't. thanks in advance for the help!!
it's so fast today that it's not considered to be secure at all. try it our way as we note in the forum sticky. stock settings, ssid broadcasting, wpa and no other changed settings from stock. bob
the only option for wpa i have says &quot;wpa-psk (wi-fi protected access pre-shared key)&quot; is that the same thing that you recomended? also, should i eliminate the access list?
saves me from typing it. and yes, yes.
ok, changed all the settings, i also have a wireless print server that i had to update with the new password for the network and i updated the firmware for the router while i was at it. thanks for the help, hopefully this solves my connection issues...thank you for the help!!
