hi all - my xps410 (winxp, 4gb ram) began having startup problems this morning. upon power up, it gets to the windows xp startup screen, the blue dots scroll back and forth for about 20-30 seconds, then the monitor goes blank. i can start the computer in safe mode ok. i used system restore to go backwards a couple of days, but no luck with that either. what am i missing here?? thanks in advance.
while in safe mode, set the video mode to 800 by 600. ok your way out and then click, start, shutdown, restart.
i did try that with no luck - thanks for the suggestion. i have noticed that when the windows startup screen goes blank, i then hear the hard drive spin down. i have disabled all the services and startup entries in msconfig, that made no difference. i have removed ram sticks one pair at a time, as well as individually, also with no change.
that tidbit would have changed my advice. in this case i would head back to safe mode and research all items in msconfig and see what i could disable. remember i would not leave any any entry enabled unless i knew why. bob
