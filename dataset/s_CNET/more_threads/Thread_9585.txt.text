normally, one can change the &quot;region&quot; on a dvd drive to play dvd videos a maximum 5 times. my question is, what count as a &quot;time&quot; ? for example if i change the original 1 to 2, then to 3 then back to 1, that be 3 times.(?) if i change from 1 to 2 then back to 1 again, would that be 2 times or 1 time ? i.e. does returning to the last change count ? thanks. christy.
why do this? cnet told a secret at this article.  the result is your dvd which doesn't require such changes. due to the possibility of abuse i can only write this much and you must figure out the rest, but it is the answer to your issue. bob
...for supplying the article. seems not very helpful - at first glance. but then.. figure it out ? hmmm. so, the result is that regional restrictions are removed ? well, too much trouble getting that result. will be getting three dvd burners - one for each region...
there are other benefits such as being able to skip forced previews etc. this nicety is why you may find in my dvd cases not only the original but the dvdshrink copy. plus if i scratch the copy it's no big deal. hope it sinks in all the benefits. bob
.... but is it legal, making changes to the original for a personal backup copy ? anyway, have you already reveal too much ? it is supposed to be a secret, to prevent &quot;abuse&quot;, which you seemed concerned about....but then i guess many would be able to &quot;figure it out&quot; given that article. christy
