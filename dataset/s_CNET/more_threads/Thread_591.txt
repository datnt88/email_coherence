143	6	381695	3240812	3240732	simlhawk	2/5/10 10:04 pm	1.26540744e12	ok	if there is atx12v, i dont know where it is, but i will check the manual. the power supply is plugged in properly, i have cleared the cmos, but it still doesnt have video. i have tried with different ram, one in each slot... etc... but i still get the same beeps. i doubt that the prior user has tried updating the bios. they werent that technologically advanced.

143	11	381695	3241432	3241372	brechan	2/6/10 4:21 pm	1.26547326e12	perhaps you can attach a picture	of your motherboard to your next reply so that we can check if we can see if indeed you do have bad caps. not that we don't believe you, just seems odd.
