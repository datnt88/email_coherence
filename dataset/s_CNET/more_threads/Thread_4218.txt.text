well back to the drawing board here.i got a new geforce 6600 agp,mother board is a pchip board witch is also ecs main boards.(ecsm825vxx)witch is the same board as k7-m825vxx.i have a power supply that has been discontinued by raidmax,model number rd-350.my video card needs more power to work right.size is 5.9x3.4x5.5 i have been looking for one now for 3 days.but i can not find one.price is very importation. i would like about 500 to 600watts so i will not get in this problem again for some time.it would be nice to if it had some cool colors,but it does not matter. thank again!
i highly suggest you actually go to a store, bring your power supply with you and see which one is exactly like yours. i had to replace my aging psu, bought one from the internet and guess what it didn't fit. i brought my psu to my compusa and i got the right psu. remember size and desgin matters ^^.
thermaltake makes some cool ones with decent build quality in the watt range your looking for.check out their site. of couse antec generally makes the highest quality, but they charge a premium for the higher watt units. a thermaltake one should be more than fine.
on second thought thermaltake is pretty steap too.
