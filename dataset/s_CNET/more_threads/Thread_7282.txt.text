i recently purchased a 1 gig stick of pqi turbo low latency ddr400 ram, part number pqi3200-1024sbl. i mistakenly believed it was 2x512 mb. i'm thinking of trying to match this stick with another 1 gig stick for dual channel mode on a nforce4 939 motherboard (jetway 939gt4sli-g-vc). can anyone tell me if there's another brand that will do dual channel with it? finding the exact same ram stick for an acceptable price is problematic. specifications part number: pqi3200-1024sbl package: 1024mb single pack organization: 128m x 64-bit cas latency: 2-3-2-5 test voltage: 2.6 v pcb board: 8 layers pcb speed: ddr 400 mhz (pc3200) type: 184-pin ddr sdram error checking: non-ecc registered/unbuffered: unbuffered thanks in advance! adrian
the mobo will use the slower of the two sticks' timings.
what ram is in it now ...1-512mb, 2-512mbs, 1gb now ? vapcmd
wintec ampo ram there now, but hoping the 1 gig pqi ram stick can be paired with a similar stick for dual channel. i just don't want to buy another stick and have them not work together.
looks like there are matching dimms available ....what mb or system do you have now ? vapcmd
dual channel is based on bank size, not stick size. move the 2 512mb sticks into the first bank and put the 1gb sticks in the second bank. you'll wind up with 2gb in dual channel mode.
