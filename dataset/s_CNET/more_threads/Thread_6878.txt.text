last night i upgraded the firmware on the cd-rw/dvd combo drive and now the computer doesn't recognize it. its dead. i have a samsung sm-332b combo drive. the old firmware version was t-408 (from dell). i downloaded and installed version t-406 from the samsung website. kaput. i did a system restore to the previous day with no luck. how do i get back or get a copy of the old firmware? it's an older dell dimension running xp sp2. hey, at least i took some notes. thanks
while the maker and open it up to recover the firmware the costs are so high that you'll buy a new drive for under 50 (i paid 24 last time) for a new dvdrw drive. bob
the system. vapcmd
