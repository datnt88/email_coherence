hello, my computer keeps freezing up and if the cursor stops moving, my computer will make a steady high pitched noise. typing is even delayed at some point. this just started yesterday morning. i've done a virus check and none have shown up. does anyone know what could be happening? thank you for your time.
i find this caused by a few things. while no make, model is given let's try the usual. 1. clean it -&gt;  2. drivers. no make, model so i can't be specific. 3. malware. read  4. socket a machine? don't fix. get something newer. bob
i'm sorry about that. i have a gateway gt5404, 2007, was vista and i down graded to xp home in sept of 2008.
look at the first 3 suggestions.
thank you bob for your help. happy 2010 to u!!
