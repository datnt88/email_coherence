i just moved to the uk from the us and i am trying to get my desktop up and running. dell customer service is useless. is there a company that sells a kit to do this (uk cords, power conversion items, etc.)? any advice is appreciated.
my friends simply use step down transformers for the devices that don't run on 240. the items that are rated for that higher voltage just need a new cord or plug adapter. dell has little to nothing to do with this. your expectations are dashed here. bob
i tried to plug everything into a us power strip then i plugged the strip cord into a radio shack converter. i ended up hearing a buzzing sound through the computer speakers and then heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound before the circuit blew on the wall outlet. do you think i damaged the computer? i fear i may need a new power supply for the computer but how can i tell? also, any recommendataions on where to get power cords/step down converters for the desktop in the uk? thanks for your help.
you need to see what runs on 240 and what does not. the radio shack convertor has to be of sufficient size to handle what you plug into it. what parts run directly on 240 (or thereabouts) should not be on the convertor. the radio shack people should be chatty about this so take advantage and talk about it there since this medium is not as chatty. bob
