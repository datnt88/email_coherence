for a couple of days now our monitor resolution and color looks like safe mode and we can't change it. in settings, control panel, display, settings we have 2 choices... 16 color or 2 color. shouldn't there be more? i don't know what we had to begin with. we did some &quot;clean up&quot; of old programs from control panel, add/remove programs... maybe we dumped something by accident that caused this? we're have an hp pavilion with win 98. any help is appreciated!
you can: 1) reload the video drivers and/or 2) boot to a dos prompt and type in scanreg/restore, choose a time before the problem appeared.
thanks michael. we'll give it a try.
