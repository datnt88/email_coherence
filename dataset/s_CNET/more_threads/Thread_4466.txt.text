hi guys well i think its finally time to make the jump from crt to lcd (mainly for space reasons). my new apt is a bit smaller and i need the room on my desk i cant have my monitors taking up all the room. currently i'm using two dell p991 monitors that have served me well for along time. i do a lot of video work, premiere, avid, after effects etc.... so let the suggestions start pouring in please. i would like to stick with two 19&quot; monitors what do you guys recommend?
this writer thinks that you need to make your own decision. here's a link to view a huge selection. note that there is only one brand that guarantees no dead or stuck pixels, however never heard of that brand before.
from buyers. likely most of them are actually legitimate. i guess that a monitor mfr could have some paid friends post. i do not know whether newegg screens to insure that ratings are only made by actual buyers.
