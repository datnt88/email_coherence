after recently installing a new 80gb hard drive my local disk c properties says i only have 1.99gb of space.why isnt the computer picking this up,and could it be something to do with a partition on the drive?,ifso can anyone help as im a total beginner.im running with windows me.helpppppppppppp.
when you run fdisk, if you don't answer yes to large disk support, you get 2 (or 1.9999) gb partitions. start over. bob
ive tried running fdisk and ive enabled larger disk space but it doesnt seem to work.anymore ideas?thanx
you didn't describe in detail what doesn't work. but to give a little push, fdisk from microsoft only lets you delete and add partitions. but once you made that 2gb partition, then you limited what could be done. you would have to delete all the partitions and start over. some don't find fdisk easy enough and pay for partition magic. i never use partition magic since i learned too long ago how to use fdisk. bob
