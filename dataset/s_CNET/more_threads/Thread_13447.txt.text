i am not a computer genius but i know some stuff so here is the problem. i do not know if someone is stealing my internet, even if it is possible but i prefer to know the facts. here are the details: i use verizon dsl high speed internet. this is not wireless internet so don't tell me about securing router and access points (yes!! i read alot). here is the setup if its necessary. there is a box outside the house with a hard line entering the house. a telephone wire is connected from the hard line jack to a high speed modem which is connected to the computer. someone told me this but i am not sure of its validity, so if anyone knows please explain what arp is about. i was told to run a command named &quot;arp -a&quot; several times and count the number of entries i see. sometimes i get 7 entries and sometimes i get 8 entries. does the extra entry indicate someone else is using the internet? so here are the questions: 1. is the dsl type (mentioned above) stealable? 2. how to know if someone is stealing it? (any commands etc) 3. how to find the culprit if there is one? 4. what is arp about? and is there any validity to the above or is it just nonsense. please explain thank you people!!
since all internet connections, specifically the modem, have an address called the mac address, and this address is assigned to your connection and account, it's highly unlikely anyone could steal your account. when you connect another modem (the only way to get access to the account) to a dsl line, the host computer sees a discrepancy in the address(s) and will either stop working or deliver garbage. why do you think this is happening? call verizon and have them test for extra connections.
will help to understand arp and what it entails.
