(the thread title has &quot;pc&quot; so that the readers understand the kind of connection i want, to use the nas as a mass storage device) i want to connect it to the tv directly via usb.. that's the reason i posted the question.. i can' t find one that has that usb connectivity

(if samsung solves the never-ending-dlna-issues i'll put the wdplayer in another tv/room and use the led to browse and play my files over the lan.) thanks for everything.
