i desperately want to upgrade my old desktop but am not sure what i can do. i am running an old gateway g6 350 machine. i recently upgraded to windows me on this machine to utilize my cable connection, and i need to know how i can improve this machines performance. i have been considering a new motherboard with faster processor, but was beginning to wonder if i could just plug in a faster processor into my existing board. i have an atx board with an intel pentium ii processor running 350 mhz. l2 cache:512, pipeline burst integrated,100 mhz bus speed, package : secc, 1 slot. running 256mb ram. this is the only info i have on processor, don't know if it is enough. i have been looking for info on these subjects for days.can i plug in any atx board with faster chip? can i plug in any &quot;slot 1&quot; chip? is there a different &quot;chipset&quot; # or term i need to look for about this processor. would rather spend $ on upgrading processor than on more ram (only 2 slots). need help!!!
isn't upgradable, really. a new motherboard and processor are needed as a bundle, then you'll need ram to match. i just rebuilt my web server and got an elitegroup k8m800-m2 motherboard with onboard sound, video, and lan, an amd sempron 1.6 ghz processor, 512 meg of kingston ram. the board cost $79.99, the processor cost $59.99, and the ram cost $59.99. i kept the hd and optical drive. the board also has 6 usb-2 ports. i found an oem copy of wp home here  i installed everything in about a day. runs like a top. wayne wrinkles only go where smiles have been - jb click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software.
you can get a good power supply most anywhere. i put in an antec 350. seems like it was about forty bucks.
i've been looking at bundled atx motherboards and cpu (p3's usually around 800mhz)but was not sure if they would plug in/fit in the case and work with my existing dvd rom and floppy. also power is now a question. do i have to upgrade power with upgraded board? currently running a 200-250 watt power supply.
one thing to keep in mind is that dell, hp, compact and gateway will use non standard cases and mb. so a standard atx mb may not fit in your gateway case. a pii is probably a at case fromat so an atx mb will not fit. save up you money and plan on building a new pc. outpost.com has a amd sempron 2400+ and ecs mb for $70. get a new case for $50 with a 400wpsu on sale. a stick of 512mb ddrpc 3200 for $40 after rebate. a dvd burner for $40. a 128mb video card is $50. john
during my research i came across someone saying this computer had a atx board. how can i tell what type it is. i have opened case before to install cd-rw drive and lan card but have no idea how to tell motherboards apart.
here is a link to help. go to the mb section and click on the picture to enlarge. it shows a standard atx mb.  this shows a typical atx mb compare the postion of the keyboard and mouse plugs to yours. john  (socket%20462)%20nvidia%20nforce2%20ultra%20400%20atx%20amd%20motherboard%20-%20retail
if you want, you can tell us the details of your motherboard. download belarc advisor and run it. it will give you details on all your system hardware and a lot of the software.  copy what it says under &quot;main circuit board&quot; and paste into this discussion.
a simple way to get a lot of details about your system (and usually a motherboard manual) is to enter your computer serial number here:
the slot 1 transistion to socket 370 ended with some piiis running at 600mh. there were 2 mounting hardware configurations, as i recall. i had one asus board i remember converting to accept the piii module. after 600mh it was socket 370. so, you might find an old 600mh slot 1 module out there. if it's cheap enough, it might be worth a try.
board: intel corporation rc440bx aa718142-207 serial number: isrc84214592 bus clock: 100 megahertz bios: intel corp. 4r4cb0xa.15a.0010.p03.9809011626 09/01/98 thanks for the info
i still have my piii 500mhz machine from gateway. it is a slot 1 board that can take a pii or piii. i can't remember the exact model number, but it's an intel tabor something-or-other that can take up to a 550mhz piii. ah, the memories....
my boards layout is almost exactly like that one (build you own computer site)and my case hase two spacers/connectors lower than my board to accomodate a board with more pci slots. unlike specs for my computer i have seen, mine only has 2 ram slots.
thanks for the info i'm beginning to wonder if i shouldn't bite the bullet and buy a new pc and give this one to the kids. but with money as tight as it is, just trying to pinch pennies and get all i can out of ths machine.

i went through the same thing with my piii hp. i ended up scrapping everything but the optical drives and keyboard. you can get a new case for a little as $25, a motherboard/cbu combo deal for about $60, 512 mb memory sticks for $50, and an oem operating system for $80. don't forget the power supply ($40) and cpu fan/heat sink ($20). i'm quoting prices from memory, so i could be a tad off. when you add it all up, you'd probably spend about as much as you would for one of walmart's boxed entry-level sets. but what's the fun of that?
seems to me all your problems ly on you motherboard. if you want new technology, get a motherboard with a socket that can handle fast cpu's, and many of those motherboards come with x16 pci slot for a high end graphics card. many motherboards also have sli compatibility for 2 graphics cards. with a new motherboard, new cpu, graphics card, and more memory, your system will be up and running like brand new. i also highly advise you get a new os, like xp home.
it looks like an interesting project for the properly motivated. here's what i found by doing a quick check through the intel docs. current bios: 4r4cb0xa.15a.0010.p03.9809011626 09/01/98 newer bios available: 4r4cb0xa.86a.0020.p14 6/27/2000 the ''motherboard specification update'' pdf says that the new bios should enable the board to take ''slot 1'' (242-contact) piii processors up to 600mhz. the bios also enables the memory slots to take a 256mb module for a total of 512mb. it's up to you, but the money that you spend on the upgrades of the old computer could get you a long way towards the low-end pentium 4 or amd cpu systems that have been suggested in this discussion. anyhow, the bios update is free: rcbios14.exe
so can i assume that this means any standard atx board will fit into my case? and if so will work with existing hardware?
that was one of the questions i had in my original post. i am wondering if it is just that easy, get a newer atx board with a faster processor and heatsink, more ram, possibly a larger power supply, and just plug it into my case and existing peripherals. is it going to be that easy? will any atx standard mobo work?
'' so can i assume that this means any standard atx board will fit into my case?'' not necessarily. look on p.12 of the technical information pdf. section ''1.1 overview'' says the motherboard was made in microatx (9.6'' x 9.6'') and full atx (12.0'' x 9.6'') sizes. which one do you have? you could put a microatx board in a number of standard case sizes, but you can't put a full atx board in the smaller atx cases. if you are going to get a new motherboard that can accommodate a more recent cpu (p4, athlon 64, dual cores), the other components will have to be of a more recent generation as well. this includes the power supply unit (psu). new components probably will need a new case to ensure proper cooling, fit larger fans, accommodate larger heatsinks, et al. there are good deals on new cases that come with psu's.
look at all the different case sizes listed under &quot;type&quot;
i'd just worry about starting with the cpu you want and then add a motherboard. from that base you can add other components, including the case and psu. the way you decide on the cpu and motherboard is first to ask yourself what you want the computer to be able to do.
yes i did see that part. my board appears to be a micro. (9.6&quot; x 9.6&quot;) but my case has 3&quot; vertical clearance from bottom of mobo to bottom of case and extra set of connectors to accomadate (i assume) the larger board with more pci slots. my case has 2 pci slot openings in it that cannot be utilized with existing board due to its size. if i can't get a p4 (no biggie) can i get a p3 (or older athlon,not really up to snuff on their products)around 800mhz and still utilize existing peripherals, i.e. dvd rom and floppy. (also psu)i'm only trying to get as much as i can without building or buying all new computer. if it will only be a 600mhz processor i can get that probably won't be worth the effort and i would probably just build a newer computer (first time) to save $.
according to the specifications of the upgraded bios on your current mobo, you should be able to upgrade to this slot1 piii 600mhz processor; however i give no guarantees. for the price, it may be worth the tinkering.  problem is that you will still be limited with the 600mhz piii. a lot of today's hardware and software needs a faster processor or one with a specific instruction set. i think you are right--probably the only case items you could bring to the new build are the dvd and floppy drives.
well it's looking like i have a building project on my hands to get the results i really want. thanks for all the info and your help.
