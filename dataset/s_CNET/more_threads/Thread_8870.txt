(your software will cost more than your computer.) the one thing i do not like about almost all big computer builders, gateway, dell, hp/compact etc, etc, etc. is that they come loaded with salesware. it seems like almost every program is trying to get you to upgrade and buy the &quot;full version&quot;. this can create a situation where your machine is locking up due to all the programs trying to connect to their homepages. have someone help you clean up the machine before you end up with problems. happy computing a custom rig will not have all this junk to start with. buy antivirus and learn how to use it. learn about spyware - adaware by lavasoft is good stuff.

10838	5	54563	661953	650484	rschmitt	1/6/05 4:58 pm	1.10503068e12	gateway	i have a brand new gateway, a one year old hp at work and a two year old hp here at home along with dell laptops. i had huge amounts of problems with all the crap software put on systems by hp. i had to do a reinstall of the operating system to make it run right. the gateway came out of the box pretty clean. only had to deleat a couple of programs. don't get me wrong all the computers have served me well. i don't think the brand makes any difference any longer. all the parts on the inside are the same and the company is only putting them all together. pick the one that best works for you and always try to buy more than you need so you can get many years of enjoyment out of your investment.
