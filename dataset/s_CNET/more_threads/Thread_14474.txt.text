hi.... i installed an intel w3b2100 wireless mini pci card into my laptop,connected the antenna and loaded the drivers. i'm using a windows xp configuration and i get an signal that's excellent however i have limited connectivity. i do not know how to fix this problem!!!! i tried disabling the network card , tried to repair the connection......nothing works!!!!! help........... if you can !!!!!! thanks for your time and effort!!!!!!!!!!
i see that all the time when the setup is not per our forum sticky at  also your post told nothing about the setup details so let's start with the forum favorite settings. bob
you might check in services to see if wireless zero configuration is running. if it's not, start it and set to automatically startup.
