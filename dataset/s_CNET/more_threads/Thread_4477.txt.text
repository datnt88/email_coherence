hi i have a 82.3 gb deskstar hd works great, but it only shows up at drive
2 gb is what you would get if you used fdisk and answered no to large disk support. more than we all need to know about fdisk? -&gt;
do what r. proffitt says first. you might also want to check the settings on your hard drive itself. there are some jumpers on the hard drive which can cause your hard drive to show up as less that it really is. adjust them to make sure you get full capacity. this has happened to me before too.
