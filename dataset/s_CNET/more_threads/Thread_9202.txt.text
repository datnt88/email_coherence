i am having trouble with the axim. if you bump the back side of the axim, it gives a screen that says that the battery latch has been opened, or sometimes shuts off and will not start again for awhile. any fixes for that?
and ask what the exchange service cost is. as to the bump. don't do that. bob
i can't help but bump it on the back, as i use the device to tune pianos, and must have the device sitting on the piano. it only takes the slightest bump to make it malfunction.
you call its maker to get it fixed. there is so little we can do or replace short of the battery that you know where to go next.
