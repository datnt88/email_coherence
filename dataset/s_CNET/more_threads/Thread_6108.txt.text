i recently found that my computer would not start up correctly. i could get the hd to run, and everything running, except for the monitor. i tried 2 diffrent monitors, along with diffrent graphics cards. i shut off all power fully, and even unpluged everything. then randomly my father did the same thing i did with flipping the power switch on the powersuply and it started up. can anyone tell me what happend? should i be worried for the future. please respond, thankyou.
this is typical of failing components or connections. i usually back up what i can't lose first!!! then i can open it up, reseat all cards and cables and re-test. bob
you can take the memory out and clean it whith contac cleaner or an eraser from a pen! it should get your problem fix it!
