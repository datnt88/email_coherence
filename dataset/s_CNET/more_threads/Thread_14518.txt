5500	8	16627	185670	183816	ray harinec	3/23/04 12:37 pm	1.08004542e12	if your home wiring is reasonably modern, the third wire on	the ac power connector goes directly to the ground bus in your main power box. thus your case is always grounded as long as the power supply is plugged into the ac power. very difficult to understand how the cpu could get zapped. could see the radiated spike from the discharge causing a glitch on the software processing. very unlikely to cause damage, unless the computer is totally assembled improperly.
5500	9	16627	185674	184078	ray harinec	3/23/04 12:44 pm	1.08004584e12	again, the mounting holes should be connected to the mounting plate!!!!!!	but, nothing else should touch. happens a lot when one changes to a different mobo type and leaves a hex standoff at a place other than a mounting hole.

5500	11	16627	185693	183816	ray harinec	3/23/04 12:59 pm	1.08004674e12	let's be certain that we understand the use	of an anti-static pad. the pad has a resistor approx one megohm or greater. to ground. the pads function is to lessen the current flow that takes place during the discharge. [in effect, it spreads it out over time [tens of nanoseconds]. now consider that a properly assembled and grounded system has a very low resistance to the ground bus in your main electric box [a couple of ohms]. in this case you have the megohms of the static pad in parallel with less than an ohm. the discharge will be high current through the low resistance path. the purpose of the pad is that one should touch it first [and often, since simply moving stocking feet or leather soles, petting a cat et al can build up the charge rapidly]. by touching the pad, the discharge is so miniscule/unnoticeablethat you will have no idea that your body had a static charge.

5500	13	16627	185870	185815	ray harinec	3/23/04 3:39 pm	1.08005634e12	putting the washers on the underside	of the mobo is probably the most ridiculous and ludicrous thing ever done with the washers. if there were six or eight mounting holes it was the most outlandish waste of time [and incorrect] thing that could be done. however, i have a book by bigelow {pc desk reference] that said to do that. fortunately i worked in systems engineering with the people that design these boards and was involved with all aspects of the grounding techniques to use for high frequency grounding techniques and emi control [the noise on the dc voltage lines in computers is very high frequency, that noise is what is intended to be controlled/reduced]. mr. bigelow is simply incorrect. we actually had a 14 layer board in the minuteman system. [not a mobo, just a circuit board.]
