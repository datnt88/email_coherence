hello all, i am having a problem installing this linksys wireless adapter wusb100.. first off, i have this old hp 750n using xp that i am hooking up to my tv in my loft. my router is a linksys wrt320n connected to my dell xps420 using vista ultimate....with no problems. every time i try to set this adapter up, it shuts the pc down or has a hardware installation error come up saying that the adapter hasn't passed windows logo testing to verify it's compatibility with windows xp. the hp passes all of the requirements for this to work and is fully updated. the box says this adapter is good for vista, xp or even windows 2000... does anyone have any ideas on what the problem is.... if you need additional information i am more that willing to give it.... any help will be greatly appreciated.... thanks flu
run the installation cd first? i think the drivers have to be on the system before you plug in the card.
if you must have products that pass this then for this device you must return it now as many makers do not bother with windows logo testing. there are fees and more to be paid to get that testing done. try another product. bob
i ran the cd first and everything seems fine until i get to the part to put the adapter in....that's when everything bad starts to happen.... thanks for the reply...any other suggestions? flu
your adapter may be doa out of the box. take it back and get another brand.
