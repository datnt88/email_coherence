my psc 750 has a error message that reads &quot;cannot read color ink cartridge&quot;. i've cleaned the cartridge and printhead as per hp recommends and i still get the same message. any more ideas? thanks!
sadly, service on this unit will exceed its replacement cost.
check the expiry date on the cartridges. i wonder if they are too old.
it's been a good and trouble free machine. i will check the dates. thanks for the info
