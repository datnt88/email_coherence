can anyone recommend a good system under 1000 dollars canadian that has amd 64, and an nvidia geforce 6600 gt?
why not use froogle or bizrate or similar service to help in your quest. but, really you're expecting alot from what you ask? or simply save abit more $c to get that new system. i wish you luck -----willy
i'm not sure what kind of games your son wants to play, but i play online games like age of mythology on an emachines refurb with a plain 17&quot; crt monitor. the emachines amd 3000 cost $500 at  i bought another emachines for my relatives in the philippines on tigerdirect and it is doing just fine for graphic design. i'm not sure why i'd pay $1000 for a desktop computer. i'd be curious to hear from others what performance differences are really noticable on a higher end computer than p4/amd athalon 512 ddr ram, 128 mb video card and 160 mb hard drive. peace joseph
