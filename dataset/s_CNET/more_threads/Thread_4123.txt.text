i'm looking to buy a monitor for my new aurora, and i was wondering if anybody knows anything about the company asus. i've never heard of them, but they seem to get good reviews.
today's laptops usually have vga and many have hdmi. i suggest hdmi to save you some newbie troubles. however since you didn't supply the exact model number i can't be exact about the interface. in closing, do not buy a monitor on spec. go see it. bob
or  i was eyeing these two.
read the feedback on both. while my advice is from experience if you can't find it in stores to look at, both look safe given the feedback from buyers at those links.
