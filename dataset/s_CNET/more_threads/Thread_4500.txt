1524	2	171142	1896808	1891677	nathanpsz2	4/24/06 9:02 pm	1.14591252e12	the x800 is a previous generation card...	...however, it was the high-end previous generation card. the x1300/x1600 are current generation cards; the x1300 is the low-end card, and the x1600 is the mid-range card. the high-end current generation cards are the x1800 and x1900. you'll notice that the card names all have suffixes, such as the ati radeon x1900xtx. i won't get too deep into the suffixes; i'll tell you that xt is better than pro, and gto is better than gt. i could also get into the crossfire dual video card stuff, but i don't feel like it. -nathan
