a) getting a computer from the us, would it work over here(australia)? or; b)getting the cheaper, dell dimension 9100 with 3.2ghz dual core. the main programs i'll be running are premiere pro, after effects pro, photoshop, and 3d studio max 7.
i've read that the x2 perfrom noticeably better than the 8xx series from intel... they also, supposedly, are more future proof. the computer should work. hte only thing that might not would be the psu. i think you need to like change the voltage or something... but almost all psus have those switches... the xeons, i think, are better with the multi-tasksing. is that two physical processors, each with two different heatsinks or is that dual-core? also, maybe upgrade the ram, its cheap... -ibrahim
read  ooops. just if this was my money, i'd look at the dual core p4's with 64-bit or even the very nice amd x2s. bob
