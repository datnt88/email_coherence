hello, i have a hp pavillion 734n with phoenix bios. i tried to install a second hard drive with another xp on it. it booted up a couple of times, then the next cold start all i get is a beeping. i have no monitor or floppy. all i got is the beeping. i removed the second hard drive, but the beeping still continues. i tried to put in the restore cd's but they wouldn't boot up either. any help or thoughts would be appreciated. thanks in advance, bobby &quot;the beep&quot;
perhaps you can get a little closer to the source of your problem by looking here.
most likely you dislodged something putting in the drive, reseat video card and memory and see if that does it!!!
thanks for the help! bobby the beep
how the heck did you know that. you must have a lot of experience with fumble-thumbed lamers like me. fixed it right up! thanks. bobby the beep
