i keep my pc on at all times except when there is a major lightning storm, when i do turn it off. as an electrical engineer i feel by leaving the pc on keeps the electronics at a more uniform temperature and eliminates the surges that occur when turning it on. possibly turning it off overnight would not be to bad, but it is saving a minimal amount of kwhr to be left off. turning it off/on for several times a day is not very good for the electronics.
i highly agree about this--further reasons--the heating and cooling effect of turning on and off your computer can cause solder joints to &quot;dry out&quot; making them less conductive, and brittle. this causes easy breakability, and overall unstability of your computer. so it is definately worth the extra dollar a month to keep your computer running.
hi, sciencebook. it's arguable (very) whether it's better for you to keep it on or off. but in terms of energy demand (and we're going back into what was once called an &quot;energy crisis&quot;) and global warming, the answer is simple -- turn it off! furthermore, if you're on a network or broadband, the increased risk of someone sneaking in an open port and doing nasty things with the computer again outweigh the arguable benefit in longevity. -- dave k, speakeasy moderator click here to email semods4@yahoo.com the opinions expressed above are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of cnet!
