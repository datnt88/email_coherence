so i'm looking to upgrade my ram in my hp a6157c. i'm running vista 32. i've learned that means that i can't have more than 3 gb ram. right now i have 2x 1gb pc2 5300 ddr2 ram and i'm obsessed with having the best i can possibly have. my question is do i have to buy 2gb more of ram so that it's paired up? meaning, do i have to have 4gb of ram in the computer even though i'm only using 3gb of it? thanks in advance!
while you can use the /3gb switch to tell xp or vista to let applications use more than 2gb ram the brutal truth is there is so little payback that i'd not do this. and yes you get to (in most machines) buy a pair of 2gb sticks and live with 2.9 to 3.5gb being reported or usable with the windows you have. i wouldn't. bob
thanks for the input bob....so i really won't see much of a difference if i upgrade huh?
yes i tried bioshock on 2gb and it ran fine. i'm thinking this is one of the piggiest games yet. bob
you dont have to buy a 2nd 2gb if youllonly be running 3, as thats as much as the 32bit os recognizes. there are windows boot commands i believe as /maxmem you can use to manage ram size, but truthfully you dont need more then 2 gb. your just bored looking for something to spend money on! dont get more ram unless your desktop is a workstation, heavy on photoshop or 3d design, in which case youll probably want to upgrade your proc or gpu first.
