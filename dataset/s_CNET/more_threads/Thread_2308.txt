11282	7	511260	5053844	5053817	dbardoul	12/27/10 5:25 pm	1.2934707e12	still nothing	i turned off the power supply, took out the video card and then plugged it in, plugged some basic speakers up to the motherboard's green audio output, and heard no beeps and still no display.
11282	8	511260	5053847	5053844	r. proffitt	12/27/10 5:30 pm	1.293471e12	no beeps?	hmm, the plot thickens. 1. find that reset button and unplug that. i ran into a few that were shorted out. 2. double check your motherboard control wiring. one motherboard document was incorrect and folk could not boot as they had swapped the reset and the hdd led in the docs. about a 50% rma rate on that one. 3. any ide drives? unplug, retest (each step and idea here.) 4. check the back side of the motherboard. i've encountered a lot of extra mounting bolts shorting out the back side. 5. less is more. to get beeps, no video, memory, hdds, cd/dvds and well, not much is needed. 6. many boards shipped with the cmos clear jumper in the clear position. they stopped doing that due to high return rates (who reads the manuals?) bob

11282	11	511260	5053870	5053855	dbardoul	12/27/10 6:00 pm	1.2934728e12	ram	ok my motherboard has 4 slots for ram. 3 of them are blue and the 4th and closest one to the processor is black. i tried my stick of ram in each slot alone and didnt get any beeps. oh and by the way. the video card's box has a 6 pin pci-e connector that splits into two 4 pin ide connectors. i don't know whether to use the power supply's 6 pin pci-e connector to go into the video card, or to use the video card's ide splitter thing.

11282	13	511260	5053864	5053863	dbardoul	12/27/10 6:21 pm	1.29347406e12	ram	i bought four 2gb ddr3 sticks of memory and they all give no beeps in each slot alone. and still no video. i thought the card might not be getting enough power but i bought a 650w power supply and the newegg power supply calculator said in the lower 500w range.

11282	20	511260	5053891	5053869	dbardoul	12/27/10 7:00 pm	1.2934764e12	the manual	i read page 39 and i was putting my 2gb ddr3 stick of memory in the correct (channel c) slot. i did, however, notice that the description of the memory to be inserted into channel c shows &quot;1 gb, 1333mhz.&quot; i am using a 2gb stick as i do not have any 1gb sticks. so i dont know if that could be a problem. i also read page 42 and i am also correctly placing my graphics card in the correct (primary pci express x16) slot. now page 54 could be the main problem. i used the manual for plugging the power supply connectors into the motherboard. i saw that there were four slots to be plugged. i plugged the 24-pin connector into the slot, the 8-pin connector into the slot, and the sata connector into its slot. i see the fourth slot is an ide connector slot but i could not locate it on the motherboard. i do see where it would have been on the motherboard but it is simply an outline drawn on the board. the slot is missing or not there. as for page 55, i see the prongs of the bios settings but there is no &quot;jumper&quot; figure plugged into the prongs.

(typos for example!) it's been so long since i encountered a video card that didn't boot up to the hdmi display that i had forgotten about those early hdmi cards. sorry but that was just a few years ago and i ran into all of two of those. glad to see you got your machine sorted out. bob
