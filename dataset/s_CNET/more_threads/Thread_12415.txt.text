just recently my mate built me a computer and it has 2 hard drives a c drive and e drive. the problem is that the c drive only has 4gb while the e drive has 600gb. i dont know alot about computers so im worried about playing aorund with it 2 much without help but windows etc is stored on the c drive and it is always at low disk space. how can i get windows to load and install programs on the e drive so there is plently of room. is there any advantages to the way it is set up now. thanks for your help.
this is a quite ridiculous setup, that won't last long to break down. back to your mate and let him redo it. he should use windows xp setup to delete both partitions and then create a new one covering the whole 604 gb disk and install xp on that. kees
that setup was for them and not you. i'd heard many reasons why to do such a thing but to saddle a new user with such an onerous setup is just not nice. do it over. bob
