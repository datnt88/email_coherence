7326	6	298134	2793464	2793458	steven haninger	6/16/08 1:32 pm	1.21362312e12	good clue	try pressing and holding the button for a short if you're just giving it a quick push. there are bios options as to how to respond to that button. check them. that's a momentary switch that's just supposed to latch the power supply. they do go bad. you can probably find the mb connector for that switch and test it from there. it will be one of the front panel connections usually all grouped together.
