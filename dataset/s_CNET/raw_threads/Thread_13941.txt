10356	4	99921	1148759	1148418	ozos	4/23/05 9:31 pm	1.11429186e12	i'd take an indigo2 over an alienware	and i don't do server/professional, nor do i know where to obtain a decent mips isa os, nor do i care to find out i wouldn't like an alienware, or any botique computer for that matter also to alienwaresucks...um, is it possible that it got lost in the mail?
10356	5	99921	1273040	1146962	fightback	6/30/05 11:08 am	1.12012968e12	we were scammed too	purchased 11/04, received 12/04. mailed rebate form & original receipt via certified mail in dec. according to the rebate form &quot;please wait 12-24 weeks while we process your rebate&quot;. waited...no check. called and was told the rebate form was rec'd 1/3/05, but no &quot;receipt&quot; was enclosed. i've read of several others with this same story. we are considering a class action lawsuit (any lawyers interested?). the system may be good, but when a company advertises a price *post* rebate, it really puts a bad taste in my mouth to have to turn on the pc every day and look at it every day knowing that alienware has my $500 and the $500 of many others...
