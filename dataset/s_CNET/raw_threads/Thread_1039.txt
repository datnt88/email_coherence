(2) why waste electricity leaving it on, even in sleep or hibernate mode? really, how lazy and selfish can we be to not shut down our computers overnight? while it's only a small amount of electricity saved by each individual computer each night, take that small amount and multiply it by 365 (nights a year) and multiply it by tens of millions of computers -- and now you're talking a lot of electricity. the only beneficiaries of leaving the computers on, even in sleep mode or hibernation, are the electric utilities. everybody else loses. and really how lazy can we be if we can't allow 30 to 120 seconds for the computer to boot fresh each day? like any of us have 30 to 120 seconds we can't spare each day of our computer using lives? it's not like we are forced to sit at our computers while they boot up. so why can't we put this debate to sleep already (pun intended)? turn it off completely and do the smart thing.

5257	15	541694	5205331	5204916	batvette	9/18/11 6:24 pm	1.31637024e12	&quot;rebooting&quot;	it was the worst kept secret in the industry that windows 98, as good of an improvement as it was over 95, would get &quot;unstable&quot; at a bit over 2 days, the exact time was like 52 hours and a few minutes or something like that. so there used to be sound basis for periodic rebooting but i think no ms os since has had that flaw. your practice of idling follows my friend's expert advice, btw, (as i detailed above) he said all you really have to do is keep it so the power supply stays on, its heat is sufficient to keep the case from getting cold. i think this expansion/contraction due to temperature variances is made worse due to the lead free solder they are now using, it fractures more easily. (not to mention the other problem they are having with it- &quot;tin whiskers&quot; breaking off and straying into circuitry and shorting out- the military has lost quite a few missiles and at least one new satellite due to this, they say it's like ticking time bombs everywhere) the original design of the xbox360 has a reputation of &quot;not if it will break... but when&quot; and they've tracked it down now to the similar issue of excessive chassis heat causing the circuit board to expand and fracture the lead free solder. (fwiw you can make a pc last damn near forever if you don't mind fan noise. take out your oem case fan and install an industrial quality squirrel cage blower- i.e; ebm pabst, comair rotron, etc, cheap surplus. blowers make positive air pressure, fans do not. this will evacuate heat from the case like mad.)
