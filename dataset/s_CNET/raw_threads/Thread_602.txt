4637	0	556	5728	nr	johnnyboy4ever	10/24/03 10:07 am	1.06699002e12	no firmware updates for my version...	i have the mt1316b bdv212b ver 0.36 ... i can only find firmware updates for ver 0.40, 0.42, and 0.43. and the flash software all requires that i make a bootable diskette in order to install it. several months ago my 3rd diskette drive decided to stop working, and i dont have any other computers to steal one out of. if you know where i can get a windows flash software for a mediatek dvd drive, that would be nice, but until then, i'm kinda screwed... i doubt that if i updated the firmware it would allow me to view dvd+rs anyways... any other bright idears?
