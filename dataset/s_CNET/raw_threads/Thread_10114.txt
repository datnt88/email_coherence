(to anticipate a question, i do know the difference in a &quot;hub&quot; and a &quot;switch&quot; and my hubs are really hubs (i.e. simple repeaters).) second question: i know the mac address of the surfboard cable modem. that is not the address on the arp packets. i thought the cable modem was my interface to the world and my router would be talking to it at the ethernet level. that's clearly not the case. what's going on? thanks for any guidance you can provide.

(and i'm embarrassed.) the problem was with the monitoring pc. it was running a firewall. since i was seeing arps and dhcp traffic and not running any filters, i thought i was getting everything. the firewall (zonealarm) was allowing the arps, etc through but blocking all the tcp and udp packets. by lowering the security on the firewall, i was able to see everything. from this first attempt to look at the packets between the router and cable modem, i can see this educational exercise is going to significantly difficult. (at least for me. i spent days getting past a firewall problem!) i didn't recognize much of anything in the 200mb i've looked at so far. this education is going to be time comsuming.
