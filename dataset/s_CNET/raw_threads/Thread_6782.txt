6176	9	124756	1413386	1413076	linkit	9/10/05 4:00 pm	1.126368e12	graphics cards & motherboards	take a look at the budget gaming computer that extremetech.com put together. you don't necessarily have build the same machine, but the article will give you an idea of what to look for and why. heres their high end gaming pc google &quot;gaming pc&quot; or &quot;gaming computer&quot; and see what gaming computer companies (not dell, compaq, or gateway) and hobbyists are using for graphics cards on their low, midrange, and high-end gaming computers. pay attention to the interface-- agp is not the same as pci express (pci-x16). the motherboard you select has to have a slot that is compatible with your video card. as stated previously, a socket 939 motherboard with a pci express graphics slot should keep up with the latest games for the quite some time.
