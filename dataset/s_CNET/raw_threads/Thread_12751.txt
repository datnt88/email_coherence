(hears the trick buy all you cables a little long dress them neat into a box from both ends and hide the slack in the box. also all your power cables are dressed back to this box as well. i made a nice wooden box that my monitors attach to and on inside it is a power strip that goes to my ups and a usb hub. the result is all you see a couple of usb cables, a lan cable and 1 power cable. know you want the funny part i dont own a computer case with a window in it.
