6273	4	597722	5479843	5479647	bob b	7/23/13 7:51 am	1.37456586e12	i think it looks fine	the i7 would be better but you pay premium bucks for it and you don't get much extra bang. psu. get a quality single rail unit........don't be afraid to spend a few bucks. less future headaches.

6273	7	597722	5479946	5479667	a_bit_clueless	7/23/13 12:06 pm	1.37458116e12	if the link i posted doesn't work out	i may just assemble this pc. i might get a different case, though. i'd like a cool-looking case to show off a little bit, haha. other than the price, will it make a difference? i may just buy the case from my newegg link.

6273	12	597722	5479996	5480010	a_bit_clueless	7/23/13 1:55 pm	1.3745877e12	found a similar article.	and this is what has been confusing me about this whole situation. 2 different pcs with different components, around the same price, so what's the difference? this link seems to show better fps than the haswell:  is it all essentially just different names for the same stuff?
6273	13	597722	5479997	5479996	r. proffitt	7/23/13 1:57 pm	1.37458782e12	that has a &quot;next model up&quot; gpu.	the results would and did change. as a gamer, you know that they go for any edge. there is no limit. bob
6273	14	597722	5480041	5479974	bob b	7/23/13 2:29 pm	1.37458974e12	looks nice	everyone has their opinion about a gaming rig. this cpu/that cpu......this gpu/that gpu......etc/etc. i think that a top of the line i5 is all the cpu you will need for gaming. i think that 16gb of ram is a bit of overkill....8gb might be a better fit. you might want to spend some time and price the combo parts one at a time. cpu. combo price.......240. newegg price......220.
