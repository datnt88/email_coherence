13144	14	254577	2607159	2529162	remelda	10/15/07 7:23 am	1.19243298e12	not epson's fault!	dear kalli and bob. i've followed your conversation. this usb configuration problem with the printers and vista, is not an epson problem.i have exactly the same problem with a hp officejet on my vista laptop. this must be a vista problem. after all the research i've done, it looks more and more like a &quot;compatibility&quot; problem on vista's side. and the vendors like hp, supply the correct driver versions for vista, but there must be a configuration or setting somewhere in vista that's causing the problem.
