5087	5	12971	148223	148106	r. proffitt	2/23/04 10:35 am	1.0775325e12	i'm being too subtle.	i've dropped hints that there issues around usb, but without knowing the make and model of your machine, i can't tell if requires an usb filter driver, sp1 from microsoft or any trick as noted by usbman. just because one thing works, doesn't mean that another will without error. and the lack of a 98 test machine means that the possibility that the scanner is simply broken is still there. i'd love to see you succeed, but such information can be vital to find out if the os is installed completely since microsoft doesn't do it for you. here's an example tricks about usb on via based boards. i'd supply yours, but you haven't revealed the make/model/chipset.

(this was all prior to xp sp2.) the usb on the pc is fine with two different digital cameras and with a usb mouse. my conclusion: the scanner worked with xp at the time the drivers were written. a microsoft patch after that conflicts badly and unpredictably with the driver. no updated drivers from visioneer. it's now a paperweight. doctorcisco

(2) somehow, one of the microsoft updates is conflicting with the visioneer drivers and visioneer won't fix the drivers. i would appreciate hearing if anyone else ever figures our the solution. i would hook up the old visioneer scanner to one of the grandchildren's computers--i would use it if i could fix it, but would not buy another product from this compnay.

5087	27	12971	1262828	1253426	mbcowan	6/24/05 8:19 pm	1.11964434e12	visioneer support	i don't find the analogy with the automobile very persuasive. automobiles do last 10 years or more, and the manufacturers supply replacement parts for even longer. when an automobile breaks down, you can repair it--you do not need to junk it. visioneer abandoned this product after only one year or two. nor is the fact that support is &quot;free&quot; a justification. i was willing to pay for the fix (provided it didn't cost more than replacing the whole damn thing), paid for a telephone call, and still was brushed off. moreover, everyone knows that operating systems are constantly being upgraded and patched and buysrs have a reasonable expectation that the company selling you a peripheral will provide updated drivers during the life of the hardware (within reason). visioneer misled all of us purchasers when it reneged on this implied (but very real) representation. (any class action litigators listening??) this is a company that has no interest in establishing customer loyalty, and it certainly won't have mine. why in the the world would i buy something from a company that won't update drivers the day after i buy the hardware???? while i'm posting this message, let me add to my prior description of the problem: 1) first, we acquired the scanners from e-machines (now a gateway subsidiary), not compaq; 2) i tried to install two of the scanners on a ''clean'' machine running me. same problem. so it isn't a question of something corrupting the drivers after they are installed.
