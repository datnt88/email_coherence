13790	34	188979	2069287	2049119	photogbob	7/14/06 6:45 am	1.1528595e12	buying a new pc	luckylady_63, some other considerations in buying a new pc are: [1] how long do you plan to keep this new pc? the more 'cutting' edge pc you buy the longer for it to go obsolete. also the longer you plan to keep this new pc; then, the more you need to consider length of warranty, technical support, upgradability, etc. [i have an 8yr old gateway pc, that only the case & floppy drive are original equipment; everything else has been replaced via repair or upgrade.] [2] what type of technical support do you want? your friend and/or local and/or online professional? [3] how upgradable is the pc you plan to buy? inlcuding how many open 'slots' [of what kind pci or pci express or pci express x16 for new graphic card - graphics being one of the technologies changing the fastest.] how many open [unused] 5.25 & 3.5 drive bays [internal & external note: externals are accessable from the outside] which not only can support additional hard drives; but, things like additional dvd, cd, multi-card reader, etc.] how many unused eide & sata connections are there for hard drives, dvd, cd, etc. this could include moving your existing hard drive as a secondary [slave] in your new pc. how many ram slots are there and how many are used? [4] is the pc vista compatable? in case you want to upgrade later to vista [e.g. vista requires a dvd drive, should have 1gb - preferable 2gbs of ram, a 64mb - preferably 128mb or better yet 256mb graphics card note: the new ati graphic cards have capability to reformat graphic formats, e.g. reformat your ipod music video so it will play on your pc or burn to cd or dvd. [5] recommend that your ram be divided evenly into two 'sticks' [e.g. 1gb ram in 2x512mbs 'sticks'.]; since, most newer processors [amd or intel] have some kind of dual processing [or 'threading'] capability that works best if each has a seperate 'stick' of ram associated with it. [6] what type of sound 'card' do you want? on-board [i.e. embeded in the mother board (mobo)] or seperate pci or pci express card? creative labs [sound blaster, audigy, x-fi, etc.] is considered the industry standard for sound, and i personnally prefer seperate sound card [i have audigy ii 24-bit cards in my 3 pcs]. also make sure that the sound 'card' has at least a 5.1 speaker connectors [also some have 7.1 or better]. what type of speakers do you have? with subwoofer? note: 5.1 stands for a center plus left & right stereo front speakers plus left & right rear surround sound speakers = '5' plus a subwoofer [i.e. the '.1'] if you don't already have a subwoofer, i would add one; since, this gives the biggest improvement in sound after stereo spreakers, in my opinion. [7] does the pc have convience of 'front panel' connectors for usb-2.0, firewire, sound [head phones, microphone, other inputs?] my creative audigy ii platnium sound cards have a module in one of my front panel extenal 5.25 drive bays with varius sound card connections. [8] what peripherals do you have [or plan to add] to your new pc and what type of connectors do they utilize [e.g. parallel, serial, usb, firewire, etc.] how many connectors does the pc have? parallel & serial ports are manily used for older peripherals [e.g. printers, scanners, cameras, etc.] before usb & firewire [ieee] became available. usb-2.0 is now usually the prefered connector [i would not buy a pc that had older usb-1.1 connectors]. firewire is used for many digital cameras and some external hard drives. how many of these ports are in the front and how many in the back? many pcs now come with 4 to 6 usb-2.0 in the back and 2 in the front, as an example. [9] relative to dvd drive, i would opt for one that has all four +/- dvd r/rw formats [also lg makes one with a fifth format as well as these four in it - dvd-ram]. also all dvd +/- r/rw drives have cd-r/rw capability as well. some higher end pcs will come with a combo [dvd-rom + cd-r/rw] drive & dvd+/-r/rw drive; so, you can read from one drive & write to the other. also you mentioned that you currently have a cd-r/rw drive. what speed is it? depending on how old your existing cd-r/rw drive is, you may find the current drives are significantly faster [e.g. 48x or 52x read speeds as an example.]; so, may want to get new drive anyway for it's faster speed. you may also see reference to 'dual-layer' capability, this means the drive can read & write to two layers on a cd or dvd [e.g. for writing (burning/ripping) this takes special disks mfg for dual write capability - that are of course more expensive than 'single' layer disks.] [10] finally, do you have a surge protector or ups [uninterupted power supply] or 'smart' ups [e.g. an ups that communicates with pc, usually via usb cable, that will automatically save your data & shut down your pc in prolonged power outage.] note: surge protector only takes the 'spikes'/'surges' out of incoming power. most ups will also increase low power [e.g. 'brown-outs'] to even the flow of power to your pc and protect the various 'chips' in it. i personnaly have apc smart ups on my pcs and surge protectors on my phone lines [to all my phones as well the one connected to the pc] my satellite cable connection and all my tv & stereo equipment. also please note that power surges follow least resistant path to ground; and telephone, cable, dsl & satellite lines are all susceptable! so anything connected/'wired' to your pc can carry an unwanted surge [e.g. if monitor, speakers and/or printer, or other peripherals are plugged into wall or phone line, etc. and not into a surge protector/ups first; then they can carry a surge to your pc via its connecting [e.g. usb?] cable; even if the pc itself is protected. hope this helps and is not too confusing or overwhelming...bwh

13790	51	188979	2073319	2072938	brandon eng	7/16/06 8:55 am	1.1530401e12	there's nothing like google	hi steve- you start here from a bunch of google hits:  as to your last question, i would say not necessarily. sometime you simply get what you pay for- cheap in price, cheap in quality, so you have to shop very carefully. at newegg, i like to read the user reviews. but even with a quality part, like say, a high end video card, there's always unknowns, like the type of motherboard & bios- some baords and bioses simply don't agree. i'm an nvidia fan, so i always buy nvidia based cards, knowing their drivers are compatible with xp- unlike ati, i've read about too many problems with their catylyst drivers i wouldn't even think about buying an ati card. i've been building my own for about 10 yrs, so i tend to go with brands i'm familiar with, e.g, western digital for hardrives, creative for soundcards, leadtek for videocards/tv tuners; you can't go wrong with a plextor dvd burner, but many are happy with lite-on (very cheap) which seems to work very well for what they charge. i have a 5 yr. old lite-on cd burner/dvd player that's still chugging along very well. with ram, i almost always go with..it's a big name in ram....geez the name escapes me, but often you'll find &quot;no-name&quot; brands are in fact made by a big name vendor if you do enough digging. the first thing i always suggest to someone who's building their own is: what's your budget? then work from there. if you go to a configurator, when you're done, don't be surprised you may be spending thousands of dollars. the bottom line with any hardware- there's no guarantees. the top of the line can fail on you right out of the box, a cheapie can last for years. that's why for the most part, i buy my parts from a local pc shop, where, if the piece of hardware fails within the store's warranty period, i just bring it back to them and let them worry about it (i'm just lazy). my 6800 vid card that cost me a little over $400 tanked on me in about 8 months time- cuz i'm such a lazy-a** i still haven't sent it back to leadtek, who responded very quickly to my email. also take into consideration what your needs are- are you a gamer? no? then you don't need the fastest chip on the block, and you'd do well with 512 megs of ram (what i consider the bare minimum to run xp). are you interested in making your pc a &quot;tivo&quot;? then you need to make sure you have a free pci slot for a tv tuner card. not interested in that, then forget it, and move on. like making your own movies from your digital camcorder? then make sure you have a front firewire connection (less hassle than rooting around the back of the pc, and firewire is better than usb when transferring video- despite it being a bit slower in transfer rate). there are so many factors when building your own, and i'm by no means the person with all the answers- i'm sure someone will come in here and challenge me on ati vid cards- to each his own. i have my own biases as does everyone. don't take my word as gospel. sorry, gotta run, will try to add something later if it comes to mind. brandon

13790	53	188979	2073741	2073637	brandon eng	7/16/06 1:20 pm	1.153056e12	...continued	sorry for the rushed reply, and i'm doing so again (want to hit the pool with the kids,lol). ok, 2 questions: 1. what's your budget, and 2. have you made up your mind that you definitely want to build your own. your budget is a big determining factor whether you build yourself or buy retail of course. if you're bent on building yourself, and this may be the best bit of advice i can give you, do you have a knowledgable friend who can help you out? i say this because most computer parts are made in asia, and the translation leaves much to be desired. this is where the tech-knowledgeable friend comes in. even though i've built quite a few systems in the last few years, every motherboard will have something unrecognizable to me- to some, it's a piece of cake. i'm prety near-sighted, and i'm getting tired of holding a mini-flashlight in my mouth to read what's on the motherboard (you'd think by now i'd map everything out before i put the motherboard in-duh). still, for a first build, it would be helpful to have a knowledgable friend when you get to the &quot;wtf!&quot; point to help you out. that said, your needs seem to be as simple as the original poster's. not a gamer, so no vid card. i personally think onboard sound has gotten very good, so no sound card. i personally like a floppy drive myself; no biggie in cost, should be less than $15. i would suggest a 64 bit chip, preferably an amd (don't think intel has 64 bit for the home consumer anyway)- don't judge a processors speed from it's advertised speed- amd has it's memory controller built into the chip, so, say it's raw ghz is 1.6- that doesn't tell the whole story; you have to factor in the bus speed. my hp laptop has an 64 bit amd turion chip, raw chip speed 1.6- but it has a 1600 mhz bus speed. compare that to my current desktop- intel p4 3.06 ghz- bus speed 400 mhz. my point is, don't go by raw numbers you see. i may be inviting debate with the intel vs. amd crowd, but you can't argue with benchmarks- but for your needs, i really don't see a need for you to get the fastest chip on the block, but i do recommend a 64 bit chip, so you're &quot;future proofing&quot;. vendors will be coming out with 64 bit applications, so you'll want a chip to handle those application. my understanding thus far, is that vendors will make these apps backwords compatible, but if you're buying/building new, why not prevent any possible future headaches? as to single or dual core, i think it's moot as to your needs; for what you do, you probably wouldn't notice the difference. i'd say dual core if you were a gamer, runinng resource intensive applications, doing vid editing and the like, but you're not, so why spend the extra cash? no need to, imo. then there's motherboards that have the ram run in what's called dual-channel- speeds things up, but that means more expensive- for your needs, i don't see the need for it. if you buy a retail version of xp, you wont need a recovery cd; if you buy a retail pc, it should come with one. hd's are cheap; go to  and i bet you can find a 250 gig hd for well under $100. a dvd burner will play dvd's, so you can get by on one optical drive (i'm thinking of cutting costs here); if you insist on 2 drives (i have 2 dvd burners on my system- 1. because i have lots of left over hardware from previous builds, and 2. it makes things simpler if i want to make disc to disc copies. but, overall no biggie as to 1 or 2. for the most part, it doesn't matter which drive goes in which bay; one drive will be a master (depending on if you have it on the secondary channel) and the other will be the slave. the master/slave relationship will be determined by how you set the &quot;jumpers&quot; on the drives itself. if you have only 1 hardrive, you may want to &quot;slave&quot; 1 drive to the same ribbon the hd is on, and put the 2nd hd on the secondary channel as the master. generally, i put the cheaper of my drives as the master- but quite frankly, i don't see much of a difference. either drive will read whatever disc you put in; you can always change the master/slave relationship either via the bios or changing the jumper settings. if i had only 1 hardrive, i would slave the &quot;d&quot; drive to the hd, then put the other drive on it's own ribbon. but, again, with 2 optical drives, no biggie as to which drives goe where as far as bays. antec makes good power supplies, and i agree that 400 watts should be the bare minimum (dell normally uses 250). i use a no-name psu called powermaster or something like that, 550 watts. been using powermaster for years, and only 1 psu failed on me. most motherboards these days will have integrated sound, video, phone jack, and ethernet connections for high-speed cable/dsl. personally, i don't like integrated card readers, unless you have many types of memory cards, cuz, when you open up my computer, you're gonna see about 6 extra drive letters and get a headache. just my personal bias. most cases now will have ports for front usb, and firewire connections. i have to run for now, but take a look at someplace like tigerdirect.com or newegg.com and take a look at their &quot;barebones&quot; systems. these are partially assembled pcs with the motherboard installed in the case, then you add the ram, drives, and os and you're good to go. i'll come back later to see if i missed anything....

13790	55	188979	2074213	2073978	brandon eng	7/16/06 7:48 pm	1.15307928e12	ok, so it seems we've come full circle...	seems that your needs are like lucky-lady's. i know many would recommend a local shop to custom make a system for you; many would say ''build your own!'' despite your saying you don't have the expertise to do so. for your needs, which are very basic, i'd suggest a retail system from someplace like bestbuy or circuitcity. i'd say up to $1000 is a very generous budget for your requirements. check out the circuitcity site for amd (my preference) 64 bit systems. the upside to a retail system is the whole system is warrantied (but do check exactly what is warrantied and for how long). you may think about getting an extended store warranty. i bought a sony camcorder from cc, and never had to bother with sony. never really had a problem, but the salesman suggested that i bring it in now and then ''for them to look it over; cuz they'll end up cleaning for you anyway''- was a good tip. anyway, check out what you get with the store warranty- ideally, should you run into hardware issues, you can simply let them do the work for you- meaning if the hd fails, they'll replace and reinstall it for you- but make sure you know and understand the terms of any extended agreement. here's just one example of a pretty decent system from cc made by hp:  i'm not necessarily advocating this particular model, but just showing you one example of how cheap systems are, and this model suits all your needs (however, a quick read of the specs isn't clear to me whether there's 2 external bays for an extra optical drive). i just quickly looked at the amd based systems, picked an hp, a brand i know and like. spend a few bucks more, and i'm sure you'll find something that not only you will like, but more than suit your needs, and surely last you quite a few years. keep in mind the hp media center systems tend to come with not xp home or pro, but xp media os (or whatever they call the version geared towards multimedia). also, on many retail systems, there's a hidden partition that holds the installation files of the operating system. my brother in law asked hp to send him a disc with the installation files, and i helped him format the 200 gig hd to make use of the 30 gigs allocated for the hidden partition, and he ulitmately loaded xp pro. so ask the salesman that you don't want media edition of xp, but the home version of xp. even in retail stores things are nogotiable- it's just that people are afraid to ask. you've seen what i've said about hp's tech support, which i think is top notch. want something cheaper? check out the e-machines....but beware of the tech support, i hear it's lacking. not afraid to buy online? go to (vendor's name) website, and look for ''refurbished''. the it guys who don't like to build their own always buy refurbs. their reasoning is, there's actually more care in a refurb, because the whole system gets a good going over, as opposed to a something that rolled off the assembly line. just check online the retail stores like bestbuy, circuitcity, look for the same model #'s and comparison shop as to price. i'm no fan of my local bestbuy, but i know lots of people who love that store and their extended warranties- breaks, bring it in and they either repair or replace it. since i'm lazy, i prefer that method as opposed to possibly shipping the whole thing to who knows where. i bought the very first e-machine (500mhz chip! $500!), which served me very well, but when the floppy drive died, i had to ship it to california, who then shipped it to korea to replace the drive. the drive had a nice curve to it, so i couldn't just buy a cheap floppy and replace it. oh, speaking of floppies, since you want one, you may find it difficult to find a retail pc with a floppy drive. floppies are considered legacy devices more and more, so you may have to find a system that has a bay for a floppy drive you may have to install yourself. more and more, people are using usb ''flash'' drives instead of floppies. i still like floppy drives myself. as to tech support, there's no better place than these forums, but if you need it in the middle of the night, there's nothing like 24/7 tech support, so write down every question you may have should you head out to the nearest computer store. one upside to circuitcity, is the salespeople no longer work on commission, so there's no pressure by them, and i find the salespeople fairly knowledgable. just to muddy the waters a little, have you considered a laptop? it'll suit your every need, it's portable, and should the os go down the tubes, you generally need two discs to restore everything- the recovery disc to reinstall the os, and the drivers/applications disc for the hardware and applications. sometimes the applications disc will be seperate, so that's 3 discs. i bought my hp laptop for about $1200 when it first came out- has a burner, multi-format memory reader, 80 gig hd, it came loaded with 512 megs of ram, and i added an additional 512, has high-def screen, dual-layer burner that also plays dvds, a few applications. lately, i've been doing most of my computing laying on my back with the laptop propped up. just thought i'd toss that in there for you to think about. you should be able to buy the same model hp presario model v231ous for about $800 on sale these days- sorry make that a compaq. hp makes a similiar model. hp and compaq for all intents and purposes are the same, since they're the same company. has a dual layer burner, amd 64 bit turion chip. the turions were made for laptops- they don't get as hot, slightly slower than an a chip made for a desktop, but you can't beat it's portability, and the high-def screen is amazing. hope i've answered your questions. if so, happy hunting, and i hope this info helps lucklady, as well, since this is her thread. anymore questions, i, or someone else will be glad to answer them.
