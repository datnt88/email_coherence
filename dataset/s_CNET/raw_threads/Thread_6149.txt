6053	8	230055	2385398	2385381	r. proffitt	1/25/07 6:00 pm	1.169748e12	the only units i've tried ...	had the cd/dvd printer function with the printer. i can't say i'd go with some &quot;addon.&quot; but now that you've revealed the 50 to 100 quantity i'll suggest that there are services that may rival the price you'll pay for printer, media and learning that not all machines or dvd players work with dvd recordable media. bob
