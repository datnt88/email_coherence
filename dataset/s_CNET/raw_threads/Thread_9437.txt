(fyi - i tried to search for this information in previous threads but was not finding exactly what i needed. i apologize if this has been discussed recently and i missed it.)

13214	2	297363	2788974	2788889	vapcmd	6/8/08 7:24 am	1.21290984e12	there are many many options and approaches to backup	in the interest of not repeating the many many posts on the subjects addressed, please take a look at some of the searches below...starting with the one on 'backup'. i would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas. the one thing i recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location...whether it be electronic bits and bytes . . especially an external hdd, or even hard copy.   once you've explored the many approaches and eliminated those you don't want, you'll probably have a few more questions. hoping this helps. vapcmd
