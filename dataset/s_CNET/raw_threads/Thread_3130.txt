9224	2	293785	2766215	2766231	cwatkin	5/5/08 4:23 pm	1.21000458e12	it actually runs hotter with the side off	i tried running it with the side off and it would die before it has completely posted. i guess the airflow from the rear fans isn't as efficient with no side. i didn't know a computer could heat up like an oven in a matter of seconds until this one came along. getting it into windows is now impossible so running diagnostics tools is out of the question. i did get one last run of everest in before it got so hot it wouldn't turn on. it was running right at 100c at idle and would shut down if i ran any systems tests. i don't really plan on using this after all the grief but would use it as a spare if the fix is simple and low cost. otherwise, i would rather not mess with it and just buy a newer and cooler running setup such as the core 2 duo of the 45nm variety. thanks, conor

9224	6	293785	2766346	2766288	vapcmd	5/5/08 7:27 pm	1.21001562e12	what direction are the fans moving air...and what cfm	are they ? what else is in the box ? like ramarc suggested, might check to see if the heatsink is still secured...if it's not, all the fans in the world won't help. keep us posted vapcmd
9224	7	293785	2766338	2766312	cwatkin	5/5/08 7:28 pm	1.21001568e12	no overclocking here	i know the history on this one and it hasn't been overclocked and isn't overclocked now. i mentioned that it has been on the default settings since day one in my first post. also, the person using it doesn't know much about computers, much less how to overclock one. i did reset the bios to the factory defaults while working on it just to see and nothing changed. the system was pretty cutting edge at the time it was new so it is likely around 3 years old. i could look up the papers to find the exact age if anyone thinks that would be helpful. this heat problem seemed to build up slowly over the past 6 months or so. i didn't always watch this but noticed it was getting warmer with time each time i gave it a look. i always assumed dust was in something but the heatsinks and fans were always clean. the heat wasn't mentioned to me until the computer became unstable during the latter part of last week. i finally got around to looking at it today and noticed the extreme heat. conor

9224	9	293785	2766530	2766518	cwatkin	5/6/08 6:13 am	1.21005438e12	yep!	we are looking into the purchase of some new hardware right now due to these troubles. i have historically used asus mobos (this heat generator is on one) almost exclusively but am also considering gigabyte this time around. the savings in electricity will likely pay for the new stuff in a few months. as for the suggestions to make sure the cooler is properly mounted, i gave it a good look-over and all was well. the four clips were secure and there was no slop between the cooler and cpu. i loose cooler wouldn't explain the fact that the heatsink is getting smokin' hot while the fan is spinning like a jet engine. it also wouldn't explain the reason why the room was being heated to a sauna like temperature by this system. it seems that there is heat transfer between the cpu and the cooler, and then subsequent disappation of the heat. the problem seems to be that way more heat is being generated than was meant to be produced by this cpu. i also checked the power supply for over voltage and it passed with flying colors. this was also suggested by some other electronics nerd friends of mine. anyways, i am off to look at a 45nm intel cpu and a good motherboard to support it. we already have one of these and the power usage/heat generation is very low while the performance is the best experienced so far. i will let everyone know if i figure anything with the oven computer. thanks, conor

9224	11	293785	2766584	2766611	cwatkin	5/6/08 8:26 am	1.21006236e12	bad capacitors	i know that bad caps can cause all sorts of strange behavior. i also gave the caps a good inspection yesterday and none had bulging tops or were spewing electrolyte. i guess they don't always show their failure externally. this would explain potential voltage regulation problems through. i checked in bios and the cpu voltage is higher than spec. thanks, conor

9224	13	293785	2766647	2766631	cwatkin	5/6/08 8:38 am	1.21006308e12	voltage reduction	i tried to reduce voltage and the system refused to post then gave me an error &quot;overclocking failed, run setup&quot;. something has gone haywire as the bios is up to date and the temps slowly got hotter over time. conor
