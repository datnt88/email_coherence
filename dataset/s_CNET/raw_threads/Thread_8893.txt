(fonts would frequently get messed up.) i imagine the service may have improved by now, but i would *so* prefer being able to fax in a more conventional way. most of the documents i need to fax are not originating from the computer, often being forms filled out by hand. i'm having a hard time believing that there is *no* faxing option for those of us without land lines! it's becoming more and more common to not have one. can anyone help? (just in case it might be relevant: i have an older imac running os 10.3.9 with a mere 500mhz g3 chip and 384 mb of ram.) (...please don't laugh. i'm a poor social worker!) thanks!!
