1852	2	568755	5339630	5339610	tmhenderson4	7/25/12 5:43 am	1.34319498e12	more info	both computers use w7 home premium, workgroup, not homegroup. each has its own user name, same as computer name. no passwords. sharing &quot;my documents&quot;, and 2 printers. i made a shortcut with the ip address, which is reserved, and that connects to the computer, and shares, flawlessly. its only when i try to connect to the named computer, which is displayed under &quot;network&quot;, that i am told that &quot;the network path cannot be found&quot;. i found the suggestion for the shortcut on another message board. i can ping the other computer, as well, with the ip adress. the name just doesn't seem to ring a bell.

1852	8	568755	5339827	5339757	steven haninger	7/25/12 12:19 pm	1.34321874e12	here's a place i sometimes go for answers	if nothing there, i'd create that common user. i've made a habit of always using passwords with all accounts...except guest, of course...and never a mix of password protected and non-password protected users. it's all or none.
1852	9	568755	5340110	5339766	samkh	7/26/12 6:20 am	1.3432836e12	hmm	that shouldn't happen. i suppose you cannot ping the target too using computer name. if that is the case, name resolution in broken in your w7 configuration. if you can afford to experiment, change networking to homegroup to see if it fixes. if you don't want to do that or if you don't want to re-install the os, live with your ip method.
