3206	4	207049	2212652	2212546	wmkelly	9/18/06 1:07 pm	1.15858482e12	thanks for the tips.	i have several usb ports on the machine, so i will give the others a shot. probably have a spare cable around too. as for the drivers, if i don't have the latest, then i don't know where to find them. i've visited all the related sites i could think of and none had newer versions. i did actually find an update for one of the usb drivers, and applied it. it made no difference. i tried the drive on a w2k machine i have and got the same results. however, i am not sure whether the usb ports are 2.0 on it or not. i am sure that the ones on the xp machine are 2.0. as for wd's responsibilities--i made my purchase based on what they advertised the drive to be compatible with. i don't necessarily expect them to fix my problem. however, i do expect them to assist me in determining whether their product is at fault or not. if they are unwilling to do so, then i have to assume it is. (i don't know if you've seen the &quot;manual&quot; that comes with this thing, but it is two pages. their support site doesn't provide any more information either.)

3206	9	207049	2212787	2212697	wmkelly	9/18/06 2:07 pm	1.15858842e12	sites i've tried...	i believe it was the microsoft site that actually had the newer usb driver. there was nothing on compaq. via, the chipset maker, has a statement on their site saying they can't supply drivers because of an agreement with microsoft. by the way, my virus software doesn't like forums, which is why you may see some of my posts twice. i have to tweak it for each new site that uses certain types of cookies. it usually takes awhile to get the balance right.

(not that i can afford to, but really can't afford not to either. having gone through 2 weeks of hell trying to recover a system backed up on dvds...) i've revisited via and the ms sites. basically, it appears to be a know issue. ms has a fix, but doesn't feel comfortable with it. so you have to open a service call with them for which there is a charge (and it still may not work). the via article is at  . you can follow the link from there to the ms site, if interested.
