(click on &quot;play - intel for consumers,&quot; then &quot;find the right processor.&quot;)  (click on &quot;at home&quot;, then select &quot;help me decide&quot; under the &quot;tools&quot; heading on the right side of the page.) when you've narrowed the choice down, then start searching online vendors as well as local brick and mortar vendors in your area for prices. two notes: 1) you don't say what operating system you'll be using, but i'd recommend that you get 3 gb ram. 3 gb ram is the best amount if you'll be using vista, and it certainly wouldn't hurt in an xp system. 2) remember that a choice of cpu immediately dictates what motherboards you can use; make sure that the mobo you choose has the features that you'll need and that the cpu will support those features (usually not a problem). hope this helps, paul

5045	3	314675	2898280	2897916	ramarc	11/2/08 11:08 am	1.22562408e12	depends on your price range	the e7300 is a great processor for $125 and e7400 is $140. the 3ghz e8400 is $170 and will give you top-notch performance. (it's as fast as last year's $900 extreme processors.)
