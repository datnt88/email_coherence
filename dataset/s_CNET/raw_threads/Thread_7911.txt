12308	7	348510	3075270	3075217	thomasterrible	7/6/09 1:16 pm	1.24688616e12	ms os 7rc	ok well i was just reading the information from the microsoft site. if i can get them to understand how to plug in the ram chip they would have that covered. i read the microsoft instruction on the need to download the files and burn them to a dvd as an &quot;iso&quot; disc. i am not familiar with that term so i wondering what setting to use on my brand new hp a6700y (which i like) and came with one &quot;super multi drive&quot; installed and i installed a second. that way i could send her the discs and make things easier for her. i think until june 2010 with windows 7rc would be a perfect solution if they can just figure it out. they should be able to save up for a new pc in a year and you cant beat free. i will just make sure they back up everything on the computer they have now. if i can make the discs i am thining between the two of them they can figure out how to install them. thanks much

12308	9	348510	3075340	3075271	thomasterrible	7/6/09 3:46 pm	1.24689516e12	burning programs	well i believe these are the programs i have. windows media player windows dvd maker cyberlink dvd suite avega media centre quicktime muvee nero 7 for audio i usually just use windows media player and for dvd's i have been using nero. but whatever works best or if i need to download something else is just fine. thanks, tom

12308	11	348510	3076148	3076019	thomasterrible	7/7/09 4:38 pm	1.24698468e12	thanks	ok i will use nero 7. i downloaded the file when i went to bed so i can make the disks. i really would like to go over where she is to do this stuff for her i think they will have a hard time installing the dvd multi drive and chip and dont understand why they need to &quot;upgrade&quot; like this, even though it is all free. i think she may also be confused with the 7rc and the browser 7 but i tried to explain the difference. but thanks for the advice, the ram is too old to be useful for a new computer and the connectors for the super multi drive wont work with a new sata connection, but will make a big difference with her hacked together illegal os systemed computer until they get a new one and a year should be long enough. thanks, tom
