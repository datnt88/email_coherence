(how so?) -- soon. this new naming strategy will push the adoption of the term. (can you expand on this?) -- never. tablets are too different from each other. (how so?) -- maybe. it depends on what other tablet makers do. (like what?) -- other. (please explain.)

12656	7	558216	5286254	5285883	garmarfra	3/13/12 12:00 pm	1.33164e12	never	same thing as xbox or playstation are not a generic for console. apple is pretty good in marketing but there are enough different products and i will never call my tablet ipad. maybe things are different in europe than in the us because here we know that apple products are beautiful and overpriced and i don't want an ipad. also i didn't need an ipod... i knew that there was something called mp3 player and people still says mp3 player so i don't think the question is a real question. it won't be a generic.

(shows my age), the &quot;jeep&quot;? all the good products tend to eventually become part of the living language, and ipad being an excellent product will also become &quot;generic&quot;, (like ieverything). people that are &quot;splitting hairs&quot; re small differences will go the way of the edsel or commodore pet, or...
12656	14	558216	5286351	5286224	bobkg	3/13/12 3:55 pm	1.3316541e12	i don't think so.	i think it's too early to tell, and, like other generic names it may even vary with different countries, as the local slangs do vary. in the uk they refer to all vacuum cleaners as hoovers, but here in australia that is rare, usually only heard from ex british migrants, or poms as we call them. likewise if i ask for a coke i mean coke, not some inferior substitute. it was fairly common for a while to refer to all ball point pens as biro, but that appears to have faded and now mostly refered to as ball pen, also i'm not familiar with kleenex being the generic term for tissues, most people i know just call them tissues, perhaps because kleenex make many other paper products. however just to be ifferent we refer to our automatic pool cleaner as creepy, yet it is not a creepy crawly brand, so who knows what will happen. i can see that perhaps the tech savy people will use ipad for ipads and tablet for the others, the non savy folk may well call them just computers, who knows. howeveer as the population ages there will be less non savy people and eventually there will be none so the problem will go away.
