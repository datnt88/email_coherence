489	6	57448	1181669	682124	ray harinec	5/10/05 9:18 pm	1.11575988e12	when you reset the bios you probably	undid all of the proper settings needed for the way your drives are configured. the bios with these mobos with raid/sata controllers and sometimes two different ones are very confusing to set up properly. it would also seem to make sense to buy a ups to provide cleaner power to the computer. better than spending a money on a second cheap power supply. if it turns out that is your problem let us know. i can download the manual and see if i can help advise how to set the bios items. the glitch at the first turn on was not unusual. the system had been without the 5 volt standby power for a while. when you first applied power to the new supply, the 5 volts was immediately applied and the logic momentarily turned your system on then right back off. not abnormal really.
