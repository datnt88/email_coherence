(i removed the lan line from the desktop tower, and hooked it from modem to modem, then the short one from wireless modem to laptop! i wish i could draw u a diagram. anyway, somehow it is working. if not, get a stick and just put it in your desktop, let it set up a connection, then use it for a wireless connection in your laptop, and be sure you write down the information it gives you on the connections, or save it on notepad or wordpad. i hope this helps, and by the way, i do not have a phone line, got rid of it years ago! &quot;nicki-188&quot;
