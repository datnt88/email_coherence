10255	9	326526	2962438	2962421	r. proffitt	1/25/09 7:45 pm	1.2329127e12	then it's not a concern..	the sharing works almost as if you have the entire connection if you are getting email, loading a web site or such. you can pile 100 users on a router and it works super since no one is demanding long demands on the connection. your email is fetched and that's over. the web page loads and it's over. it's sharing at its best. however if someone starts downloading something big then you see the effect. bob

10255	11	326526	2962459	2962442	r. proffitt	1/25/09 8:00 pm	1.2329136e12	no.	the reason is deeply technical and you don't get an exact division of the bandwidth. it's a long discussion of queuing theory, packet sizes and probability. in the long run it may be 1/3 for each of the 3 users but you can safely bet it will not be exact. and it has nothing to do with who started first. yes, it's a fine thing to discuss in a class room but this small space would be overwhelmed if we truly dissected how it plays out in real life. can we go with almost 33% for each user during long downloads? bob
10255	12	326526	2962445	2962459	pianoman1976	1/25/09 8:10 pm	1.2329142e12	last question	okay. last thing i'd like to know is if a g band router can handle 6 mbits/sec from three separate computers at the same time - 18 mbits total. is this what &quot;throughput&quot; means. if so, g band can do 19 mbit/sec (per wiki) - so the answer is yes?
10255	13	326526	2962476	2962445	r. proffitt	1/25/09 9:18 pm	1.23291828e12	in a lab setting. yes.	but since your internet connection is not 18 mbits total and the wifi link is half duplex, all this becomes an exercise of how exact you insist the answer be and if we are talking about laboratory conditions and more. under ideal conditions, if the packet sizes are the same, if the response times are stable, the servers that are being fetched are responding on time, all things being perfect. remember i lived through the days of battle over the network protocol asynchronous transfer mode (atm) versus tcpip and you are treading right into the argument for atm. bob
