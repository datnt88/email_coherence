4713	5	388454	3276580	3276441	guerito	3/28/10 7:55 am	1.2697629e12	six cores???	now, i really don't see any benefit there at all. the ceo of intel in an interview on uk tv was quoted &quot;...there is no reason to throw more cores on a cpu because there are very, very few applications that can utilise them. the only advantage for multi-cores is weather and genetic modelling that's why intel are focusing on smaller transistor and die size.&quot; he goes on &quot;...hopefully/eventually we will be able to incorporate the gpu, the graphics card itself, into the cpu.&quot; if like most users 4 cores is more than enough, even excessive, where is the benefit for the home user especially when such a small minority of applications can utilize multiple cores? we're still having problems getting true x64 bit apps when the technology has been around for 10 years.

4713	7	388454	3276754	3276589	guerito	3/28/10 1:18 pm	1.26978228e12	bob, bob, bob.	basically youre saying dont debate the issue just get the hardware and shut up because if we owned the hardware then we wouldnt debate whether or not we should get it, we would be there with you bob. i use windows 7 x64 but only have dual core so i aint quite there am i? its nice you enjoyed the rhetoric back then and it was fun for you to sit back and enjoy the ride but now youre a moderator on a tech support site and should realise that the people that write in are looking for advice before they spend their hard earned cash and most of them dont own, use or write software on such machines because they need advice whether to buy such machines or not. this isnt the first time youve looked down on people that write in asking for help, i remember your previous replies to me.

4713	9	388454	3276781	3276765	guerito	3/28/10 1:42 pm	1.26978372e12	i think...	i dont get you bob. im a 100% sure youre a smart guy with a mountain of experience. i myself having been in the business of computing since the 90s can empathise with some things you say but what are you talking about nay sayers? when was p4 running xp mentioned? this thread is not about advising someone to buy outdated gear, what outdated gear are we discussing in this thread? cmon bob whats your real reason for not giving a s**t?
4713	10	388454	3276773	3276781	r. proffitt	3/28/10 2:02 pm	1.26978492e12	start your new discussion please.	i mentioned the p4 and xp as an example of the usual rain from those that bring out that we shouldn't be progressing so fast or writing about the new great stuff. this thread is all about &quot;gear&quot;. here's my challenge. dive in and help others out. write something great that i can put into a forum sticky! bob
4713	11	388454	3276797	3276773	guerito	3/28/10 2:11 pm	1.26978546e12	end of discussion.	im with you bob, it should all be about new gear, i didnt realise you considered the amd phenom iis as old hat. silly me. i guess you dont work on the xp or vista forums of cnet. i have helped and do help others out whenever i can. whats with the sticky? end thread.
