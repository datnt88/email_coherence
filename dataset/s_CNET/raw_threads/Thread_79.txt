(code 39)&quot; and is a yellow badge, and next to the stamp writes such a thing - adpobob3 ide controller  could this be the reason that usb 3.0 does not work as expected? my motherboard is a gigabyte ga-870a-usb3l i installed the new daemon tools but the problem still exists. i'm from polish, and poorly know english, i'm sorry for all the errorsin spelling.
