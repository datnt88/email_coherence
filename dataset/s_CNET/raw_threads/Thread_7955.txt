2245	4	390725	3287705	3287615	steven haninger	4/16/10 12:30 pm	1.271421e12	good question and i cannot be sure but	you obviously cannot enable and configure a raid array and use the hardware raid with one os and software with the other. i don't know ubuntu or whether a software solution is available. one thing that would bother me about both being software raid, if possible, is wondering if any interaction of either os with the other partition might break it. i gave up on raid a couple years ago so am not the best to ask about current technology.

(i prefer ultimate defrag) obviously i have no experience at all with raid's, as i said in the original post the only time i've made a raid is on a mac and that was as simple as &quot;click and drag the hard drives you want to be in the raid to this box.&quot; and i was done. lol. i just don't want this to be like when i bought a video card completely clueless and ended up with a &quot;cheap&quot; $120 card.
