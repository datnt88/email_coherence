12081	7	552582	5258576	5258565	r. proffitt	1/10/12 5:15 pm	1.3262157e12	then it's a bum router.	no router i know does this. keep in mind there could be some person that has that crack software and when the password changes that software is started which will cause speed to drop. i'm not there so i can't guess this. my suggestion is to turn off the wifi and get wired. no hacker can crack it then. bob

12081	9	552582	5261660	5261539	bill012	1/18/12 5:30 am	1.3268646e12	not router then	so if you have replaced the router multiple times it may be time to look at the pc side of things. since you indicated your pc works when plugged directly to the modem it implies your software and the ethernet port is good. the only thing different would be the wireless nic. since you can get a usb wireless nic for less than $10 it is a cheap thing to try. if you still have problems the last test would be to prove if it was the wireless signal or something else that is causing the problem. if you hardwire your pc to the router for a test it would eliminate the wireless. if you still have issue then i would be suspecting some software on your pc that is sending traffic your router does not like. could really be any application but torrents tend to be the ones that open lots of ports and may exceed open session capacities on some routers. if it works wired but not wireless and you have replaced both the router and the wireless nic you pretty much have proven it is some signal issue in your house. now the challenge will be to find the device causing the interference without paying a fortune for equipment that can locate radio signals.

12081	12	552582	5262070	5261808	mopscare42	1/18/12 5:17 pm	1.32690702e12	agree with bob	try a different brand router and see if you still have the problem. also is the router running hot? i have changed out some of those flat linksys n routers for customers with the exact same problem you are having. replaced them with netgear n routers that set vertical and run cooler. that took care of the problem and was never called back.
12081	13	552582	5262210	5262070	kiratheunholy	1/19/12 2:15 am	1.3269393e12	could be, i can try, though i cant afford a router.	i cant afford any router right now so checking that is out of the question, the reason i had purchased a new router was because my d-link dir-615 had just died on me. thats the only other router i have used besides the di-(forgot numbers) which was really old and needed to be replaced because it didnt support wireless n. unfortunately at this time i dont have any way to check interferences, but i highly doubt that its that because i've changed nearly all the channels.

12081	16	552582	5263011	5263003	r. proffitt	1/20/12 2:55 pm	1.3270713e12	then we're back to a bad router.	after all this there is only one last thing. forget wifi, turn off the radio and stay wired until you can change it. some wifi routers never work with some laptops. it's a shame that happens but it does. remember i can't survey your location for other users so we try what we can. bob
12081	17	552582	5263057	5263011	kiratheunholy	1/20/12 5:02 pm	1.32707892e12	not a laptop.	this is a desktop computer using a wireless nic internally, it has wifi capabilities though and i can confirm it isnt the single computer because it shuts off on all 3 computers connected to the network and an iphone. i am incapable of wiring any devices to the router though sadly. so it looks like i'm screwed.
12081	18	552582	5263167	5257307	r. proffitt	1/20/12 8:38 pm	1.32709188e12	we gave it a good try.	if the router maker can't help, and all the ideas here fail, it's time to get your money back for another router. i've worked too many routers over the years and even was on a team that created one of the early routers. i'm at a disadvantage that i can't see your site or swap out the router for a test. that's what we do when it's a stumper like this. but as you can guess, such a site call costs far more than a router and why most folk opt to try other routers. bob
