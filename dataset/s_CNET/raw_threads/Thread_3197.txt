12691	5	56485	673461	673304	jscarano	1/11/05 7:29 am	1.10542854e12	i had a geforce 3 before	i had a geforce ti 200 before i installed the 9700 and i uninstalled the nvidia stuff first b4 i installed the new card. i installed the new drivers off of the ati site. i hope there isnt any remaining nividia drivers that might be conflicting with the ati stuff. the geforce ran fine with the 450w psu. should i uninstall all of the ati drivers with there uninstaller then reinstall them? -jordan

12691	9	56485	674269	674114	toni h	1/11/05 11:44 am	1.10544384e12	my ati 9700 pro aiw card also made a	strange sound during encoding when copying or getting ready to burn a movie........it never locked up though. the sound if i remember correctly was a very subtle low click, too, or it was an obscure beep that didn't appear to be coming from the bios itself, now that i'm remembering this. curious now to find out what types of things you are working on when you actually hear this going on as ati tech support never did figure it out....however, i found some of these things during my trouble-shooting on my own and i can't recall if any of this stopped it since i have since replaced the card (using it in another system now that doesn't do movie intense graphics stuff and it's just fine there). ati 9700 pro aiw trouble-shooting i was getting audible either clicks or beeps occasionally while copying or getting ready to burn movies, and i believe it was due to encoding that was going on in the background. ati tech support was not able to figure out what was going on and suggested a few of these as possible fixes. i don't believe all of them were able to be done (such as the monitor issue until i got a different monitor) but somewhere along the line the problem stopped, and i honestly don't remember now which of these 'tips' did it. increase the agp voltage in the bios +0.1 at a time and reboot each time. default for me was 1.5 and go no higher than 1.7 for the setting. i reached 1.6 and it was ok. change the agp in the smartgart area of the card to 4x turn off fast write in smartgart disable smartgart by going to start/run and type smartgart and press enter set the monitor to optimal instead of the default install ich5 (this was for my motherboard, i'm pretty sure and i had to get this from the motherboard site) in troubleshooting of the video card, uncheck 'enable write combining' disable hyper-threading (this might be in the bios) toni
