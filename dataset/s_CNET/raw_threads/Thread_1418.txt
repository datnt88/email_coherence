11314	5	269198	2614725	2614652	willy	10/25/07 9:31 am	1.19330466e12	if and when	you did nothing to troubleshoot any devices and fell back on a reload. if the reload didn't load what would you have done? if any voltages aren't h/w dependant then yeah, i don't what is. you will report if your problems resurfaces later. good day -----willy
