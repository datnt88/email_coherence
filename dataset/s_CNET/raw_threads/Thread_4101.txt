(no part numbers to look for.) to help with this i need a link to the exact ram you bought. bob

9274	4	330145	2978474	2978274	darkzenlord	2/13/09 10:45 am	1.2345219e12	i encountered a simliar issue	nv4_disp.dll is a nvidia file. i see you use a 8800. i do too. this means the problem resides in your 1)video system and 2)video hardware. you most likely have a life time warranty on that card and will be able to get a direct replacement for free. i did and i also updated my drivers. my asus board has the led panel on back and i noticed when it failed to post that it stopped on vgaint. which turned out to be the 8800 failing to start. it's not your wow, cause i have managed to duplicate the problem in a multitude of other games. also let me know if you overclock your system and what you overclock including voltages. also let me know the manufacter of your gpu. my guess if i am right will be bfg?

9274	7	330145	2978564	2978474	stun4h	2/13/09 12:09 pm	1.23452694e12	card	the manufacture is evga. i didnt register it beofre 30 days after purchase and the 1 year is already up so i dont have any warrantys on it. could the card be causing the boot problem and when hte video messed up the sound messed up also which is on board. could the video card cause the sound to mess up and the booting/restarting problem. people have said the nv4_disp.dll sometimes isnt caused by the video card but i know its the main driver for it.
