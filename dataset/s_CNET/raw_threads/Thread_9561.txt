12036	7	553615	5265122	5265068	padyboy	1/24/12 5:47 pm	1.32742722e12	2 drives required??	thank you for all the information. i have a 1tb backup drive for the main hard drive. i was planning to get as large a 'storage' drive as possible, but i would than need another backup drive of the same capacity. unfortunately, i am living on disability and creation of 3 backups is well beyond my financial reach. i will have to determine the quantity of data on my main hd needing to be backed up. i must then use the available backup space to determine how large a capacity is practical on the storage drive. perhaps the external 250gb storage drive would suffice to backup the main drive. then the 1tb drive would serve to backup the new storage drive. i have ~190 video programs to backup somewhere., and intend to download more if my isp will stop screwing around. i found a 1tb wd hard drive for sale in canada, but this size could not be backed up under my current situation. much more consideration required and a decision to make. thanks again for your advice.

12036	9	553615	5265202	5265122	pixionus	1/25/12 1:22 am	1.32745452e12	i concur with profit	ive got tb of storage and not a lick of it is worth backing up. its just music, apps, and movies. the real stuff worth backing up thats actually irreplaceable will likely fit on a couple of 250-500 portables. that said, tb drives are likely going to be more prone to failure than small ones. do yourself a favor and determine how much of that data that you have is really worth saving. put it all in a folder, look at its size and copy it to two drives with barely 30 gb more storage. unless your doing graphic design or the like, you wont need any more backup space.
12036	10	553615	5265616	5265202	padyboy	1/25/12 6:00 pm	1.3275144e12	tb drives	why are larger drives more prone to failure than smaller ones? this is the first i have heard of this. tb drives are commonly used in business, whose data are much more important than mine. apart from banking info, my most important data are downloaded video programs, since i cannot afford to pay for them. the banking info i could store on a flash drive. you are correct in stating i must decide which data are worth backing up. my video collection would never fit on a flash drive. it is looking like my best bet is to purchase an external storage drive. although moving files would take longer, it would not be prone to an os crash. no matter how many backups i make, there is still a chance of failure somewhere. i can not afford to make the number of backups you mentioned. i still have much to consider. i value your continued input. thank you.
