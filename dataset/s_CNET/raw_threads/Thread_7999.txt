1523	2	139155	1563963	1563927	goldenboy	11/26/05 5:57 pm	1.13302782e12	did not work	i tried every possible combination using the original pair in different slots but i still get the same result. the manual doesn't say much about memory except that it can support three 184-pin ddr dimms up to 2gb and it doesn't have any sort of troubleshooting in regards to memory. should i try one of the bios or mobo drivers from their site?
