(the pci-express video card will override your built-in video.) the main contstraint is your power supply. its power rating is not listed in the pc's specifications but it's probably 300w. without upgrading your power supply you could add a geforce 8500 based card. here's a msi 8500gt/256mb for $100 . if you're willing to add a 400w (or better) power supply ($30-$40 or so) you could move up to a 8600gt for about $150 or a 8600gts for $170-$190.
