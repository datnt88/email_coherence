2806	7	389056	3281190	3281109	steven haninger	4/4/10 5:13 pm	1.27040118e12	if you're sure it's a video device error	than trying a video card appears to be your only option. hopefully the store will take it back if this doesn't work out but even a lower end graphics display card will offer video improvements over what you've become accustomed to.
