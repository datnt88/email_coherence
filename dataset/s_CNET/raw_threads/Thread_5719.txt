(i'm in uk by the way and have a bt homehub with three ethernet ports, one of which is free) knocking about somewhere i have an old tecom router that i could use if that's the route that i need to go down i know there's a lot of questions there but can someone tell me in words of no more than two sylables how i can set up a network? thanks
