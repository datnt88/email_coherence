3103	1	103838	1189083	1189043	michael geist	5/14/05 5:20 pm	1.1160912e12	swap the drive, it's	a &lt; $10 item.

3103	8	103838	2650724	2650721	scottpush	12/10/07 8:37 am	1.19727582e12	problems with floppies	doesn't work. i formatted in xp, then loaded a file onto the floppy. then tried it in my win 95 laptop and it wanted to format the disc again. when i clicked no then no file was shown on that drive.
3103	9	103838	2650765	2650724	r. proffitt	12/10/07 10:00 am	1.1972808e12	there was a boot virus that did that.	the reason for the incompatibility was traced down to a virus on the 95 boxes. but many forget this stuff. -&gt; the other workaround. go to bootdisk.com and get the dos boot diskette. create it on the xp box, boot that diskette and copy files to said diskette. done. the only issue i could see here is if the owner wasn't from 1995. bob

3103	11	103838	2650872	2650839	r. proffitt	12/10/07 11:33 am	1.19728638e12	&quot;i copied the files to a floppy off of my desktop &quot;	this means you didn't read the instructions. sorry but you may have to reveal if you are from 1995 where we used the command line, dos commands and such. given you are asking about windows 95 i pegged you as the usual user from that time period. i tried to gracefully note that today's users may be a bit lost but maybe i was too subtle. i also don't provide step by steps when the web sites supply that. -&gt; now run the file that you get from bootdisk.com and it will format the diskette and make the boot disk proper. good luck, bob

3103	14	103838	2650906	2650880	scottpush	12/10/07 12:12 pm	1.19728872e12	i	said i copied the file to the disc but didn't. i downloaded the boot6.22 program to the desktop and ran it. then it said put a clean disc in the a drive, which i did. then it copied all these files to the disc.
3103	15	103838	2650888	2650906	r. proffitt	12/10/07 12:48 pm	1.19729088e12	remember ...	i can only go by what you tell me. now all you need to do is boot that diskette. again, working with the usual 95 owner they'll know how to do that. or if they forget they'll look in the bios and set the floppy as the boot device. bob
