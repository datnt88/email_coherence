13091	11	189844	2058860	2058803	mcallij	7/10/06 10:25 pm	1.1525703e12	re: asus mobo	well, i bought the m2n-sli deluxe. the list of ram it supports in the manual is short (a chart on one page with maybe 30 entries). however, i bought all my stuff at once (thank you, student loans!!!) and didn't have a chance to see that my mushkin extreme performance ddr2 667mhz ram wasn't supported. and i didn't read the book, either. but, i dropped it in, cranked up the voltage to where it should be, and i have yet to have a problem. the only ram that i'm really seeing a problem with from anyone is ocz sticks. you'll have no problems (99.99% sure on this) with any corsair ram, since they have a little partnership going on with nvidia. mushkin should be fine, as i found out, also. i would assume the same applies to the m2n-e as well, since it's basically the same board, minus a pcie slot and firewire, if i'm not mistaken.

13091	16	189844	2065597	2064793	mcallij	7/12/06 3:46 pm	1.15271916e12	re: the psu	you're not supposed to be able to connect the 2 together. the plugs are separate. the 20 pin connector is on one portion of the board, and the 4 pin connector is somewhere else. so this is no problem, it's actually how the mobo is set up. --chedrz
13091	17	189844	2066031	2065597	ferty81	7/12/06 6:40 pm	1.1527296e12	psu	good news about the psu. thanks again your help was exactly what i needed.
