(it worked with my old laptop) way 2: when you boot it up, hold down f12 or f10 or esc or whatever it is ti get into setup. go to boot options and it should be on quick boot. change it to long boot and then save that and exit setup. press ctrl+alt+del to reboot. if that dosent work, go back into setup and do drive check (the long one) way 3: buy an external hard drive enclosure and put the broken hard drive in there. get norton partition magic and plug the hard drive enclosure (with hard drive in it) into another computer. use it to either repair the broken boot sector or make a new partition in it and put it back in the laptop when it gives you the option to boot from the 2nd partition, select that. you will probably have to rebuild windows. then, go to the first partion in my computer (whilst using the 2nd partition) to recover the files onto the second partition. then you can delete the first partition.

(i have been using kaspersky security for three years, and strongly recommend their products). the computer i currently use for office & home is a dell laptop with windows xp, with which i am very happy - no, i am not changing to vista. if their are any secrets i have found the ways to keep my computer trouble free are of course - (1) leave plenty of empty space on your computer hard-drive to allow your software to function efficiently, (2) have only 1 security service (for virus, hackers, spam...) that you understand how to use, (3) data should be stored (backed-up) on an external hard-drive, which should ideally be copied again to a second external hard-drive! on your computer keep only software (your tools) and your current files. for storage purposes i use two identical 250gb lacie external hard-drives. each holds the same information - all my files and a complete system back-up of my computer. these are slightly larger (physical size) than an old vhs video cassette. if i travel for a long period i take one with me in order to allow consultation of all my files.
