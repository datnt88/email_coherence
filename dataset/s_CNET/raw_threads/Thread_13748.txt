8695	9	273018	2638324	2637585	samkh	11/25/07 9:56 am	1.19598456e12	i take it back (about intel & ati)	not for the reason that monitor infs help, but because my dock doesn't support non-standard rez. monitor infs can't fix what's not in the adapter infs; they only serve to hide the modes that a monitor cannot display and therefore eliminate issue of overdriving.
