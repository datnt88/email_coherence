7031	5	226908	2366392	2366294	william551	1/5/07 1:57 pm	1.16800542e12	i wonder if you can make icons bigger	maybe setting them off aside from the others and spaced further apart. i know you can go into desktop settings and change the icon spacing width and height. maybe 80 or 100 is a good setting in &quot;appearance&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;. and then scroll down to icon spacing.

7031	8	226908	2368829	2367542	jbt	1/8/07 4:02 am	1.16822892e12	pfred	hi, we've been through the windows accessibility settings and they aren't good enough. we live 500 miles apart. thanks for your reply! i'm going to try next a graphics forum for logitech nulooq info and then try to find a forum that would know more about speech recognition programs that william551 suggested. thanks all!
