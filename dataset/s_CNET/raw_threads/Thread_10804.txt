4739	4	353446	3099105	3098967	vapcmd	8/10/09 6:00 am	1.249884e12	the 400 watt power supply is insufficient for those two gpus	and frankly your dealer should have told you that when you ordered your system. have you contacted them ?  400 watt or greater power supply (550 watt for ati crossfirex technology in dual mode) is recommended. vapcmd
4739	5	353446	3099375	3099105	dabrum	8/10/09 12:22 pm	1.24990692e12	actually...	well, i guess i have the minimum, because i actually havent installed the crossfire myself, because due to some confusion in the order, they had sent the bridge but didnt install it in the computer, so i will have to uprade the power supply before installing it...thanks for your help guys!
