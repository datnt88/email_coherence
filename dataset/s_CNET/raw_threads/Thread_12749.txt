10480	1	153745	1709450	1709383	toni h	1/31/06 5:14 am	1.13868444e12	i have had ati cards	for a long time, and i don't have a problem with their drivers or tech support. i've never had to call them on the phone, but their email tech support is usually pretty good for me once i was able to get past the language barrier for some of them. i wasn't crazy about the programs that installed along with the drivers and found some of them confusing to use and went to other programs that were easier, but all in all, i haven't had much to complain about. the programs were just a personal preference with me. what kinds of problems have you encountered or was your question just one in general as a comparison type of ati vs others? toni
