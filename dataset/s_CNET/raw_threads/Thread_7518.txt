2985	6	244191	2472702	2471117	ah732	4/28/07 9:14 pm	1.17779484e12	ok..now i`m officially worry	is doing it again..and the ppl from wd do not reply.. i would consider order the dual input cable thingy.... i can not believe the service of wd... i hope that it would get fix again... (silly question but i`m starting to think that is related somehow: if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive?? i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought?? thx again..)

2985	8	244191	2473968	2472792	ah732	4/30/07 1:36 pm	1.17794016e12	oh, yes i order one..	yes i decide to buy one and i order one a couple of hours after i reply my preview post.. what i was asking on that post: &quot;...if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive?? i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought?? thx again.&quot; is just me trying to think why it may be doing this error... bc i think that when it happens is i have been watching a movie that was one the external drive.... i would get the cord in about 1.5 week.. and still waiting for wd to reply my e.mail :?
