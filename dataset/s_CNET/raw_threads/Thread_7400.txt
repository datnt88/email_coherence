(please specify capacity etc). reason i'm asking is because the airport in my country normally checks all computers. i don't have anything immoral, only some pirated software (and the airport here makes issues and fines about that). i simply cannot afford to buy software!! so my plan is to launch dban when the authouraties decided to check my computer? do you think this could work in time? please advise. thanks dean

(and this is not my will, i only use it because my university insists that i use certain programs!!) secondly.. i did not ask you for any pirated software! what i asked is how long a perfectly legal program will take to run. as i said your argument is useless. well now ill just use dban myself and see how long it takes rather than wasting the rest of my time arguing with you.
