7696	2	556910	5279150	5279082	xmcpx	2/25/12 1:58 pm	1.33017828e12	need cord still	the cords are out there all over ebay for 10 or 15 bucks...that would be easiest, but i can't seem to find the right one. the hard drive is attached to the enclosure and i don't really know how to just change out the enclosure. i wish i could just plug it into the usb and make it work, but it needs external power obviously.
