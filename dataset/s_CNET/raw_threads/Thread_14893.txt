(skipped vista cuz it sucks.) i don't plan to use windows 8 because of the layout. it's a tablet os in my eyes. plus it's a high school assignment so practicalities are largely overlooked...

12843	8	579795	5395137	5395147	kees_b	12/9/12 1:15 pm	1.3550589e12	re: difference	the difference in ram only is important if the active programs (the game you run or all general use programs together) use more than 32 gb. then the swapping that is necessary might slow down the machine with less ram, even if it has a faster cpu. or not, of course, depending on the exact use. to compare the speed of 2 different x'es (be it cpu, gpu, ram, motherboard, disk) keep all other components (including the benchmark tool) the same. so the question boils down to 'what cpu is faster'. if you look at the cpu-tests at tomshardware.com, you see that that might depend on the task. it's quite imaginable one is faster for video processing, the other faster for a multi-core chess playing program or a doing sql queries on a 10 gb in-core database. so better start benchmarking! kees
