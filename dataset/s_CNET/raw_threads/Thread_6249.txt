13307	13	380924	3241103	3240966	ebbtides	2/6/10 9:22 am	1.26544812e12	bad &quot;bios&quot;?	bad bios is not likely to be your problem unless you made changes to it since your problems first started. if bios worked before (and no settings have been changed since then), then it is not a suspect. do not remove your bios battery without first backing-up your current bios settings!!!!!
