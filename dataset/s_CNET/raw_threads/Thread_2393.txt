10756	4	601893	5500432	5500286	the ancient one	9/21/13 1:43 pm	1.37977098e12	here is more info on my initial post	i guess up is the way. when looking at this modular psu the printing on the connectors is right side up when the psu fan is up. here is more info on the case. the bottom of the case is all open mesh and is designed for either 2 psu's or one psu and two fans. this came with two intake fans. there are no front fans, but there are two intake fans on the bottom (140mm), and two on the side panel (120mm), one exhaust fan (120mm) in the back and two (230mm) on the top. the psu also has the option of using of using what they call hybrid fan control where the psu operates silently until it reaches 20% load , then switches to quiet mode until reaching 50% load and then to cooling mode to cool the psu as needed. so it would seem that the exhaust heat from the psu will blend in with the flow of air as it moves toward the top fans.
