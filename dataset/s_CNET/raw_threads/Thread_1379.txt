[during memory count hit deleete, maybe]. make sure that the boot sequence is a then c not c first. you may not have an operating system on the hard drive.

3704	3	25411	284283	284273	ray harinec	6/9/04 4:48 pm	1.08679968e12	possibly a bad floppy drive.	yes i meant the ribbon cable. the stripe on the edge goes to pin one of both the mobo and the drive. not all drives show pin one readily, but after you reversed it, i think that it is now in the correct way. is the floppy drive controller enabled in the bios? [probably is, but]. is there a hard drive in the system??? change to c a for boot sequence and see what you get. even a message that there is no operating system is a useful piece of info. if the hard drive has the sytem files [the dos sytem files] on it, you can try some dos commands to see what happens.
3704	4	25411	284291	284130	ray harinec	6/9/04 4:53 pm	1.08679998e12	also, it is possible to put the floppy ribbon cable	on such that only one row of pins are engaged. the other row is above the connector. not easy to see it clearly. [any doubt take the floppy drive out and lay it on a piece of cardboard and connect it. did this twice last week when testing six new floppy drives before i put them on the shelf. finally checked them outside the case.

3704	6	25411	284432	284420	ray harinec	6/9/04 7:08 pm	1.08680808e12	re hard drives. &quot;no operating system&quot; does not necessarily mean that the	drive is bad. it simply may not have an operating system on it. what do you know about the status of the hard drives from their prior use? the floppy cable could be bad. on the 486's that i remember the floppy drive controller was actually on an io card [isa type] is that true of this one?? id so, you might be able to pick up another card for a few bucks. if you can get a floppy to work, and have a boot floppy with the dos system files on it you would be able to do some troubleshooting. i assume that you are taking this as a challenge, because getting a 486 working may be difficult. therte might be better solutions.
