13226	0	173125	1908198	nr	damian_j	4/30/06 11:34 am	1.14639684e12	which cpu would be best to use?	going on to a dfi lanparty ut nf3 250gb motherboard - and i have a choice of two athlon 64 3400+ cpus: ada3400aep4ax lbazc 0510apmw or ada3400aep4ar caa2c 0531epmw from the best info i was able to find - i think the ar is a clawhammer (it is also the newer chip), and the ax is a newcastle. (but i don't know this for sure) i am not a big ocer, but if i want to, i would like to have that ability, that is why i choose this particular m-board, and the lead question for picking one of these two cpus. i will be running xp-pro (sp2) tyia for any and all assistance - dam j
13226	1	173125	1908236	1908198	vapcmd	4/30/06 11:55 am	1.1463981e12	according to some sources amd single core cpu	prices to drop soon 15 may or so if i recall correctly. supsect dual cores will also drop when the am2 hit retailers too. for the info...the amd site should give you the info you need. vapcmd
13226	2	173125	1908947	1908236	damian_j	4/30/06 9:16 pm	1.14643176e12	need to make a choice	thanks for the time vapcmd, but i have the cpus in my possesion and i need to choose between them (can't keep both). besides this is a socket 754 board, so ''dual core'' chips will not be of help to me. do you (or anyone else) know of a reason one of these cpus should be favored over the other? thanks again for your attention - dam j
13226	3	173125	1909373	1908198	ramarc	5/1/06 6:51 am	1.14646626e12	both are more/less identical	same cache (512kb), same operating freq (2.2ghz). the ar is the newer rev. if you could find a 3400+ with ada3400aep5ar or ada3400aep5ap opns they would be better for oc'ing since they have 1mb cache and a 2.0ghz op freq (more headroom).
13226	4	173125	1910951	1909373	damian_j	5/1/06 10:32 pm	1.14652272e12	&quot;headroom&quot;	thanks ''ramarc'' for taking the time to post, and the terrific info site for amd cpus... i've looked for something like this for quite some time. i already have these two #4 chips, but if i had a 1gb cache chip, that's the one i'd be using alright. you're correct - the ar chip is about 5 months newer, but it also opperates at 2200mhz x11, while the ''newcastle'' is 2400mhz x12 - so like you pointed out in your post - ''headroom'' looks like the deciding factor. sure wish i knew more about reading the ''stepping'' codes. thank you again for your help - dam j
