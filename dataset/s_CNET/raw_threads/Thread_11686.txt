697	3	597542	5478822	5478804	thehelp	7/19/13 4:24 pm	1.37425104e12	hey bob!	hey bob, thank you so much for the reply. i want to start off saying, i am not a proffesionel when it comes to all this bios and software orientated stuff, i just assembled the machine. i did however go to the bios and tried a few different ram settings (2133mhz, 1866mhz & 1600mhz) as i had read on other forums and such that some people talked about ram speed could have a say in the system. my bios 'looks' quite new, doesn't mean it is the newest, of course. i will however look into this new bios you speak of, do you know what difference the 'new' bios should have compared to the 'old' ? thank you in advance.
697	4	597542	5478816	5478822	r. proffitt	7/19/13 4:33 pm	1.37425158e12	i hear you.	but reading the page there &quot;.improve system compatibility.&quot; it's an oxymoron that there was something they needed to fix. as presented i can't see the build so i can't check for issues like an extra motherboard mounting stud so i have to take what is presented and go hunting for issues and found one. ram speed should be auto for folks that just want it to work. and when it doesn't you call up and begin the exchange process. besides that bios i'm seeing some really fresh versions on motherboard and audio and didn't check the rest drivers at  it's highly unlikely the driver cd in the package is up to date when the driver date i found was 7/3/2013! bob
697	5	597542	5478878	5478816	thehelp	7/20/13 3:28 am	1.37429088e12	the graphics	hey bob, thanks once again. i installed the new bios and that works fine, did not help my problem though :\ i did however try to run a test on my graphics card, called 'furmark' which is benchmarking the graphicscard to it's fullest and here i encountered my problem again! - it shut down after less than 30-45seconds, so i think it's my graphicscard that can not handle the high-end loads as in grid 2 and metro: last light. although my graphicscard is a 780 and should have no problem loading these games. and like i wrote at first, it has no problem with the game, besides this, it runs so nice and smoothly - untill it shuts down i'm not a 100% sure if this is actually the graphicscard. and do anyone know if this problem could have anything to do with the fact that i bought quad channel ram instead of dual - its 4 sticks, 16gb @ 2133mhz thank you in advance.

697	11	597542	5478937	5478929	thehelp	7/20/13 7:25 am	1.3743051e12	furmark	i did furmark benchmarking yesterday night too, several times and it did the same as my games did, tried to reboot and then rebooted. then this morning i swapped my dvi-duallink cable to the other plug on the card and it's here it gave me error message instead of the shutdown. i've read on the internet people say this is fixable, because windows can't go with these rendering speeds, not sure if this would actually help though. also, i'm running windows 7 prof. 64bit and got me thinking, maybe by upgrading to win8 would help this, if it's a win7 & nvidia driver that's colliding thanks in advance.
