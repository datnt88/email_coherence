(thumbs up!) here's what i did to get the dvd/cd drive working: - i took it out of the case, started re-examining the connections... suddenly! (don't laugh ;-d ) i thought of actually reading the dvd/cd drive's manual! (hmpf! imagine that!) (ok, go ahead and laugh! i am!) - what i kind of realized/discovered by both examining the rear of the unit and reading (there's that word again...lol!) was that by default it was set as as ''slave'' drive from the manufacturer: lite-on! - now, with a quick removal and re-placement of the ''jumper'' to the master side, and closing back up the enclosure unit, plugging it all in, suddenly all lights were instantly on on the enclosure housing, and almost immediately after that, windows xp ''found new hardware'' and (check this out) installed it, but without any hesitation! - so, as you see leria, its only that little thing called: ''consulting one's owners manual first'' that i should have done in the first place. this one seriously has egg on my face! - thank you for your reply though. it is well appreciated. take care, leria! btw, why don't you update your profile? just wondering... l8ter... tony
1586	5	162677	1806563	1802417	tonytturner	3/14/06 4:49 am	1.14231174e12	thanks for your reply, blazerdude20... check this out...	in all honesty, you could be right about liteon, (and if you are, i'll be the first to send you an email to attest to it in about 30 days. - my thing, is that since i am fairly new to the ''lightscribe'' thang, i can't see spending about a ''c-note'' on one, and risking even hp giving me crap. (i don't think there is one manufacturer out there who doesn't have any probs, am i right? - i mean, yes, hp did indeed make /invent the lightscribe, but thank god for competition, so all these ''big biznessez'' (spelled wrong on purpose) can't monopolize on new technology. - if you read my reply to this issue above, you'll see that it was indeed my fault as to not being able to run it in the enclosure box. - i did a ''test'' lightscribe ''burn'' with a picture from the movie ''maid in manhattan'', and quite honestly, it's pretty freekin' good, man! :-d - i recently learned that liteon is a mitsubishi co. which does make some quality tech! (i've owned a 36'' stereo tv by mga/mitsubishi for about 8 years! it has multiple connections for surround / theatre sound, and...still has bomb-ass picture and sound quality!) - (i'll probably still get that ''vertically-standing'' black unit by hp because i do wish to compare quality! and i think hp is american-made! least i hope so! :-d ) - as i said, you may be right, blazer... we'll both know soon, right? - take care dude! (two thumbs way up!) - thanks again for your reply post! i appreciate it! - one! ~tony~

(and recently hearing that its a mitsubishi co. makes me happier as well! (please read my reply to blazerdude20 for my reasons why i like mitsubishi, ok?) - that said, thank you again for your reply...and your defence! :-d - i'm out... ~ tony ~
