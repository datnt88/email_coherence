948	2	318554	2919068	2918964	r_honey	12/2/08 8:48 am	1.22820768e12	criteria	my criteria is basically user-friendliness in configuration, and performance.
948	3	318554	2919121	2919068	r. proffitt	12/2/08 9:40 am	1.2282108e12	performance (speed?) is almost identical.	none seem friendly to non-network savvy folk. let's give all you listed a failing grade. however these are fairly technical items. i won't suggest any to users that are not network proficient. example, they know what a netmask entry is, and how dns works. bob

948	6	318554	2920389	2919705	r_honey	12/4/08 2:11 am	1.22835666e12	my own study	sure, i have done my own study. but these are the exact reasons why forums are there for!! every vendor makes claims about its products superiority over others. i thought someone here might have had experience with these vncs to provide an independent analysis of which one is the better one.
948	7	318554	2920458	2920389	r. proffitt	12/4/08 6:27 am	1.22837202e12	let me use this word. fungible.	these product for my use and what they do are fungible. that word should suffice why you didn't find a study. all fail for your need of ease of use. all of them however do function very well but require a modicum of network setup skill, understanding of what ports are, the difference of udp, tcp and such. i just connected the dots when i looked at your other discussion about the proxy issue. when i did that, it's clear to me that you need something much better than any vnc made today. bob
