12756	2	188552	2045525	2045427	nathanpsz2	7/3/06 6:35 pm	1.1519517e12	i reformatted the drive...	...about 2 weeks ago and i reinstalled windows. the first thing that i did after windows insatlled was to install the usb, chipset, and network drivers that came with the motherboard. hard drive drivers? i thought that windows xp had a built-in hard drive driver? anyway, my hard drive is an oem drive; it didn't come with any cds or anything like that.

12756	4	188552	2046219	2045990	nathanpsz2	7/4/06 7:30 am	1.1519982e12	when i installed xp...	...it asked me if i need to install a 3rd party ssci or raid driver, which i did not. the only drivers that came with the motherboard are an sata raid driver and drivers for the chipset, usb and onboard lan. all of these problems started happening after i installed this motherboard and cpu; before i was using a p4 and an hp motherboard. my pc was originally an hp, and that's why i don't have any documentation or anything for the hard drive. and maybe i should mention that i'm using xp home with sp2 and all the latest updates.

(don't know what the diff is but my front's only work at 1.1).
12756	8	188552	2047203	2047065	nathanpsz2	7/4/06 7:08 pm	1.15204008e12	i've tried both	the usb ports on the back of the motherboard are usb 2.0, along with the ports on the side of the case. i get the same message if i plug the device into either port. btw, the difference between usb 1.1 and 2.0 is the speed; i can't remember them off-hand, but usb 2.0 is a lot faster than 1.1.
