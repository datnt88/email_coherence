11864	9	602206	5507471	5504638	grawhib	10/12/13 8:18 am	1.38156588e12	mac	i know that mac os is stable and is resistant to viruses and i have had leanings in that direction but i have been using windows since it first came out and have many programs that wouldn't work on a mac, anyway a mac is basically a pc with a different os
11864	10	602206	5507581	5507462	kees_b	10/12/13 12:28 pm	1.38158088e12	re: upgrade	so that's a new motherboard, ram, processor and disk drive(s, maybe add a ssd) and os. that's in essence a new pc in an old case with an old sound card and an old dvd-drive. kees
