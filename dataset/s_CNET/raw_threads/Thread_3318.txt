4866	4	286162	2719493	2719394	blair.harrington	3/1/08 8:15 pm	1.2044025e12	follow up.........	it is set up per the sticky. i tried that link zmark provided. i downloaded the easylink firmware tool. to upgrade the firmware, i was prompted to plug the ethernet cable (from the back of my wired computer) into the laptop itself, with the other end already in &quot;port 1&quot;. well, the router never recognized the ethernet cable in port 1, so when i clicked to proceed forward, the router was not recognized, nothing happened, and i have the same problem. i vaguely remember now when i first got the router, i went through the necessary steps with the router and the pc, did everything fine. then i just started up my laptop, it recognized the network created on my pc, and i just used the internet on my laptop that way. however i have always received the following message when starting up my laptop: &quot;duplicate name exists on the network&quot;. i usually just x out of it, and proceed forward. so my question is, did the actions listed above create my current problem? why isn't my router recognizing the ethernet cable plugged into it from the laptop? also, is there any way to test if the issues stems with my network adapter in my laptop???

4866	7	286162	2719743	2719732	r. proffitt	3/2/08 8:52 am	1.20444792e12	tell me about the fn+f2 button.	doesn't the dell control the wireless card using the fn+f2 button? i'm sorry to ask this but do you know your laptop features or where to find them? bob
4866	8	286162	2719764	2719743	blair.harrington	3/2/08 9:18 am	1.20444948e12	....................	i've never had to deal with whether my network adapter was an issue, so no, i didn't know of the fn+f2 function. i'm wondering if i made a mistake adding my laptop to my network, hence the &quot;duplicate name on the network&quot; message i always get at start up. my internet connection is so inconsistent with my laptop. can anyone give me a step by step understanding of figuring out what the problem is (whether it be my network adapter, router, etc). any words on my inability to have my router recognized by my laptop via an ethernet cable?
4866	9	286162	2719752	2719764	r. proffitt	3/2/08 9:22 am	1.20444972e12	if you don't want to do it yourself.	there are support people available to come in and set it up for you. given you didn't know your own laptop is a sign. i'm sorry if this offends you in any way but unless you dive in you may have to call in the troops for this sort of work. -&gt; i agree the makers blew it big time here. this is far more complicated than it needs to be. bob

4866	12	286162	2720202	2720209	blair.harrington	3/2/08 8:48 pm	1.20449088e12	sad?	i tried to update the firmware and wasn't able to (i stated this before in posts). i wouldn't call that sad. i tried your suggestions and it didn't work. so now i'm trying something else. i understand your point, but again i'm confident the problem lies with the linksys router itself. especially after it was working for quite some time. plus, with all my online research regarding my current router, there have been a ton of user complaints in having many issues like i have had with this specific model. lastly, i don't see where the key combo you mentioned again was stated by a previous post. regardless, all that key combo did was turn the network adapter on and off, not really any help.
