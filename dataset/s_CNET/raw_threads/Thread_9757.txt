(there is an available, external, dvd option for it though) if these movies are going to be files, not a physical dvd, then bear in mind that the air has a relatively small ssd drive (256gb) a bunch of movies and a good size itunes library could quickly eat up 256gb. your local apple store will be able to supply any of the three machines that you have mentioned. p
