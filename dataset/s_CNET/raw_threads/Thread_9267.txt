159	3	123346	1401837	1398279	lisette	9/4/05 12:30 pm	1.125837e12	thank you	thank you for the hint, i will try to clean out the dust in my tower. i hope that you are right. i will start by that. can it be that some things in the tower can &quot;tremble&quot; loose due to passing trains? with your help i hope that the pc holds it till springtime, the time i hope to have saved enough money to buy a tower with a hard disk with more space than the 20 giga i have now. (forgive me my crooked english, i am belgian living now in france and not used anymore to write in english) thank you again. lisette

159	7	123346	1405808	1405724	ray harinec	9/6/05 5:24 pm	1.12602744e12	imho your statement makes very little	sense. if the body has accumulated a charge, tell me please, how the static charge gets dissipated while sitting on the chair, it will bleed off possibly, but please explain how long one must sit on the chair until the charge is completely dissipated.. i see no way that your message added anything to the lady's plight. yes i failed to alert her to esd in my post, but the next post clarified that in anunderstandable manner.
159	8	123346	1411331	1402655	lisette	9/9/05 2:19 pm	1.12627554e12	i am told...	that when you want to open the tower, you have to disconnect it with the little button on the back, take the electric cord away and touch the metal cover to loose the static electricity. that's correct no?but i can imagine there is some fright left in the box itself (like an old television). i didn't open the tower yet (lack of time: working from 8 till 18). the last time i openend the tower was when i installed the memup internal dvd-writer (witch by the the way, after 1,5 year,now refuses to burn dvd-r or +r but burns cd's -r,-rw,+r,+rw and dvd-rw and +rw without any problems!!?) i promise i will do it tomorrow, maybe i'll find a mouse or something..hihihi o, by the way, my beautifull blue light that lightend the front of the tower, went out....i can take a look at that too. thanks you all. i will let you all know how it went.
159	9	123346	1425071	1402655	lisette	9/16/05 3:22 pm	1.12688412e12	hi there,	yes, i opened the tower and &quot;spring-cleaned&quot; it. there was a &quot;little&quot; dust there (i couldn't even see the fans properly), so i took a screwdriver, little paintbrush and the respirator and went on cleaning for 1 hour. i even asked my husband to open the &quot;energybox&quot; to get acces to that fan too. i unplugged and replugged all the wires as far as the cooperated easely, the others (really sticky ones) i contented to give them a little push.however i didn't found any ghosts... no electric shocks, mayby because i left the tower off for a whole night. so far, so good. till now, the pc didn't have any weird behaviour. one last question: i have now a hard disk of 20 giga. can i replace it for a bigger one (say, 80 giga) with the configuration i have now?

[that is, to recognize the full capacity, the drive will certainly run, possibily with less capacity]. check to see iof there is a bios update for the computer. can you tell us what make and model it is? also what operating system, this may affect what you can do. as to a drive &quot;running&quot;, virtually any size will run, but the bios can limit how much of the drive can be used. here's a link to an article on the various drive size barriers over the years. fairly long because it goes back to day one. the latest is the 137 gb limit and that not only requires a correct bios but if using windows xp needs sp 1 to be installed.  the other issue may be related to installing the operating system and the drivers, if you are using a proprietary system [dell, hp, compaq, gateway et al]

159	13	123346	1435768	1435682	ray harinec	9/22/05 4:05 pm	1.1274051e12	now, what is the question?	the manual describes nicely the things that the mobo can support [use], but it doesn't tell us which of those things you actually are using. you told us the cpu, but the mobo supports either sdram or ddr sdram. we don't need to know if all you want to do is find out if it will take a 80 gb hard drive, however it would be good if you know. maybe do a google search for belarc and everest. download them and run them [either from your hard drive or from a floppy]. they will tell you virtually everything about your computer. nice info to print out and always have available. re the larger drive, you/we need to know what version your bios is presently. you can get that by checking the very first screen that comes up when you boot. the bios version will be noted on that sceen. then go to the mobo mfr's website to see if there is a later version of the bios. if you provide the name of the maker of the mobo and the model number we can look it up. the v266b is possibly the model, but who is the manufacturer?? i'll be seeing if i can find any info.
159	14	123346	1435778	1435758	ray harinec	9/22/05 4:17 pm	1.12740582e12	found a 266b made by jetway	if this is it, it supports ata 133, which would make it imo handle an 80 gb hard drive. i saved the link to the manual and could download it to look at if you have any questions [simply looking over your shoulder to read it. lol]. it will take either sdram, or ddr sdram [but not a mix]. really doesn't matter for the drive question, but just wondering. still can check to see if there is a later bios. here's a link to the mobo [in english] at jetway's site;
159	15	123346	1435786	1435758	ray harinec	9/22/05 4:21 pm	1.12740606e12	it looks as if the last bios update	for the 266b was a13 dated 10/7/2003. all it did was update the amd cpu name string. certainly nothing important.
