(more info about my job)	bob thanks, regarding the psu, it is not a problem. i could replace it with new 450 - 650 watts. sorry, i forgot to tell my job. i am freelance graphic designer. so working in photoshop and illustrator (and dreamweaver for coding) is the main purpose. gaming is not at all there. sometime i edit videos (i am using ms expression encoder 3 for now). and i like watch movie using my system. i hope these information will help you to suggest me the right one. thanks, ram.
