(it never goes to sleep like this if i'm using the laptop's monitor only.) here are its specs: the chip type: mobile intel (r) 4 series express chipset family adapter string: mobile intel (r) gma 4500 m total available graphics memory: 1326 mb dedicated video memory: 64 mb system video memory: 0 mb shared system memory: 1262 mb last night just before it went to sleep i noticed i could hear the fan running and it sounded like it was working pretty hard. any help would be greatly appreciated.
