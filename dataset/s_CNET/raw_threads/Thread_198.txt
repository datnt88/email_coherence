( i will sell the remaining 1 stick) or should i just buy kit with even number of sticks to be on safe side? it's these 2 kits:  this is 8gb (4x2gb), i'd buy 2 kits  this is 6gb (3x2gb), i'd buy 3 kits and sell 1 stick afterwards ps: i know one is 1600 and one 1333. the memory distribution will be 4x2gb in p5q3 and 4x2gb in p5p43td/usb3. what do you recommend? thanks for advice
