2994	5	408518	3368259	3368185	r. proffitt	9/2/10 4:55 pm	1.2834465e12	sorry no.	i have yet to see anything such as an usb wifi adapter that would work without drivers and a somewhat involved network configuration. and as you said, it may be that they forbid wifi. if so why put your job at risk over this? bob
