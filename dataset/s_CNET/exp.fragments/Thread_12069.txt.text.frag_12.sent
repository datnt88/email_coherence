if you don't know how to use the command line processor in your os (bob and i have grown up using ms-dos and know about commands like cd, copy and xcopy and what paths and wildcards are), then use explorer and accept that the machine is more or less unusable while copying files to it. 
ntfs is a good choice, by the way.
