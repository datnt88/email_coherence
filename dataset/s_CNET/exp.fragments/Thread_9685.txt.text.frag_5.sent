well its a family business that i work in not dealing with computers at all but i am the only one that works on and maintains the 10 computers that we use for work. 
so im stuck with just an hourly wage here. 
i have already tested the wall unit with volt meter and it measures out good, just a sliver over which is better then underpowered. 
how do i check the mainboard? 
contacts? 
battery?
