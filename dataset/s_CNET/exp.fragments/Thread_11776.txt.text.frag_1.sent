aloha, i need to buy a traveling case for my new lacie external hard-drive. 
can anyone help me find a secure case to travel with. 
i'm a video editor and it would be much better than what i do now (carry around the factory packaging). 
if anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks...
