it should show under my network places/entire network/microsoft windows network. 
i believe the default name is &quot;home&quot; but you can change that. 
i did forget to mention that each pc needs to have a unique name to identify it on the network. 
when xp is installed, if you don't give it a name, it generates a nonsense one. 
anyway, give each pc a name you will recognize. 
then, when you click on the local network name, all the pcs should appear. 
i'll also recommend that drag the local network icon to your desktop to save a couple of steps each time you access it. 
as for username/password, authentication works better if all pcs have a common user. 
this doesn't mean other users need to be defined on all but xp. often &quot;access denied&quot; messages are traceable to authentication issues. 
much is determined by how permissions are set up. 
i must admit to being more familiar with pro than home. 
home might be less restrictive in its default settings. 
i'd suggest you first work on getting the entire network to present itself on all pcs and have the shares visible. 
other details can be worked out after you get to that point.
