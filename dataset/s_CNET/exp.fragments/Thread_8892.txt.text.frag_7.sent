both of the outputs can be used at the same time yes, and in addition what you want is exactly what's being offered on the market right now. 
some pure digital guys are groaning about that but the video manufacturers have to supply what's in demand. 
a card with 128 mb of memory is not going to ''split'' the memory between the two monitors, it will use the memory as needed for either or. if you were a gamer, i would advise that kind of setup as a concern, but in your case, it's the ideal setup. 
i have two lcd's set up on my nvidia 6800 gt and it has never seemed to bother my in game fps even with the second monitor running. 
that's not to say that if a game was already pushing your card to the max, hooking up a second monitor wouldn't be detrimental, it would, but in your case i say go for it. 
just make sure the card you buy has a dvi to analog adapter giving you the freedom to use one dvi one analog or both analog. 
most of the cards shipping with a dvi out have this adapter, but some of the less expensive ones don't. 
may i also suggest that in my experience, my clients have ahd a much easier time with the dual monitor function of the nvidia forceware drivers than with any other.
