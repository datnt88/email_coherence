my dad bought me an ipad last month at best buy, but i dont like the rubber case that he purchased it with. 
any of the girls or guys on the forum that can give a sense of direction on where i can find a leather ipad case? 
i went back to best buy, but they don't seem to have much of a collection for women. 
i also checked online for a women's case, but i am not convinced they are made of real leather. 
i welcome any person that has bought a case that they are happy with. 
please post any pics or the brand, or where you bought your ipad case. 
thanks everyone! 
have a merry christmas.
