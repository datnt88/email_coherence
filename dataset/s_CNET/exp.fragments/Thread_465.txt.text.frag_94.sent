i have a dell precision 670 workstation, dual xeon processor, that i got to do graphics work. 
i do a lot of photography and work with old photos, especially old aerial photos, which tend to be pretty big (some get up to 250-260mb or larger). 
when i start manipulating them, the extract files can grow even more. 
so i decided that i wanted a graphics workstation like the pros used to do their work, and i've been very happy with the decision. 
it works well, does a nice job and is pretty fast. the only downside is the 64-bit o/s. 
sometimes finding things that work with it can be hard, but, so far, i've always managed.
