i tried a quad g5 with 4 gig memory in local apple store a week ago. 
it screams in photoshop. 
with 1 gig dual g5's don't scream, but they do reasonably well. 
on the other hand we have several laptops at home that have 1 or 1.25 g memory and they do reasonably well in photoshop. 
one of laptops is going to get a second 1 g memory and should be significantly faster with added memory. 
to have an idea what your machine is doing go to the activity monitor which lets you see what is running, how much primary task uses in time and memory and details of disk, i/0, etc. real good peek at working. it takes about 3-5% of cpu to run, so don't leave it on all the time. 
if you use laptops then the side ports can support an eternal screen. 
it is beside the built in, not a larger of internal screen. 
i have a 12 inch and 17 external. 
makes lots of sense as big screen can contain photo and small one all the menus. 
one good part of g5 big boxes is that they can supprt lots of displays, either huge big screen or several small ones. 
and slots can have extra display cards. 
my old 7500 can have 3 displays at once. 
i think these same cards can run in new g5's slots which would make an impressive simulator for one use. 
imaging a 20 inch screen (or larger in center and two on each side of say 17 inch. 
almost like flight simulators. 
enough dreaming. 
the intel replacement of imac sounds like a limited compromise as there is only two slot memory. 
2 gigs. 
when we get going in digitizing our family history box of photos over the last century and half we will probably spring for huge memory used g5 rather than intel. 
i presume adobe will have photoshop upgrades in not too long a time, but we have paid dues already.
