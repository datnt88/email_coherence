the issue bob is windows media player network sharing service is not in the services list and on most websites they all say to turn this on, but in vista64 it is missing. 
i have a program called orb that i found which allowed me to view video and music folders straight away but did not start/install the missing service as i hoped it would. 
media centre seems to work fine which is the really odd part of the problem. 
im not battering anyone but i am getting fed up trying to find info when i waste my time on so many sites which end with people not helping which is why im a bit fed up.
