ok, my mackbook recognises my router, so that i can enter its wpa personal encryption key. it accepts the key althought still wont connect to the internet. 
the status of &quot;airport&quot; in the network diagnostic is yellow, and underneath it says &quot;no ip address&quot;. 
it has something to do with my router because my macbook can connect to a belkin router nearby. 
i have tried turning the firewall and airport on and off but no luck. 
im also sitting right next to my router. 
&quot;after not being able to load a page, does safari display the network diagnostics button?&quot; 
yes it displays that and says it cannot fix the current networking problem.
