mind ..... many machines are optimized for ram in matching pairs....same mfg, same speed, same timings and capacity, and some machines do not run well on 4 dimms. 
if it were my pc...you could get 1 dimm to match the 1 you have, or 2-2gb dimms (usually a kit) and not use the existing 1gb dimm or perhaps 2-2gb kits ...with 4 1 gb dimms. 
if you really want 4gbs ram...then a 4gb kit consisting of matching 2-2gb dimms total 4gb. 
that would be the optimum combo and in addition would allow you to use the 800mhz ram vs the 667mhz or 533mhz ram. 
who wants to go slower ? 
just make sure you follow the mb mfg specs with regard to the ram voltage (1.8v if i recall correctly). 
do a little shopping and see what you come up with...try crucial.com and newegg.com 
too. 
once you've narrowed it down...post here for final comment. 
vapcmd ps...you can always sell the 533mhz 1gb dimm or give it to a friend so it's not like you're thowing it away if you don't use hereafter.
