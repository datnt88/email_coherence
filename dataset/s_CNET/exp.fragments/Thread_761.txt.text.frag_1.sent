i have a microsoft wheel mouse optical and am running xp. ever so often the pointer onscreen locks up and will not move. the keyboard work and i am able to restart the computer, which resets the pointer, but after a few hour and in the middle of a game or program, the pointer will lock up again. 
i've downloaded the updated software from the microsoft web site and the problem remains. 
anyone know what the problem is and how to fix it or do i need to buy a new mouse?
