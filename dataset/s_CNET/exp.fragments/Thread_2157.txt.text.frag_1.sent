i have three printers and not a one works properly. 
one is an hp photosmart c4480 (all-in-one) which prints for my mac os x, 10.6.3. 
it was working ok for a while and now it only prints blacke. 
even pictures come out black. 
i have bought new cartridges and downloaded the latest software. 
the next pc. is a dell dimension 2400 using winxp i pretty much rebuilt after hurricane charlie got through with it. 
anyway, i have a kodak, easyshare (all in-one) printer with that and it won't do anything with black. 
it will print in colour but looks very much like a negative. 
new cartridges installed and the latest software downloaded. 
i bought a used printer to help me get by while i tried to solve my problems. 
it's an h.p deskjet 5650. 
i invested in two new cartridges and plugged it into my ibm laptop thinkpad. 
strange thing is, it will print a beautiful hp in blue at thebottom of the page and hp deskjet 5600 , at the top. 
i should mention that a while ago i had them all wirelessed and could print on one printer from all three. 
trouble stared when we bought the mac which i hate! 
i'm quite good with windows although both of my othe pc's are running winxp&gt; apart from being frustrating, it's getting expensive and my computer illiterate husband is sure that i am the problem. 
if have always thought that most of you moderators are geniuses and hope someone can advise me. 
thanks, hopefully, val fasig
