a common cause is the video card has come unplugged. 
i don't see where you tell us you opened it up to check all cards, connections. 
another 3 beeps is no ram. 
just a few months back someone brought one in and we opened it up and there was no ram. 
good thing we did or i bet they would claim we took the ram.
