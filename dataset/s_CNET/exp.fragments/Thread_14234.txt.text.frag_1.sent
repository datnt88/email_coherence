i am in need of a upgrade for my main computer. 
i mostly use that computer for gaming and graphic/web design. 
i have never used amd so i am not sure if i want or can come up with a good system based off their cpu's. 
however, if someone can come up with some ideas for highend amd system that will work with what i have in mind; i may take a look. 
i will list the parts i have come up with so far and i would love to hear any feedback. 
also, i have a limit of about 2300 to spend.
