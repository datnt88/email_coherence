dban is not a 'quick solution' and if you're waiting at customs at the airport expecting to be checked, you will not finish the process in time. 
that in itself would be suspicious and if i were a customs official i would begin investigating further if a traveller turned up with a laptop running dban or similar. 
i find your post rather strange. 
saying that you have &quot;pirated software which is not immoral&quot; is a matter of opinion. 
i find it immoral, and offensive. 
we don't discuss piracy in these forums and such discussions often get locked. 
but not only that, if you cannot afford to buy the software, then you don't use it. 
it is that simple. 
if you cannot afford to buy a car, do you steal it? 
if so that is a criminal offense in most countries, and to me software piracy is the same. 
you do realise that dban wipes everything? the whole hard disk. 
nothing survives. 
that's it from me but beware, i am tracking this discussion. 
any 'workarounds' or otherwise replies that i feel contravene forum policy and i will start deleting and will lock the post.
