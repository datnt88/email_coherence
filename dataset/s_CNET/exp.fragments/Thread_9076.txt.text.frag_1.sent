i have an hp pavilion notebook that has issue with playing audio. 
whenever i play music or view content with audio the sound stutters occaisionally. the problem is more likely to occur when i am opening a program, which leads me to belive that it's a memory issue, but i have a 256 in there already. 
any ideas? 
also, my battery now only lasts for 15-20 minutes or so when not plugged in. the machine is about 1.5 years old, is this normal? 
thanks
