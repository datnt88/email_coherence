depending on your experience with pcs, should be your deciding factor. 
basically, if you had past problems you weren't able to correct or you're all thumbs then get the warranty. 
the std. 
warranty usually protects against alot of mishaps if product produced(not user) and that happens cross-fingers within the warranty period, in other words, use it often to get the kinks out. 
plus, read the fine print, any warrnty won't cover user produced problems like spills, lightening, or drops, they weasle out of basically you weren't suppose to let that happened, unless they provide &quot;we'll cover anything&quot; then again read the fine print. 
extended warraties usually are money makers for the providers as alot of equipment does't fail overall, and then they claim its your fault anyways, so disprove your claim for repairs, yeah it happens. 
so the decision is yours.
