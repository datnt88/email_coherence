well, as long as thhe new 2 gig works, and fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads quits crashing left and right with memory errors like i'm getting now, i'll be happy, even if i can't upgrade to 4 gig. 
firefox and ituns have been just up and disapearing a lot lately....even without a crash error....gets frustrating....long as that goes away, i'm good to go.
