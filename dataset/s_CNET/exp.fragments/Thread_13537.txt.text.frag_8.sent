for everyday backups i use an external hard drive. 
every week or two, though, i select some of my older data and back it up to cd or dvd. 
i make two copies of each disk. 
only then will i allow the data to be removed from my hard drive. 
i do not consider an external drive to be a permanent solution. 
i also insist that i have at least 2 completely separate copies of the data before i consider it backed up. 
i like my system. 
it allows me to make a copy of my data quickly and easily. 
i just have enough sense to know that the quick copy is not entirely secure, so i have another method i use regularly.
