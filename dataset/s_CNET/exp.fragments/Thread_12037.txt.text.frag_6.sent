but it won't affect frame rates in games. 
if you found this old pc with say a 5400 rpm drive, for cheap i could fit a 7200 rpm drive and the improved boot and load times could have the owner happy for a bit. the 230w psu is just too low to consider any card on the list. 
and without knowing which 500w you have so i can check rails, i can't be sure it will do. 
that's one reason why you hear folk asking for a single rail.
