for gaming, you could consider an intel dual core from the core 2 line. 
the e8400 would outperform the phenom in most games and save some money (from your post i assumed the lower $$ for amd was the motivator), and i see it around $200ish. 
there's others to choose from too, of course. 
i'm afraid right now amd just hasn't kept up with intel for cpus for gamers (i still really like the phenoms for general office use). 
i know i'm not alone in hoping they catch up. 
but for now i really think intel is the better way to go. 
as linked above, the data are pretty clear when you put em to the test.
