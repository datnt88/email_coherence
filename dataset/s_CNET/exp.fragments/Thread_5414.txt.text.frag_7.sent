again, with the multiplier locked, the only way to oc the proc is to adjust the fsb. 
you wouldn't need new memory to run dual channel, just a board that supports the feature (assuming you have at least 2 identical sticks). 
there is no such thing as dual channel memory, it's a feature of the mobo. the speed of your ddr memory will affect the ability to overclock as well.
