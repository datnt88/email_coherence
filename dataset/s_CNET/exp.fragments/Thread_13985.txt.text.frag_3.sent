thanks bob, a few feet has made a difference but its now in a place that will probably cause my wife to pick it up and throw it in the bin! 
(bin = thrash can) i need the repeater because the wpn802 repeater is better at connecting to the primary than my wireless connections in the computers are and i have several. 
i'll check into the wpnt834. 
will i need two. 
do they have a repeater mode?
