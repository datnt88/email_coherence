hey hey! 
i really need help how to setup a network between a pc and a mac (osx, 10.3). 
currently, i have a ethernet cable connecting these two machines together. 
on the pc side, i have files that i would like to transfer to the mac. 
i right-clicked the folder i wanted to share, and made sure the sharing option is chosen in xp. on the mac side, i typed in &quot;smb://my ip address/&lt;share&gt;&quot;, but i get a bad connection response. 
i would greatly appreciate it if anyone could please help me. 
thanks!
