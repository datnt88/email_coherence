that's weird. is this your laptop or are you some tech? the battery issues are easy to solve on laptops because there are so few parts at play. 
we have the wall unit or brick which we check out with the voltmeter then the mainboard, contacts and finally the battery. 
when you have a client that insists on it working you can nail the maximum repair fee with the cost of the mainboard, battery and your one hour shop fee.
