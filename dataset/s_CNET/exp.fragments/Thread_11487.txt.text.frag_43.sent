the victim machine in the demo was not previously connected to the access point, as you seem to imply. 
at the start of the video, the guy clearly says that the victim machine does not have to be previously associated with the access point or authenticated in any way. 
you're missing the point when you tell us not to randomly connect to an unknown ap. that's not the issue here at all.
