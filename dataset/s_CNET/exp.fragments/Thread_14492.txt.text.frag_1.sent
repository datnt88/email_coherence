i was wondering if it is possible to see dish network channels on a pc. i know that it is possible with the regular cable (like comcast) with a tv tuner card, but i am not sure whether it would be possible to do it via a dish receiver. 
can any1 help me? 
cause i was about to buy a tv tuner card and this just struck me. 
-thanks
