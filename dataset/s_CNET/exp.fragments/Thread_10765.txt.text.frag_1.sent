i am looking into upgrading my pc looking for a dual core system and be able to run todays games well it doesnt have to be cutting edge but still needs to look good and not be really expensive. 
i am all for building stuff its pretty fun but is it worth it? 
i see dual core pc's at walmart for around 500bux would it be more cost effective to buy one of these and add a pretty good video card to it and some more ram, rather than buying everything and putting it together. 
has anyone done this type of thing before? 
i relate it to cars yes i could spend 125 grand on a porsche turbo if i had the money or i could buy a new 30grand mustang and throw some nitrous and a supercharger on it that costs 5grand roughly you may give up some looks or some cornering ability but have roughly the same performance for alot less money. 
thanks for your time.
