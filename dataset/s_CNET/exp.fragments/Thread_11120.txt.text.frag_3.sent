hi: my unit is new, i called brother and an affiliated service unit and they told me that it must be turned on almost continuously. 
it doesn't make sense. 
and, i won't buy another hp model as hp is difficult to deal with and their solutions after a couple of years is to buy, buy, buy! 
by the way, what was the defect in your unit?
