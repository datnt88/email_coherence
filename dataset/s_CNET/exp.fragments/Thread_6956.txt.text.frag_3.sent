a couple things 1) don't get a microatx case because all the components will be close together, and there will be a lot of heat. 
get an atx mid tower 2) i'd get a better psu; i like the antec true power ii 550 watt for $80. 3) you forgot a video card 4) why the ide hard drives? 
5) why only 512mb of ram? 6) wait for conroe to come out; amd will lower the prices of thier dual-core cpus by about 50% 7) please change your formatting; leave lines between all the components, and just copy/paste the url in so that it will be displayed as a link. 
your whole post is a formatting disaster, making it very hard to read and understand.
