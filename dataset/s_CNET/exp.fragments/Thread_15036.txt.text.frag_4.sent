i'm going to share an article where the wifi router was not used. 
however it's so flighty and many have no grasp of networking so i must decline doing anything more than noting the article. 
here a router can be found for 20 bucks. 
so it's a personal choice if your time is worth that. 
-&gt; read good luck, bob
