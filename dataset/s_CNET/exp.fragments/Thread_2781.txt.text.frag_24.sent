here is a some advice other posters may not have touched upon. 
before you start your quest, backup your harddrive. 
make sure you have a static map to work on in a clear area and use a static clip. 
take your time inserting cards, memory modules and processors. 
one of the most difficult issues one might face is the installation of a processor fan. 
they can be tricky, be very patient here. 
don't put all of your boards into the motherboard right at the start. 
just put in the video card, the memory and the processor and test this. 
this will save time having to remove parts toisolate problems if any should arise on the first post. 
if you get no video on the first post, listen for the beeps and consult your motherboard manual. 
i'd usually advise first try clearing cmos before removing memory, video card, and/or processor. 
the one disadvantage you have is you probably don't have extra memory, processors or video cards lying around. 
in regards to your old cards, there is never a guarantee they will work. 
just like moving in the real world, you should consider if you really need a card. 
many new motherboards offer most of the amenities you'll need outside of decent video and sound. 
good luck you don't need an a+ by all means nor more than you need a plumber to unclog a toilet.

suggest you go to for research.
