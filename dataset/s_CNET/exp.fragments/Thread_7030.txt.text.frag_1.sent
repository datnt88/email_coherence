hi, wondering if anyone knows a tablet program that would allow one to write into a standard form text file questionaire that has pre-typed items then convert what is written into text? 
it's for work. 
example: (pre-typed) what are a few of your favorite colors? 
(in this space hoping to write below the text with a stylus): blue, green, red then what i write gets converted to text, in he proper position: (result) what are a few of your favorite colors? 
blue, green, red
