i can no longer boot from both my hard drives. 
the first error message said: intel boot agent: no boot filename received. 
i disabled the iba in my bios. 
now when i try to boot the message says:cannot read from drive due to hardware configuration problem. 
i tried changing disc order and boot device order in bios. 
i also tried disconnecting all drives except for the one i want,still no luck. the bios does not list the hard drive i want in boot device order, but it does list it in hard disc drives, and windows says both drives are healthy. 
any suggestions? 
i am on a new gateway with xp pro, my hard drives are from maxtor. 
i also have a cd drive and floppy. 
my motherboard is from intel. 
i also tried upgrading my bios from the gateway site. 
thanks.
