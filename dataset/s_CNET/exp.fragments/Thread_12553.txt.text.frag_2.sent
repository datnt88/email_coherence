you have a win 98 startup disk. 
i would boot from that and try to read from the drive. 
if so, it might be possible to recover some data while you can as it may be that the drive is in a failure process if not gone already. 
there are tools to repair the master boot record or reinstall system files. 
again, you need a startup or recovery disk. the &quot;fdisk&quot; utility on the startup disk, by using the /mbr switch, might accomplish this but i don't remember if the &quot;sys&quot; command works as it did with old dos originals. 
otherwise, you can try to reinstall windows from the cd without reformatting first. 
no guarantees but maybe worth a shot. 
good luck.
