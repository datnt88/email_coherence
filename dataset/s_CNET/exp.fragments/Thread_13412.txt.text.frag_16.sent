hi andrew, just wanted to say that prior to reading your question, i hadn't realized that this might be a problem for business owners. 
i live in manhattan, and used to frequently take my laptop and a dvd and go out to dinner by myself and watch a movie. 
now, however, i keep a list of local restaurants that provide wi-fi, and i patronize them so i can have dinner and stream a movie to my ipad from netflix . 
am i an inadvertent &quot;bandwidth leech?&quot; is streaming as much of a drain as downloading? 
i certainly don't want to cause problems for the restaurants' owners, but i patronize these establishments because they offer free wi-fi, often dining somewhere that wouldn't otherwise be my first choice. 
should i rethink this? 
thanks!
