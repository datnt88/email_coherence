i use a 60gb drive in a belkin enclosure. 
it has a fan and heat has never been an issue. 
i like seagate drives the best and find their recent switch to a 5 year warranty a good sign. 
recently amazon had a 160gb seagate external drive for $119.00 after rebate. the drive stood upright taking far less desk space than my current drive. 
i plan to watch for this offer and use it next time i see it. 
every seagate drive i buy has a $50 rebate and they process and get you your money in a timely manner every time. 
i have three seagate drives on the shelf. 
they will provide additional space or replacements in our five desktops.
