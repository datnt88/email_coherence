i collect dead parts in hope of a cheap repair for someone. 
when my pile of hard disks (years ago) was over 50 pounds and the likelyhood of scavenging a circuit board or cable to fix another was diminishing, i took the whole lot to some electronic flea market. the boxes were marked &quot;dead hard drives 2 bucks&quot; the units were sold out in 15 minutes. 
there's a lesson in there somewhere.
