inside there was something burn, not sure what(i havent looking much about lcd technology). 
thats what the repair man said and of course it will cost more than the monitor to repair so i just used my old 15&quot; and replace my other computer with my cousin's monitor. 
also, he mention it was cause by electricity problems so my parents bought surge arrest. 
over all, i suggest you buy another monitor and a surge protector(the power strip i had sucked).
