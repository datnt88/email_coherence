ask 10 people and you may well get 10 opinions. 
i decided years ago that i would never buy an hp pc, although i have several hp printers. 
in may i bought an hp 1020n, and within 2 weeks had also bought an hp scanner and my 2nd hp digital camera. 
i have had a few issues, all software related and due to the camera/scanner combo, but hp did a pretty good job of helping me straighten them out. 
there is a lot of basic and intro software, but i had the same thing with my last pc which was a pre-hp compaq. 
i just uninstalled the stuff i didn't want. 
if you go hp, make the system recovery dvd/cd set asap just in case.
