the speed reduction issue is not the problem i'm encountering though. 
i'm aware of that issue, and it is a cpu limitation anyway. is that the only issue you found related to using 4 sticks? 
the bios version is interesting. 
mine is f2, so it's definitely out of date. 
unfortunately i'm having problems updating it. 
@bios is giving write errrors every time when trying to update the flash memory with the new bios version. 
i tried v11 and v3, neither worked. 
not sure how to proceed from here.
