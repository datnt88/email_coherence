i recently was trying to upgrade to a newer video card on an old computer i have. 
i put it in but it turned out it wasnt compatible, at least so i think. 
while i was trying to get the new drivers to work i uninstalled the old intel graphics drivers on the computer. 
i then had to take out the old card but when i try to run the computer off the old the old intel graphics card i cant get a driver to install. 
i tried downloading a couple drivers, but im not 100% sure of what model the graphics controller is and when i try to isntall it it says that this driver cant be used with this device. the computer is a: x86 family 6 model 8 stepping 6 processor intel graphics controler windows 98 128mb ram any help i can get or a proper driver that will work wil be appreciated. 
thanks
