thanks for the advice, i will be more careful in the future. 
i think i figured out that somehow i am using one drive to boot from and using the other drive's system resources, which is why i need both drives to boot up and no matter the configuration, it always boots to the same drive. 
basically, i am using the drives in conjunction. 
in disc management, it lists one drive as healthy(boot) and the other drive as healthy(system). 
i believe the second drive should read: healthy(active). 
any ideas on how i can make both drives able to boot independently of each other?
