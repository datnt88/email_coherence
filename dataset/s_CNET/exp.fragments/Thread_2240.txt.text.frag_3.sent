i believe the default setting for sleep mode on the macbooks is to also put the hdd to sleep when possible. 
so, once the laptop has gone into sleep mode, the hdd is no longer spinning and everything is basically in a state of limbo. 
you should have no concerns about the &quot;fragility&quot; of the hdd, although they are smaller and appear less robust than their full sized counterparts, they are designed to withstand a little more &quot;abuse&quot; than a drive that will be forever fixed in a permanent position. 
i have an old ibook that sleeps for 80% of the time, with the drive shut down, it's about 7 years old and has the original drive. 
on the subject of leaving the machine plugged into the wall, not a problem. the power management circuit will ensure that a float charge will be applied to the battery, just to keep it tickled up, and push the rest of the power past the battery to the inner sanctum. 
it is a good idea to discharge the battery fully, once in a while (see the manual) and then plug it back in again. 
just run it until it shuts itself down. 
hope this helps p
