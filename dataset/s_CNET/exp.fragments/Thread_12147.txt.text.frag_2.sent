get reviews of said notebooks and use the video benchmarks to compare. 
pros for shared memory graphics: - less power required. 
- more time on battery (same size battery!) - less heat. 
- cheaper. 
cons for same. 
- gamers loathe such. 
- 3d performance pales to dedicated video memory and gpu. 
- some cpu performance loss as video memory access causes the cpu to &quot;wait.&quot; - more money. 
hope this helps.
