a tv connection has simpler demands for operation than a pc. at least it should be when compared to each other. the link i provide should give a clue. 
what may happen is the file system or overall partitioning is done so the tv sees it while a pc expects as it wants the files and needs the ability to retrieve but show access to whatever needs are required at a higher level. 
you may need a linux type access to mount the ext. 
hd and see if you can xfer the data, then reformat the hd as needed.
