i think it would probably be a good idea if i backed up my music, photos, and documents from my laptop just in case but this would be my first time so i'm not sure where to start. 
i'm of course interested in time machine which seems to be pretty straight forward but i don't want to buy a $200 time capsule from apple. 
i really don't think i need alot of space, i only want one copy of everything, i don't really care about what everything looked like last week or the week before. 
is there a way you can have time machine back up online? 
what should i get for a hard drive? 
i would really rather it be wireless if possible. 
please tell me you're opinion and keep it simple since i'm not to tech-saavy.
