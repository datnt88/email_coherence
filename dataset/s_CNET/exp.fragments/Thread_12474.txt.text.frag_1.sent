hello! i'm having a bit of a problem. 
work gave me an old dinosaur of a laptop running windows 2000 and no in-built wireless! 
i got hold of a belkin f5d7001 usb stick and installed it onto the pc. the drivers have installed fine, when i plug in the usb it detects perfectly and i can see it in in my devices and as lan 2 in the network connections. 
problem is that the belkin wireless utility doesn't want to load. 
it wasn't present in the taskbar as i would have expected, so when trying to double click the icon on the desktop... nothing! 
as the drivers appear to be loaded fine... is there any generic wireless utility i can use to detect available networks and connect? 
(like windows xp does?) thanks!
