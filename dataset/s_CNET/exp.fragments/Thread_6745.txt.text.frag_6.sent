after reading your post i have come to the conclusion maybe the system doesn't have enough juice pumping in; in other words more watts. 
i could be wrong but if starting the computer and then shutting down like that it sound like you make need to buy a power supply with more watts. the other thing that i noticed was that the temp. 
was high but according to you, the right amount of thermal paste was applied and the fan was installed correctly, if all that was correct consider this the system needs power like you need food to make atp for ur cells' activities, but anyways consider more wattts. 
and also maybe something was damaged by static shock just something to think about.
