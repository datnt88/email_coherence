in the bios it says device id: unknown. 
so apparently it can tell that something is there, but can't communicate with the drive? 
i may try the external cable today, since i have to head to down to best buy anyways. 
also, powering off and removing all the cables didn't do anything. 
for the record, the drive is a seagate barracuda 1tb
