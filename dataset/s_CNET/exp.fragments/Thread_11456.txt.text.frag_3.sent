flat out some hds are very quiet and what noise you do hear are &quot;whirrr&quot; or slight &quot;ac-changs&quot; during seeks, but overall still very low. 
during intense operation it maybe slightly noisier. 
take this all with a grain of salt, because sometimes what you really hear is the &quot;resonance&quot; that metal-to-metal contact makes when too tighten or loose mounting. 
this is common in desktop operation to have some noise. 
however, you gave &quot;no details&quot; of your setup, so any answer could vary. 
if it now more noisier than when you 1st had it installed, then it maybe r/w to an area of the hd which allows more resonance to travel easier but it still falls into wear&tear of operation, expect some noise. 
also, don't mistake hd for fan noise, that can happen too.
