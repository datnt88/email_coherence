i'm looking for a new power supply for my pc, and i've found loads of psu's that have one fan at the back and one at the top. the problem is that i only have a hole in my case for a fan at the back. 
would i be able to have a fan at the top of the case with no hole? 
or will it just blow hot air around and be pointless to buy? 
any help is much appreciated.
