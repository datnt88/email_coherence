i bought a gm5632e a little over a month ago from bestbuy. 
aside from the headache setting up the pc to dual boot xp and vista, it had run good for sev weeks. 
all of a sudden today i notice a fan inside the case get louder for a sec than reboots every hour within a min like clockwork. 
after reading this thread and trying everything that was suggested i went to gateway website and started a chat with a tech option. 
they had me goto msconfig and disable all startups, and then goto power options and asked me to use never for all. 
basically to not turn off monitor and harddisks ever. the only 1 that needed changed was monitor from 20 mins to never. 
she asked me to restart. 
after that she said to come back and ask for her after a few hours if it persisted. 
before i left the chat.i 
asked her why she asked me to make them changes and what was the underlining cause if she knew? 
after several mins without a response , i asked if she was still there. 
i seen notification of her typing then it disapeared and no response. 
after at least 6 or 7 mins later she finally answered with, i noticed a conflict with your software and your hardware. 
that`s all she said. 
so i said sorry but,how did you determine that? 
lol i mean i told her what the problem was and she immediatelyinstructed me to do the 2 changes. 
well the pc hasnt restarted in over 4+ hours as of yet. the only startups i had checked in the first place was for my razor mouse,and my nvidia card. 
so what that could have did is beyond me. 
so were left with auto shut off of the monitor? 
every hour when it restarted i was on the internet reading articles. 
my screensaver is set to 5 mins and it never came up so i wasnt idle for sure. 
and this was happening on the xp side. 
vista is installed but havent booted into that side in weeks. 
good luck all gateway roxxxxxxxx
