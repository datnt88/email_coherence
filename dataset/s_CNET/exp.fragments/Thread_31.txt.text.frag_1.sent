actually this is the second modem i've tried to put in this machine (an acer aspire). 
both times i get the same thing, &quot;not digitally signed&quot; &quot;device cannot start error 10&quot;. 
i have tried installing in both pci slots, both com ports, a diamond and a u.s. robotics modems. 
i've installed the driver from the cd and installed a downloaded driver from the usr site. 
nothing works. 
both modems claim on the box to be xp compatible, but i cannot find a modem in any store with the &quot;official&quot; xp logo on it. 
i have installed several modems in other computers before without a problem. 
i have not yet called the support number (i hate that) and i do have the option of having the tech people at my wife's work do it (she works for a large computer reseller) but it is killing me that i can't get this thing to work. 
it's just a modem for gosh sakes! 
any ideas? 
thanks.
