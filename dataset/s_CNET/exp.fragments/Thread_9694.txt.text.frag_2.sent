i certainly hope when you say, &quot;disconnect and reconnect&quot; you're talking the cable from card to monitor. 
if not and you actually unplug the card when &quot;on&quot;, you probably did damage. 
if the cable, make sure to inspect the pins aren't bent or pushed-in. 
otherwise, get a new card but be prepared for a possible mtrbd. 
replacement too, if you're not lucky. 
at least that's what you post appears to me.
