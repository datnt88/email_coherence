i currently have belkin n+ router that drops the signal every 40s. 
all computers have this. 
they stay connected but can not navigate the internet. 
browsing the web i see other people have this problem. 
whatever. 
i want a router that works. 
decent speeds and reliable. 
definitely not a belkin. 
any suggestions?
