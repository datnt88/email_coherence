hi , i have a desktop pc with intel dual core 2.8 ghz processor , a motherboard with ati xpress 200 chipset . the computer has 2 gb of ddr2 667 memory. 
i want to add a graphic card to the configuration . 
now my question is if i add a graphic card of the nvida 2 series like the 240 , will the graphic card confict with the configuration because of the ati xpress 200 chipset ? is it best to stick with the ati brand of gpus ? 
actually a few years ago , we were assembling a pc with core 2 duo e6600 processor , intel motherboard with 965 chipset , 4 gb of ddr2 ram and a 8400 gt graphic card . 
there was a conflict between the graphic card and the intel 965 chipset motherboard . the motherboard and the graphic card was sent to their respective support centers , but it was said they were working fine ( we suspected that either mobo or g-card was having a problem ) . 
finally the problem was sorted out by swapping the intel 965 mobo with a xfx nforce chipset mobo , and till date the configuration works like a charm . 
so my question is , will i be facing any compatibility issues if i pair a nvidia gpc card with a ati xpress chipset motherboard ? 
or is it is best to stick to a ati gpu card with a ati xpress 200 chipset ? 
thanks for reading sam
