as described in first post, this was a working pc until a few weeks ago. 
when you say &quot;it's&quot; defective, what are you referring to? 
as far as the setup, it was working fine until this message appeared. 
i have tested the following: 1) both hard drives are recognized in another pc and windows xp boots correctly. 
2) i tried reconnecting the hard drives using a new sata cable and that didn't make a difference. 
i am thinking that maybe the sata controller went bad? at this point i am following up on the warranty for the mother board. 
thanks!
