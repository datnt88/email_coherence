let me detail the problem a bit further... my computer has been suffering from an ongoing 'random blue screen' problem. 
when too many applications are running it'll just show a blue screen and i'll have to restart. 
these are the hardware solutions i've tried so far: replacing graphics-card/motherboard/processor installing new case/heatsink fans reformatted hard-drive i was told that it was unlikely to be the ram so only yesterday did i try using only one of the 2*256 sdram sticks that i have. 
i left the computer on for the whole night with just the one stick of ram and it worked absolutely fine with no problems. 
i assumed that the other stick of ram was causing the problem (since it worked fine without it), but i've been running the computer with no problems today with what i believed was the dodgy ram! 
i've been monitoring things vigorously and it now appears the computer only works error-free when running with a free ram slot. 
can anyone shed any light on this at all? 
i'm very confused!
