it seemed like magic to some but we had no interest in putting a printer on a print server or &quot;share&quot; or other solution because the printer drivers would kill our support staff and budget. 
here's how we solved it. 
we created a network share and if you put a .pdf 
file there it gets printed then deleted from that directory. 
this is not an offer to write in detail about the batch file that runs this print job but to share we knew the pitfalls of attempting a printer share.
