about the clock stability. 
what bios setting do you choose for spread spectrum? 
if you don't know then dismiss that section and move on. 
about the wdm capture. 
where is that capture device? 
if you don't know, ignore that section. 
about directx install. 
see if dxbuster can clean it out and try again.
