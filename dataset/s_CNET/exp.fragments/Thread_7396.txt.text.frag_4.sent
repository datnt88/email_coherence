imagine one's surprise? 
another posted here installed some microsoft windows update and immediately began to have issues. 
they had taken the offer for a driver. 
they didn't think much of that, so we had to go a few rounds and eventually they called emachines. the driver was rolled back. 
this may not be your issue, but not unheard of.
