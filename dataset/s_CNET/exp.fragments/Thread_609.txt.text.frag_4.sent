i haven't found to my knowledge, ram voltage to be a common issue. 
while its very important to have stable voltage coming from the psu, ram voltage isn't that demanding. 
from memory, ddr is 2.5v, ddr2 is 1.8v and when it comes ddr3 will be 1.2v to 1.5v. the only time you have a problem with ram voltage is in *overclocking* where more voltage is needed to help stabilze ram and even that's in .1 increments. 
unless the intel965 chipset is some freaky varmit, at least i haven't heard of any bad press.
