it appears you did this from your pc behind your router. 
unless you pay for it you will only get a single ip from your isp. that is your 71.56.46.184 address. 
since there is only 1 ip address the device you plug into the modem or other device the isp uses gets this ip. if you run without a router your pc will directly get the ip. when you use a router the router pretends all the machines at your location come from the same address. 
in effect your machine has 2 addresses. 
the 192.168.1.102 is your &quot;fake&quot; address. 
these are actually called private addresses and are used to reduce the actual number of ip used.
