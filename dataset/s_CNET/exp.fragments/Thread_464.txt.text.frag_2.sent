while vivo (video-in, video-out) may look promising to connect your ps2 to said pc to play your game, many dis the display quality since you don't get much better than tv pixels. 
also it may not be &quot;real-time&quot; or lag free enough. 
i will share that my simpler choices of pc tv/capture cards are near realtime (games hate lag) and cost about 49 or less bucks.
