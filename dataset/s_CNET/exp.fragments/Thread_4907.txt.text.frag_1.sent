hi i just ordered a new computer, and was curious if i would be able to add my old video card to the system and have both cards work together. 
i have found a fair amount of conflicting information about it and am not clever enough to know of my own intuition. the new system comes with a nvidia geforce 9800 gt over-clocked video card that i believe fits into a pci-e x16 slot. the older card is a pny xlr8 geforce 8800 gt 512mb, and made for just a normal pci-e slot. is it possible to make these two work together, or am i wasting my time on a foolish pursuit?
