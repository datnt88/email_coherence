thanks for the recommendation. 
however, i'd still like to know if it is a significant upgrade to go from my nvidia geforce fx 5200 to an ati radeon 9800 pro. 
are there any quantitative resources on the internet that compare how good video cards are stacked up against each other? 
again, any help is appreciated.
