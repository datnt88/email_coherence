the house we're moving into will only be temporary as we're transitioning through states and only need somewhere to stay or a few weeks after the closing of our house. 
we're not staying at the place long enough to install internet service. 
we'd prefer to just search for another signal in the area. 
i've stayed there before and have used other signals in the area but the signals aren't strong enough. 
and now that there will be 3 of us with laptops, the signal needs to be strong so that we can all pick one up. 
know what i mean? 
what do you suggest? 
or do you still think its worth it to have a service installed for the 1 month?
