personally i dont care for gateways that much. 
my friend had a couple and i wasnt impressed with the machine given the price. 
i recently purchased an hp and have had problems with it as well. 
my so called warranty isnt worth anything since my dvd+- died on me and the experts at their india &quot;service center&quot; run me around in circles for hours until i finally have given up. 
heard the same thing about other major brands. 
basically for the money i would go with a dell/ibm (if they still have em) low cost server and purchase the extras seperately or get a year old workstation with dual processor capability and jack it up. 
since most of the service/call centers have moved overseas i wouldnt put much hope in getting something fixed if it breaks &quot;under warranty&quot;. 
definitely would not purchase an hp but i am sure others have had better experiences.
