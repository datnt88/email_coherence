thanks for the additional background dick. 
in terms on multiple ip adresses i was refering to addresses for the machines on my home network. 
after working fine for 3 years with 2 - 3 pcs and a wap, one day i could reliably only get a single ip address for a specifc machine. 
even connecting each machine directly to the modem without going through a hub made no difference. 
very weird. 
verizon's solution was to wipe and start over:) i did see for a long time that my ip addresses expired every 15 minutes. 
today they expire at 2 hours. 
windows media connect only works within specified address ranges and the address i typically get from verizon falls outside of any of those ranges.
