i hooked up my lcd to my new gateway labtop via vga. the cable is from radio shack. 
on the box it reads (1.8)-vga/super vga monitor. 
on the vable itself it reads 2919 80 degrees 30v space shuttle-c low voltage cable. 
i connected audio via 1/8&quot; stereo miniplug audio cable. the samsung series 3 330 lcd tv says &quot;no signal&quot; when i select input_tv. 
what could be the problem?
