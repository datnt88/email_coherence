i have 4 256mb modules installed, and still just the initial dos boot screen says 512 ok and windows system info says 1gb ok. the error reading cannot read memory location is random, never occuring repeatedly. 
my system has been running slower recently too. 
i cleaned up the hard drive and defragged, but problem persists.
