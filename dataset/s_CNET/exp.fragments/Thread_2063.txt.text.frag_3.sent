by up grading the pc you have or working with some old computers first. 
there's more to this then you think. 
put it together isn't hard but getting components to all work together is far more difficult then one might imagine. 
there are many issues with compatibility. 
if you still want to proceed, start with the mother board, everything plugs into it. the cpu socket on the mother board is very important, you want one that will support as many cpus as possible. 
i'd suggest you stick with the atx form factor for your case and mother board selection. 
then select a cpu. 
followed by video card, hard drives and ram. 
finishing up with the rest. 
build upgrade ability into your pc. this thread is untracked
