i was originally hoping to use firewire, since i thought it would be easier. 
to be honest, the simpler the setup the better. 
i consider my self pretty knowledgeable about computers, but when it comes to networking, nothing seems to work for me. is there any simpler way? 
perhaps i could connect my mac to both networks?
