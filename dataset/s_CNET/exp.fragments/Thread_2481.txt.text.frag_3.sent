i have the same cpu and cpu-z recognizes it correctly. 
try downloading the latest version of cpu-z or just doing a fresh install. 
look under the system info in xp, if it says xp3200+ then i wouldn't be concerned about it. 
i have a question though for you. 
i have a similarly configured system: amd athlon xp 3200+ 2x512mb pc3200 ati x1300pro 256mb 160gb hd 7200rpm what kind of games do you play? 
do you experience any lag while playing half-life 2 due to the cpu? 
sometimes i get some studdering and freezes while running. 
shutting down background apps helps quite a bit, but occasionally i still get some problems. 
i was wondering if it was due to the low clockspeed at 2.2ghz.
