pentium d series 8xx and 9xx are dual core processors based on the older netburst architecture. 
&quot;core duo&quot; is the name intel uses for dual core processors based on the newer &quot;core&quot; architecture which are more energy efficient than pentium d. core 2 duo is an enhancement of core duo. 
forget freq comparisons between architectures. 
a lower freq design with shorter pipelines and more accurate caches can be faster than a higher freq older chip, for targeted workloads (&quot;mileage may vary&quot; as the ads always say). 
you are stressing over details (accountant or irs auditor eh?) of the system. 
a more reassuring approach may be to ask corporate professionals in your field what they are using. 
don't be surprised if they are still on older systems because upgrade cycles are approx 3 yrs and not many companies have adopted core duo or core 2 duo yet in desktops. 
core duo desktops are not that common and core 2 duo desktops are just appearing on the market. 
because of their energy efficeincy these cpus are more popular in notebooks. 
now if what you are looking for is the latest toy...that's another matter.
