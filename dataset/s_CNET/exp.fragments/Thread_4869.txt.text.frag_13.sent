it looks good. 
ram, actually, isn't &quot;for&quot; a certain brand. 
ram will work as long as it has the same subsystem (ddr2, ddr3, etc) in any system. 
speeds don't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo (spd) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs. 
looks nice from my end.
