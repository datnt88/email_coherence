this may sound very dumb but i think i will just exonerate myself for asking this by claiming that i'm a novice. 
so routers have actually been programmed to automatically &quot;unwrap&quot; every single data frame that it receives so as to read the ip address &quot;underneath&quot; it (or should i say &quot;above&quot; since the network layer is on top) and then re-encapsulate them and send them away? 
so i think the reason for the mac address (data link layer) being necessary even though the ip addresses themselves are already unique is because when relaying a message from point a to point b to point c, and that point a and point c are actually not in direct contact (viz cannot communicate node to node) and must go through point b so must use the mac address to make sure the message has gone to the correct middleman/men. 
i think i've got it!! but maybe if we're deploying ipv6, where every networking hardware can be allocated its unique ip address, then having this mac address may not be really necessary? 
i mean theoretically we can modify the protocol to something like this: source ip address destination ip address ip address on the next relay &lt;-- this plays the role of mac address but maybe that'd be too much work.
