thanks for your time and efforts , but the issue with nvidia 8400 and intel 965 is history . 
i want to know if you have encountered any issues with the nvidia 240 gpu and ati xpress 200 chipset . 
i have configured pcs with intel g31 and g41 chipsets as well as the x58 chipset ( intel x58bp server board ) with nvidia gpus cards ; no issues at all . 
i am just asking because i have no experience with the ati xpress 200 chipset . 
thanks sam
