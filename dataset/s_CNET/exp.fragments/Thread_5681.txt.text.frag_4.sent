here's the deal: 1) new system will accept old hd with new hd as boot drive, you can then swap data as required(but can be iffy) 2) the old hd(old os) can't be used as main drive in new system w/o losing data and unless preparing it for proper use 3) the xp os won't allow usage as in step 2, and is illegal to use any oem os besides the intended system or dell in this case 4) install old hd in usb enclosure and mount that way to access data 5) if you donate old system with hd, then erase completely using pgms. 
like killdisk, dban, or hd eraser(google for them) tada -----willy
