i have two computers, both with xp sp3, one home, the other pro, and a router. the xp home computer is connected directly with an ethernet cable to the router, the xp pro is connected to the router through ethernet over the a.c. supply through two of those whatever you call them &quot;adapters&quot;. both computers connect to the internet ok but they apparently can't see each other - the network which i thought i had set up doesn't appear in my network places, nor can the xp pro machine use the printer which is connected to a usb port on the xp home one. 
when i try to print something from the pro machine, the printer's (epson) window opens up, telling me that the &quot;printer is not ready to print&quot;. 
i may have overlooked something, or perhaps the various instructions which i have read have not mentioned something which they should have. 
can anyone suggest a reliable and complete set of instructions which i can consult?
