strange, but i popped in my stargate blu-ray disc today and it plays fine. 
willy wonka used to play fine, too, but now my system can't see the disk. 
why would it see other blu-ray discs, but not a disc that had played once with ease? 
if i can't get a workable answer, i'll have to buy a fifty dollar lg disc player.
