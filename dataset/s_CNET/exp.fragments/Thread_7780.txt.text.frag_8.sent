i fixed two earlier dells by replacing the ps since it was having trouble recognizing the drives. 
be very careful with the new dell systems as they have a dell proprietary (non-standard) atx design. 
this means that pin 1 and 3 have ground on them where the standard atx has +5 volts and a couple other pin mismatches. 
see: warning: if you hook a standard atx up you will blow the board.
