i have been trying for the past couple of days to network a couple of pc's. 
a)win xp - b)win nt. i have b running through a netgear hub where i have a laser copier as well. 
the thing is that the laser copier is identified in the network but the win nt machine is not. 
i tried to ping one machine from the other and no luck. 
they seem to not see each other on the network. 
however when i enter the ip address of the nt machine in the xp one a message flags instantly on both machines, they can't shared the same ip. 
i am not a wizard at all on networking, to my disgrace, but if they are not seeing each other on the network why is this message coming up in both machines simultaneously? 
now i realize that in the nt machine there are two protocols installed: tcp/ip & netbui while xp does not carry netbui anymore. 
could this be the bloody reason why xp is not picking up this machine on the network? 
i have tried a million things that have come to my mind to no luck. 
what suggestions come to your mind guys? 
please enlighten me... gelson
