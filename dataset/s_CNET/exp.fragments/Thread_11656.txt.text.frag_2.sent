&quot;the board will support pc 3200 memory, if i would go to 512m pc3200, how much improved performance coulld i expect.&quot; almost none. 
the board runs at the slower speed of the slower sticks. 
you can sift through to see that even from pc2700 to pc3200 it will be doubtful you could tell any real difference except in a benchmark.
