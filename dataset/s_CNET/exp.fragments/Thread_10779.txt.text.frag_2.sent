if so, did you turn it off in the bios? 
or, if you had a previous card, did you remove it in device manager, and uninstall any software associated with it? 
assuming you did these, here's another thing. 
some hardware drivers do that. 
when you put in the disc, don't let it &quot;auto-run&quot;. open it manually and install from there. 
that's happened to me more than once. 
may take more than one try to get it right. 
good luck.
