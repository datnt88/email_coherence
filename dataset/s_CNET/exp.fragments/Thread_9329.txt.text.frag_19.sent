personal and confidential i appreciate your help. 
some of it was very helpful and you did it in a nice way. 
i do not want to steal a person's connection. 
this is why i am asking so many questions-so i am informed. 
some people think i need to go slower but after 9 months and the 4th notebook i will actually have in my hands, my job and myself cannot wait to go any slower. 
when i had the thinkpad t61 at home, i used it for about a week. 
a manager there who helped me a lot via e-mail said keep it, use it, try it, ask questions, and i will override the restocking fee if it does not work out. 
when i clicked the wireless icon a graph of sorts came up. 
it showed about 4 or 5 connections and how far they were from me. 
i probably mis-read the distance but that is not the point. 
when i connected to one there was another screen that gave me all kinds of options and one was to make the connection more secure. 
i could have selected this but i was only on there to register my notebook because i did not have an internet connection at that time. 
so that is what i meant. 
if it added more security to my connection i have no idea but that is what it offered. 
for the people who are requesting i cancel the order and go slow, i will say i have been researching this for 9 months. 
i have accumulated so much info, asked so many questions, and tried 4 notebooks (not counting the mac) so i think i am ready. the problem is that i have never had a mac so i have questions. 
even if i did have a mac i would still have questions. 
i appreciate the first post with all the links. 
i wish i had the kind of life where i could go through all of them. 
however, a forum like this would seem to me to be a great place to go to get specific questions answered. 
in regards to 2 ways to connect to the internet (dsl and cable) i think i am getting it. 
i would have said there are 3 ways to connect to the internet: 1. cable by way of usb/ethernet or some other cable, and 2 dsl, which is through your phone line, and 3. wireless that comes into your house as either 1 or 2 but the cable stops at a router. 
it is at this router where the internet signal becomes wireless and is accepted by your computer. 
or something to this affect. 
there is nothing &quot;magical&quot; about the extreme base station; it just allows a cable internet connection to be turned into a wireless connection. 
it was my misunderstanding of how a wireless connection worked but it all seems common sense now. 
and your comment about the shipping option, i think you misunderstood me. 
i did pick a different address since my billing address is a po box. 
however, i had no idea they would send one order in 5-6 shipments at various time, weeks apart. 
i did not think that through. 
lenovo sent it all as one. 
i even had the option to check 'wait for all accessories before shipping&quot;. 
i can understand some things come from various companies but i thought it was bad that it was not made clear to me upon checkout that this order would be sent as 5 separate shipments. 
anyway, i got that sorted out. 
i found a fedex/apple signature release form. 
i asked that they put the shipments in my back door and wow, they did. 
so i have all the accessories and will just be patient until the notebook arrives. 
however, i think if my posts bother someone, i would suggest not to answer or get involved with it unless you want to get upset by someone's questions. 
just because someone felt a need to spend an hour typing links and addresses does not mean that i need to cancel my order and go slow. 
i told you i appreciated the info very much but i did not say that i would not post a question again. 
my additional questions do not have any reflection on you or your post. 
i actually thought it to be very helpful and have printed out some info from the sites you mentioned.
