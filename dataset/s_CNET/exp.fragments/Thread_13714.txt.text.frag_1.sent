help! no ping responses in simple 2-node mac&lt;-&gt;pc wired lan i've been trying for weeks , but i just cannot get even the simplest ethernet two-node lan working under mac os 8.6 (or 8.5.x either) and windows xp home sp2. 
this is a direct, wired ethernet lan with only two nodes. 
there is no router or gateway present, and internet connection sharing is not desired. 
i'm using miramar's pc maclan v 8 software for intercompatible file sharing. 
current problem: no pings get responses in either direction from either side. 
on the mac side: direct ethernet connection to pc via d-link 10/100 switch all link and activity lights on switch flash in reponse to ping, and all show speed is 100, full duplex ip address hard, manually assigned to ethernet nic: 192.168.0.4 / 255.255.255.0 correctly formatted ot hosts file used for all local lan addresses, no dns no gateway or dns ip addresses associated with that nic/connection no routers present no direct connection to modem, broadband or otherwise. 
self-pings by both name and ip address are fine. 
all pings to the pc fail (timeout without any response). 
on the pc side: windows xp home sp2 direct ethernet connection to mac via d-link 10/100 switch all link and activity lights on switch flash in reponse to ping, and all show speed is 100, full duplex ip address hard, manually assigned to ethernet nic: 192.168.0.2 / 255.255.255.0 hosts file used for all local lan addresses, no dns no gateway or dns ip addresses associated with that nic/connection no routers present no direct connection to modem, broadband or otherwise. 
xp's tray and related displays show nic is active and connected. 
self-pings by both name and ip address are fine. 
all pings to the mac fail (timeout without any response). 
mac hardware configuration: power computing powerbase ppc macintosh with ata disks and 3 pci slots, running mac os 8.6 and open transport 2.0.3. 
nic is daynaport 10/100 pci ethernet card. 
i've tried it on two different ethernet hubs, and it's currently connected to my windows xp pc via a d-link 10/100 switch. the latest driver compatible with macos 8.6 is installed and running and reports no error. 
and i know the pci slot in question is working (it worked fine with a scsi hba there). 
now, here's a possibly telling but puzzling fact: on the windows side, there is a display showing the connection status and other details of the ethernet nic connection, and it consistently shows that zero packets have been recieved. 
however, when i ping the pc from the mac (mac -&gt; pc), the count of packets the pc has sent increments for each ping! 
unfortunately, the mac still reports all pings have failed. 
i desperately need help, please.
