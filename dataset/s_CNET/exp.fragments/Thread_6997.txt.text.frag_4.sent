1. drivers. 
while some claim they have the latest the only way i can tell is if the owner reveals make/model of machine and the motherboard and more driver versions. 
2. a bum usb cable. 
try another. 
3. a port that is not really usb 2.0 4. a port that has failed. 
wd should not help. 
better than 99% of the time it's the machine at fault and not their product. 
no one has cracked the problem of how to repair our machines cheaply enough to not have to charge for it. 
if you feel wd should perform the repair then what can be said. 
but if it never works, return is as defective.
