i have a cisco/linksys ea4500 that supports wireless-n with simultaneous dual-band 2.4 + 5 ghz as my main router. 
i would like to add an additional router to extend the range of my network using this article as a guide: how sophisticated of a second router do i need? 
do i need one with wireless-n with simultaneous dual-band 2.4 + 5 ghz? 
my main router in use now covers the whole house effectively. 
i am just installing the second router in order to have wired ethernet ports in another location. 
i figured if i am doing this, i might as well improve the wireless signal around this second location (the basement). 
any recommendations for this second router?
