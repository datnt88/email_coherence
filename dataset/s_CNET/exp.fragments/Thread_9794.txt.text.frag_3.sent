right now i have my one desktop going to the cable modem so that i can get internet access. 
for some reason my internet stopped working going through the wireless. 
after reading your what you said i am now thinking that there is something wrong with my router. 
since i hooked my desktop to the modem i can not also print anymore from my printer. the printer was going to the router. 
i have an officejet 6310 printer and my desktop that i have hooked up is an hp pavilion model 744v, amd athlon xp, 2.133ghz, 512 mb, 60gb32mb sd ddr sdram. the other desktop which i have not hooked up is a dell dimension 4300s, pentium 4, windows xp and that is all it says. 
how can i tell if there is something wrong with my wireless router? 
i don't know how to do that. 
thanks for all your help.
