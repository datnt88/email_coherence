do you have signs posted in your pub that explain your expectations, or limits, on usage of your pub's wi-fi hot spot? 
if not, that is the first place to start. 
if you do have usage limits posted and some of your customers ignore them, that's one thing. 
on the other hand, if you do not have limits posted, i don't think you are being fair to the customers you are calling &quot;bad guys.&quot; most people expect that a free wi-fi hot spot is just that, and that use is unrestricted. 
a very large percentage of customers at starbucks, and other establishments that feature wi-fi, appear to use it constantly, the entire time they are there. 
i've asked managers if they have a problem with freeloaders and whether having wi-fi is profitable, because i am curious about business practices. 
they all say that it draws a lot of business and is very profitable overall. 
you are in a business that typically has a high profit margin. 
you may want to analyze your numbers before you make changes that could alienate customers.
