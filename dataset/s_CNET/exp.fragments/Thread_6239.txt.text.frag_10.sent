if your using one of those monitor progs a good dose of skepticism will come in handy. 
i recall using one of those monitor tools that came from the mobo maker......the readings were nutty. 
if the mobo maker can't figure out how to get that info from &quot;their&quot; own board what chance does a third party tool have?
