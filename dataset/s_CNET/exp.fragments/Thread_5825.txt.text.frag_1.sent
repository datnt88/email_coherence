hi i'm looking to upgrade my power supply in my sony pcv-r14g so i can upgrade the graphics card. the problem that i have is finding a low profile power supply of minimum 400wts. 
i think sony makes things difficult so you cant upgrade and have to buy a new computer.i 
tried circuitcity, best buy and compusa and they dont have low profile power supplies. 
can anyone help me? 
thank you
