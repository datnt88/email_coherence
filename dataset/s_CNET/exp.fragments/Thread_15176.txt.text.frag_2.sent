is your computer running in safe mode? 
what os do you have? 
if you use win 98 or 98 se right click on my computer icon top left corner, then click on properties then click on peformance. 
if your in safe mode it should tell you. 
if that`s not it try reinstalling your video drivers you might also check in the control panel to see if their is a conflict. 
left click on my computer,then control panel,then system then device manager,should show a yellow ! 
or a red x if theres a problem. 
good luck.
