it is more important to have the correct monitor than the video card. 
you must remember that what you see on your monitor is not exactly how it will appear printed. 
you can feasibly get by with any cheap video card. 
i think that your needs should be met within the $150.00 us range. 
try a nvidia 5700 le or ati 9800 series card.
