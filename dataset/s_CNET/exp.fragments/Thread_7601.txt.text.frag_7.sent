however i believe that i can arrive at the answer. the question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an atx tower, thus always a standby voltage? 
i now realize that it could not have such. 
it seems that if it did and the battery slowly reuced it's voltage the standby source would get into a never never region, where digital logic would do many unplanned events flicking back and forth it's ones and zeros.
