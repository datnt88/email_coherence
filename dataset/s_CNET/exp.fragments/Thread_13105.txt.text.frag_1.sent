i went to turn on my computer the other day and when it was booting nothing came on my screen....i immediately thought it was a graphics card issue. 
when i looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything. 
i have an 1.1 gig athlon...any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks
