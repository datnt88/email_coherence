as a novice enthusiast, i began to become more and more frustrated with trying to upgrade/mod my oem sony vaio pc. a couple weeks ago, after a &quot;few&quot; drinks, i hit the newegg website, and ordered the parts for my first custom machine. 
here it is: evga nforce 680i sli mainboard q6600 @ 3.15 ghz zalman 9700 led 2gb corsair dominator @ 1166 mhz 2x evga geforce 8800 gtx 2x 160gb wd raptor (raid 0) 1tb hitachi deskstar quad silencer 750w psu antec nine hundred case windows vista ultimate this machine is a beast! the build went flawlessly, although it took several hours to put everything together. 
the antec nine hundred is great, however, i will probably move everthing into a full tower case in a couple months - very little room to work with. 
overclocking the cpu and memory was a breeze. 
unfortunately, the q6600 (b3 stepping) started blowing chunks above 3.2 ghz. 
from what i've read, every processor overclocks differently, and i'm satisfied with the results. 
as for the sony, it's attached to my home network and being used for miscellaneous backups and file transfers.
