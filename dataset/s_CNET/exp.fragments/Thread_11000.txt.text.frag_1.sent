we own a business that tapes auditions for actors. 
we tape on a canon vixia hf-10 onto an sd card and the format is avchd. 
i am looking for a low cost way to take the chip out, put it into a netbook, view them, and then upload the videos they want to our secure server. 
no need to edit the clips. 
after scouring online, i discovered the new lenovo s12 comes equipped with the ion nvidia graphics engine. 
is that the best option? 
or will an asus eee be able to handle that? 
i am a mac person, so i know nothing about windows based machines. 
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
