i don't have an answer for you but a few coments. 
we have just installed about 400 pc's with microsoft optical mice 1.0a. 
they all have similiar problems as you describe. 
occaisionally a small movement of the mouse causes a big move in the pointer on the screen. 
we have tried the differenet settings and mousepads too but the thing that solves the problem is switching to a logitech mouse - problem disapears
