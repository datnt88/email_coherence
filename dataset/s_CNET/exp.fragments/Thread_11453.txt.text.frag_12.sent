i am having trouble too, i can get the card to see my net work (wep) but it keeps say wrong password. 
i have 4 xp windows machines, that work with the same password. 
then i read macs need a $ before the wep code, still wrong password. 
so i called linksys they cant help with a mac but said apple could. 
well its late and i am tired. 
so they said i would have to do it by way of static, i am a newbie to macs and dont know how to do it.
