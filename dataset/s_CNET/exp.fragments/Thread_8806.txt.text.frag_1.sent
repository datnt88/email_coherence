i am running a p-iv, 1.6, 512 ram,92ghd's, win xp pro and dial up. 
i just installed a stick of 256 memory, (identical to the first stick) and since doing that, my computer is quite a bit faster, (offline) but when i connect to the web, everything loads so much slower than when i only had 256 ram. 
any suggestions? 
thanks, bill
