hello, firstly, i'd like to say that i'm a complete dummy in networking. 
i am connecting to the internet via my laptop: laptop is connected to(through wifi) tlink sinus 154 dsl sinus 154dsl is connected to (through ethernet cable) to air live wireless ap air live is connected to my internet provider's ap, to which i do not have access, through wifi. 
i want to connect to the interface of the sinus 154 dsl, but i do not know its ip address (default ip was possibly changed by the guy who installed everything). 
is there any way to find the ip? i tried the default gateway, but it doesn't work. 
ip: 192.168.1.72 dhcp is turned off mask: 255.255.255.0 gateway: 192.168.3.2 dns: 194.204.159.1 any ideas?
