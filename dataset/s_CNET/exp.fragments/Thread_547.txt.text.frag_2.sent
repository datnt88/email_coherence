aren't there options in the software load? 
should be full or custom, generally you have some options. 
browse the disk and see if there might not be a way to do what you want to do. 
many times if you load the full software package you will wind up with a lot of superfluous stuff you may never use. 
i am not sure with hp units, mustek and some other scanners have many options from which to choose but i would browse the disk and see what you might be able to do.
