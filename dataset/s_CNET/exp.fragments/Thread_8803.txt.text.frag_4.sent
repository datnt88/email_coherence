thanks for the info provided in this thread - i appreciate the answers. 
however i think the messages from several individuals in the other thread in this forum &quot;ram compatibility questions&quot; provided the 'education' that i needed. 
i bought two 256mb samsung rimm modules from newegg identified as &quot;oem&quot; (after doing some -not exhaustive- online research on the subject) at a somewhat lower price than they were asking for some other 'branded' and not identified as 'oem' modules. 
am about to install them in front of my current 256mb (2@128), for a total of 756mb, and will let you know if it turns out negatively. 
again, thanks to all participants here. 
it is this kind of information sharing and communication that makes our computer-centric world evolve (and fun).
