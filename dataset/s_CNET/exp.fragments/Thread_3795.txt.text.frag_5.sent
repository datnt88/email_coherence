no doubt bob your right. 
i just haven't had the chance to see it. 
i have only worked with a 40-50 wireless networks of 1,000+ nodes each. 
but most all of them are the same brand gear so maybe that again is why i have been lucky. 
i will keep an eye out for that issue now. 
so thanks for the heads up.
