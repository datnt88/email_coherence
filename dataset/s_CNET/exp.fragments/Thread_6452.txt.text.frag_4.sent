i have just defragmented my hard disk and the time to open up word07 is now 6 secs so thanks that helped a lot!! furthermore- i now am wanting to get a core 2 duo for playing games at higher settings and resolutions the most. 
what are the other jobs of a processor besides playing games better? 
do they help in using itunes by any chance? 
( as i am a itouch user )
