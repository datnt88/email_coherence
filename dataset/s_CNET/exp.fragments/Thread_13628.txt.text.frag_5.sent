the sad fact is that these older machines aren't really worth anything, either intact or as parts. 
you might sell the hard drive and the memory but not much else. 
however, there are charities that can use them, assuming they are fully working. 
here in the uk, there is an organization called computeraid that will take an older system, check it out and recycle it to under-privileged children in the third world. 
i guess you can probably find such an organization where you live. 
while you should wipe your hard disk (i think partition wizard - find it on the web - will do it for you but there are many such cleaners available fro free) if you find the right recycler, they will also ensure the hdd is clean.
