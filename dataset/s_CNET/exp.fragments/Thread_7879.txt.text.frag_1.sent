i am using a 2wire dsl router/modem with sbc att dsl. 
i am running 4wireless laptops on the router. 
two have windows xp and the other two have windows vista. 
for some strange reason, when i initially connect to the router using my laptop(with latest v. of vista) i connect fine and all the laptops stay connected, but the router loses connection to the internet. 
none of the computers are able to access the internet, but they can talk to the router. 
after about 30 seconds or so the router reconnects and all the laptops can use the internet again. 
this only occurs with my laptop, but does not happen with the others(other vista laptop is not up-to-date). 
if anyone has ran across an issue like this please let me know, and if you have a fix that would be very helpful.
