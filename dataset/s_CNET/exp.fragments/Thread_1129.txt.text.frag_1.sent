i keep having a problem where i turn on my computer but have nothing display on the screen. 
i can hear that windows is starting up but the monitor will show &quot;no signal&quot; (or something of the sort). 
ive found that holding the button in till it turns of and then turning it back on usually, eventually, will allow it to start normally but obviously this is not something i wish to continue. 
i know that it is not the monitor as i have recently changed it and the problem was still there with my old monitor. 
i assume that it may be the graphics, however i only purchased the graphics card this year and i can remember that it did used to happen sometimes with my old graphics card. 
any help with this problem would be greatly appreciated.
