i am referring to the klipsch 7.1 speakers system. 
i did a lot with my 5.1 logitech z-680 & 5.1 logitech z-5500. 
i guess the klipsch 7.1 system would sound good placed good in a nice small room. 
if you dicide to hook them up to any kind off tv system you will have to get and adapter. 
this is the apater that i got and used it on my tv system, click on the link below. 
the logitech 5.1 speakers systems below. 
good luck wendell h
