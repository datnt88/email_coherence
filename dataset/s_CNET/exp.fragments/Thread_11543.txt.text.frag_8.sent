hello stan, with 98se you can re-install without formatting your drive which i try to do a little as possible as only having ms backup. 
i know the manufacturer of my card, they are a local company to me but the lines are always busy so impossible to get through. 
even trying through the web-site takes days at the moment. 
everyone is too security concious in the uk at the moment. 
i do realise what i have to do but having the time just makes it difficult ... please give me a couple of days ... i'm still waiting for my dsl provider to fix a fault on my dsl as i'm losing data both ways until it's fixed ... this fault started back last year and the isp have just realised that what i've been telling them for 6 mths is correct. 
cheers stan, whitesnake
