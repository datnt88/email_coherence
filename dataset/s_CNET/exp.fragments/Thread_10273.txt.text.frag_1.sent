i have been using a netgear rangemax wpn824 wireless router for my home network for the past year or so. 
we have 5 computers in our house, two wired desktops and 3 wireless laptops. 
i also have a wired backup server and my son has xbox 360 connected (wired) to use the xbox live service. 
at any given time, we may have a few more machines connected when visitors come through or my daughter is home from college. 
aside from my son complaining about occasional lags with xbox games, the router seems to be able to manage the load reasonably well. 
i recently purchased a new d-link dir-655 xtreme-n gigabit router after reading the reviews. 
i was hoping to improve range and performance. 
after connecting the router and starting with default settings for the most part, our connections kept randomly dropping. 
so i called d-link tech support. the rep told me that home routers are not meant to support more than 5 connections at a time. 
i was really taken by surprise by this. 
my question now is... is that true across the board? 
what are the practical expectations of routers used for home networks?
