a number of conditions: first off do not pull the drive from the main computer without safely removing the hardware. 
use the disconnect icon to the lower right side of the screen. 
yes i know it is suppose to be puug&quot;n&quot;play but for some reason attached usb devices like hard drives and thumb (sticks) drives can loose the boot sector. 
keep trying to get a read on the drive by using it on another system. 
if you can't, look into a restore program. 
go to tucows.com and get all you want there.
