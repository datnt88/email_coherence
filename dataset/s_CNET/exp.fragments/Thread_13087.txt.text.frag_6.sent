those cards are pushing the limits of the power supply. 
i think most if not all of those cards require a external power supply, which means they draw more than the 75w that the slot itself can provide. 
it isn't a particularly heavily taxed system, but 300w doesn't seem like enough. 
most those cards require a 350w minimum. 
i'm really sorry... what resolution are you running, per chance? the 7600gt is a great deal right now and the 8600gt isn't a bad card, either. 
the 8600gts is not too much slower than the 7800gt, but the 8600gt is. 
kind of confusing, but check out these charts: unfortunately, they don't include the 8600gt!
