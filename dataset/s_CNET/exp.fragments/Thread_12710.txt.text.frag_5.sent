according to the device manager troubleshooter the floppy disk drive is working ok. however, thanks for the question about the light on the drive itself. 
i don't recall seeing the usual operating light so i guess it's the drive at fault. 
i won't have access to this pc for a while. 
however, i'm surprised windows xp troubleshooter did not tell me it's the diskette drive at fault if indeed that is the case.next 
time i get to this pc, i'll check out the bios settings. 
thanks
