1. microsoft doesn't have a clue about drivers. 
do not rely on it's driver update or check buttons. 
2. when i need to fix this issue i look to install not one driver but two. 
here's what i look for. 
a. motherboard chipset support drivers. 
b. ethernet driver. 
3. where do i get these? 
usually from the motherboard maker's website.
