hi, i hope someone can help me decide here. 
i am looking for a personal printer. 
i guess that would be a color inkjet. 
i have read all reviews and going crazy by now. 
i am so undecided. 
i have read good stuff on the epson c86 printer and canon i560 printer. 
does anyone know which one is better? 
or does anyone have a better suggestion? 
i really appreciate your help, rachel
