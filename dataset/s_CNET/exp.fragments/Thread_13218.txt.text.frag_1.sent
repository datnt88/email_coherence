i have a wireless upnp device on my home network, and it stopped accessing media from my main pc's (vista home premium 32 bit) wmp all of a sudden. 
so, i checked media sharing in the network and sharing center, and i found that it had been turned &quot;off&quot;. 
when i click &quot;change&quot;, it opens up the wmp media sharing window, but the upnp device is set to share media, and the &quot;allow&quot; button is greyed out. 
clicking &quot;ok&quot; at this point only closes the window, and takes me back to square one (network and sharing center). 
i googled this issue, and found that many people had similar issues with xbox360 or ps#. 
however, i could not find a definite solution. 
does anyone have a solution to this problem?
