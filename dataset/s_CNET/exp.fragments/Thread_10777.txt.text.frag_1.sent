ntfs - fat32 - partition/format i recently installed a 2nd hd (80 gig - non formatted/non partitioned - as of yet)...my original system is running xp on a 40 gig fat32... 1. is it in my best interest to convert the fat32 to ntfs...and format/partition the new 80 gig to ntfs or run the 40 as is and run the 80 as ntfs? 
2. when/if i convert the fat32 to ntfs, should i just use the xp convert ''tool'' since i have the os/programs/files on the drive? 
or should i backup the drive and format? 
benefits/drawbacks? 
3. i am in search of a way (if possible) to backup my operating system and programs so i do not have to reinstall everything from scatch...(if not the best idea...suggestions?) background information: system will eventually have an external hd to use as a backup of drive #2, while drive #1 strictly runs os and program files.
