i have just fixed a p4 which shut down everytime a burn was attempted/ pulled the heat sink off the processor - thermal glue had dried out in there. 
bought a tube of silver 5 thermal glue for $10. also changed a failing 300w psu for a 400wpsu - $23. runs great now with no shutdowns. 
buzzing could be - loose covers or add on blanks. 
could also be a fan virbating
