as i understand it, the 4-wire fans(2nd level) only work when needed once a certain temp is reached. 
once, that theshold is meant, then the higher rpm fan setting kicks in to help cool an over-heated cpu. it seems after reviewing the website robert posted you're within std. 
specs. 
of the cpu operation. 
unless, your bios has a fan setting to change, then all this is done at a h/w level and no action from you will change it.
