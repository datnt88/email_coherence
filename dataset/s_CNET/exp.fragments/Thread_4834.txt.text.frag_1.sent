ok, i'm sure this is already somewhere in the forums but i've been searching for an hour and can't find my answer so i'm starting a new thread. 
i just had to move my cable modem far away and i need to extend my wireless network range. 
connected to my internet is a linksys wrt54g and i have an extra belkin wirless g router model no: f5d7230-4 laying around that i want to use as an access point. 
i have not been able to get it set up properly. 
i had wpa protection on, then turned it off completely. 
i can't figure out what settings i need to change on my linksys or belkin to get them to work properly. 
i have been tinkering but whenever i think i get it setup, i can't pull up one or the other's setup page. 
let me know if i need to give more information for someone to solve my problem. 
thanks pat
