on my late wife's computer, an intel p4 3 gig, the temp monitor is showing 50 degrees c, it used to be rather less than that. 
i wish to remove the cooling fan and heatsink so i can clean it properly. 
i believe it may be quite dusty in the cooling fins etc. how do i remove it? 
i have released the two over-centre levers, which loosens it, but the cage is still held in place. 
it looks as if once the cage is unclipped or released, the fan and heatsink might come off. 
what exactly holds the cage in place, and how do i unclip it? 
many thanks.
