i need a wireless bridge because i have a few network appliances that cannot use wireless in that fashion(like a wired network camera). 
i have four or five wireless routers (all are configurable as access points, also), plus one regular access point. 
also, i have a few wired routers and a few switches/hubs. 
just no bridge. 
also, i do not want to use a wireless-equipped computer as my bridge, which i have heard of. 
mainly, i just want to use a wired network camera with as little equipment as possible (camera, hub, bridge) to watch over my baby's room.
