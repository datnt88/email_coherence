i bought a hp computer that has the amd 64x2 4200 and couldn't be happier. 
i added a video card and another gig of ram and the computer is amazingly fast. 
a friend bought a computer with the intel duel core processor and has had a lot of heating problems with it. 
he has the same model computer as mine but with the intel processor and mine runs circles around his speed wise. 
i don't do gaming but i do a lot of grapics and the speed is very much welcomed.
