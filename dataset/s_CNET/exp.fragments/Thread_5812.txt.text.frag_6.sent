one of my pcs is a cyberpower, pentium 4. i ordered it by phone and then picked it up at their shop. 
i have used it for over 5 years without any problems. 
if you order from them make sure you get all of the driver disks! 
they failed to include mine and their customer service was awful and argumentive. 
they are a chinese business with direct supply links to china. 
that is how they can build such an inexpensive pc.
