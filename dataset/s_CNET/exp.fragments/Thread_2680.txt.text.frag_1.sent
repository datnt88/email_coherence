hi fellow members i reside outside the united states and am in need of a desktop system but unfortunately cannot afford to purchase one in the short to mid term. 
as a contract facilitator at a skills training centre, where i teach level 1 computer studies; my stipend does not allow me to replace my system that crashed over six (6) months ago. 
i cannot even afford the cost of repair(it needs a new mother board and processor). 
i am also pursuing distance learning studies therefore you see that i am trying desperately to keep a positive attitude. 
currently, school is out and so i borrow friends' system when they have a little downtime; which is usually infrequent and haphazard. 
computer recycling programs that allow request from non-us citizens are yet to discovered; believe me i have tried. 
is there someone out there who has a internet-ready system that they no longer need and are willing to donate? 
thanks in advance.
