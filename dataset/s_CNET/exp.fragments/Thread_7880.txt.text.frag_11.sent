makes for interesting, and accurate, reading. 
while your speculation on the technical abilities of the macbook after the spring update (if such a thing happens. 
it is always speculation as to when, and if, apple will change any specs on any machine) may be correct, it would not help the poster with any existing macbook that they may have already purchased. 
meanwhile, the max ram for the current run of apple macbooks, pending any evidence to the contrary, stands at 2gb.
