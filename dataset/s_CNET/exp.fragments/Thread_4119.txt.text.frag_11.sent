to the best of my knowledge it could be a few different things. 
first i want to say check your video game options for video settings. 
then the settings in the video card's control panel, like performance and quality settings(antialiasing,anistropic filtering)make sure these are set to application controlled. 
then check software options(screen saver, automatic wallpaper changer)if your running a skin changing program like style xp. also open up the pc and just take the video card out and reinstall it, the teeth could be misaligned somewhere or it could be defective product. 
other than that i'd just reset the video options to default if everything else is to no avail.
