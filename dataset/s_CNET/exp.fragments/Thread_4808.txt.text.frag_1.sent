i'm using windows xp and a 512 flash drive. 
i have downloaded john haller's portable firefox,thunderbird, and sunbird. 
they work fine but haller and pc mag in their article on same recommend creating a root directory for the drive but do not tell how to do it. is anyone out there using portable apps who knows how to create a root (c?) directory for this drive? 
i've just downloaded another portable app from haller and he talks about unzipping this file into the profile of the earlier firefox version. 
i know how to unzip files, how to delete on the flash drive but that is the extent of my knowledge. 
i think the directory will create a way to bring the drive up on my pc and will make updates and changes possible----not sure. 
my compusa drive does not require drivers. 
how to make the directory? 
do i really need one and will it change anything about the portability of the flash drive? 
i've googled and can't find any answers. 
please help.
