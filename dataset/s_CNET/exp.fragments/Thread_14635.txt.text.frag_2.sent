if so i have only seen demos of this but never in off the shelf machines. 
i'm going with no and then suggest a solution. 
get a pair of netbooks with hdmi (those 238 buck things at target.com?) and use those. 
or maybe a pair of logitech revues at 99 bucks each and use the web browser on that. 
for the network you would have to reveal how you get the internet without &quot;any network or internet capability.&quot;
