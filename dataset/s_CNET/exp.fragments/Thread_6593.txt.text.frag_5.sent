hi, so this has been talked about on the dell community forums and many of us who are home xps customers have called into tech support with the xps dedicated tech phone number and received very satisfying support. 
from what i can tell looking over the business sections, dell also sells xps systems through the business side too and they might have the tech support based here in the states. 
either way, the support is there and whenever i need to speak to a senior tech, i get one. 
just more feedback and i hope it adds more to this post.
