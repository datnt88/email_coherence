does anyone here have any experience with this tablet? 
a good friend who is wheelchair bound is thinking about buying this tablet. 
he mostly will be using it to watch horse racing, baseball, football and pretty much any sports so it has to be able to run flash which this does. 
what browser does asus use on the transformer and how is the wifi strength? 
any advise i can pass on to him would be very much appreciated.
