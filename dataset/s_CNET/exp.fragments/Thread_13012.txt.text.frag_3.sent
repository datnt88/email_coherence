what would you like to know? 
i am relatively new at this, so plese bear with me. 
right now, no encryption, i have a valid ssid, channel scan enabled, super g disabled (tried different configs here, to no effect), hidden wireless is disabled. 
i have dhcp enabled with the proper mac address and name of the laptop setup in the router. 
i did nothing to &quot;virtual server,&quot; &quot;port forwarding,&quot; &quot;application rules,&quot; or &quot;network filter.&quot; 
i am confused...
