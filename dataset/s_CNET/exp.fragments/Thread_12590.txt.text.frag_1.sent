we purchased a buffalo technology 500gb linkstation live bth hsdh500gl and want to set it up with our linksys wrt54g v8 router. 
however, there have been numerous problems setting up the buffalo drive, the latest being that there is no indication the router even &quot;knows&quot; it is connected. 
does anyone have any suggestions?
