but, expedia's horrible service has kindly provided me with a $200 coupon for our next flight purchase. 
this to make up for *&(#*#*&ing our last trip up. 
so i have to use them to get my $200. 
otherwise, i would be buying direct from iceland air. 
great people, decent food, nice little stop-over to strech the legs and grab a cig then off to destination. 
thanks for posting!
