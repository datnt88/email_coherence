building ur own comp? 
its well worth it because u get to choose the parts u want in it and almost every aspect of your pc. u can make one heck of a pc with 2 grand man. 
and even if u dont know how to build one just go to comp usa or your local pc shop and they will assemble it for you for a small price. 
hope this helps goodluck with your pc
