but could i make a replacement internal hard drive in case my present one dies.....yes ------------------------ if so how? 
buy a new hd...retail version. 
it should come with a disk&gt;disk copy util. 
install new hd as slave. 
copy master&gt;slave. 
remove slave and set it on the shelf. 
if/when the master dies. 
remove master....install new hd as master...boot it up. 
-------------- another way....image. 
i have a spare hd on the shelf. 
i image my system to optical media monthly. 
if my hd dies i'm looking at maybe 30 mins of recovery time. 
yes i might lose 30 days of data....but i'm not a business user...so that's ok.
