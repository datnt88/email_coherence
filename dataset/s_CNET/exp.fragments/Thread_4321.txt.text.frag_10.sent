i will look into the what coryphaeus said and look at hp's website for a picture of my pc. then i will compare it to what you said. 
if i understand everything and the steps are all the same, then i will try to do it. 
if not, i'll come back here for more help! 
you know i can't get enough of this website! 
thanks, ylc
