hi...yes, if there had been a cd, i would have had easy access to it as i have two cd storage systems. 
however, maxtor tried to make things easier for the user by putting the installation software right on the hard drive itself so that all you had to do is plug the external hard drive into the usb port and then launch the installation/utility software from it. 
no cd comes with the hard drive. 
the installation software for the utility was, in fact, convenient. 
however, maxtor did not factor in that the software allows you to lock the hard drive using this utility software and that a lughead like myself might have a need to reformat the internal hard drive where the utility software was installed and forget to make a backup of the installation/utility software from the external hard drive. 
now, because the maxtor external hard drive is locked, i cannot get to the setup/utility software to launch it as locking the hard drive keeps windows from recognizing it (the external hard drive) ... but i do not have a backup copy of the setup for the utility software other than what is on the external hard drive itself. 
hopefully, someone out there has one of these drives and will share the setup software with me or point me to a resource that can provide it.
