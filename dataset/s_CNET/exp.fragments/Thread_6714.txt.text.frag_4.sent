require you to enter the user name and password from the isp into the routers setup page. 
other isps will give you a modem/router to use and when adding another router you may need to adjust the isp's modem/router's settings. 
so without more information being given, only guesses can be made. 
does the internet work when connecting the modem directlt to a pc?
