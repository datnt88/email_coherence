the symptoms are inline with your suggestions. 
lately it has been intermittent, this morning it booted in less then 60 seconds. 
also, chkdsk occassionally reports index issues, it repairs the index but it doesn't seem to have any effect on the boot time. 
i'm going to image a new drive and see what happens.
