follow robert's advice. 
the w@k cd is suppose to be bootable, provided you have set the bios to boot from cd. this is a way to assure you can boot. 
you say, your hd is ok but you boot from a floppy, not the same thing. 
if you want to start over, simply install the w2k cd in the cd drive and boot from it. 
you should be able to reformat, etc. to reload the os. tada -----willy
