if you look at games they are a different class than pc gaming. 
as to the office there is no microsoft office for that tablet and some rushed out and bought this to learn that later on. 
curb the enthusiasm and do a little more search and demand a demo of the apps that let you open office documents. 
i found them to be ok but no replacement for the real thing. 
i'm back to a laptop but still have 3 tablets on my desk as we work on android apps.
