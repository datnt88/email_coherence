that seems to me to be way too much disk space for a primary drive. 
if you're bent on raid 0 with these 10000 rpm drives, why not consider the less expensive 150 gig drives. 
that gives you 300 in raid 0 which will hold a lot of software. 
my preference is to store data off of the primary drive as this tends to grow to enormity and makes backing up more complicated if the primary drives grows with it. 
i prefer to get a huge secondary drive plus an external or two to store data and use for backups....maybe a nas too.
