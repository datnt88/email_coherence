if the drive is from 2002 too, then consider you got your moneys worth. 
i would replace, asap. the cost isn't that much and it may take out a precious cd you may like. 
anything coming/falling from a drive is bad news. 
-or- you could use it until it really poops out. 
its your choice, but again, i would replace it. 
also, if you have kids, are they into mischief? 
if possible post a link with some pics of the items in question.
