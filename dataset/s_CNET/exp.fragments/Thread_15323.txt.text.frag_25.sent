i was wondering if this class-action lawsuit was still coming up or if it had already been settled. 
i bought my emachine t6420 in dec. 
07 for around $700 or so if i remember correctly and had to replace the motherboard in jan. 
08 for another $160. 
just recently i tried to upgrade the video card so i bought a pciexpress card, but the motherboard doesn't seem to see it there. the one time that it did see it, the computer froze during the windows loading screen. 
i am definately down for getting my money back for a machine that has seemed to cause problems for just about everyone who has owned one. 
please let me know what is/has happened with this lawsuit. 
thank you jon plouffy_69_01@yahoo.com
