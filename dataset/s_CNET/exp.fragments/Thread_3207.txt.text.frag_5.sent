ps....no such thing as 'dual channel memory'. 
but there is memory that operates in the motherboard's dual memory architecture and for best results it takes matched pairs. 
to avoid the ram from going from 400mhz to 333mhz...get 2 dimms @1gb each and place them in the first dual channel dimm slots. 
test the new dimms thoroughly with memtest86+. 
if they test ok....then add the 2 @ 512mbs and see how it runs... be prepared to obeserve the impact and tradeoff of the ram speed reduction and the extra 1gb ram. then make your decision what to do the 2-512s.
