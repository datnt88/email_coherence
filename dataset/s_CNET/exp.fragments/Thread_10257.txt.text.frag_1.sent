hello all, i'm using an epson gt-s50 scanner on win7. 
i need to scan long receipts, 3&quot; by 60&quot;. the epson only scans up to 34&quot;. is there a solution that doesn't involve me buying another scanner? 
i'm wondering if i can find a longer carrier sheet, then maybe i could use that? 
where could i get a longer carrier sheet? 
due to legal reasons, i can't cut the receipts, only fold them. 
folding them thus far has failed because the scanner thinks it's two sheets of paper and tries to tear the receipt apart. 
i tried a different scanning software, vuescan, and that didn't work. 
it scans so far and then indicates a paper jam. 
any solution needs to work quickly because i'm only allowed to scan these receipts for a few hours, so i have to work fast. 
any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks.
