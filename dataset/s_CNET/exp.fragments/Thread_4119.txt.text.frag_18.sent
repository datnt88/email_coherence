this sounds a lot like something else eating up your cpu, not a problem with the videocard. 
have you installed new programs that might be running in the background? 
are you trying to run additional programs while you run your game? what about the possibility of an infection- is you anti-crapware running and up-to-date? 
these are the first things that i would look for, especially since it's program response and not just video performance that seems to be suffering. 
try running the task manager to see what all is running while your computer is acting up.
