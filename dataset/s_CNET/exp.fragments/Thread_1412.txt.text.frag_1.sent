i have a old pentium 2 computer with a 3 gig hard drive. 
my uncle thought it would be &quot;nice&quot; to format that and then give me windows xp pro along with microsoft office. 
i now have about 400 mb of space left( he thought that was soooo funny). 
i put in another 3 gig hard drive that has already been formated and is compleatly empty. 
my question is what do i now need to do to make everything work, and transfer some stuff from one to the other. 
or whatever will work the best. 
help!!!!!!
