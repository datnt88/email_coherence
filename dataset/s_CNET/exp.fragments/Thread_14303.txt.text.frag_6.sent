ah--my laptop happens to be a dell as well!! were you also getting disconnected when your isp changed your ip number, or were you having a problem connecting all of the time? 
as i mentiond earlier, the only time i have a problem is when my isp changes the ip number every few days. 
that makes me wonder if my solution could possibly be as simple as changing a setting--but if so, which setting????
