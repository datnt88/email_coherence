thanks, everyone -- we're slowly but surely working on all your suggestions, and i'll let you know the results when we're done. 
my new power supply is a 450-watt okia, which was rated highly by tiger direct customers, and so far it seems to be doing the job. 
but as suggested by you and others, we're also checking the fans -- i'm not mechanically skilled, and the banshe is taking his time checking this out. 
our geek friend doug is out of state right now, but has promised to look into everything as soon as he gets back (beginning of may) as well. 
in the meantime, i shut the computer down every time i step away for more than a few minutes, which seems to be the lesser of two evils at this point -- i'd rather not take the chance of doing damage from repeated sudden shutdowns. 
the chimney is just a vent, nothing innovative imo. the banshe was quite impressed by it, but his hp is more reliable when it comes to heat, so i think the chimney is just for looks. 
just a note -- every computer i've had has been possessed by demons. 
it must be me, lol. 
but this is really the least serious problem i've dealt with. 
thanks again -- will let all of you know what we find out as we try out all suggestions.
