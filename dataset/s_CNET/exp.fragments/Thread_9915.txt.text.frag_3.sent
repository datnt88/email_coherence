i am looking for a server that has at least 4 bays for digital backup of my media that can also run utorrent that is easy to use and setup. 
i also followed your advice and found several replies you did stating the same thing over and over again about this not being a storage device. 
so next time if you do not have any good advice or suggestion to add for my request for help and please keep it to yourself. 
i am looking for assistance not criticism. 
thanks.
