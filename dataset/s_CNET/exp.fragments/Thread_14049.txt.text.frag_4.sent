no other devices between the touter and the laptop operate in the wireless realm. 
how do i go about sweeping other routers signals? 
is that a diagnostic tool built into the windows wireless network setup? 
since the card in my laptop is and internal oem i do not believe there is additional software beyond the windows standards. 
i repeat, i have tried setting the router on all the different channels to no effect, and the router is on a cabinet about 5feet off the floor. 
all the networks my computer sees are wep protected (so my computer wont try to connect to any but mine). the problem is that mine will faze in and out and be replaced by one specific other router.
