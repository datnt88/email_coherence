robert's advice maybe just the ticket to follow. 
i only suggest, if you haven't already to clean the ram slots themselves, use an old toothbrush(alcohol damp) and brush down, allow to dry and then try again. 
if you're using non-similar brand ram, they are incompatible if only slightly, its not suppose to be a problem, but it can happen, try using a &quot;match pair&quot; even if only 128mb each to test. 
since, you didn't mention the os, if win9x/me 512mb is a known problem with that much ram installed, check here for cures: find related topic.
