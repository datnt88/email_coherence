under usb devices somewhere not have it default to auto with each restart. 
i've forgotten the process but i had to halt during post and go usb device setting and restart until the drives appeared by model #. i exited and saved the settings. 
i also can allow more time for usb devices to present themselves. 
i had to add a few seconds for one of my drives that was a bit slow to spin up. 
you might see what options you have in your bios to remedy this.
