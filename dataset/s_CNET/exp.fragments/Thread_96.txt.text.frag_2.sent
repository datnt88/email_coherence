well if you had dsl service with at&t like i do, my 4 year old dell desktop computer also has no 56k modem in it but it does have a 10/100/1000 ethernet port on the back. 
if you had dsl with at&t the red dsl cable furnished by at&t with their modem, mine is a westell modem, that red cable would come directly out of the phone jack on the wall to the back of the dsl modem provided by at&t, the yellow cable many refer to as the ethernet cable would plug into the ethernet port on the back of the dsl modem located right next to the red cable on the modem then the other end of the yellow cable would connect to the ethernet port on the back of your wireless router. 
my wireless router is a linksys model #wrt54g. 
the blue cable would then be plugged into the port next to the ethernet port on the back of the wireless router and the other end of the blue cable would connect to the ethernet port on the back of your desktop pc. that's what i had to do last week when i moved my computer from one room to another in my house. 
i had to contact at&t to get their dsl modem to recognize my computer again and that was that. 
no problems with the router after making the move.
