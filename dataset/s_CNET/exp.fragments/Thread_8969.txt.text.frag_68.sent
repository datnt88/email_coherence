the number of time i had to resolve to formating was because my personal setting would not load after booting. 
and i guess it was due to a virus infection (especial trojan.scr). 
i wouldn't conclude this is the problem but any time the virus gets on, then there will be problem loading my personal settings and immediately the system will log off. 
so what is the problem and solution to kind of headache. 
my system config. 
p3,window xp professional, 256mb ram and 40g hard dis, 866 ghz processor
