the 3450 ain't bad but you are pushing your luck on power. 
i know that card and it's more juice than the 6200. 
and no to the agp or gpu data bus width. 
that has nothing to do with the os. as to the visual question i can bet no. but then again some may pick out this or that to be a flaw. 
i can't tell.
