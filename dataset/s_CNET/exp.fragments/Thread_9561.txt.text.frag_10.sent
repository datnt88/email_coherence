ive got tb of storage and not a lick of it is worth backing up. 
its just music, apps, and movies. 
the real stuff worth backing up thats actually irreplaceable will likely fit on a couple of 250-500 portables. 
that said, tb drives are likely going to be more prone to failure than small ones. 
do yourself a favor and determine how much of that data that you have is really worth saving. 
put it all in a folder, look at its size and copy it to two drives with barely 30 gb more storage. 
unless your doing graphic design or the like, you wont need any more backup space.
