based on the acer lcd i'm looking at. 
if i disconnect the monitor from the pc and then power the monitor on i see the acer logo. 
if i use the osd....on screen display buttons i can view and play with stuff. 
if i did not get a logo and the osd did not function i'd take a guess the monitor is &quot;borked&quot;.
