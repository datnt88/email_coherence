i live in an apartment, and in the explosion of wifi, i can usually detect up to 5 different routers. the result of this at times seems to be interference where some locations in my apartment never have connectivity to my router; despite only one thin wall and less than 20feet of distance between my laptop and my router. 
i have updated the router's firmware to the latest version, and have tried using different router channels to no effect. 
i am using a linksys wrt54gs router, and the laptop in question is an older (but still 802.11g) compaq 2200 series. 
when signal does reach the area in question, it is stong ( &gt;36mbps ), so i believe interference is the issue. 
is there anything i can do to help alleviate this problem? 
i can single out the network which is causing the interfering, is there any way to selectively block that particular ssid? 
any other suggestions?
