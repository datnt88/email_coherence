i am having trouble picking an imac. 
what is the difference in speed running programs like photoshop cs3, flash and corel painter on the imac with the 3.06ghz intel duo processor and the imac one step below? 
2nd, what graphic card should i chose? the nivdia geforce 8800 or the ati radeon? 
which would be best for these programs and minor gaming? 
any help (and links) you could provide would be greatly appreciated!
