i'd like to go on record first stating that the manual stated nothing about disc management, so if this is how one usually goes about installing a new drive, that manual is seriously lacking... also thank you for the quick response time. 
i ran the disk management program from the start search bar (i'm on windows 7 home 64-bit), and a window popped open that is called &quot;initialize disc&quot; &quot;you must initialize a disk before logical disk manager can access it. 
select disk: (and here it shows only &quot;disk 3&quot;) use the following partition style for the selected disks.&quot; 
there are two options, &quot;mbr (master boot record)&quot; and &quot;gpt (guid partition table)&quot;. 
then it adds, &quot;note: the gpt partition style is not recognized by all previous versions of windows. 
it is recommended for disks larger than 2tb, or disks used on ltanium-based computers.&quot; 
wow, so much technobabble...
