my emachine died on friday. 
came home and tried to power it up and got nothing. 
at first i thought it may be the hd, but soon discovered it wasn't. 
i can at least get all my data off the hd before i wipe it completely. 
i rebuild computers a lot and i've never had an issue with activating an os. it's all automated, unless something goes haywire on their end. 
then, you just read the numbers and they repeat a different set back, you enter them and your done.
