i have this netbook i put on the watt meter and it draws 9 watts when running and the screen has shut off. 
for reference the make and model is the emachines 250-1162. 
i've used both bluetooth and usb to serial converters with it along with apps i've written. 
for even lower power i've used windows mobile phones with the apps in c# and the serial connection via bluetooth serial ports. 
as to your method, you may have to try it.
