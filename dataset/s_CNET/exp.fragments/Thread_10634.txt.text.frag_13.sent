we went to t-mobile store and told them we were disgusted that we bought these phones for the wi-fi at home and it didn't work... and they gave us 2 routers (no charge) - one for home and one for our daughter to take back to college (where hers didn't work either) and... ta-da!!! wi-fi at home...success!!!!!
