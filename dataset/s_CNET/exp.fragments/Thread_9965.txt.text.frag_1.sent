i bought an asus p5gd-1 from here: and, apparently, it doesn't have a vga out. 
??? ??? i already had an old nvidia pci video card, so i put that into the top pci slot. 
so here's the issue i knew i was going to face: how can i change the bios settings without a monitor? 
any help would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks in advance, jon.
