take them out and put them in again. 
double check that you put the ram in the right way. 
do they match? 
do you have the right one in the right slot? 
run this diagnostics check: the cpu did you install it correctly? is it the right one for the board? 
how about the power supply is it big enough? 
this one is tough to diagnose: 500 watts is the upper limit for most systems. 
anything more then this is &quot;over kill&quot;. 
if you have a $5,000.00+ 
system this may apply.
