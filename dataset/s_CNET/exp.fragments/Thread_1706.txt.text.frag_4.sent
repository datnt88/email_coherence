it is a t2642, and i was away from home for about a week. 
we had a power outage at some point during that time. 
when you push the power button, there are no signs of life. the guy i brought it to works from his house. 
i may spend the $60.00 and bring it to geeksquad. 
if it's the motherboard i can probably get a good price on newegg.com.
