the behavior you describe is normal for an &quot;atx&quot; type power supply, the type used in virtually all pc's made in the last 5 years or so. 
an atx supply is actually turned on via the motherboard. 
the switch on the back of the supply, if any, only switches on/off the ac going into the supply. 
to test on the bench, you need first attach a &quot;load&quot; to the supply to prevent damage, then jumper pins 14 and 15 to start the supply. 
please do not try this if you are not comfortable playing around with electricity! 
see for more info.
