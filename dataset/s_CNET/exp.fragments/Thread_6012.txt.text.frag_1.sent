hi there i bought two 1tb western digital &quot;my book&quot; drives. 
i have plugged them into my macmini, but no matter what i do only one of them will mount at a time. 
i'm wanting to mount both so that i can create a raid with them. is there any reason why i can't mount both of them? 
thanks in advance luke
