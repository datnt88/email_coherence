you might consider spideroak ( ), which has the advantage of allowing you to structure your data the way you want, and also keeps all versions in perpetuity. 
unlike dropbox, spideroak doesn't know the encryption key so nobody but you and your partner will ever be able to read the files. 
since you are in a business, pay the $100 a year to get 100gb of storage, then you and your partner use the same account, and then make sure the folders with the business files are selected for backup. 
while spideroak also has a sharing feature, you would only do this if you were only sharing a few files with somebody rather than actively collaborating on documents. 
spideroak never forgets a document, as files deleted from a computer are available from a deleted files link in spideroak until you decide to purge them. 
and, if you aren't doing so already, pay for online backups for both computers. 
i use backblaze ( ), which backs up unlimited amounts of data for $50 a year, and you can set your files to be encrypted so that nobody but you can access them.
