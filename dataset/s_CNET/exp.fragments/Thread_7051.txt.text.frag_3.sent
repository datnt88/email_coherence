in original posting, i indicated mostly what was needed for assistance. 
i am using an amd k-7 athlon, 1.1gig, os win xp prof, 40gig hd, with an atapi cd-rom and a lite-on ltr burner which is classified as a cd-rom. 
its the atapi-cd-rom that is not being recognized by my computer. 
i have gone into safemode, into device manager, system, un-install, rebooted and it found new equipment,(cd-rom), but it still came up with that black exclamation mark. 
troubleshooting states &quot;windows cannot load device driver for this hardware. 
the driver maybe corrupted or missing. 
code 39. i've gone into my cmos but nothing seems to help. 
maybe a new one would help, huh? 
lol. 
george i am using my secondary slot on moboard. 
i have hd in primary slot if that is their names.
