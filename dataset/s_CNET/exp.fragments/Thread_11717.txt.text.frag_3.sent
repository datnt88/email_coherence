thanks for replying! 
i don't think it has to do with the location of the router-- i can be sitting right next to it and move my computer off of my lap and it will go into limited-connection mode. 
other laptops in the house don't have this problem either. 
i'm on channel 6 because other houses are on 1 and 10. how can i check if my laptop is on &quot;a&quot; like you said? 
the router is set to &quot;11b/11g standard&quot; mode. the only other option on the router is &quot;g enhanced&quot; which i don't think is what i'm looking for.
