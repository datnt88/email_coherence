i read the sticky. 
switched to wpa-2 security, no real noticeable change in speed (though it may help with disconnects-who knows). 
installed the patch from microsoft support, the xp computer still doesn't show up. 
(am i supposed to install it on both computers? 
as of now it's only on the xp.) as for the info, i gave operating system, model number, the model of my router, my wireless card, what else do you need? 
i will give whatever info's required, but i'm not sure what else list.cnet.remains 
required.
