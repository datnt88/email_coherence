mp950 is still a nice unit generally epson has the advantage in ink and paper... epson has a much broader range of paper ...and generally you cant get canon results off anything but canon paper... but you do have the advantage in detail ..... so you win some and loose some ...your photos will have less pixelation and more detail but loose a litte in the color battle... if you never owned a permentant printhead before (like found in epson and canon)... to avoid cloggs this is what ive always done and have never had a printer clogg beyond cleaning on me... every other ink change i do a head cleaning with out needing ...just to get the built up crud from the ink out on a usuall basis. 
just couple tips for you... enjoy
