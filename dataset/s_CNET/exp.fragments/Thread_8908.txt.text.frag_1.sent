hi, i noticed that the lg x130 comes with a hidden partition that stores the backup-recovery for the netbook. 
is there any way to completely remove the hidden partition (or just disable the f11 option after the bios)? 
i would like the extra space and removing that f11 function would really come in handy. 
thank you!
