i am not so educated on the g5. however, the fastest processor for amd is the fx-55 and its specs are 2600/1024/htt. 
and the fastest for intel is the pentium 4 570j and its specs are 3800/1024/800. 
as christmas nears, intel will release a new p4ee and we will retake the market. 
that p4ee will be the fastest and its specs will be 3733/2048/1066 making for a speed daemon processor.
