do you think it is better to go to a ddr3 motherboard than a ddr2? 
i use music producing software and i need to make sure i can use this with out my computer bogging down. 
when it comes to cpu's it doesn't have to be the core i7, i will consider the ones before that as long as my computer can handle my music production software, so it doesn't bogg down my computer. 
then i am fine. 
is gigabyte motherboard the way to go? 
asus? 
evga?
