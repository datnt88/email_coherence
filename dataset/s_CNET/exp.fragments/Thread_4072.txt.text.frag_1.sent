other then going to an actual store like the apple store or a best buy. 
does apple offer any type of test drive program, where you can sort of rent a machine try it for a certain amount of time and return it back to apple. 
i am interested in a macbook but i would love a chance to explore the hardware and more importantly mac os 10 before taking the plunge into switching from a windows based enviroment to a macintosh in at least my laptop.
