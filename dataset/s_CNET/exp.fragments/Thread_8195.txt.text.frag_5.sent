hi, i don't have the 98se anymore because it is now win xp home so i am out of luck testing it on that. 
also, the bios is the latest version on both of the computers that i have tried to use it on. 
i checked the setup and usb is enabled for both computers also. 
it does not have a parallel connection on the scanner. 
i'm not sure what you mean about the motherboard drivers, as for usb drivers, i have hooked other usb things up and they work correctly. 
i also agree with you, it isn't as simple as it seems:(
