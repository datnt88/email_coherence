you might be able to hit that budget, if you watch slickdeals.net, and fatwallet.com 
for special deals which may or may not involve a few hundred dollals in rebates. 
i got a $3000.00 pc for $1500.00 on a special sale, and got a $2000.00 pc for $1200.00 on a special sale. 
i've seen deals for around $300.00 for decent pc's which have the ability to be upgraded. 
just make sure that whatever you get has pci express slot. 
future games will need at least that.
