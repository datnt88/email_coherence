dear mr chan i've found from experience that the more icons you have on your desktop, the more ram you use. the best way is to delete all that are absolutely inessential and use the start menu. 
what i've done is to organise my start menu into a series of sections, each devoted one topic - thus games are in the games section, office programmes int he office section and so on. 
also, the wattage output from the psu is critical, i have used 350 w output, but 400 or 450 is about the best. 
because i'm running xp i can get away with a large ram, and with a 2ghz prcessor i'm using 1gb ram, so far no problems. 
as far as the screen is concerned, i don't use a crt screen, instead i use an lcd screen and use an ati radeon 9600xt graphics card, so stray magnetism is not a real problem with me (the lcd is a flat panel screen so makes for desk use)
