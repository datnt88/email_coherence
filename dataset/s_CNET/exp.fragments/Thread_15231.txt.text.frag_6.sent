if you want to get uppity when i double check an item, then i'll wish you well and not tell you my thoughts. 
gives us a clue you can try connecting the tv out to see if this tricks the card into 60 hz so you can flash the board's bios back to stock. 
i can only guess you had tried to overclock the board with that other bios. 
but that's just me guessing.
