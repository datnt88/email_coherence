enroute. the info at newegg didn't mention anything re single or dual ramdacs. 
i've never used video playback on my computers. 
i have television if i want to see &quot;movies&quot; a power user of a computer i am not. the monitor's native resolution is 1280 x 1024. 
theoretically 10 millisecond response. 
the point is that i, this writer, wants to see the difference between analog and dvi. 
i guess that i could read about it in a book, but if i were to advise another, i would like it to be based on what i saw. 
i actually have no other real reason for buying the monitor and card. 
[except also for fooling around with dual monitors in case i start working on a website again and can use split screen, one on each monitor]. 
but i appreciate your input, because i know it is based on expert knowledge.
