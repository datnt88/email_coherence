i was able to download the setup software from the info that linux_made provided to me but the installation stalls at the point it is supposed to detect the maxtor drive. is there actually a separate software for unlocking the drive in the software that comes with the drive that is separate from the setup software? 
i don't recall. 
if there is, then i would truly appreciate your offer to zip and send it to me. 
otherwise, i am thinking i need to find someone locally who has one of these drives with the software already installed on their pc and take my drive to them and unlock it. 
i agree with you about maxtor's brilliant ploy of putting the unlocking software on the locked device ... the least they could do was put a big warning in the installation instructions to back it up to a cd immediately, if they are too cheap to provide a separate cd. in any case, if you can provide software specifically for unlocking the device that would be great.
