new member here. 
i just replaced a hard drive in a compaq desktop, loaded xp home, and now dont have sound, or recognition of the wireless (on board) card that was operating prior to drive replacement. 
downloaded original drivers for wireless card and sound and mb.. etc, and when i go to install them, error message says that &quot;c&quot; drive has no memory, (&quot;c&quot; drive now shows as a removable drive, and the os is on &quot;h&quot; drive). 
only have one hard drive. 
1.did i make a mistake on original installation of os (drive/partition choice) when installing windows? 
2. do i reinstall/format the os and look for the &quot;c&quot; drive? 
3. how can i reassign where drivers are installed? 
(tried to re-name primary drive from h to c, and windows wouldnt let me. 
4. is this something i can do in dos? 
thanks so much for any help!
