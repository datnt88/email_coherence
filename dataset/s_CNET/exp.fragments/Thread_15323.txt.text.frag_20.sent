i've replaced motherboards numerous times on e-machines, sometimes with the same make and model, other times with newer or different models. 
though i don't use a &quot;restore disk&quot; per say, i've never had any problems reloading windows xp and using the existing license key that is affixed to the side of the e-machine. 
at the time you need to &quot;activate&quot; your operating system, you will notice an option to change the key. 
if you choose that option, you can enter your actual key and click generate id. with this new id, you'll be able to authenticate with windows. 
if not, call them, it takes about 6 minutes, they don't give you any problems and you'll be activated before you hang up.
