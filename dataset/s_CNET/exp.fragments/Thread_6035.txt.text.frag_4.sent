if the buzzing sound is coming from the system speaker, it maybe just the warning sound/siren for &quot;overtemp&quot; warning, then shutdown. 
you need to check the system bios and see what the temp setting is in order see if set right or at default, this is asaftey feature and shutdown. 
well, you say chimmey, that doesn't ring a bell with me. 
does this chimmey have a fan associated with ot simply an elongated vent? the cpu fan and its heatsink may have been installed improperly. 
either reseat with new heatsink compound(artic silver), scape of old compound or thermal paste or buy a better rated hsf(heatsink setup) to replace the current one. 
make darn sure the power supply fan is runing is so equipped. 
as for better wattage unit, that's aplus but some cheaper psu aren't really that good. 
buy a vantec, antec, enermax branded psu of at least 400w+ for best operation and stable outputs. 
check all that and get back to us.
