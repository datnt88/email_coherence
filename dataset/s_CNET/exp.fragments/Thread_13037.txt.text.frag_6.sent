the usual 4gb intel i7 powered machine. 
even a dell might be found for that if you don't go with gamer video cards. 
too bad the machine you use today was not revealed. 
it could serve as a point of reference. 
such as it's 2gb versus 4gb. 
why it matters is that 4gb is not double 2gb. 
it's much more than that since the os ate a little (?) of that 2gb. 
i see folk going overboard on such things.
