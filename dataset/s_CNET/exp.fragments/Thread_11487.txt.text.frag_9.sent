during the setup of your linksys, the setup software should have generated an alpha-numeric code for you to either write down or print. 
you would then have needed this code to connect your wireless hardware to the router. 
otherwise, the router will not let you connect. 
if this never took place, or you bypassed it in some way, then your network is unsecured. 
anyone outside your home or in a home nearby would be able to log in. 
but if you went through setup properly, and got the generated code from the router, you have nothing to worry about.
