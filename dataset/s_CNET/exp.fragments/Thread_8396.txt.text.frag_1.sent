i currently own a hp media center that came with a hp vs19b 19&quot;(quite good) that have a problem now. 
problem: when i woke up one morning i always turn my monitor first and my computer second and go off to brush my teeth. 
coming back, the monitor was still off it seems. 
i press the power button many times until i realized that the monitor is possibly broke. 
if i try to power on my monitor it will either do two things: after a few minutes without power when i press the power button it will make the kind of sound i always hear when its turn on but nothing else or after a few minutes and pressing the power button i will create that sound and may turn the blue light for a few seconds then gone again. 
i know my graphic card isn't the problem since it doesn't matter if its plugged in or not and i don't feel like buying another 19&quot;(200$). 
i used my old computer's monitor on this computer to manage with my daily stuff. 
if you can help in any way, thanks.
