am i the only one to notice a jump in the pixel count of digital cameras? 
it was not long ago that i bought my first camera with 2mp count. 
this was just an entry level device but still considered reasonable. 
upgrading to a 4mp camera was quite expensive but i did eventually do it. 
but now when i see cameras advertised the cheapest are 5 to 6mp. 
i am sure technology has not accelerated that much in such a short time (measured in months rather than years).are 
they using a different measurement for the pixel count now? 
interpolation comes to mind.
