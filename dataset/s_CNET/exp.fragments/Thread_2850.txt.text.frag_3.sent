i had a similar experience but my system locked into a continuous restarting of the os after coming to the startup options menu. 
this is normal behaviour with massive hardware changes at one time. 
i needed to boot to the xp cd and do an installation repair followed by a reactivation of the os. it was relatively painless and i was expecting this and came prepared. 
the system worked fine after all new drivers were in place. 
i'd try the installation repair method. 
if you can make a full copy of the old drive first or an image of it, you can try multiple times if mistakes occur. 
good luck.
