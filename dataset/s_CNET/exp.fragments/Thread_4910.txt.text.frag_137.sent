has anyone made any progress trying to get gateway to pay for this mess? 
i have had the same problem with my gm5478 on and off for almost a year now. 
every time i think i have found a solution that works (i.e. new graphics card, added fan, updated bios), the problem eventually comes back. 
it is unnaceptable that a defective product like this was put on the market and gateway should be held responsible.
