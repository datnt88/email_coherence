i found this: and there are 32 and 64 bit drivers for both vista and windows 7. i'm fairly certain that you're going to need to force the installation of a driver. 
see the link below or google about mixing 32 bit and 64 bit drivers for shared printing. 
it gets complicated and there's no one answer. 
but you'll need the proper driver as a beginning. 
good luck.
