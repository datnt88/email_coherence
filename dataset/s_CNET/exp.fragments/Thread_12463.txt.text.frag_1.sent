hello guys! 
i have a problem here. the network at my house worked like this: everything was working fine. 
both computers could share files and i could use the internet using windows ics. 
but yesterday i bough a pcmcia evdo card for my laptop. 
and since i installed it both computers cannot share files or my laptop can use the shared internet connection. the computers can &quot;see&quot; each other, but when i try to see the files from one computer the system says the pc is unreachable. 
even the shared connection appears on the laptop, but when i try to use ie or firefox they say you can't connect. is there a way to fix this? 
i'd like to know if there is a way my network could work like this: 1 - pc uses the adsl broadband connection 2 - laptop uses pcmcia card when not in the local network 3 - laptop uses adsl shared broadband connection when in the local network 4 - laptop and pc shar files thanks in advance!!!!!
