''...i'm not trying to attack you, i'm just trying to keep the confusion level down'' the guy just asked a simple question about pci & agp. 
your reply may ring a bell possibly directed to high end competition gamers, but is gobble-de-goop imo for ordinary people who do regular gaming. 
down to the wire, there is nothing wrong with x800xl for ordinary gamers, except for maybe an extremely high tech competition gamer. 
there is nothing wrong with agp or pci-e for ordinary gamers. the plain pci video card for pci bus can only go as high as the nvidia 5700le. 
pci is the only available route for someone who's motherboard does not have an agp or pci-e slot.
