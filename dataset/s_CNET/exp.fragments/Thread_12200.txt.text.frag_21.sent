pci has a significantly lower bandwidth, so you might encouter some framerate problems. 
i brought a 9200se for my sis' desktop since the intel &quot;extreme&quot; graphics was failing. 
it's a pci card and not an agp. 
i started to notice some bandwidth issues when testing it out. 
in aquamark the frames would be good and then stop for a second and continue on. 
lack of bandwidth causes that. 
in 3d mark 2001se, it gets only a score of 3200. 
even when it's overclocked 50%.
