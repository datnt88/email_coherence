at current california prices for electricity the financial cost for the electrical power difference between the cards would be $37.74 (based on $.1436 per kwh) per year, if you run your pc 24/7. 
i'm clueless how many tonnes of co2 that is. 
obviously it'd be cooler to run. 
and sexier cuz it's new.
