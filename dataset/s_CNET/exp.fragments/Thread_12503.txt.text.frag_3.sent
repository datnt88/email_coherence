sometimes it just happens. 
even on a machine that is set up correctly and has no problems. 
happened to me yesterday. 
my explanation is &quot;gremlins&quot;. have never found a good reason, and have learned to not tear my computer apart looking for one. 
after closing nero and rebooting, same exact settings make a good burn. 
if it is more than a occasional thing, then look for a reason.
