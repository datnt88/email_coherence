if, as the seller says, &quot;plays all games at high settings, great working/looking machine! 
there is no game in the market this pc can't play on high resolution!&quot; , then why is he selling it? 
as others have said, it's long in the tooth, not particularly well configured and not particularly cheap. 
at $200-250, maybe but personally, i'd look elsewhere. 
ymmv!
