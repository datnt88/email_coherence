i want to add an 80g western digital hard drive to my dell, which has a 20g right now. 
i don't want to replace the 20g...i'm keeping it. 
so....i'm running xp, and i don't know what the heck they are talking about with the &quot;bios&quot; thing. is this going to be beyond my capabilities? the directions seem fairly straightforward, other than that bios thing. 
tell me if i'm nuts, and should just pay somebody to do it. 
i got a great deal on the drive, and was hoping to be self-sufficient, if i could. 
:-p thanks for your help~ sharon
