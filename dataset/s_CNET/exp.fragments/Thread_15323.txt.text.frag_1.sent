my motherboard died in my (e machines t6420) 4 days out of the 1 year warranty, and my brother's did the same in his t6420 just within the warranty. 
1. is there any way to find out if these boards are commonly defective, as 1 year seems ridiculous? 
2. do i have any recourse? 
who's the right person to complain to besides the tech dept which diagnosed the problem? 
3. any suggestions for a good quality upgrade motherboard if i'm stuck with the repair? 
thank you
