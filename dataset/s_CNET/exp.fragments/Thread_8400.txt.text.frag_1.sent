stay away from this product. 
what a nightmare product. 
not only is it as useless as list.cnet.remains 
more_fragments more_threads pre_process.sh 
s.cnet.dev 
s.cnet.test 
s.cnet.train 
scripts threads on a boar, but they won't refund your purchase! 
i spent weeks with the d-link tech folks, who are as frustrated as their customers. 
they can't get a firmware made that will keep the unit online and conflict-free. 
what ends up happening, as a customer, you end up as their beta-tester... and you get to pay for the privilege! 
if you are thinking of buying this junk-bin item, do your homework! 
read up on all the other users pulling their hair out trying to get their units working. 
you have been warned!
