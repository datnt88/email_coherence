thank you for your prompt reply. 
i just did a thorough cleaning yesterday when i took out the dvd rw. i've cleaned it in the past, too. 
i also run ccleaner, spybot, easycleaner,spyware blaster, and windows defender. 
i have avg for virus protection. 
6200? 
mb's? 
do i need to worry about the brand being compatible with my system? 
do you know if by upgrading the video card i could watch movies on my tv with decent quality?
