power off the router, switch, and pc. with all devices connected, power back up in this order: router - wait for the lights to stabilize. 
switch - wait for the lights to stabilize. 
pc. if you decide to move the pc, you may have to do the above steps again. 
for some reason, some systems and routers do not take well to disconnects and reconnects. the key word is &quot;may&quot; as once the pc is assigned an ip address, it may be able to move around as needed.
