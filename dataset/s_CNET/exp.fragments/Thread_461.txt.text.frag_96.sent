i have been using generic ink and toner refills for about 5 years now and have yet to have a problem. 
you must follow the directions to the hilt however. 
i have used inkproducts.com 
for years on my canon's and hp's with great results.i 
have not tried to use any of the special photo catridges or refilled them yet. 
their prices are very reasonable and saves me over 50%. 
they also have the toner refills for my xerox p12 laser printer. 
i have refill the same original cartridge 4 times and it is still perfect. 
abtrecyclers.com 
claims to meet iso 800. 
i ordered hp ink refills for a 3650 just to see their quality. 
haven't had to test yet due to my original cartridges are almost full.
