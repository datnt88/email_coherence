my requests and such were all sent via email. 
their response was via phone when they called. 
wonder if it would make a difference that the woman was hard to understand on the phone? 
after i got my response from ecs yesterday, i took and sent an email to their mb sales, and the corp sales email addresses. 
maybe someone in those departments can help. 
it makes me wonder how many others are out there that have the same issue as i have ran into. 
i can understand that if i didn't have the proof of purchase, that they wouldn't warranty their products. 
and unfortunately, i don't have the manuals anymore, but if i recall correctly, i believe their warranty states ''1 yr from date of purchase''. 
well, normally in the business/retail world, ''the customer is always right''... must not apply to ecs??? thanks tim
