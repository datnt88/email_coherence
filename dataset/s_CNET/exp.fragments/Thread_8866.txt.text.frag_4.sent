you said you're just trying to connect the pcs together to get them networked first and then will add a modem. 
presuming the modem is for internet access, you're going to also need a router. the router can assign the ip addresses you missed the first time around but you'll need to change your ip addressing from static to dhcp and dns to automatic assignment too.
