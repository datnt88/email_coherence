maybe i am putting too much faith into the raid system. 
i was hoping that i could avoid or at least minimize the amount of backing up i needed to do with the redundant drives. 
the hp seemed to be fine but with only raid 1 capability data corruption seemed to be a potential problem. 
i had thought that the raid 5 of the netgear might help in that aspect. 
i admit that am not that familiar with the pro's and con's of the different raid systems as a backup system to a hdd failure.
