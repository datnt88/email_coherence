that's why i noted a test on the 98 box is needed to be sure. 
i read your reply and see you did load the scanner drivers, but nothing about the motherboard drivers, usb drivers and if a parallel port connected scanner, if you tried the other modes in the bios. 
and nothing about the bios being latest since this can be an issue for xp &quot;upgrades.&quot; 
in short, it's not as simple as it would appear to be.
