it sounds like you have little recourse other than politely admitting your usage, since they have it documented. 
it doesn't take much to get up to 300mb these days w/ 3g/broadband. 
try to bargain with them to reduce the cost of the bill by offering to add an international data plan for a year if they reduce your bill. 
i know you don't want to pay but if you go this route you'll net ahead vs forking over the entire $4500. 
in general, i wouldn't expect much leeway if your calculations are correct as to how much you used since you knew the rate per kb prior to travelling with a laptop. 
best of luck.
