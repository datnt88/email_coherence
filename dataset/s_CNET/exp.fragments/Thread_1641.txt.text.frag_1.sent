running a broadband wireless network with netgear modem/router, two desktops, and one laptop. 
routine run of spybot s&d today zapped my connectivity, and after three system restore operations, the problem is still there. 
it tells me that this problem is occurring because ''the network did not assign a network address to the computer.'' indeed, running ipconfig shows the ip address and subnet mask as zeros. 
all other machines not affected, but i am floundering attempting to rectify this problem. 
i am running winxp home on the affected pc, and winxp pro on the other two. 
i would very much appreciate some advice on this one.
