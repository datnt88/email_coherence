hey everyone, i have a bit of trouble here. 
i just finished moving my hardware into a new case i am having a problem getting past post. 
here are the specs: motherboard: abit fatality an8 sli videocard: nvidia geforce 7800 gtx harddrive: maxtor diamondmax plus 8 40gb ata/133 2nd harddrive: seagate momentus 5400.2 120gb sata soundcard: siig soundwave 5.1 pci ram: ocz el ddr pc-3200 dual channel platinum 1gb (two sticks) cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 dual core processor 4800+ i also had two 120mm led silent case fans that were replaced by two new 120mm led silent case fans that came with the new case. 
i also removed a cd drive (but kept a dvd drive) because there is not a necessity for it. 
all of these parts with preexistent in a fully functional and working computer prior to moving them to a new case. the motherboard is equipped with a visual led/post code device that reads ?25? whenever i boot up my system. the manual describes post code 25 as: early pci initialization -enumerate pci bus number -assign memory & i/o resource -search for a valid vga device & vga bios, and put it into c000:0 sometimes it will code ?9.0.? before 25. the manual describe post code 9.0. 
as: complete uguru initial process award bios take over booting job i?m not using uguru so this baffles me. 
i?m not a hardware guy and i?m at the extent of my knowledge. 
obviously it?s a hardware issue however i?m fairly confident none of my hardware is damaged there for i must have connected something wrong, or made some type of mistake trying to boot it up after dismantling and rebuilding in a new case. 
any advice is welcome. 
thank you for your time.
