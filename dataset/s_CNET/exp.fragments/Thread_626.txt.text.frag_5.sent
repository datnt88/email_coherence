well that was a good idea. 
unfortunately, when i put myself in as a user on the windows 2000 computer, nothing changed on the windows xp end or the windows me end. 
i noticed another anomaly. the windows 2000 computer shows up on the network even if it is powered down. 
neither of the others shows up when powered down.
