socket 754 is dead (no more from the production line). 
that means replacement (and upgrade) cpu's and motherboards are becoming harder and harder to find. 
todays amd desktop cpu's fit socket 939 motherboards. 
current popular amd desktop product lines: - sempron (budget, analogous to intel celeron) - athlon 64 - athlon 64 x2 (dual core) - athlon 64 fx (gamer) more amd product line info: 130nm, 90nm, 65nm = size of cpu die (in nanometers) - smaller is supposed to be cheaper, faster, cooler, and more efficient, but actual models don't always see all these benefits.
