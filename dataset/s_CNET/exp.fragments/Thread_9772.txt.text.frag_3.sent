i saw some good review on it so it caught my attention. 
i read around the apu a10, and yesterday i been searching around for computer and i have found this one called arctic mc101 having the a10. 
looking good and the other feature are matching to what i m looking for...i might go for that... bob, what you mean when you say what happens next ?
