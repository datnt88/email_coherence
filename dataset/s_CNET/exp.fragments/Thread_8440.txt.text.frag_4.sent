with just the kb, mouse and monitor there will be some other hardware to get it to connect up. 
bluetooth is not an option past 32 feet (yes there are 100 foot devices) and the paltry speed will have us waiting for a screen to show up (figure seconds for each video frame change.) bluetooth is not the answer.
