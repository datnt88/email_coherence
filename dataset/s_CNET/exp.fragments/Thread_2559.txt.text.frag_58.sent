another rushed response aws i'm off to work... i have to reply here, because your post has reached the max, and i can't reply from there. 
btw, the model i gave you for the laptop is for a compaq in case you look it up. 
hp has the exact same specs on some of their models. 
generally, for a laptop, when it comes to replacemant parts, i would go with the manufacturer's parts to avoid incompatibility. the upgradability of a laptop is very limited anyway. 
take a look at the specs on the compaq- it has everything you need, including a card reader (no floppy though). 
also, re: dell laptops- there was a recent recall on a line of dell laps because they had a nasty habit of catching fire. 
i've bought replacement part for laptops in the past from ebay w/out any problems, but they were from the same manufacturer. 
last thing about laptops- you may want to buy an extended warranty for the screen- there's normally a different warranty period for the screen. 
i bought from the store i got the compaq a special warranty where they'd replace it for any reason. 
gotta run, will check in this evening.
