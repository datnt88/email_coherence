okay. i've got an hp pavilion a6157c desktop with 2gigs ram, intel 4400 chip (2.00ghz). 
running vista home premium. 
i've had trouble with the last 2 hp's i had and returned them before the store warranty expired. 
no, i'm not a dedicated hp fan, just didn't have a huge selection to go by (costco). 
and it seems nowadays, most manufacturers are pretty equal. 
but each time i get a new hp there, the model changes. the first 2 (a1777c and a6077c both with vista home premium), ran on the nvidia geforce 7500le graphics cards. 
now, the latest model i have (a6157c), is running on the intel graphics media accelerator 950 card. 
why? 
what's the difference in the cards? 
why would they switch them out? 
if i find an issue with this latest hp, i'm done with hp.
