yes it is a sempron which is the stripped down amd cpu, just as a celeron is a stripped down pentium. 
they run just fine for most applications [the majority of low priced systems use celerons or semprons. 
yes more memory should be a big help. 
do you mean that an agp slot for a video card [not avg] is available. 
if so great, but don't get confused that most new video cards are pci express. 
check your bios if you can disable the onboard video, thus witha plug in card you will get the shared memory back also.
