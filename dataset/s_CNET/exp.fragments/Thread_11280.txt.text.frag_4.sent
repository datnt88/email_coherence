wal mart. 
get the memorex 25 pack colorful 8x dvd blanks. 
they are actually ritek, i have burned over 150 and not one bad disc. 
if you get a chance and are familiar with dos, check for firmware updates, not driver updates. 
if not sure read up and prepare yourself so you can do a firmware update with no problems. 
good link for info....
