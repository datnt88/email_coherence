ok, so you've got this huge log file, now what? 
you need something specific to search for in the file. 
for me it was a key that kept changing on it's own (apparently). 
hkey_current_usercontrol paneldesktopwheelscrolllines was my problem. 
i'd set it in regedit, then reboot and it wouldn't be the value that i had just set it to before the reboot. 
if this is your problem, the search that log file for hkey_current_usercontrol paneldesktopwheelscrolllines. 
you might even try just wheelscrolllines, as there shouldn't be too many registry keys with that name. 
best of luck. 
dog.
