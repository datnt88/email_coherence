hello, i will list system specs below. 
i have used nvidias bios update utility multiple times without any trouble, but today i went to flash the newest bios revision using the utility and it made my comp really laggy and it was freezing up whenever i tried to open some programs. 
so i figured that it was just the bios flash and that i would just flash back to the old revision. 
so i did so and then when my comp restarted it wouldn't post. 
i got out the manual and cleared the cmos according to the instructions. 
before i did so i got and error code 50, after i cleared them it doesnt even run through the codes and i just get a - - in the spaces and no post. 
i took out and put back in one at a time everything but the cpu, tried clearing cmos again multiple times, prayed, and nothing but the -- in the error code boxes. 
thank you for any replies and help!
