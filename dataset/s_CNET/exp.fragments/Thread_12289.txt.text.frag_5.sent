i tried that after posting and did get video using vga port, but still no video on netbook display. 
so i purchased a lcd screen, but only lighted screen and no computer image, still getting computer image using vga port. 
any other ideas, besides buy a new netbook or laptop( i like it because of its lightweight, i am not a gamer).
