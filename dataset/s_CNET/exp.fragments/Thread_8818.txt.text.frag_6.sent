you're forgetting one thing: the gpu fan gpu fans can be loud, especially if they're uber cheap. 
i had a client one time whose gpu fan ran decently quiet for a long time, and then the bearings in the fan gave out, causing a shriekingly loud screech whenever the fan spun. 
because she didn't need a high-end video card anyway, i swapped it out for a fanless, lower-end model. 
if your fan is making more noise than you think it should and you just bought it, you may want to consider taking it back, or perhaps asking a techy friend what they think about the noise.
