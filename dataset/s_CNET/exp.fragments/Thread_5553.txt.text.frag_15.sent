many hd vendors including maxtor provide a &quot;helpguide&quot; or manual in order to help you install the hd. if you didn't get one, then visit the maxtor support website and d/l it. 
while there review the limitations of the os, or what's required for the full install. 
understand also, once you get beyond the 39gb+ you seem to only get that the remianing gb's aren't going to ge 100% available, meaning some hd is loss to fat/ntfs handling and such, a small amount compared to the hd true gb size. 
this is all explained at the support website. 
if you haven't already, visit the dell support website as well, they too provide info ont his topic and probably rehash all said before on this thread. 
here is dell's link... locate what you need, naviagte abit, its pita, but its worth it. 
good luck -----willy
