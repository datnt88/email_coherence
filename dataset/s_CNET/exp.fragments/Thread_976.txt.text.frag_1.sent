1) are there any gpus available now that will allow me to take advantage of aero (or whatever that 3d vista desktop function will be called)? 
nvidia cliams that its geforce 7 series is ready for vista but... with vista so far away from release, how can they be sure? 
i plan to get a powerful gpu now and sli it later. 
but if i'll have to wait until the dx10 cards, then i don't want to waste my money now. 
2) what's the best way to connect 3 pata drives with only two pata ports? 
i'll have dvd-rw drive, dvd-rom, and a 300gb ata-100 hdd. 
i've heard that placing a optical drive and hd (master and slave respectably, or vice versa) will hurt performance.
