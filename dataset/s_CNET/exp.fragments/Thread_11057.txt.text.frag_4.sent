if you can rma after 5yrs. 
heck go for it. 
psu are strange items, i often post that they lose their &quot;phuumf&quot; after awhile. the other half is the mtrbd. 
and since logic is part of the &quot;start-up ckt&quot; something a user can't fix, a replacement mtrbd. 
may be the fix. 
however, as i stated it can be anything or a &quot;combo&quot; of problems.
