i have two external hard drives to which i regularly back up my files. 
on the smaller (100 gb wd)drive i store my windows onecare backup information (music, financial, and other data files). 
on the larger drive (500 gb seagate free agent) i backed up my entire c drive. 
this extra bit of caution came in handy this past week when i got the urge to upgrade my trusty xp professional to vista (what was i thinking?) after experiencing multiple problems with vista, i simply formatted and wiped my c drive, reinstalled windows xp and restored my c drive. 
had a c drive crash. 
since there's no easy way to &quot;downgrade&quot; from vista back to xp, i simply formatted my c drive, wiped it clean, and then reinstalled windows xp. then i restored my c drive without a single problem. 
every computer owner should have at least two external hard drives on which you schedule regular (at least weekly) backups. 
this is fairly easy if you just back up you c drive and then schedule incremental backups for any changes.
