i am not the happy owner of an hp 110-1030nr. 
imagine my surprise when walking through the px (military everything-type store) here in afghanistan and seeing it on display right after these posts. 
it came with an extended battery. 
i'm happy to have the extra battery life, but mixed on not being able to pack it without taking it off. 
but if that's the only downside, i'm sitting pretty. 
thanks for all of the help.
