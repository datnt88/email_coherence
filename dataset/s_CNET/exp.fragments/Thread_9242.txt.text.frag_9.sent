doing further research on the 2 cards requirements brought up this: 4670 = 4830 = my pc specs: the 4830 needs a 450w power supply and the 4670 a 400w power supply. 
if i were to get either of these cards, then would i be able to run them since i have a 300w power supply? 
and if i need a new power supply, what do you think of this: logisys computer ps575xbk 575w atx12v sli ready power supply (newegg $30)
