word from my developer friend is that the pc emulator is now very usable in the mactel developer machines. 
one can guess the speedup is that no emulation of the cpu's instructions must occur. 
there will be some pundits that will dig in and yell &quot;powerpc will be fine&quot; but given what i've seen i would not pick up a new machine based of the old cpu.
