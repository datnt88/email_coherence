i noticed you said you are only looking for a cpu? 
i'm not sure if you actually mean what cpu is an abbreviation for, which would be central processing unit. 
in case you did, then a great cpu out right now would be the intel e5200 dual-core processor. 
you can get it for about $75.00. it clocks in at 2.5ghz. 
as far as noise goes, it's virtually silent.
