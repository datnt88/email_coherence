thanks for the reply bob, yeah i initially was going to get an i7 just because i assumed it would be the best as its intels highest chipset but the more i looked into it the less and less important it seemed to be for gaming purposes. 
for hd video rendering and 3d modeling yeah sure, go the i7 but for gaming it just wasn't necessary i emailed the seller asking if he could supply a radeon 7870 but if not unfortunately the options only go up to radeon 7850. 
which is better out of the radeon 7850 and gtx 660 (non ti version). 
i'm reading a lot of conflicting reviews i'm not sure with the psu, i'm assuming they will look at the parts i will request and put in something that can handle it. 
surely they wouldn't give me a fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads psu when the rest of the rig will be somewhat power hungry because when it melts 2 days after they supply it i'll just be returning it...obviously not what a business wants.
