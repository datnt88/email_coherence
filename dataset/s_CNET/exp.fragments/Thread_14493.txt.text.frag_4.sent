&quot;i was going to get a pcmcia card with usb2.0&quot; you may have written this incorrectly but there has never been a pcmcia card with usb 2.0. 
god knows people wanted them. 
you also need to know that the e in esata is just denoting it's external so don't be discouraged if you find only the usual sata pc-card. 
i've declined in helping you search for exact products for a simple reason. 
you may be in peru. 
besides you can look at the usual sites like google, newegg and more. 
active cooling in an external hard disk case is ... &quot;a fan.&quot; again, the fancy words with such simple meaning.
