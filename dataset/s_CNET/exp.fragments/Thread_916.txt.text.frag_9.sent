hah! i've got somewhere! it turns out the bios is in fact the culprit! 
i started testing out different bios's, and when i flashed to the a00 bios, voila! 
both 255mb sticks worked, and memtest86 gave *no* errors!!! hah! 
now, i've got to see whether i can begin flashing &quot;upwards&quot; and determine at what point i lose the ability to use both modules!!! pretty weird! 
ran
