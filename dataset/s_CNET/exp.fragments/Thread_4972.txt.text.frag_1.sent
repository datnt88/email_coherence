i have a hp pavilion p6110y desktop pc. recently my power supply died on me. 
i bought a power supply which is 430w and installed into my pc which still works fine. 
i just found out that my old (original) power supply was 250w. 
will this increase in wattage be something bad for my pc or good? 
i haven't upgraded anything else. 
my old power supply fan was facing to the vent on the desk top tower but the new one which i installed, is facing inside the pc and not to the vent. is it something that i should be concerned about? 
your expert advice is much appreciated
