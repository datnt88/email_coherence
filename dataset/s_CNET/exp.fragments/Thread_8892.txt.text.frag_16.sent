all, being a tight wad, i'll do with what i ordered. 
lol i wanted the viewsonic 8 msec at $360 or so, but would have to wait to save up, saw the no name one with 10 ms and both d-sub and dvi at $209.99 and free shipping and 3 year warranty, took the risk. 
as you know, the lousy response time of lcd's does not really put a big demand on the time to generate pixels. 
fast refresh rate is not doable if the tft can't be turned off fast enough. 
do i believe this one is really 10 ms, not really, but probably better than the original 25 ms units that are still around.
