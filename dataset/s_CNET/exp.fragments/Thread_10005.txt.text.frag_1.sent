i have an radeon x1650 pro video card, there is an s-video on it, i want to know if it is in and out or just out s-video. 
i sent an email to amd, never an answer. 
i have seen two different answers to this, i do not have the disk to read the manual. 
i want to connect a video player to copy a couple of videos to cd. i want to avoid buying dazzle or other equipment if possible. 
thanks.
