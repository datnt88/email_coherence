i just talked to them and they said that adding a card wouldn't change the functionality of the pvr, so no need to buy a card with a tuner... the card that i'm thinking of getting is the ati radeon x800 xl pci-e. 
it seems to be pretty well received for the money, and i see that compusa has them in stock for 199.99... if i happen to find an additional rebate/coupon, it might seal the deal!
