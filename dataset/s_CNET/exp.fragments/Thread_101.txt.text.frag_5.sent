hi, thank you for the info about cleaning teh dust out of the computer. 
i have to admit, i had let that task go for too long and it was filthy inside. 
i also got a new keyboard a usb type as the one that came with the hp computer was a serial port type or a round one. 
so whether it was the dust or the need to use a usb port keyboard my computer seems to be working ok now. 
i then began cleaning up a lot of other things like windows temp files and internet temp files. 
i ran spyware, ad aware, abd norton virus. 
i did a security check and then fegragged the computer. 
my computer now feels like a new car! 
i am sure there are more things i could do like clean up the regesteries, but i am not astute enough to do that.
