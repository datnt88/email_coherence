i have an older dell (dimension 4100, 933mhz, 512mb ram from 2000) that i'm nursing along until i build a new pc. in the mean time, it's driving me crazy! 
when i start it, it boots fairly quickly, but the av (nod32) does a start up scan which renders the maching next to unuseable until the scan is completed. 
i just reformatted the hd, ran auslogics boost speed, which helped, but not much during the av scan period. 
when i check performance with windows task manager, the cpu is at 100%, ram about 60% usage. 
i don't have that many programs installed, and only the av, zone alarm, and system32ctfmon run at start up, according to msconfig. the startup folder is empty. 
doe you think the cpu is getting ready to fail? is my av that big of a resource hog?
