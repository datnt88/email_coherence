photoshop is optimized for quad cores, but other apps (like illustrator) don't show much benefit going from 2 to 4 cores because of thread synchronization issues. 
that's also especially true of most music software. 
they optimize for 2 threads but not 4. so a fast dual core (3ghz e8400) will outperform a slower quad core (2.4ghz q6600/2.66ghz 
q6700) in all of your apps except photoshop.
