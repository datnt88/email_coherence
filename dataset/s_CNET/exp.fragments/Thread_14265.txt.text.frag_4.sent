using a flash drive as a backup solution is not really a good idea. 
it's better than nothing at all but those things are notoriously unstable and prone to losing their data, especially if they are formatted as fat and not as hfs+ (the mac format) i would suggest that you burn a dvd of your itunes library and store it somewhere safe. 
dvd's are cheap so burning one a month is not going to break the bank. 
if you have a program like toast, it will will span the data across two, or more, dvd's if your data exceeds the capacity of a dvd.
