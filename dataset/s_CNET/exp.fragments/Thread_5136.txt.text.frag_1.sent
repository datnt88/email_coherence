ok i am having a weird problem. 
i've never needed to boot from my cdrom but i have windows 7 on a boot disk (i'm pretty sure it's burned correctly and it looks to contain everything needed when i browse it). 
when i go into the bios of my mobo to set the boot priority for the cdrom first it does not appear in the list. 
what is even more odd is that there is a floppy drive on the list although my pc doesn't contain one. is this normal or did i manage to connect something wrong and therefore it thinks its a floppy? the drive works perfectly when in windows vista so i am not sure what the problem could be. 
any advice? 
disc drive: lite-on dh-4b1s motherboard: biostar something or other i am running vista x64 sp2 currently and would like to upgrade asap lol ask if any other specs are needed. 
(i built it myself so i very well could have made a wrong connection when installing the drive but i don't know)
