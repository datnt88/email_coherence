it may be i need higher wattage. 
that apa10us is 70 watts. 
but definitly i'll probably go with a toshiba adaptor this time. 
it's too bad though because i wish i didn't have to change out my adaptors so much. 
maybe it's my computer's battery? 
or is there a proper proceedure of plugging an adaptor in that i don't know of. 
perhaps i should have always pluged in the adaptor first to my laptop then to the outlet? 
thanks for the help.
