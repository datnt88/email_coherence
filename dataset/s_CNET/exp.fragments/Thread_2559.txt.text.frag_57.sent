brandon: first; thanks for another excellent post. 
to answer your question about using a laptop; my brother installed 2 new computers in the house where i'm living; our late father's home in march 2006. 
he bought and had installed 2 new computers from dell's small business division. 
one computer is a dell dimension 3000 or 3100; the other machine is a dell inspiron 1300 notebook which i've used quite a bit to post in this forum. 
i've never had the experience of using a notebook before until now and with dsl in the house replacing my old slow dial-up service; the dsl is very nice. 
a router has also been installed which allows me to use the notebook wirelessly throughout the house which too is very nice. 
i spoke to someone at dell's home office division last week about configuring a dell dimension e510 for me; the configuration price came in just under $900.00 but since that time i've read some feedback on cnet from users who have e510's and most said the dell e310 was a much better machine although it had limitations if you wanted to upgrade it so i can't decide on which dell pc to buy but i will check out that machine by hp who by the way make excellent printers. 
one final thing; if i bought an hp pc and needed a replacement part; is hp like dell; would i have to purchase my part or parts from hp? again thanks for your comments.
