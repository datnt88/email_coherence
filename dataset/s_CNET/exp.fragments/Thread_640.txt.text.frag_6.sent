thanks for the links, masta. 
i just got back from bb (i hate that place. 
third time there, third bad experience with sales help.) so i was gonna shell out the extra $200 for the 840gm and i realized they jacked up the price to $1399! it was on sale for $1229 on wednesday and the tag said sale price good thru 08/13. 
i even got the sales guy to confirm this and i told him i'd be back to buy it this weekend. the guy today tells me their sale always ends on saturday and a new one begins on sunday. 
whatever! 
while i was waiting for some help i actually took a peak at an hp with media center and i really didn't like the way it works anyway. 
all those giant icons and step by step instructions on how to do stuff like play a cd or look at your digital photos. 
it's like they designed mc for complete retards! 
i guess it was a blessing in disguise that the sale ended. 
i'm gonna start re-shopping for another pc with xp home and just buy a tuner card. 
thanks again for the links!
