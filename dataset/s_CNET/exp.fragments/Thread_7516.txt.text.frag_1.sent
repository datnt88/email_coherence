i just got a new core 2 quad, q9550, to replace my core 2 duo, e6600, but when i installed it there is no display on the monitor. 
i checked to see if i installed it right, which i did, but still no display. 
i have since put my old processor back, and my computer works fine. 
anyone know what might be wrong?
