also there are those athlon based machines with the nvidia chip problem. 
no software is the cause for that issue. 
i can only guess why you would download chrome if it was running. 
but let's note this. 
chrome is a very nice browser that will eat a lot of ram. 
newer users might try to open many tabs and not understand why it gets slower or worse. 
i wonder if they will be the first ones to have 128 gb ram machines?
