i have a presario 5000us and would like to change the factory installed motherboard with a new motherboard/cpu combo upgrade. 
does anyone know a good motherboard that would be compatible with this compaq model. 
i am told there can be issues with power supply hook-ups and alignment. 
i can't spend a fortune right now and this looked like a good way to upgrade without buying an entirely new system. 
everything else on the unit is up to date. 
it is a standard a-slot, atx board with a 750 mhz duron chip. 
any help would really be appreciated. the hp site wasn't a big help? 
thanks, dave
