this might be worth looking into. 
had same problems with a similar setup. 
does that have shared video? 
like on-board? 
if so, try adding a different video card. 
that's what i found for the solution in my problem. 
i would be copying files, etc, and it with blue screen and restart. the minute i added a different video card, problems went away. 
was with an asus mobo and kinsgton ram as well. 
let me know.
