i wonder how it's used since laptops are often misused today such as putting it on some soft surface (blocks airflow) or it's the owner that selected a desktop cpu in a notebook form. the lesson about pentium 4 notebooks seems to be neverending. 
given the notebook issue, the same problems may follow to the next machine unless we discover what went wrong.
