thank you ramarc. 
of all the replies i have had on different forums regarding this subject, yours is the best and most practical of them all and the his 2600pro card you suggested seems like it offers everything i need for a lot less money than the others. 
i have a couple more questions though please. 1 - i assume the his 2600pro wont put any power consumption strains on my psu and also wont require an additional psu connection directly to the card? 2 - i don't see moir patterns, 'waviness', or ghosting from the dell running on the vga connection, the issue is only a slightly lower level of sharpness. 
this may or may not be improved from changing over to a dvi connection on that monitor, i guess that remains to be seen, but from what i read on another forum the sharpness issue may actually be related directly to the dpi rating of the monitor itself. 
i havent compared the dpi rating specs between the apple and the dell as of yet, but do you think this might be the root of the issue? 
3 the extra ram, by going from a 128mb card to a 512mb card, i understand will reduce the strain on the 2gb of system ram i have since photoshop is a ram intensive program. 
dont you think?
