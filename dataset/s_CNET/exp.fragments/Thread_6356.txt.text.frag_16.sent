while a high quality p/s units are available, they're just as good to get a hi-wattage unit. the prices being that they are, most users would rather go that route until they realize it made more sense to actually get not only a quality unit but a hi-wattage one. 
i recommend 350w too, but there are so many 400w+ and the typical user will be happy. 
500w units are readily available and come with dual fans, etc. to help keep the p/s unit stable, to include 400w units in the model line. 
excluding any quality issues, most 400w units do alright.
