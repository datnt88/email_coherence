it is my undestanding that teamviewer shuts off after you are through with the immediate task at hand so if he is going to grate your files while he's trying to help you,. 
you can deny him further access by turning off your teamview and barring tht posssibility , restart your computer while in the middle of teamviewer and he'll need your permission to get back on. 
now wayne , anyone who uses teamviewer has to have trust as i mentioned before so the issue is more how important is that file you need that he has versus how much is your own data you are trying to hide from him.klet's 
turn the question the other way around. 
suppose you have the info he needs and withholding trnsfer will cost your business a few thousand dollars. 
how important is the privacy issue?
