i recently tried to install vcom's fix-it utilities 6 on my son's emachine t1100. 
after i installed the program i had to do a restart and then i start getting a fatal system error message. 
he has been having problems with this computer and now he tells me he has had a virus on it for years now, he is not the smartest kid around. 
i tried to do a microsoft update on it and i can't get it to work because it can't verify the software installed on the computer as being genuine software, again the virus issue, he said he did something years ago to fix it and i don't know what he did. 
he has no idea where the original software is or any recovery disc are.(ask him where his xbox games are and he knows that,lol) any help is appreciated. 
i can't get it to boot in any mode (safe mode, normal,etc)
