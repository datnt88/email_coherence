hi, i built a pc a couple of years ago, with a gigabyte motherboard, ga-7dx, 1ghz amd processor. 
it has been working fine, until recently, when it refuses to boot up upon pressing the power button. 
initially i thought it may be a power problem, and indeed it still may be but i'm not sure. 
basically when i press the power button nothing happens except for a single green light comes on (a light on the motherboard) which i believe is the dimm led. 
so power does reach the board, but it doesn't boot up, any ideas? 
thanks adrian
