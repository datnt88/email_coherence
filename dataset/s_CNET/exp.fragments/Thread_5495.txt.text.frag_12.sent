it finally arrived. 
its a pentium 4 631. 
it's sl9kg according to the box. 
i forgot to look at the cpu. 
but it says so on the box. 
but its says 65nm according to cpuid.com. 
anyhow this thing is awesome. 
it says 18 - 20 c degrees in speedfan. 
and bios says about 25c degrees idol. 
not bad. and i even turned down all the fans. 
to low setting and i'm still getting those great temps. 
pretty cool for just a cpu change and nothing else. 
thanks, ivnj
