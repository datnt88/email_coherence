i was going through newegg looking for parts to build a gaming rig, and came across two processors, both intel i5's, and both 1156 chipsets. 
my question was, should i go with the quad core one at 2.8 ghz, or the dual core one at 3.2 ghz? the dual core is cheaper, and i have heard that the higher clock speed is better for games, while more cores are better for things like photoshop that are written to be cpu dependent. 
i'm sure both will work, but is it worth saving the $30 and losing two cores?
