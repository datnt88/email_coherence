to get an idea of the value of a piece of hardware, search for it on ebay. 
use the option on the side of the page to view &quot;completed&quot; sales as most stuff like this will not find any buyers. 
if you live in a craig's list area, that's probably a good place to try to move some of your old &quot;goodies&quot; since there is no listing fee or seller's fee on craig's. the ebay listing fees on this &quot;yesterday's&quot; equipment list will bleed you dry. 
perhaps a better idea would be to find some place that takes &quot;tax write off&quot; where you might recover a bit of yesterday's values.
