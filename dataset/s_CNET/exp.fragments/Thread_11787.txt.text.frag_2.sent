on-board sound will work but remember it uses the cpu to produce sound. 
i suggest a sound card to avoid stealing cpu power. 
creative labs is by far the most popular sound card out there but... there have been some reports of driver issues, my own pc suffers and there is no fix available. 
so unless you have extra-ordinary hearing i suggest one of turtle beaches offerings. 
these are available just about everywhere and you can even save a few bucks to boot. 
m-audio also make a good card but they start at about $100
