the ones from windows xp. i go into hardware devices under the system menu. 
then uninstall mouse and keyboard drivers. 
then reinstall both. 
then it works. 
cant be the ps2 ports themselves because they do work after the reinstall. 
not the devices cause they work fine on my other computer. 
i dont know what the deal is on the ps2 drivers in this computer.
