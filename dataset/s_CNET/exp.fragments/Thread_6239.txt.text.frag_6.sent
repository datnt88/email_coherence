are you sure this ever read less than 2 volts? 
perhaps it has been that way from day 1. before i chased this around i'd break out the dvm and see what it really is. 
maybe the sensor fibs. 
if the dvm shows 2+ volts and amd says 1.3 volts i'd call dell and ask&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how come? 
as mentioned.....you can not use non-dell software to tell dell they have a problem......it does not work....they go deaf.
