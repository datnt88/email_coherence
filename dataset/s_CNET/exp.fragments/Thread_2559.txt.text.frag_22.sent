nathan: first of all; thanks for the post. 
so you're sold on dell. 
well here's my next question. 
if you had a choice and you could; would you order a new dell desktop pc from dell's home office division or dell's small business division? 
someone told me to order from dell's small business division because if i did i'd have access to usa tech support where as if i ordered from dell's home office division i'd receive tech support from india or the phillipines. 
i was looking at dell's xps 400 desktop but do you think that model would be overkill for someone like myself who needs a new desktop pc simply for doing word processing; email; web surfing; and some quicken? 
if the xps 400 is overkill; would something like dell's dimension 3100 or 5100 be more appropriate? 
any idea what size ps's are in those dell machines without having to call dell? 
about you recommending to configure a back up recovery cd for the computer's os; dell also offers something by symantec or norton i think; if i choose to configure a new desktop pc with windows xp home; would the recovery disk for windows xp home be the right choice to select instead of the norton recovery cd? what's the difference? 
about that matter concerning the floppy drive; dell offers a choice of either an internal floppy or an internal 13 card media reader with a choice of also an external floppy drive. 
would you choose to configure the pc with the card reader then later purchase an internal floppy drive from someone like new egg to be installed later or would that cause problems with my dell warranty? 
about those extended warranties; do you believe in purchasing one and if so; for how long? for 1 extra year; 2 extra years; or 3? i'm not even considering the 4 year warranty because of the cost. 
about configuring optical drives; i've been told that 2 drive bays are better than 1. a dvd rom in drive bay #1 and a cdrw/dvdrw in drive bay #2. what's your thoughts on that?
