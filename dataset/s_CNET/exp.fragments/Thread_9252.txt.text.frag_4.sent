here'w why. 
if you mean that driver update button in windows, that is nothing more than a demo from my experiences. 
better than 1/2 the time it results in degraded operations or failures. 
microsoft does not produce your pc and can't get this one right. 
-&gt; use the drivers from your pc's maker. 
please.
