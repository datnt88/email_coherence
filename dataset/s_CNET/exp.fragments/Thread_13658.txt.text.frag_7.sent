some fall into a pit by doing this. 
1. install xp. their cd is xp. nothing more. 
2. install sp1 or later. 
3. add a drive, use it and then... 4. wipe the os and forget sp1 to regain access to the other drive. 
5. to seal the second drive's fate they often try disk repair tools before they install sp1 because &quot;they are looking to recover the data first.&quot;
