the reason for the incompatibility was traced down to a virus on the 95 boxes. 
but many forget this stuff. 
-&gt; the other workaround. 
go to bootdisk.com and get the dos boot diskette. 
create it on the xp box, boot that diskette and copy files to said diskette. 
done. the only issue i could see here is if the owner wasn't from 1995.
