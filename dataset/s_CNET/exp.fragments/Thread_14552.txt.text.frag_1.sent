good day, i am building a new pc and i purchased an aoc lm760 lcd 17&quot; lcd. 
however it has a d-sub connector only and my video card has both vga and dvi-i connector. 
the package contains a dvi to vga adapter. 
my question is will my lcd show an improvement once i have used the adapter to the dvi-i rather than the vga connector. 
i know that some lcd's do the conversion from analog to digital within their electronics, however in this case will the lcd know that it is a digital input it is connecting to or will try to use the analog circuitry. 
will i see a difference.
