yeah, i've had that problem... simple fix, really... go buy a can of compressed air, open up your side panel, locate heat sink, the metal grid-like thing above your cpu, and blast all the dust that probably got caked in there away... oh, be sure to shut down your computer so the fan isn't turning when you go to clean it out... see, the fan blows towards the heat sink... the cool air that's injected into the case, and all the dust, is then blown towards the heat sink which is a practically a magnet for dust... i've only had mine (which i'm typing back to you on) about a year ago myself... went through a move to new house, and it started doing this stuff... i recognized the same sound from my brother's xbox 360 that overheated (finally got that back) so yeah, compressed air blasting away all that dust from your heat sink does the trick... been running cool since... hope this helped instead of gettin a whole new computer, cans of compressed air at walmart, by the way, are only about 6 bucks a can? 
don't take my complete word for that, and last quite awhile... oh, make sure you use the little red tube that you attach to the nozzle. 
anyways, hope this helped!
