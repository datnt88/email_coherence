i have a lan-plus laptop with an amd athlon xp-1600+ 1.39 ghz processor & 112 mb of ram that's about 3 yrs. 
old. 
i purchased a wireless router & a wireless cardbus adapter. 
however, i didn't realize my laptop doesn't have a cardbus slot. 
my manual says it has a infrared data port that allows it to be wireless. 
what does that mean??? my device manager shows under network adapters a 1394 net adapter & a sis 900-based pci fast ethernet adapter. 
under infrared devices it shows a winbond fast infrared controller (dma). 
i have no idea what those are or what i need to do. 
all i want to do is surf the internet using my road runner! 
can i do this? 
if so, what do i have to do? 
any help is greatly appreciated!!
