you said it will print a test page. 
do you mean from it's built-in feature or from your pc? if it's just from your pc it won't work, it could be a driver, faulty port (parallel usually). 
give more details about how it's connected. 
i'm fairly certain these required an enhanced printer port setting in ones bios.
