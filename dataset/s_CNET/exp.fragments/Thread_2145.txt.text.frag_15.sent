dear kalli and bob. 
i've followed your conversation. 
this usb configuration problem with the printers and vista, is not an epson problem.i have exactly the same problem with a hp officejet on my vista laptop. 
this must be a vista problem. 
after all the research i've done, it looks more and more like a &quot;compatibility&quot; problem on vista's side. 
and the vendors like hp, supply the correct driver versions for vista, but there must be a configuration or setting somewhere in vista that's causing the problem.
