as noted, you should definitely go wired. 
you can go with either the router or modem/router combo. 
adding a router is the easier solution since your modem is already configured with your isp and you know it works fine with their network. 
you may have to consider the airport's compatibility though. 
you might have to make some adjustments to the airport's configuration settings if possible (e.g. turning off dhcp). 
if you're willing to loose the airport express, you could just purchase a wireless router to simplify the lan configuration.
