you can research and read web sites about &quot;how to build a pc.&quot; i don't duplicate such content but leave it to members to look for ready web content. 
why? 
these are self help areas and not tech support. 
however it helps to bounce ideas off each other. 
how did the test with just one stick go? 
and how are you doing with your linux livecd tests?
