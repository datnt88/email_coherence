i'm hoping to get advice on what the best/fastest cable modem/router device is? 
i currently have a motorola surfboard sbg6580. 
it works good, but it interferes with my direct tv so i can't use it and need to find another.... so, what is the best??? price doesn't matter. 
i just want the best one. 
thanks!
