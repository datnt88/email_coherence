no experience with fastmac upgrades but i support two b&w that were upgraded to g4 using a sonnet processor upgrade. 
500, 700 & 1ghz available. 
as you said, other than making sure that the firmware is up to date, there is not a lot to it. 
really is, plug and play. 
i just checked gigadesigns but cannot find an upgrade for the b&w. 
look for a decent speed, around double what you have now and remember that the g4 processor, when compared directly to the g3, will go faster for the same mhz speed. 
i think your options are becoming fairly limited due to the age of your b&w. it is a nice machine though.
