i too suggest lots of ram. 
add a 256 or better yet two of them. 
when it's up and running hit the ol ctrl+alt+del and check task manager under performance tab / pf usage. 
see how much it uses, if it's over 96mb then your using the hard disc as ram. 
you can trim it down by running msconfig and disabling stuff from the startup tab but i doubt you'll trim it down to stay under 96mb. 
heck i'm using 282mb with just firefox, yahoo messenger, avg, and a couple other small programs runnin but then again i have 1gb of ram. 
i don't see the point in partitioning the hard drive? 
if you trimmed the c which contains the os down too small it doesn't leave much room for the pf usage thus really making the system crawl or possibly lockup! 
my experience is xp and ntfs like big hard drives. 
you won't get fraggmented quite so much unlike with smaller ones. 
also i have yet to use a amd duron but i'd suggest a processor upgrade to an athlon. 
you can probably find a 950~1.2ghz for cheap on ebay or if i'm guessing the motherboard right possibly up to a athlon xp with 266fsb maybe even 333mhz? the l2 on a duron is a mere 64k vs a athlon 256k and a athlon with barton core @ 512k. 
also does the motherboard take ddr ram? 
if so circuit city has a mir deal on a 512mb stick. 
all else fails at least add ram and possibly reinstall windows. 
but remember if it's not a oem or retail disk then your probably askin for trouble. 
also you may have to call m$ seeing how they changed the mobo. 
i had a 1.3ghz athlon with 512mb/ddr 20 gig hard drive that was quite fast with xp, not much of a multitasker or workhorse but surfed the net and other general use quite fine.
