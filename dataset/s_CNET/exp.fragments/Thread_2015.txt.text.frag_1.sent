so i am currently running a dell xps 410 desktop with these specs: --intel&#174; core&#8482;2 quad cpu q6600 @ 2.40ghz --4 gb ram --nvidia geforce 7300 le --ocz vertex 2 / 500gb hdd -- everything else is stock. 
i want to upgrade my video card because it is realllly outdated. 
i was wondering what is a decent video card that will fit and not break the bank to hard. 
thanks to anyone who can help.
