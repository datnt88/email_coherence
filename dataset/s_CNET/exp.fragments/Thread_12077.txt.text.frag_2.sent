if there is a lesson that has repeated over the years is that storage is not &quot;storage&quot; but a copy. 
i can't guess how long you've been at this but when you wrote &quot;stable storage&quot; it makes me think you are just beginning to see the problem. 
keep at it. 
make more copies and your data may be safe.
