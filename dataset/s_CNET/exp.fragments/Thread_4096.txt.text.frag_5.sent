states 2gb which was why i was wondering if the total being 2048mb according to the bios for one stick at 1024mb was making it go over the limit and refusing to see the second stick. 
rather than fight this, i think my best bet is to just go out and buy one stick of 2gb from my local computer shop today...i can sell the 1gb sticks on ebay one at a time and recoup my money. 
lol thanks..........
