hi there. 
i have a dell 4600 with 74.5g memory. 
my problem: the drive is full and i don't understand why. it says i've only got 312mb left! 
i've not downloaded music or videos, and only some photos. 
when i check my system and data folders, they indicate about 20-25g each, so where's the rest? is there something i can do to access that or make additional memory available? 
are these junk files?
