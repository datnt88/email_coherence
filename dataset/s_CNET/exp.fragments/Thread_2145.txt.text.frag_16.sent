although i managed to install my r1800 on vista i cannot syncronise the colours visible on the screen with those printed - i tried to change gamma values etc, but still not satisfying. 
only when i got back to my good old xp it worked fine again. 
i had other compatibility problems with vista, for example my hp scanjet 5370c, hp can not be bothered to update driver for vista and advises to buy a new scanner instead. 
however, they provide &quot;good new&quot; for my colour laserjet 4550n but after downloading and installing the driver the images are all very bad quality. 
again, as soon as i installed it back on my xp computer it worked fine again. 
similar with partition magic 8, simply doesn't work. 
same with wincleaner 10, not working on vista. 
all very disappointing and i feel totally ripped off.
