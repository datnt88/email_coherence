while you can live with just a surge protector, battery backups aren't that much more expensive and give better protection which likely extends the life of your computer. 
sometimes things happen to your house current that cause lights to flicker or blink off and back on. 
surge protectors can't provide continuous regulated power during these whereas battery backups can and do. 
sometimes these momentary outages can be long enough to cause your computer to power off abruptly, risking damage to your data unless you have a battery backup. 
most battery backups have a usb connection which can do an orderly shutdown in case a power outage lasts longer than a few minutes. 
this is why i use them.
