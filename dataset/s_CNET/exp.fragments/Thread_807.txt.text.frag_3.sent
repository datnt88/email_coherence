those two phone jacks needn't both be used unless you connect a phone there also. 
if a phone is connected and it's the one causing a problem, because you mentioned you unhook one, it maybe the phone itself. 
for the sake of troubleshooting, use only one phone line there, maybe even a new one to test that also. 
if these phone lines are actually two separate phone numbers, use *only* one, that isn't the way it was intended for use. 
unless, you got some older &quot;shotgun&quot; modem that was popular a few years ago, in most cases most dail-up modems use one phone line.
