wondering on this. 
my dad says i need a laptop to take around and everything, like to show photos to family on trips, etc. i know that would be nice and everything, but we don't travel a whole lot. 
maybe 5 times a year to go to cincinati, since we live in lexington kentucky, and that's only for a day. 
then, maybe a large trip once every three years or so. 
now i'm also looking at the new imac's which i'm really liking the look of. 
they look awesome to me. 
i really liked the new keyboard. 
(just tried it today) i would like to get the 20in or 24in in either way. 
high or low one. 
to watch movies on in my room and the shows i buy off itunes. 
thanks treemen
