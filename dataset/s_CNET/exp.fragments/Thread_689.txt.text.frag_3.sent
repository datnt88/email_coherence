and have been using it for 2 weeks now. the print quality is great, but the setup instructions could have been clearer. 
there is a mistake in the instruction manual about sending faxes (reply to this if you buy the unit and want to know what it is and the correct way to do it). 
i realize that 2 weeks of use are nothing ( expect to get years), but once we've had this for a couple of months i'll post a review on epinions to help others. 
btw, the lowest price we found at this time was on the epson website.
