as big as you cna get is best! 
for a system like this i wouldn't go for less than 400w and if i couldn't afford this i would make concessions in the form of the dvd-rw to egt a larger power suply then buy this later. 
if you can afford it, go for the 500w, i wouldn't think 350 is enough but it's really a matter of judgement. 
not having enough power can cause your computer to turn itself off which is extrmly annoying ( not least becuase you losoe al unsaved work)
