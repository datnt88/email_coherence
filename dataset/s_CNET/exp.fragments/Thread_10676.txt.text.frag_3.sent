actually i just watched tom merritt talk about this app that led to my posting this question (something that has been bugging me since people have been bringing up having a camera for the ipad and stating that this is a bad thing on the part of apple for not including it). 
i am not looking for a app that does this. 
i am asking why would you want to do this using the ipad (it's dimensions make it impractical to use as a camera)? 
i stated my logic for this question is the previous posting. 
i am really curious for the reasoning people have for wanting a camera for the ipad (i mean a camera in the back of the device, not a web-cam [like i said earlier that makes sense]).
