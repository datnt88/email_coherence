the method i noted is &quot;the way&quot; and no sarcasm was intended. 
let me state that i will never rewrite a post to avoid a possible hurt feeling unless i feel it's just too harsh. 
here we want to nail your issue and if you've done it my way then we are quickly approaching the bad hardware issue. 
or there is a small item i have yet to notice in your posts. 
details matter no matter how small. 
since it looks like the hardware is doa it's time to call it's maker and arrange returns, exchanges, etc. in parting there is a test i do on such. 
i try to install linux. 
if that fails i sometimes gain some insight into what it was.
