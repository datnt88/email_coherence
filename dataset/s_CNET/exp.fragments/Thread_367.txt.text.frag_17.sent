i've had this problem.. usb devices powering, lan lights showing all good, but no power. the problem was i bought a flashy &quot;mod&quot; case for my computer.. it came with a 420 watt power supply and was a good deal at the time until the no power incident. 
i verified i had a full 110 volts from the wall. 
then i outboarded an old 200 watt psu to the mb and turned it on. 
all systems powered up. 
i removed the power supply that was included in the case and opened it up for a visual inspection. 
i was looking for loose wires/components and burned fuses. 
that was what i found.. a blown fuse. 
but for some reason the mfgr of the psu soldered the fuses directly to the circuit board so it was not replacable. 
i trashed the old psu and replaced it with a thermaltake that has fuse holders. 
this might help you. 
i hope its not your mb...
