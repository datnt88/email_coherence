i am buying a new computer because i want a faster cpu. 
i recently installed a new hard drive in my existing computer. 
my system runs great! 
can i simply remove the hard drive from the old computer and install it in the new computer as the master drive ??? both systems are running xp sp1. 
this sure would be easier and less time consuming than copying all my files and programs from the old drive to the new.
