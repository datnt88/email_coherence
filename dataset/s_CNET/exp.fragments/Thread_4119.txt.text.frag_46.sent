had the same problem on my nvidia 9400 graphics card. 
found out that the fan had stopped working and card was overheating. 
i would suggest you to install the software bundled with the graphics card to monitor card temperatures, you will find out if overheating is the problem. 
although i would not suggest it, this is what i did. got the processor cooling fan from an old intel motherboard, cut the wires from the graphic card power supply and replaced the fan with the intel one. 
works a-ok since then.the 
core temperatures never rise above the low temp range.....
