i tried a while back to reconfigure an excess sprint modem (zyxel) for use as a backup to my 5 yr old westie b90 (the predecessor to your c90, back when verizon was still bellatlantic and had you been using dsl at that time, as an exgte customer you would have had a fujitsu frame relay modem...). 
i could never get it to connect, no matter what i tried. 
i read on another forum of someone who had purchased on ebay a westell 2200 (2 versions after your c90) only to find that the variant of it used by swbell (which that fellow discovered later was the where the ebay seller had obtained it) could not be reconfigured for verizon. 
it was said that verizon does something unknown at the dslam which seems to put off a lot of modems not originally issued by verizon. 
you make the third &quot;victim&quot; i've come across. 
i'm sorry, but it just may not be possible to get that modem to work. 
unfortunately, the difficulty is that the modem manufacturer's general tech support teams have no idea what verizon's settings and requirements are, and the verizon tech support teams have no interest or useful information for helping you configure a device they didn't provide. 
you might continue to play with it, or take some other approach. 
btw, what did you mean by the ip addy doesn't work with media connect? 
also, by getting multiple ip addies, did you mean the wildly rapid rotation through addresses (every 15 minutes) that the west coast has been suffering from recently?
