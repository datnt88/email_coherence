no, i can't move to the window and do any better. 
as thick as i am, i'm smarter than that (if i could have done that i'd not be in this pickle). the antenna is in - or in the case of the hawking, connected to - my laptop, and it's not sufficient to see the aps available to me - but might well see some device on the pole outside (mounted well above me, directly overhead, basically), to which i can't connect physically. the senao gear doesn't have repeater function - or at least, their manual and the url-based setup makes no mention of it. 
and, i can't rely on knowing the ap mac in advance. the netgear rep claims their software will display that info - but having been burned once already i'm not anxious to run out and buy a couple hundred dollar item before having confirmation that it will, in fact, do what i need, particularly since there will also be some installation effort and costs. 
so... *without* physical connection to my computer or the physical access to the aps available (see original for expansion), can it be done; does the netgear do it (who's done it with that item), or failing that, what else? thanks.
