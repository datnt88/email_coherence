nathan: thanks for both posts; especially your first one in which you took time to address all of my questions concerning dell desktop computers. 
i read in another forum on a different website last night that dell plans to offer very soon another line of desktop pc's with amd processors. 
what's your opinion on that? 
are intel processors still considered to be better than amd's?
