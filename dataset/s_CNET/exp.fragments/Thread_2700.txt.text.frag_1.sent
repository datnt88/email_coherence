hi all, i've got an hp system running win98 that i've had for about 3 years. 
512mb ram, 30gb open on 90gb drive which was recently defragged. 
recently the system became very slow to boot and seems to stutter as it comes up. 
i'll get the windows background but then everything seems to slow to a crawl, mouse, if it moves, is very delayed and the system seems occupied with something. 
i noticed that the disk lite, usually full on when booting, only pulses once every few seconds. 
programs, with the exception of web access, seem to run fine. 
now any web access will bring the system to a halt. the globe icon will move in jerks every few seconds and the page will very slowly (5 minutes) load. 
other machines on the same router will access the web without problem. 
i should add that a week before the slowdown started, i had been trying to get the three machines connected to my router to talk to each other. 
i used microsofts network tool disk but was not successful in getting the win98, win2000 and winxp machines to share files or the printer connect to the problem machine. 
perhaps the problem is related to my attempt to network. 
any help on troubleshooting this problem would be greatly appreciated.
