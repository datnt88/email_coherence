whining sound, shuts down and reboots. 
that is eaxctly the problem i have had with mine since july of 2007. 
i lived at geek squad! 
they replaced the hard drive, video and more. 
never looked at a fan issue. 
that's beside the point. 
this is a design flaw - we are all being taken advantager of by best buy (if that's where you purchased and the problem started 2 weeks later) and gateway! 
bestbuy, geek squad and gateway are pathetic companies. 
they do nothing for the consumer of lemon products. 
bestbuy is trying to trade me down to a $600 budget pc. 
ridiculous after spending $1,050 in july 2007.
