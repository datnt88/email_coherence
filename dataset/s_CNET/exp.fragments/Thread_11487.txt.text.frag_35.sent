as i mentioned above, and provided links for, wpa/psk has only been broken in a case where a simple word key was used -- one that could be found in the dictionary -- and a &quot;dictionary flood attack&quot; was used. 
many routers will sense a flood attack and block it these days. 
but that's just the start of it. 
wpa/psk has not been broken in any other circumstances, such as where the password was something like a38fnn38aeaj38ayu322adeo. if it has, please provide us with a link. 
and wpa/aes is even stronger.
