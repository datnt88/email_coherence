hi, my names matthew. 
i know what your problem is, it's that your power supply is giving out to much power wich means you need a new power supply. 
now go to a computer store and say i need a new power supply for my computer and bring the ald one. 
give him/her the power supply and they'll give you the one that that maches your computer.
