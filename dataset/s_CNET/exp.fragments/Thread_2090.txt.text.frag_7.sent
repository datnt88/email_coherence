i suppose you are refering to the l1 l2 cache not getting flushed? 
i can see where some files could get screwed up in a situation like this but for the life of me i can't see no way in hades the entire system folder or more especially the windows directory could actually vanish off the hard drive. 
like it's poof they're gone. 
where can i find more info on machines not flushing the cache, bob? 
thanks for your responses by the way.
