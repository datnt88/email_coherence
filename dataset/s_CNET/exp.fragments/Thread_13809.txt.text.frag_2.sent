to people who might think i'm stealing (!): (1) i asked my next door neighbor and he said it's ok if i use his wireless connection! 
plus, (2) i don't do hard-core downloading or video streaming or anything!!! i only check my emails and make skype phone calls! 
also, (3) according to state law it's not stealing if the network is not locked! 
one more question: which router do you recommend for this matter?
