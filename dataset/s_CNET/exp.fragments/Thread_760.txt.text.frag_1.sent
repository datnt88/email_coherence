hope this is the right forum. 
so i recently got a new mouse(logitech g400 &lt;3) and it needs a loving friend. 
when on my computer, i'm generally gaming, so i want a keyboard more designed for that. 
i've already looked at a few, and they seem to get generally positive reviews. 
$100 or less.

your insight is appreciated.
