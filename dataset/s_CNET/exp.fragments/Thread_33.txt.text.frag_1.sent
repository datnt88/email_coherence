i just purchased a samsung 900df 19in crt flat screen. 
it says the max resolution is a 1600x1200. 
ans i have a radeon 9600xt which goes to 2048x1536. 
but when i choice resolution of 1600x1200 it stretches the screen out. 
so to get to the buttom of my screen i have to scroll! 
how do i change this?
