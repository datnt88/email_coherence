hi ramarc, i am upgrading from a ati raden 9200 se 128 mb so i will certainly see the difference. 
you are absolutely right why spend extra $$$$ when i will probably upgrade the whole system next year, pci-e needs a new mobo, mmmm a new chip mmmmm all a bunch of new goodies ..... lollllllllll thanks a million $$$$$$ again for your input, it was the kick in the butt i needed.
