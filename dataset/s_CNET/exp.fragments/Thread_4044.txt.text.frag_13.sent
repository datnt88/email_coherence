i've been meaning to post an update on here, but just haven't been able to find the time until now. 
i wound up calling microsoft tech support and they told me that they weren't even sure if what i wanted to do would even work. 
they suggested uninstalling xp sp2 and all the other updates, as well as my norton internet security and norton system works then trying the transfer, but there was no guarantee that it would work after all that and i still might wind up losing some data. 
so what i decided to do, is activate xp on the 30g drive in the ibm, then just run a restore on my backup (12 cds) into that drive and then do a wipe on the 60g drive and use it as the slave. 
this worked quite well, it was a bit time consuming, but well worth it! 
i am now on the ibm, i now have a piii processor, 384 mgs of sdram, the 30g drive as the primary and the 60 for storage. 
it has a built-in dvd rom as well as a built-in cd writer, which is nice, since with my old setup, i had an external cd writer. 
this is a vast improvment over my old system with the pii! and i only spent slightly over $200 in the process...not bad for a stupid plumber, eh? lol! the best part about doing the transfer the way i did, is that i was never down, i always had a functioning pc to access the internet (2 of them at one point!), which is good, because i sell on ebay and can't afford to be down for very long! in fact, that's what worried me the most, if something went wrong, i would have to go down to the local public library and use the public pcs to take care of business on ebay. 
that idea just doesn't sound good to me for some reason, lol! 
anyway, i just thought i'd let those that took the time to post and give me advice know that it all turned out well in the end and i really appreciate the help you gave me, thanks!!! scott
