i learned about this site from a customer. 
he was having a problem getting his router configured. 
when he called me to straighten out the mess he created, i asked him where he learned about networking, and he said he'd been reading some of the posts here. 
i thought maybe it would help having some advice from someone who has had training, but i see this place doesn't want it. 
you need to stick to your field of expertise, whatever that is. 
i won't be wasting anymore time here.
