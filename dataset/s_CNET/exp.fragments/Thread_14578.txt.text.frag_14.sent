&quot;jumper setting is per the drive manufacturer's instruction manual for a slave.&quot; 
i'd use cable select. 
these 80 conductor cables set that for us and right or wrong some machines get odd when we use the slave or master on 80 conductor cables. 
it's a safe thing to change, then i'd triple check that my motherboard drivers are current (no microsoft tools for this one i fear) and then i'd do the dma to pio and back to dma again... here's hoping.
