right, capturing video using software that (automatically) decrypts can obviously be done with a computer but not a dvd recorder, at least not at this time since the recorder does not (cannot) use such software. 
i suppose the manufactures don't want to be sued. 
as i said i think the law is a bad law mainly passed with lobby pressures so that you have to buy the same thing twice (without an option to back up what you paid for the first time). 
in my opinion that's greedy, and uses the same technology in large part that produced the product that you are prohibited to use to preserve it. 
in a sense that's wanting it both ways and a purely selfish, one way street. 
was the court was bought by the the marketeers? the law should be changed! 
as i mentioned to r. proffit it's something i might try (capturing with &quot;something simple&quot; and trans-code to dvd later). 
that's if i can't find a good, equivalent capture card with appropriate bundled software. 
still looking if anyone has suggestions. 
thanks to r. proffit and you for your discussions.
