a system that only uses pc 2100 ram is less likely to support a 1gb stick. 
sure there may be some that do, but at the time it was built 1gb on a stick was not a common item. 
you might look for a bios update for your motherboard that will support the larger memory capacity. 
that's is about your only chance to get the memory you bought to work to its full capacity.
