from what i understand of dfs it cannot utilize all the unused storage space that lives on windows 7 or windows xp workstations. 
it can only distrubute/replicate data between windows server 2003, 2008, 2012. 
i would like to utilize all that unused storage space on all those workstations. 
it appears dfs can't do that.
