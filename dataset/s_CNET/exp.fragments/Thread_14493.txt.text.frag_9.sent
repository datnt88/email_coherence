that indicated active cooling not to mention the cost...yikes. 
if it was mine, i'd try to find a pcmcia card that gives you usb 2.0 and buy that. 
generally speaking external hdds are really quite inexpensive ...see techbargains.com 
for weekly ads. 
you can also 'build your own...you pick the external enclosure and the drive and put them together yourself. 
let us know if you find the pcmcia usb card...usb 2.0 is plenty fast for most hdds.
