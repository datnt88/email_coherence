i intend to purchase an internal storage hard drive for my computer. 
win 7, 3.0ghz, pci express on motherboard, sata ii. i am looking for ~500gb capacity; i already have a 250gb drive connected externally with a cage. 
i assume their would be no problem connecting a 2nd storage drive. 
i believe 750gb total storage would be sufficient; 1tb drives appear to be beyond my budget capacity. 
i have seen drives labelled as &quot;sata 3&quot;. 
does this mean it is an esata drive, incompatible with sata?? i was told sata and esata are incompatible. 
an esata drive is capable of 3gb/s transfer speed. 
my external drive cage is capable of esata connection. 
thus i require verification of which drive i should purchase.
