i guess what you really need to do is ask yourself what you mean by expensive? 
i know that expensive for me may mean something completely different for someone else. 
basically i need more information to help. 
are we talking a $600 computer that will play newly released fpss at max level? 
or are we talking a $1500 computer? 
i really don't think designing and building a computer is all that hard, just take your time and research each component thoroughly. 
it's a great way to learn and there are many forums available that will help you check the compatibility of your components.
