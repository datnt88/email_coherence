you'll like the i3 or better cpus since the dual core with ht shows 4 cores and works very well to keep it all in sync. 
you should find folk complaining about hd playback on older single core machines. 
700 should be fine for a new system so shop till you drop (i can't tell which country here) and one last tip. 
-&gt; most machines never come with restore media so always create them when you get the machine.
