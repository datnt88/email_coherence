i'm going out on a limb here, and am not sure if this is the right forum... plz correct me if i am wrong. 
ok, optorite dd0201 burner, princo 1x media (yes, i know, thats 2 strikes against me, dont remind me), and yes, the media is supported by the burner. the problem is, is that i have failed 8 out of 15 burns. 
it burns the full disc (using nero 6 of course), but then, when i look on the disc, there is &quot;nothing there&quot;. 
if i look at the disc using a program like dvdinfopro or alcohol 120%, it sees that there is information on the disc, but still does not know what it is. 
... uh, why? 
whats going on... i cant figure it out. 
i get this problem when either ripping a dvd or burning data to a dvd. 
i have also noticed the problem when burning hd-burns (look it up, its similar to overburn, allowing you to stick 1.4 gigs on a single cd). 
plz help.
