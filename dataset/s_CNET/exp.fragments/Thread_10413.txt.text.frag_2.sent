if you can get me the model numbers (generally found on the stickers on the bottoms of the equipment, or sometimes on the faceplate), i can get you links to the manuals. the model number is generally 3-5 letters followed by 1-3 numbers, sometimes followed by another letter... examples are befsr41, wap54g, and the like. 
with regards to the other computer trying to connect via wireless, you say &quot;across the parking lot&quot;. 
have you confirmed that this computer can actually establish a signal with the wireless access point? 
through walls and such, i've found that the maximum operable distance for 802.11b/g is around 75-100 feet or so (especially if there are other access points in the area creating interference).
