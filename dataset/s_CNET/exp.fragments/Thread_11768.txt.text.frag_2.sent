aside from that here are some things a pc needs: motherboard - the basis of the system, everything is connected to this power supply - don't skimp, you want a good unit from ocz, antec, forton source, enermax, or ttgi superflower, as this powers the computer, and is often the most common source of problmes cpu - this does the majority of data processing in the system, again, don't skimp gpu - here is where your graphics are done, pcie or agp 8x, this depends on the motherboard/cpu combination you choose hdd - hard drives, your storage, how much you need? 
ram - memory, i suggest at least 1gb, running in 2x512 (2 512mb sticks, thus, dual channel (if you have a dual channel motherboard) and pc 3200 or faster (pc 3200 is what you need to run 1:1 with basically every chip out there (yes, including the 800fsb intel chips) but you can get faster ram if you'd like (no need unless your overclocking)) i'd suggest some of the following parts: abit an8 $144 @ newegg amd athlon64 3800+ (socket 939) $380 (oem) or $385 (retial) @ newegg thermalright xp-90 $49.99 @ newegg (get a 92mm fan for this also) 1gb (2x512) pc 3200 ddr: geforce 6600nu pcie and your choice of sata hard drives for the psu i'd suggest one of the following: antec neopower 480w ocz powerstream 520w as for a case you just have to pick one you like same goes for optical drives, just pick one/ones with features you like and you also have to choose if you want a floppy drive
