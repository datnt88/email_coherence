i just ordered the elder scrolls iv: oblivion for pc before i realized that my pc may not be up for the job. 
i looked at the computer requirements for oblivion on their web site then went to and sure enough my computer does not have the ram (i have 447.4 mb) or video card (i have nvidia geforce4 mx integrated gpu) it recommends. 
it said the cpu (amd athlon(tm) xp 3200+) was o.k. but i feel like i need to get the latest and greatest (the amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core 6000+ looks nice). 
i also read somewhere that i cant upgrade my compaq because some issue with the built in psu. 
ram isnt really the issue for me, its the video card...there are so many and the only thing i know what to look for is one that has agp. 
so my question is: should i get rid of my good 'ol compaq for a custom computer or should i and could i upgrade it?
