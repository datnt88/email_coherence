i am planning on purchasing a netbook and cnet recommends this model. 
when i went online look at prices, there were different numbers after the 1005ha and i don't know which one to purchase. 
i want to purchase one for the lowest price. 
i was told when you purchase electronics through tiger direct, etc. it may not be new. 
thanks!
