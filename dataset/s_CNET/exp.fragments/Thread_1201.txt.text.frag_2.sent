usually a blurry screen is the result of the monitor itslef. 
to verify this find another monitor and hook it up. 
if the other monitor does the same thing you might try updating your video drivers or getting a new video subsystem altogether, but i've never heard of a video card getting blurry, not to say it can't happen.
