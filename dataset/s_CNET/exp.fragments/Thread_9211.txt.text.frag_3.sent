check your network setting on both systems...the ip's need to be the same up until the last set of numbers which should be one off... for example: new pc: xxx.xxx.xxx.100 old pc: xxx.xxx.xxx.101 then make sure the subnet mask is the same on both. 
use your winxp cd to setup a home office network on both machines...while doing this you need to name both machines (ex. 
oldpc and newpc)and name your workgroup, this must be the same on both machines, (ex. 
home). 
now go to the folder(s) on the old machine and right click on the folder you want to share...then click on the option for sharin and allow sharing. 
reboot and go to your network on the new machine. 
you should see oldpc on your network. 
you can now access the files on the shared folder and cut/copy them to your new machine... i did this from memory but i'm pretty sure these are the steps i took last week... hth.
