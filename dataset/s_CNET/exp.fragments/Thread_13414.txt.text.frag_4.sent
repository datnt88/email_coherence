auggief hi try this, also anyone else who has the same problem with there startup and shutdown sounds in xp. click start, click run, type regedit and enter. 
click on hkey_current_user to highlight it, then in the right plain where it says (default) reg_sz value not set right click on (default) click delete and your problem hopefully will be sorted its an easy fix usually happens after a bsod or a faulty download, if your not sure about changing things in your registry than i would recommend you back it up first before doing anything, but like i said before its an easy fix and if you follow what i have said you should be ok.
