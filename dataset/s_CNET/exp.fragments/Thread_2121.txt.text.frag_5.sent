your post doesn't tell enough but there are a few clues here. 
1. you might have recycled another power supply and it does not meet the needs of this cpu and board. 
2. i see this has a 4 pin atxv connection. the symptoms are what happens with that is not plugged in. 
3. some boards come jumpered in clear cmos and won't start. 
4. one board had a typo in the book about the reset connection. 
long story short is the motherboard printing was correct.
