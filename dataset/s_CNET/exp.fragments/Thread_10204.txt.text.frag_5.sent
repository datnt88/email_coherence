good to know how did you narrow choice to these two particular tablets. 
i guess it was form factor, many people think that 10 inches too big for tablet purpose. 
and i have to agree here. 
however 7 inches tablet niche is wide, you can check also amazon fire and sumsung galaxy 7.7. 
but returning back to your question playbook is currently $300, but it doesn't have external sd slot thrive will be available in december most likely for $450 and hard to buy, however i would strongly consider it, because better screen and sd card slot.
