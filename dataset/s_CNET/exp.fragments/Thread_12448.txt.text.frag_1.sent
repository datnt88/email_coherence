i have set up a shared wireless internet connection between my 2 computers and can't figure out what i exactly need to share files, printer/scanner. 
here are the facts: 1. my dsl modem is also a router, with only 1 ethernet port. 
it's this one: 2 my main computer is a pc with windows 98se, and i installed a pci card + cable to be able to hook it up to the modem. 
3. my other computer is a notebook windows xp. the internert wireless connection works great. 
so how do i go about setting up a home network? 
get a small router with 4 ports, and hook it up to the modem, scanner, printer? 
any advice is highly appreciated !! aude-noelle
