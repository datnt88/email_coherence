thank you, spartan, for your reply. 
i was using aida32 and speedfan to monitor the cpu. 
i now have side panel on the pc partially open. 
i installed motherboard monitor. 
what a neat program, still need to learn more about it. 
i rebooted and read the temp with all utilities one after the other: bios- 53c, speedfan- 52c, aida32- 53c, mem- 56c. 
seems high but safe? 
someone shared this site with me: . the boss is not concerned so i guess i shouldn't be either. 
thank you for the advice and the link to mbm.
