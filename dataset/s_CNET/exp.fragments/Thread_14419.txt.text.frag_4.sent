(1) try to clear the cmos. 
there is a cmos jumper (2 or 3 pin header) on the motherboard. 
e.g. for a 2pin header, closing the pins could clear & open could be normal function. 
depending on what motherboard you have got, the story could be the other way round. 
(2) check your memory. 
if the memory is short, the pc turns for half a sec & stops. 
(3) remove the cpu. 
put it back after 2 to 3mins. 
(4) try another power supply unit.
