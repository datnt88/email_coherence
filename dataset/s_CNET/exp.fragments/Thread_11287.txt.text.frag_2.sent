it seems to be some cruel joke that radio shack and many other places sell such adapters.

i've never seen such work. 
do describe in gruesome detail the make/model number of said mouse so i can see if it is indeed serial capable. the switch to use an external mouse is far from automatic and you may need some usb or ps2 mouse to make this work.
