for the desktop workstation running officexp, any pc will do. 
for the cad station, here's my suggestion for a upper-mid range setup. 
you'll need to budget about $4300 but it includes dual-core processor, 4gb ram, cad accelerated graphics card, 500gb disk space, 23&quot; widescreen monitor, a tabloid/b size printer, and xp pro and office 2003.
