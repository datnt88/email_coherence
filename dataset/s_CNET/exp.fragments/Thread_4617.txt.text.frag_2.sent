some scanners have an adapter for scanning slides and even negatives. 
they have to capture light passing through and not reflected from an image. 
they also need software to accommodate this kind of scanning feature. 
i have used such and my old hp 5470 has a slide/negative adapter. 
i can tell you that the quality is only so-so but it does work.
