hi, i had exactly the same problems, due to sp2. 
what's strange is that the problem only manifested itself on certain routers. 
ok anyway, the solution was to go to my network places, and on the left click &quot;hide icons for networked upnp devices&quot;. 
there is probably another way to disable this constant searching, but using the common task pane worked for me. 
hope it helps someone.
