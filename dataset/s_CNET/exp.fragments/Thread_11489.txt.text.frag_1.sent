i found this on craig's list (yes, i know...)i am wondering if you fine people could advise me on whether or not this would be worth the $360. 
it's custom: amd athlon 64x2 6000+ 3.0ghz dual core processor 2x2gb ddr2 1066mhz ram by gskill evga nvidia 9500gt 512mb video card with dual monitor support 80gb 7200rpm sata 2 3.0gbs hd lg dvd burner w silent run tech. 
gigabyte mid tower black light gloss case antec tricool 120mm rear exhaust fan with 3 speed switch ecs 8200a motherboard with hdmi antec smartpower power supply rated at 400w here is where i found it: any help would be greatly appreciated. 
also, i was informed the graphics card is about mid-level? 
as far as cards go. 
and the psu isn't very good. 
i am not big time gamer, but i would like to get into it a little. 
would it be worth buying this, and then buying a new graphics card/psu? 
i also have a 19&quot; hd monitor and 160 gb hdd that i can throw into it.
