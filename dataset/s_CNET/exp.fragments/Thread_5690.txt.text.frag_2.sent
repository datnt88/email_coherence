you should learn what compaines are good and you should find out what your system needs odn't just go on wattage i'd take a good 350w over a no-name 450w because the 450w will provide less power, and not work aside from taht if you just want to get a suggestion i say antec neopower 480w and that price is around average for a good mid-range psu (mid-range is 450-500w)
