i'm tired of moving my notebook around and i'm about to set my outlook to work based on the external hard drive and have all my docs there. 
i would be moving far less weight. 
i was thinking of getting a disk with a firewire connection so it goes faster. 
would like to know if anybody has tried it before and how it worked...
