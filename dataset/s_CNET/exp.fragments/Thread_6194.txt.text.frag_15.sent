okay, good to know. 
one more question though: the connection is nice and stable now, and i'm able to do transfers and downloads well. 
like i said, it is much better now. 
as it is, i can definitely live with it. 
but it's still not nearly as fast as the wired computer---download speeds are varying wildly between 10-200ish kb/s, unfortunately being usually more towards the low end (as opposed to a pretty constant 500+ for the one wired to the modem). 
i understand, again, that this is to be expected to some degree, but how much of a difference should i be seeing? 
and should it really be fluctuating that much? 
also, is it unrealistic to expect that i will be able to get decent latencies (say, to game servers---the idea was that hopefully this computer would be useable for gaming) on any wireless connection, or is it just a peculiarity of my setup? 
just wondering if this is normal.
