i have a 24 inch lcd with a matte finish lcd and a 17&quot; laptop with a gloss finish lcd. 
i really like the 24 in lcd with the matte finish but really struggle with the gloss finish lcd on the laptop as it seems to reflect almost anything from anywhere. 
i'm talking about matching the general monitor specs... dot pitch, viewing angle, contrast, color depth, etc., as the starting point to find lcds that match mac lcd specs. 
like you ...i can't fathom there aren't lcds made by mfgs that aren't as good or better than those made by apple. 
pink polka dots on the frame ? 
.... think i'd find those distracting too. 
good luck and let us know what you decide on.
