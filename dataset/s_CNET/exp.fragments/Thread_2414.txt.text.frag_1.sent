ok i'm new at this and after debating for a while i want to upgrade my dell xps 420 (that's a few years old), i'm looking to put some money into it. 
right now everything is stock, intel quad q6600 2.4ghz cpu, 500gb hd, 3gb ram, 375w psu w/ dual 12v rails @ 18a each, and a radeon hd 2400 pro (32-bit vista). 
i found out that i have a dell otp406 mainboard/motherboard with x38 chipset. 
i'd like to oc my cpu to about 3.0-3.2ghz, 
but i think my bios is locked, is an over-clock even necessary? 
so far my plan's are to reformat the hd and install windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit) home premium, add 1gb stick ram, put in a corsair tx650 watt psu that has a single 12v rail @ 53a and decide on a mid-range gpu (msi 560ti?). i ultimately want to connect this pc to my 40&quot; 1080p lcd tv via hdmi, will a screen that big cause problems running a proper resolution @ x1080? 
i'd like to be able to play game's such as skyrim, bf3, crisis etc...with possible mods on high-ultra. 
will this work? 
i want to try and keep this mobo/cpu. 
any input/advice is greatly appreciated, this is my first attempt at a pc hardware build/upgrade any help is huge, thank you in advance.
