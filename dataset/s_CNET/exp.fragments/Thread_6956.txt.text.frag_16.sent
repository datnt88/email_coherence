thats good news about being able to update the bios in windows. 
also thanks again for pointing me in the right direction for the mobo. 
i'll definitely be getting the asus mobo. 
i just have one more question and then i'll stop bothering you lol this psu has a 20 + 4 pin main connection however i can't seem to connect them together. 
i have a second 4 pin connector that is presumably for the cpu. 
i was wondering if the 20 + 4 was supposed to clip together or if i could just put them in seperately. 
thanks again for the help. 
can't wait till conroe hits. 
:):)
