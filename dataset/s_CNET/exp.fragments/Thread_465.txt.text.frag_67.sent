i have a toshiba laptop, 4 gigs ram and 320 gig hard drive. 
it has dual 2 core, so is fairly speedy even with vista. 
i've had no trouble with computer, but sure have had trouble with vista. 
pretty much love the laptop. 
also have (business requires extras) an hp laptop about 2 years old, which has had some repair problems, and an older fujitsu that i've never had a problem with. 
both of them have xp. both are laptops. 
i travel, so need portability.
