i have a pny gforce 4 mmx 420 se 64mb pci. 
this card requires a 250 watt power supply but all i have is a delta electronics micro atx 90 watt with a 124 watt max output. 
my question is can i damage my card without the proper wattage. 
if i were to upgrade to a higher wattage power supply would i notice any performance increase. 
i believe with a micro atx all that is available is up to 180 watt. is this true? 
or could i find a 250watt micro atx power supply.
