couldn't i just replace my nic cards with wireless network cards? 
then and i can run the network the exact same way as i do now through win xp network with microsoft ics. 
i don't have any wireless cards now, so the wap11 would not be of any use. 
i am new so if this is a stupid question, please dumb down your answer. 
thank you, dennis
