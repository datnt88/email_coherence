greetings all. 
second time here to the forums. 
i posted a question on one of the other forums and i have to say that the help that i received was wonderful, so i thought i'd post this question in the hopes of finding an answer. 
i'm a newbie with regards to building or upgrading a computer. 
so please forgive me if my question seems a little dumb. 
i've decided to upgrade a computer by adding a new hard drive & additional memory. 
my mobo is an asus p3b-f. 
it is a pentium ii, 350mhz. 
my question is this. 
taking into account that my prossesor speed is 350mhz, does that restrict me in the size of hard drive & rpm's that i choose or in the amount of memory that i add? 
i'd like to add a 80gb hard drive at 7200rpm's and 256mb of ram. 
i'm already aware of the capability issues as far as connection-ide etc., but as for the above question i'm a little confused. 
with thanks
