hi thanks for replying. 
now that you mentioned it, i don't recall seeing the safe mode message in the corners...so it could be the video card (it's not onboard). the beep ocurred only once when i was using ie, then the screen went black for a couple of seconds. 
i run scandisk regulalry and it hasn't reported anything. 
btw, will xp ''know'' if a monitor is defective? 
i've used xp on a defective monitor (colors all pink) and xp didn't show any error messages. 
again, thank you for your suggestion about reinserting the video card. 
regards,
