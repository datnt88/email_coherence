i currently have a dell inspiron e1505 with a 120gb 5400rpm hard drive and want to go up to something bigger. 
my choices are a 250gb 5400 hd and a 200gb 7200 rpm hard drive for about $35 more. 
is the speed of the 7200 fast enough to really make a big difference to my system to compensate for less space?
