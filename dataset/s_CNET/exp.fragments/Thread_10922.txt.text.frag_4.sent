but my initial thoughts are... 1. no mention of the gritty details. 
make/model laptop and most important, who installed that os. here's why. 
most will install the os but laptop drivers are not something microsoft will install. 
2. if the product is defective. 
return it. 
3. try linux. 
use google.com and see if dsl (damn small linux) can use that card.
