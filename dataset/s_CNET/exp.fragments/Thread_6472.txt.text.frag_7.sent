dla is a form of formatting that enables the optical drive to work like a big hard drive or floppy disk. 
when you &quot;copy files&quot; to the optical drive you are burning them but they will only work on that pc. that &quot;make comatable&quot; option is supposed to make the optical disk compatable with other pcs. 
it's not. 
as bob said, uninstall it or use standard burning techniques. 
do you have a burning program?
