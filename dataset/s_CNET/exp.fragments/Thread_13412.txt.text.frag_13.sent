the problem with leeches is that they can do nearly everything they need to do through the web ports, which you will need to leave open in any event. 
blocking those ports will prevent other abuses, so it's still a good, albeit partial, solution. 
(port 8080 is generally used for websites under development, though, where they are usually only to be viewed by the developers themselves, so you may not need to unblock it). 
secure it with wpa2 and use a passkey. 
provide your customers with the passkey on request. 
of course, this won't address the issue of a person who has in the past been a customer becoming a leech, but you can deal with this by creating a new passkey each morning or so.
