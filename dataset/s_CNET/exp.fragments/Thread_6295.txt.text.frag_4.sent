i have a pci card installed. 
i also have another pci card with both rear case and one internal usb socket. 
what i really want to do is install a front case card reader with a usb port. 
i have looked high and low for an internal reader and i can not find one that does not connect to the 9 pin hub on the mothjer board. 
they all have the blocked pin on the wrong corner of the connector.
