as for it's usb 1.0, it says &quot;enhanced&quot;, so i guess that means 2.0?, even though my pc is kind of old. 
i did what you mentioned, and everything seems normal. 
the usb section is also fine (unless if there's something specific you want me to check), and the usb is recognizable in the disk drives section. 
it says (acpi multiprocessor pc) under the computer section. 
can you please instruct me in how to set bios to be shadowed. 
and do i need to change the bios order and put usb first?.
