i want to buy a new lcd, but i do not know which ones to buy. 
i would like to know if contrast ratios and response times are important. 
and if they are, what should their values be? 
i am looking to buy a benq fp937s 19&quot; lcd, 12ms response time, 500:1 contrast ratio, 250 nits brightness. is that a good choice? 
i will be using the monitor for basic computer use, (web surfing, watching dvd's, word processing, etc.) and some light gaming, (half life, counterstrike, etc.)
