any i3 or better, 4gb or better with a video card with dedicated video memory with hdmi and the dvd player and of course windows 7 should be fine. 
wifi is nice but can be trouble for some if the distance to the wifi router is too far. 
it's all about location and what's between you and the router. 
it rarely is the hardware choice unless it was some rare 2 dollar thing. 
windows 8 might be ok if we add the start button back in. 
for example and there are others and free ones as well. 
we'll get a few windows 8 machine just in case we get asked if our apps run on it but for now we see that windows 9 will be fine. 
for me i went simpler with an amazon kindle fire hd 7 to the hdtv but this falls short on what you want to do but i thought i'd toss this in. 
with that out of the way, let's look at the top sellers at amazon.com for desktops. 
stores have drank the windows 8 kool aid so my bet is you may not get what you want there. 
-&gt; at number 2 i see so read the buy comments and see what you think.
