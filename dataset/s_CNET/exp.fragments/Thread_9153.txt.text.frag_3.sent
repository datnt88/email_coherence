hey jconner thanks for the info. 
i looked at the newegg reviews and the qualified vendor list. 
now one of the reviewers stated that he was happy about the board supporting 8 gb, but didn't mention clearly if he actually had 8 gb on it. 
now my question becomes: even if the system does not have a problem recognizing 8 gb and shows 8 gb, how would you know if the system is ever using the second 4 gig pair when the first 4 gig pair is used up ? 
in other words, is it even theoretically possible for the system to ever use the 2nd pair of 4 gigs without intel emt support ? 
it says on the intel qx6800 prod. 
brief .pdf 
file that emt requires supporting mobo, bios, and os. any ideas ? 
thanks again
