hello everyone, i didn't mean to snub free devices and solutions and i am not a millionaire, if free devices would solve everything, how shall i spend one cent for the paid ones? 
anyway, thanks for your focus on the important copying solutions. 
btw,i see in websites talking about hard drive duplicators, disk imager, data copy tools, any differece among them or they are actually the same thing.
