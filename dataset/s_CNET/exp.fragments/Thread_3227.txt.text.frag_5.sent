i just want to look up on the internet for locations to plug into my garmin. 
like today i was out of town and wanted to find a dog park. 
but gps isn't that detailed and up to date. 
i don't have a budget. 
i'm learning toward the ipad2 wifi only. 
i suppose it does the most and has to most accessories? 
why would i want 32 or 64gb? is ipad the best? 
are the others comparitable? 
if i just go w/ the ipad can i ignore the rest?
