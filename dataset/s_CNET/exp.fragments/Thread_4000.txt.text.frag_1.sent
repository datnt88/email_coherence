hi there, i've just installed a new wd 500gb sata hdd in my computer. 
what i would like to know is if and how i can transfer my system (xp pro) from my ancient 13gb ata c: drive onto the new fast, larger drive so i can use the sata drive as my c: drive without having to reinstall xp and loosing all my settings and associations. 
thanks, calamity
