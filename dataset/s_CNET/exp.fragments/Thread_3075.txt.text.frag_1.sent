i'm looking for a new flash drive and would like some suggestions. 
i currrently have a 512mb cruzer titanium which is now not big enough (i got it because of it's speed). 
i am looking for something that has a 1 or 2gb storage capacity. 
i like the &quot;new&quot; cruzer titanium but don't know if it is any good.
