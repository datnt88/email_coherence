when i run across a problem like this, i simply replace the psu with a good one that's quite capable. 
if that fixes it, great, mount a new one. 
if not, then you have a case of &quot;bad caps&quot; or poor solder joints. 
a system as you state can result from what i've explained, it basically gets flaky and weird or freezes and/or hangs. 
if everything checks out, the mtrbd. 
is the root of the issue or part of it. 
this can happen from either being an old sysetm, cheap one or an over-stressed one from heat. 
you can test wiring if you like and check voltages, but best with a oscilloscope rather than a meter for any noise noticed as well. 
it gets to a point where it costs more to work on it than a repair, so explain it all should it come to that.
