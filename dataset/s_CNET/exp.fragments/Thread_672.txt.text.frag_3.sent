just wondering. 
also since you posted in the networking and wireless forum if any are wireless be sure to use wpa, leave ssid enabled or it will drop!!! if you feel this is incorrect i invite you to call all the makers involved to ask for a fix. 
in closing i found such an issue many times was something simple. the person who setup their lan forgot to put the routers and network switches on battery backup units. 
i've also found the occasional bad wire, bad ethernet crimp that would disconnect as the door slammed. 
that took weeks to find.
