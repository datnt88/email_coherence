others have answered your ram question better than i can, although i do concur--add more ram yourself if you feel you really need to. 
i have been running vmware fusion's 30-day trial for almost three weeks now and comparing it to parallels, which i bought over a year ago, when it had no competition. 
i must say i'm impressed. 
it's easier to use, and faster, and my non-standard (ergonomic) mouse just works! 
i don't know about vmware fusion's customer support, i've had no need for it. 
parallel's customer support, however, leaves something to be desired. 
i never did get an answer to my mouse questions (i could never get it to work, still can't) and it wasn't until i complained about an advertising e-mail they sent me that i heard from them at all, and then only to tell me to submit any &quot;request&quot; (meaning technical question) from their website. 
i had submitted all of them that way, except for the complaint, which i e-mailed... long story short: i'm really sorry i bought parallels (and now they want more money for the upgrade) and didn't know to hold out for vmware fusion. 
i would strongly suggest you try it first, before parallels. 
my macbook happily runs os x 10.4.10 and xp pro at the same time, but i hope list.cnet.remains 
s.cnet.train 
scripts will be even happier when leopard comes out and boot camp is on the desktop...
