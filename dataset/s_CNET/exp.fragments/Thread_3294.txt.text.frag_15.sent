i am going to put in order for ram at crucial tomorrow. 
even though they sayi can mix sizes i think i will get a set just in case. 
tomshardware was super interesting. 
i put the link in favs. 
thanks for helping me. 
i just want to make the right decision and not buy a card that is too strong for my small computer. 
if the card is better than i have i will be happy. 
have a good night.
