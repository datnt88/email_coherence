if the ups model is yrs. 
old, then think that any battery(s) replacement is going to cost and maybe better spend on a new ups. 
as batteries age and do get used, the uptime for safe shutdown is reduced plus any added devices attached, the time is further reduced. 
check with apc for the specs on that model and determine what the time frames for devices attached is the uptime given. 
weight these factors and go from there. 
better ups do provide basic surge protection, so if it got &quot;hit&quot; expect a lessen or defeated surge protection and a only a new ups will do after that.
