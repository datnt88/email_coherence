have you gone to and looked at their monitors?? your link said that they were out of stock. 
i also make certain that the one that i buy has a three year warranty. 
here's a link to four pages of monitors. 
. 
don't get confused when you note that the x inch wide screen monitors are lower priced than the regular x inch monitors. 
the wide screens have considerably less viewing area, thus the basic screens are lower price.
