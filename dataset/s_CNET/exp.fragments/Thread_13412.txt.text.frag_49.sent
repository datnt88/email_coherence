just discovered the peerblock firewall and it's free! 
very useful and flexible. 
i agree with the several ideas of doing a cost analysis for the pub in terms of return on the investment in an &quot;open broadband&quot; plan. 
it may still not be enough. 
this is where this firewall comes in. 
you have control over both ports and sites to be blocked out, no rocket science included. 
all you need do is get the browsing histories for the unwanted sites and block them. 
this may still be stick figure control, but it may help to get the wildest cards off the table.
