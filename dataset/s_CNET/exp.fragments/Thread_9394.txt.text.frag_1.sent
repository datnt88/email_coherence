i currently have 4 sata drives and 2 ide drives that i would like to attach to either my router or an extra pc via usb and run them as nas. 
i current have them spread out in two cases both running server 2003. 
reason i want to abandon the existing setup is a. i don't like running both servers all the time due to power consumption (want to be able to power on and off as i need them) b. one of the servers is beginning to show signs of main board failure. 
here are two products i found for the sata: or . 
both of these contain two sata drive enclosures so either will suit my needs. 
i cannot seem to find an external drive enclosure for 2 ide drives. 
i have found plenty of single drives such as the following: but i am not too keen on this one due to it only supports 1 drive and has no cooling fan. 
please let me know if anyone has had any success or failure with either of these or could recommend a different device. 
any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
