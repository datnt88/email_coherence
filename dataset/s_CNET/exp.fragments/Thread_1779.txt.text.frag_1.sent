i'm looking at around $1000. 
here is my friend's computer, which i was loosely basing mine from, and i quote from a text: nvidia gforce gtx 660 intel i5-3570k processor 8gb vengeance corsair ram toshiba 1gb hdd 550w power supply generic cd drive i was basing mine on his, which cost him around $800, but i'm seeing quite a few different things across the internet. 
i'd like to be able to run things like bioshock or elder scrolls on medium to high (at least better than an xbox), as well as the new final fantasy mmo and some video and such. 
i've tried to educate myself, but there are just so many different pieces... i would appreciate any help or advice, and i apologize for knowing so little.
