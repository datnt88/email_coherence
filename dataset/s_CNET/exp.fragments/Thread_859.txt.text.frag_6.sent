why replace the part that works? 
and yes, your post lacked details such as xp. the 4gb is interesting as i find some apps fail with over 1gb ram installed. 
another good reason to look at replacing apps. the hang you describe reminds me of codec troubles. 
if it is a codec the new software usually fails too. 
try this -&gt; dvd flick. 
i capture with what i have and create the dvd with that without much fuss.
