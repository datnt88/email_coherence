the drivers i will like to install are : intels quick resume thechnology and intel matrix storage technology more background info about why i want these drivers(viiv requirements): the thing is i do not know if the motherborad i want to get has what is required for these drivers. 
i would guess so because according to intel it is a property the p965 chipset. the motherboard i have found is: wots a mobo model? 
i dont mind sata but i suppose p atawill be faster since it is parallel data transmission am i right? 
thanks ray.
