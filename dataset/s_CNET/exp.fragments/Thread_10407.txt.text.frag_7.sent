... all knotted up into one big mess. 
i did a quick google... and clicked on this particular link first... it looks good. 
maybe it can help twenty steps to help diagnose and fix system issues while it's good that we know approximately where the problem is, unfortunately there's a lot of stuff in the user account to pick through. 
and now you will have to do some serious troubleshooting. 
oftentimes, this will be a preferences file in ~/library/preferences/. if you can pinpoint that one bad file, you're done. 
if you have no idea what's going on you can try the laborious process of keeping that new account you made, and bringing over the files one by one until you find the one that was the problem. 
even easier is to ask an expert if it's a frequently seen problem, first letting them know that it was a problem in your user account. 
course, this may not be what you want. 
good luck grim
