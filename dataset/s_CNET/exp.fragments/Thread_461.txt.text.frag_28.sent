i believe your c65 is similar to the cx5200 that i own. 
because of their fine resolution the tiny jets can get dry and clog up if you don't use the printer at least once a week. 
i've learned the hard way. 
epson says using alcohol or windex will cause damage. 
i was ready to pitch it, then i discovered they've got the cleaning goods for specific models of epson printers. 
i bought a small vial of cleaning solution (they claim it's what the epson factory uses) and a syringe for under $10 - fast shipping puts it at $15. the stuff really worked!! the vial was good for dozens of applications. 
give it a try.
