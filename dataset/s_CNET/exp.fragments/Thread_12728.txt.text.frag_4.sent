if you decide to build, buy the parts from newegg.com, which is the best place to buy computer parts. 
they have low prices and good customer service. 
you can even get an extended warranty from newegg when you purchase the item. 
otherwise, you get warranties from the makers of the parts. 
i agree with not buying refurb; i've had a bad experience.
