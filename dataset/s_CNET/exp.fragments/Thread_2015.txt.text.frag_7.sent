since stating a minimum psu never is a good spec i use a 20 buck watt meter. 
i put the machine up on the watt meter and look at the readings at idle on the windows screen then a few games. 
then i can figure out if we are in trouble. 
most psu's are about 80% efficient so we know the watts on the ac is that far off. 
to see if we are in trouble i use 50% of the psu's rating and don't want the watt meter to exceed that. 
this gives the psu some head room. 
one last check is the amperes on the psu rail check. 
you find the video card's amperes and make sure the psu rails can support that. 
here's the problem. 
most techs and owners don't want to do this work.
