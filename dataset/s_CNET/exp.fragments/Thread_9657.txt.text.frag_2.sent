i encountered the same problem and here is what i did to resolve it: select the files/folders you want to share on your network, right click the folder and select &quot;sharing and security.&quot; 
then click on the &quot;sharing&quot; tab and click the option for &quot;share this folder on the network.&quot; 
i also selected the option for &quot;allow network users to change my files&quot; only because i work between my notebook and desktop. 
once that's complete, click &quot;apply.&quot; 
if you've done this correctly, you will see a hand supporting the folder which indicates you've successfully shared the folder. 
repeat this process for both computers. 
best of luck!
