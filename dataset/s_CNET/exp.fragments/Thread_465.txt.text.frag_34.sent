my dell inspiron 8600 was shipped 11/10/03..using xp..mostly e-mail, photo, voip.......computer had a serious melt down while under an extended warranty and dell came to the house to repair it ........after 18 trips to italy, 3 to the dominican republic, plus thousand of hours of use at home i am starting to get worried.....and while this computer has served me extremely well i'm not sure which computer to purchase in the near future.......a new one is out there waiting for me ....just have to do the research.....
