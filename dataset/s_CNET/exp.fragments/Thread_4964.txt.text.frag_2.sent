connect the drive you want to erase only. 
boot from a floppy or cd with a utility to wipe it clean of all data and partitions. 
personally, i prefer the drive manufacturer's utility that does so as part of a destructive testing procedure. 
these also test the drive hardware and the integrity of the media. 
every manufacturer has their own name. 
seagate's is &quot;seatools&quot;. wd, hitachi and others offer such.
