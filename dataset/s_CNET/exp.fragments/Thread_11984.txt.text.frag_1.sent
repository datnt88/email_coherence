i have a canon pixma mp780 all in one, and the scanner is stuck at one end and will not move. 
when i try to scan or copy all i hear is loud clicking from the cables that move the scanner, and a message that says &quot;scanner error.&quot; the cable that is hooked to the scanner seems to be plugged in-i took off the right side of the printer where the motherboard is. 
i need this to fax and scan docs, so any help would be much appreciated.
