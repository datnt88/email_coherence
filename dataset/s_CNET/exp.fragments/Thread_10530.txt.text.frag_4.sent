i'm just using the cables that came with the mobo. 
i bought a bare drive, so it didn't come with any cables. 
both ends of the cables look identical. 
i don't see any clip/lock. 
but the cables do look kinda &quot;chintzy&quot;, so i think i agree with what the other poster said. 
about the ahci and whether i have hot-swapping enabled...i'll have to check that later. 
(i'm not at that pc right now.) i know that i did not press f6 at any time during boot-up, if that's what you first meant. 
it did ask me to if i wanted though. 
what exactly does ahci stand for, btw? 
and, i'm assuming that if i discover that hot swapping is enabled, then i should disable it...right? 
or does it matter? 
thanks.
