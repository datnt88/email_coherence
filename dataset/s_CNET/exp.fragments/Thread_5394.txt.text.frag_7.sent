this cost of this device, however, would fetch 5 of the 3com units. 
it doesn't list the poe standard either but i do think cisco makes their own power injectors for some models. 
no doubt it has features and management capabilities that wouldn't be used in this school....partially because no one there would know how. 
it's nice to think big but we need to live with reality. 
it's not a big school...k-8 with a capacity of about 250 kids plus the staff. 
i'm hoping to get by with 3 or 4 aps and a small capacity but rack mountable switch that can power them. 
i'm hoping to propose we can do the project for under $1500. 
i can get a spool of cat-5 donated so that will help.
