the type and duration of beeps on bootup vary with the type of bios you have. 
look in your motherboard manual, as they sometimes give you a translation of what the different type of beeps mean. 
or,take a look at this link, in the big yellow box in the middle, the links may help you. 
but you need to know what type of bios you have; you can normally see this on bootup when the screen is black, and the text is white. 
i've seen better charts for beeps, but this is the best one i could find right now. 
do check your motherboard's manual/website first. 
good luck.
