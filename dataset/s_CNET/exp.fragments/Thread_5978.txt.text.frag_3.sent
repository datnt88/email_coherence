as the other post says you haven't told us much, you say you get the error but dont say if your system crashes! 
anyway shdocvw.dll is a iexplorer file so it is likely you have spyware as (i assume) a program at startup is trying to load a web page. 
therefore run spyware programs and if that doesn't work stop items in the startup folder of msconfig from loading until you find the culprit.
