any current new ext. 
hd is going to fit the bill, find the size that suits you(maybe multiple ext. 
hds). 
you then need to be sure you have more than one back-up. 
while back-ups for the end user has become more easier and/or at ease to do, it still follows convention to plan for multiple copies and/or areas to save to. 
so, as stated by robert don't fall only the ext. 
hd only plan. 
be sure to copy super critical data to at least some discs(cd/dvd/bd) as yet another storage media.
