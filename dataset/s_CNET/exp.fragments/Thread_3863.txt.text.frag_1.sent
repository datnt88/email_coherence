hello, i have a netgear wpn824 router with two pcs hardwired and a laptop (all xp home) and pocket pc on wireless. 
i own a web design company, and i am online all day every day. 
all other websites that i have browsed work fine. 
(travel sites included) my problem is that i can get to the expedia.com 
website, but cannot actually perform a search for a flight or a hotel or anything. 
i could before i installed the router. 
this is frustrating, because i use expedia a lot, and i need to see the site. the site just hangs in my browser, or i get page cannot be displayed.... i called netgear customer support three times, and each time they had me reduce the mtu size on the router settings. 
i have done as they asked. 
the current setting for the mtu is 1250. 
i still cannot get expedia to work. 
does anyone know how i can adjust this to make it work? 
or if not, please do not recommend linksys, but what else? is there a brand that anyone would suggest i try? this is frustrating. 
thank you
