i don't know what &quot;tx rate&quot; is, so i have no idea if it is locked at 54 mbps. 
how/where do i check? 
tried just about every channel for the router; we are currently on &quot;4&quot; since it is the only channel that doesn't have anyone on it, but there are a few on 2 and a few on 5 and 6, so it's probably interacting... at least this is &quot;rare&quot; and not just us being stupid! 
thanks!
