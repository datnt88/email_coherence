a solution i have not seen in this long and interesting thread is to use microsoft live mesh. 
as long as your are running windows 7 this should work. 
there are differences in live mesh compared to dropbox. 
here are some of the things i like about live mesh: 1. live mesh does not store files on a cloud server, it just synchronizes files between computers. 
2. storage is limited only by the amount of hard drive space you have. 
3. you can specify which folder are &quot;watched&quot; and synchronized--you do not have to put files in specific locations on your hard drive (like in dropbox). 
4. with proper permission you can log into a remote computer (like remote desktop). 
5. you can choose to automatically or manually synchronize folders and files (i use automatically). 
6. you can control permissions to people you invite to share files and folders (read/write, etc.) but, there are also some issues. 
live mesh is more complicated than dropbox and i have seen some initial confusion synchronizing folders on different computers with different pathnames (it will work, but may be confusing). 
and, this is not a good solution for non-windows users. 
for me, this has been a set-it-and-forget it solution to keeping 500gb of data files synchronized between home and work. 
as an additional bonus, i back up all my music and photography files on an external hard drive i hang off a remote computer. 
you can learn more at best, alan
