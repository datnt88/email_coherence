i'm debating on whether to get a intel core 2 duo e6850 running at 3ghz or a intel core 2 quad q6600 running at 2.4ghz. 
the system will be used almost exclusively for gaming and i do not plan on overclocking. 
i can get them at the same price at newegg. 
also, i want to be as future-proof as possible. 
so for pure gaming, which is better? 
thanks, shlomo
