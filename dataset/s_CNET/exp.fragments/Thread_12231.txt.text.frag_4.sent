i'm a very solid hardware sort of person. 
i do embedded electronics and use pcs to do some test and control. 
i read your post and can't see any item to stick out like a sore thumb. 
but how about the usual? 
1. is the machine free from all parasites? 
2. can you detail what's in the machine? 
3. is the bios current?
