i have a smartdisk usb 2.0 bus powered portable 40 gb notebook hdd. 
although it has the smartdisk brand on it creative has exactly the same product as creative usb hdd. the problem is that, no matter which usb port i plug the device in, xp keeps saying that it's not plugged into a usb 2.0 port and the device works really slow (at usb 1.1 speed). 
i tried the device with a number of desktops and notbeooks, and with every usb port on these computers, but always got the same result. 
the device has a &quot;y&quot; shaped plug going into the computer, that is two usb plugs parallel. 
i think one of them is for draining power from another usb port if the main doesn't have enough power. 
that's what i experienced using the plugs in combinations. 
it works with the main one plugged in only . 
thanks
