i'd forgotten about the power needs of newer video cards. 
i had to replace a failing psu in an hp762c and it took a while to find one - but the new one had a lot more power then the original. 
and it had newer power connectors for things like sata. 
i finally found a decent video card (but not a gamers card)which i knew i had enoug power for, and i later added a wd caviar green hd (they use less power)
