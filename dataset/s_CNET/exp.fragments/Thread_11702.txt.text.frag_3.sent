sorry, bob, i should have put more information on it. 
os (win 98) was reinstalled after a full reformat of the hd. i can't remember now why she felt like she needed to do that. the dvd was a gateway installed ... the manufacturer started with an &quot;m&quot;, but i can't remember exactly who it was. 
i'll e-mail her and find out. 
thanks for your help.
