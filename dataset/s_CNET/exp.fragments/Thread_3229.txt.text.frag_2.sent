the version of motherboard driver package you used. 
also try setting the &quot;init display&quot; to pcie or others. 
sorry if that isn't the right words for your bios but there is no standard so i just look to see if it's an option. 
also, some of these boards need a power supply connection. 
i note this in case yours did and you forgot.
