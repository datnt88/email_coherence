if connections are proper, you should have nothing to lose. 
i cannot think of a reason xp would damage the drive but it's been known to alter the mbr. 
once you transfer what you wish, you can format it for whatever use you desire. 
when you put the drive in the enclosure, set the jumper to cs (cable select) as it will be a single drive. 
boot xp and then insert the usb plug. 
xp should first detect and configure the controller and then recognize the drive and give it a drive letter. 
it will then appear in &quot;my computer&quot;.
