and it works (well, i played a dvd rom game on it but haven't burned anything yet) great! it was perfect for my system. 
thank you all again. 
it was certainly a new experience replacing a cd player with a dvd burner. 
i'm learning all kinds of things these days. 
funny thing is, i was a little hesitant about buying an off-brand, but when i pulled the cd player out of my dell, it was a lite-on model as well!
