sorry for the late reply. 
your bios settings will dictate how little or high you can set the amount of memory to assign to on-board graphics. 
i don't suppose you will be able to set this to zero. 
if you were able to, you wouldn't be able to display anything unless of course you had an additional graphics card installed. 
some boards, in network systems for example, may have a default allocation of 1mb which you will not be able to change. 
ordinarily you can function reasonably well on as little as 1mb, albeit a little more might be better... 8mb for example. 
however, if you play computer games then you will perhaps have an idea from these, how much graphic memory is recommended. 
however much memory is assigned to the on-board graphics will be subtracted from the total ram installed, e.g. 512-32mb=480mb.
