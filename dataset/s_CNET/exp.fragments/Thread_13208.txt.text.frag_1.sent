i have a tw roadrunner cable internet connection and average about 5000 kbps speeds (when the computer is wired directly to the modem). 
i add a netgear wgt624 router to connect a ps3 & xbox and average about 2000 kbps at my computer. 
i took these speeds when the game systems were turned off. 
i do not use the wireless option on this router. 
this is more of a drop than expected. 
what type of ethernet cables should i use? 
will cat6 cables help? 
should i upgrade my router? 
thanks in advanced
