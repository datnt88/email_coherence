ok, i borrowed another windows xp, type in the expand command, so now my pc has the ntoskrnl.exe. 
now it said &quot;load needed dlls for kernel.&quot; 
i googled that and found this solution &quot;expand d:i386hal.dl_ 
c:windowssystem32&quot; i typed that in, it said the file is expanded but when i restarted the pc, it would still ask for the dll. 
what should i do?
