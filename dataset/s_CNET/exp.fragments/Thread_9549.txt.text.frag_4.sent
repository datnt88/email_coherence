that you become adept at routing tables. 
if you are not ready for that, then you'll have to use pricey soltuons, i.e. those that are made for &quot;ready to use&quot; applications.&quot; 
once you pick up a little routing and ip knowledge, write back and see if we can sort it out with your &quot;router&quot;.
