well graphics software like you have as well as video editting software are processor and memory intesive applications. 
you seem to have that coverd in spades!!! getting a good video card won't hurt. 
video games need a fast video card. 
so $150~200 for a good 256mb video card with 3d should take care of you. 
a good monitor and a montior calabrator would better than a highend video card.
