i replaced a lynksys router with belkin n+ router. 
i am having internet connection issues. 
i worked with belkin support. 
they updated the firmware, changed channel but the wireless internet speed is 20% of the cable modem speed. 
i have 2 laptops with windows xp. i also would like to connect my 1tb portable drive to the usb port. 
please suggest the settings for this router. 
i will be so greatful.
