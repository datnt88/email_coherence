the only thing about it is that it runs on vista (i'm staying away from vista for a while, until they make some major updates, at least). 
i'm not sure about if it will be compatible with your games. 
intel is going to drop the price of their core 2 duo e6750 processor to $180 next week, making it a better performing cpu in the same price range as the 6000+. 
here is a comparison of the two: but if that doesn't matter to you, that's a pretty good set up right there (for the price). 
just be wary of heat issues, it doesn't look like that desktop is set up to deal with a whole lot of it. 
if i were you though (and wasn't comfortable with assembling a pc myself), i would choose pretty much every component of my computer individually on sites like or . 
you would probably come out with a better pc than any stock one on the market for that price range, and it would most likely be more upgradeable than any stock pc as well. 
if you did want to do this, here's probably what you're looking for: the thing i don't like about ordering desktops is the lack of information about the pc's internals. 
when i'm buying something, especially when i'm paying that much, i like to know exactly what's in it.
