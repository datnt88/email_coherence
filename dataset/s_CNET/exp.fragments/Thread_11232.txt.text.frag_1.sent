hello. 
i am re building a old computer i found in my cuboard. the mistake i made is that i pulled out everything when i haden't decided to re build it. 
then i decided i would. the only problem i have now is that i don't know where all the power calbes go in the motherboard. 
does anyone know how many calbes go into the mother board, where or a website that can tell me. 
thank you in advance.
