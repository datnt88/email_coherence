john robie, i respect your posts here. 
you always prove to be well researched. 
however, i will never post a suggestion that goes against a manufacturers recommendations while it is still under warranty. 
the ati x700 is a very good card and for the marginal difference between it and the nvidia, why go against manufacturer recommendations? 
i own a recently purchased t6212, the same as mentioned in the &quot;disable onboard graphics&quot; question and have added 1 gig of corsair dual channel memory and an ati based abit rx600pro. 
i have not tried to o/clock and i have yet to find something the video can't do and my card is one step below the x700! 
i watch streaming video and do video editing and the x600pro is perfect. the x700 goes one better. 
keith.
