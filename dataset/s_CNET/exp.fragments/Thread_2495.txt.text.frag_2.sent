love to comment, but nothing about if this was an isa modem or if you loaded &quot;drivers&quot; for the modem. 
one thing that gets many is that the dial up connectoid (hint, use google.com for that word) may need to be deleted and recreated. 
but that's a software issue you can take up in the os forum. 
as to com 2, you'll want an isa card set to irq 3 and any other serial port at this address disabled. 
i don't suggest com3 or 4. bob
