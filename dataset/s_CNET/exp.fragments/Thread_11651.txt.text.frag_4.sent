i did not get an error number at all. 
i did try your suggestions but i don't seem to have some of the items that are mentioned. 
for instance it said to click on the device manager, but there was nothing listing a device manager. 
also i only had cd drive under properties, but it is a dvd i need to copy. 
i did try the cd drive but no recording drive came up.
