all that data you've just listed is pretty much worthless. 
you've displayed the temps of everything but your video card and the voltages arent labled so who knows what is taking up how much power. 
you said it yourself your card is atleast 3 years old so your power supply isnt the problem 485w is more then enough 3 years ago, you've updated every bios and video card driver and almost everyone who posted a reply narrowed the problem down to your video card and swapping out the video card. 
you've already came to a conclusion that it's not a software problem with all the updateing you've done. 
now start swapin to see if it's a hardware problem.
