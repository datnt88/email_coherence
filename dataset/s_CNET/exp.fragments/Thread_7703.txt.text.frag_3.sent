thanks, vapcmd for replying. 
i take it you mean to back up the data if i can recover it to another drive, in the event of a repeat crash in the future. 
if i can just manage to do a recovery, this drive will be getting trashed, as i have no wish to go through all this again, and neither does my daughter. 
i will certainly be re-emphasizing to her the need to do regular backups from now on. 
as to using a data recovery service, it really would be more expensive than we could afford, even though the data is important to her.
