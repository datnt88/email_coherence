hi everyone. 
i recently recieved a siemens se505 wireless router. the quick installation guide told me to first disallow windows from configuring the wireless network. 
once i had done that, i had to change the ssid of the adapter to connectionpoint. 
once i had done this, the computer could see the router, and i had excellent signal strength. 
i then had to enter the ip address of the router and this would allow me to configure the router. 
i configured it, was able to surf the net, and everything was fine. 
i then went again to the cofiguration page, and enabled wep encryption and mac control (if that is how one refers to that). 
then i logged out, and since then, i have never been able to connect to the router. 
i always have excellent signal strength, but i can never connect to the router or enter the cofiguration state. 
when i type in the routers address in firefox or explorer, i get the message saying the connection was refused. 
i tried both enabling and disabling wep on my adapter, but niether setting helps. 
i tried the factory reset on the router which should have reset all passwords and settings, but i still have no luck. 
i don't know if this is relevant, but when i directly enter my routers ip address and subnet mask rather than saying to look for the ip address automatically (as i am supposed to do), i am able to enter the configuartion pages. 
however, i cannot connect to the internet when i log on to the router this way. 
i have also tried updating the firware, and this also has not helped. 
i would greatly appreceate any help or info. 
thanks.
