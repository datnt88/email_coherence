hello, i just upgraded from a 3000+ to a 4000+ & it is a substantial improvement. 
it's like a new computer. 
not that it wasn't fast before, it's just noticeably faster now. 
i got the san diego core from newegg for 135. 
2.4ghz tooling along at 2.7ghz & it's not even breaking a sweat. 
i didn't opt for a dual-core. 
i just don't think there are enough applications out there to support it yet. 
i believe multicore is the way of the future, but the benefits don't justify the cost, at this time. 
your memory is fine, for now. 
take the extra money & put it towards a new video card. 
you can use a video card in your next pc. 
look into the 7600gt, 7900gt or a x1900xt. 
my pc games like never before. 
enjoy!
