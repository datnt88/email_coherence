good point. 
my guess is that the system is behaving as designed, but that the temperature is getting too high. 
in other words, inadequate heat dissipation. 
that's what i meant about the design flaw. 
i'll take a look at the bios and see if i can tweak the setting. 
also, i've heard there are utilities to see what the cpu temp is, but i've not tried one of those. 
also, it's annoying that the auto reboot uses an improper shutdown procedure and could cause system corruption. 
during a few reboots, i was not sure whether i'd ever ever get back into the system without using the recovery cd. 
fortunately i've been successful so far without having to do that. 
i'm not sure whether this is a vista issue or a pc issue, but since you mention the bios, maybe it's the pc. and...i forgot to mention previously that the power supply fan has also been making odd undulating whining sounds similar to those made by old pcs with worn out power supplies. 
so not sure whether power supply itself is shot.
