....this computer tries to come on the second you plug it in..the lights on the cdrom, cdrw and the floppy flash and then..it only goes to a black screen..the green power light stays on, but the light that shows the hard drive working doesn't come on......can't get into anything, anyway. 
have also tried to boot from restore discs....no good. 
i have a twin to this computer and i have switched some things trying to find the problem. 
1. the power supply 2. the video card 3. a different monitor 4. a different hard drive i have reseated all the connections. 
i have taken the mentioned parts and put them in the other computer and all of them seem to work fine. 
i do wonder about the power switch...i haven't traded that off with the other computer....should the faulty computer try to boot like this when it is first plugged in? the working one just sits there when you plug it in..waiting to be switched on. 
would it act like this if the switch were faulty....it seems to be getting power, it just won't boot up. 
does anyone have suggestions as to what might be wrong that i could check myself....i don't want to spend a bunch of money on this thing, would just like to get it running and sell it thanks lkm
