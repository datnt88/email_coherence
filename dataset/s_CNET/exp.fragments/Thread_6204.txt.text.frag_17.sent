godaddy's cloud storage is very economical, and they don't limit how many times you can access your account. 
you have the option of a public area where you can put files for others to access. the minimum storage is 100 gb, which is plenty for most. 
you can have your data files backed up on godaddy, or you can sync your files. 
but be sure to clean out the folders of junk that doesn't need to be backed up. 
please note, if you have lots of gb's to back up it takes a long time. 
you also have to remember, should you not have unlimited bandwidth usage, you are using bandwidth to back up to the cloud. 
i use godaddy for work, and haven't found the interaction to be very speedy. 
of course this may be because the files are still being backed up after about five days. 
keeping in mind the speed is dependent on many different factors, i.e. your computer is only as fast as its slowest component. 
for home back up i am using carbonite. 
it is very pricey, in comparison to godaddy, but it also seems to work better when accessing files. 
it too took a long time to upload the files off from my laptop. 
but the yearly cost is for unlimited back up from your computer hard drive. 
it doesn't do external hard drives. 
with your windows 7 account you could give your coworker remote access to your computer. 
there are many options .

good luck.
