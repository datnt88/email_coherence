yea, i agree that 2 gb is enough for most applications. 
even 1gb is enough for me. 
however, i am not going to question how much memory you need. 
i do alot of audio engineer/production work, and you can never have too much memory in this field, so i can understand someone thinking about the 4gb upgrade. 
in my experience with apple memory upgrades, i'd say do not buy the 4gb upgrade from apple. 
instead, i'd suggest just buying the base model which comes standard with 2gb (2 x 1gb). the obvious con with this option is, when its time to upgrade to 4gb, you can no longer use either of teh 1gb dimms. 
(probably part of apples clever pricing strategy to make us buy ram through them!) im not sure how much 2 x 2gb dimms will cost in the aftermarket, but with my experience it is almost always significantly cheaper than buying the upgrade from apple. 
also, if you are willing to do this, you can try selling the 2 x 1gb dimms that you are no longer using, on ebay or something. 
that will reduce your losses when its time to upgrade to the 4gb. 
i was planning on doing something similar to my imac, as i wanted to upgrade to 3gb. 
however, over the couple years that i've bought macs, i realize that the standard memory package is usually sufficient! 
so if you decide tobuy the 2gb system, you might find that sufficient before you decide to upgrade to 4gb! goodluck man!
