excluding the info already posted, why not just send a &quot;cd/dvd&quot; with the same info. 
a flash drive seems so over the hill. 
in fact the cd/dvd should provide the storage required for most tasks. 
as for .pdf, 
and/or other .pdf 
readers, etc., they should all follow the convention adobe as long established. 
but, i don't know why you decided on possible flash drives other than good promo, it may come to bite you as you repeat the need in the future?
