hello, i recently had my 3yo wd internal hd die on me and i replaced it with the wd3200aaks model. 
from the onset i noticed a slight slowdown in performance and a progressively louder noise coming from the hd. i've got a 3yo dell xps gen 5, os is winxp and 4gb ddr ram. 
i'm wondering if there's anything i can really do? it clearly is spinning loudly because the sound will increase as i add more workload to it. 
if i so much as look at graphic intensive stuff it'll start getting louder and louder and it's driving me insane.
