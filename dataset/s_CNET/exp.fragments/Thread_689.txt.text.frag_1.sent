our 8-year old hp all-in-one officejet g85 needs to be replaced. 
i wasn't impressed with the available models of hp's available, so have done some research in the last few days. 
i now have the choices down to 2-- the canon mp530 (about $150) or epson cx9400 (about $120). 
what is driving me nuts is that i've found a lot of reviews online about the canon (and they seem to be half good and half bad) but only a couple of reviews about the epson (mostly good). 
having purchased neither manufacturer in the past, i am at a loss. 
any suggestions out there? 
all said, in your opinion, who would be the best manufacturer in terms of customer service, product reliability, etc? i would appreciate any comments on this. 
thanks!
