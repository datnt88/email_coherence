try what is in the manual on page 73 or appendix h. 
if you do not have the manual, you can download it at: if none of that works, i would remove all hardware (including all pci cards), but the video card, memory, hard drive, keyboard, mouse, and 1 cd/dvd drive. 
not sure of the type of memory you have, but it must be dual channel type and installed in the correct slots. 
see page 2-3 in manual. 
also want does the led (u21) readout show? 
see appendix g in manual.
