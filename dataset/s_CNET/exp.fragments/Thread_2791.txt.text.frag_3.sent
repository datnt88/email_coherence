you can run a system file checker, even though you have an upgrade disk, it still has all the software required. 
start-&gt;run sfc /scannow press enter put your xp cd in if it asks. 
this will search your computer for files that are not approved versions and replace them with ones that are. 
once you restart, the problem (if it is a windows issue) should be fixed. 
although it seems as if you may be missing the system driver for your pcmcia bus. 
you can check that by putting a card that is not your wireless adapter in the slot and seeing if anyhting happens. 
if not then that is most likely the case and the above solution would be your best choice and the drivers are also located on your computer in a folder named dell.
