hey robert- interesting. 
i got an hp 1012. 
has 600 dpi with some sort of simulated 1200 which i do not understand. 
anyway, can you give some guidance about what paper to buy for printing sheet music that will look better than this not-so-hot copy paper i got at staples? 
hopefully not photo paper? 
thanks!
