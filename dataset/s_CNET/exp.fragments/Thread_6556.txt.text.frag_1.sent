i've just installed a new western digital internal sata harddrive on my dell e520,which is running xp. the problem is the computer doesn't seem to recognize it. 
when i right click on my computer, then click on manage, then click on disk management in the left hand pane, a listing of all my drives opens. 
my c and a partition, d are there as well as my external g, and my cd and dvd drives, e and f. i have two card readers listed as drives h and i. no where does the new internal show up. 
when i installed the new drive, i connected it to the spare power plug from the existing internal harddrive. 
i had to purchase a new sata cable which was plugged into the new harddrive on one end, and the socket on the motherboard on the other end. 
since it's a sata drive, i assumed the installation would be easy with no jumpers to contend with ; no decisions as to which would be the master and which would be the slave. 
i'm kinda at a loss. 
do any of you more gifted, brilliant folks out there have any ideas for me?
