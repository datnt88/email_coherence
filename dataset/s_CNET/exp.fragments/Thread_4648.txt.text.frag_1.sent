i have just ordered a macbook pro 17&quot; and notice that it has a firewire 800 connexion. 
i have a panasonic gs 400 camcorder and have been downloading by a firewire 400 . 
will the 800 give me (a) faster downloading? 
(b) better downloading results? 
{i know, of course that i will have to buy the appropriate cable. 
will it be &quot;worth it ?}
