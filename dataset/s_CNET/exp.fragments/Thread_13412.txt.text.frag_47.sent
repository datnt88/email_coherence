if you have a pc or laptop you can use that, as tim points out, to be used as your stand alone physical firewall that you can put astaro's home firewall on. 
the machine is used only for the firewall as the image takes up the whole hard drive, but you can configure it to do what tim mentioned, throttle bandwidth, and provide some monitoring of traffic, etc, and its free. 
hth, good luck andrew!
