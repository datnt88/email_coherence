well, if you need wireless connection (and you say you do) and you have windows 7 and you don't have a windows 7 driver for your current appliance, you'll need to buy a replacement that has. 
such can be a usb-antenna, or (preferred) an antenna that plugs into your rj-45 port or even on a pci-card. 
plug it in, install the drivers that come with the new device and you're ready to go. 
be sure to tell the shop that you need drivers for windows 7! kees
