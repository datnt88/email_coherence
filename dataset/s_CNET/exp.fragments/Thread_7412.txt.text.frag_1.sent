my daughter is moving into an apartment complex that is supplying wi-fi for the whole complex. 
she has a 3-4 year old dell desktop and has been using cable for her internet. 
what is the best way for her to connect to the wi-fi, usb adapter or a pci card also, would it pay her to purchase 802.11n draft or 802.11g.
