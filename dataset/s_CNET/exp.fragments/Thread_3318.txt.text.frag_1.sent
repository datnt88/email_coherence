dell inspiron 6000 laptop, windows xp home, been using a linksys wrt54gs router with speed booster for a little less than a year. 
also have a dell pc wired into the router. 
that connection is for the most part consistent, yet a power cycle must go down a few times a week. 
but the real issue is my laptop. 
i used to have a very consistent and fast connection throughout my home. 
most importantly, my bedroom which is a floor above the router. 
lately, all has become hell. 
i have a very inconsistent connection with my laptop. 
and now, i either get no connection in my bedroom, or an extremely weak signal. 
trying to upgrade the firmware (which has been a headache in itself). 
i've read a ton lately on how this specific model tends to be a terrible router. 
any suggestions? 
on the verge of picking up a dlink 655 extreme gigabit n router, even though my laptop runs on a g network. 
please help! 
i'm tired of not having consistent internet! 
especially in my bedroom!!!
