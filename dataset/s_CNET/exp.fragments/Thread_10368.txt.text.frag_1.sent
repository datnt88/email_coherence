with everything removed except working memory (various sizes and combinations tried in a similar machine), internal video, mouse and kb i am getting a blinking #1 light (no memory detected) and solid 3 & 4 lights (memory detected but a fault was encountered). 
anyone seen this or have a clue on what to do next?
