xp home on dell dimension. 
printer makes a loud sound like something-a gear tooth etc, is malfunctioning when it ejects a print. 
i read the posts on the noise the printer makes at the beginning but my noise occurs only at the end. 
prints seem to be fine but i stopped using it because i was fearful of damaging it. 
i examined the case and could not find any loose objects in the printer innards. 
any suggestions? 
thanks in advance and happy holidays.
