windows live search is only installed as an add-on to xp if you let automatic updates install it. 
i agree that it's a horrible update for xp and would add that it's a great example of why windows users should never let updates install automatically and always use the so-called &quot;advanced&quot; settings (a bit of a joke, imo) so that you'll know exactly what's included. 
i tried this out and uninstalled it within one day.
