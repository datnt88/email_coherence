my iomega (model gdhdu) external hard-drive has stopped working (i think it's approx. 
3 yrs old). 
i've tried a new power cable and it still doesn't work. 
is there anything else i can try? 
( i was considering opening the case and using compressed air to clear any dust) is there any way i can access any data stored on it?
