hi guys got an interesting problem here. 
this pc with xp home sp3 with these speakers that are 8yrs+ has basic audigy sound card and videologic zxr500 5:1 speakers /stats below output power: total 65w rms; fronts,rears and centre 8w rms; subwoofer 25w rms input sensitivity: 350 mv frequency response: amplifier 20 hz to 20khz subwoofer power output: 25w rms.......satellite speakers power output: 8w rms each sound is great...well at least it is really loud. 
my other pc also xp home sp3 has no sound card but is asus mobo p5b deluxe wi-fi with onboard sound via sound max new speakers are the highly rated logitech x-540 5:1...stats below technical specifications o total rms power: 70 watts rms satellites: 45 watts rms (2 x 7.4w front, 15.4w centre, 2 x 7.4w rear) subwoofer: 25 watts rms o total peak power: 140 watts o frequency response: 40 hz - 20 khz sound is poor better if use stereo rubbish in surround and volume is half that of the videologic sys. 
question: is it the speakers that are poor or do i need to get a sound card thanks reptile1
