i have an a7n8x-deluxe and an a7n8x-vm and both boards will try to boot up with out memory, but can't of course. the fans on the cpu spin, but i have to have memory for it to post and boot. 
if you have one strip of memory then that strip may have become unseated or the memory may have been blown. 
&quot;the fans try to kickstart&quot; i presume that you are talking about the power supply? 
if so then that indicates a bad power supply, or one that is being shorted to ground. 
in this case it could be the motherboard, possibly a capacitor shorted to ground. 
if you mean the cpu fan then the same thing. 
if the motherboard is only a few months old then i believe that they are warranted for one year by the manufacturer asus.
