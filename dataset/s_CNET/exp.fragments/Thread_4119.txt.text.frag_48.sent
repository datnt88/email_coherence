do not pull out your hair!!!! send the thing back. 
i have a new hp pavilion, i tried a new card too. the problem is you do not have enough power!! that's right, this %$*#* does not have enough power for a newer video card. 
hp say's it's got lots of power as it is but 300 watt's is the norm here. 
if you check your machine you will find the power supply is not high enough to push the card properly. 
most new cards need 150 to 200 watts power, that's on top of what your computer needs. 
anything less and it works until you push it then it craps out. 
yea my new computer does not come with enough power to blow it's nose. the booklet say's &quot;easy to upgrade&quot; it does not tell you that it only has enough power to work it's base line and the first upgrade you need is a new power supply. 
the video card is $100, the power supply is $150+s so return the card or buy a new power supply. 
that's about it. 
ps do not buy hp, you will be sorry.
