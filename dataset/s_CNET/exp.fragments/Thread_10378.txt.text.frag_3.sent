the external hard drive is an &quot;all or nothing backup&quot; procedure. 
so i need to delete the files i don't want before the &quot;all or nothing&quot; backup, then backup the laptop hard drive, then do my &quot;restore to original state procedure&quot;, then sync the external hard drive with the laptop and put all my &quot;keeper&quot; files back on the laptop hard drive? is that correct??
