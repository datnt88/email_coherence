fields charged me for data recovery but instead they overcharged me for &quot;disk head replacement&quot; and scratched my hard disk in the process, preventing even the manufacturers of the hard drive from performing a successful recovery. 
the report they sent me was a template which they send out to other people (proof available, just ask). 
have you seen this website for reporting scams? 
there are a lot of websites about this company, pity i didn't check them out first because they are an abomination. 
at a time when people's finances are hard pressed they are behaving like vultures, scum, sub-human scum. 
what makes it worse is that the authorities don't give a toss, how many 1000s of complaints must they see before they take action. 
i've never seen so many false claims made on one website. 
who the hell are fields group and who exactly controls this company, they are not based in pall mall thats for sure, but the very fact that they would try to use that place as a mailing address suggests that they are deliberately trying to mislead people. 
i found out about this company by reading the review threads, this website was pretty good too i wonder how many court cases they have going, please let me know how your's went, i am considering going through the small claims court to fight these fragments threads
