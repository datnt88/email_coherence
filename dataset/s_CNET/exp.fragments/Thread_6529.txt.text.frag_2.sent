tiffanie you can attach the drive from your computer as a secondary drive to your parents computer. 
does the ribbon cable that attaches the drive have a second connector? 
that is where you would attach it. 
you also have to attach the white connector with four wires like on the other drive, but you probably know that because you already attached it. 
that is the power cable. 
there may be a tiny connector with now wires near the power connector that allows you to set it to slave or master. 
you should set it to slave. the setting for this should be shown on the hard drive near the little connector (called a dip jumper). 
when you install it as the secondary drive you will be able to acces your files, but not the programs that you installed on your computer. 
you will be able to find mp3's, pictures, word documents, and other files in d:documents and settings(yourusername)my documents folder where d is the drive letter the computer assigns you. 
good luck and remember you can always do a search for the file you are looking for.
