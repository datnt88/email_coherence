those connectors are the type used by your cd/dvd drive. 
look at the photos of this power supply: antec basiq 500w power supply cables and connectors emachines usually have very small (low wattage) power supplies that aren't intended for decent video cards. 
that's why they don't have the 6pin pcie power connector those video cards require. 
i suggest you get a good 450-500w power supply for your pc. (such as the antec basiq).
