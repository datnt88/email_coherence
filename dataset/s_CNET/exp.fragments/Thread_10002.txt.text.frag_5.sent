no, sorry. 
i can't even see the screen , it flashes so fast. 
i found the cd that came with the monitor, put it in, and when the screen flashes i can see the menu from the cd but it turns dark too fast do read it. 
when it does flash on it's pretty bright so i don't think the bulb (is there one?) is going out. 
thanks for your help.
