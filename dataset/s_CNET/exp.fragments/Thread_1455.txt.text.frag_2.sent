sounds like u need a new computer dude...lol here wat u do, return the hard drive that u ****ed up on, get a new one, buy a new copy of winodws, dont borrow...xp home is pretty cheap bout 100 bucks? 
install new hard drive, install new windows and problem fixed! 
if u ask me u jumped to reinstalling windows after ur cousin broke it too fast...all this couldve been avoided if u didnt uninstall windows
