excuse me about my poor english (i'm italian ad use an automatic linguistic translator). 
i don't know whether to insert this question and i hope both the correct topic. 
i don't succeed in finding the solution for a problem that i probably think banal. 
meanwhile i attach you all the characteristics about my maxtor and my laptop.

scripts threads when the turned on laptop: i turn on the maxtor and the &quot;plug and play function&quot; recognizes the peripheral one and does to see it to me among the &quot;computer resources&quot;. 
if i detach the maxtor with the pc turned on (hardware removal secure or i close it), if i want to see it again in the computer resources, (my empirical solution) i must unplug the cable and to put it again. the &quot;plug and play fuction&quot; recognizes it, and see me again. 
perhaps, this is normal and/or regular. 
but if i do a xp reboot, the maxtor is not seen anymore. 
to see it again, i am forced to use the procedure above described: unplug/plug cable. 
for so much my question is this: how i can avoid this...? less unplug/plug the cable firewire 800....? because the management is very annoying. is this is a problem about maxtor ? 
or digicom sk ? is it resolvable ? is it a xp service that misses ? 
(or) a parameter (or) a flag that i must be lifted in xp...? thank.
