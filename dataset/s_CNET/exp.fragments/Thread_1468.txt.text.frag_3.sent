i see many folk wanting to replace their laptops with these and learning an expensive lesson in the process. 
if i were to gather up the current best tablets, i have a list but as it's personal, you pick the best for you. 
ipad, kindle fire hd, slate and the many other tablets means a lot of confusing choices for consumers.
