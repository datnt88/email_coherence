looking for some input. 
i have a desktop that is in need of an upgrade. 
it runs fine but slow even if i am just browsing files in documents or pictures. 
its an amd athlon (tm ) xp 1900+ 1.61 ghz., 256 gb of ram. 
what need to be upgraded? 
would i have to get a whole new motherboard or can i just upgrade the ram and possible the processor? 
my cousin built it and usually does upgrades but i am really into electronics and want to start learning on my own. 
thanks in advance.
