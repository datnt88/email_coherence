i keep looking at dell and alienware, and seeing how when you customize, the individual parts like video cards and memory to hard drives cost alot more at those places then on there own. 
i was wondering if it would be better to build my own pc, i know what components i want, the only question i have is, is it worth it to build it myself, because i've heard stories that home built systems have bad enviroments and poor stability. 
also, is it really cheaper to build it myself? 
now that thats out of the way, if i do build it myself, should i go pci express, or keep it old school, how hard/different is pci express?
