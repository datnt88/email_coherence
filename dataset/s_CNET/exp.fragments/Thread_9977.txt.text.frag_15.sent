to get maximum system performance. 
that's the design...dual channel. 
a single dimm or unmatched dimms suboptimizes system performance and frankly who wants that ? 
first choice is get an 8gb kit ...one with 2-4gb dimms or if you're cash strapped, 2-2gb dimms. 
re the psu....get the best one you can reasonably afford. the better ones usually cost a little more but use electricity more efficiently. 
besides, you can add components to a system if you have the headroom (extra watts and amps) and always transfer good components to another system at a later date.
