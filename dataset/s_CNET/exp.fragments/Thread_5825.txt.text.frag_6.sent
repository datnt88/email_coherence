$225...ugh ! 
believe this is the psu part number '146870914' if it were mine ....i'd double check the sony psu part number, take measurements, see if it wired generically and look for a generic replacement. 
$225 for a 400w psu is absurd and a sony gotcha ! 
if you can't find an economical replacement ...may be better to use the money toward a newer pc. vapcmd
