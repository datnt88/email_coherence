i have the problematic external drive plugged into one of two usb ports on the front of the computer, so i decided to plug it into a usb port in the back of the computer after what you said. 
it works great now! 
thanks you very much! 
i really appreciate the simple suggestion that nobody else has offered. 
i am currently backing up all the info onto another external drive that i have plugged into the second usb port on the front of the computer. 
i am happy that it works now and i was able to avoid having to pay for file recovery, but i am confused as to why one of the two front usb ports is running correctly, and the other isn't. 
shouldn't they be connected? 
any ideas?
