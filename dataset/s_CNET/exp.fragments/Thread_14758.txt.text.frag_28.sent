well, when all else fails, rtfd. 
(read the *&^%ing directions). 
of course, the manual (directions) don't ever state anything about recommended psu. 
but, i picked up the box the other day and noticed that ''recommended power supply is 300 watts.'' however, i think what was causing my issues was not the power supply, but; 1. a bad memory stick (i've swapped out and isolated - i hope - the one bad stick) 2. i think the fan on the graphics card is going bad. it now makes a grinding noise when i boot up. 
when i touch the card, the noise subsides for a bit. the noise lasts for about 20-25 seconds.
