if your description of the computer you expect to do this with is accurate, then it is woefully under powered for this type of work. 
even if you had pci slots, which i question as if you do, the software would not run on that old of a platform. 
same with usb. 
if you wish to do that kind of work, you need a machine with more under the hood. 
many newer computers will be set up to do that and have the necessary equipment built in, if you want to spend the money.
