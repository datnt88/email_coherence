i'm seeing a midi keyboard on a 15 pin connector. 
while pcs of yore did use this for a game port and creative labs put midi signals on said connections this is not a game port. 
there are no signals on this for the old pc analog game sticks. 
power to most midi keyboards are to a power connection and not one i've seen in 2 decades took power from the 15 pin midi port. 
notes the 1980 time frame, and how pc sound cards put the midi signal onto the game port on the sound cards of the day. 
it can be confusing at first.
