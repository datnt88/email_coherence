i forgot to mention that to replace that 25 pin boxed scsi drive you'll likely have to piecemeal a solution from a few makers. 
i'd look to granite for their adapters from 50 or 68 pin scsi drives i see for sale all over (newegg.com has those drives) to the 25 pin outlet. 
you'll either find a new drive housing or modify one to get over your last run. 
you can finish this but i doubt you will find nib ready to use 25 pin scsi drive in a box like we did 10 years ago. 
this is going to be not so much fun but is par for the course as old technology exits.
