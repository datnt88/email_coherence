hello, my question is about my dsl modem. 
prior to having it i had cable modem, it passed the internet ip through to my router and i was able to monitor all traffic from outside to my router to include port scans and hack attempts. 
with the dsl modem it's a little different; the modem gets the internet ip address and runs nat on the other side and issues a private ip to my router. 
thats where the problem comes in. 
even though the dsl modem has a web gui it does not monitor any outside traffic so it is impossible for me to tell if im being probed, flooded, scanned, ect.. does anyone have a solution to this problem or know of a way i can work around this? the model of the modem is prestige 645 by zyxel ds
