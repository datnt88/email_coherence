yes the card requires extra power but that is not a physical issue. 
the mobo is socket 939. 
i do not think it requires the 24v connection though. 
i will try and pick up an adapter just in case. 
i decided to rma the videocard. 
i will try and pick up a pci videocard to test to see if its the mobo before i actually send the pcie card back. 
if its actually the mobo then i'll just rma that.
