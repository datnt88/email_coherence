when i boot up my system lately, sometimes my bios post screen shows up and my bios settings have changed such as my voltage settings for my cpu speed and ram settings, my boot order, seek floppy disk, it loads my onboard audio which i have disabled because i have a sound card, i will go into my bios again and change it again sometimes it will boot into windows for a minute or two then try to reboot all over again and i will get no video at all and my monitor light will blink red and not beep and go to green. 
at first i thought it was the cmos battery even though my clock never lost time and i replaced the battery but thats not it. 
i believe that my motherboard has gone bad, but i need advice before i replace it, once i do get it to boot to windows it runs fine. 
here are my specs.
