what do you mean by microsoft site? 
do you mean asp pages and such? 
d-link...ok might give it a try. 
hope it has a better range than this netgear too. 
this one boasts 500 feet. 
baloney. 
not even 50. crap all the way around. 
but, i can see all of my websites, which my linksys would not, depending on the day of the week and the weather outside, and what i had for dinner last night. 
one step forward...two steps back. 
thanks for the input, both of you. 
i will just keep buying routers until i find one with no behavior issues. 
cheers!
