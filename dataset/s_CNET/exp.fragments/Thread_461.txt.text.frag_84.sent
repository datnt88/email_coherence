i opted in to the suit since my r200 has semi-frequent issues with &quot;false empty&quot; reporting; far from receiving a new printer or the equivalent in cartridges, my choices for compensation were either: 1) a 45$ credit to order cartridges from epson's e-store or a 25$ cheque and 20$ e-store credit, or b) a 25% discount off epson e-store purchases for a total discount of up to 100$. 
since i certainly didn't want the 400$ worth of epson stuff i would have had to order to take full advantage of the 100$/25% off deal, i chose the measly 45$ store credit - at least it gets me a few new cartridges for my ink-guzzling printer.
