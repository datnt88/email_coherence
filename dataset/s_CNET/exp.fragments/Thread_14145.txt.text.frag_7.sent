i am having similar trouble with computermemorystore.com. 
after a long interval the memory upgrade i ordered was shipped but it was the wrong chip. 
an e-mail reply said it was a shipping error but the correct memory had been set aside to send. 
i returned the incorrect chip, have not received the correct one, and have been unable to communicate with this co. by telephone, e-mail, or fax. 
a check of the telephone no. and address shows no business called computermemorystore.com at that location.
