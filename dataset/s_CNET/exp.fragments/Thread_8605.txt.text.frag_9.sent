yeah, i replaced it twice. 
over the time you've told me its a bum router. 
changing the password does nothing and resetting to factory defaults fixes it for a day. 
still. 
its nearly impossible for 3 routers of the same model to all be broken within the first week of buying them. 
i want somebody to tell me whats going on and please do not suggest that there are people cracking my network, because like i've said. 
i can rule it out because changing the password does nothing.
