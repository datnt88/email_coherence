2 gb would be at the extreme end and not necessary. 
i also like to get a lot of years out of my desktops by getting lots of memory. 
i have been using a desktop from 2004 until recently because i got it with, at the time, overkill ram and video. 
i also do game from time to time, especially the total war series with large unit numbers, which eats up memory.
