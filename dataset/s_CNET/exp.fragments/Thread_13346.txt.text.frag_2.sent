goto the device mgr. 
and check for red/yellow flags are present for sound. 
if none, then i suggest further to &quot;de-install&quot; the card, power-off, and remove the card. 
power-on and then allow system to finish booting and once done, shutdown. 
re-insatll the card(try another slot) and check connections, etc. and power-on once done. 
it should see new h/w and allow it to install itself or direct it to the drivers source(make dir/source of latest drivers). 
it should work or attempt at a better rate. 
if it doesn't work, either you have a stuffed h/w system or a s/w conflict. 
also, too many resources being used by the system, clean/reduce them or try that before any de-install steps above. 
you may want to check the system services and determine what you really need. 
check at for hints/tips on services. 
hope this helps... good luck -----willy
