i would investigate the bios settings. 
i have experienced spontaneous changes in bios settings on a few computers. 
most computers of recent vintage have temperature monitoring circuitry. 
the bios settings allow you to select a preselected temperature to execute an automatic shutdown. 
i would increase the temperature indicated to see if there is any change in the shutdown time. 
if the computer remains up longer i would suspect either a faulty sensor or faulty component. 
you can also disable the temperature sensing / shutdown option. 
good luck
