you can use disk managment to convert fat32 to ntfs, (it does not work in reverse!) apart from being more reliable, if my old memory serves me correctly, fat32 uses 32kb clusters and ntfs uses 4kb. 
what that means to you is, if you have a file in fat32 1kb in size it actually uses 32kb of hdd space, whereas an ntfs file of the same size would only use 4kb. 
if the above is not correct, no doubt bob or someone else will give the correct figures. 
in advance, i claim old age for my memory deficiancies.
