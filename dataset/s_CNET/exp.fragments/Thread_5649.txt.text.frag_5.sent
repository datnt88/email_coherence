i'm currently running a core 2 duo, and it's incredibly fast. 
i would say that a quad core isn't really necessary. 
i agree with the other people, perhaps a lot of money shouldn't be invested in the computer itself, but with other features like a nice monitor and speakers. 
for a monitor i would suggest a dell 24&quot; or potentially a 30&quot; if you are willing to spend the cash. 
a logitech 5.1 surround system like the 5450 would do you very well. 
a good sound card (x fi of some type) and a decent graphics card would serve you well, i don't know how many games you play. if you don't game much, i would suggest a 7600gt. 
i would also stay away from the core 2 exteme x6800, because for about the same price you can get the quad core core 2. for your needs though i think a core 2 duo e6700 would probably be best. 
for movies and entertainment a good sound card/monitors/speakers is always a good deal. 
also, a very nice new tv tuner came out - the vista view saber, which if you have an available pci-e x1 slot it is available (cnet review here: ). 
investing in windows vista home premium or ultimate when it comes out is highly recommended too. 
unless money really isn't an issue at all, i would go dual core. 
but if your heart is set on quad core, i would go with the intel qx6700, with the above components as well.
