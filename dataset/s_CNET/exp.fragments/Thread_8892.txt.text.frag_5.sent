where is the edit post button?? sorry, but i couldn't edit my post. 
i just checked the cnet site i gave you. 
they list some pricey parts, particulary the x800 xt. even though the card has dual monitor support, it is aimed at gaming and can be very pricey, 400+! also since dual monitor support is meant for multi-tasking, make sure you have ample cpu power. 
thanx ibrahim
