&quot;i made sure my cpu was locked in place 'cause my computer shuts off if it isn't. 
&quot; i'm betting you meant to write about the cpu's heat sink and fan unit. 
if that falls off and you just stick it back on then voids in the heat sink compound may form. 
fix? 
add a little more compound and hope that's it.
