i have xp pro, pent 4, 3.2 ghz, 1 gig ram. 
i just took the plunge and finally bought the maxtor one touch ii external hard drive for backup. 
it comes with dantz retrospect express hd. i have been wondering if i should use acronis instead. 
(i have not ordered acronis, just heard great things about it. 
i think it does more, but not sure what.) can anyone summarize the difference for me? 
thanks in advance.
