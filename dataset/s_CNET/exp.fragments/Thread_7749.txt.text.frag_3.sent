anything? any new hardware and/or driver changes, upgrades,etc. 
? 
try booting to safe mode... press f8 when its booting up... if you see the windows loading, you've gone too far. 
as soon as it starts up keep pressing f8. when you get the os menu, press safe mode. 
does it boot? 
if it does run some scans, like anti-virus and adware. 
then go to start, run, msconfig, go over to the startup tab and check out what programs are running. 
maybe a list? 
also, try running pc pitstop which will give a detailed analysis of whats running and if you can shut it down.
