i just downloaded a copy. the connections for the leds and power are shown clearly on page 15. typically the usb connections are as shown on page 16. each port is in the row ow pins on one side of the &quot;connector&quot;. 
they go vcc then some letter followed by a minus, then the same letter followed by a plus and then the gnd. 
what letters they use can vary, just be sure that the minus and the plus in the row use the same letter or letters. 
note that there are four pins in one row and five pins in the other. the fifth pin is for the ground for the overall shield of the cable. 
there are some instances where connecting this ground can cause things to not work. 
on my soyo mobo i had to cut that wire off the cable. the connections for the audio are shown clearly on page 16, they are the mic, the hpout minus r and r. r = right minus is the return nominus sign is the &quot;hot&quot; even though audio is ac thus no real hot lead, just a signal and its return. 
[takes two wires to tango in electricity]. 
it is not unusual for systems to use a common return for audio stereo lines.[often 
shown as ground] rather than a minus l [left] and a minus r [right]. the case mfr has no idea what mobo you will use thus it takes a little interpretation of the terminology that each uses.. i agree with robert with that title you have you asking such a simple question makes one wonder if i would use your company. 
seems best to leave it off.
