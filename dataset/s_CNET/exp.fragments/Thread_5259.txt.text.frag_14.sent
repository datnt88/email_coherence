ok, i re-imaged a new drive yesterday. 
i upsized my drive from a 250 to a 320. 
so far so good. 
this morning it booted in 65 seconds, a few seconds longer than before but i attribute this to a larger drive size. 
if it goes a week without a long boot i will consider it fixed. 
when all of this started i was having three major issues; 1. occassional blue screens of death. 
2. intermittent freeze ups requiring a power down, and 3. long bootup times. 
i suspected a virus but my av scan was clean. 
i bought a registry clean-up tool and cleaned up the registry (1490 errors in the registry). 
updated the device drivers, 5 were out of date including the display adapter. 
and replaced my c drive. the system seems to be very stable.....finally.
