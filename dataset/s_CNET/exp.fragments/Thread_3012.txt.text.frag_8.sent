you are only thinking of intel processors. 
ok, i myself have one. the great diference between intel processors i7 and the rest of the fleet is that i7 is the first intel processor which uses the new quick pass interconnect bus from intel and the nehalem architecture from intel. 
i translate: fsb is the name for front side bus, the bus through which the cpu communicates with the rest of the computer. 
till now, the great problem with the growth of intel processors had to do with the strangulation of data flow in the fsb. the growing flow of data of graphic cards and the growing flow of data from the memory controller were exceeding the capacity of the best fsb, limited by the clock frequency of parallel lines. 
with the new nehalem architecture, the communication between cpu and memory is now made by an independent and dedicated bus and the memory controller is now included in the cpu chip instead of the northbridge chip. 
this flow of data is now off from the fsb. the fsb is substituted by the quick pass interconnect, a serial communication done by 20 lines (16 data bits) which can guarantee something like 25 gb/s transfer rate in full duplex. 
this capacity exceeds largely the actual needs and is prepared for the newest usb 3.0, sata 6gb and ethernet 10gb and probably the expected pcie x32. the difference between series 8 and 9 of i7 is the double or triple channel in the communication with dram memory. 
as one of the other improvements of i7 series is the large amount of cache memory placed in the cpu chip (2x32kb of level 1 cache for each core, 256 kb of cache level 2 memory for each core and 8 mb of cache level 3 memory for all cores,) i shouldnt think twice between the two and three channels. 
the three channels allows you a larger block transference for each burst reading of dram and a cache line which can grow until 192 bytes, improving the cache hit and in consequence the work rate of cpu.
