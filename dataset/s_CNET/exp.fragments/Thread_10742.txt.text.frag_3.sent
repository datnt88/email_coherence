i can only get from certain vendors, ie only dell and j&r. 
i also want a server that comes with a program itself, in order to save on money and make it more efficient. 
a google search brings up a ton of small companies that make backup software, which is not what i need. 
i did a search on cnet, the linkstation pro and hp media vault are the two that seem to fit what i need, assuming that the linkstation's software can be used to backup more than one computer, which is what i'm trying to find out.
