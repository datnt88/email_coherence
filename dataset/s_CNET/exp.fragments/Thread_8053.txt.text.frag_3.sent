nvidia supposedly had a bad rash of bad video cards that was reported to have bad caps issue. 
i don't recall all the models but this was 1-2yrs. 
ago and users had several complaints filed, so google for such to narrow it down. 
i believe they were 8xxx series, which they fixed by the vendor/maker, thus brands like pny, xfx, and others got the fix/repair for nvidia chipsets. 
in many cases, a s/w fix was to slowdown the video port in order to help cool it. 
this is not the same issue of poorly manufactured caps, but the rather the chipsets. 
the side effect is blown caps which look just like &quot;bad caps&quot; once googled. 
be aware poor cooling can also result in blown caps, thus be sure whatever cooling is being offered actually does the job. 
video cards can get into stressed conditions all too fast.
