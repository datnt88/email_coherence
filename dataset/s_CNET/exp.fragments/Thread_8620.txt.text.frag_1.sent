i'm looking at the asus 1101 netbook. 
i really like the larger screen, 11.6&quot; compared to the 10&quot; screens on the other netbooks. 
the only issue is that the processor is 1.3 ghz while most of 10&quot; netbooks have a 1.6 ghz processor. 
i'm only using the netbook for internet and emails when i travel. 
any thoughts? is the processor too slow for what i want? 
also, the asus 1101 has windows xp. some of the 10&quot; netbooks have windows 7 starter. 
i am i better off with the newer os?
