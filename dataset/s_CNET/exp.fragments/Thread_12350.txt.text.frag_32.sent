not to reuse this expression, but it is true. 
staples and other brick and mortar stores tend to have maxtor over western digital or seagate... if at all for the latters. 
not saying maxtor is crap, but the fact that their warr is only 1 yr and that they're often sold in those venues at mass discounts (e.g. 200gb hd for only $50 after mir, altho it was the older ide interface) just shows that one would probably have to expect quality not up to par with other brands. 
granted online, better brands are cheaper, but then you're likely to find maxtor cheaper there. 
i had a roomate who bought a new maxtor hd. installed it, moved (not copied) many files from his old hd to that one. 
that new one died in 2 weeks. 
he got it replaced and it's been working for over a year just fine. 
it seemed like a freak bad luck incident, but i wouldn't be surprised to hear wd and sg to have that too, albeit less often
