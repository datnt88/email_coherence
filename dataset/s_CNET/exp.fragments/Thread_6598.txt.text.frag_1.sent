hey, i have bought used ati radeon x1900xt. 
it is in very good condition, it works but when i run gpu intensive tasks such as gaming, or gpu decoding, pc freezes. 
i thought that it was power problem, as this gpu needs 1x6 pin pci ex connector. 
i have a cooler master elite power 460w which has a one pci ex conn. 
and it works, but as soon as i run the gpu to full capacity, it will freeze. 
do you have a solution for this? 
cheers, fema.
