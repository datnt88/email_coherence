i got an old pentium 2 that still runs fine. 
now i'm giving it to a friend that's just starting and wants to use it just for some office-work and play some music on it. 
my problem now is, when i put a cd in either drive i can't hear any music. 
so i tried just about everything like changing cables, using just one drive etc. a dvd movie is just starting and playing fine but without any sound. 
so my last guess is, that the sound card is no good anymore. 
i can't check for new drivers cause i don't know the make and model of it. 
thanks for any help andreas
