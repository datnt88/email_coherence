generic ink which is much cheaper will not damage your printer as the inks are the same, but under a different name. 
the best way to save money is to buy your inks in larger amounts, as these can be brought from coles or woolworths, harvey norman ect, and fill your cartridge yourself. 
i have been using these inks for many years in my proffessional photo printer and have researched there origin and there is no difference between them. 
if you epson was damaged it was not caused by the ink.
