hello i am new to this networking thing. 
first i am on comcast and have my own modem a d-link dcm 200 this works fine for the one computer, but i need to net work the others i have, soon to be three. 
now i'll tell a small story. 
i am now on my third router with no luck yet, the first one was a wired router that would not work with my modem. 
i think it has to have something to do with comcast because it works on my friends dsl system, the second was a linksys wired with wireless it was returned after customer service could not figure out what was wrong. the latest one is also brand new and has been to the customer service phone lines. 
it is a d-link wbr-1310 i would like to set this up manually since the instant setup just can't configure it. 
has comcast put some sort of block on my modem that won't let it communicate with the router? 
they (comcast) want to sell me their home networking kit. 
i am running windows xp sp2. the router will communicate with my computer,the computer will communicate with the modem just not all three at the same time. 
everyone i have talked with so far has had me do the power cycle thing, check the cables, swap them out all of that stuff and are you sure you get the internet with your modem? 
duh?? well i know that their is someone out there that has had this problem and knows how to fix it, i hope
