os is not important. 
but genrally speaking does laser last longer than inkjet? 
and i like epson but not had good luck with any lately. 
somebody said the print heads on epson are not builtin to the cartridge like hp and some others. 
is that true? 
and if so does that make it clog or break faster. 
thanks, confusimo
