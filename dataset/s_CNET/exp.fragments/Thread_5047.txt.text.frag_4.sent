1. you may want to post the output from &quot;ipconfig/all&quot; on both computers, so we have more information to go on by. 2. do you have any other virtual or physical network cards installed on the problematic computer? 
(ie. 
vmware, vpn, etc.) 3. have you tried using dhcp as opposed to static mapping? 
in my mixed wireless/wired home network, i do utilize dhcp and static mapping with no issues, but i've seen some funny things happen when i tried static mapping with some home nat devices -- most likely because of misconfiguration. 
4. are you able to ping your nat/router from your problem pc? 5. how did you configure dns server entries on your computers? 
are you letting your nat/router be the gateway to your isp's dns servers? 
if you are not able to ping even the nat/router but you are able to get dns resolutions then --- errrrr --- i have to think about that... but that'll be a nice bit of info to know. 
i don't ever check these forums, the only reason why i came across this post, is because this post somehow showed up as &quot;news&quot; on my google desktop... so ehrm... good luck!
