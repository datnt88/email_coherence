thank you for your reply, just had a look at my current cpu and it just appears to be glued/soldered on.. mine does not have a cage/bracket around it ... so how do you remove it ?? any special tools or soldering required ? 
or is it just a case of prising it off and swapping with new one ?? thank you once again ta
