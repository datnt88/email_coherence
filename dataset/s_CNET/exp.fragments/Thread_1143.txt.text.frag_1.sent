hi guys i am hoping some of you knowledgeable people out there might be able to help me? 
(my networking knowledge is quite basic) i am building a new house, and am setting up a home network. 
i have got 15 cat6 runs through out the house ( 2 of them are for external for ip cameras) all my runs will terminate back to a patch panel in my study. 
i am looking for a 24 port switch to work with my set up. 
i will need poe for my 2 ip cameras. 
i am looking for a rack mount, unmanaged gigabit switch. 
i am hoping to spend &lt;$400. 
any suggestions on which switch to buy? 
i don't want to be playing with settings etc in the switch, i want it to be plug and play. 
my future plans are to connect a rack mount nas (something similar to synology rs 212) does anyone have any reviews/suggestions etc? i want everything to pretty much run itself in the background. 
thanks
