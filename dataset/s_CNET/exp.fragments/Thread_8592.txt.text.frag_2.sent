your router setup with wpa security, you have no worries. 
wep can be hacked and if you think using mac address will stop then, the answer is no. so follow the suggestions in the forum sticky . 
broadcast ssid use wpa security use nothing else. 
do not use mac addresses with wpa security, they conflict with each other. 
you don't have anything that trying to communicate with the wireless router, like a wireless printer or camera?
