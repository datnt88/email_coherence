i tried the suggestion of using another usb cable and ,lo & behold, after uninstalling and starting again the installation apparently worked. 
device manager said it was ok. as it did not show up in explorer i went to disk management which showed that the hd was there but with an unallocated 2044 gb - not a good sign! when i tried to initialize the hd i got the error message &quot;the request could not be performed because of an i/o device error.&quot; 
i have now decided that enough is enough in trying to recover what is an old, smallish drive. 
i may try some time in the future the suggestion of finding another pc to try it on, but the problem is now on the back burner. 
however, many thanks for all the comments. 
it's nice to find such a helpful forum.
