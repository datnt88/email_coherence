there are also cable spirals or looms which route wires through them. 
the spirals are easist as they wrap around like spiral notepads. 
further, there is &quot;shrink tubes/wrap&quot; when applied you then use a heat source(hair dryer&quot; and shrink the routed wires. 
of course route wires/harness as best as possible and keep from hard or rubbing points. 
while you can route some wires/harness behind the mtrbd. 
its best not to as possible prolonged contact could be unknown until too late, beware. 
anything else you create at will as you deem fit.
