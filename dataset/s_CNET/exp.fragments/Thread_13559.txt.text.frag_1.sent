im running an intel 2.8ghz processor, the board is intel d865gbf. 
when i start my computer, everything is normal but usually (and more oftenly now) the display suddenly turns something weird, a combination of lines and blocks and everything is stalled. 
this can happen before or after the loading of windows (no fixed time). 
and when i restart the pc, normality is restored for sometime but then again this problem can erupt any time. 
to give an idea of the sort of display problem ive taken a snapshot of the monitor screen, which can be found at note that im running win xp (sp2) and i hv two memory (ram) sticks for quite some time now i am not sure where the problem lies! 
but its really annoying...it could be the display, ram, or anything..itssurely not the monitor!
