just as the title says. 
here are my problems: 1) usb devices: my computer won't boot if there's a usb device plugged in. 
it just stays frozen at the post stage. 
i can't reboot with ctrl-alt-delete; i need to turn it off using the power button. 
also, if i plug a usb device (ipod nano) in after windoze loads, i get a message in the taskbar saying that &quot;this device can perform faster&quot; if i had a usb 2.0 port. 
this is strange because all my usb ports, on the back of my motherboard, and on the side of the case, are usb 2.0. 
2) hard drive: my sata150 hard drive is being recognized as an ata133 drive in the bios. 
also, in my taskbar i have the safely remove hardware icon. 
when i click on it, it gives me the option to safely remove the c drive. 
i don't know if this could be called a problem; it's just a little worrying to have the option to &quot;safely remove&quot; my hard drive. 
3) dvd: when i try to play a dvd using windows media player, i get a message saying, &quot;windows media player cannot play the dvd because a compatible dvd decoder is not installed on your computer.&quot; 
here are my system specs: dfi nf4-dagf motherboard athlon 64 3700+ socket 939 2*512mb generic ddr400 asus x600 western digital 250gb sata dvd drive dvd-r burner thermaltake tr2 430 watt power supply cooler master cavalier case windows xp home thanks in advance for any help that anyone can provide.
