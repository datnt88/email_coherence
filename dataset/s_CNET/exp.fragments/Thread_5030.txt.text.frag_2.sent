i got it to work after i read advice to go back a firmware version. 
i see new firmware but why did it take them months?

my neighbor had too many problems with the cisco models so by removing those names we are left with the belkin. 
even belkin has had issues in the past such as but that's a decade ago and they corrected this and learned their lesson from what i can tell.
