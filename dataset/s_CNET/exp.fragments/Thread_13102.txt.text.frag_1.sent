i am scoping out solutions for a new pc. 
i would like to build it myself, but am unsure of available components. 
here are my needs. 
i do use photoshop, and i am upgrading to cs. as far as gaming, i would like to run some first person shooters, but don't need top end performance. 
i don't play much. 
my wife would also like for me to make it into a personal video recorder. 
and budget is an issue. 
i already know: i want 1gb ram i have a case & power supply. 
i know what hd and optical drives to use. 
what i don't know: processor, is an amd 64 a good choice? 
do i need 64bit? 
what else do i need to know about cache etc... mobo. 
how much stuff do i need. 
onboard sound is fine for me. 
onboard lan is cool. 
do i need pcie or agp slots? 
and, most of all, graphics cards. 
do i need one for the tv functions and one for the photoshop/gaming? is there a all in one solution that is more viable? 
what chipsets/brands are good? 
and overall, remember this is on a budget. 
thanks in advance for the help
