my wife bought an ibook that she uses in her elder care business. the unit is used so going to a retailer is out of the question. 
i've decided to help her get connected at various hot spots and have been having difficulty with the airport subsystem. 
the ibook runs os x 10.2.8 (6r73), with 256 memory, and a processor speed of 700 mhz (powerpc g3). 
airport does not access a local hot spot that my desktop pc (gateway g6 450, running windows xp professional and using a linksys wireless-b pci adapter) easily does. the airport continues to show &quot;server not found&quot; message. 
how do i set up this airport user? 
thanks.
