currently i'm using a cable modem, a linksys befsr 41 router... if i want to add a wireless access point, should i get the one with a router capability or just the wireless access point i.e. linksys wap55ag or wrt55ag does befsr41 sufficient enough to act as a firewall ---for home user---? 
or should i install firewall software on every pc? thank you
