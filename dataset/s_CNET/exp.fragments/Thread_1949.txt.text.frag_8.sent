the issue there was the circuity that drove the electron deflection coils could overheat and fail if you were pushing them. 
this is not true for lcd displays. 
this post will be my last about this issue since there is not much of an issue to chew on here. 
its sad that someone has misled you a little here. 
you seem to be seeking some assurance i can't give you.
