but consider: best buy's goal is to sell you stuff, i personally would never trust anything they tell you ever, especially after reading about the geek squad &quot;scandal&quot; (more like acknowledgement of what we all knew was happening anyways). 
they'll tell you it'll work, sell you the hardware, and if the system comes back damaged, why does it hurt them? 
they get more reputation for helping you fix it, and more money from you buying parts. 
hp is the original manufacturer, and therefore should be considered the authority on the system, even if the csr isn't an electrical engineer, they've likely dealt with your particular model a thousand times over, and have the hp spec sheets telling them what it can and can't do, regardless of what some (can i say punk?) employee at best buy tells you. 
an online psu calculator can be very helpful, but consider that it only gives you an estimate of wattage draw, and doesn't take into account power supply efficiency. 
most modern high end psus are 450-550w, purely because thats where most enthusiast buyers are shopping (because they want to power high end parts like geforce 8800's and quad core processors). 
i would say either the 8500, or hp's suggestion of the 7600gs (newegg has a nice deal on a his radeon x1650pro which is $62 ar)) but to the power supply point, most 250-350w units are low quality, however there are a few decent quality units such as the antec smartpower 350w.
