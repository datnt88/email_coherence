my pc is suddenly not automatically playing cd's or dvd discs when i insert it in the drive. 
it use to come up (autoplay) whenever i inserted a disc. the only way it will autoplay now is if i boot up the pc with a disc already in the dvd drive. 
i have already tried to update the driver in windows xp (home edition) and i even checked the registry to see if the drive is set to autoplay. the drive itself is a pioneer dvd 16x slot drive. 
my dvd drive is set to secondary slave, and i have a cd burner (tdk 40x) is set to secondary master. 
if i am forgetting any information, just let me know, and i will post it. 
thanks for any info you can provide.
