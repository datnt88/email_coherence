you could find out who makes your new computers hard drive...and go to their site and d/l their hard disk upgrade software. 
you still have to go through connecting it to your new machine but most of the software now will make a flawless copy to your new drive and if you like you can leave your old drive &lt;info intact&gt; in a box incase you have the problem again. 
sounds like a lot of work but fast is not always best...applies to life too...lol
