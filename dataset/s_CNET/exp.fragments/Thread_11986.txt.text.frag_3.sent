hi bob, your second idea was the solution!! i can't believe this but his setting was 'never'!! i have no idea why it was set up that way. 
no wonder it was never refreshing! 
any setting on his computer is inherited from the family member who gave it to him, but i don't know why anyone would not want a homepage (or any other webpage) to refresh each time. 
such a simple solution but i hadn't thought of it myself, so thank you very much!! helen
