vista gpu: you'll need direct x9.0 h/w support in the gpu. 
on the ati side, the radeon x800/x1800/x1900 series with at least 128mb of ram will be sufficient. 
256mb will be better. 
i would avoid radeon x1300s. 
for nvidia, geforce 6000/7000 series with 128mb of ram is needed. 
i would avoid the 6200s and 7300s. 
pata drives: your pata 'ports' on the mobo each support two drives with the proper cable, so 2 pata channels support 4 drives. 
retail drives usually come with the proper cables. 
put the hd on the primary (typically ide 0) port, and the dvds can share the secondary port.
