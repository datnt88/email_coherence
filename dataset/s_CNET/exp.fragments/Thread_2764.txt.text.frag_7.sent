including all bob offered, and what you've discovered on the hd causing problems. 
i suggest you find an adapter or ext. 
hd that accepts ide connection to attach to the usb port. 
that way, you can access you data and retrieve it. 
there really isn't any repair here for the hd, the electronics are hosed and its better simple to swap out. 
since, its an 80gb'er it just shown its age and if you like to play with it, but once your data is retrieved, pitch it. 
of course, i hope the adapter or ext. 
usb case will work with that hd. also, mark it as to its problem if you keep it.
