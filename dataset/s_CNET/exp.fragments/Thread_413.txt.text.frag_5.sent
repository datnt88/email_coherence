i found a post over there that referred me to netgear, but it's not compatible. 
i've sent netgear a request for a tech note to see if i can configure with a pc and run on a mac. 
i can't think of a good reason why the os would be a problem for an ethernet converter, but it's probably more than that. 
thanks. 
best, - bill
