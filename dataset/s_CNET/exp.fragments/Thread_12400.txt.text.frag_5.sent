the minimum power requirement is a 500w psu, even though yours is 550w, that's real close. 
also, understand that the start-up power requirements of your pc maybe at a level or stripping a &quot;power leg&quot; to the max. 
of its specs. the fact it finally boots is a clue to this action. 
it will only get worse as time goes by. the 1mo. 
going by is another clue as time has been reached where troubles are popping up. 
get another better and higher wattage psu as you can afford, but don't buy the cheapest. 
thus, i agree wuth robert on this one. 
specs: tada -----willy
