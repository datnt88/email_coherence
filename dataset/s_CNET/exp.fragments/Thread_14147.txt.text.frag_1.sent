i forgot my vista password on my dell so i am trying to run system restore so i can just restore the settings. 
but everytime i try and do so the keyboard freezes up and i can't choose any of the options. 
i was told to try a ps keyboard instead of a usb port keyboard but there isnt an outlet in the back for this type of keyboard. 
so i tryed a converter but that isn't working either. 
the computer is a dell dimension e521. 
please help ..
