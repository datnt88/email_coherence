i have an antec modular neo power 480 watt psu going into a new build. 
so, i am not really concerned. 
right now i'm using an antec 430 watt psu and it's an older modol. 
never shows the slightest problem running video editing, encoding, games, photoshop, etc. so the 480 will run even better. 
antecs are extremely efficient and i always use them. 
of course anyone could go out and buy a 1,000 watt piece of cr@p and have it die in a week. 
i'm not debating with anybody, just trying to keep others informed. 
whether you like him or not george ou knows his tech.
