thanks for the idea. 
i ensured that the controls aren't locked. 
still can't find how to raise the brightness. 
when you pull up the osd menu, there is a down arrow and a right arrow in the menu display. 
it's beyond counter-intuitive that samsung would say &quot;you can adjust the brightness&quot; and then not have an &quot;up&quot; button, or a button that can function as one.
