you need to get permission from the network administrator to ''plug in'' a wireless access point (wap). 
once you have a wap (with the security settings your network administrator recommends), any computer that is to make a wireless connection to the wap will need a wireless network adapter. 
the wireless network adapter needs to be compatible with the wap's broadcast standard (wireless-g, wireless-b, wireless-a). 
cheapest waps are often wireless routers that can be configured to function as a wap.
