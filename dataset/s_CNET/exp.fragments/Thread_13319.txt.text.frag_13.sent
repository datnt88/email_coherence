when comparing notes with parents that sent their kid to school with a pricey mac laptop, the kids whined in 1 year for another windows laptop. 
not all but too many. 
since it appears that vista in beta form does boot and run, the intel mac may save me from such a fate. 
if it was not for this, we would not get the mac.
