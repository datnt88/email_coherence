now that you mention it, i'm having the same problem. 
i'm a new pc to mac convert. 
i have a powerbookg4. 
i'm also using a linksys wireless router. 
it only runs my home network. 
my download and general usage speeds are horrendously low on the mac. the pc laptop is much better. 
any suggestions? 
do i need to get one of those airport express or airport extreme routers and scrap linksys?
