i do not know what kind of graphic work you do, but mac not pc is the industry standard for graphics, video, photography etc.. yes, pc's do have better usage in general and you can use pc's to view all videos on line, but there are work arounds i sure. 
dell makes a great pc, but even dell has said that they would love to produce a mac clone. 
something to think about.
