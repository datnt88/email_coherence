i have recently purchased a samsung bd-5300 smart blu ray, plugged in the ethernet cable, all was fine, i am able to download apps, watch youtube, bbc iplayer etc, but a box keeps appearing saying smarthub needs to be updated i click ok, then another box appears telling me no connection and to check network settings ? 
network must be fine if i am able to download apps and watch online ?
