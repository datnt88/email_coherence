i can do some basic coding like java and know a decent amount about the system, but i have no idea how the actual hardware corresponds with each other. 
so far the specs on the laptop i'm looking at is 3rd generation intel i7-3610qm (2.3 ghz 6mb l3 cache), windows 7 home premium, 8 gb ddr3 (2 dimm), and nvidia geforce gt 650m with 1gb gddr5 memory. 
any opinions?
