my system is no punk but could use a good boost for gaming. 
o.k. so, my specs are as follows: amd64 3000+ (venice no oc) 2 gb geil dual channel pc3200 asrock 939-dual (pci and agp) 256mb ati aiw x800 agp 2 x 160 gb seagate drives lite-on dual layer dvd-rw lite-on dvd-rom blah, blah, blah so what i am wondering is, say im limited to about a 500.00 upgrade which way should i go? 
i mean i love my all-in-wonder but should i go with a newer gaming card and run both (agp and pci) or do i really need more ram (4gb seems excessive). 
or the motherboard does support the dual core cpus. 
any input is appreciated. 
thanks
