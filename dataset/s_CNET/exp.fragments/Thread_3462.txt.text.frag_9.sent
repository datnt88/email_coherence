i open a window &quot;network and dial-up connections&quot; there is a message &quot;to create a new connection, click &quot;new connection&quot; but when you try for a new connection you get a choice of two dial-up alternatives a direct cable link to anothr computer,an accept incoming connections, and a connect to private network through the internet. 
my adapter is blinking away so it wants to do something and is probably disgusted that i can't oblige.
