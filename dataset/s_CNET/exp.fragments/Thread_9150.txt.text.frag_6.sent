the intel graphics media accelerator 950 is just a little graphics card that is good for surfing the web, and playing some low-graphic games and stuff like that. the nvidia geforce 7500le is a seperate processor for processing graphics, and is for the serious gamer. 
they downgraded the graphics card from the nvidia to the intel. 
i'm guessing they wanted to save money.
