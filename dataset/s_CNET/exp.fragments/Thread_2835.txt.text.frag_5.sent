thank you for the helpful links. 
it seems that all of my drivers were current except for the via agp driver. 
i had v4.60a now i have 4.80a... i went through the entire hyperion 4-in-1 installation anyway. 
was this the culprit? 
nonetheless, i tested by playing several files (.avi .mp3 
.mpg2 
.ogm 
& .wmv) the system remained stable through each! 
hopefully it will remain so... thank you!
