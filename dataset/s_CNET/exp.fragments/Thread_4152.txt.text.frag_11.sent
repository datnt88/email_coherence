i found a site that has some great prices and inventory. 
they sell lenovo, ibm, dell, hp and macs. 
you can visit the site and compare configs and pricing. 
i do not think they have the new i core processors in inventory yet but computers at half the cost of new ones. 
they are used off-lease machines from ibm. 
good company with good reputation. 
i bought one from there about 6 months ago and love it. 
you can get extended warranties which helps when buying a used computer. 
if interested let me know and i will give you the discount codes i used to get better pricing.
