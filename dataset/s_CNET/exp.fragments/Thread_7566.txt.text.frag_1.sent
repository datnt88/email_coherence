hi ppl well i recently rebuilt a pc and now my onboard sound seems to be buggered. 
in the control panel it says the sound has a problem. 
its definately not a software problem as it happened with the previous hdd as well which worked fine b4. does this mean the sound is probably just broken and a new sound card is needed? the system--- antec slk2600 350w asus a7v8x-x athlon xp2800+ 'barton' 512mb twinmos pc2700 ddr ati radeon 9800se @ stock maxtor 80gb 7,200rpm 8mb eide dvd-rom/cdrw winxp pro sp2 cheers chris
