there are some fw boards, as you mentioned, that enable the fw bus to recognize a larger drive. 
with the earlier oxford chips, the 128gb limit is in effect, as you surmised. 
internally, the limit is imposed because of the limitation of the mac itself. 
the logical block addressing (lba) does not allow drives larger than 128gb. 
sorry for any confusion.
