i have a linksys wrt54g running as an access point in mixed mode. 
one machine on my network is approximately 40-45 feet away from it and behind 2 walls, and running 802.11b. 
it seems that the machine in question can only see and connect to the network intermittently. 
at first i thought it was a low signal strength issue but the level of reliability seems to vary, and when it does connect it appears to have a decent signal. 
there is a moderately high amount of traffic here, we can usually see at least 5-6 networks. 
i've tried several frequencies to no noticible difference. 
any ideas what may be the issue? 
bad router? 
bad card? 
just need more signal? 
thanks
