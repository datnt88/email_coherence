stan the man, i'm actually at the same cross roads. 
my machine is old and very slow compared to todays standards but it treats me good. 
i update and upgrade some components but somtimes feel as though i'm spinning my wheels. 
think of the future whats gonna come out next? 
your gonna want to build an expandable computer. 
1). 
get a quality case w/500watt power supply 2). 
asus p4c800 motherboard or the comparable intel board both have the i875p chipset. 
3).cpu whatever you prefer this board can handle over 3ghz. 
i'd stay w/ hyperthreading technology. 
4). 
quality hard drive (seagate, western digital) 7200 rpm, capacity is your preference. 
i've priced out a dream system for close to $1000 but you can build a very good system thats fully expandable from $600-$800. the best part about doing it yourself is its your creation. 
asus provides good support if you have problems but these forums are the best way to solve issues you may encounter. 
do your homework and enjoy.
