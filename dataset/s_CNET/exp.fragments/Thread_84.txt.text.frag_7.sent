after i make new partition what do i do, i trie to format from dos but couldnt so i used win 98 cd because i do not have enough memory to run win 2000 and the hard drive still only came up showing 7.82 gig's. 
btw the option i was to choose when it was time to make new partition was make primary dos partition correct?
