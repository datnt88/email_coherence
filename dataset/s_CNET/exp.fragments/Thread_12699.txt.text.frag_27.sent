at the risk of taking over this forum, i'll let you know what i did next and what's happened .... decided to zero all data on 40gb hd, full re-install of 10.3 (3 disks), choosing option for os 9 drivers [os 9 not reinstalled on hd, therefore no classic]. 
updated to 10.3.9 via apple..... preview doesn't read toast lite cd's pdf manual - broken text has many diagonal/jagged lines running through it, some pages empty. 
locks up when i try to open other pages of toast manual. 
no change if i drag copy of toast to hd. have to force quit toast/finder. 
toast icon won't launch from its window but disk shows on desktop/disk utility (using the lacie). 
disk util - 1 toast volume failed verification - &quot;invalid key length&quot; (?? ref to the roxio key code ???) &quot;needs to be repaired&quot;. 
x-tools cd - developer pkg launches then crashes immediately, whereas it opened before 10.3 re-install, installing all but two packages. 
pdf's (in preview) are empty except for a couple of lines of text. 
useless. 
patchburn downloaded but doesn't support my lacie/liteon cdrw. 
i consider buying the lacie a really bad mistake, getting toast too.... roxio support gives no clues but i've been told that toast 7 works with 10.3, whereas 6 apparently doesn't. 
before i did the zero data, toast cd launched on a friends emac 10.3. 
i don't have any other 10.3 compatible cd's to open in preview in order to check if there's a fault there. 
disk util finds no problems with hd. any suggestions as to what's happening/what to do next would be greatly appreciated !
