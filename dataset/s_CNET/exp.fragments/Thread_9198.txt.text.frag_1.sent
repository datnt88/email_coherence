hello, i would like set up a wireless connection with a friend of mine who lives about 20km away. 
i would like to know which antenna's i should get and how to set them up. 
there is a clear line of sight from my house to his. the connection will be for file transfer and gaming, so it needs to be quite fast. 
any advice would be appreciated
