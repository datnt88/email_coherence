there is a difference between cards that are &quot;built by ati&quot; and cards that are &quot;powered by ati&quot;. 
in many instances, cards that are &quot;powered by&quot; often contain &quot;enhancements&quot; that are specifically engineered for their brand of card. 
pipelines and/or shaders my be disabled or there may be overclocked functions that the manufacturer has determined are &quot;optimal&quot; for their version of the card. 
in my experience, it has always been best to download the drivers from the card manufacturers website, although i have had mixed success with using the drivers offered from the ati website. 
nvidia on the other hand has no such issues. 
after being a longtime ati user i now have a new pc with an 8800gts and will probably never go back to ati powered cards. 
also, ccc (catalyst control center) tends to be a resource hog and takes longer to load than nvidia's control panel.
