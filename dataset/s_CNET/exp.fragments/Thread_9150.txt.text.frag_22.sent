first, yes, it does keep the price down, it provides a 2d subsystem and low power 3d subsystem without needing a dedicated card, which allows for less overall components, meaning less power is needed, meaning less is spent on the overall system. the other advantage is that it keeps power use down, keeps heat output down, if you aren't going to be doing anything beyond the capability of the gma 950, theres no point in having something beyond the gma 950 as it will just increase the thermal footprint, and therefore electrical footprint, of the system. 
integrated graphics are a convience for system builders and it personel alike, as it keeps the majority of the system on one board (yes, if that one board is damaged the whole system is gone, but we're going to assume its built to a good quality standard (which most mainboards are)) this means the whole system can be built faster, more easily, maintained more easily (you have one driver package from intel which gives you sound, video, and chipset drivers for i/o, networking, etc, instead of 3-4 driver packages for the same thing). 
the only real downside to integrated graphics is the 3d performance, a few years ago (and even to a degree today) nvidia was toying with putting more &quot;complete&quot; gpus on mainboards, such as the geforce mx 440, geforce 6100, etc, the gma 950 is generally faster than the mx 440, and generally competitive with the 6100. the 3d performance issue is a major thing for gamers, but for most other users theres no need to pay for anything beyond integrated graphics, if thats all they're going to really need.
