i have a year old dell xps 420. 
after having some problems with vista i put xp on it and its much better. 
im having some vid card problems but i got a 4 year warranty from dell so im all covered on that dell xps420 win xp sp2 22&quot; widescreen dell lcd q6600 2.4ghz quadcore 8800gt 512mb gpu 500gb 7200rps seagate integrated audio 3gb ram 800mhz 16x dvd+- r/w 2 year old laptop: dell inspiron 1501 15/4&quot; lcd amd tk-53 1.7?
