anyone have any suggestions for third party web sites offering tech support on adobe (fka macromedia) flash player? 
adobe/macromedia support is non-existant and flash player no longer works on my pc. all i have are blacked out boxes where flash content should be playing and internet explorer's manage add-ons indicates the flash player active-x control is enabled. 
i have recently gotten rid of norton systemworks and a combo pop-up/ad blocker software and have searched and removed possible kill-bit entries in the registry, all to no avail. 
any suggestions appreciated.
