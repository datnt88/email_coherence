i changed the default account name a few posts ago, the one dated 2/24/13 3:44 pm (sic). 
no it didn't make any difference. 
neverthless, i have renamed it again to user, as it was before, and created another one with the same name as the account on the this, upstairs, computer. 
that has made no difference either. 
i can still see the shared folders ok, but when i tried to print from downstairs i had to add the printer again. 
it still doesn't print though. 
i get the printer's progress bar filling quickly but no printing.
