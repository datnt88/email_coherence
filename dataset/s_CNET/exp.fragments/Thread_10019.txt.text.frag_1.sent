using 3 hp computers - one desktop pc and two laptops. 
trying to share one printer, an hp psc 1350v all in one. 
using a netgear ps121 mini-print server and all the computers are also hooked into a netgear fvs318 vpn. 
all the computers can send things to the printer with no problem, but need to have bi-directional capability for scans. 
any suggestions?
