thank you bill for the fast rsponse.. i used &quot;iperf&quot; and as u said it works very well, but the problem with this tool is that it doesn't give u a real time calcualtion. 
i want u to know that i have full control for both ends. 
knowing this, will wireshark be able to provide me with a real time throughput calculation? 
thank u again 4 your help..
