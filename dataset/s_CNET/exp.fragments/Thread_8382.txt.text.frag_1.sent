i have a dvd drive that is now only recognised as a cd-rom when i select &quot;my computer&quot; in windows xp.it is recognised by neros disc info tool as a dvd - it says it can play dvd- etc and if i uninstall then reinstall i get a message saying dvd-rom found.so 
why isnt it recognised as a dvd, it will play cds no problem.i have reset the cmos , uninstalled then reinstalled the secondary ide in device manager but to no avail,any advice how i can get this drive to play dvds again?
