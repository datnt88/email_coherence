you can set the drive for either 'hot swapping' so that you can unplug and plug in without having to go through the removing hardware option, but this slows the drive as no data is cached. 
or, you can set the drive for optimum performance. 
i have done this as i never plan on removing the drive except in exceptional circs. 
hope this helps.
