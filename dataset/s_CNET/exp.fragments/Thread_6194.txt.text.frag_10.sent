i will post up links to a bunch of screenshots of settings once i can get them uploaded somewhere. 
i figure that will be easier for both of us... btw, i went back to the page for that patch and it said it was for xp only. 
should i put it on the vista machine anyway? 
and yes, you are right about the firmware, that is the version i'm running. 
also, there are no p2p programs in use atm on either machine, but there has been some use in the past on the xp machine. 
would it still be a problem?
