i have a netgear wpn824 wireless router and three laptops. 
the newest laptop is about 2 years old. 
i know that the recommendation when enabling wireless network security is to not use wep because it is too easily broken. 
assuming that i am using a router that supports higher protocols, how can i tell if my wireless devices support the higher protocols as well? 
if not, is it just a matter of upgrading firmware or would i have to replace the device?
