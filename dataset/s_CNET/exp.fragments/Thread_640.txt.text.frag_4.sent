i was actually at best buy the other day and asked why the 840gm was $200 more and the salesman told me because of the slightly newer/faster processor and because it had the tv tuner card where the 835gm did not (he even turned the thing around and checked). 
i thought this was totally retarded for a thousand dollar ''media pc'' to not have the card already. 
after all, isn't being able to watch and record tv the biggest feature of using xp media center?
