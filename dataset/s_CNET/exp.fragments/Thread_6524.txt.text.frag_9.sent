from the link you cited and says same as you indicate. 
spec indicates you can go 8gb ram at 667/533mhz or 4gb ram with 800 mhz ...assuming you find ram compatible with that mb in that quantity. 
some mb state they will run with 4 dimms but sometimes do not. 
check your os limitations before deciding how much ram to install.
