radeon 4650 pcie and 9000 pci sounds like a good way to go. 
i tried the 4350 which gave me good results and is a touch cheaper, but the fan was a little loud. 
i have no real benchmark to evaluate these because i had been using two old matrox cards in a 7 year old computer. 
the 4350 did provide much superior detail so i'm sure we're on the right track. 
thanks. 
by the way, do you happen to know if either of these cards can be used to watch cnbc (or at least listen to it) while trading?
