that seems odd unless the host is also running some dns (server) it's also odd to have a router do the dns work. 
didn't you discover that had other issues. 
i won't list them all but here's an old favorite. 
-&gt; the industry seems to have fixed that but other issues we bumped into had me use the real dns instead of the routers.
