this is why i wrote i don't have a do this cure. the site and what it does and the player it uses can thwart common cures. 
cnet tv has been a source of player trouble for some time. 
it's likely to be a nih ( ) syndrome as there are many that love to create new ways of doing the same old thing. 
good luck and i hope you find a cure. is it possible to swap which display is &quot;primary&quot;? i can do that on desktops.
