a dell photo aio 964 printer. 
i have it connected to a print server. the print server uses my netgear router for a signal. 
netgear router has wpa security enabled. 
i installed the printer drivers in all three laptops. 
no computer needs to be on to print. the printer can be anywhere within range of the netgear router, same with the laptops.
