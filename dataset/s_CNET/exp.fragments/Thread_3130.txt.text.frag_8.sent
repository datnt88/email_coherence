i know the history on this one and it hasn't been overclocked and isn't overclocked now. 
i mentioned that it has been on the default settings since day one in my first post. 
also, the person using it doesn't know much about computers, much less how to overclock one. 
i did reset the bios to the factory defaults while working on it just to see and nothing changed. the system was pretty cutting edge at the time it was new so it is likely around 3 years old. 
i could look up the papers to find the exact age if anyone thinks that would be helpful. 
this heat problem seemed to build up slowly over the past 6 months or so. 
i didn't always watch this but noticed it was getting warmer with time each time i gave it a look. 
i always assumed dust was in something but the heatsinks and fans were always clean. the heat wasn't mentioned to me until the computer became unstable during the latter part of last week. 
i finally got around to looking at it today and noticed the extreme heat.
