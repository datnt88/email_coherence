then you are mostly there. 
as i see it, routers enable two things; 1] wireless access to the internet for wireless capable computers anywhere around the home, and 2] more than one computer connected to the internet at once. the setup is computer --&gt; router --&gt; modem --&gt; internet. 
if you have a modem that allows more than one computer to access the internet, then you do not physically need any other hardware equipment. 
routers do not speed up your internet connection. 
if you have a 3 mb/s plan, you will not get faster speeds. 
in fact there is some slight slow down, but that is insignificant to us.
