do you get any bios display at all. 
if not, try shorting the bios &quot;clearing pins&quot; to return to defaults and reboot. 
if needed, set the jumper to allow bios clearing. 
if still no display, reduce system to basics and see if the system responds at all. 
it appears you may have a blown psu(power supply) if you open case and observe the cpu fan, what does it do? the other half is a bad mtrbd. 
or component holding down the system.
