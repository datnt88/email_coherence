:-(( yeah, i was afraid of that, but thought it was a bit much. 
the same av startup scan barely fazes my core2duo laptop. the new pcs i'm looking at for work are either a dell optiplex 780 core2 duo or quad from the outlet or the newer vostro 430 or optiplex 980 i5 650. 
do you think the i5 is worth paying more for if no heavy video work (no games, no video editing)? 
mostly word processing, quickbooks, coreldraw, itunes and internet use.
