sata ii (or 300) drives should have jumper pins on the back that allow you to place a jumper cap to force the drive to act as an sata 150 drive. 
check the hard drive maker's website for details on this. if the two sata motherboard ports are functional, then it may very well be possible to attach a second sata hd to the motherboard. 
you just have to find a place in the case to mount it. 
you may have to resort to placing the drive in an empty 3.5&quot; external bay or use a bracket to mount it in an empty 5.25&quot; bay. 
you will want to make sure that the hd has proper airflow to cool it--maybe install an external bay cooling fan.
