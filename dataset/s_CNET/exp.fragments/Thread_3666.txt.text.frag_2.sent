if you're talking about 2.5in. 
as in laptop hds, use a laptop adapter. 
this will convert, once out of the usb enclosure and attach to hd then to a int. 
ide cable of a system. 
most 2.5in. 
are jumpered as hd1(master), thus make sure its the only hd present or jumpered as hd2 or slave if used with a system and another hd. adapters are found online so google for one, but here's a quick source: you can then run your tests. 
i suspects, the hd just got too hot if they not cooled in thier enclosure, though most are vented. 
try using some enclosures with a fan for direct cooling to see if that helps.
