first thing to try is plugging in another monitor, 90% of all these types of problems are the monitor and/or cable. 
if the fault clears treat yourself to a new monitor, otherwise try and locate a new graphics card, bearing in mind that if the pc is that old you may have to buy second hand (ebay) to get one that will fit the slot! 
check how many separators there are when you look at the connections, this will tell you what type of agp bus it uses.
