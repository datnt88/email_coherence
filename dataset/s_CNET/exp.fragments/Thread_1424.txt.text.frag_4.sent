you must clearly understand upon any drop damage, you have &quot;physical damage&quot; to contend with. 
its not just some s/w corruption or glitch, true physical h/w is more likely at fault here. the other posters offered fixes but it still depnds on the hd itself has any chance of recovery. 
i include damage to the ext. 
case, its ports and/or electronics. 
once you swap the hd itself to another ext. 
usb case, that's your last chance as a end-user fix. 
if it does work then, then contact the pros to do this. 
also, let's be clear as well, all attempts at getting any data recovery under physical damaged condition may further corrupt or cause data damage beyond what was initially incurred. 
so don't proceed until you have some ext. 
case or kit to try it on. 
don't be mislead into voodoo fixes as these can only further damage the ext. 
hd more, which is why i posted. 
good luck -----willy
