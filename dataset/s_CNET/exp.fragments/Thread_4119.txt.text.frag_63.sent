a problem there could cause all three problems your discussing 'motion is choppy and the response to mouse or keyboard commands lags&quot; choppiness is a frame rate problem. 
lag in keyboard and mouse is slow i/o data. 
do all three of these. 
unplug all your wires wait thirty seconds, plug them back in again. 
( to repair poorly fitting connections. 
this a quality issue in the design (tolerances) of the connections.) reset the modem. 
check for new driver for modem. 
if your gaming use a wired not a wireless connection. 
still not fixed then .............. ? 
ddr3? 
(we need a make and model number on your pc to begin with.) you did say this was an older pc right? 
i'd stick with the ddr of the ram. 
this could cause a problem in the over performance of the motherboard, a compatibility problem with the processor and the northbridge (see link below) but to be sure you will need to speak with ati about it. 
see this: processor compatibility guides and this: graphics compatibility guides e-mail them from here: when dealing with hardware the devil is often in the retails. 
not: northbridge (computing)
