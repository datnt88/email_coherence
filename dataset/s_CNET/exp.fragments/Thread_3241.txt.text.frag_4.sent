depending on how old the lcd is, finding spares is out there in the &quot;used/spares&quot; vendors market. 
google for model# and see if so-so has anything and of course the full cost. 
if the lcd is real old and/or at least 3yrs. 
old, i would consider it a lost unless you really got to have it. 
in most cases a lcd subassy.(alone) or if used, maybe the whole assy. the cost varies. 
buying a new 19in. 
lcd, especially now during this xmas time, there has to be a decent deal out there, well worth the checking out. 
of course, there is ebay too just find a f1903 out there. 
btw, the hp f1503 and f1903 were part of a bad series of lcds that had poor componets used and caused failure. 
so, the parts got used/repaired often and/or these bad lcds were sold, so verify it is a working model component/lcd.
