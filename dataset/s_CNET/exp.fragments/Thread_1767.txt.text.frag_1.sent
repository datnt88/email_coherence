ok so this whole thing started a week ago. 
first though heres my system: dell dimension e510 windows xp proffesional intel pentium 4 cpu 3.00ghz (2 cpus) 2 gigs ram nvidia geforce 8600 gts phoenix rom bios plus version 1.10 a02 so i ordered the 8600 a week ago. 
when i first got it i tried installing it but realized my power supply (which was only 305 watts at the time) did not have the right plug to connect to the card. 
so i took it to a local computer store and they managed to hook it up. 
i brought it home and it worked fine until i started a game. 
basically when i boot up a game i hear the cards fan start up and then the screen goes black and then either stays like that or it reboots itself. 
i had this problem with all my games. 
i thought it could've been my drivers or something so ive uninstalled and reinstalled them multiple times but no luck. 
i emailed nvidia support and they said i needed at least a 450 watt ps so i went out and got a 500w one. 
i installed it and everything worked fine except the games again, it did the same thing. 
ive called dell support, nvidia, gone to my local computer store twice now and asked on many different forums, but to no avail. 
i would really appreciate any help. 
thanks.
