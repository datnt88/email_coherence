for excel and access. 
so given the cost to upgrade and the fact you have only got 2 dimms slots ..... here's what i'd get. 
you would have to remove the ram that came with the pc ... and install the 2 new dimms. 
since the pc is under warranty ....you may want to keep the original ram until the warranty expires in the unlikely event you have a problem with the machine and have to return it. 
let us know how it works out.
