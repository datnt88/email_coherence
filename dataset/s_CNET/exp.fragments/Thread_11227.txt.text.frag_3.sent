i have a 300w power supply on my computer and i have just recently added a geforce 6600 gt. it runs, but i have experienced glitching and stuttering in games. the point is this: you likely won't damage anything by running your upgraded system with a small power supply, but you may experience glitching and crashing. 
just buy a new power supply, you can get a decent one pretty cheap.
