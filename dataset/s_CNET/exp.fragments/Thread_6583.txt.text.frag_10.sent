because the cables and the router from the old setting are allready installed. 
please take notice that the router is not in my room, so if i need to connect a laptop (any laptop from friends who drop in) to my pc, i will need a port. 
i thought that a second ethernet card would solve my problem, but i wasn't sure, that's the reason for my visit to this forum. 
so please tell me if my proposed setup will work. 
i appreciate to learn better methods. 
so i may consider those for future use. 
bob thank you for responding leo
