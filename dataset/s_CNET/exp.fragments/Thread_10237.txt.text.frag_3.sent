thanks for your reply. 
im using a cable srvice provider. 
i set the other computer ip settings the same as my original computer. 
but this did not solve the problem because i had 2 network connections open, as soon as i disabled 1 connection i connected straight away. 
if i setup the internet on another computer and i double click on iexplorer how can i stop it to go into setup mode ie configure lan, configure dial up etc.
