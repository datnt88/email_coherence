i presumed that your cpu is a slot 1 cpu for i have never worked with a celeron of that age and speed that used a socket. 
if you did manage to find a compatible motherboard with compatible socket/slot and the correct voltage requirements then, you could easy swap the motherboard out with no problems. 
pin count does matter. 
while it might seem reasonable to put a cpu in a socket with more pins, you can not. 
other than that, just make sure that the motherboard supports the type of memory that you are using. 
make sure that the board is exactly compatible with your cpu and not a similar model based on a different core with different voltage requirements.(undervoltage/overvoltage 
can cause bad result for your cpu)
