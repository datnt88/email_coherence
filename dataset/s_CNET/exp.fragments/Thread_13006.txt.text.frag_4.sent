i see you don't want to head to to the solution and let others supply you a do this for a specific router but by doing so you could learn what you need to know about solving your issue. 
make better posts, get better answers is what i've heard. 
i did rewrite my first reply a few times and couldn't find a good way to tell you that leaving out details hampers everyone including you. 
i also can't be your &quot;tech support&quot; so i've taken to not duplicating ready web content about port forwarding and other topics. 
there are only so many hours in a day and only so many members that will reply. 
even less when the post is not complete.
