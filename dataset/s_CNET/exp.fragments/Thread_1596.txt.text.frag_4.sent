when it comes to desktop systems, the choice is really up to you. 
having dealt with x-number of various users over the years, some truly need help in the worst way while others can do without. 
so, you know better than anyone else where you fit in this spectum of users. 
imho, most don't need the extended warranty for a desktop. 
but, for a laptop i truly believe you really need it. the costs and the special componets that make-up a laptop aren't that generic and tend to be costy and hard to get. 
plus, all too often the user may cause extra problems fixing the orginal one.
