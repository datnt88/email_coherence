replacing a power supply is too easy. 
remove the case cover. 
unplug the power supply leads. 
with a phillips screwdriver remove the four mounting screws on the back. 
remove the ps. place the new ps in the same spot and replace the four screws. 
plug in the leads, they will only go one way. 
depending on the supply you may have leads left over. 
done.
