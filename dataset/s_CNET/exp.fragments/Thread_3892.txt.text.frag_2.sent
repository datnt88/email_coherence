things to try: 1. format the partition(s) on that disk. 
2. delete the partitons(s) and make new ones in stead. 
3. buy another hard disk. 
making a backup of files is much easier when it's still functioning than after it got fatal hardware errors like this. now - most likely - you have to pay a data recovery company to do it for you. 
this is the umptiest proof that external hard disks aren't to be used for storage. 
just for a quick copy of data to transport them to another pc. or for a second backup copy. 
preferably not even as primary backup.
