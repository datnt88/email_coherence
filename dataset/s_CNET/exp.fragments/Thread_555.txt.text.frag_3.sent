your system is hosed. 
if you have good ram available not the old one. 
install it and see what happens. the risk is yours. 
if it were me. 
i won't trust this system to be reliable any more, though you can be lucky. 
beware - good ram may fail, if the same ram slot is used and fry every ram stick you install. 
also possible the mtrbd. 
has taken a hit. 
usually 3-beeps suggest some ram problem, but investigate your model# mtrbd. 
and see what the &quot;beep code&quot; refers to. 
beeps can be long and short, so note the beep sequence. 
if you wanted a reason to &quot;upgrade&quot; here you go.
