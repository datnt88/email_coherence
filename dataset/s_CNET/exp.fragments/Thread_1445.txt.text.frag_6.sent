chances are there is nothing wrong with the router. 
periodically, comcast will send updates for the cable modems. 
sometimes, these updates interfere with the router's firmware, sometimes they require you to reboot the router and sometimes they require you to reboot the cable modem & router; especially when they've made a matrix change and you need to obtain a new comcast.net 
ip address. 
in many areas, comcast has been just that - updating their network, making the connections run as faster. 
in my area, they upgraded me to a 16mb line for free and now offer 32mb service for extra $$$. 
in either case, you shouldn't have to completely wipe out your router's setting to the linksys defaults. 
just unplug the cable modem, router for 30 seconds. 
first plug in the cable modem and wait until it has successfully synch'd with comcast.net. 
you will know this is done when the ''cable'' light stops blinking. 
now your cable modem has the latest and greatest synch paramters with comcast.net and is network addressable. 
then, plug in your router. 
this will allow the router to obtain the cable modem's ip address. 
assuming your router is setup for nat and dns, your clients (computers connecting either via wire (cat-5) or wifi, should reconnect and obtain dns ip's. 
good luck.
