basically when i restart my computer or stand by for long periods, the monitor fails to communicate with my computer. 
my configuration is this: computer(gfx card w/ dual dvi-d ports) &gt; dvi-d to hdmi converter &gt; hdmi cable to monitor please help me solve this problem, thanks! 
i'm thinking this could be a driver issue, or the hardware isn't right. 
is there anything i could buy (&lt;$50 if possible) other than a new graphics card or motherboard that can give my computer a vga or hdmi input?
