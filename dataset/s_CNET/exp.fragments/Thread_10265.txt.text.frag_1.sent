hello, inexperienced person here, but wanting to learn and thankful for this forum! 
ok, what i am trying to do is help a friend. 
because i have done a little web design for him he has come to me with a networking problem. 
however, i know little to nil about networking. 
-he owns restaurant. 
-wants to run pandora on outside dining area for patrons through a blue-ray to a tv. -wants it wired. 
-have not been there yet to (try to) troubleshoot myself. 
but i have a feeling i'll end up here anyway. 
-the pos (machine they take orders on) (windows xp os) connects to 2wire modem/router provided by dsl company. 
-then runs to what he says is a netgear ethernet switch through drop ceiling. 
-then runs to the sony blue-ray, connected to tv. -says it detects the connection but no internet. 
-what could be the most common cause that i might try. 
says network diagnostics function on blue-ray menu does say make sure dhcp is enabled.
