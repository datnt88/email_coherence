unless you intend to leave your dvds made for american consumption at home in the usa, the best solution is to just buy a region-free- or all-region dvd player. 
i brought a boatload of dvds back from a two-year trip to china home with me. 
i found a panasonic player online that handles the dvds better than my chinese player did. 
i hope that this helps.
