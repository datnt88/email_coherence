i have an intel imac running 10.5 and a hp laptop running vista. 
i have one external hard drive. 
i want to be able to share/store the music/picture files between the 2 computers via the external hard drive. 
how should the external hard drive be formatted to best fit this situation? 
i'd appreciate any info from those that have faced this problem before me and have a solution. 
thanks
