thank you, coryphaeus! 
i've been suffering with elongated images since i &quot;inherited&quot; an hpw19 from my son. 
(it came with his new computer. 
he couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.) i switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now i have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display. 
beautiful. 
should i tell my son? 
thanks again, ron
