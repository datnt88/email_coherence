okay, so i did what i was suppose to do...count the beeps an research....i think i got it now...i told ya i'am not a computer wiz ...i had 2 sticks of memory i inserted in the ram slots 0&1...same problem...beeps...so after a cooling off period...i thot maybe those were bad...so i pulled them out an put another stick ....guess what ...it loads up ...yep, no beeps...i think i just stuck the wrong type of ram sticks in...not that i understand the difference between sdimm or dramm or whatever.. i guess the motto is...dont get frustrated..step away for a while..oh and that just because they fit the slot ...dosent mean there right.
