i have looked at the new mainframe systems as well. 
the only problem with them and the main reason we are looking at migrating off them is the cost. 
the main focus of this migration is long term cost savings. 
the goal is to lay out x number of dollars to save x^2 over the next several years. 
not to mention saving the company that kind of money while i'm at intern could almost guarentee me a job as long as i don't screw up the rest of everything too badly. 
haha!
