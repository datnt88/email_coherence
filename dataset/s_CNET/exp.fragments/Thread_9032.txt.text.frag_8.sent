actually as i have mentioned in my first post itself that i am also not able to change any permission setting for the drive. 
it shows &quot;unable to save the changes in permission information&quot;. 
and same error windows have no access to this object. 
i think this is not a permission issue because in this case it is not even showing the disk capacity when i check properties.
