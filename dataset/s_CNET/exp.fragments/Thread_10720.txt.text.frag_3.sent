i did not put my internet ip because i am not sure where i did not use it in any of the configurations i mentioned. 
i thought i only would need the internet ip when i am trying to access the camera from the internet. 
did i draw an incorrect conclusion? 
all ip's mentioned are internal to my network. 
thanks for your assistance.
