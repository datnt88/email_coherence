ive put to gether a computer and im having trouble getting it to work. 
every time i select tthe partition to load it will take me to a screen giving me options about safe mode i have tried all the options and all that is happening is the computer is restarting. 
it came up with a cpu has been changed message and a message saying something about defaults being loaded. 
but so far nothing has worked. 
ive tried messing with the bios and changing the cmos battery ive tried loads of hard drives with different os installed on them but so far nothing has worked. 
its running ( well trying to ) amd athlon 1.3 ghz i think ( its what the bios is saying) nvidia ge force 8800 wd 60gb hdd 1.5 gb ram if you have a solution can you email me at mistachance@hotmail.com as i dont really check this much. 
any help is appreciated thanx oh i forgot to mention the mother board has sata chips and connections and ide connections im trying to run a ide hard drive.
