i know, probably a weird question. 
but i'm wondering if i could possibly get another lcd monitor (like the philips 190b6cs/27 19&quot; with one usb port installed) and attach some sort of vga-to-bluetooth adapter or something. 
if i could spend under $500 ($400 monitor, &gt;$100 adapter/bluetooth module) and add a second workstation in my living room using my pc i'm currently building (athlon 64 x2 4400+ 2.2 ghz duals, 2 gb ram, 250 gb hd 16 mb buffer, 256 mb ram w/ sli support, windows xp either mce or professional)... that would be a-m-a-z-i-n-g. 
it would cost $500-ish and use my $2200 build, a $6500 computer when including software and peripherals. 
anybody know of a solution? 
i'm sure i can't be the only one who could appreciate this benefit. 
sure i realize it's still sharing one computer and two people can't use it at once (probably), and i imagine software can handle input options (like a kvm switch) so input shows on both monitors or only one according to which key/mouse is used. 
okay pdd's (product developers and designers) get cracking! 
i wanna be able to buy this product within 12 months if it doesn't already exist..
