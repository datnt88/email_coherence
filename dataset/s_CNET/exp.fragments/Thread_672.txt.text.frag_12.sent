i checked the logs on one users computer before, and nothing unusual was showing, but then i also found out he was hotkeying to log off windows, so a log wouldn't show much there. 
if the only thing that is disconnecting is the rdc will that show in a log on the users computer or would you have to go after a log on the server. 
i think my memory is telling me that the main it person has looked at the logs on the server and cant find anything wrong. 
if it were once or twice a week for people across the board i would agree with you that it is just the nature of the internet and you are going to get dropped occasionally, and i have pushed that answer on the problem people frequently while i search for a solution, but i think it is wearing thin on them now. 
everyone in our office, the only one having problems, is on one switch, its a big cisco switch that is monitored by or voip provider, i would hope that when we first reported this problem they took a look at that, so i am kind of ruling out the switch, but that might not be wise of me. 
thanks a lot for your guys help.
