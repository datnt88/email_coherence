i have a toshiba satellite 1950-a740 (pentium 4 2.2ghz, 512mb ram, 40 gighd win xp sp2) i have a combo drive dvd/cd-rw drive [toshiba dvd-rom sd-r2212] about 2 months ago, it started giving me trouble, it will read data discs and install discs but will not recognize a dvd or burn a cd. i've put the recovery disk in but it doesn't offer me the choice to fix that drive, it's reformat all or nothing dvd's, the drive doesn't think there's anything in there. 
cdr/cd-rw when i try to burn (with xp or drag 'n drop cd) it appears to start the burn, then craps out at the end, and leaves me with an unreadable disk, a coaster or a frisbee. 
if anyone can offer some help please do. 
i let the drive slide for a while but a month ago, i had a baby girl and it's time to make some cd's for the grandparents. 
thanks, charles
