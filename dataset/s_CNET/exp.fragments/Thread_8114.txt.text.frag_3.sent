i know that the wcg200 is not the most ideal equipment for what i'm doing, but its all i have right now because it was left over from my previous residence where i had cable internet service. 
besides, it is functioning as a router because when connected with ethernet cables all the computers connect to each other and the internet. 
the only thing that doesn't work is when i try to connect the laptop wirelessly. 
it will connect to the network and share files and printers, but won't connect to the internet. 
any other suggestions?
