a system will fall back on &quot;virtual memory&quot; using the hd as if ram. 
so, you may not see this as a factor or more so. 
i suggeted getting the best cpu now rather than later as that's a major cost of a new system. the ram usually is capable, say you get 4gb for starters, you can add later if the need arises. 
i'm sure that's more than your current old pc. i would also like to add the benefits of x86-64bit os, which leads me to think you're using a 32-bit version of os. the 64-bit version will better handle mutiple core cpus and/or make use of it, but the s/w should be ready for such, is it? 
if your s/w is 64-bit capable even though though 32-bit will run it may find a better world with 64-bit, however i don't get into s/w matters that much any more, other than reading the details of it. 
further as i already stated check with vendors what they offer in details/specs and you can upgrade abit when you build and get better system as that's open to you.
