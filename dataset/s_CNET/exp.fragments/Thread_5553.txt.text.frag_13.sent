drive management would only give one partition and it ran out to only 39.4 gb, i deleted the partition, started over several times but could not find any options other than fat or ntfs and the one partition which formatted at 39.4. 
do i need to make any changes in my bios? 
this is a new dell 2400 running pentium 4, 256 memory and windows xp. as i indicated, this is not a boot drive, only for bulk storage.
