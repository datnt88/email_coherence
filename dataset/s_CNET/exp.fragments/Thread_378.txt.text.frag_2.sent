before i expect the modem to play nice, the os's you've listed don't install motherboard drivers for you and i see no mention of that step. 
many motherboards have irq routing issues that the motherboard drivers supply support for. 
microsoft will not install these for you by clicking of windows update or driver update. 
then you have the possibility the modem is just doa.
