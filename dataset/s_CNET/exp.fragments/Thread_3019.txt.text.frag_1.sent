i have a toshiba satellite m115-s3094 with the below specs. 
i want to upgrade to a larger drive. 
how much more performance am i likely to get from a 7200rpm drive vs. another 5400? 
how much will it effect the heat and the battery of the system? 
cost is not a significant factor and i will probably get a seagate. 
i am going to post this in the storage, peripherals, and bol, please if you answer only answer once not in all three unless you have something different to say. 
i value ya'lls i9mput, thanx, bill 1.6ghz, due, intel t2050 1gb ram 533mhz fsb 80gb 5400rpm internal sata
