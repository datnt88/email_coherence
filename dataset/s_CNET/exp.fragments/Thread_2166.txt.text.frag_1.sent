i have a silly question. 
i have a hp laptop, cost me a little over 2 grand. 
it has wireless built in, but i've been told by a friend that i could get better wireless with an orinoco pc wireless card. 
my question is, can i still use this pc card if i already have wireless built in. 
wouldn't it mess things up a bit? 
thank you all. 
geoff.
