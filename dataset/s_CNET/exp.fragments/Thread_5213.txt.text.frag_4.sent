if you want speed from an external hd, the enclosure with the external sata or esata connector is the way to go. 
note that sata and esata use different connector plugs. 
sata 150 or sata 300 would not really an issue for me--both are faster usb 2.0. 
check out performance differences here: (don't just look at &quot;interface performance&quot;)
