it totally slipped my mind to mention that some older games will look for certain parameters in devices but not recognize the newer updated devices even though they are more capable than the ones it's calling for. 
you are absolutely right and i'd just about lay odds that this is the problem. 
since i play the latest and greatest games while my old games collect dust in the infamous &quot;closet of old computer stuff&quot;, it's no wonder i haven't delt with this issue in a long time. 
lol
