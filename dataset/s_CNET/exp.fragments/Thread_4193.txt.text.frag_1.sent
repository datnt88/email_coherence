so i just bought a 4gb sony memory stick pro duo for my cell, and it came with an adapter, so i can plug it into my laptop. 
however, every time i do, i get a lovely blue screen and a free restart. 
when i put the 256mb sandisk that came with the phone in the adapter, it works fine. 
what's the deal? 
any way to fix it? 
thanks!
