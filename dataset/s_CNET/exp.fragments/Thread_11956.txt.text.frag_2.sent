seems broken. 
essentially, an external drive has 2 parts: 1. the case 2. the drive i'd start with buying a new case and mount the existing drive in it. 
then see if it works. 
could very well be. 
if it doesn't, buy a new drive also. 
that probably leaves you with one broken disc and one spare case for future use.
