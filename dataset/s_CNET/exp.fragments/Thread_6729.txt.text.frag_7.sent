tried it, and unfortunately no change . 
i've used several av and anti spyware programs (including avg) in both normal and safe modes, but they never turn up anything. 
i've made sure to get the most updated definitions but still no luck. 
i did scan with spyware doctor, which did find several infected files, but i'm not sure if it was just a ploy to get me to purchase the full version of their software? 
not sure what i can do at this point to recover the last 5 years of backed up photos, get windows media player working again, and get rid of the corrupted folders/files on my external drive.
