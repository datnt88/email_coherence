i found that the linksys wga54g usb adapter works well with the 360. 
you can often find it for considerably less than the microsoft adapter. 
previously using ms adapter, then router died. 
had to move to this as the ms adapter was incompatible with my new pre-n router from that i purchased from netgear.
