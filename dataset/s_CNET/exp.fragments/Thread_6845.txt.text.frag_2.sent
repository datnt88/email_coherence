when you change from dsl to cable broadband, you just change the router, there are no software changes on your computer required (or on the router, your question is not clear). 
now that you have your computer working directly on your cable modem you just need to record your computer's mac address, and set that as the mac address in your new cable router. 
other than that, you shouldn't have any problems. 
i've done this a couple of times, and just walked through the web configuration pages for the new cable router, and it just works (assuming that you transfer mac addresses). 
no software to change.
