hey guys, i have read briefly over the writings so far, and i have a very similar problem. 
my ts-l632d will burn dvd's without a problem, it will read dvd's without a problem, it will even read cd's without a problem. 
but when i burn a cd it burns like it should, it completes like it should, the light on the drive blinks like it should... but in the end... its just a blank cd... i heard a piece of advice, i should burn at a lower speed, this i will try, but is there any advice that can be given? 
other than that? 
if that doesn't work then how else can i fix it? 
also... if that does work, i don't want to burn at 2x from now on. 
alternatively i had a super-multi drive kickin' around so i've got it on my ide to usb adapter and burn from it, but that's not a perfect solution either
