so i have been getting screwed by the company ebellking, it seems they have a history littered all over the net of disappointed and let down customers. 
i believe making a small compilation of just a few of the complaints i found in 10 minutes of this company may save some people money, where so many of us seem to have lost. 
in this day of online lottery buying i believe we should look out for each other on things like this. 
do not trust ebellking
