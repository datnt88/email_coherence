i want to know what is best for me, and my family. 
generally we have three people on the wifi at once, being online research, socializing (skype, ect.), and gaming. 
i want the best for everyone, and ive had a netgear router and still do, but its like wearing out. 
its off and on functioning. 
i havent had a linksys so i have no base for those. 
we have windows8 and windows7 and an apple ipad on at once, generally. 
im not sure if these routers are windows8 compatible.. so whats best for me?
