scripts threads for still digital editing you need two things: 1. true color fidelity video card that support 32-bit color pallette at the highest horizontal refresh rate comparable with your monitor. 
16-bit color pallette is acceptable. 
2. 17&quot; or larger monitor that support 32-bit color at the color pallette size you want (32-bit); the screen resolution you want (1024x768) or larger; the smallest dot pitch that you can afford to buy; and the highest supported horizontal refresh rate at the screen resolution and color pallette size you want. 
video card works in tandem with your monitor. 
don't waste your money buying a high-end video card when your monitor can only support low-end resolution. 
check the specification of your monitor before buying video card. 
horizontal refresh rate of 75 hz or higher is strongly recommended if you were to spend alot of time editing pictures. 
higher rate may be required for some people who're more sensitive to &quot;flickering screen&quot;. 
higher refresh rate (horizontal) helps reduce eye straint/fatigue. 
first, find out the size of your monitor (14&quot;, 15&quot; 17&quot;, 18&quot;, 19&quot;, 21&quot;, etc.). 
next, find out the horizontal refresh rate of your monitor at the 16-bit color pallette and screen resolution of 1024x768 and at 1280x1024 resolution. 
repeat the above step with 32-bit color pallette, if applicable. 
you should see a table similar to this: ------------------------------------------ monitor screen color
