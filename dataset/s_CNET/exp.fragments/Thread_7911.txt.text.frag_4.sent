a &quot;legitimate&quot; os you bought would have an install cd. you don't have that so what you appear to have is a pre-installed oem version. 
again this is all setup to make it very hard to impossible to move the os to another machine because you don't have the install cd. -&gt; it seems very hard for some to grasp the issue. the parts are indeed scavenge able but the os may be a dead item. 
let's see that install cd. the least expensive version of xp is over at newegg.com. 
and if you just need to eek by till next year &quot;windows 7 rc will expire on june 1, 2010.&quot; so you can use that till then.
