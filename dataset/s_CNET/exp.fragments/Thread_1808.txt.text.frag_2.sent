ah and it just restarted itself right after i finished with that post. 
just to add some info when i'm already typing this ... it's xp sp2 (doesn't really matter because it was happenening even without any os installed). 
ah and my cpu is a celeron 2,93 (and it was working fine for 2yrs or so) i've tried to clean it's cooler, which doesn't seem to help either. 
it was working fine for 2 years, without signs of overheating but who knows... it's temp is around 50c most of the time, if we can trust fanspeed or whatever program i was using before i formatted it. 
sadly i can't dl it right now as my pc would crash again -.- and checking its temp in bios wouldn't help because it's not using that much % anyways, when in bios. 
what's even funnier 2 days ago i could play games without problems (if pc starts at all and doesn't restart in first few mins) and everything was ok, but it would simply restart when browsing web or just leaving it idle... ah and it restarted all the time using flash video... not flash sites, just watching flash videos... i feel like watching a bad horror movie where people are trying to figure out what's happening but everyone is left in the dark 'till the end of it ;o) i'm just left clueless right now... :/ cheers
