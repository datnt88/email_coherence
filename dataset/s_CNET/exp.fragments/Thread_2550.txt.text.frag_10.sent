are you limiting yourself to epson and canon and not considering hp or lexmark or some other brands? 
in that case, i think epson is better. 
i had started using epson wayback (epson dot matrix), and is still using a six year old stylus color 440 while my friends bought canon. 
mine is still working, while they had already replaced theirs (and with epson brand too). 
in comparison, canon inks should be more expensive since their inks have their print heads in it like hps.
