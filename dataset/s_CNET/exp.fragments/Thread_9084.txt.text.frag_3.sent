i like both canon and epson... but as a photographer i sale prints and i have to use epson because of the pigmented ink they use... canon as well as hp claim 100 years print life but its not true... ive done the test to a photo on a ip6600d i printed a photo on canon high gloss 4x6 and set in the sun for a few weeks it faded!!! ..pigmented ink is not affected by sun light or oxygen so unless your photos are handling damaged they could possible last a life time ... on dpi canon has a higher dot per ink because they have more nozzles and the nozzles are smaller then epson... but they use dye ink like hp .... so even though epson is at 5760x1440 pigmented ink has a rounder smoother droplet ... so i many situations epson prints can look for vivid and even clearer then canon...rx700 is some of the new breed of epson which have addressed the clogging print head issue and i use a r340 with and so far so good... canon's also clogg so either way you go... the epson has cooler features also like it can scan negatives and slides... and print right on to cd/dvd.... hopefully this is helpful
