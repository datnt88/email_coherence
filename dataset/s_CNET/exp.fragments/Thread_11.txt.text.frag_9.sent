support for eee family eee pc 1215n change your model add to my favorite register knowledge download specification warranty policy bob, i found this on asus support for my laptop eee pc 1215n: optimus support hdmi 1.4a 3d display specification so display can't support clone mode. 
page tools solution the lcd and crt display output from intel gpu. the hdmi display output from nvidia gpu. 
because the nvidia gpu can't sync intel display data for calpella platform,so that is nvidia gpu limitation for this architecture.
