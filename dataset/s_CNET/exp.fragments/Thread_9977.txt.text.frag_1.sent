so i'm building a budget gaming pc and my budget is about $500. 
i have picked all the parts that i want to buy and want to know some professional advice on the products and if its a good line up. 
i will be buying from newegg.com, also i already have an optical drive and a 500w psu so i should be set with that. 
my other big question is do i need to buy extra parts like sata cables, thermal paste, screws, etc? anyways, here's my list: &lt;div&gt;ram: &lt;/div&gt; case: 500 gb hdd: &lt;div&gt;mobo: &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;video card: &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;cpu: &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;cpu cooler: &lt;/div&gt; i'm new to this thanks!
