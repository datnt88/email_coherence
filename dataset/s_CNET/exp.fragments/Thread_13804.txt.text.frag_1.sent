i have an e machine desktop thats about 6yrs old. 
i have an internal seagate 100gb hdd ata 100. 
so i assum it's a eide or pata. 
cpu specs: intel celeron d 352, 3.20ghz/533mhz fsb, nvidia 8400 gs 512mb video card, 2gb ram, dvd rom/cd r+w, 10/100 ethernet 512kb l2cache. 
i had installed a wd 320gb, worked for a while but kept going in and out. 
i put ubuntu on it and it recogzied the 320gb but couldn't play any our of pc games. 
i have been looking for a seagate 500gb to put in but can't find one. 
when i tried to install the wd, it said no hard drive found. 
so i thought maybe it was a compatibilty issue between manufactuers. 
anyone have any suggestions. 
thanks
