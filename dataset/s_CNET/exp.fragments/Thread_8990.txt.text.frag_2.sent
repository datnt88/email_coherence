i defer to the maker for support. 
sorry but i must. 
your complaint is well known and i lay the issue at the maker's door. 
ok, but how do i extend a router's coverage? 
i use this phrase on google if you don't know about it -&gt; how to use a router as a wap? 
i never have this issue with the usual wap setup. 
-&gt; as to your login to the repeater, i find myself resetting the repeater to it's factory setting then doing it all over.
