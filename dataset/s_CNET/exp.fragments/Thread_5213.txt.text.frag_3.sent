i found a vantec drive enclosure that supports usb and esata connections. 
it also includes a bracket that would allow me to connect it to the motherboard port, assuming that the sata ii drive will work on a sata-150 port. 
by using it as an external drive, i wouldn't have to worry about heat problems, where to mount it or power supply compatibility. the seagate owner's manual says that the jumpers on the drive can be used to allow the drive to work with sata-150 but what would that mean in terms of speed? 
would connecting through the motherboard be significantly faster than using the usb connection? 
i'm sacrificing the drive's higher speed potential for easier connectivity and maybe that's the best i can do under the circumstances.
