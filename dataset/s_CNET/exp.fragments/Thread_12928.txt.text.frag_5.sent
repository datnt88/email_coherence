thank you v.much for your support.. but could i ask u how to know if the psu is the reason or not?? cuz my psu is atx-300w and i don' know if it good to the motheboard and the processor socket..and i didn' find it in the manual of the mb?? or i have to open the psu to know it myself (as the links that u put told, to discover if there was an overloaded)?? and if i didn' find any sign about overloading, how to discover about lowloading?? and thanx again for your support that came in the right time..
