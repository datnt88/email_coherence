i've had my hyundai image quest l90d+ for about 4 months. 
yesterday, i was using my computer and i noticed that i have two lines running from top to bottom. 
one is about an inch from the vertical edge of the monitor, the other is about two inches from the vertical edge of the monitor. 
i disconnected my monitor and unplugged it. 
i let it sit overnight and reconnected it this morning. the lines are still there. the only difference is that instead of one line being blue and the other line being red, one line is now green and the other line is blue with a hint of red around the edges. 
how can i fix this problem? 
anyone else have this problem with the l90d?
