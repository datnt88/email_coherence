i am running xp os and i installed a airlink model awlh3026. 
it recognizes my wireless network but it will not connect to the internet. 
if i try to launch a browser, i get the message &quot;page can not be displayed.&quot; is there something that needs to be set on my router? 
my router is a linksys model befw11s4. 
thanks in advance.
