my experience tells me that a simple cdrom drive is much more capable of reading scratched or otherwise &quot;damaged&quot; disks than a writer or a combo. 
i find that utilities like cdr diagnostics, iso buster etc are able to handle a wider range of the so called dead cd's in a simple cdrom drive than in other combined drive/writers. 
as far as dvd's go, i'm not ready to make any observation as of now.
