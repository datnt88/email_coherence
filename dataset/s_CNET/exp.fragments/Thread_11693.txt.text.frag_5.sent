i have learned to bide my time on such things. 
i have already put aside any idea of upgrading any machines that we don't have to in anticipation of the changeover. 
i already see the price plummeting over the past month and xp-64 may not be what we'll be installing for these workstations. 
in the case of the next setups, it's open office and some development work in c++. 
since it will run windows 2000, we can do that with a dual boot to some linux-64.
