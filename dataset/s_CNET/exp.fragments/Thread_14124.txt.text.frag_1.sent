i am researching components in while i save up for my first pc build. 
the goal is to build a budget/low end htpc. 
i don't know if i have a need for an htpc and really just want to do the build for fun/curiosity. 
it may end up as a general purpose desktop when it is all said and done. 
what would be desirable specs for a processor in a build like this?&lt;div&gt; i sifted through processors on newegg and made a list of processors with 65w or less, most current sockets, and $100 or less with up to $125 as a grey zone. 
this leaves the celeron g530/540, pentium g600 &amp; g800 series, athlon ii x2 series &amp; x3 400e series, amd a4 apus and the a6 3500 apu. the i3-2100 is in the grey zone. 
i currently am leaning toward the a6-3500. 
are there any big downsides to going with it vs an athlon ii x2/x3, pentium g800 series, or i3 2100?&lt;div&gt; i purposely left out discussing form factor to keep this post shorter. 
i plan on starting a thread when i look into motherboards. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
