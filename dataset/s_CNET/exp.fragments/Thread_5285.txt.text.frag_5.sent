if so then check out the intel core duo extreme edition while for amd look at the athlon fx. if though you do have a bit of a budget then that can be ratcheted down to just the core duo for intel and athlon 64 x2 for amd that can also be pretty good. 
another factor is to look at the requirements for the games you want to play on it. 
what kind of requirements do they have and do you want to do any overclocking on this system?
