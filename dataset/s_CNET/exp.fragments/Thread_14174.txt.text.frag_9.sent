now my quandry is this...i had read a couple weeks ago big discussions about the problems with this particular model. 
i am not sure what the problem was but i read there was one. 
it was allegedly going to be fixed in this month..may. 
do any of you know if the problem has been fixed? 
and if not how will i know the problem has been fixed? 
kim ps thank you for all your insightful replies!
