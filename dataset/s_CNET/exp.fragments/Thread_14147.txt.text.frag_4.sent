i moved the hard disk to a properly working machine and booted ntpasswd to reset the passwords. 
i never booted that hard disk in another machine (very important!) put the hard disk back into the original machine and i was done. 
sorry to hear your machine needs repair. 
did you call dell while it was in warranty to have them correct this error?
