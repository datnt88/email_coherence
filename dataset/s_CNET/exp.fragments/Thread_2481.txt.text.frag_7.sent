failed to support ddr 400 as advertised. 
i believe that asus refused to replace the mobos, although they should have. 
maybe get on their back, start nicely, and then get tough. 
maybe they'll replace it. 
i think that they came out with an a chipset that did support 400 mhz. 
that is the one weakness for amd cpus. 
amd does not make chipsets and are the mercy of via and sis. 
now that nvidia has joined in, things are a little better, but still some glitches.
