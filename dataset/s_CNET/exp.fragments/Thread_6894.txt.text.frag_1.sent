why do all ram makers intentionally make density specs unreliable? is it to make money off markets even when the product isn't compatible? 
kingston and crucial memory finders, as are others, are infamous for reporting incompatible ram all because of this. 
real examples(2gbx1): 128x8=8 128bit 128mb chips 128x8=8 64bit 128mb chips per side 128x64=16 128mb chips at 64bit each 128x4=4 128bit 512mb chips 256x64=8 256mb chips at 64bit each fyi: i believe there are even more specs just for 1x2gb alone.
