ok, i know it sounds weird asking if something thats free is worth it, but heres the story. 
i was at my buddies house today and i noticed his partialy gutted computer lying around. 
i asked if he would be willing to part with it and he said i could have it for free if i wanted, since he had no use for it. 
thing is, its missing some key components. 
its missing a processor, but thats no problem, i have an athlon xp 3000 lying around. 
its missing a graphics card, but thats not a problem either, i have various agp graphics cards around my house. 
missing a hard drive, but i have a pata hard drive lying around as well... what i dont have lying around is ram. it takes pc3200, two slots. 
a trip to the futureshop website showed a 1gb stick for 30 bucks (kingston) so i would probably get 2 of those for 60. another thing i dont have is a monitor. 
a good lcd will set me back what, 150, 160 dollars? 
so i feel like im spending too much money and effort on a pc thats realy quite old and slow, but i always wanted to have a desktop in my room so :lol: . 
so do you guys think im wasting money, or is this a reasonable amount to spend to fix up a pc this slow? 
thanks for reading this far.

and then theres a keyboard, mouse, and wireless card since it will be in my room and there is no physical connection near there.
