brought a second hand desktop just last week. 
a compaq deskpro with a piii 800mhz processor and running windows xp home. 
everything was going great until the keyboard and mouse started behaving stupidly. 
the keyboard wouldn't work with the mouse plugged in. 
i changed keyboards, and it now works. 
however, the mouse is still behaving erratically. 
when i boot, everything works fine, then the mouse will freeze a couple of times, then start, and then stop working all together. 
it's very annoying, to say the least. the only temporary fix is to restart windows, but i cant do that every time to mouse freezes as it usually does it less than two minutes into running. 
any help would be wonderful.
