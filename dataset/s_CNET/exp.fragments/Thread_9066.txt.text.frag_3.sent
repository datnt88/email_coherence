isn't it possible, just guessing, that something on the internet is triggering this keyboard malfunction and then later it goes away? 
i'm not all that savvy with this stuff but i know these online trojans and other garbage can do strange things once they get into the system registry. 
of course if that is not possible then i guess i should start looking at a new keyboard, right?
