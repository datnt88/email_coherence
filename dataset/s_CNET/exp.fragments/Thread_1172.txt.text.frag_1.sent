hey im relatively new to this website and to the advanced computer society. 
so please use simple wording for me. 
id hate to make an entire new thread just to figure out what u were saying. 
anyways ive been trying to format my dell inspiron 8400 desktop, but everytime i try to install windows on my computer it says my hard drive isnt installed. 
but if i just let the computer start up windows runs, poorly, so i know there's a operational hard drive. 
any advice?
