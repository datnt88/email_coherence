yeah i've done that as well, opened the case dusted it gently with pressurized air can etc the machine itself is running windows 7 on an i7 core 16gigs ram it has a 550 psu. 
anything else that i could provide you with? 
at the moment i have it turned on with just the keyboard and mouse plugged in. 
i've also hear that it could be that the computer isnt recognizing the usb devices plugged in and so it's not feeding them power is that correct?
