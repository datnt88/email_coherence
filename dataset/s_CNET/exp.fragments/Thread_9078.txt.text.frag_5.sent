thanks. 
i was reading more into the power supply issue for the conection to my card and found that they make a adaptor which takes 2-4pin connections and converts them into a 6pin if i understand this corrcetly. 
i think most cards come with this adaptor. 
im thinking of going with the pny 8800 gts (640mb). 
thanks for your help
