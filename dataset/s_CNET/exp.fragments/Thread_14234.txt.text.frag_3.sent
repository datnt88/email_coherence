i was thinking of overclocking the 3.73 to 4.0. 
i have seen gaming benchmarks with the ee overclocked to 4.0 and it was performing only a little bit under the fx-55. 
plus, i am guessing the other parts that i am getting will make up in performance in the games. 
i have a 120 internal and 60 external that i will use. 
i was thinking about getting one raptor but would only one sata hd ruin the point of raid? the case is the first koolance item i listed under &quot;stuff i already have&quot;. 
the water cooling system is built into a custom lian li case.
