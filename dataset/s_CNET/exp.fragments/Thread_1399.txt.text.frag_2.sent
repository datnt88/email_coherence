your cpu is overheating and good ole intel is stopping the cpu from burning up. 
possibly the fan on the hsf [heatsink fan combo] that cools the cpu is dead or clogged with dust bunnies. 
take the cover off of the tower and clean out all the accumlated dust. 
it is in no way a sign of poor housekeeping, lol, it is quite normal
