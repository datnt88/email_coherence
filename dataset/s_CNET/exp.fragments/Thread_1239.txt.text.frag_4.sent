i'm running into usb printers that do not support windows 95, 98, me, or any version of windows nt. also i run into people that didn't realise that motherboard drivers may be needed to get the usb to function proper. 
more information about the os support would be at the printer makers web site. 
more information about the motherboard drivers can be gleaned from bob
