in other words, you hear the default tone? 
i'd check in disk manager to see if the drive shows there as unpartitioned space. 
if so, that could account for it's disappearance in explorer because it would have no drive letter. 
if not, and you have a pc available, you can remove the drive and connect it to a motherboard port to see if it shows there. 
if you care to go one step further and know the drive's manufacturer, you can try to download their diagnostic utility to see if it can find and test the drive.
