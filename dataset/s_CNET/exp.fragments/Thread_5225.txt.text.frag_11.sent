thank you for your help, i guess i have to stay with the working configuration. 
but then i have another question regarding the 'fixed ip' on a couple of laptop involved in the lan. 
those laptop are configured to use the adsl with fix ip address. 
what should be done to make it 'mobile' from one lan/network environment to another (i.e. from the adsl modem lan/network to cable modem lan/network -- or from office to home lan/network) thank you again for the help
