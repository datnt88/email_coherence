this may be something that has already been discussed...i have a pc now and take a lot of large digital pictures. 
i am looking to get an external harddrive to store my photo's on. 
i am also going to be purchasing a mac soon...that brings me to my quesiton...if i buy a hard drive and connect it to my pc and dump all of my pictures on it, will i be able to then connect it to my mac (when i get it) without losing any of the pictures? 
or is it better to wait to get the hard drive and continue to store pictures on cd's for the time being?
