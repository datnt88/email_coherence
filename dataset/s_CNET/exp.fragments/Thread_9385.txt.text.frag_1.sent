hi, i had a major problem with my computer recentley, it got some virus and it totally ruined the whole computer so i had to wipe the hard drive and restart the computer from new (like brand new from the shop!) the thing is i had lots of personal things on the computer like 100s of photos, college work ect ect that i dont have anywhere else, is there anyway the computer would still have these on the system?? is there any software that can be used to track them down on the computer or are they gone forever?! cheers, if anyone can email me at partydrummer83@hotmail.com i would be very thankfull
