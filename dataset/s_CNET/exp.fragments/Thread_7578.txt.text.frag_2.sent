good review, nile. 
thanks. 
quick question: are there different kinds of u135 models out there in regard to batteries? 
i'm looking for a netbook and the u135 was rated as one of the higher overall, so when i saw one on &quot;sale&quot; yesterday, i was considering getting it. 
then i checked here on the u135 and found it was priced about $75 cheaper online. 
when i looked at the specs on it, i found that it has a 3-cell battery. 
but the guy at the store (who seemed to know a bit about it, but of course appearances can be deceiving) told me it was a 6-cell. 
i would've thought that a factory model of a computer/laptop/netbook would be been fixed: an msi wind u135 has this, and this, and this, period. 
but are there different sub-categories within that model? 
in short, is there a u135 with a 6-cell battery, or are they all 3-cell and did i dodge a bullet by passing on the inflated &quot;sale&quot; yesterday?
