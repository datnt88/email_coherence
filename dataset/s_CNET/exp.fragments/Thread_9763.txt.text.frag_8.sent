thanks for the lead. 
i had already uninstalled a previous burner (only files i found still around were log files). 
no new driver updates available. 
autofix still doesn't help. 
i'm becoming very concerned - nothing seems to help and i don't even want to consider new drives as i don't think two drives would mechanically fail at the same time. 
i'm trying to be hopeful that there's still something i can do to correct the problem. 
any other suggestions? 
- i'll try anything.
