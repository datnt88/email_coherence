i dont know what happened..but one day i couldnt log on to the internet...i figured it was the weather that caused it..so i ignored it..but the next day the same thing happened..and it was like that for about 3 days...finally i decided to call my isp..who sent me a new modem..same problem ...i called them again and this time they said it wasnt their fault..that i had a virus. 
so i called dell...spent hrs with them on the phone (as usual)...only for them to tell me i dont have a virus. 
so the isp dunno whats wrong...neither does dell..but they refused to come look at the pc themselves. 
so i called mcafee...and got some recording saying i need to pay per minute in order to get help( iwasnt gonna pay for that)... dell called me back a day later..saying that i should reformat my computer ..and that it was my only option (they still didnt know what was wrong)....i reformated the computer...hrs later my service came back..after one week of hell.
