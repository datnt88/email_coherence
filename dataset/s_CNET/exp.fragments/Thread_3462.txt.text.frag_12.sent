yes linkit i have a simple three-computer home network with a wireless router and a modem connection to the canada bell broadband service. 
it has been working flawlessly for the past two or three years untill my hdd got fried. 
what i don'r understand is that the adapter icon appears unmarked and kosher in device manager but can't be persuaded to show up in the network window. 
considering the time i'm spending on this problem, i would ne better off to just buy another adapter with its own install disk. 
they're cheap enough but i'm hooked on solving this mystery. 
good night or good morning as the case may be.
