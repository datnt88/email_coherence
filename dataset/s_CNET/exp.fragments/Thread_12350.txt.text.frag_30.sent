western digital works very well with macintosh computers. 
western digital is also very reliable. 
i've used several hdd's and my western digital hdds were always the most reliable. 
i've never had one crash. 
i can't say that about seagate or maxtor. 
and i've had a plethora of drives ranging from 10-200gb in size.
