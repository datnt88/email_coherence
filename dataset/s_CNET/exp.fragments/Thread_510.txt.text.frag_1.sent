i am using the monitor that came with my dell dimension 4600. the display on the screen constantly resizes itself especially after the computer has been off for a while. 
when i turn my computer on the display is too big to fit the screen and then after i change it to smaller, the display begins to shrink so there is a 5mm black area around the screen. 
is there anything i can do to fix this?
