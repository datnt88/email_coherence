i have the hp d4999t but with 4.0gb ram, some nvidia gt240 video card and well, it's very nice on windows 7. this looks to be twice the ram and a few steps back on the nvidia geforce g210 but that's quite a nice machine to have. 
just one note. 
be sure to create those recovery dvds as many forget and later they discover why we need those.
