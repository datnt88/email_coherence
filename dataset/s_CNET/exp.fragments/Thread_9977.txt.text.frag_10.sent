ok, i think your right about the crossfire board. 
so if i wanted to buy a better gpu in the future, i can just pop it in instead of only using the 6770 or lower? 
also the hdd choice is way better too. the only problem that i find with that is there a lot of reviews claiming that they aren't working right and dying right off the bat? 
idk but maybe i should listen to that. 
i appreciate your &quot;book&quot; (lol). 
anyways, the price for everything is around $520, and i'm planning on buying the gpu separate maybe a bit later and i get a 15 dollar newegg gift card with my purchase which is going to save me some money. 
i just need to look more into hard drives and i think that you have got my mind set on what i need...
