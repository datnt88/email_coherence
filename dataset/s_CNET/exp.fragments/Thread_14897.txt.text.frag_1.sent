i have a imac hand me down from my dear brother. 
it has never failed me. 
i love it and i love mac. 
however it is time for me to move on to a laptop so i can be more productive in my business. 
i have been out of the computer shopping game for a while...in fact i don't think i have ever bought a computer in a store, just second hand or hand me down. 
so i am coveting the macbook because the size and the dual platform capabilities so i can finally use some of the business software that is only made for windows. 
i don't think i have ever done as much research as i am doing before i lay down it seems almost $3,000 after you add in all the necessary stuff (memory, ram, parallel, applecare) and the bells and whistles (airport express, speakers). 
it's a lot of money. 
anyway to this point i have a couple of options as where to make my purchase and could use some other consumer feedback. 
my options are: - of course the apple store - macmall.com - are bundles more affordable? 
if so which should i get? - tek serve (in manhattan) - a one-stop shop, very knowledgeable and helpful - a professor friend at a university - gets a mac discount - or your recommendation of a legitimate online or store source thanks in advance for your help. 
i need to get this thing in the next couple of weeks.
