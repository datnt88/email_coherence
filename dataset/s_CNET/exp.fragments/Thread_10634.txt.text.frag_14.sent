try changing your fios router with a standard dlink, netgear or linksys router. 
my samsung katalyst t-mobile phone works fine with wifi with my dlink wbr 2310 router(switched to dlink dir 625 and it still works). 
if the fios router is in only wireless g/n mode or in wpa2 mode, your samsung won't connect. the fios router must also be broadcasting ssid. 
good luck!
