its ntfs. 
i have read the post you referred to. 
i have a slightly different problem. 
i have a laptop, so i cant change the hard disks. 
also, even if i dont connect the external drive to my laptop and just power the drive on, it gives me the beep sound (its more like when we open a inbuild tv game)and then it seems as if the drive is attempting to start but its unable to. 
it happens 3 times and then dead silence.
