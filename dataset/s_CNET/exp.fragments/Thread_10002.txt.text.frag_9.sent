the best way to prove you have a bad monitor is swap it to another system and check results. 
if it remains blank then bad. 
from your description of problem either the back-ight or lcd power(inverter)bad. 
if repairable, check online for parts and/or repair services provided its worth it to you. 
a quick check is to use a flashlight at an angle with the display/system attempting to boot and notice if screen appears in fade display. the inverter problem is a power module/unit that's failed. 
i exclude any other issue with lcd display, but those usually cover many display problems. 
of course, if you have warranty, use it.
