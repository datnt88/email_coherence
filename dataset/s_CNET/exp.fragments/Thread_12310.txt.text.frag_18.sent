i hope you are on this board for a long time. 
you're very helpful, no one else had offered me this type of information. 
i had no clue. 
yeah kazaa was a bear as soon as i installed it my adware alerts and mcafee started popping up all sorts of alarms. 
it was amazing. 
who knows that may be when my problems really started but i would never have known to suspect that. 
just seems like it's been going on forever. 
can't wait to get home so i can do some troubleshooting. 
you're making me smarter.
