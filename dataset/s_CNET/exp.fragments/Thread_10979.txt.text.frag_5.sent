unless, the oem maker supplies a drive tray panel that replaces the one currently installed, then *any* other drive will work. 
the part that flips down as it were is intended to give way and the std. 
drive tray panel is still attached to the drive you just installed. 
in other words the cases is separate from the drives. 
the drives don't have any special panel that attaches to &quot;themselves&quot;. this should be an obvious feature you can check on. 
however, some pc drives did have tray panels that were part of the case and tray and not case alone. 
dell, no thought provides even the replacement procedure via the support website on how to replace cd/dvd drives. 
follow your model# and see what the docs provide. 
last, if your last option here if there is a spare empty drive bay, use it. the empty bay with it's frt. 
panel removed is intended for other drives, though it won't be keeping with the overall design. 
but, you will have access to your new drive.
