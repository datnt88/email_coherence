i love this program. 
i used windows live sync for years, when it existed and supported xp. i kept 2 work computers, one home computer and one laptop with all the same files via sync. the entire program rolled into windows live mesh, but only works with windows 7. i actually upgraded all my computers to windows 7 last year just to continue to use this program. 
it is much easier to use than dropbox and others mentioned, plus it is free, plus it is not limited by a certain gb limit, just the size of your hard drive.
