i have an hp officejet 4500 desktop. 
i just started using it recently and had to purchase ink right away. 
after buying a new cartridge, again it ran out after printing approx 20 black &amp; white pages. 
i thought the cartridge was defected and returned it. 
i have since bought 3 more and all have been the same!!!! there is nothing wrong with the ink, it is the hp printer . 
it uses way way to much ink. 
i just replaced it yesterday and printed only 15 pages and it is already out again......what printer do i need to buy??? i need one that gives me top quality printing without costing a fortune.
