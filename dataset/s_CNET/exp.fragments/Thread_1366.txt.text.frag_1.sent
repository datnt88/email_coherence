i already own the 4 matching monitors, all are acer x243w - 24inch widescreens, i currently have 2 hooked up thru my computer off the video card, but would love to have all four *if not for maybe 3?) hooked up for a reallly extended desktop. 
what i am looking for is advice on what will work to make this happen or if this is even possible given my current equipment and setup. 
i own an hp m7760n multimedia computer 2.13 ghz core 2, 2 gig ram, vista home premium, the only upgraded item is the video card, i put in an msi 8600 geforce gt card in it so i could run dual dvi monitors. 
i checked out the hp page and it says i have one pci express 16, and 3 pci slots, i am using that geforce gt card in the pci express 16 slot, so available i have 2 pci's and the onboard video. is it possible at all to use the onboard video to add at least a 3rd monitor? 
i hooked one up and rebooted but it didn't seem to recognize there was a 3rd monitor... is there anything in the bios i need to adjust to allow onboard video to work with a pci express card or is this just not going to work? 
i saw an option of a pci card by ati that supported upto 4 monitors, would that work in my pci slot? 
(there is also a pci express 1 version) but i dont have a pci express 1 slot. 
just trying to learn what i could do (if anything) to add a 3rd or 4th monitor to this system and make it all &quot;work&quot;. 
thanks for any help on this.
