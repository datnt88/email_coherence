concentrate on keeping your system cooled and powered. 
so get the p/s and any fans you desire then proceed with the other h/w. 
in the long run, you'll be happier even though the p/s and fans don't add anything but stability to the system, its worth it before speed and those goodies. 
good luck -----willy
