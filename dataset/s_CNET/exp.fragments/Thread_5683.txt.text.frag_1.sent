for some reason as soon my roommate installed his roku box i have been having ip conflicts on my laptop, and my laptop alone. 
i cant figure out how to get them to work together, even after releasing and renewing my ip. i have also made sure that my dhcp is enabled. 
i am running two routers- one that has a modded dd-wrt, but i dont think thats an issue.. any ideas?
