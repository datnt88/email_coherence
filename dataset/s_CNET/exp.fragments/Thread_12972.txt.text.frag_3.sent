before you send it back, you should check to see if maybe the reciever is planted too far from the keyboard, or if there's anything that may interfere with the usage/signal of the two. 
also, the batteries may need changing. 
if you use rechargables, they have less voltage than regular alakline batteries. 
just chipping in my 2 cents.
