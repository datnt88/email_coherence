because you have issues with this laptop already and now a static one, it seems too much is going on. 
with all this happening, you may a warranty problem and have to escalate it for a true repair or refund. 
of course static(esd) is part of your environment. 
if you have such an issue, you're the cause as well as the home. 
you as a person transmit or allow as you're the conduit for esd passage. 
a properly grounded modern home will provide a path to discharge if you touch anything already grounded. 
there are desktop style static touchpads for such use. 
you can then touch laptop. 
a &quot;anti-static floor mat&quot; can help as well as using static sprays if alot of static build-up is happening. 
while you mentioned it maybe the battery then you got a &quot;electrical issue&quot; not a static one. 
let's be clear if all of this is happening, then the 1st sentences above applies. 
then again, if you truly have a static problem, then its not hp laptop fault, this is something you have to resolve. 
i have provided some solutions above. 
you can also take the laptop to a totally different area(someone's else home or library) and check out results there.
