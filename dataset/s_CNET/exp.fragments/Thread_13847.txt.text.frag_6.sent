ok, i guess the mystery is solved, today i connected ps3 straight to the wall instead of gigabit switch. 
and yes, that was my bottleneck. 
i had forced ps3 to connect at gigabit speed and this time it said the ethernet cable is not connected, so in other words i won't be getting gigabit speeds without tearing my house apart to upgrade cabling. 
or using a really long cable between the rooms, but that is far from neat. 
thanks for your help, guys.
