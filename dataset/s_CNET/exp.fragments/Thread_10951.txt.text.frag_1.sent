i would like to find out if the usb ports on my toshiba satellite 5205-s503 can power a portable storage device such as the lacie porche mobile hard drive (80 gb 5400 rpm). 
i looked in devices & found only the manufacturer (nec) & the driver version (5.1.2600). 
i'm it is us. 
b 2.0. 
short of calling the manufacturer how do i find out? 
thank-you
