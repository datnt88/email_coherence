yes, the bios is current. 
as you know windows 2000 pro needs sp3 to be installed to access the remainder of the 23gb's. 
i knew that and was going to download sp3 as my version already has sp2 on it. is there any other reason the software won't recognize the hd's. 
i hope i haven't killed my hard drives. 
i don't think so... but. 
i assume that the 2000 pro install cd is an oem version as the os was already installed when we got that new computer. 
it was hit by lightening hard. 
i work in a radio station with towers close by and we get our share of lightening and electrical static a lot. 
all our computers are protected as much as they can be with upc's. 
i look after 5 dos computers, 1 windows 3.1, 2 windows 98, 5 windows 2000 pro and 3 windows xp. why do i do it. 
we're a very small company with about 12 -14 employees that want to get paid. 
so we have to keep costs low. 
didn't mean to get carried away. 
thanks for your help it is appreciated. 
thank you!
