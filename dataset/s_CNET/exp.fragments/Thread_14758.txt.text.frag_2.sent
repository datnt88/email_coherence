there are so many things to check here i'm not sure where to start. 
of course you could have bad memory but i doubt it as you only seem to have the problem with the asus card installed. 
my guess is that you have something set wrong in the bios. 
check to see if your first init device is agp. 
aslo look to see that the appature setting is right for your video card. the fact that your computer will run for a few minutes before rebooting sounds a lot like a heat issue. 
some systems will reboot or shut down when there is an overheat problem and you can get that problem from running a video card at the wrong settings. 
as always be sure you have the latest drivers for the asus card and check your mainboard manufacturers website to see if there are any known issues between your board and the asus video card. 
there are several other things to check but i'm short on time and i want to see what you find out before i go further.
