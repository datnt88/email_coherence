don't know if u want to shop around but the mad dog 3.5 enclosure w/ the usb and firewire connection has been good to me for about 6 mo. 
now, with no signs of wear. 
no real heat buildup to speak of, provided your just using it to back up files ect..no fan in it either though, but for the price, $42.00 where i got it,it has been a trooper. 
nice and quiet also,and pretty shock resistent (i've move or kicked it at least 4-5 times).hope 
this helps.
