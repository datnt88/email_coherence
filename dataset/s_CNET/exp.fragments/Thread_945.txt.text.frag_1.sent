i am thinking of changing my normal 17&quot; lcd monitor to a wide screen lcd. 
however, i am concerned about distortion of images, e.g. a spherical shape will be &quot;falttened&quot; at the top and borrom ? 
people becomes &quot;fatter&quot;... will there be problems with photo editing, e.g. photoshop ? 
comments, please. 
thanks.
