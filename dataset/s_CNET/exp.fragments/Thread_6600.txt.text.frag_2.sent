i'm going with no. that's just one link in the quality chain. 
your choice on the encoding but given the usual headphones and speakers i can't tell the difference from lossless to hi-rate mp3. 
maybe you don't have to do much other than re-test your encoding method? the only assurance of such quality is when you think it's quality meets your standard. 
hdmi by itself is not enough.
