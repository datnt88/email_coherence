i just installed a simple wireless network using: 1) netgear rangemax router (wpn824) connected to toshiba cable modem. 
2) pc#1 - dell dimension 4300, win xp home edition sp2, windows firewall disabled, ezarmor firewall on with network identified for sharing, specific folder identified, connected to router via ethernet cable. 
3) pc#2 - dell dimension 3000, win xp home edition (not sure of sp#), windows firewall exceptions set to allow sharing, specific folder identified, connected via netgear rangemax wireless pci adapter (wpn311) i updated the security settings on the router to use wpa encryption & mac addresses. 
added mac address of pc#2 to list - did not add pc#1 because it did not come up as connected (that's how i entered mac address for pc#2 - the router config site identified who was connected at the time i updated the security). 
pc#1 - internet works. 
network places only shows shared folders from pc#1 itself. 
workgroup computers shows both pc#1 & pc#2, but pc#2 gives error when i try to open/explore (... not accessible. 
you may not have permission to access this network resource ... path not found.) pc#2 - internet works. 
wireless signal say 'excellent.' network places shows nothing. 
workgroup computers shows nothing. 
any thoughts on why pc#1 cannot get into pc#2? 
...why pc#2 does not see either computer (not even itself) under the workgroup or network places?
