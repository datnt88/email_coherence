i finally have a network. 
when i clik on &quot;view workgroup computers&quot; i see the computer i am networked to. 
when i clik on the computer though, i get an error message: this computer is not accessible. 
please contact the server administrator to see if you have permission to access this computer. 
i set absolutely zero security. 
could it be those pesky firewalls?
