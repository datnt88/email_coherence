when i push the power button fans barely move and then nothing. 
i have tested the power supply with volt meter and all have proper voltage. 
i even changed out power supply with a spare same problem. 
i then started disconecting power plugs and found the four pin 12 volt plug on the mother board is the problem. 
with the 4 pin plug disconected the computer will try to power up. 
i am then thinking mother board or processor. 
i took the processor out and computer now trys to power up with the 4 pin connected. 
i ordered a used processor on ebay put it in and the same problem. 
the computer is 5 years old and i don't want to spend the money on a mother board if i am off base. 
any advice would be appreciated. 
thank you.
