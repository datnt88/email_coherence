sadly, with as much information as supplied in your post i can't see where there may be an issue. 
it could be your os isn't fully installed with current patches or current drivers from each maker's web site. 
a bios could be out of date too. 
or some pest is on the machine causing problems. 
read again, this reply is no answer since the first post has so little information.
