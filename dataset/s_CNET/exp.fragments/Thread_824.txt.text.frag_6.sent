today we use 80 conductor ide cables (see google.com about that) and both drives are jumped to cable select. 
even a 2000 era pc should have that cable and use those jumper settings. 
the cdrom is never a cdrom driver issue. 
when you install the motherboard drivers, the cdrom works. 
same for usb. 
which leaves the soundblaster. 
google is your friend here. the soundblaster drivers are a bit too easy to find.
