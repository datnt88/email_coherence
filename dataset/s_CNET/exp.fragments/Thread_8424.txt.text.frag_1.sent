does anybody know anything about fujitsu computers? 
they are a big company over here in japan but i am not sure if they sell their computers back in the the u.s., or maybe they do but under a different name. 
anyway, my current computer is over 5 years old and is pretty much shot. 
instead of trying to have it fixed and upgrade all the old components it would probably be better to just buy a new one. 
i saw the following fujitsu desktop in a computer store near my home as was just wondering if anybody thinks it's any good. 
i tried looking for a computer with similiar stuff on the cnet product reviews site but had no luck. 
so, i am going to try and include as much information as possible in this post and see what people think. 
i apologize in advance for the length. 
model: fujitsu fmv deskpower fmv ce50h7 cpu: amd athlon xp 2800+ cache memory: 256mb (primary); 512mb(secondary) chipset: sis company sis741lv chipset system bus: 333 mhz main memory: standard: 256mb (ddr sdram-dimm, pc3200) slots: 2 open slots upper limit memory: 1 gb monitor: 17&quot; digital lcd (full color 167,700,000 colors) video memory: 32 mb graphics accelerator: sis company sis741lv fdd: optional hdd: 160gb (ultra ata/100, 7200turns/sec) dvd drive: super multi drive (dvd-ram: read 3x/write 3x; dvd-r: read 8x/write 8x; dvd-rw: read 8x/write 4x; dvd+r: read 8x/write 8x; dvd+rw: read 8x/write 4x; dvd-rom: read 12x; cd: read 32x; cd-r: write 24x; cd-rw: write 10x) audio function: internal chipset + ac97 codec speakers: internal (inside monitor) modem: 56kbps (v.90 standard) 100base-tx/10base-t tv capability: yes it also has 2 slots for pc cards, 1 for sd cards, 6 usb ports, input for s-video or for three color vcr input cables, digital audio input and other stuff. 
can record upto 140 hours of tv programs directly onto the dvd-ram. 
price is 160,000 yen ($1300-$1400?) even though the there a few things that probably could be better (ie: (1) the primary cache is only 256, (2) the cpu is not pentium 4 (3) the graphics card seems to be an intergrated one (4) the systems bus is not 400mhz or above) is this a good deal or should i keep looking?
