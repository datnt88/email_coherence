thank you for all of your responses! 
yes, i did pay $90.00 for the diagnostic but i may hound verizon for a refund of the money because i feel there was noting wrong w/ my pc in the first place. 
just to clarify: i have a westell versalink model 327w that verizon provided as a part of the service. 
it has four ports in the back where i have attempted to run both the pc and laptop ethernet cables. 
as explained my wifes laptop runs like a dream but all attempts to set up my pc have failed. 
my emachine is a c1641 and i again tried to connect to the internet yesterday but the network connection would connect and then disconnect stating the network cable is unplugged. 
looks like i'll take the advice of the posters and get a broadband router or four port wire router. 
thanks again!
