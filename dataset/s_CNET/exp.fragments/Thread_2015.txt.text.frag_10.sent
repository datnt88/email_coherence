i think i could fit upgrading to a slightly bigger psu and a new video card such as the gtx560 into my budget but then will i have to upgrade the cooling in my computer? 
i just have the stock fans in there but as of now it stays very cool. 
also wondering if there is a limit on power supply wattage on the motherboard. 
thanks guys for the help by the way.
