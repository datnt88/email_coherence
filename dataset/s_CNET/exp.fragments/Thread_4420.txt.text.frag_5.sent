i kind of feel the i3 would be the &quot;minimum&quot; processor and i'm afraid it would be obsolete too quickly... thus the reason i was thinking of the i5 or i7. no, i will not be doing dna sequencing work (lol), but i know new programs coming on the market gobble up space and may overtax a minimum system. 
but thank you!
