i never had to touch my wifi router to add my 360. 
but i did have to add a wifi client or wifi &quot;bridge&quot; to my 360 and configure that. 
for the official xbox 360 wifi thing there are screens on the 360 you go to, to set the wifi network you want to use, etc. i don't duplicate web content on that but here's a page about the official wifi thing -&gt; here's a video about setting that up -&gt; bob
