i transferred a 2.44 gig file from my main box to both a usb 2 and an esata external. 
the esata transfer took about 21.5 seconds and the usb 2 was about a minute and a half. 
your 3.8 gig file is roughly 1/2 again as large as the one i used so my transfer of your file on my system would be roughly 33 seconds to the esata and 2 1/2 minutes to the usb2.
