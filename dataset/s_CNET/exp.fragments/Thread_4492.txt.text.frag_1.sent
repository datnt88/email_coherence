hi, i bought all the parts to build a new pc, including the antec hcp 750 watt, the palit 2gb gtx 670 gfx and the asus maximus v gene motherboard. 
whenever i played games, asus anti-surge would trigger. 
after checking that everything was in place properly and reading through all the manuals again, a technician looked at my pc and found the psu to be faulty. the retailer replaced it, but then after fitting it, my pc would show no video output. 
i used an old nvidia 9600 gt, and it worked. the technician came back and said that the psu hnd damaged the gtx 670; the retailer then refunded me. 
i bought the palit 2gb gtx 670 jetstream this time, and when i fitted it in the top slot (16x), there was no video output. 
it did, however work in the bottom one (8x), even though in the manual it says it needs 16x. 
when i launched a game and loaded a level, it cut off saying that asus anti-surge was triggered. 
when the technician disabled the anti-surge, the psu cut out! 
i tried an old corsair vx450w and it worked without cutting off. the technician thinks it's another faulty psu, but do you have any idea what the issue is? 
i've ordered the corsair ax750 watt to see if it will work and asked for a refund for the antec hcp 750 watt. 
each time he came, the technician tested the voltage on the psu and graphics card, which appeared normal. 
temperatures and fans speeds were also normal, and appeared normal in ai suite ii and the bios too. 
updating the bios had no effect; all windows and hardware drivers are up to date. 
do you think this issue might happen again and is there any risk to my parts and do you have any idea what the issue is? 
also, why won't the graphics card work in the top slot?
