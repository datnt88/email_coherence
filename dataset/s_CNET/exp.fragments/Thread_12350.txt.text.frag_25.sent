forgive me if i'm missing something here but back up are only good if you can access them.i 
bought a 1g flash drive and stored all my pictures there since 2001. 
next, i made a dvd of pictures and movies with my hp dvd writer and placd it in a security box. 
because i'm overprotective, i went to kodak gallery and sent all pics there,too. 
so, if my hard drive or external poops out, i can secure them safely. 
the reason i made advd , too, was if the flash drive was lost or burned out.included are pics of my valuables and scans of important documents.
