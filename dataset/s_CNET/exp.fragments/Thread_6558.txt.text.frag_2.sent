if you followed the news, you knew the wep, mac address filters were ineffective and that hiding the network name or ssid only caused pain to you and your network. 
now with this news the question changes to if you really need to change from wpa. 
my thought is the answer is &quot;depends.&quot; read the articles carefully and you discover that they can only crack wpa if the password is in the dictionary. 
your better passwords with leading and trailing numbers appear to fail to be cracked. 
-&gt; the winners this round appear to be those that collect the 17 to 34 dollar fee. 
this forum's sticky and advice here still looks good. 
remember that some can't make the leap to wpa2 yet. 
if your wifi is on wpa2 today and all is well you can take a nap for another year and check monthly for any news.
