i only have the cables that came with the mobo. 
i bought a bare drive, so it didn't come with any cables. 
when i was building the computer, i did think that the quality of the cable ends looked kinda &quot;chintzy&quot;. 
so, you're probably right...the move just simply loosened the cable. 
at least, i hope that's so. 
ha. thanks.
