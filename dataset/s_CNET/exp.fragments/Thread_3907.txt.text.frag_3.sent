or some proprietary model of at&t's for business users. the switch is probably a linksys. 
but, seeing as how the office in question needs to be able to support multiple wireless clients, i think i may have to take the internal servers offline and remove the switch. 
from what i gathered, the office has 5 static ip addresses or so, and each computer keeps the same one. 
the thing is, none of the desktops need a static ip, and they no longer need any external connections to the internet for remote desktop and the like. 
plus, i could easily manage ports through the router firewall for that if need be. 
printer access is a must for all users. 
taking out the dated servers and the switch may allow me to reconfigure the network as a standard, consumer type of access point, but if i can get around it, it's worth a shot. 
not sure what else i can do.
