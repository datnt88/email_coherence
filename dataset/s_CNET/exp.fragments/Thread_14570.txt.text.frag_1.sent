i have a 320gb 7200rpm sata-hdd already running off sata port #1 on my mobo, and my dvd/cdrw running off of the single ide channel. 
i have a 40gb 5300rpm ide-hdd lying around and i was thinking of running it on the ide port as master with the dvd as slave. the plan is, i was going to just use the 40gb drive for storage only , just for keeping stuff that sits on the faster drive taking up space (documents, images, etc). 
i've seen comments on a few other forums that if i do this, it could cause problems for normal operation, even though it's on the ide channel instead of the sata where the 'main' drive is. 
i realize that there would be problems if i'm using the dvd and the ide-drive simultaneously, but i doubt that the situation would arise very often, if ever. the way that i envision it, the sata and ide are separate channels, and that there would be no conflict between the two of them. 
however, i may be wrong. 
any thoughts? 
cheers!
