i haven't had any problems playing various kinds of online videos in a while now. are you sure you were doing this recently? 
as for chatting, yes, things could be much improved there, but apple does support chatting with pc users because ichat users can video chat with anyone using the latest version of aim. 
yahoo messenger also works, but with no sound. 
there are other options, but those are the ones i'm familiar with. 
anyway, back on topic, i'd certainly wait to get a new intel machine if i was in the market for one. the macbook and the new imac are very impressive and things will only get better. 
however, the power macs (i wonder what they'll be called now, because the word power will certainly be dumped) will probably be the last to switch, because the change was mainly due to the fact that they couldn't figure out how to put g5s into laptops. the ibooks and the mini will probably be next in line for the intels, due to their small form factor. also, as a virtualpc user, i find the possible ability to boot into either os very intriguing! 
it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out.
