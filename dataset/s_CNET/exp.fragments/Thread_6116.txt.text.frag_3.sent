hello, after taking a look at those discussions, none of them match my problem. 
i dont think my problem is actually a &quot;problem&quot; with the computer, just the fact that flash does not know which screen to play the video on, it knows just to play it on the first screen. 
is there an option to set flash 9 to put fullscreen video on 2nd monitor, or a hack to do that?
