panther disk released from captivity. 
holding down the 'option' key brings up a blue screen with the choices of a reversed arrow, and a 'continue' straight arrow button. 
neither would 'fire' a response. 
in the meantime i found a g3 'boot from 'c' install disk', may not have been the correct one, but it started and disk utility gave the hd a clean bill of health. 
i also found the manner to do the aht from the burned disk i'd made from an apple download. 
it ran three times, clearing all, mass storage, ram, and logic board. 
either of these tests could be wrong of course. 
i also tried zapping the 'pram'. 
but i'm determined, is there a next step? 
thanks much for your help.
