i too found out that the majority of intel and ati adapters don't support non-standard modes. 
intel has some technical googly list.cnet.remains 
more_fragments more_threads pre_process.sh 
s.cnet.dev 
s.cnet.test 
s.cnet.train 
scripts threads on their site about issues with hardware/firmware/software compatibility and offers a non-standard driver which won't install on most laptops, including centrino platforms! 
why can't intel and ati make video products with simple user customizable driver modes like nvidia's? 
i didn't return my 1680x1050 22&quot;. 
i just dumped intel and ati and switched to nvidia.
