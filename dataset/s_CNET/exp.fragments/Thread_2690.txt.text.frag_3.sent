most video card reviews show that card or its close cousin(series) as very good. 
your new game will certainly be better for it. is it worth the money, well i never spent that much for a video card as i'm a &quot;trailing edge&quot; sorta user not a bleeding edge and wait for costs to be more reasonable. 
you can check the for a review and/or check pricelists for comments made by buyers. 
good luck -----willy
