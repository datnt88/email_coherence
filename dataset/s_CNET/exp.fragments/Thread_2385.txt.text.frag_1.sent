why don't i have sound in my rear two speakers when i play mp3's? 
all appears to work well other wise. the test on the audigy control panel works. 
the voice says: &quot;front left. 
front right. 
rear right. 
rear left.&quot; the setting is correct on the panel: 4/4.1 speakers. 
i get sound in the rear speakers during video games. 
birds chirping, guns, etc... i used two different players wmp and music match just to see if the problem was with the player, but neither let the rear speakers work. 
i sometimes swap cards with an old game theater xp and that card plays sound out the back with mp3's. 
anyone have an idea why i have no sound in my rear speakers when i play mp3's using my sb audigy 2 zs?
