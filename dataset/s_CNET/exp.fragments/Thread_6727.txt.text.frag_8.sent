i went into a local electronics store and tried to type on the macbook keyboard. 
it wasn't pretty. 
my hands are too large. the mb pro keyboard looks identical but i had a much better experience typing on it, fewer errors and overall just a better feel. 
before you decide on which computer to buy you should go to the store and demo all of them. 
good luck!
