it went pretty smoothly. 
all you need is a screwdriver, something to label the connections with and 45 minutes... actually, probably less if you're just replacing the psu. 
i added a little ram, and you have to take the drive bay out to access the slots... i'm happy with the way it's runnin, but after all this hands-on, i'm just about ready to give this pc to my wife so i can build my own!
