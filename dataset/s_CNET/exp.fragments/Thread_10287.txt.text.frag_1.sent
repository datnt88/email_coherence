i need to get an external hard drive (my 3rd). the first 2 were from owc, and incorporated a hitachi drive mechanism. 
but now i see that owc has switched to using seagage barracuda (probably for price reasons). 
the hitachi is truly high-end, and super-reliable. 
but what about seagate barracuda? 
opinions?
