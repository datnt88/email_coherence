the asus p4p400-dlx(865 chipset) can support such, but be sure that your current ddram is of the right speed and pairs for dual channel operation or you'll likely get &quot;not much&quot; of a boost. 
also, the power supply has to have spare watts to make it all stable and you'll get a new cpu heatsink/fan. 
and finally the case has to let all the heat out.
