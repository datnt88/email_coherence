make sure you are logging on using a password and that both pcs are set up this way...same user....same password. 
make sure the windows firewall, if enabled, has the &quot;file and print sharing&quot; and the &quot;local area connection settings&quot; checked in the exceptions and advanced sections. 
do you have any other firewalls installed by any chance? 
these can be a factor as well. 
it is possible to set up permissions manually while logged in as an adminstrator in safe mode if that becomes necessary but it usually is not.
