go to device manager and remove all usb ports, root hubs, etc. reboot and see if windows redetects them. 
if it does, the drivers should be automatically reinstalled. 
now, you did not mention whether these usb ports were on an add in card or on the mb. if on the mb, you will have some fixed to the rear edge and maybe some cabled to the front. 
front ports which are plugged in and not fixed to the mb can have the connectors come loose. 
hope this gives a starting point.
