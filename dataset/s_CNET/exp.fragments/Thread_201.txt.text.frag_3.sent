maybe you should do the setup without it?&gt;&gt;&gt; which setup are you talking about...xp wizard or the magic network software? 
i've reinstalled the software so many times even their techs are confused...which is not saying much these days. 
obviously, you don't mean the xp wizard...how else can one setup a network..jeesh!
