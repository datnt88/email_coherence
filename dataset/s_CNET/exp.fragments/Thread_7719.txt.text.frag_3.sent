that is the problem. 
there is no contact info. the manual just says &quot;contact your sales reprsentative&quot; another statement it makes is &quot;some computers may need special ups monitoring software. 
contact your dealer for details on the various interface kits&quot;. 
i bought this new from a discount store and was wondering if anyone here had any knowledge on this model of ups. 
i have see quite a few on sale. 
power sentry 2200va with an rs-232 interface. 
thanks mtree
