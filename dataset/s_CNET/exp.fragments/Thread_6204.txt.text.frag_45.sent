i have been impressed with the new nas that pogo plug is offering. 
i had a couple of old 200 gigabyte hard drives and bought 2 hard drive enclosures and hooked them up to my pp. myself and others that i give permission to can access any files, music, videos or &quot;junk&quot; that i designate. 
it's easy to set up and maintain. 
you can also use it to back up everything on your computers. 
since it is your own personal cloud there are no maintenance fees or anything else associated with it that cost money. 
i have it all protected by my norton 360 so it is encrypted and safe. 
i even check on and add to shared files we are working on through my thunderbolt android phone. 
i love my pogo plug for just this type of work!
