the 680i line has been very problematic and has had data corruption issues. 
this 750i would be a better choice if sli is a must: the 8800gts/640mb has been obsolete since late last year. 
the 9600gt/512mb and the 8800gt/512mb are faster and cheaper ($130-$170). the 9800gtx/512mb is dropping to $200 in the next few days. 
and the radeon hd 4850 and hd 4870 are generally considered the best choices at $200 and $305. 
if you won't be using dual cards, then a p45 based mobo would be a better choice than the 750i. 
if you want dual gpus then drop in a 9800gx2.
