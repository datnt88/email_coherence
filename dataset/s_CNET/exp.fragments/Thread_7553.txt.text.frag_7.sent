i can see your point about backups. 
i will be keeping all the original media. 
that could be considered a form of backup(with one really nasty restore path). 
a quick search just got me a ball park price of $1100 for a quantum dlt drive , 1.5 tb of media and a scsi controller. 
that's almost what i figured the first tb of raid would cost me. 
this is for home use so i may take my chances for a while. 
in all likelyhood until, as you say, i have suffered enough. 
everyone seems to be trying to talk me out of a raid. is there something intrinsically bad about raid arrays? 
my original question was what is the advantage of going to a sata raid as opposed to an ide raid. 
dose anyone have any input on that?
