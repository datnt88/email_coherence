hmm.. then i shouldn't have an issue with it then at all. 
but the difference between the xeon x3370 and the core2 q9650 are not very different at all. 
so in benchmarks for handling 3d applications like maya must be talking about the more workstation xeons for server boards that hardcore 3d animators use for their renderfarms. 
thanks again, i think i may consider the q9650 over the xeon, the only difference is the microcode and l1 and l2 cache speeds. 
other than that i believe they are the same.
