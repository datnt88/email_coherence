1. usbman noted an intel download for xp! &quot;inf update utility [infinst.exe] 
(1428kb) 5.1.1.1002 12/12/2003 download this utility installs inf files that inform the operating system how to properly configure the chipset for specific functionality such as usb and agp.&quot; that's december 12, 2003. 
very fresh stuff you won't have on your xp cd. just 4 clicks from this google -&gt; i land at 2. while that's very interesting to me about the motherboard drivers are still being updated by intel, the other issue is that scanner's drivers and applications. 
shows a drivers link, but a note read &quot;technical support tip: it is important to properly remove any previous versions before installing this driver.&quot; 
i don't remember you doing this step. 
remember never plug in any usb before the instructions tell you. the results are long discussions... bob
