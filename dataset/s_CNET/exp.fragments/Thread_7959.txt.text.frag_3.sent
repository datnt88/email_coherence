this monitor does not have + and - buttons. 
there is only a &quot;down carat&quot; and no up. 
so once the brightness is turned down (following the manual), if i want to turn it back up, it isn't possible. 
or so the samsung support agent said. 
i find it incomprehensible that there would be a setting that can be lowered but not raised. 
if nothing else, at least re-flash the eeprom to its original full-on setting. 
i have always liked samsung products, and own quite a few. 
this has me really reconsidering.
