every morning i have this trouble turning on my pc. i turn on my avr, then push the power button on cpu case. 
what happened, the power led only blink and the pc don't open/power on. 
the first time this happen, i opened my case and look for the suspected culprit. 
i detached my psu and have it check by qualified technician to see if it is bad or damaged. 
it wasn't (use tester, it's good; did some switching on pins and got no problem!). so i put back psu, and for other suspected culprit, this time: check the wires connecting my sw to power button. 
i pull and replugged the pins/connector thinking it just need some &quot;refreshing&quot; and it will be good again. 
then, i turn on my pc again pushing the power button on the case. 
it start my pc! but the next morning, the same fate happened. 
i've gone again to the same ordeal, repeating what i did the past day... and these have been my practice every morning since then.. until, i got tired of doing it over and over again. 
so, while my avr is turn on i just let it sit there (perhaps 3-5 minutes) and out of disgust i pushed on the power and my pc start again! 
so every morning, i let my avr turn on for several minutes (5 minutes) or even more before pushing my power button. 
sometimes, successful sometimes not. 
i also observed that during cool temperature (e.g when rain down poured the past night) i have this problem, but not on a hot temperature (e.g. no rain the past night). 
i don't know what's exactly the culprit. 
please help me on this. 
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
