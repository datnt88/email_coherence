thanks for responding. 
finally someone who knows what they're talking about yup tried multiple devices. 
pcs, blackberries, iphones, laptops. the router is out of warranty so i can hack at it all i like. 
there's no jtag port unfortunately. the antenna is a caltronics internal antenna, connected directly to the pcb. 
there doesn't appear to be any break in the circuitry between it and the radio.
