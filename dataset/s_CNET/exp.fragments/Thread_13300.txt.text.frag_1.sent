hello, everyone. 
i just bought a new monitor for my computer and i would also like to upgrade the graphics card. 
i have a dell dimension 9150 with the stock geforce 7300le graphics card, i have 4 gigs of ram. 
i've gone from a dell 19 in monitor to a dell st2410 and would like to get your input on what card would be a good replacement for the geforce. 
as i'am sure you can see by this, this is not a gaming computer. 
thank you all in advance.
