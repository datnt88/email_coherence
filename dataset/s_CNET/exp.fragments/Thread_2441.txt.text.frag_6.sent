thanks for the replys all, unfortunately, i just found out that the upstairs neighbor's router is also his modem, so there is no switching them. 
so the set up will be my netgear n rated router/ap wired by cat6 cable from his westell g rated modem/router. 
that will act as my hub for wired and wireless connections. 
i'm having some trouble configuring the netgear to do anything it's supposed to. 
i turn off dhcp, and try to give it a subnet ip in the range of the westell but then i just lose connection to the netgear. 
i can't login to it with any ip. i'll try to figure it out for a few more days though, before i ask for help. 
thanks!
