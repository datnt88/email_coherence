i never gave a name to the downstairs default account, just accepted the default, which was, i think, &quot;user&quot;. 
anyway, i have changed its name to be the same as the one on this machine. 
it didn't make any difference. 
would just changing the name have been sufficient? 
i have now un-shared the printer, and then shared it again. 
going downstairs to see if anything has changed ....
