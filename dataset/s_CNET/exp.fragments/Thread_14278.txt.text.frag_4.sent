i've lost count how many times. 
sorry if that was a bother but i have to do that. 
look for any reset. 
also, research bad caps on google. 
yes, these are afflicting displays and too many other electronic gear. 
in short: 1. resets. 
2. bad caps. 
3. bad solder work. 
hope this gives you some ideas.
