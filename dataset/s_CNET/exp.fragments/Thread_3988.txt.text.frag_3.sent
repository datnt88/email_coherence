hd pc gaming is reallllllly new. 
only a handful of video cards can run hd, and i havent kept up but i dont know of any pc games that run hd (im probably wrong though). 
hd gaming is mainly in the realm of xbox 360 and the ps3. 
as for hl2. 
its kind of old and the graphics arent bleeding edge any more. 
even fear is lagging behind but its still a system hog. 
hl2 is one of the most optimized games iv come across therefore it isnt all that demanding. 
if i were you i would def do some upgrading if you have the money. 
online play is usually more demanding so if you plan on getting into that it would be a good idea to upgrade to something that can get the job done a little better
