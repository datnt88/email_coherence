x38 based mobos should be out around sept 23rd. 
it brings pci-express 2.0 and some memory latency improvements. 
initially most x38s will be ddr3 only but some manufacturers are planning ddr2 versions. 
almost all will have at least 2 pci-e x16 slots. 
performance-wise, the x38 should be a bit (3-5%) faster than a stock p35, but a well tuned p35 will close the gap. 
since you're choosing mid-high range components a p35 mobo should be sufficient. 
why spend $240 on a mobo and then put a $280 cpu in it? the x38 is intended for ultra-high end performance and components.
