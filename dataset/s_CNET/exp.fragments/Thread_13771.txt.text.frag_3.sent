a cd drive is about what you need to get. its going to make reloading the os that much better and you'll need it anyways over time. the cost of a new cd drive is pretty cheap. 
if you can't do that a &quot;borrowed&quot; drive will do fine provided you have no cd issues. 
i have found used cd drives at the goodwill and sal. 
army outlets, just be sure you get a later model. 
you can contact or get the &quot;floppy version for xp&quot; if still available to load that way, but this is a very drawn out process. 
goto ms support and get the info about xp floppy install, but since you have hp or a provided oem version of xp(i suspect), its an open question. 
contact hp for any possible xp os disks to load, but again for a small cost if still provided. 
xp is in itself an os overshadowed by the vista os and hp may no longer provide certain support.
