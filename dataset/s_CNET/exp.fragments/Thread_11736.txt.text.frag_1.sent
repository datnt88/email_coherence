hello, i would like to buy a dell ultrasharp 1905fp 19&quot; tft monitor, but unfortunately my video card is an old nvidia geforce2 mx 400 which doesn't have a dvi connector. 
has anyone tested these two together? 
how is the image and text quality like when the monitor is connected via the analog input? 
thanks, vasile
