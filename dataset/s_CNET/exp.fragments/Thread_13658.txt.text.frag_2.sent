i have seen windows install an generic driver for hard disk controllers that does not recognize large hd's. 
download the latest driver for your hd controller from your website and install it. 
if this is a homebuilt machine, download the driver from the motherboard mfg. 
if the controller is a pci add-in card, download the driver from the card's website. the description of the driver should say something to the effect that it supports large hard disks or 48-bit lba. 
for troubleshooting in this forum please provide the following: - computer make & model - does the drive data cable connect directly to the motherboard or to a pci card? 
- if a pci card, what is the name of the card? 
(look in device manager under scsi & raid controllers.)
