just checked my sons hp computer that i know is 10/100 and it too shows gigabit in the device manager. 
i can go into control panel-network-show status and it shows 100. 
i can do the same on my dell that i know is gigabit all the way through and it shows 1.0gbps. 
as i said on my previous post, pci 10/100/1000 nic cards are pretty cheap and are almost plug and play. 
i would definitely go that route because you will know everything is gigabit and no gray areas. 
i believe i paid $22.00 or $23.00 for the last one i bought at staples. 
you can actually get them cheaper online, but have to worry about the shipping cost as well as the time.
