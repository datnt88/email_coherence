i am planning to build a computer with hp in the next few days, but, i'm working on figuring out what i want to build. 
originally i was looking at the hp pavilion a1550y and completely over looked that it is a pentium d 915 processor. 
having thought it was intel dual core this whole time, it is a little dissapointing. 
now, the way i understand it is that intel dual core is the newest and best available. 
intel pentium d is also dual core, but not as new and fast, is this true or am i wrong. 
i like this particular computer because it was dual core (or so i thought) 2.8ghz. 
the other computer i have been looking at is the dv4600y. 
it offers intel core 2 duo, but at 2.4ghz rather than 2.8. the other thing is that it only allows you to get a dvd burner with lightscribe, which i really have know need or use for and would end up being more a problem and costly than what i need. 
so, is my thinking correct on this? and if so, do you have any suggestions for what i should look into now? 
again, i prefer to stick with hp and compaq and i'm leaning toward hp. thanks
