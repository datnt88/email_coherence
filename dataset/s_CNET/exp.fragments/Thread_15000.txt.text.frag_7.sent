i made a typo above. 
i meant to write &quot;it does not mean the sticks are bad.&quot; what a difference when i drop one word. 
that extra info helps a little but only in that i would try it with one stick at a time and move it from slot to slot till it boots. 
with 512mb and 11mb given up for the onboard video this should boot slowly. 
i see nothing wrong with such as low memory machine running vista to run incredibly slow.
