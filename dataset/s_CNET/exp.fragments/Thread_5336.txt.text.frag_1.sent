i bought a new computer yesterday, and thus had to buy a video capture card (ati wonder 650) that is compatible with vista. 
i have a $300 outdoor security camera that i plug into the capture cards composite input and have a program i bought that records upon motion detection, and can stream video to a web site (active webcam is the program). 
everything works fine until i use the tv tuner on the same card. 
the cam image then changes to the tv chanel i am watching. 
but if i close the cam program and open it again, it changes the tv tuner channel to display the cam feed. 
so i can only view one or the other. 
this never happened before. 
i don't know what to do. 
i think it is to do with the way the card sends video to the programs. 
in the webcam software, it is using direct show, the video device is set to &quot;ati avstream anolog capture&quot; and the video source is &quot;composite 1&quot; (from the availible option of tv tuner, composite 1, and s-video [the three inputs from the card]). 
any ideas?
