same problem i think anyway win xp my printer when doing a page will go to 99% then stop there...the paper comes out and the job is done but it still won't go to the next printing job...it gives you the option of &quot;cancelling&quot; the current job but even that doesn't help...it still won't move to the next thing i then get a list of &quot;pending&quot; jobs it has to do but unless i reboot...it won't go to the next printing task are all our problems related? 
btw i have a lexmark x1150 and everything else(scanning...faxing etc) all still work fine just printing is acting up
