given the intel family of processors for desktops, which processor is the highest performer (more on this)? 
in advance pls forgive any confusion on my part i am new to the processor arena. 
- extreme processors - core 2 quad e - core 2 quad qx (is this extreme proc?) - penryn (which one is this?) - xe processors (such a thing?) - xeon - itanium also if you're going to get high end wouldn't it make more sense to pair them with ddr3 instead of ddr2? 
finally what is meant by &quot;better&quot;? 
more fp ops per sec, best rendering, faster fetch perform cycle? 
what is the yardstick? 
i know some basic things such as quad will beat a dual anyday. 
45nm technology is superior (faster, cooler) than 65nm. 
help!
