i have a win2000 and win98 pc connected via netgear router. 
i also connect to work network (from win2000 pc) via vpn. 
it seems that i can only access the win98 pc (from win2000 pc) once i have made the vpn connection to work. 
otherwise , no go. 
and even after disconnecting from vpn , i can still access the win98. 
tia for any suggestions allowing me to skip the vpn step.
