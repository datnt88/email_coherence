hi jawot, i work for hp and saw your post and want to help if i can. 
can you tell me more about your issue. 
did this start out of no where, like you just woke up one morning and it wasn't working? 
did it happen after running a software update, such as a bios update? 
does anything at all show up on your monitor, does your monitor detect if your pc is connected? 
it's kind of hard to tell, but maybe you had a failed bios update, or perhaps some hardware has failed, such as the motherboard or power supply. 
here are some boot and power troubleshooting documents from hp for your pc model: if it turns out this is from a failed bios update, you may need to send the pc into hp for reimaging, or you can also try taking out the cmos battery for about 30 minutes and seeing if that will reset your bios to default. 
if you want to try the cmos battery step, from the page linked above, there is also a document on replacing the cmos battery. 
for future reference, here is your hp product support page: let us know how it goes. 
--although i am an hp employee, i am speaking for myself and not for hp.--
