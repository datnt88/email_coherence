do you have a budget in mind? 
what games do you want to play? 
what settings? 
what resolution monitor? 
these factors all come into play in selecting a video card. 
for general help about upgrading, i suggest visiting this site which has lots of helpful information and links: one of its pages specifically addresses the items to consider in choosing a video card: but the other pages should be helpful too. 
if you are looking for a quick solution, check out the article at thg that lists the best video cards at different budget levels, including a brief characterization of its performance, and links to its reviews: the hd 5670 recommendation by bob b is a good choice in its budget range. 
note that he is consiedering your psu which is an effective upper limit on how powerful a card your system will handle. 
with your 375w psu, you can also handle a little more power - and more expensive card - like the gtx 560 - if your budget will handle $175: here is a review that descibes the card and provides benchmarks that will show you its performance. 
note that the page on power usage shows it - the total system - using 295w for video card based on the standard reference design and 325w when overclocked - which is about all you would want to put on a 375w psu. 
but answer the above questions and people here can provide more specific advice.
