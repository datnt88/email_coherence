i'm sure you meant gb. it's a common mistake as well as an easy typo. 
as far as the memory goes, i would recommend 3gb of ram for any vista machine. 
this way, you have plenty of breathing room for the operating system and the software. 
remember, you can always turn off some stuff in vista and reclaim some of that memory.
