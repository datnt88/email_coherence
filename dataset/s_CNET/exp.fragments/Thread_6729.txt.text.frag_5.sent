i've run my av software normally and in safe mode several times, to no avail, and i also just noticed windows media player won't open. 
i reinstalled the program itself, but no change. 
drives slowing my pc to a standstill, av software not operating as usual, programs not functioning at all...got to be a virus of some sort, but how do i get rid of it if my av software won't catch it? 
thanks!
