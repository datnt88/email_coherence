we cannot receive a fax after picking up on our 2nd line. 
our all in one is hooked up to line 2. we receive calls on line 2 when line one is busy so we need to answer line 2 in case it's an call from a client. 
but if it is a fax we have not been able to figure out how to receive the fax. 
we have emailed and called epson support but their responses have been of no help.
