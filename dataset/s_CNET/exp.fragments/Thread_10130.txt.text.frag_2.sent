&quot;i am building a computer with an asus txp4-x motherboard, which i do not know how to connect to the case.&quot; in not many words, the speaker connector goes the speaker connection, the reset connector to the reset connection and the atx power switch connector goes to the power sw connection. the led indicators are somewhat optional and if they don't light up, try rotating the connector. 
in closing, there are other extra connectors or connections. 
this might confuse a new builder.
