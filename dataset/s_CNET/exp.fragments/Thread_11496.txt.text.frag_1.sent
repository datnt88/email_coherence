ive been confused for a while. 
i want to upgrade my house with wireless. 
looking at reviews from cnet both belkin pre n and the netgear rangmax wpn824 both have excellent ratings. 
my computers have regular g cards in them, and my laptop (dell inspiron 700m) has a built in intel pro 2200 b/g card in it. 
it is the main focus for connection since its what i use most. the reason i want to go with such great range routers is that on some days of the week i need connection in an area that is 150-200 feet away. 
any help or advice would be appreciated! 
thanks, chandan
