the most famous tablet was the one cast in stone on the top of a mountain. 
it had ten commandments that were meant to be followed by all. 
it was meant to make make the world a better place. 
well before it &quot;got out of the box&quot; it's keeper moses discovered that his customers displayed needs that this simple tablet was not good enough. 
he dashed and broke it. 
now we have civil law and humans realize that it is a work in progress. 
so goes computing and networking. 
some day the tablet will evolve into a device that makes laptops look primitive. . 
i suspect cloud computing will take care of much of the functionality that is missing these days. 
it is a trade off. 
desktops have the electrical and mechanical robustness and work horse power and are easy to upgrade and repair. 
they do it all. 
they just do not travel well. 
laptops are the next best, but do not travel as well as tablets; specially 7' tablets . 
it's a work in progress
