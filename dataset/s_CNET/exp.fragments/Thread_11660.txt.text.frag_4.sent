i've tried locating the drivers and on the gateway website i have downloaded 3 networking drivers, but none have really worked. 
one did manage to turn the wireless radio on, yet the windows zero configuration (wzc) had a conflict searching for wireless networks because the broadcom driver was the one in charge of it, yet it's not searching for wireless networks, so it's just a mess. 
i need to get that broadcom driver out, and try to install the original wireless radio, but i wouldn't know under what device it would be or how to locate the driver without access to the internet.
