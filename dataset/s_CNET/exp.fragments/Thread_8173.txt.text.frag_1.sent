hey guys our company is starting a new project and our clients will be going digital with their records. 
they will have 24 ipads that their clients/customers will be using. 
my question is -- what is the best security out there (software and hardware) for the ipad. 
ie - if it is physically stolen. 
i have heard of mobileme and gadgettrak. 
does anyone know of anything better or recommend one over the other? 
our main goal is to make sure they aren't physically stolen (if they are we would like to have gps capabilities - like mobileme). the ipads will be moving around alot so they can't be stationary (no chains, wires, etc to hold it down). 
thank in advance for your help
