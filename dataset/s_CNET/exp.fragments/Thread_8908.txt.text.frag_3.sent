would i be able to use ptedit32 under windows 7? i have a feeling that the f11 option after the bios loads directly from the hidden partition. 
so removing the partition would mean removing the f11 option. 
thanks for the help. 
other comments are still welcome since i would rather not use 3rd party software to make this hidden partition visible.
