i just purchased a thermaltake soprano dx. i wanted many of the same features you mentioned. 
this seemed to be the case for me. 
not too flashy with all the lights, but subtle lighting and a sleek piano black finish. 
plenty of room for a big board and all your stuff. 
$119 at tigerdirect.com. 
i have not even used it yet. 
i'm waiting for all my components to arrive before i actually open it up and install everything. 
i know it has removable drive bays, but as for side-loading drives, i don't think so. 
my ultra 700-w power supply actually came with an included ultra grid case, which also looks very cool and has side-loading drive bays. 
i'm very tempted to use it. 
it's actually very slick, not flashy, but just refined and simple. 
all these are available at tigerdirect.com.
