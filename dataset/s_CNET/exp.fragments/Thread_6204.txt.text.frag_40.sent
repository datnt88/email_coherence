dropbox is super cool and easy to use. 
download, install, create a folder then share it with your co-worker. 
it will take 5 minutes tops. 
everything you put into the dropbox folder will show up magically in the co-workers dropbox folder, if you make a change it will magically change on the other computer, if you drag it out of the folder it will disappear from the other computer. 
if you click this next link to get your new dropbox account i will get a referral 1/4 extra gb of space from dropbox and you will get a dropbox 2gb account for free! 
never use a usb flashdrive ever again. 
if you are worried about security and encryption, use another free program called trucrypt. 
encrypt your files right in your dropbox folder. 
more info is here: if the files you share are a spreadsheet or a document, then use google docs. 
super easy to share a file, it is designed for document collaboration.
