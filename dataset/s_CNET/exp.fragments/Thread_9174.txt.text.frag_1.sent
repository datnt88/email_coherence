i had an extra parallel port put in by computer store back when i had windows 98. when i had foremat and xp installed by the same store, he neglected to downlad the driver for this new port. 
i wasn't using the port so just disabled it. 
i recently found the ite driver and downloaded and installed it. 
in device manager it shows under ports as pci parallel port on lpt3 which is correct. 
however it also created a new folded in device manager called, multi-port serial adaptors and shows as a pci multi-i/o controller. 
why is it in two places and shows differently?
