well, i planned on buying a new case, which would come with a new psu. 
i should have worded by original post better, what i meant was maybe i'd need to buy a new psu to replace the one that would come with my new case? 
like for instance, i was looking at this one: it comes with a 450w power supply, would that be good enough? 
that case only has one fan, but the processor i am buying comes with a fan and heatsink, and the video card i buy will probably have one as well, would it stay cool enough in there?
