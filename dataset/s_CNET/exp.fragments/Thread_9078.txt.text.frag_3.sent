good lookin out. 
i just bought this power supply on ebay . 
it doesnt say it has any 6 pin pci-e connection. 
i hope this will work with an 8600/8800 card or i just threw away 30 bucks. 
do i need to worry about the height or just the length is what can be a concern. 
i hope the prices go down once ati releases their dx10 cards.
