welcome to the pc world. 
it's a place where hardware and data just vanish. 
it drives people crazy...now you see it/now you don't. 
#1 rule.....backup/backup/backup. 
did you violate the rule? 
as far as i know hd's don't go click-click-click. 
so unless someone has a better thought, i would install that new hd, load windows, install the old hd as a slave and see if i could salvage any of my stuff.
