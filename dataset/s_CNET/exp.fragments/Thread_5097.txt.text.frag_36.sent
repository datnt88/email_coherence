now that i am able to record tv through cable to my computer, i'd like to kick it back to watch on my living room tv (my wife doesn't like watching on the computer monitor). 
has anyone hooked up the pc directly to their tv inputs and used it? 
i tried the other day with an s-video cable and rca cables and then turned on the tv but nothing. 
talking to hp, they told me a new video card, which i just happened to buy the other day, so that's cool. is there a specific pin setting on the s-video cable that i need? 
just curious if anyone has tried this out.
