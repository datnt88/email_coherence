i tried to connect my cisco router to back of verizon router and use it in addition as i was suggested too when i was on the phone with verizon trch support but it would not get past &quot; waiting for dhcp leash &quot; or something like that. 
but ya i will try it without the actiontex fios router at all and let u know the result. 
thanks for checking back on this even though u did not think u could help. 
you sir are most appreciated. 
thanks
