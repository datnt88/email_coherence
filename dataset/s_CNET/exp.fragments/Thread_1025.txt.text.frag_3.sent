my hp system also has 64 bit vista. the matlab program takes about an hour on this system, which seems reasonable, there's a lot of math. the cnet benchmark specs gave these 2 systems comparable performance, although the dell should be faster, all tests were done with 64 bit vista (if i remember correctly). the main difference between the hp & the dell is the processor, but that shouldn't lead to such a vast difference in performance (1 hr on the hp vs 2 hrs on the dell), should it?
