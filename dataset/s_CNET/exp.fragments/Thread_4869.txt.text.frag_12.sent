thank you once again. 
sweet. 
i am going to get the azza case. 
those ram's are for intel motherboards, so i am no longer looking at those. 
i thought about that too. 
yeah, tooless is easier, but those thumb screws are not bad either. 
so, this looks like my final build . 
i will make my final decision by the weekend for sure. 
if you or anyone else has any recomendations please let me know. 
thanks again.
