there are two factors involved. 
one will be your network speed and the other will be the usb to router transfer speed. 
this router seems to be 10/100 so even usb2 will outrun it. 
usb3 should not make any difference one way or the other. 
if your network speed was fully gigabit, it might matter in some limited circumstances. 
in any event, it should provide you with what you want short of buying an actual nas device.
