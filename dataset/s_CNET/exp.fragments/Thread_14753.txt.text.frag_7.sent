the major thrust for externals, i always thought, was that you could backup all your data and just transfer to another pc when your primary went down. 
i've lost about 5 hds in the last few years but it never slowed me down much. 
i have 5 pcs and a laptop, all with usb2. 
i have 3 externals with some data replicated on all 3, in addition to the internals. 
i lost an external a while back and decided hds, external and internal, just weren't dependable enough for critical data, unless quite redundant. 
i thought that's what raid was all about. 
if your os gets corrupted, you'll need another hd with the os on it anyhow to pull the files off ( unless you're lucky enough to get system restore to really work - mine always look like an ms patch-job, too little, too late ) i always have a formatted hd lying around to reinstall xp pro on for emergencies. 
anything short of a format seems to leave all sorts of artifacts that ms wants as evidence of your criminal activities. 
i can always be back on the air in a few hours, with access to most of my apps, although complete reinstall with the thousands of registry entries so dear to the hearts of the lower level programmers takes a full day.
