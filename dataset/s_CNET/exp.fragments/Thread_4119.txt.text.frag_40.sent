i don't know what is wrong with your video card, but there are 3 things i'd consider; 1. some windows or other update that breaks the drivers you are currently running. 
ati constantly updates the drivers for their recent cards and you may wish to try that. 
2. a new piece of hardware doesn't like your ati card. 
i've seen ethernet cards die when a sata controller is installed. 
or the same sata card barely worked when an old soundblaster card was enabled. 
3. i had an ati 7500 aiw die on me some years ago. 
it did it in stages. 
i replaced it and the replacement worked for years. 
you could just have a defective card.
