the usb memory sticks tend to stand up to drops better than external drives. 
for a lot more money you can find solid state external drives that will survive better than many external hard drives. 
the lesson here is simple. 
&quot;we only lose what we didn't backup.&quot; 
these externals are useful things but do not count as &quot;storage&quot; but as &quot;convenient copies.&quot;
