i access all my hard drives with operating system on them through bios. 
i go to advanced bios features. 
for instance my main drive is a wd 74 gig 10,000 rpm hd xp. so i have &gt; 1st boot set as scsi snd boot set as cdrom 3rd boot set as floopy and then i have it set on sata to get to my other hd xp. i just change the 1st boot to hdd and leave all the rest the same. 
to get to my hd with vista on it i change 1st boot to scsi 2nd boot to cdrom 3rd boot to floopy and put it on raid and i have one hard drive with know operating system on it for storage. the other night i unlocked all my hard drives from my main drive which has xp on it and did a through maintenance and ran avast and i deleted a trojan from my vist hard drive and i wondered if that was my problem wiht my vista hard drive. 
i was not having problems with it before.
