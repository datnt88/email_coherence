we have tried everything to get our samsung katalyst phones to work in our house which is equipped with verizon fios wi-fi. 
after - literally - hours on the land-line phone with both verizon and t-mobile, our wi-fi has never worked with these phones. 
and that's the only reason we bought them in the first place. 
gr-r-r-r-r-rrrrrrrr!!!! can anyone help?
