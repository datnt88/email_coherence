when i connected the lap top to the modem i still could not access the internet, and at the time his computer was the only computer on the network, i did try flushing the dns but it gave me a message, i will try it and write everything down and post it for ya later on. 
it doesn't seem to be if a computer connects he cannot connect, he just cannot connect at all.
