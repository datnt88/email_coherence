hi mark3316, i just purchased a compaq r3000z laptop with the built in broadcom wireless. 
i received it yesterday and have been having the same issue. 
i spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support tonight. 
we went thru all the normal things with no luck. the tech put me on hold for about 10 minutes. 
when he returned, he told me that this is a known bug with the built in broadcom wireless and windows xp sp2. 
do you have sp2 installed? 
mine came with it pre-installed. 
unfortunatly, the tech could not find the 'patch' he wanted. 
we tried one but it did not help. 
he's going to do more research and call me tomorrow around 4pm eastern us time. 
i'll post the results in case they help you.
