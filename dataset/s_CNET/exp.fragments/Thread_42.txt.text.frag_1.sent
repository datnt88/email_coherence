i am a graphic designer for a small organisation running a windows network. 
i am using a pretty old computer at the moment and they would like to update me. 
i usually use a mac, and am not sure how to go about finding an appropriate pc for my functions. 
i will generally be running photoshop, illustrator and indesign all at once as well as the other standard office applications to run email and word processing. 
does anyone have any suggestions as to what i need in a pc, monitor and or laptop.
