tomshardware did a test years ago where they keep the same system but changed the motherboards. 
result? 
less than 2 per cent in test results. 
too low to rule out variation in humans, how good the windows install was, etc. i wonder if there was more to that advice such as the person wanted sli pcie x16 slots and was burnt by such in the past because they didn't check?
