kevin, you seem to have been quite taken by mr. jobs' sales pitch. 
i'm a lifelong mac user and plan to buy again, but trusting that ''mac and intel have been working on this project, their engineering departments have ironed it out i am sure'' and that there won't be any bugs in the new intel versions is ''buying a cat in a sack'' as the danish say. 
(perhaps your son speaks danish) personally, i'm in a tough spot - my current computer, a g3 powerbook running 9.2, is on its last breaths, and i doubt i can hold out for two years while apple introduces and then gets the bugs out of the new intel versions. 
it'll also take software awhile to catch up - ie, what we can buy today won't work at its optimum level on intel. 
i'm tempted to just buy a g5 i can use now and for the next 2 or 3 years, but that means that by 2008 i could be in the same position i am now - with last-generation machine that doesn't work with the lastest software. 
i have a baby daughter who will be needing educational software within 3 or 4 years, so that's a concern. 
what's more, i live in denmark, where in addition to high income taxes we pay 20% sales tax - so buying a new mac on a regular basis becomes an even more expensive option. 
it's a real pickle - usability now or later?
