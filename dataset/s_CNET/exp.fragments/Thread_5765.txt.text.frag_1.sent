just got a my book essential 1.5 tb hd a few things i want to ask: - how exactly do i add files / folders *manually*? 
- i read online that seemed to strongly advise you do not add or use the wd smartware. 
ok. already installed & used it. 
what have i done or what's in store for me now? 
what to do from here? 
- how exactly do i double check that what *appears* to be backed up in the hd is really there? 
thanks for any help.
