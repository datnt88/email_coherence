1. who installed the pc's os? many don't install needed motherboard drivers. 
2. i can't find the discussion but we went down all the menus and checked xp's firewall and more settings to discover it was still not doing ping. the acid test was to boot up pclinuxos from cd and ping worked fine. 
so the hardware was good but no ping. 
ftp and the web worked fine so we ended there since we knew the pc's os was corrupt but they felt it was not worth a reload just to get ping working again.
