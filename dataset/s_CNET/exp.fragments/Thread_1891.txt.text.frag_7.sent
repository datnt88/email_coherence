...nope, don't have the matrix thing you're referring to. 
don't have a thx console either. 
(this is an el cheapo sound card - it's the sound blaster live! 
digital 5.1. 
got it basically for free, but it's like two seasons ago model! 
box says &quot;certified for windows 2000&quot; ha!) so, i think when the money flows, i'll look into one of the audigy's. 
by the way, how you like that audigy 2 zs? it looks like an outstanding card.
