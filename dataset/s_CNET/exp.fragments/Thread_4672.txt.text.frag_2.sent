i don't think you have a system&quot; problem based on your ability to display video on an external monitor. 
your laptop uses the same components/firmware/software to produce the video and is then directed to all the outputs on your laptop. 
ie. lcd screen and vga/dvi connection. 
i suggest you call apple in whatever country you are in and go from there.
