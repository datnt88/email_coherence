my work, works well on laptops. 
over the past decade i've moved from compaq r3000 with amd 64 2ghz single core to hp amd dv6000 x2 turion to hp dv6 core2duo to what i use today which is a dell i15r 2646mrb with intel's i5 6gb ram and more. 
each has been a nice step up. 
i knew not to go to the i7 for a laptop so i wait for the next advance before i consider anything more powerful. 
the dell was only 749 and my only quibble is the lcd is barely acceptable but for the price it's quite a deal. 
-&gt; i have this computationally intensive app i wrote that sifts through some 4 billion number sets and it completes in 10 or so minutes. 
for me, this is fast enough. 
if the i7 is out of the budget, the i5 is quite nice. 
my core2duo took about twice as long.
