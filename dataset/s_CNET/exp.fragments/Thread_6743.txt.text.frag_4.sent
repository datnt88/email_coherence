i just want to get it going for cheap. 
i plan on getting a laptop. the processor is fast enough to do what i want it to do: some graphic but mainly music and movies. 
with the existing computer i have, what would be the best video card i can put in for cheap that gets me max resolution (1920 x 1200 / 60 hz)?
