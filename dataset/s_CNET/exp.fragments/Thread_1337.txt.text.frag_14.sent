i bought my first computer in 1999, and have always used canon printers. 
within a few months, i found acsi bulk inks 1-888-728-2465. 
their website link is since most canon printers have separate tanks for each color, they are easy to fill. the price of ink is virtually the same price as when i first purchased it. 
it will depend on the inks, but the ones that i use for my canon are about 23.95 a pint.i need to mention that since 2001 we have had two printers and refill the tanks of both. 
i must tell you that i do not print photos with my printer, but have printed owner manuals, pdf documents, etc over the years, and i just checked my supply. 
of course i use more black than colors, and my last black was purchased in september 2009, and have half of that bottle left. 
i will have to order a new bottle of yellow. the last bottle of yellow was purchased in october 2005. the first couple years, i replace my print head and, then i discovered that eventually the white filler in the tanks will bread down and clog the jets. 
for a while you can clean them, but inevitably they would not clean up, and i thought i needed a new printhead. 
and they are not cheap either. 
then i discovered that i could just buy the very expensive set of black plus 3 colors of genuine canon tanks once a year, then refill them for a year. 
no more printheads since then. 
as i said i don't hesitate to print a needed manual. 
i once printed a 200 page manual for a sewing machine. 
i never think twice about making printouts. 
i am not exactly sure, but i would estimate that i have spent less than $200 for ink since 1999, for two printers. 
and my husband is still using a canon printer that is 7 years old.
