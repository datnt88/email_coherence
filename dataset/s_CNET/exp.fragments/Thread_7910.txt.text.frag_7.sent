if the problem appears when the system shakes, then either a poor connection or bad port. 
please verify the proper ps/2 is just that using the one for mouse and kybd. 
correctly(review manual). 
now, if the problem persists, then yes, swap it out with a replacement since this is so new. 
since, you need to remove anyways, tear it down and inspect it, sometimes a cold solder joint at the ps/2 connections and/or possible grounding/short there. 
since, this is so new and you tried a &quot;minimum system right, install only the basic essentials, you need no drives, just see if it gets anywhere and proceed to the next level. 
again, if it persists problem wise, return.
