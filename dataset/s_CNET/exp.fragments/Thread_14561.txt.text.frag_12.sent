i don't think this is a good question for a forum that's listed under hardware in the index. 
moreover, it's not clear if you mean c or c++ (that should make a difference for the coding you need). 
and can you tell more about what you mean &quot;make a command to printer&quot;. 
please repost with this additions in computer help.
