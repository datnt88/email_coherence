i'm running xp home sp2 on sony vaio pcv rs-712 with sony dvd cd rewritable drive (model dw-d22a) and hitachi-lg dvd-rom drive (model gdr-8163b (syao). the two drives stopped detecting inserted discs at the same time. 
i've tried the &quot;troubleshooting&quot; help with no success. 
device manager states everything is o.k. i can't use the disc cleaner as the discs don't spin. 
i've tried every kind of disc i have with no success. 
i opened the drives to clean the lenses but couldn't see anything that looked like a lens. 
i used a lot of compressed air in any opening there was. 
still no success. 
i checked for firmware updates - but i have the latest. 
i tried the windows driver update, but was told i had the best driver. 
could there be a registry setting that's wrong? 
what other things could i try? an old-timer trying to keep up.
