perhaps your dsl modem is actually a modem/router, and it is giving ip addresses in the same range as your dlink router. 
what i'd try is disconnecting the dsl router and trying 192.168.0.1 again to get into the router and set it up to give out addresses in some other range (10.0.0.0 is a good range)
