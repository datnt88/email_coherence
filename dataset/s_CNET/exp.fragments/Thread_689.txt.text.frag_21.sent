i was about to make the jump into more professional printing and get a large format printer. 
since getting the epson r260 for cd/dvd printing i was impressed by its quality so i had decided to go with the r2880 over the h p b9180, thank god i waited! 
this past week my r260 was getting very low on ink so i purchased oem replacement cartrages from a reputable nation wide dealer. 
when i installed the new cartrages the printer said they wheren't genuine epson cartrages and wouldn't let me print, it just froze up! 
i tried everything including replacing the new cartrages with the old, booting the printer with no cartrages, etc... to no avail. 
after doing some reaserch online i found out that epson did this intentionally to not only keep us from using third party cartrages, but it also has an internal counter that when it reaches a certain number of prints and passes with the print head, it disables the unit thus requiring you to replace it. 
i don't know if hewlettt packard does this kind of thing to its customers but the hp's i've used over the years have done me well. 
the only time they quit on me was when i wore them out mechanically after thousands of prints. 
i'm going to use hp printers from now on...
