cnet has some good info on building a new machine. 
i just put together the following system amd 64 /3000 - 512 mem - 80g sata hd - cd/dvd burner - ati 9800 video card - epox mb os xp home sp2. 
i used my old crt and accessories. 
total cost with taxes and shipping came to a shade more than $800 total. 
i used newegg.com 
for most of the parts. 
they have reviews of the parts as well as very good customer service. 
you will learn about all the different choises you have available on chip and motherboard combinations. 
for cost reasons i choose the amd 64 vs the intel chip. 
you can get some good buys on amd xp chips but they are at the end of their development. 
i figured i could go with the 754 socket in the amd 64 line and get a couple more years of service by up grading the cpu when the prices drop on the 3800+ versions.
