it can work, but i was concerned that the nat/routers may not know how to handle the packet bound for the other lan. 
good to see it works. 
&quot;it seems to works... but did i do it correctly?&quot; the file sharing and route to/from each lan may fail. 
if so, you change the netmask so that both lans are in the same lan.
