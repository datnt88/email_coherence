it's a little less than your gt 220 and why i picked is for the fanless design. 
it's silent. 
i also put my hp d4999t on the p3 watt meter and the entire system tops out at 120 watts so this means the stock 325 watt power supply is not stressed. 
hope this helps. 
bob ps. i run 1080p pictures on mine.
