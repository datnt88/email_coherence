if &quot;top hat&quot; means &quot;hot flashing&quot; placing one ic over another, then you're on your own. it may work it may not on its own merits. 
further, having successfully done it, you still need *very similar* mtrbd. 
bios otherwise, features will get hosed or simply place a corrupted bios(to org. 
mtrbd.) from new source and get flaky even if boots-up which alone is good but not 100% as you may find out. 
if it gets this far, you can then try reflashing again to the corrupted bios from org. 
bios file to rebuild it to its &quot;proper bios level&quot; or any working revision now current.
