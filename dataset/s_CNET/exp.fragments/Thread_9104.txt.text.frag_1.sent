i have a fairly lower end gaming setup consisting of an fx-4100, gtx 650ti, 550w xfx psu, and a gigabyte ga-78lmt-s2 mobo. 
i have the graphics card connected to my 23&quot; 1080p asus monitor. 
i would like to connect my computer to my 720p tv for throwing a video/movie on every now and again. 
this way, i will not have to sit at my desk to watch videos/movies. 
i'm not sure whether connecting my tv to the graphics card as a second monitor will lower my gaming performance or not. 
i also have the gt 610 that i upgraded from in the closet that i believe i could connect, and use for the second monitor, as well. 
i need some suggestions/advice on how i should connect my tv to my desktop in order to get the best performance and usability out of it.
