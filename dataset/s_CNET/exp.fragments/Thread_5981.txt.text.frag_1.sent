so whenever i put my desktop to sleep and then turn it back on, i cannot connect to the internet. 
my laptops are fine and can connect to the internet w/ the wireless however. 
when i have windows diagnostic run a troubleshoot and repair, it tells me it can't communicate w/ the primary dns server and that resetting the local area connection will fix it (and it does). 
if i restart the computer, it seems to fix this problem as well. 
here's a pic: i don't get why it can't communicate w/ the dns and that i have to manually reset the lac everytime i turn on the computer from sleep mode... if it helps: i got a vista xp desktop, a netgear n600 wireless router, and an arris touchstone telephony modem tm402g i'm a bit of a computer newb/average, so please don't get too complex
