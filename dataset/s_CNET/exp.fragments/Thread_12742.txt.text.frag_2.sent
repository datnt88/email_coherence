you can't be helped. 
assuming you downloaded the xp drivers from hp.com and installed them in correct order (primarily chipset before vga), the default display mode must be beyond the range of the monitor. 
only way you can set a resolution/refresh within range of the monitor is to use another more capable monitor with wider range of display res/refresh (beg/borrow?) to alter the display mode and then re-connect to your w15v. 
via cpus derive their low power rating by using software instead of hardware to execute some functions. 
since most, if not all, low-end aios require the cpu to process vector graphics, the c7 is likely underpowered for the task.
