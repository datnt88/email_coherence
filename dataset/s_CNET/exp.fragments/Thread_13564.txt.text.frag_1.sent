going to replace hard drive on titanium pbg4. 
becoming audible when it was whisper quiet before and i don't want to be caught. 
it also seems to be slower but that could be imagination working. 
how does one decide ? 
what are the prime considerations other than size and price? 
rotational speed? 
4200 5400 7200? is faster always better? 
seek times? 
brand? 
thanks for any insights.
