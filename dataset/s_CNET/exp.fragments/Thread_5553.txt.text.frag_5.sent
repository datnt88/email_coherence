there are two limit which you may encounter. 
one is the firmware limit (bios), the other is software limit (the os). 
because you are using usb (something else may come into play here); can't place my fingures on it but it may be there. 
as software goes, xp has a fix for it; maxtor also has fix for the other os...check their website. 
if it's the firmware problem, possible solution would be to check for bios update or get a bios interface card (mine came with the maxtor drive). 
in your case, i don't know if it's worthwhile or not (for that extra 35gb). 
but anyway, good luck.
