hi, recently i have bought some extra ram for my old packard bell. 
at current it has 256mb of ram but once i get the ram in the mail an installed it i will have 512mb. 
going to the next step is replacing the cpu. 
i don't know if i will but i would like to get some info on it anyway. 
i have a gigabyte ga-8siml which supports intel socket 478 and 400 fsb. the current processor is an intel celeron 2.1ghz and my chipset is a sis 650. 
my main questions are: what is the fastest processor that my motherboard supports? 
where can i buy it? 
(i live in australia and is ebay ok?) is buying a second hand or used cpu ok? is it worth it? 
will i need a new cooler? 
is it as simple as this: -- -- or will i need to change options in the bios or in windows my current temps are around 12-14 degrees celsius and i think the cooler is an avc c7015b12m fan with this heat sink: (i don't know what it is called). 
so it looks like this: . 
at this stage i'm not sure if i want to do it but the more involved i get the more i want to do it! 
if you need any more information i will gladly try and find it for you. 
thanks.
