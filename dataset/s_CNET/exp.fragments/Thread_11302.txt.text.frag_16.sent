i need 3/8&quot; tall letters to read and i'm not quite 60 yet. 
i have a 27&quot; monitor with my desktop so i don't spend all my time scrolling back and forth. 
i'm trying to &quot;train my dragon&quot;, dragon naturally speaking 11.5 that is. 
cell phones? 
forget it. 
waay to small to read. 
i have one, for emergencies only, and i can only dial the number i need from memory because there is no way for me to read the address book.
