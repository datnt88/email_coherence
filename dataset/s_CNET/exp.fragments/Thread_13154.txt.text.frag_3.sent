you mom wants to buy a new computer ? 
because this one doesnt work?. 
cool , so that means you get this one, that may be broke?. cool. the button could be broke , but they are easy to fix.. if you know anything about computers,,pop the case and have a look, its the only way to find out. 
make sure you have a flashlight so you can see all the connections. 
you can fix it.
