i'm replacing our 4-year-old vista 32-bit 2gb ram desktop. 
we use it for web browsing, email, word processing and storage of photos, music and video. 
no gaming. 
i find it is getting slow at waking up, web browsing, switching between applications, and switching between users. 
i'm not a geek. 
i basically limit myself to running msconfig and turning off unnecessary things. 
i have also plugged in ram and other cards, but that's about it. 
i expect the biggest resource hog on our system is office 2010 professional. 
i just purchased an hp pavilion p6-2125 and am getting it ready to swap over. 
it seems to be much faster at tasks, but it is, after all, right out of the box. 
i am thinking of adding another 4gb of ram to the 4gb that is already there. 
will i notice a difference when waking it up, web browsing, switching between applications, and switching between users? 
i'm looking at kingston valueram, but someone suggested corsair cml4gx3m1a1600c9. the corsair is well reviewed for gaming and overclocking, but we don't do that. 
also, since i assume that the factory-installed 4gb is probably not a high performance stick, i wonder if adding the corsair would cause problems. 
any opinions are welcome. 
here are the specs i think are relevant: windows 7 home pro 64-bit according to hp: dual channel memory architecture two 240-pin ddr3 dimm sockets supports up to 8gb on 64-bit systems thanks!
