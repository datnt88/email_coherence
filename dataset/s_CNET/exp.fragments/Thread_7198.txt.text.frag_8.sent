i'm maintaining old palmos apps and the same story way back then. 
if you put an app on the card, behind your back it copies it to onboard memory before it launches. 
seems to be pretty easy to work with. 
isn't ics outdated now with jellybean out? 
why consider anything unless it's the latest unless the price is right? 
with google nexus and the new kindle fire hd's out i think the next few weeks will see a fire sale on older units. 
one might be just what you want.
