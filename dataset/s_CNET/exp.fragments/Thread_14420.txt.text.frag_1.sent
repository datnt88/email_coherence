hi, there are some companies that have their wireless network enabled for their staff to access to the file server. 
what i wish to know is this. 
i noticed that in order for the staff to be able to use the wireless network is to put in a password. 
each of the staff are given a kind of password generator gadget to generate password for them. 
for curiosity's sake, how does this work? 
i mean this would be a more secure way to use wireless network in a company or other private properties. 
what is this system called? 
thank you in advance
