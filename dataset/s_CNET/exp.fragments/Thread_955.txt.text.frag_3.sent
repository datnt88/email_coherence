tried every thing but a new adapter! 
was hoping i wouldnt have to replace this but i'm quite sure it would work if i did cos many people ok a few have had issues with the via rhine and say they could connect after reducing to 10 full duplex speed. 
but sadly that didn't work for me either! 
i do givw network support to a couple of small companies but this is the first time i have conceded defeat and opted to change a component! it wouldn't install clients and tcp ip version 6 either! 
its how should i say... buggered!
