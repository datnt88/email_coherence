at 5 years all electrolytic capacitors are suspect. 
that 300w psu is assured to not be able to put out that much. 
and we are talking about a 5 year old pc so it would be proper to have to disable a balky onboard nic and install some pci card to stand in. 
however you will encounter tech's that will try anything to avoid that. 
go figure.
