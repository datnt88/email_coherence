hello, i'm new in forum. 
i hope i can get some help here, and as i can see i can really start to help in some topics so, here's my question. 
i have a simple switch of 24 ports from zte and i have another equipment contected to it in one port. the port is up, but i can't ping the equipment. 
after 1minute (sometimes more, sometimes less) when port learns the other equipment's mac address it goes down. 
i already tested. 
the port is up while i'm checking mac table and there's no mac in port. 
when finally port learns the mac i will check port state again and it is down. 
some seconds later port is up again and everything starts again. 
anyone have a idea what's can be the problem? 
i already check negotion parameters and mac learning. 
it's everyting ok.
