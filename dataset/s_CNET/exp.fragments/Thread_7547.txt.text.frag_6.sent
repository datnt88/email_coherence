if you want it fixed, take it to the apple repair counter. 
you have proved to me it's that machine. 
as it could be a board issue and you demand a fix then let's get to the right counter. 
otherwise try the cnet apple forums and ask about the os repair. 
then again i've run into folk that demand to know if that will fix it. 
for the demanding types you have to go back to what will absolutely fix it. 
that is the apple repair counter or a new machine.
