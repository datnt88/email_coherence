looking in the bios, primary ide and slave aere not detected. 
the ide controller is set to both. 
upon startup the message is flashing &quot;2+0 stripe is offline&quot;, however, the computer starts and runs fine. the device manager lists the disk drive as, promise 1+0 span scsi device, and under properties for this drive the 2 boxes (disable tagged queing, and disable synchronous transfers) are both unchecked. 
so, what will happen if i replace the dead drive?
