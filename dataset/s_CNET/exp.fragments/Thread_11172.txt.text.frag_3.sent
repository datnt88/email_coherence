yes, that's right. the machine did not come with win xp when i bought it. 
i believe, it came with some linux os. i reinstalled the win xp pro in the comp. 
i can see the sticker on the bottom of the laptop, saying that it contains atheros card. 
also, i was able to use the wireless with atheros, till around 2 months back. 
i'm sure that the wireless would work if the red x is removed from the wireless network connections in the network connections window, but i dont know what and where to check, to get it connected. 
apprecaite your assistance. 
regards,
