hey thanks... ok if i connect a switch to a router, is that connected with a crossover cable or just a standard cable? 
same with the punch panel to the switch...standard or crossover cable? the splitters will be used for rg6 cable splitting and i was asking is this the way to route the cable the signal. 
i have no telephone service yet, and not sure i will, but i was going to use 4 wires of one cat5 cable to wire one phone connection and the other 4 wires of the cat5 cable for the other phone line. 
similarly i was going to use a 66 panel to wire all the phone lines.
