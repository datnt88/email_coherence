ibm is not about the latest fire breathing system. 
so you decide if you like their units and what remains to be in the pc industry some of the best support. 
the apple is top in service and if you pump enough into a box you have a nice dual cpu machine that will run what you can have on the mac with ease. the hp/compaq has a wide selection from boxed ready to use units to custom units that can be what you want. 
service seems to be above average.
