hi steve; thanks for you tips but i have tried them and set both computers up that way, also made sure that the &quot;file and print sharing&quot; and the &quot;local area connection settings&quot; were checked in both computers and still no access allowed. 
i set myself up as the administrator using my computer name on the other computer and still can't gain permission to open the shared files on that computer. 
i have tried to find a way to set the permission for file sharing in my &quot;computer management&quot; section but there doesn't seem to be an option to select the shared files folder/permissions...any other ideas? 
i have a mcafee on one of the computers but i always shut it off before trying to access the network and i have shut off both computer firewalls. 
i also have the adaware program on my computer...would that cause a problem? 
thanks a lot for any help you can give, i really appreciate it..i am determined to beat this silly thing, i don't think setting up a &quot;simple&quot; home network should be this complicated. 
i am sure it is some little setting somewhere that needs to be checked if i only knew where.
