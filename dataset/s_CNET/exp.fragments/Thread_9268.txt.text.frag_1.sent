i have a netgear wgr614v3, and ever since i've set it up, the connection drops every few hours (sometimes more than that). 
restarting the router does the trick, but it's a big problem. 
i have a comcast cable connection, and there's no problem when the modem and computer are directly connected. 
my main computer is connected to the router via ethernet, and then about 3 or 4 of my housemates connect over the wireless. 
i've updated the firmware, enabled wpa, broadcast the ssid. 
any idea what's causing the constant disconnections? 
is this an interference problem? 
something to do with ip addresses? 
or is netgear just unreliable?
