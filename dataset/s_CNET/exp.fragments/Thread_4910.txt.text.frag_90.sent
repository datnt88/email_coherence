i bought the gm5632e as a floor model. 
1st thing i noticed in the event log was the 1 hr crash you mentioned but the last one seems to have occured 12/16/07. 
it has not crashed since. 
i bought it in feb 08 and i'm trying to test it by force the situation by keeping it on for extended periods and running a ton of programs. 
any other suggestions to tell if mine has the flaw or do they all? 
also, for the love of g-d how do i install a dual boot on this machine. 
i have an xp pro disc (sp 2 is not included i have that on another disc.) i can not get the install to begin. 
any suggestions? 
has anyone else suceeded and can i install on the 2nd drive?
