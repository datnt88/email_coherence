any opinions are very welcome, even if it's just a suggestion to get something slightly different, or a &quot;yep, that looks good&quot;. 
what i will be doing with the system: -online gaming (i want good performance here) -some (very simple) graphics work and photo editing... just simple stuff for my personal use. 
-school/work (internet browsing/documents) here's what i've found: *case *monitor or *keyboard and mouse *speaker *motherboard *processor *memory or *hard drive *cd/dvd-rom *video card *sound card *power supply *operating system vista, provably. 
possibly xp. have a source for either. 
i'm looking to keep the sub-total for everything between 1.2k and 1k (it's at about 1k right now). 
thanks!
