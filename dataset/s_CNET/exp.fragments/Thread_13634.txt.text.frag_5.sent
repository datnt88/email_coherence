hello, the best way to connect your ps2 to the wireless network is via a wifi repeater as is sold in the store pixinf. 
this device lets you connect your ps2 to the wireless network anywhere on the home and increases the signal range of existing wireless network. 
works for me perfectly and also use to connect the tv to the internet. 
here is the link: greetings
