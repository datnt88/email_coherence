hi! i have noticed all the hardwares comments, and many are good ideas (but more expensive). 
what about using software readily available from others to accomplish much the same thing? 
a daily new password, generated by that system, can be very effective. 
then you can provide a &quot;templated&quot; access to the net, making it difficult for one to just leech from afar. 
such software does not totally eliminate net access, but makes it more unlikely to be usable by non-customers. 
customers with proper daily passwords would be able to by-pass the templated screen to surf anywhere (or not), and that would cut down access time. 
also could provide timed sessions, tailored to their expected time online (for example, a password change after 45 minutes, etc). 
sure, softwares can eventually be &quot;hacked,&quot; but not if a daily password is used. 
i used to use software like this to remotely control a pub's wifi system, and it worked very well with a minimum of new expenses. 
good luck with your decision!
