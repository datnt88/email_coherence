i had to order a restoral disk. 
i was never aware that i had a raid system, i didn't even know what raid was.the restoral disk fixed my system but now i have only one 120 gig hard drive. 
i assume that my system has been operating as a regular computer and one of my drives is dead. 
what happens if i add another drive, i need more space. 
if i replace the dead drive, will my system try to reconfigure? 
could i lose all my data again?
