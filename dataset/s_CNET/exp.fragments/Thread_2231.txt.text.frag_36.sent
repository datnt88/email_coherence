2560 x 1600 on mac 30 inch cinema hd screen. 
fonts of all sizes are easily readable. 
i use an nvidia fx3700 graphics card. 
to me there is no better viewing than a large screen (mine is now 5 years old and still fine) for design & general work or game play. 
i am also using 4 250 gb barracuda drives in an f5 raid array for extra speed and data security.
