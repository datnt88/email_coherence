well, that didn't help. 
i installed the driver updater you linked to, and now everytime i boot up it asks to run in either safe mode or normal mode or whatever but which ever one i pick it gives me a blue screen that says something like an error occured and windows has shut down, please search for virus etc.. but the problem is i cant start windows up now. 
i really need help i dont want to spend another $50 bringing this thing to the computer shop in town.
