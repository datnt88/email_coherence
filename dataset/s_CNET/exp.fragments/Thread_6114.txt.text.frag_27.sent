i've been wanting to get the iphantom for my home network. 
i do have two questions. 
1. will the iphantom protect ports that software is &quot;listening&quot; to? 
or does it have a way to &quot;poke holes&quot; in the firewall that would unsecure the ports? 
2. does iphantom cause latency or other issues with world of warcraft online play? 
thanks!
