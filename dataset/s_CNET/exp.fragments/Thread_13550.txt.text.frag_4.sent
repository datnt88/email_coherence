if you can be precise about accounts, ntfs is being used and more, then we can proceed. 
i forgot to mention the need for ntfs since without, this will not work. 
let's start with &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;owners&quot;. 
you could have a shared directory that is full access to some &quot;group&quot;. 
or you could set the group access to read-only and some other group would have full access. 
put people in each group depending on the effect you want. 
as you can tell, such is all in the words and understanding rights, groups, owners, ownership and some tools. 
one tool is cacls or xcacls or similar. 
you pick which is your cup of tea. 
have you been to a book store and looked at books on administration?
