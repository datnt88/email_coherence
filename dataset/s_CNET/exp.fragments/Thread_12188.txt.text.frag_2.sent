1. unlike the mac, the pc is fun as you find all the drivers for motherboard, network card that microsoft does not supply. 
do not use microsoft as a source for the drivers. 
2. there can be a power save setting in the usb and network card. 
set it to &quot;disable.&quot; in closing, i only guide and never supply step by step instructions.
