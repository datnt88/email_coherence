alright, my usb is startin to mess up now it won't read the things i put it it [ mouse and all of that ] i really need my usb port for a lot of my musicial devices. 
everytime i put something in it it won't read and if i keep taking it out and putting it in it says something about a power surge. 
should i buy a new usb or will the problems still happen? 
please help me, i'll pretty much buy anything to help my problem.
