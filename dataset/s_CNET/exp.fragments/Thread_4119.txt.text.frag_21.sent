my first thought is what a lot of people will respond- your problem sounds like the result of malware, some virus or spyware that is taking up system resources, or perhaps the malware has damaged a windows component. 
my previous xp pc got malware on it, and though anti-malware programs appeared to clean it successfully, nothing ran quite as well as before. 
after i wiped the hard drive and reinstalled windows, games and everything else ran much better. 
since you describe only the problem, here are some questions: do you use a risky download program such as limewire? 
(this program can easily let a virus onto the pc... torrent downloads are generally safe, but not limewire- it opens a door for viruses.) are there any other signs of malware, especially slow performance? is the poor performance limited to games? 
if you're confident that the problem is not a virus, then some other questions would be: how many processes does your pc have running in the background? 
has anything new besides games been installed since this problem began? 
(try reducing the unnecessary processes running in the background by using msconfig or another program.) try uninstalling the driver for your video card and reinstalling it. 
do you use the ati catalyst control center? 
if so, set it so that the application controls the graphics quality. 
also try closing out the ati ccc, to see if that would make a difference- you can end its process from the task manager. 
has there been anything else installed such as a sound card? 
if so, try disabling this device. 
if hardware failure is causing this problem, that would be rare and more difficult to diagnose. 
does the fan on the card run any louder since the problem began? 
if so, that would again be a sign that something in the background is taking up processing power, forcing it to work harder. 
hope this helps, glen
