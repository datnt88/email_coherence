i have one of the above printers. the scanner has failed. 
on opening up it was obvious that one end of the connecting wire to the slim flourescent light tube has broken off. the local epson agents refuse to supply me with a spare and instead want the price i can buy a new printer, to do what they call a repair job. 
anyone know where i can source a new light at a reasonable cost?
