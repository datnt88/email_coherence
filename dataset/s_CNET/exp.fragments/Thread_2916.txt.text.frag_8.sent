while crucial will look at the machine to note combinations that work, the brand you chose is more generic. 
it would up to you to do the engineering research about how many banks are in the sticks and if there are sufficient chip selects in the memory controller to support these sticks. 
while i have the background to do that research it does not help you get these sticks working. 
all it does is tell us to call and ask which sticks to get.
