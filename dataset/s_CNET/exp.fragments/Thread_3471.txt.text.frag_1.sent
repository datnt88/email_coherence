i have three computers connected to a dsl/router. 
two connect to the internet ok. the one i am having trouble with is running win98 se and i am using a belkin f5d7050 usb wireless connection. 
it can connect to the router, and i can 'see' files on the win98 computer from the other computers. 
there is no way however that i can connect to the internet with it - even though the other two computers can. 
any ideas? 
i have checked that the computer name is unique and that the workgroup is the same. the router assigns it a dhcp ip address, but i cannot get onto the internet. 
please help!
