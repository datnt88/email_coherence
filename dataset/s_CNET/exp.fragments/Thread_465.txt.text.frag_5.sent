about six months ago my p4, 3 gig mobo went south for the second time, so i decided it was time for a new system. 
went with a core 2 quad, 2.4 gig, 4 gig ram, vista business, duel nvida 8800 gt's (sli) with duel acer 22&quot; widescreen lcd's. 
originally i went with a creative audigy card but recently switched to a razor instead. 
love it!
