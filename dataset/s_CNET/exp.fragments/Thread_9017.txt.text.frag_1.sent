hello cnet, my name's robert, and i recently got a upgraded video card which has been causing some issues once i installed it. 
i was using a radeon hd 4600 series then upgraded to an asus radeon hd 7770. 
before installing the new card i uninstalled the old driver through control panel, then shutdown, installed new card, rebooted and installed the new driver. 
during my gaming sessions i would notice random screen tears happening, it would only be for less than a second but it would happen every few hours sometimes back to back when it did occur. 
after the tears started to become more frequent then i would be getting blue screens, i was always checking my temps they were fine, my 6pin is connected. 
i then read online to install &quot;driversweeper&quot; to remove all existing drivers that may be causing interference which i did, then after i uninstalled those drivers it had me reboot, now during startup and i can't get to my desktop without getting a bluescreen. 
i was just going to whipe my computer with my vista disk but that is not working. 
any way to resolve this without whiping my computer?
