thanks for the time vapcmd, but i have the cpus in my possesion and i need to choose between them (can't keep both). 
besides this is a socket 754 board, so ''dual core'' chips will not be of help to me. 
do you (or anyone else) know of a reason one of these cpus should be favored over the other? 
thanks again for your attention - dam j
