hello folks, im looking for some answers to the above new wireless router i have ? 
1: im going to be adding an external hard drive to this device as to share media with 2 xbox`s and another laptop. 
i have tried using 2 flash drives as a test run but what has happend is only one of these flash drives can be accessed from my other devices and the other appears to have nothing on it when accessed via my new router , is there any reason for this ? 
both flash drives are formatted fat32. 
and when i do add my new external is there anything i should be avoiding ? 
2: i am also thinking of adding a wireless range extender or repeater as my 5ghz signal is being recieved too weak for the 2 xbox`s. 
if anyone can offer any help and support here then i would be extremely greatful.
