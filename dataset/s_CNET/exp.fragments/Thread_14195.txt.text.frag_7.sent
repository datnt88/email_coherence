i know you are wanting to have some shared portable drive from mac to pc and fat32 is one shareable file system. 
but the lesson i learned was this. 
to connect such a drive i do this. 
mac? 
connect with firewire. 
pc? connect with usb. 
while both should work on either the operative word in this is &quot;should&quot;. 
i'm sharing my free lesson so you can use it if you can. 
maybe it will help, maybe not. 
for now we just use those usb memory keys and networks to fling files around.
