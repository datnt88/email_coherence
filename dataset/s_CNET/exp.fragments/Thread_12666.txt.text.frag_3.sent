thanks! i think we'll go ahead and get it then. 
i just got mine a few weeks ago and it came with windows 7 so we assume if she gets the exact same thing it will come with the same stuff. 
but i will ask to make sure. 
i'm pleased with the emachine. 
the only difference i can tell between this and my last dell is the download time. 
things take a little longer but for the price i can live with that.
