yes i put the old psu back in to double check, but it's the same reading. 
it's like the sensor is stuck now on 2 volts. 
but again, my system is running great, stable, and cool. 
i have sinced put the new corsair psu back in, since the voltage readings are the same. 
hardware monitor ite it8721 voltage 0 5.24 volts [0x69] (+12v) voltage 1 2.58 volts [0x7b] (+5v) voltage 2 2.02 volts [0xaa] (cpu vcore) voltage values cpu core 2.028 v motherboard 30 c (86 f) cpu #1 / core #1 34 c (93 f) cpu #1 / core #2 34 c (93 f) cpu #1 / core #3 34 c (93 f) cpu #1 / core #4 34 c (93 f) cpu #1 / core #5 34 c (93 f) cpu #1 / core #6 34 c (93 f)
