its not moving around. the printer is connected to a desktop. 
however, system updates during the night, sometimes cause a restart of the unit plus i live in the boonies and lose service at least once a day. 
if i set my router to static ip, i guess it won't really effect the kids when they come down with their machines. 
i could set the printer up on bluetooth but i am concerned about the range. 
again thanks for moving me in the right direction
