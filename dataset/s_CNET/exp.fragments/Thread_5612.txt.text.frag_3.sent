see anything on the partitions of that original drive? 
if so, try salvaging whatever you can off the partitions to a cd (or copy everything over to the current drive you are using). 
once you have salvaged what you can try putting the drive back in a the master c: drive to boot with, and use your bootdisk to get to the a: prompt....then see if a fdisk /mbr command will put things back right. 
(this is assuming it's anything other than xp as other things might need to be done to see if the drive can be recovered). 
which free recovery programs did you use before and how were they used?
