also not an expert, i too have a new inspiron e1505 with the same intel pro wireless 3945 and i just connected to this router: linksys srx200 wireless-g broadband routers with srx (wrt54gx2) and then networked with an older laptop dell latitude c600 (wired). 
i currently have powerlink highspeed internet that is 100 mbps via wired connection. is there anyway to get higher speed than 54 mbps wireless???? also i find when running on battery power my inspiron has a very hard time maintaining the wireless connection. is there a configuration i need to change? 
could my cordless phone be effecting connectivity????
