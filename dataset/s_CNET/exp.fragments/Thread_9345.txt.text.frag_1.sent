hello folks, i am looking into buying a media center desktop. 
i have looked at some of the larger commercial companies as well as smaller ones like velocity micro. 
i would like the following in my pc:&lt;div&gt;i7 processor blu-ray drive (dont need to write blu-ray, combo with dvd-r preferred) decent 1-2 gb video card that supports hdmi upmarket sound card (3 mm ok, rca preferred) tv tuner (not as familiar with these, but hdmi compatibility is a must) 1 tb hd or better bluetooth compatibility on the wireless card my budget is between $1000-1500. 
i am a bit overwhelmed by the options available these days not to mention the company websites are so-so at describing the options available on customization. 
i primarily want to hook this pc up to my lcd tv and use it as a conduit for tv, music and streaming media. 
also, reliability of the product is important. 
i was interested in vm initially but some of the reviews i had read were not so supportive. 
i like the smaller brands due to the lack of bs software that comes pre-loaded with them. 
thanks in advance for the advice! 
&lt;/div&gt;
