i always price compare and research everything. 
no matter if it's a stick of gum or a computer bundle. 
coscto beats competitor's hands down for price. 
i was po'd because i have that coupon you mention, but i needed my system now, so had to eat the $100 savings . 
but because i had trouble with my previous a6077c, i returned it and saved $300. 
so i'm happy. 
oh! i also got some great advice from ozos about my browser issues. 
things work much better for me (and really faster) when i stopped using ie 7 & and switched to firefox 2 instead. 
i've posted a lot about typing issues, and hang time and went rounds with resolutions at hp and costco concierge tech support. 
i took ozos advice and downloaded my free version of firefox at and i am impressed!!!! no more ie for me!!!!
