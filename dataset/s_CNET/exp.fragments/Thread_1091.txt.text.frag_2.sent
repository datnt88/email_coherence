dont blame the graphics card as it could be from other factors that you are experiencing these problems. 
have u thought about overheating? 
or say a faulty graphics card which u couldve rma'd. 
how about listing the specs on your computer? 
and graphic ripple? 
what do u mean by this? and u said that u would buy a new psu if u get an ati card? 
so i am assuming u know u already have a lack of power? 
now i may be wrong...
