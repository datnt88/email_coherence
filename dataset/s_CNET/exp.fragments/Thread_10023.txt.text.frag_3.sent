i had it on obtain the ip automatically. 
i made sure the dhcp server was enabled. 
i set it up like i did the last time i networked some computers. 
like you said, i find it very odd. 
after it didnt work i reseted the router to the defaults-and still nothing. 
i thought it might be the pc so i ran the network wizard and ran home and small business networking. 
nothing. 
i started to run the disk that linksys gave me(suppossed to not be required to run) but it kept giving me error about not being able to reach the internet. 
thats because the modem is still in the single user setting.(which 
i had to put it in to run the linksys program so it could access the internet. 
then i hooked the router up like it said(maybe i should have put the setting back to &quot;bridged&quot; in the modem.) im a slightly confused as to what needs to be done.
