i can boot up fine using the integrated card, just not the external one. 
i guess it must be the card then. 
i was thinking that maybe changing the resolution could affect the splash screen. 
if not, then i definitely destroyed the card. 
i did mess with the card when it stopped working, and i do have a network card which partially obstructs the airflow from the card's fan. 
i probably screwed it up. 
crud.
