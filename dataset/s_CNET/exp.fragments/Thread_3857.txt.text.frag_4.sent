i had an athlon xp 3200+. 
i had the same problem when running even simple games, i ran some tests on it and found that the cpu was getting very hot. 
upon further research i found that this whole line of cpu's runs notoriously hot. 
i'd recommend downloading a program to check your temp. 
if its too hot, try buying some better thermal grease (i use arctic silver.) apply that to your athlon and give it a try. 
i had to do it a couple times to get the right amount, too much = too hot, too little = too hot. that should fix the problem, your comp is doing exactly what mine did.
