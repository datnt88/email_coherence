i bought myself a samsung galaxy tab2 at xmas, and after a couple of days it started updating to jb. it warned me i might &quot;lose&quot; some of the apps i'd installed,so i held my breath, but all was ok. can't say i noticed any change after the upgrade(it told me it had updated successfully), but am still getting used to it anyway. 
so far i'm loving it!
