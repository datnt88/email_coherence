i could not find anything listed as device manager. 
i did go into system tools and from there to system information and clicked on components. 
that is where an item, cd-rom is listed but nowhere could i find anything about the burner. 
i did not go into bios setup as i do not know how to do this. 
do i do this in run? 
under my computer both a cd drive and dvd drive are listed sorry, but i'm not that conversant about these things. 
maybe i'll have to take the thing back where i bought it and ask them to check it out. 
thanks
