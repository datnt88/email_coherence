kenhusveg is, more or less, right. 
usb sticks are generally cheap, and they do fail over time. 
so that would cover that. 
as for brands, some would swear by sandisk; based on personal experience, i certainly do not. the thing that has lasted me the longest so far, is a 256 mb sony. 
you may care to look at incl. the comments. 
my choice for reliability is sd cards mounted as usb sticks, since they beat even optical disks.
