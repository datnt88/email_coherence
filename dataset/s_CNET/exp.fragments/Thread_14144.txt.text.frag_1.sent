anybody familiar with a thermaltke v1? thermaltake v1 p/n:cl-p0401 i can't register at their forums. 
some debug error. 
won't let me register. 
it is great good reviews and all. 
the only thing is the fan connector is 3 pin. 
my motherboard is 4 pin for cpu? 
should i connect it anyway to the 3 and leave the 4th alone? 
or should i take it back? 
thanks, confusimo
