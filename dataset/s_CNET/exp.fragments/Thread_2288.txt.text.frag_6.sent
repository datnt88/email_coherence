ok well whats the minimum needed for the bios to come up? 
i took everything out of the case, and started over, and right now, i have the mobo, cpu, 1 stick of ram, psu, and video card plugged in. 
still nothing....just that little orange light on the monitor...never changing...always mocking me. 
my baseball bat is starting to look very useful right now. 
minimal number of wires plugged in, just the stuff for the case to mobo and the power for pcu fan and vid card
