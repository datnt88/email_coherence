hi, my old powerbook g3 won't start, there's not even that familiar start-up sound, just a tiny tiny zzzzzzz from inside. 
sometimes not even that. 
on recommendation, i did buy a new battery and also tried to reset the computer, which didn't help at all. 
since that, i bought a new ibook, but it's a shame that my favorite computer, that used to be a very good computer, just is gathering dust in my cupboard. 
any ideas what could be wrong with my old friend?
