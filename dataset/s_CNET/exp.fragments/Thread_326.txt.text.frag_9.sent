once i've removed the u3 software i've used the hp formating tool (even on non hp sticks!) to format the stick. 
but there's the linux way so let's do that. 
has a variety of livecds to choose from and at we see how to use fdisk to partition our usb stick. 
i don't offer tutorials in the forums since that usually duplicates content on the web. 
but i do try to point at solutions i've used before.
