you really need to help me before i start crying. 
this is the first time that this has happened to me. 
i by mistake deleted my hdd. 
like all the partitions went boom. 
i was messing around in kubuntu linux and by mistake i deleted my hdd. 
now i need to recover everything. 
i have three partitions, one is my primary windows xp, second has all my data. 
both of these are ntfs and the last one is a fat32 and it has a few mb of data which i dont mind aprting with but it would be a great thing if recovered them. 
my priority is the data partition then the win xp and then finally the fat32. 
firstly do you think i am dead because of this or will it be possible for me to recover my hdd? 
i got getdataback ntfs. 
do you think i should use this? as i am totally new to format recovery, can you guide through the steps i should take? 
right now i am on a laptop and the deleted hdd is connected via usb as it is in an enclosure. 
i am really scared. 
please help.
