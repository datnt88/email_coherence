this may seem like the silliest question ever, but it can be applicable to many appliances. 
i'm trying to buy an american iron (austrian ones leave much to be desired), but all that i look at say only 120v, so i haven't purchased one. 
however, am i looking at the wrong part of the tag? 
i only want to use an adaptor, not converter, should i be checking for 60 hz instead? 
thank you.
