someone has one every week. 
if it't not one store, it's the other. 
compusa, circuit city, staples, etc. some bring you under $100 after mailing in a rebate; some are instant discounts. 
online places like newegg.com, geeks.com, 
chiefvalue, zipzoomfly, etc. have them every day--no rebate required. 
check techbargains.com 
for the deals (updated frequently). 
price comparision sites like pricegrabber.com are helpful, too.
