frank, don't get your hopes up too much. 
several people have gotten their gw (to hell) boxes to work without reboots for 7 to 10 days, only to have the problem come back. 
given your description of your tech (un)support session, i'm highly doubtful your problem is fixed. 
as for me, the p.o.s gateway went back to costco a few weeks ago and my new hp has been running fine since then. 
good luck to you.
