in most cases the &quot;backlight&quot; portion or its related power source is kaput or going out. 
lcds rely on such to lite the screen. 
if you closely by a outside light source, you should still see abit low light display on the screen. 
if so found then that's your problem. 
you can have send to be repaired if under warranty or any other reputable source or just replace. 
if repair is 50% or more than up to you to replace. the quickest test is to swap monitors to check video output and if you get display then more than likely the lcd is flaky.
