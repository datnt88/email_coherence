it appears that a hidden service has control of the device. 
when i called hp, they told me that they only support tv capture with media center. 
i've tried every application. 
made sure i disabled all the services that may be running that are associated with media center. 
still it seems that media center is taking control of the device and is not allowing any other applications to use it. 
can somebody find a registry setting or command to disable media center entirely?
