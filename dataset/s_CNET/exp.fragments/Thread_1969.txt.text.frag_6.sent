trendnet just returned an email i sent them. 
they think the problem is being caused by interference and asked me to change the channel. 
it is currently on the default channel 6 but cannot figure out how to change it. the user manual does not seem to show how. 
do you think this is a realistic solution? 
and any idea how to change it? 
thanks for the help bob.
