i suspect you have a monitor issue. 
some things to fuss with. 
use the degauss feature of the monitor a couple of times...see if anything changes. 
verify the refresh rate and screen res selected are supported by the monitor. 
beg/borrow/steal another monitor for a test. 
take your monitor to another machine for a test.
