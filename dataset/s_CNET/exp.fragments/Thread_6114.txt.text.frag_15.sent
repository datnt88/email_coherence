i just don't see how you can claim that the only purpose of a device like this is to be anonymous. 
i know other businesses using it besides myself. 
and no one on their network or mine download anything on p2p. 
no matter what i say, you like to circle around to conspiracy theory and 1 aspect of the device. 
there is much more to it than p2p downloading. 
i just don't think you'll ever understand that.
