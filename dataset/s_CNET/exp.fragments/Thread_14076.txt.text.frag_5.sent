why waste the electricity? 
if you aren't going to use it for at least 3 hours, turn it off! the only condition i would make is do not turn it on and off frequently. the repeated surges coming on, the temperature changes as the mb heats up and cools down are what are detrimental to the circuitry. 
the longer the hard drive is running, the more likely for some part, especially the bearings and actuator arm, to fail. 
if you will be using the computer within 3-4 hours, then put in stand by. if more, shut it off. 
your computer need &quot;down-time&quot; (sleep) just like you do.
