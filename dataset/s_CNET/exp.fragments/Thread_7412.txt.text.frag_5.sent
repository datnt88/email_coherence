i disagree about the g vs n....always get the best technology you can afford....cuz if she moves and the next place has n and she wants more speed, she'll have to cough up more cash...what a waste. 
and she has more flexibility with wi-fi usb...she can just pull it out and nobody can surf for garbage when she is not around
