hi all, i want to assemble a computer...but i have no direct experience. 
i want a step by step account to construct a celeron 1.7 ghz processor system.....right from the 'putting it together' phase to the 'frequency setting and other bios settings' phase. 
i have knowledge of computer hardware but i have never done it by myself. 
i am definately going to take some help, but it would be nice if some one knows useful sites with proper documentation and pictures. 
thanks in advance.
