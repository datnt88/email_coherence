this is the well known issue with vpn and default route. 
most the time the vpn box must be the one to insert the routes when you allow split tunneling. 
the ones i have used let you key in a list of routes to insert. the vpn box is the only one that knows all the information to do this. 
i have no knowledge of your particular vpn device. 
although it is painful to get figured out you can let the pptp have the default and put in routes for everything else to the local gateway. 
if this was a corporate network it is somewhat easier but for internet you could use route add 0.0.0.0 mask 128.0.0.0 (networks 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255) route add 128.0.0.0 mask 192.0.0.0 (network 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255) route add 224.0.0.0 mask 224.0.0.0 (network 224.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255) route add 192.0.0.0 mask 255.128.0.0 (network 192.0.0.0 - 192.127.255.255) etc etc in effect what you are doing is routing everything except 192.168.x.x to the pc gateway. 
since you have routes for everything except this one the default becomes that route. 
this can be a bat file run at login since it really is the default route once you get it complete. 
i would look hard to see if your vpn vendor has a solution to split tunnel. 
this is one of the many issues why split tunnel is not allowed at most companies, not to mention the security issue.
