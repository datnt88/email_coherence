i have used generic inks in both my epson 740(which is still working)and in my current canon ip4000.....never had a problem w/ inks....and there definitely is a savings. 
are all generic inks equal? 
well for my money i've been using insell.com for over 2 yrs and have never had a problem. 
they are great folk to do business w/. infact i will not purchase a printer that i can't use generic inks in.
