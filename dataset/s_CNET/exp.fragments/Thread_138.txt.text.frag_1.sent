i'm trying to rebuild a 486dx4/100. 
it was working in it's old case, but the power supply fan had stopped, plus the case was huge & ugly. the power supply looked like a big job to swap over, as it is soldered to the switches etc... (i have another 486 for parts) so i decided to carefully put the working one into the other case with the functional (and newer) power supply. 
all seemed to go well untill i booted up, ... the drives spin up but that's all. 
nothing ! 
not even 'post' or any beeps. 
i've re-checked the ribbon cables, tried other cables, re-checked plug/socket connection .... what have i missed it is a 'no name' motherboard with an intel dx40dpr100 (overdrive) cpu, & ali m1487b1 & m1489a1 chips. 
16mb fast page ram, 4 pci slots (one with the video card) and two hard drives. 
all is as it was when it was working in the old case, apart from the power supply (old one was 150 watt/ new one 200 watt) any ideas out there ?
