greetings. 
i wonder if someone could please help me. 
upon turning on my computer everything comes on including the initial text on the screen, however just before it starts to do the ram check (counting through the ram) the computer hangs, if i hit the restart button system restarts and go's through the ram counting process without any other problems. 
i am not experiencing any other problems with the pc what so ever. 
i am running an msi motherboard with intel chipset, 2 ghz intel celeron with 512mb ddr transcend memory module. 
any help with understanding the nature of this would be much appreciated. 
many thanks dave peter.
