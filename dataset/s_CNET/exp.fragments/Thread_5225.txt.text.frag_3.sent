the word &quot;same&quot; (ip, gateway, dns entries and netmask to 255.255.0.0), confused me a little. 
currently both lan/network are separated physically. 
can i just plug in both modem (cable and adsl) in one switch (cable + adsl modem -&gt; switch --&gt; pc's) and make the ip, gateway, dns entries and netmask to 255.255.0.0, configuration as you suggested? 
if i understand it correctly then: for the cable modem i set the ip: 192.168.1.1 for the adsl modem i set the ip: 192.168.1.2 disable dhcp set dns (as per isp (cable/adsl requirement?) set gateway (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2) set netmask (255.255.0.0 on both modem?) for the pc's, i configure each pc's accordingly. 
does it matter if they use different workgroup name? 
please advice, thank you
