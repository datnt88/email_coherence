that's what i was thinking - enclosure + hdd. 
what do you mean by when the drive crashes - you referring to one of my existing drives, or this drive (which will be used as backups)? 
i'm looking at getting a 1tb drive - don't want to pay more than $100-110 for the drive itself. 
as for the enclosure, i'd like to keep it down below $30, but could go a little higher if necessary to get something that's good quality. 
what should i look for in an enclosure? 
i'd like esata support, but if it's not worth the price premium i won't worry about it (although i will require usb 2.0.) my mobo supports firewire as well, but preliminary research has revealed that 1394 support has a significant price premium. 
also, what would be good for making sure it doesn't run too hot? 
should i go with an aluminum enclosure, one with a fan, one with vents on the case, or combo or what? 
also a few i've seen on newegg come with backup software, and a few that have esata support come with sata to esata brackets (which would use one of the 4 sata ports on my mobo. 
(i have 1 sata drive in there right now, and hope to purchase a 2nd (separate from this backup solution) (1.5tb or 2tb) internal sata drive (plus another of equal size to back that up) within the next few months or so.) if it didn't come with an esata bracket, then i'd have to either use usb (or 1394 if it supported it but those are a bit pricey i think), or spend $15-25 on an add-on card with an esata port. 
some of the products i'm looking at: internal hdds - 1 tb (1-2) enclosures: (1) , (2) , (3) , (4 - reg $49.99, $20 off w/promo code through 4-29) , (5) , (6) , (7-10) (if necessary - i.e. if i get an esata enclosure that doesn't come with an esata bracket): esata brackets: (1-4) , (5-6) add-on controllers in each above category, i'd only buy one item, and don't want to buy more than i need (for example if an enclosure comes with an esata bracket, i won't be buying a separate add-on bracket or card).
