the bestbuy model (l226wtq-bf) is listed on lg's website. the newegg model (l226wty-bf) is not listed on lg's website but newegg has a photo of the product sticker. 
newegg images of lg l226wty-bf note that the &quot;product code&quot; is l226wty-bf but the &quot;model no.&quot; (under the barcode) is l226wtq. 
so, its them same monitor but has confusing labelling.
