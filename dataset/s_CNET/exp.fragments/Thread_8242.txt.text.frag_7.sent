you didn't specify the exact model numbers of your equipment, but you did give enough to tell that these two devices will never connect at anything above 54mbps. the ap contains an atheros superg chipset and the usb adapter has an airgo true mimo chipset inside and they don't have any common transmission rates above the standard 802.11g 
54mbps rate. 
sorry, but the two devices either both need to be 108mbps super g or both 240 rangemax devices to connect at higher speeds.
