for two systems. 
basically if you are stuck with that memory [although you really don't have much], there simply are no new mobos of any worth available for cpu'/chipset that still use that.. really think that you should start with a new mid size atx case. 
for cost saving go to ddr, thus you really then have no choice but to go to a socket 939 and the best amd 64 that you can afford. 
all of the mobos for intel p4's, of any merit that are available will be for ddr2 you will want to run memory in dual channel so buy the ddr in pairs so that you can use dual channel. 
two 256 mb sticks will show as 512 mb regardless whether you are single or dual channel, however in dual channel mode the memory bandwidth is doubled. 
if you can afford a pair of 512 ddr 40 [pc3200} that would make a nice system. 
check prices at newegg, they even sell some crucial and mushkin memory sticks at lower price than crucial or mushkin. 
they have a huge selection of cases. 
most mobos will have dual channel capability and have four memory slots and can take 4 gb [however xp only will actually use 3 gb]
