bits is used for transmission speed, bytes is used for connect speed. 
since all analog data; dial-up, dsl, and cable use an analog signal, yes virginia, these are analog signals, their connect speed is measured in bytes. 
reason being is that for analog data there is no timing signal for synchronization. 
each 8 bit byte will have a start bit and a stop bit designating the beginning and end of a word/byte. 
this is called asynchronous data transmission - no timing sdignal. 
this gives a total of 10 bits per byte. 
fully digital data signals have a timing clock running at 1.544 mhz or multiples thereof. 
thus it will have only 8 bits per byte.
