ok, i'll give those steps a go. 
too bad about the go back, it had saved me on a few occasions and i will miss the peace of mind it had given me. 
i haven't re enabled the os's &quot;system restore&quot; should i? as far as i have been able to gather, it's a limited way of safetying your machine and no where as complete as go back was. 
oh well. 
here i go! thank you again, cross your fingers!
