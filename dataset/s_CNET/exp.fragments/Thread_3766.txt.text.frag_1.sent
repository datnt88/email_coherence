hello members! 
i would like to view broadband tv from my laptop on my tv. my tv is pc/tv compatable. 
however, do still need the reciever form my dish network? 
i want to get rid of it d/t increase price. 
also, one tv/pc supports hdmi/vga/dvi/s-video (viewsonic). 
tv #2 supports rgb video output & rs-232 connector. 
what cables do i need for each tv? 
do i require the dish reciever for the broadband? 
i'm so confused. 
i appreciate your help thx
