i've just purchased an intel d865 glclk mobo and want to fit it with some good quality ddr. 
i have looked at the geil golden dragon and was quite impressed but i would like something to compare it to before i make a decision. the board has four dimm sockets and supports the following memory features: 2.6 v (only) 184-pin ddr sdram dimms with gold-plated contacts unbuffered, single-sided or double-sided dimms with the following restriction: double-sided dimms with x16 organization are not supported 4 gb maximum total system memory minimum total system memory: 64 mb non-ecc dimms serial presence detect ddr400, ddr333, and ddr266 sdram dimms
