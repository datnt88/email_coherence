why can't i get internet?!? i'm living in a dorm, and i'm trying to use my roommates internet (we're sharing the cost). 
anyway, my vista computer shows that it is connected to the router (and i can see other computer's on the network sometimes). 
however, i can't get internet, but my roommate can get internet both wirelessly and not. 
even when he's not connected to the internet at all, i still don't get internet. 
yet when i connect to the router via a cable, i do get internet. 
what is wrong? 
here is some information on the wireless network connection status: ipv4 connectivity: local ipv6 connectivity: limited media state: enabled ssid: trev dsl i'm pretty sure i have everything enabled on my computer that needs to be, because i can get internet on a different router. 
if you could help me, that would be really nice (currently, i'm stealing one bar of signal from an unknown neighbor and it's really inconvenient...). 
again, this is a vista computer (yea, i know...) so try to use instructions for the vista operating system, not xp. p.s. i've made the network private, so it doesn't really have to do with anything like that i think... but i don't really know. 
also, i would have just called the company, but the warranty has expired... so, i'm stuck
