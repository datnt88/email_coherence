you'll need to open the tower to get the motherboard model number off it. 
if you down load this software it might give you the name of the manufacturer: esupport also has a free driver scanner to see if your drivers are up to date. 
do the scan, if there &quot;not up to date&quot; you can search them out for yourself or pay for there service to do it for you. 
cnet now has a service like this but the name escapes me at the moment. 
here's esupports link: esupport is also a major bios supplier for hp. are your bios current? 
this might also be the problem. 
if the drivers don't work for you then i think your board is shot. 
no, link here is an ad. that's all i have for you.
