stupid me, i pulled my heat sink/fan assembly off my processor (p4 2.0ghz) to clean the heat sink. 
after pulling it off, i realized i had to reattach it to the pc. i cleaned off the old thermopaste, i think it was a pad that had been tapped onto the hs. i cleaned the processor too. 
i applied some arctic silver brand paste and reassembled. 
i turned the pc on, it fired up then shut down after about 15 seconds. 
now, i turn it on and only the drives (2 hdds and 2 cds) and the processor fan fires up. the pc does not actually boot or generate any type of post messages or video. 
i removed the hs again to check it and found the paste had covered about 90% of the top of the processor. 
did i fry it? 
i pulled the processor off and looked at it, didn't see or smell anything unusual. 
i've tried the pulling the cmos with no change in problems. 
any ideas?
