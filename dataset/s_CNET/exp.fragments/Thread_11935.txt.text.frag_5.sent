i cannot say about the others. 
but i owned the asus transformer tf101 and i really liked it, the only reason i sent it back was because i found it cheaper online and i desided to wait for the asus transformer pad 300...tho i do not know if the 300 comes with gps. 
i didn't get the xoom because its the oldest of the tablets, the acer was really heavy and i read some bad reviews on it as far as video playback..plus the asus had the dock which the others didnt.
