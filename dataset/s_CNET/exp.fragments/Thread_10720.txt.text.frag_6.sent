did you try? i can't count the times where people want some guaranty from me. 
&quot; can you tell me how to access the post you are mentioning? 
&quot; the sticky post is in this forum, the top post today. 
just click on cnet forums: networking & wireless and there it is. 
&quot;also, i am not sure why i would be quadrupling the efforts to port forward both the dsl and the wifi. 
do i need to do more than what i have already done?&quot; because you have a double nat and need to forward twice and your hardware may not work. 
you have double the hardware and software at work here so 4 times the possibility of it not working.
