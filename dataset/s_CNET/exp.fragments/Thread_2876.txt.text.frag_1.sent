so, shipping my computer had some unexpected side effects, one of which is my cd-rw drive seems to be broken.. if i go into -any- program to burn a music or data cd or copy one.. it seems like it's working.. in fact, it 'completes' it and the cd pops out after it's 'done' but.. the cd is always empty but cannot be reused. 
i've tried with different cd types to no avail. the hardware is hooked up, and registers as working right. 
no new drivers or anything sooo... i'm pretty much screwed with that one, right? 
i'm okay with that as my other cd drive works and i don't use the r a whole lot. 
i wouldn't mind upgraded to a dvd drive anyway - i guess it would be a dvd writer so i'd still have the cd writing capabilities. 
i don't imagine this should be too hard. 
how do i find out if my motherboard can handle that? 
and what's compatible with my system? 
and finally, what's recommended? 
i've never had a dvd drive and so i totally have not caught up with the technology.
