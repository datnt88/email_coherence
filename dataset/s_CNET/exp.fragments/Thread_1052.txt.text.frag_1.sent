i've recently had a problem with my usb mouse. the cursor was locking, and after some time the same happened with my keyboard. 
so i decided to take my pc to a technician and he replaced my usb mouse with a serial mouse since the problem seemed to be with the usb ports. 
now my problem with this mouse is that it frequently acts very strangely in that right-click menus open suddenly without me having touched the mouse. 
also sometimes the cursor changes its position on the monitor, yet the mouse is not being moved. 
can anyone help me with this problem please? 
thanks.
