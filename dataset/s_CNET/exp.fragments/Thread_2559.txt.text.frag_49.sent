all the major vendors (hp/compaq, dell, gateway, emachines, sony, etc.) are proprietary. 
none of them are &quot;easy&quot; to work with...they &quot;all&quot; have limitations to what you can configure (especially in the bios where it is critical to how a system runs)..........emachines have crappy power supplies and alot of times allow for no upgrading..stay completely away from that junk even if they want to pay you to take one....it's not worth the price of painkillers............................all the major companies have the hardware components made to their specs................it's not that they are &quot;cheap&quot;, the components may run on different voltages/etc. 
than a normal consumer isn't trained to work with.......the big companies use discontinued/outdated components mixed with the latest and greatest..............the &quot;slowest&quot; piece of hardware in your system determines the systems &quot;top&quot; speed/efficiency/performance...............it doesn't do any good to have a 3.8g cpu, a 160g 8mb cache hdd with &quot;512mb of pc2100 ram&quot;....................the memory kills a system like this because it is way too slow........the same setup only the memory is pc2700 or higher, the same 3.8g cpu &quot;only&quot; the hdd is a 160g &quot;2mb&quot; cache..........there's another slowdown.....this is why it's very important to know how the components work together for best performance................it's not unusual for the manufacturers to slip a &quot;5400&quot; rpm hdd in.......that went out in desktops in the &quot;90's&quot;!!!!!!!!!.........it's impossible to purchase a decent enough machine for now and the near future for less than $500.00 unless there's one h**l of a sale somewhere...................most of the manufacturers don't put a big enough power supply in to withstand many upgrades.....sometimes there are not enough slots or the right kind............dells are fine if you buy business and stay business..........hp/compaq are okay but somewhat quirky.......gateway has been producing some really fine machines the past couple of years......as for monarch, systemax and others.............they aren't much different a lot of times...we've had hundreds and hundreds of these and other brands come in/out of the shop and you can't beat a custom built pc.....however, finding a competent builder is usually very tough......................and you &quot;can't&quot; build a better machine for the money than what's on the shelf generally........stop and think.........windows xp is ~ $150.00 by itself...what can you build for $350.00 that can compete unless &quot;you&quot; use really &quot;cheap&quot; parts?????????????????????????????????? it's tough to do............wholesale prices aren't that cheap.....warranty isn't lengthy either if you don't purchase &quot;retail&quot; parts...........tech support; good luck anywhere...........
