moving a drive from an internal ide to an external usb 2.0 case may find out that such moves are just not supported. 
prepare the drive where it is to stay and move forward. 
there are many older usb cases that don't support over 137gb drives. 
you may have such. 
i see them in the cheapest offerings.
