i sympathize with your problem. 
i also just built my new computer. 
i used a tsunami case and since it had a window on the side, it came with velcro and nylon ties. 
i found that tying off the power cables first, then the others was sort of ok. it can never be as neat as the old macintosh amplifiers. 
they were the best you could buy in the old days and they tied all the wires off with string and then sealed the box with tar to keep everything in place (the vacuum tubes,of course were on top.) frightening thought for a computer owner!
