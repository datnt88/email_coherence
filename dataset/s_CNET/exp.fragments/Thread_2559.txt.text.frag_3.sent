all you really need is a server. 
acer has several available. 
they include the keyboard and mouse. 
tiger direct has some killer prices with a four-payment plan. 
get the high-end athlon cpu and 2 gigs. 
since you are not a gamer, you can probably live with on-board graphix. 
if your going to edit dvds - be sure to get a video capture card or outboard device. 
i have an acer and 4 dells. 
they are all good. 
you don't necessarily need a media center setup, but i would recommend wndows xp professional as an operating system. 
some of the manufacturers are already offering vista as an option but (trust me) it's way to early to be using that. 
good luck - carry on.
