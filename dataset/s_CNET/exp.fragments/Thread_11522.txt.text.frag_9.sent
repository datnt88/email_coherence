thanks bob. 
i'll try that. 
i know that wd sent a cable with their 160 gb drive that required setting the jumpers. 
i don't know why the bios isn't recognizing the drive. 
it says the data cable is not connected. 
but it is and i have replaced it with another new one. 
i can't help but believe the deleting of everything on the hard drive has something to do with it. 
thanks
