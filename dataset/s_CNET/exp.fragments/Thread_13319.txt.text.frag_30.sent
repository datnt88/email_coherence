as a semi-professional photographer and way above average computer user myself, the powerpc g5 is a waaaay better chip from a technical standpoint than even the intel duo at its fastest clock speed. 
for one, these are 64-bit chips and with the front-side buses they support and addressable memory makes them second-to-none for cpu intensive tasks. 
also, not so much the bugs to be concerned about with the new macintels, but the fact that software runs on emulation currently via rosetta, and emulation is always slower than native instructions. 
in addition to which, bear in mind that some applications do not work under such settings -i.e., osx with emulation on the intel duo. 
now for the notebook, well that is an option i suppose but the one i use is my 40 gb ipod photo with the photo connector to download images if i use the full 2 gb on my cf card for my nikon d70. it is much cheaper to either invest in higher capacity meory cards for your camera or to go the ipod way.
