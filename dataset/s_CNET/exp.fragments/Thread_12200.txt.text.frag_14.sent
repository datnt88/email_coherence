guess i should have said something in my other post. 
yes, a 4x agp card is better than a pci card. 
agp 4x raw bus speed = 266 mhz (1066 mb/s) bandwidth dedicated to individual agp slot pci raw bus speed = 33 mhz (133 mb/s) bandwidth = shared by all pci devices, may starve them pci 2.2 = 133mb/sec agp 1.0 = 266mb/sec agp 2x = 533 mb/sec agp 4x = 1.06gb/sec agp 8x = 2.1 gb/sec i have a 4x agp video card running in one of my computers where the mobo is 1x, so the card is running at 1x without any problems. 
some old tests:
