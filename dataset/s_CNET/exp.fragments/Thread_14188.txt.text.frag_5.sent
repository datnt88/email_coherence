i will do that today and let you know. 
frankly i dont have much of hope as, this beeping sound comes even if i dont connect to the computer. 
the sound was not there earlier. 
it sounds like a sort of warning. 
in fact it comes again if i connect the drive to laptop. 
so its like whenever someone tries to connect to the hard disk, it gives this sound and some scratching sound and then everything goes dead (except the blue light on the drive)
