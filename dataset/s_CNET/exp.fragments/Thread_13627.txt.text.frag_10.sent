i have to admit; that i've never had any other manufacturers' motherboard in any of my (home-built) pc's, never had a problem (nor had to rma) any of their boards you might have a problem actually getting your hands on the new nvidia gpu's; i've read on many sites, that they're hard to come by (not unlike the amd high-end cards). 
if you have any concerns/ problems when it comes time to actually build your new pc, you know where to find me
