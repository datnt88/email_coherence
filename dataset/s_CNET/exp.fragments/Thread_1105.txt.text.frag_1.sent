hey there everyone! 
my wife and i recently moved from the u.s. to france and are now looking to get a multifunction printer/scanner to assist us with out work. 
since we are only here for two-years, we were hoping to get one that has a universal power supply, so that we can bring it back to the states with us. 
sadly, i may be using the wrong search criteria on the internet, since i cannot find any info on these. 
or, maybe they just don't exist. 
any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
