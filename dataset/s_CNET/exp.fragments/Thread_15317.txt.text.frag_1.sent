i added a ata pci 133 card w/o incedent. 
i then added a 200g harddrive to the pci card. 
i set the drive to master since it is the only one on that particular cable. 
i am unable to boot up the machine after adding the hard drive. 
my guess is that the machine is attempting to boot-up from this second hard drive. 
the drivewizard that came with the drive (seagate drive) only has information for adding the drive as a slave. 
any hints? 
also, on the start-up screen, though i hit &quot;f1&quot;, i do not go into system set-up. 
tia, greg
