case....get a mid tower. 
&quot;bling&quot; drives the price on these things.......how much 'bling' do you want? 
for me a 20 buck generic works fine.....your call. 
mobo......get an atx......not a micro atx. 
brand.....i doubt it makes much difference. 
look at the features of both and see if something jumps at you. 
gpu.....i see you can get a hd 7850 for about the same bucks. 
that would be my choice.
