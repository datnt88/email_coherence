i'll be brief. 
i have an emachine t 6216 with stock 300 watt psu. 
want to upgrade psu. 
found out through e machine tech support that my stock psu has a 90 mm fan. 
i was going to purchase a new psu with a 120 mm fan. 
now, i find many fans at tigerdirect with 80 mm fans. 
will an 80 mm fan work for me? 
will a 120 mm fan work for me? 
what's the difference? 
also, i do not have a sata drive, but an ide based hard drive, will a new psu include a cable for an ide drive? 
would love some closure on these questions. 
thanks so much in advance, richard
