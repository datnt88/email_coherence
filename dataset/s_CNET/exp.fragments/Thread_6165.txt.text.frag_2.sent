pci at 66mhz is for a 32bit pci bus or roughly 264 million bytes per second. 
there are web sites that cover this in gory detail so the average ata133 drive is all of 133 megabytes per second in a burst. the slow pci bus you write can burst at over 2x an ata drive and sata drives are not much faster. 
think this one over since usb 2.0 is just some 480 mega bits per second and that pales in comparison to both sata and pci speeds.
