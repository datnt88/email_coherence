after reading many reivews i decided on the l90d+, but i have one concern. 
a larger portion of the recent reviews describe a problem with vertical lines appearing on the right sides of the screen within one to three months of use. 
i am wondering if this situation has been corrected in the latest production line? 
thanks, drew
