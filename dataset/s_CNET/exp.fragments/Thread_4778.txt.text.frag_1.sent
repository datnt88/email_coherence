as the title implies, i am interested in setting up a wireless home network using a westell 6100 modem (verizon dsl...pppoe), a linksys wrt54g router/switch and several laptops (all windows xp os). 
i have tried setting this up a few times and have looked around other forums for answers but am still having problems. 
my questions then are.... 1) which is preferable - have the westell modem take care of the routing and let the linksys serve as a simple access point? 
or, bridge the modem and let the linksys do most of the work? 
are there in inherent advantages to pursuing one option over the other? 
2) pending the answer to my previous question, how would i go about executing (fill in the preferred choice from question #1)? 
keep in mind please that i have either tried both ways with little success or, simply misunderstood directions. 
in attempting to follow verizon's directions for bridging the modem and setting the linksys up to rout, i was successful until one of the very last steps. 
after setting the linksys to pppoe i clicked connected and received a message stating that i could not get an ip address from the pppoe server. 
i think i may have missed cloning the mac address (but which one do i clone.....the westell or the linksys and how do i do that?) i attemped to turn of the linksys routing to use it as a wireless access point (a la this suggestion - linksys customerhelp but i seem to be missing something. 
i disabled dhcp and am not sure what to set the static ip as...i'm not quite clear what they were saying about setting it on your subnet while making sure it is unique, outside your dchp server ip scope. 
thanks in advance for any assistance as well as for your patience if i've left anything off.
