thank god, i have managed to get back into bios and reset it to original state. 
but i need to add more ram. 
i have consulted the hand book that comes with the pc and it says that it should automatically set up the ram. 
i have put the correct ram in the slots and rebooted. 
but it will not start up. it beeps a few times then even the microsoft xp start up pages comes up, but then dissappears and nothing else happens. 
what can i do. 
i know the ram is correct as it out of identical computer. 
the motherboard is n2u400-a amd athlon (tm) xp 2000+ 1.54ghz
