kwkid sorry to confuse you. 
let me try to explain: my old pc was connected with an alcatel speedtouch usb. 
i had my ethernet card free to connect to 2 other computers. 
i had a crossover cable running from my pc to a us robotics broadband router placed in another room 20 yards away. 
from there 2 straight cables were connected to the other 2 computers. 
this setup worked fine. 
when needed i also could unplug the crosscable from my machine to connect a laptop. 
in the current situation my isp connected my new pc with a copperjet 810 lan connection. 
(the technician informed me that they were replacing all alcatels with copperjets) fine, but now my ethernet port needed for my network is taken. 
so all i want now is a free ethernet port to continue with what i was doing before. 
i was not sure if a second ethernet card would do the job, so i posted in the forum to hear from the experts. 
i hope you ain't confused anymore. 
i appreciate your help. 
regards leo
