i've just successfully installed a new linksys router and connected two computers. 
i also have a notebook computer that will use wireless to connect to the internet. 
how secure are my wireless connections to my router via the notebook and what keeps someone else (like a neighbor) from connecting to my router? is there a way to exclude unauthorized users? 
what do i need to do? 
thanks!
