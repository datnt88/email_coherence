just got off the phone with belkin. 
not an issue for me since the printer is in the same room as the router. 
i'll repurchase and try it next time i'm down there. 
excellent signal strength. 
only can hope it will retain a connection but for $40 its worth the risk for me. 
trying not to over buy for my needs.
