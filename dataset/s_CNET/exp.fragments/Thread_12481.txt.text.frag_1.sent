many people have reported not being able to get the mic to work on this card. 
me too! 
i am wondering if a way to combat this frustrating problem might be with a sound pod - i'm considering byterunner ua 580 (usb 5.1 channel audio adapter). 
anyone have any experience or advice regarding this? 
many thanks!
