consider yourself lucky that you have anything. 
i found some of the cheap flash drives not worth keeping after 1yr.(they die much sooner) they simply crap out. 
however, name brands do well and if you get a high quality one, then at least it should serve you until you're done with it. 
be aware that &quot;static/esd&quot; is very much part of the shorten life cycle of a flash drive, ground yourself or your flash drive becomes the flash point(no pun intended) to discharge static.
