hi lggiemo, before replacing the video card, i would try all software troubleshooting options. 
for instance, try updating your video driver. 
here is the latest from hp for your pc: also, what monitor do you have? 
you may need to install a new monitor driver or other monitor software. 
--although i am an hp employee, i am speaking for myself and not for hp.--
