hi, guys. 
i'm looking for a device that strengthens the wireless signals in the surrounding areas. 
i would like for my laptop to get stronger wifi signals from computers in the surrounding area. 
i've heard that this device is known as a wireless booster or hub? 
if not, please let me know what its called, and if possible, the best brand.
