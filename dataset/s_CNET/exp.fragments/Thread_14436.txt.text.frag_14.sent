hi there, i dont think setting up user names and passwords really matter, the network and workgroups you created are standards with xp for connection purposes only. 
i.e shared internet. 
if you want to acces files to and from different machines be they wireless or not, you have to share the folders, then right click your lan icon / open network connections right click then open properties. 
now you should see the name of your ethernet card and the services its running / allows. 
click install / protocols choose tcp ip version 6. you can also istall services qos packet shedule. 
you should be good to go now.
