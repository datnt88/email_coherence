depending on different computers, many automatically just switch the on board graphics to the new agp card in the bios without doing anything. 
if you have also tried disabling the on board graphics while the agp card was out and then putting the card in without results, then you may have a defective agp card. 
agp cards normally come with instructions and a disk. 
your mobo or computer instructions should also talk about the integrated/and agp enabling/disabling features. 
sorry i can't help further.
