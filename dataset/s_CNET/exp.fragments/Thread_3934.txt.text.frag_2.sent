i am using the hp 4890 scanner and when i want to enlarge a picture that i scan, i scan it and save it to a file in my pictures and then open it up in microsoft digital image 2006.i then change the picture size there and then print the picture. 
i think you can do the same with most photo editing programs. 
the only problem is if you take a small picture and try to blow it up too big the quality of the print goes down.
