on the ram vs. cpu question: before you even go there, try this -- set up a regular routine to delete *.tmp files, internet cached files and defrag the drive. the disk defragger included in w2k and later is a licensed version which is ok; you can buy the commercial version of diskkeeper which is even better. 
if you do a thorough defrag with no applications running once a week, you may find that you don't need a hardware upgrade at all. 
if you still want to do a hardware upgrade, there is no single answer to whether the cpu or ram will be the best answer in your particular case; the best way to approach this is to use the performance monitor tools to decide which element is the bottleneck, and decide from that which way will give you the most bang for your buck. 
there are several white papers discussing the ram and cpu counters to use, and how to interpret the results.
