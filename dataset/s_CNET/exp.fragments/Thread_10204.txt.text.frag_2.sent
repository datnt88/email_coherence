look at the apple/microsoft eco-system and you have your answer. 
some can't see it, some won't accept it. 
for now it appears to be 2 choices and the bb is a nice try but rim upset the developers so for third and maybe fourth place they really needed to try harder. 
but something in their dna or culture interfered. 
unless the bb is 99 bucks, i'd ignore it.
