i just bought a new graphics card and memory for my dell 8200 and i am beginning to think it may not work out. 
here is the stuff i bought: apollo geforce fx5500 256mb 128-bit ddr agp 4x/8x (2)simpletech 128mb 184-pin rdram (16bit) unbuffered pc 800 system memory i am upgrading from a geforce 3 ti 200 and 256 mb rdram. 
my questions are: will these fit in my computer? 
will my power supply handle it (250 watts)? 
my manual say my agp is 4x, and the system requiremnts for the card says it requires agp 8x, so is this incompatible, even though it says 4x/8x? i thought i had done enough research before i bought this stuff, but once i got it i got nervous and now i am not so sure. 
i am upgrading with the intention of seriously cranking up my hardcore gaming experience. 
thanks to anybody who knows whats up with these old rigs.
