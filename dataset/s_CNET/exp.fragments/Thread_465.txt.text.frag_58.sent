windows xp home edition, hp pavilion a 320n, system number dm168a-aba, serial number mxk 34500 mw. i don't know if you need any more than this, if you do then you would have to tell me where to find it, i am a computer illiterate, most problems are probably my own. the computer is strictly home use, i'm disabled so its pay my bills on line confer with my doctor recieve reports or results from test, appointments, look up medicines and supplements. 
nothing that i would think would harm it other than age. 
i have automatic security update but most of the time it doesn't work. 
it will show as being installed but its not there. 
it will be in my update history but not in my add/remove programs. 
i'm trying right now to install a 90 day trail for anti-virus. 
90 days is a long time for limited/fixed income. 
i get so far and get an error report. 
start over, another error. 
i don't have any idea what these errors are or why. 
i follow instructions so in my thinking it should be simple, no, doesn't happen. 
is it because the computer is too old or i'm too old and stupid. 
i don't know if you can help or not but maybe a couple of suggestions.
