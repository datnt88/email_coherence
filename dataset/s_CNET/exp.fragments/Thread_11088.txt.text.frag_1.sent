my gtx480 has recently passed on ( rip ). 
however, i need to get my pc up and running pretty soon. 
i don't really need an upgrade but i need something able to run at the same speeds or better than that of the 480. 
i do game and do some rendering. 
the catch: i need it for 200 or less. 
any help is appreciated. 
thanks!
