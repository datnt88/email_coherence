because inside a computer it has a case to take the brunt of the impact. 
folk that drive their copies down to one last copy on any single device tend to lose them all. 
if you have an old machine and use this for a backup copy, that's a good idea. 
but it's only the first line of defense. 
here i have our family photo collection on no less than 3 devices.
