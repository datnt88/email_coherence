dell has always been rated better than acer. 
i worked as a manger of a computer repair shop for a few years and acers were known for being very problematic, dells came in as well but were generally problems that were more easy to diagnose and repair. 
if i were you i would find an independent shop and talk to them about what you want the computer to do and specify each component. 
that way you can buy the best parts available on the market or the cheapest and have the say on each component. 
i have never owned a computer with a name on it and have had the best and fastest stuff money can buy. 
always stable. 
totally upgradeable, changeable with no proprietary crap to keep you from changing something if you want.i would at least look at this option. 
put the money where it is needed and save where it is not. 
but do buy a good quality brand motherboard like asus. 
that is all i ever use on hundreds of computers. 
they are quick, quality and moderatly priced. 
they claim to have the best motherboard in the world. 
personally i agree. 
i run a p5ld2 asus and it is awesome. 
no probs ever.
