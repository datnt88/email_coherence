try booting your machine, then pressing f8 before the machine boots into windows. 
choose the option &quot;start in ms-dos mode&quot;, then type in the letters &quot;fdisk&quot;. 
use that program to find if there is any space left (which there should be). 
make sure to enable &quot;large hard disk supoort. 
make new partitions to fill up the space, if need be.
