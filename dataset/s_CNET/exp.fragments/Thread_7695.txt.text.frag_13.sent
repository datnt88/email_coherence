1gb is max for hardware on the mobo, yes windows reconizes 3.5gb (32bit) but the hardware has limits also. 
but this no longer matters, mr. proffitt has swayed me into getting a new mobo, to get best of both worlds. 
i ordered a intel desktop board that supports agp, my fx 5700 ultra will work for now, it directly supports my p4 i have now, with overclocking abilities, and has support for 2gb of pc800 rdram, i have a 1gb kit of that laying around(4x 256mb) so i can just use that for now, rdram is expensive thoe but still way out performs my current ddr, and pc133, its on par with some lower ddr400 sticks, and yes i will update to the 7300gt (evga that is), so thanks for all of your help, exspecially mr. proffitt, this computer setup will do just fine until i can save up for my i7 extremem edition system. 
lol thanks, bigboy
