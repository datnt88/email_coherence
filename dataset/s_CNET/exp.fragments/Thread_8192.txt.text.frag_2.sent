do some research on toner cartridge cost and availability before you buy one. 
sounds to me as if you just need something basic. the brother 2140 would probably work, they are inexpensive and functional and the toner cost won't break you. 
rule of thumb on a toner cartridge (mono) is something over 2000 copies but it can vary depending upon the unit. 
some manufacturers offer two variations of toner cartridges, basic and full, quantity of toner in cartridge and the cost will reflect that. 
if you do a color laser the story changes they will be considerably more expensive to operate, especially if you have to replace a drum.
