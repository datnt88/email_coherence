i have tried to install office xp service pack 3 on my win 2000 machine and it always tells me the installation was unsuccessful. 
i have used the 17 mb package and the 54 mb and get the same thing. 
i checked the programs that come with the office programs and they all show that i have sp3 but the automatic update says i need to install it. 
can anyone help me with this? 
thanks in advance.
