i uninstalled this machine so i could fix my daughters x73, and when i clean uninstalled the x73 program and reinstalled the x1150 the scanner part refused to budge. 
i have unplugged, replugged, uninstalled and reinstalled. 
i have this problem into lexmark, but they have loads of problems before mine, so if anyone can help me, i would appreciate it. 
windows me 128 mgs ram thank you flora
