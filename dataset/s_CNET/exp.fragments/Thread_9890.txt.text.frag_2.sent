but that power supply is likely to have aged and can cause trouble if you push it harder than before. 
you can check the power connections to see if it can be re-used but i worry about old power supplies. 
they are not ageless. 
2. iffy. the i5 is a dual core with 4 threads, the older core 2 quad is a quad core with 4 threads so not a major uptick like a move to the usual i7. then again it's all about the apps. 
my i5 laptop and my old core 2 quad are fairly equal in transcoding video. 
3. think about what you are using the machine for. 
if it's a current 64 bit os, 8gb ram may hold off an upgrade for another year.
