can anyone suggest a good movie maker that will play a song in the intro all the way thur? 
i had roxio on my old computer, and it was great had no problems. 
i broke down a got the easy cd&dvd burning (roxio).....well guess you get what you pay for, i hated it, just a played short intro song, but even so it was a lame program, i uninstalled. 
window's movie maker just plays a short intro,about a verse and starts over. 
any other movie maker program anyone can suggest, don't know if i want to go back to using roxio products, the reviews are not to good, especially for vista users. 
any help would be appreciated.
