there is a setting in your video properties where you can select how much ram is allocated to video depending on the pc. you might right click the desktop, properties, settings tab, advanced. 
this will get you into your video card/drivers and you should be able to change the amount of ram used. 
you damn sure don't need 128 meg of ram for a laptop screen.
