is caused by the drive being placed in an external case (with its own electronics), being connected to the pc thru usb (sometimes it's perfect and others not), or being portable (susceptible to falling over or being dropped). 
even if the drive or the enclosure doesn't fail ... dropping the external hdd or tripping over ac power/usb cable causing the drive hit the deck ... running or not, can easily end it all. 
bottomline ... my first backup always goes to a separate internal hdd. 
and subsequently those backups ... mainly ghost images, are also copied to an external hdd. 
this method has served me very very well for years.
