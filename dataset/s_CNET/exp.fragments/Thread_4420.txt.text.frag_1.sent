hi... i am in the market for a new desktop, but am stymied at the array of products out there. 
my current computer is an old pentium, and though i need to keep price under control, i want a new desktop that won't be obsolete in a few years. 
i've looked at the zt brand from costco, and gateway, etc. and would like to keep price under $1000. 
i am thinking i need an intel processor, either the core i5 or i7, to make sure it is as up to date as i can get. 
am i correct? 
i want a fast, efficient, mid-range computer... can anyone recommend some specific computers?
