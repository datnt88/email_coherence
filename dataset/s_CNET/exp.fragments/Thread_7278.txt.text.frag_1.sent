i have a desktop computer with linksys wireless usb adapter plugged in. 
sometimes when i try to get on the internet and cannot , i click the notification symbol and it is scanning. 
i tried calling them and i was put on hold and tried their website but had to register for their forums and got no answer. 
sometimes it scans for more than an hour sometimes less. 
why is it scanning?it 
does not always scan i can just access the internet with ease. 
rebooting does not help. 
thanks!
