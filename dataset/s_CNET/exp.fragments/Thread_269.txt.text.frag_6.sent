if you add memory, you should have no problem running xp on the desktop. 
i have an old dell xps r400 with a 400 mhz p2 and only 128mb of ram running xp pro just fine. 
i would definitely recommend xp pro over xp home, as it seems to be a more stable system if you can afford the extra $70 or so. 
(actually, i bought this whole system which included xp pro and office xp on cdroms for around $180 on ebay. 
i couldn't buy the software alone for that amount anywhere else.) this system is networked with another 400 mhz p2 running win98se and a wi-fi dell inspiron 8200 running xp pro via a netgear wireless router. 
if you already have a wireless router, then adding an ethernet card to your p2 system would be cost effective. 
if you don't have the wireless router, you could get a wireless adapter for the desktop and use a peer-to-peer wireless network with the desktop acting as your internet gateway for the hp laptop. 
incidentally, my internet downloads on the 400 mhz xp pro system run 3 to 4 times faster than the same downloads on the 400 mhz win98 system (via a toshiba cable modem attached to the router.) apparently, xp pro is more optimized for networking than win98se. 
hope that helps you sir golfsalot.
