the cd that came with the modem/gateway contains the installation manual. 
it is an amazing 41 pages long and, i think, personally written by the techs at 3btech. 
i followed all the instructions. 
(((yes my laptop has built in wifi and a switch on the front to enable/disable. the switch is enabled and i can usually see 2-4 other networks.))) 
my laptop is a toshiba satallite a215, amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core tk-57 1.9 ghz, 2 gb ram, vista home sp2. 
and before i go further, i will say that i am a computer expert with very little knowledge of networking but a tad bit of experience with it...trial and error type stuff mostly. 
when i go to &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; i am redirected to &quot; and there i log into my modem. 
i find myself at the home page. 
across the top are tabs labeled home, wizard, setup, advanced, wireless, tools, status, and help. 
i have played around with some settings under most of these to try and &quot;turn on&quot; the wireless and haven't gotten anywhere. 
the home tab displays basic status information. 
for this post i will qoute what i currently see. 
system uptime: 09 hours 58 minutes dsl status: connected dsl speed: 512/3008kbps wireless rf: disabled ethernet: connected software version: 3.6.0c_2n00 
ssid: asusmatt at the bottom there is two buttons &quot;log out&quot; and &quot;refresh&quot; per the instructions in the included manual and of my isp's (at&t) particular settings, i went to wizard. 
at the top, under the tabs is the heading: ppoe connection setup protocal: pppoe vpi: 0 vci: 35 username: fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads password: fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads on demand: (not selected) idle timeout: (greyed out and not an option) under this is another section/heading labeled wireless setup ssid: asusmatt channel b/g: 7 at the bottom are the options to &quot;log out&quot; or &quot;next&quot; when i click &quot;next&quot; the new screen is the warning that i am about to make permanent changes to the system and that if i continue it will be restarted. 
obviously, i saved and restarted and was online in seconds through ethernet. 
the next tab is setup where i have: (heading) lan setup lan configuration ethernet switch (heading) wan setup new connection modem (followed by a green light) wizard gamer log out the first thing i did was go to new connection because there wasn't clear instructions concerning the wireless feature in the manual. 
...i will continue in a minute...
