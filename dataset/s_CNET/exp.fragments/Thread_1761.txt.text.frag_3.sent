the keyboard problem doesn't occur if i use a usb keyboard instead of a ps/2. 
i removed the optical drives, floppy disk and pci cards. 
i left only the sata disk and pcie video card. the keyboard problem didn't occur then. 
but the onboard nic problem didn't change. 
the psu is a 5 year old one that came with the aopen case. 
there doesn't seem to be something physically wrong with the motherboard, at least visually. 
i'm going to look for a decent psu and then see what happens.
