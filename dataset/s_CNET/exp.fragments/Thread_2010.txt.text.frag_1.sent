i have an old computer, amd xp at 1.1mhz. 
60gb hd. i guess it's about 3 years old, maybe more. 
i have run w2000 from the gitgo. 
sometimes it runs slow and i think it's time to reinstall windows. 
i have the original w2000 disks. 
i would like to copy all pertinent information. 
programs are no problem since i have all original disks. 
my problem is with things like passwords saved, email messages saved, favorites etc. my data files, like excell spreadsheets i have created are no problem since i am able to save those to cd. my problem is i don't know exactly what else to save and how. 
for example, i don't know the location for my favorites that i use when i'm on the web. 
i am using ie, latest version. 
lastly, should i consider just junking this computer and getting a new p4? i would still need to know how to copy pertinent information. 
thanks
