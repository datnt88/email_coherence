if don't want to spend too much money, the intel pro 3945 is a wireless-a/b/g adapter, so you don't need to purchase a wireless network adapter. 
any plain wireless-g (or a/g) router will work with that network adapter. 
you can get one for as little as usd$30. 
stick with major brands like netgear, d-link, and linksys.
