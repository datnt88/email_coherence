something's got a hold of the registry. 
clean the system out with a registry cleaner, spyware remover, adware and check for virus. the only other thing i can think of would be to check the spindle speed of the drive. 
but i doubt that to be the problem. 
also, check with seagate tech support and ask them if there are issues of the type you describe. 
and life goes on... jack
