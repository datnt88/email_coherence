i'm a software guy, i have a number of clients with swim schools. 
the pool water's 32-34 c ( &gt;90f), so the environment's both hot and humid. 
plus there's the hint of chlorine and/or salt in the air. 
regular pcs don't last long in this environment. 
many have leased premises, so air conditioning not an option (besides hot/cold health issues). 
ambient air in summer in mid to high 30s for many (australia). 
can you advise us on hardware & peripherals that might be effective as well as affordable?
