xp has severe limitations of which some are removed as you apply service packs. 
then xp has limitations on file systems and how big the memory stick or more. 
your post lacks detail so as it stands it could be the basic issues of xp or if the drive letter shows up and you look at the files with explorer the other big issue but all i can ask is you keep writing.
