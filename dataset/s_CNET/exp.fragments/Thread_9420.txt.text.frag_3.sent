some of these cameras are a pain they want you to buy software upgrades so you can remotely monitor them. 
if the instruction say it will work remotely as bob suggested use the dmz option to start since it will map all ports to the camera. 
if you do not have to run any special software ie you can use just the browser odds are pretty good you can get it to work the ones that use special software pretty much are building vpn tunnels between a pc in your house and your remote pc. the remote pc uses your home pc to view the camera. 
make sure if this is what you are using that you have the firewall on the home pc set to allow this, generally incoming sessions are blocked by most firewalls.
