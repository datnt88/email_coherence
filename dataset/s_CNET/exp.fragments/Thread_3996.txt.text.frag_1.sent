a co-worker of mine is having problems with a noisy hard drive. 
the hd appears to be &quot;working&quot; (hd light flashing along with the noisy &quot;clicking&quot; coming from the hd itself), but it will do this continuously, even when she is not using her computer. 
she is running winxp. the only thing i've found on the matter so far is that the hd is preparing to crash, but this machine is new (about 2 months old) and i have read that crashing is a problem of older noisy drives. 
what could or would be causing the noise? 
thanks in advance for your help.
