it's very similar so i'll guess at the answers. 
1.) has anyone used the enlosure above?(if 
you have see questions 2, 3, 4, and 5). 
yes. 
just not me. 
2.) does it heat up? 
absolutely. the drive emits about 20 watts so it will heat up. 
that's quite normal and expected. 
3.) does the drive stay in tight? the unit i saw was fine. 
but we used the mounting screws. 
can you explain why this is a concern? 
4.) does it have any heat problems? the one i saw was working so between that and my unit i'll write that as long as the fan works, no. 5.) is the enclosure loud/noisy? 
how good is your hearing? 
6.) has anyone tried macally enclosure? 
they have a new sata ii enclosure with no fan. 
for 3.5 inch drives the only case i'd look at without a fan so far is the &quot;metal gear box&quot; (google.com) 
it's construction helps get the heat out. 
7.) in the specification of some enclosure, it says it is aluminum so no fan is needed. 
any opinions/facts? 
do i need a fan for the drive i'm getting even though it states in the drives's description that it has cool and quiet operation? 
this question is telling. 
i take it you had a bum unit sometime? 
8.) any opinions on kingwin night hawk enclosures? 
no. 9.)any recommendation on a brand name enclosure that has sata i and ii, a fan, quiet, fast, good chipset? 
just one question. 
why would a drive enclosure need a chipset if i connect with sata? 
unless you need to connect with usb 2. hope this helps, bob
