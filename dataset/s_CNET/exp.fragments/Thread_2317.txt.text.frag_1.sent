i just sold me house, finally got some cash to build my dream system. 
of course i want it all. 
great gaming, and great video editing. 
what should i go with? 
i'm even up in the air about athlon vs p4. i read maximum pc and they area praising the amd stuff right now and suggest waiting for the new dual core chips from intel to come out. 
i've always had intel inside so i'm somewhat biased.
