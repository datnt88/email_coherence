i have 2 desktop computers in the house, one with win xp and a much older one with win 95. the win 95 maybe too old now for internet use but i still use it from time to time for word processing. 
lately i've been leaving the older computer on all night rather than do a shut down each night and restart the next day. the computer with win 95 is in my bedroom so during the night if i wake up i can see the screen saver is still on. 
this computer doesn't fade to black like the win xp one does. 
for the last 2 nights during the night when i would wake up i noticed that the monitor was totally black, no screen saver. 
i got up last night to check, my monitor's power button was still on and was blinking but the computer itself was off as if it had been turned off. 
i replaced the computer's original power supply a few years ago with a new one. 
could the power supply in the win 95 computer now be starting to play out? 
i know the computer is old but what could cause the computer to turn off? 
there have not been any power interuptions during the last 2 nights either. 
could the second power supply which i had installed a few years ago be what's causing the desktop to shut itself down?
