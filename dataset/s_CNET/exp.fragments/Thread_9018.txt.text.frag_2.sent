when i see bitlocker failures i turn to drivesavers.com. 
i already know that msft's answer is to format it and restore from backup. 
i'm going to assume you read how to install the certificate and this reinstall of windows is complete. 
that is, i find many to forget to install all the drivers and helper apps today.
