hmm. well he did dust off the fan and stuff and opened the casing and did the air thing. 
but he said the fan/heatsink was fine, the motherboard itself is bad? 
i'm just wondering, when replacing a motherboard, can things go wrong? 
i don't mind purchasing a new one and finding a good technician to do it for me but i just want to know of the possible things that might go wrong... thanks bob for your input.
