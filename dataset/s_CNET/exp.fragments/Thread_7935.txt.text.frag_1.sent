this may be a common problem so hopefully there is some advice out there for me. 
i recently bought a seagate 40gb 2.0 usb external hard drive to use on my laptop for saving audio files. 
it says that it is plug and play and does not require anything but xp to find the driver. 
my setup is not top notch but will do. 
piii, 512mb ram, and i added a pcmcia usb 2.0 cardbus to upgrade from the 1.1 in the back of the laptop. 
when i first plugged the ext. 
drive in i got a &quot;this device is not working properly&quot; meassge but it recognized it. 
then when i went to investigate in the device manager it was there with the yellow exclamation point and said that the drivers weren't installed. 
so i updated the drivers but the ones installed were the best for the device. 
when i went back a page to the properties it said &quot;this device cannot start - code 10&quot;. 
so that was/is(?) the problem to be solved. 
i tried to restart and try again. the drive won't even be recognized now unless i put it in the slow 1.1 usb and not the 2.0. 
i still get the same messages when i look at the properties in the device manager too. the 2.0 still won't recognize it as it did the first time i plugged it in. 
i don't think it's a power problem. the pcmcia is powered to 5vdc like it should be and it comes with a power cord to plug it in the 1.1 slot for extra juice if you need it and according to the hard drive i do not. 
i also tried plugging it into the wall using another power cord. 
no luck. 
also tried it on another computer that only had the 1.1 an it recognized it but same device properties. 
sorry for the manifesto but i'd really like to get this fixed. 
any advice?
