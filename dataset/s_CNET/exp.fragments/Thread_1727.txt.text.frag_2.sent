i read a report a while back where someone had done a test of 5400 vs 7200. 
in their test they did not see much of a diff. 
yes 7200 was slightly better. 
where they did see a big diff was in cache size. 
bigger is better. 
so if your looking to squeeze out all the juice get a 7200 unit with the biggest cache you can find/afford
