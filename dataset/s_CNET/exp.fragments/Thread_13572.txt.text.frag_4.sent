software doesn't kill h/w unless it strangles it so bad, it appears so. 
as any new os before, vista is plagued by compatibility and/or device issues(drivers). 
one reason as always, new is better as it in all likelyhood they will work. 
even then, some wrinkles always are present and need ironing out. 
welcome to the new os and the muddling steps to correct them. 
you wonder why any ms product takes so long to &quot;finally&quot; get released, you're experiencing why. 
remember, xp was much like this when it got pushed out, so wait and many an issue will be resolved but not on your time table.
