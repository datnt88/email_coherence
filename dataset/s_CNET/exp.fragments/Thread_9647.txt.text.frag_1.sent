i have a hitachi external hard drive that worked fine one morning and stopped working when i came back from college. it simply does not power on at all, as if the power cable is not even connected. 
i have tried it on two different computers the unit is definitely not receiving power so my question is, would buying a new enclosure save my data? 
i use my external hard drive to stream music and video from my nintendo wii and it's imperative that i save it. 
a new enclosure would have to conform to the specs of 3.5&quot; and 2tb. 
i can't afford data recovery and i want to save my approaching 1tb worth of content. 
this is it and thanks for any help i've had trouble finding answers.
