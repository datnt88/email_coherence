it's refurbished (joy systems) - so i'm not sure that the components are original - it could actually be 'rebuilt' - with some other components but this was the description: lenovo ibm thinkcentre m55e desktop pc - intel dual-core 1.6ghz, 2gb ddr2, 80gb hdd, dvd-rom, windows 7 home premium 32-bit, also - won't buy from newegg anymore - nothing but headaches with ups lost shipment . 
. . 
but found this at tigerdirect: looks very similar and heck of a deal .
