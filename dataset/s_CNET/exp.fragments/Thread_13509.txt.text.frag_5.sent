would &quot;balancing&quot; mean anything if i have been running great since 2009? 
i have only made the following changes: 1. better fan for cpu 2. added a 3tb hd 3. changed the fan on the 3tb hd two times 4. had the dvd drive replaced on a warrenty issue the only things that were added new to the psu was the 3tb hd and the its fan. 
everything was going great. then one day the computer turned its self on from a standby state then shut down completely. 
since that day, it has been nothing but problems. 
i can't even identify the problem correctly to be able to identify the solution. 
balancing the psu is a new solution, so i will try that.
