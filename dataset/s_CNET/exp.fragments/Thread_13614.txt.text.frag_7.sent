both routers are connected to the same switch, so doesn't that make it a lan? 
no. since the usual setup is to plug the routers wan port to the other lan, network address translation and more is in play. 
so no, not supposed to work. 
-&gt; what sort of class is this that doesn't cover how to determine what a lan is? 
have class content and quality sunk so low that they don't cover a basic item like this? i know the issue of microsoft shares outside a lan is a stumper for the newbies but they catch on fast.
