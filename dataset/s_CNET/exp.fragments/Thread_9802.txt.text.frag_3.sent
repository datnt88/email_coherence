thanks for your reply bob. 
while your suggestion makes sense, our it department's policy is not to get involved where it doesn't involve a connection to the company. 
currently, i can successfully connect through vpn so there ends the extent of their responsibility. 
my problem is making my home network work without vpn involvement. 
if you do have any suggestions re. settings, i would treat them with care, carefully noting any previous settings that i may have had to change. 
allowing me to be able to reinstate settings if neccessary . 
thx. 
again.....rs
