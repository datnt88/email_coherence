hi everybody out there. 
i have a question. 
can i upgrade the dell e521 to a geforce 9500gt from the onboard crappy graphics? the dell forums says its absolutely ok and the power supply will handle the card. the card needs a min of 350w with 18a on +12v rails. 
but the dell supply is 305w nd has 18a on the 12v rails. is it possible? 
or should i settle for a 8600gt? 
pls i need ur help thank u!
