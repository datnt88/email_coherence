the wireless connection disappeared around noon yesterday, so i thought i'd go to one of the library branches to use their wireless. 
five hair-pulling hours later, i still could not connect to it, even though there were people with laptops all around me connecting without a problem. 
unfortunately, the library workers cannot help, even though they offer wireless use to the public. 
they claim they cannot afford the bucks to hire help people who are comptetent to help people use technology they provide!! i suppose they're telling the truth but it is infuriating, to say the least...
