i use 10.6.2 os. where do i turn on system wide spell checker? 
there is some sort of spell checker running in most applications, so i suspect it is on. 
however, for some reason, in many cases where a character is missing, the computer does not report it as a misspelled word. 
anyway, thanks for your help. 
i tried filming from the front, but could not get a good camera angle. 
i'm thinking maybe i need another person to film as i type, moving the camera as needed. 
if i am physically missing this many keys, i may need my brain jump started. 
typing this simple passage above, i had to insert four missing characters. 
i am perplexed. 
btw, i am a 53 year old man, educated, and a writer. 
just in case someone might think i'm 18 and really have not typed that much. 
two years ago i went to an apple store and had someone watch me and he said i was hitting the keys, even when charters did not appear. 
he thought i typed too hard, but as an ex computer tech, i cannot see how that would matter. 
i try not to type too hard.
