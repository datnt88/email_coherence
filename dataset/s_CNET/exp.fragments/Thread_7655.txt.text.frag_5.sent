i agree with the suggestion of a kodak all in one, i bought the esp7 and love it. 
i had canon ink jet printers previously and my son got a hp with his laptop, ink for the hp all in one brand is very expensive and when the ink ran out he stopped using it, the previous canon's were very expensive for ink too. 
i bought an inexpensive brother laser for b&w and the kodak esp for anything color and also printing double sided. 
am very happy with both my kodak and brother.
