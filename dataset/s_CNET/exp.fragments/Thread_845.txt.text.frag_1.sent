after leaving it run for a few minutes and then performing a cold restart (need to stop doing that i know) the system will boot up properly. 
it isn't the my display as i've tried with a selection of others (tfts and crts). 
i then thought that there may have been too much of a strain on the psu, so disconnected 2 of the fans plus all of the drives, but am still having the same problem. 
i suspect that it may be a loose connection somewhere, which is solved when the system heats up and connections expand - but i could be wrong. 
as a last resort i will probably disconnect and reinstall everything, but before i do i'd most appreciate any help from anyone who may have had a similar problem or may have a theory about a possible cause. 
thanks in advance harinder
