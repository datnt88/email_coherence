if you can't even contact a lawyer to help you in this matter, your services are very lacking. 
afterall, you are talking about the future of your/the company and to think you believe ssn# maybe present just doesn't bode well for you. 
all data whether old or new becomes a matter for destruction because it data. 
sound funny but value is always attached to data and protection key to safeguard it. 
if safeguard is nothing more than storage, then somewhere in your lease/contract should be the handling of it when the client is no longer able to pay, doesn't release you from it &quot;safe keeping&quot;. 
in most cases, destruction is likely. 
it doesn't matter if you';re a 3rd party or 4th, etc., somewhere the data has to be deleted at least in a proper world, imho.
