the sonata has a 120mm fan and very good airflow. 
you can add a front 80mm fan if you want but it really won't be necessary for your build. 
here are some video card choices. 
geforce 8600gt, 256mb, $96 (before $20 rebate): geforce 8600gts, 256mb, $110 (before $20 rebate): geforce 9600gt, 512mb, $181: the 9600gt requires a 500w power supply, but your antec 450w will be fine.
