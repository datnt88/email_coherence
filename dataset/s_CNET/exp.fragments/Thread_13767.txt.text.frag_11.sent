i have the same drive, toshiba dvd-rom sd-r2212 in my fujitsu laptop (come to think of it, why does fujitsu use a toshiba drive in their computers?), and it conked out suddenly on me. it plays audio-cds but doesnt even recognize dvds anymore. 
so has anyone found a solution to this? or, i have to simply junk this and try to get an external dvd player or what?
