i am not a gamer just need an excellent system that will last for a number of years with good technical help (us preferrably as i live in the us). 
i have a gateway and a dell presently and am planning to replace gateway due to age (p233). 
would you recommend athlon or pentium d processor? 
what is the pentium vista and will it be compatible with all xp programs or will it be like me? 
do i need a 8 mb cache memory minimum? 
do i need dual channel memory and how do i recognize that it is dual channel if looking at the specs? 
how do i know if a system has 64-128 dedicated memory to the video card by looking at the specs and is this necessary? 
what type of memory is the best in the system? 
do i need the x16 express slot and what does it do? 
how do i tell if the seek time has a low number by looking at the specs? 
i know that the lower the number, the faster the system. 
last question, how do i know if the raid motherboard withe pci express supports serial ata hard drive. 
i gathered all this infor from cnet reviews so now i need some expert advice. 
should i purchase off the shelf or have a system built? 
i want to stay below 1k with monitor if possible as prices have really dropped. 
i know that i need a minimum of 1 ghbyt memory but 2 is preferrable but all the other stuff, i need advice from experts. 
please help.
