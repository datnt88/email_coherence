tomorrow evening (cannot do it this evening), i will unplug the modem for my isp (btw, my connection is a sat. 
connection, and the modem is supposed to act as a router itself, do not know if that could cause an issue or not) from the router and disable all the firewalls on all the computers to make absolutely sure that the firewalls are not causing this. 
lets hope nobody wants to put a logic bomb in before it take it off . 
as far as the naming issue, should i try making up a new workgroup to put all the computers under?
