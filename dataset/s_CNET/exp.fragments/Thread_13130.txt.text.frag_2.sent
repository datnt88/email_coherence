i bought a two gig sandisk and it came with all that junk on it. 
a visit to the sandisk site found the directions to remove the crap and format it. 
now it's just like a two gig external drive. 
when you plug it in it'll show up like any other drive. 
just right click and choose format. 
vista compatable? 
don't know. 
vista is still broken.
