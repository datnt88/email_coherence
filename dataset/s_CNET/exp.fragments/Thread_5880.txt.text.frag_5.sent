already downloaded and installed, but without the video card in the slot, they are not active. 
still put video card in slot, no video, and yes i have the monitor plugged into the pci video card or the onboard video (apg) and no video signal, but as soon as i remove the pci video card i get signal over the onboard video (apg). 
i only have 1 pci slot.
