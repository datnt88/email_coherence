i got screwed after i purchased mine. 
cd drive failed 2 days later. 
dell's outsourced support is indeed a joke, not only they don't speak english, they are generally inept and extremely rude. 
i've been hung upon numerouse times just to get an rma to return the cd drive. 
i can't wait for class action lawsuit to end this bs once and for all.
