it's a very good question. 
i have just purchased a top of the range canon all-in-one printer and the integrated software will not allow me to use generic inks. 
it will also record any instances of me doing so and void any warranty. 
canon tell me that generic inks are inferior and can damage the print head. 
i am not prepared to risk it because the printer is very pricey. 
if, however you have a cheaper printer, i would certainly take the risk as the money saved over time would more than compensate if the printer ultimately needed replacing.
