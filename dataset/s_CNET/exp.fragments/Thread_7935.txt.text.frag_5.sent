you may be right about it being defective but blank is what i want. 
i bought it new. 
maybe it needs formatting but a) i can't access it to do so (even though it comes up as &quot;usb mass storage device&quot;) and b) it's supposed to be plug and play. 
i really appreciate your help. 
i'll give it a little more tweaking before i return it.
