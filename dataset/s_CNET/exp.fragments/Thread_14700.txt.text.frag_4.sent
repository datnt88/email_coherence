you can't imagine the hoops i see our software jump through all because the cpu didn't do 64 bit integer math. 
but for 99.9999% of users at this time that does not mean the end of 32-bit. 
in fact, my pda is 16 bit. 
since os and such are still available for 8 bitters today, you may have to alter your question a bit to exclude non-mac or pcs in general.
