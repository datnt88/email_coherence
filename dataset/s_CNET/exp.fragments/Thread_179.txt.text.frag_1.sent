my old laptop caught on fire and i purchased a hd enclosure to move the documents/files from the old hd to my new computer. 
when i click on the files it says i don't have permission to access them. 
i've tried to understand how to change permissions over to the new computer, but it's not working. 
i'm using windows 7 on the new computer and windows xp on the old one. 
can someone guide me through the process?? karen
