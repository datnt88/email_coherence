did you try a shorter cord from the dsl modem to the wall as noted in that other discussion? 
about the hijackthis log. 
it's not for everyone and while i really like what it shows it is advanced skill to read it. 
i want to be humble here and write i do know a bit about this but am not as expert as those that do this all the time. 
example at again, while i do read such things, it's usually only to point out the obvious items. 
even you could run that tool and see if any item is left over from norton, mcafee and the like. 
usually easy to spot. 
try it. 
but ask others about this (see the link in this post!!!) before you delete it.
