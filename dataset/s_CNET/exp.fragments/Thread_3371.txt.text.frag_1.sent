compaq presario sr2020nx. 
the last time it worked it made sounds as if it were working hard to cool down. 
i opened it, and it was really dusty. 
now when i start up it does nothing, nothing on the monitor, all the sounds are there (processor fan, hd, psu fan) the processor light on the front stays on steady, but i don't hear it working. 
another thing i find odd is that now after normal power down when i unplug it, then plug it back in, i do not have to hit the power button, it powers up as soon as i plug it in. is the computer wasted? 
(yes, i cleaned the dust out) what are your thoughts? 
thanks in advance for any ideas.
