i use a brother b&w laser for general printing and tends to last me 3/4 years then buy a new one for $90. 
with inkjet have found every time have tried &quot;other brand&quot; have not got the same usage or they leaked and at my work saw a whole printer wrecked when somebody did a refill kit. 
i stick to the canon brand and find it much safer.
