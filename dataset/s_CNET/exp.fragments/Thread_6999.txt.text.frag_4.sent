before i opened my wallet i would look into free stuff like finding the proper mobo and vid drivers that mated to the os i was using and gave me the best perf. 
don't assume the newest drivers are best, you must test. 
i don't know what type of vid perf your looking for but i suspect that 800cpu and 100memory are going to be a problem.
