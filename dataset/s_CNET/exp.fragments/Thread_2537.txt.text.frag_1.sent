i share my internet connection with my roommate who is very tech savvy. 
i found out yesterday that he has been hacking into my gmail account and reading my emails. 
i didn't think it was quite possible and i'm very surprised. 
he manages the internet connection and has full access/control over it. 
my question is what can i do to prevent him from accessing my information? 
does this mean he has my banking and credit card login information as well? 
i thought those sites are safe and can't be hacked into. 
desperately need help. 
what can i do from preventing this. 
i have no privacy in my own house?? thanks in advance. 
please help.
