i would suggest you try some isolation test. 
i do not think your mobo comes with integrated graphics, so lets say a cheap $50 ati card will do or borrow one from a friend. 
swapping out your 8800 this way will pinpoint your issue (hopefully). 
my guess is that your system will normalize. 
also it is worthy to note 550w psu actually runs at 85% of that. 
i know the 8800 take quite a bit of power. 
if you do the swap and your still having issues, let us know. 
also check those other forums and as much as it sucks, attempt to contact tech support at evga or nvidia.
