yeah i know.i have 2 other machines that i output to tv with using the svideo out. 
i really like it for watching movies when travelling. this is why i was hoping i could get the cable to work with the laptop with only vga out..... anyway i was trying to avoid spending alot of money on one of those big vga converter boxes.....
