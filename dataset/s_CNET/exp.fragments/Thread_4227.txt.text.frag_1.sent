specs: 160 gb maxxtor hd windows xp home nforce 2 mobo (with dual channel ram capabilities) nvidia geforce 4 mx 4000+ amd athlon xp 3000+ today i purchased 2 pny sticks of 512mb ddr ram. 
i have one already in my computer, but another brand. 
i have 2 banks on my motherboard, 3 slots. 
i put the new ram into bank 1, and the older one into the second bank. 
i start windows and after a minute or so or windows being loaded, i get a bsod. 
i got this twice. 
(i have the details if needed). 
i remove the old ram, and everything works fine, for about an hour. 
then my computer randomly reboots. 
i start t back up, and get the same thing. 
the only thing i figure culd be wrong is my vdd power voltage. 
i set it at 1.6 v, but everytime i start up, stats like the voltage and temps show up, and its red and only showing 1.3-&gt;1.45v. 
i dont know what the deal is. 
thinking this problem was with windows and the software, i decide to restore my computer. 
after backing up and everything, i put all of the ram in and begin the process. 
at 11% formatting, it freezes completely. 
so, this must be a hardware problem...ive used each of the ram seperatly so i know none of them is bad. 
but i cant get them to work, and i dont know why. 
whats the deal? 
i thought this would take about 5 minutes and id be all set...not the whole damn day. 
&gt;_&lt; p.s. im 100% sure the ram is compatable with my mobo and it can handle that much
