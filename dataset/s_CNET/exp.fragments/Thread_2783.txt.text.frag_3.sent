my wifi dc is 12 v and cable modem is 12 v. you mean they need total 24 v to supply power to each networking, rite? 
so i need to buy new power adapter which could supply 24v and the injector. 
i thought it could make it in easy way without add something component. 
i see, that's clear...:) btw, do you ever use buffalo's router infinia wireless n? what do u think? 
thx
