the printer self test doesnt work. 
i remember this problem starting when i switched off the computer and the printer hadnt finished switching off. 
i tried printscreen, printscreen, but the command is invalid. 
should i just type c:&gt;printscreen then enter? 
sorry, i'm not very dos literate. 
my computer is french, so windows is in french, but i guess ms dos is universal?
