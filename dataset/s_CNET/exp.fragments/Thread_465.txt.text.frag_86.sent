my pc is 18 months old. 
even though i hate hp, that is what i have. 
i know some are asking why did you buy it? 
well, that's the catch. 
i didn't. 
when someone is buying you something, you take it, even if you don't want or like it. 
if it had been my money, i would have bought a sony. the pc in question is a custom a1750y series hp 3 gig using vista. 
prior to that, i was on another hp, that was purchased in 1999, the 6746c 733-mhz using windows me. 
i basically skipped over the xp thing where folk preferred it to vista. 
i prefer windows 98 to all other os, even though vista is just fine to me.
