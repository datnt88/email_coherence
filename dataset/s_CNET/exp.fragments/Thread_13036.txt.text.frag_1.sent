i am wondering if netbooks can handle skype and a couple other programs at the same time. 
the netbooks are starting to look attractive to me as a replacement for an old laptop that has roughly the same speed processor and a much smaller hard drive than comes with the netbooks. 
how practical is it to use one of these with skype (including video on both ends) while having perhaps a web browser and outlook open at the same time?
