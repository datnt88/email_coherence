first time was because of a virus. 
it was 5-6 years ago and did not think i needed virus protection. 
i know better now. 
second time was when i installed vista over xp and was using a older registry cleaner. 
started to have features like photo viewing quit working, and network sharing problems. 
after doing a clean install of vista all has been working fine. 
i also quit using registry cleaners.
