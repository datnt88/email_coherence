i have the netgear wps606 which i was so happy with i bought a second one. 
this type of device is really great. 
i paid 25 for it refurb and know why. the setup instructions would cause most to return it but you can imagine i worked with it and it was just the thing for my kid's 360 and pc bridge. the xbox 360 wifi runs 99 bucks. 
for much less i got the pc and 360 on the air.
