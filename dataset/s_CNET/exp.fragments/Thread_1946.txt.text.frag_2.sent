xp does not like being put into a different system. 
it does not recognize the new system's hardware. 
most likely will have to a new install, including mobo drivers and other drivers. 
you can save your data to a cd before moving the drive, but not most of the app's. 
they need to be reinstalled to restablish the .dll's 
etc..
