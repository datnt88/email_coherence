hello, i have a d-link di-514 wireless router and i've been using it from past one year, i connect my laptop and mobile through wifi with my pc(windows xp), it has been working fine till now, all of a sudden fron last night my laptop and mobile are unable to detect the wifi signals(provided, internet on pc is working fine), i tried all possible trouble shooting steps but, none worked for me....can you please suggest me what possibly might have gone wrong, and what am i supposed to do, to make my wifi router working again. 
thanks in advance.
