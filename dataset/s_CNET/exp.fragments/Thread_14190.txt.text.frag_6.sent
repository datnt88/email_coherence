even though the question started out as ranking of intel's top of the line proc's, it inevitably leads i believe into the top of the technology line in memory. 
from the research i've done ddr3 gives you 16000mtps & 25600mbps over a puny ddr2. 
so my question then is, if i am going with the top of the top of the intel line (looks like xeon so far) especially in a quad config. 
wouldn't it just make more sense to marry these to ddr3 to give you the top perf? 
am i correct on this? 
pls clarify anyone on this.
