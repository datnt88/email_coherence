i was thinking around a total price tag of $1000-$1100, so the intel high performance gets close. 
i was really trying to ask if i should wait to get a quad core. 
will it be worth it? 
or do you think that average person/engineering student would really benefit that much from a quad core? 
also, why would you strongly recommend only 2gb ram? 
i will probably just run vista home premium. 
thanks for the reply!!
