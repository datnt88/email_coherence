thanks for your prompt response. 
we am convinced it is coming from the clients. 
here is scenario: we have 3 aps and all will be working fine, suddenly the wireless manager will show a peer 2 peer device with ssid &quot;intertouch ghm lobby&quot; broadcasting at the same frequency as the aps. 
at that instant, the associated clients will loose connections. 
now, here is what we did: the &quot;intertouch ghm lobby&quot; ssid shows with the signal strenght. 
so we used a laptop to trace it until the signal strenght was 100% (it was another laptop). 
we shut the laptop down, and the ssid disappeared. 
after a while, it came up again and we traced it like before and it landed on another laptop. 
as soon as we shut it down, it diappeared. 
out theory: it seems the dos attack is running like a script. 
it started perhaps with one of the clients, but now has disbritued to other clients (we have counted about 5 so far out of 20 systems). 
how do we detect and remove it from the laptops? 
can an antivirus do it? 
what is the approach to stopping it from repeating? 
thanks a million.
