i just purchased a dell 4700 series and took a 4 year warranty. 
right before i purchased a dell i had a pc built. 
what a nightmare. 
i had the computer 30 days and had the cdrw replaced twice. 
then he charged me a 15% restocking fee. 
i decided to cut my losses and just pay him to take it back and bought a dell that night. 
after that experience i decided to get the 4 year warranty. 
i am not a teck so i don't know how to repair computers and am a little afraid to mess with in inards of the machine. 
if i wouldn't have given my old computer to the person i had build the one i returned i would have practiced on that. 
i had a computer built because he had a good reputation and it was in town. 
my mistake. 
good luck with your new computer.
