hi! try looking at the hp mini 311 or the toshiba nb 200 and the nokia booklet 3g. they are the somehow very cheap and very nice and very portable to bring. 
it is very handy and somehow also wifi available. 
but i'm not very much with the battery life but these netbookse are one of the best. 
also msi wind netbook
