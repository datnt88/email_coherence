these are all new devices sony laptop, belkin router, and canon printer. 
should i research on how they deal with wpa2 level of encryption? 
tired tonight, will spend some time in the next few days on how, where, and which device to change this setting if neccessary for better security. 
live in a condo development and i see several users some secure, some not. 
no expert at this stuff. 
thanks for your help.
