i recently read about this tablet pc by wipro called e.go so i checked out its website @ as well. 
and it looks amazing. the screen rotates 180degrees, the colour is really nice and it has a stylus as well. 
but what i want to know is - is it a good laptop for a young business professional? 
and how much is it for? 
any information on this laptop would be really helpful. 
thanks
