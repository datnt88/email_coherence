symptoms are as following: you get a message a: is not accessible incorrect function when accessing the floppy drive and d: is not accessible incorrect function when accessing the cd drives in windows xp. if you boot with a floppy all hardware works great. 
if you boot xp with a cd in the drive you are able to read that cd. the problem seems to be with nero burning rom. 
(system also has norton system works 2004 on it.) i uninstalled the older oem version of nero and installed the newer oem version 5.5.10.53 and everything works great! 
i really hope this helps someone as it took me a while to figure out what was going on. 
good luck!
