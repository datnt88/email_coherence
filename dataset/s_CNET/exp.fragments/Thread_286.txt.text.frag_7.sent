why cant there be just a quick easy fix?? guess this makes for a good learning experience. 
i'm going to try to give hp a call today and see if they can help me out. 
if not i will try to use the drivermax sugesstion, that actually sounds like it may work! 
i appreciate all your guys help and ideas. 
if you have any more i'm all ears.
