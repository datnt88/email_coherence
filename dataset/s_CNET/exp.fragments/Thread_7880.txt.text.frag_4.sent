sorry for butting in this conversation, but the cheapest macbook is $1099, and that's just the basic configuration. 
if you are doing basic tasks such as word processing, powerpoint, and music, there is no reason why you should buy a $1100 computer when a $600 windows vista laptop will do everything that you want. 
does this make sense? 
of course, there will be an argument about security and web browsing, for that, use firefox 2 for the browser because it would be a lot safer than ie7. 
remember, if you go with windows, make sure to have antivirus programs which can be bought for free. 
this really wasn't an argument to tell the original poster not to get a mac in general, but to save some money.
