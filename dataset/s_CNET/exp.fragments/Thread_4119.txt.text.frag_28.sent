robt says that his machine is an aging xp setup. 
he doesn't tell us which p4 he is using. 
there is a huge difference between a 478 pin and core 2 duo p4. he also says that he has 3 gig of ram. 
hopefully he is using xp pro as home can't use that much ram even though it will load with it. 
he also says that two particular games ran well then suddenly they didn't. 
how long did they run well? 
did robt load some other app that took away free ram? the vid card has onboard ram but that in itself is not sufficient to run the apps. 
robt. 
has to isolate the computer from secondary programs that are using system resources. 
the situation is not much different than the complaint &quot;my system is running slow&quot;. 
you have to remove all variables and find out why the games would run when the card first was installed then suddenly ran poorly. 
other than equipment failure, something in the time period between good and bad changed, perhaps even a virus. 
either the machine is crapping out or there is something that changed the machines available resources. 
it has to be one or the other as computers either work or they don't. 
in the old days we would create boot environments to play games. 
i think that robt has to start his machine with minimal apps and processes running and see if the games run well. 
he also has to look back to see if he has also added any new hardware other than the vid card. 
these can cause resource conflicts as well. 
if the games do run well, then you have to add back in, one at a time, all of the apps and processes. 
that way you can find the offending application. 
when the games crap out the app is found. 
if it is new hardware added then you have to evaluate the need for the hardware or if it is defective. 
regardless, all of this is based upon the basic premise that the games ran well for a reasonable time. the problem seems to be a basic diagnostic problem.
