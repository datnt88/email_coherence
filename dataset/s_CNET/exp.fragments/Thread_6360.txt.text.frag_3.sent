they are wired the same, they appear, on the outside, to be the same. 
but cat6 has better shielding, and perhaps better insulation. 
if you are needing something for short runs, like just a few feet, then either cable will work fine, but if you are needing something that is going to go further, or near high radio-noise inducing areas, like near actual transmitting radios, or power lines, then if you have 1gb (gigabit) devices (on both ends) minimize the possible noise conflict and get cat6 cables.
