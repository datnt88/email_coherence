primary hard drive always has two partitions .... - partition 1 ...for the os and the apps. 
- partition 2 ...for all data, downloads, updates, etc., the advantage here is partition c could get corrupted or won't boot but you could still reformat c:, install the os and apps and what's on d: should still be there. 
it's your first step toward isolating and protecting your data in a single hard drive system. 
not failsafe but better in my opinion than the single partition in the event of drive or os corruption.
