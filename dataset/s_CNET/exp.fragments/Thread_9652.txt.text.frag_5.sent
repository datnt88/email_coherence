you can use the master/slave jumpering if you like, but cs does ok too. 
once, you jumper correctly, and installed on hd cable properly as well, keeping the new hd as originally connected and place the old hd on remaining connector. 
once all that is done, hopefully when powered-on the new system sees the old hd. if it asks for a &quot;dual boot setup&quot; decline should it ask. 
otherwise, if the old hd does get acknowledged, then finish boot, retrieve data to any storage device. 
once, you're finished, remove old hd(power down) and return new system as it was. the method robert offered is another way, you can try. 
if the process i suggested fails -or- you play it safe and deal only as robert posted first then any *possible* glitch is keeping on the usb enclosure and keeps the new system from poof factor(rare). the plus side if it works and you get all required data, you can reformat the old hd and then use it as a ext. 
storage device. 
you can also use a entirely new larger hd as well of even greater storage capacity. the fd drive if your new system doesn't have it, more than likely will accept it. 
you will the old cables and access to a fd port on the new mtrbd. 
and set the bios to accept it. 
if you find no *legacy fd port* then using a usb type floppy is still an option. 
using usb for fd usage will require such a purchase if you want to retain that storage method.
