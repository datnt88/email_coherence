i currently have an hp computer with pentium 4 2.8 ghz processor and 1 gb ram. 
i'm looking at this computer - can someone tell me if will be faster? 
i know the processor speed is 2.5 instead of 2.8 but it is quad core. 
i don't want to purchase this if i'm not going to notice a difference in speed. 
thank you, linda
