hey guys, here's my question: i had 3gb of 800 mhz ram running in my computer. 
i guess i decided that i had some money to waste or something so i upgraded it to 4gb (1x4) of 1066 mhz. 
i understand that with the limitations of a 32 bit operating system i won't get the full 4gb, but my ram is downclocked from 1066 to 667. 
why? 
i tried installing them all individually to make sure i didn't have a bad stick, and i even returned them and got a new batch, same deal. 
any thoughts?
