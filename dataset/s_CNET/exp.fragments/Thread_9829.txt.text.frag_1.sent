on my recycle bin properties, the check mark for, &quot;do not move files to the recycle bin. 
remove files immediately when deleted&quot; is check & shaded out, so do i restore that so i can remove the check mark? 
also is there a link to go to to set the best setting for firefox's &quot;about:config&quot; because my firefox freezes once in while, & i was wondering on the best setting for that?
