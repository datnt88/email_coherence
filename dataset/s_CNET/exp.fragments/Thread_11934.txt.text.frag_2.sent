since you've got both vga and dvi inputs, it will be easy if you've got an xbox360 since you can pickup a vga output at most places that sell the 360. 
if you've got a classic xbox, vga adapters were made but they seem to have disappeared -- check ebay if your console has component outputs, ebay has transcoder for about $50 but i don't know how good/bad the picture quality will be. 
(or search for &quot;ps2 vga&quot;)
