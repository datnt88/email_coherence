i tried to update the firmware and wasn't able to (i stated this before in posts). 
i wouldn't call that sad. 
i tried your suggestions and it didn't work. 
so now i'm trying something else. 
i understand your point, but again i'm confident the problem lies with the linksys router itself. 
especially after it was working for quite some time. 
plus, with all my online research regarding my current router, there have been a ton of user complaints in having many issues like i have had with this specific model. 
lastly, i don't see where the key combo you mentioned again was stated by a previous post. 
regardless, all that key combo did was turn the network adapter on and off, not really any help.
