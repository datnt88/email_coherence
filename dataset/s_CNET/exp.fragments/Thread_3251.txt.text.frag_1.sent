hi, i have a e-machines t5016 desktop which just died recently. 
it is less than a year and a half old. 
i had it checked and it was not the power system or switch. 
it was suggested it might be the motherboard. 
does this sound right and how do i make sure? 
should i use e-machines replacement parts or something else? 
i have installed extra memory before so would i be able to replace the motherboard myself or is it a technical job? 
don
