if you want to go into the bandwidth question 4x agp is perfectly fine it will only be a slight bottleneck in doom 3, in everything else it's easily sufficient for any game you could run and the external power connector is found on some 5700's (just as a note) the external power connector is a &quot;port&quot; on the back of the grpahics card, simmilar to that on a hard drive, and it connects the card to the psu to get it the extra power it needs most cards only require 1, but there are a few that require 2 (xgi's volari duo v8 ultra, nvidia's 6800 ultra) personally i'd suggest a geforce 6600 for the agp 4x system not only does that card support directx 9, it also supports sm3.0 (which radeon 9 and radeon x series cards do not) and it sports fp32 (radeon 9 and radeon x only have fp24) not the fastest card on the block but it should handle any game this is on sale for a little while it should work fine in your system, assuming it has a power supply able to handle it it says agp 8x, while all of the cards based on the same processor say they are agp 4x/8x cross compatable given that it could be a leadtek unique thing i'd suggest not buying that 6800le unless your ok with the possibility of returning it and i'll look into that card a little more
