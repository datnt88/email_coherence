this is your basic oem build pc from hp. 1st the amd cpu tends to run slightly hotter, but well cooled by most setups. 
however, once added &quot;hot air&quot; is thrown in it starts to create heat build-up. 
your new gpu will do that, so be sure its fan or cooling setup is well cared for. 
as others suggested, added cooling can greatly improve the situation. 
they already covered that so i add, either add more fans or improve(replace) current fan(s) for better rpms for air exchange. 
make darn sure how that new psu is working with its fans, some maybe counter to accepted oem &quot;air flow&quot;, so inspect. 
if optional range setting, increase it.
