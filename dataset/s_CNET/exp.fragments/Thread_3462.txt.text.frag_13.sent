hey linkit. 
i found a copy of the original adapter set-up disk that i had burned, in my caotic pile of &quot;stuff&quot; in my bottom drawer. 
i ran it and hey pres! 
i'm back on net. it confirms what i suspected: that drivers are sometimes not enough as the set-up disk holds other secrets. 
so now i can sleep a bit more soundly:-) thanks for your contribution. 
regards stewart
