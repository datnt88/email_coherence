let's be 100% clear here, *any* ext. 
hd storage is not permanent, so take heed and save critical data to discs. 
if super critical, then make multiple copies. 
next, treat your ext. 
hd like eggs just to cover it should be treated well. 
no matter how they advertise it, hds still have moving parts,etc. 
and damage can be done one way or another. 
mount and dismount using the proper procedure, don't just disconnect, even though you may have done this many times before, it can bite you. 
oh yeah, power issues, be sure to take care of that, remember, most ext. 
hd need low voltage to run, so spikes aren't good. 
last, treat the ext. 
media like any other media storage. 
that's all it is another area to store media. 
while you want this as back-up or similar, use what came with it, it works. 
however, if manual, then again the user need only make a folder or directory or even partition it and use that storage. 
do this as if it were like an int. 
hd, same-o same-o, like you've done before, that ext. 
hd, is drive ???. you can check shareware s/w or freebies, check out goodsync as an example. 
the here is a good source among others.
