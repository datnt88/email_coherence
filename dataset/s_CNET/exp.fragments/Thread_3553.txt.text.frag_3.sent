one supports extreme edition with ht, and the other doesn't. 
i would get the 955, but nothings future proof right now. 
socket 939 won't be used by amd for much longer. 
there are already plans for the next dual cores to use a new socket. 
probably in a year, socket 939: old: socket 754: currently old.
