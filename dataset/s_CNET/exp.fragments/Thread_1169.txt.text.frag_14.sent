have 5 volts. 
does the hard drive rotate? the newer mobos provide power to the cpu via the 12 volt line [at one time they used the 5 volt line]. 
if you have the 5 volts and no fans or anything running you then have no 12 volts, which depending on your computer mobo may mean that the cpu also doesn't get power. 
for this to happen on two power supplies is hard to understand for me, although in the last month or so in these forums i have seen others with that problem. 
wonder if they were all emachines. 
normally if the cpu were shorted and overloaded the supply, all the main voltages would shut down automatically. 
possibly your power supply only shuts down the voltage main that is overloaded. 
i don't think that i can offer much help. 
at this point after you go back and make certain that you replug everything in, the only thing left is remove/replace trouble shooting. 
doesn't sound too good for the cpu. 
good luck. 
you wouldn't be the first in these forums that found the pc suddenly working after rechecking all connections for the third time.
