hey guys, so i recently aquired a new mobo, cpu, and some ram. 
so basically a whole new setup. 
i installed all these new parts with my old video card and harddrive and booted up. 
first problem i ran into was with the os. ( running old windows xp) so i used the repair and after a while got everything running. 
did windows update for everything it would give me. 
but my sound is not playing at all. 
no sound from anything. 
i went on the mobo site and tried to get the audio driver but whenever i install it and restart it doesnt show up in device managers. 
fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads think this is the step i need to do, and not 100% on if i did it right i did update my video card drivers fromt the website as well and the only yellow exclamation marks i have left in device managers is unknown devices in the other category. 
( 3 of them.) specs. 
asus p8p57 deluxe - mobo intel core 2 quad q9550 - cpu ati radeon hd 4600 series - graphics card 4gbs ram
