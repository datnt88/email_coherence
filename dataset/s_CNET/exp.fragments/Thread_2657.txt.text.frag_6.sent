it is possible. 
did you make this system yourself or was it a name brand? 
i saw you said oem cd's, but you can buy those with systems you make. 
assuming it was a boxed item from some name brand, you may want to check back with the manufacturer. 
since you know what a capacitor even looks like, you may want to investigate the power supply and the power switch yourself. 
make sure all or your hardware (memory, add in cards, cables, etc) are all seated correctly.
