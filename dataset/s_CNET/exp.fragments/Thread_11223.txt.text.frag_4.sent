there is no limit to the number of hops introduced by ad-hoc networking that i am aware of. 
however, the 802.11 standard only briefly mentions bridging and does not define it well. 
i have seen many issues with bridges trying to associate with aps. 
some bridges have an option to clone the first mac that talks. 
they then act as a proxy for all other devices behind the bridge. 
try looking for an option like this. 
you did not mention address scheme so i can not tell if this is a routing issue or not. 
did you try a traceroute on the pc at site 3 to your isp dns server or router? 
are you using managed switches? 
check the forwarding database on the switch to see what devices have been learned. 
when bridging for the first time, same vendor equipment makes a big difference.
