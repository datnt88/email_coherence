i have an tripplite omnismart 1400 (5 batteries, 6v 12ah). 
i am trying to replace the batteries. 
i neglected writing down how they were installed prior to removal (big mistake!). now i am trying to re-install them but it does not look right. 
it currently look like: black - to ups electronics red - red black - black red - black red - black red - to ups electronics. 
i do not think this is correct even though the wires all fit. 
any help would really be appreciated - thanks..............
