thanks r. proffitt, i found no leakage or expansion so at least visually they look ok. this board is 1 yr. 
old though i understand it can happen with new ones too. 
how do i check for the 3.3v to the cpu as that's the one voltage i haven't been able to check. 
in another thread, someone posted a link with pictures showing how to check these voltages but it failed to discuss the details about the aux if mine actually has one? 
there are 2 connectors from the power supply to the board. 
how would you know if it's the cpu or the motherboard if that is the problem?
