i see another good idea from kees, and note that you will swap out the monitor to see if the problem is there. 
in fact i was going to type on about ... &quot;if not, i would wonder about the event viewer showing events a minute apart.&quot;, but re-reading your first post, i now see you are talking about anything up to a 20 minute wait before the display shows. 
so, now i'm not at all sure anything in the event viewer, or anything else software wise, would be causing this, and it looks like kees' suggestion might have hit the nail on the head. 
let's see what you find out when you swap the monitor. 
good luck.
