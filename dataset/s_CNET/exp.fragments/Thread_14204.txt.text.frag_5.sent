it's very good that you keep programs in one place, but it's not enough. 
for sure you need to make system partition backup . 
this file will contain os and all your apps configurations with roads to them. 
you'll get an exact image of your c drive, keep it on f, also copy to cd (due to compression it takes not much space). 
and if your os suddenly crash, you could immediately restore it. 
as for me, i always use this method to keep and protect data.
