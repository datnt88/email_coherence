i installed a dvd burner in a friends 2400 awhile ago and just went to circuit city and picked up a hp brand burner for less than $50.00. 
installed it and it has been working good for her. 
dell told her that only a dell burner would work, thats not true. the only problem i had was one screw was just a hair off, but it does fit. 
just set both drives to cs. it came with nero 7 if i remember right.
