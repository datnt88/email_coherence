the one thing i find some to forget is that all this stuff is still buggy. the occasionally crash, drop is to be expected. 
if you feel otherwise you only need more time in your current task or take up programming. 
all the companies are shipping with known bugs. 
not to say it's not something along the lines of a bad cable, connection but that blown transformer is interesting. 
-&gt; if the logs show who calls in then you trace their lines to which switch and see if they all share that switch. 
i did that once and found a flakey switch. 
of course it worked most of the time which made replacement difficult for some companies. 
since i only answer to me i swapped it out.
