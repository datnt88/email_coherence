hi! it's can't access the bios in my computer! 
it's and old compaq presario modell 8455ea. 
i have search the net and found out that this is a typically problem with compaq computers. 
but, it can't be impossible, or?! when i start the computer i first press esc to se the compaq logo and the text below on the screen &quot;press f10 for setup&quot; i do, then i read somewhere that you should wait untill a cursor flash in the left upper corner and then press f10. 
despite all this there is no access to bios, xp starts almost immediate! 
i need to access the bios si i can uppgrade the memory. 
i appreciate if someone know more about this and could help me? 
thanks!
