there is a know issue where dvd-rw disks appear to be empty in windows explorer on windows xp service pack 2-based computers. the microsoft article i found says that there is a supported hotfix available. the article adress is: support.microsoft.com/?kbid=899527 
i haven't gotten the fix yet--i don't want to pay $35.00 for a tech support email. 
as far as i can tell, windows xp sp1 had a similar problem. 
i wrote nero developers tech support also, but haven't heard back from them.
