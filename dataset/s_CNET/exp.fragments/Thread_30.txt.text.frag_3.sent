one reason many devices, etc. are placed in &quot;metal boxes&quot; is to help reduce the spread of flames. 
you will notice just about all system cases, psues, cds, etc. are metal or metal lined besides the faraday effect. 
the metal box retards the flames ability, but still is a threat if it really unnoticed or unattended. 
fyi - i have seen fires within production lines of some devices during rebuilds(refurbs) during final testing, it happens.
