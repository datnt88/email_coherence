i appreciate you sticking with me on this. 
i tried items 1, 3, & 4 with no success. 
i didn't attempt 2 because of the warning: &quot;uninstall all cd or dvd writing or recording programs&quot; before using this method. 
i have a writing program that was pre-installed on my computer with the os (program called click to dvd). 
if i delete it i don't know how to re-install as i don't have any install discs. 
at any rate, i see that this procedure is for resolving the error if the drive is missing from my computer, but shows in device manager with a conflict. 
this isn't my problem. the drives are shown in my computer and there is no conflict shown in device manager. 
am i running out of options?
