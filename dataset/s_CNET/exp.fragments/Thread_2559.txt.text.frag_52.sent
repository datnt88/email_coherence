hi steve- you start here from a bunch of google hits: as to your last question, i would say not necessarily. 
sometime you simply get what you pay for- cheap in price, cheap in quality, so you have to shop very carefully. 
at newegg, i like to read the user reviews. 
but even with a quality part, like say, a high end video card, there's always unknowns, like the type of motherboard & bios- some baords and bioses simply don't agree. 
i'm an nvidia fan, so i always buy nvidia based cards, knowing their drivers are compatible with xp- unlike ati, i've read about too many problems with their catylyst drivers i wouldn't even think about buying an ati card. 
i've been building my own for about 10 yrs, so i tend to go with brands i'm familiar with, e.g, western digital for hardrives, creative for soundcards, leadtek for videocards/tv tuners; you can't go wrong with a plextor dvd burner, but many are happy with lite-on (very cheap) which seems to work very well for what they charge. 
i have a 5 yr. 
old lite-on cd burner/dvd player that's still chugging along very well. 
with ram, i almost always go with..it's a big name in ram....geez the name escapes me, but often you'll find &quot;no-name&quot; brands are in fact made by a big name vendor if you do enough digging. the first thing i always suggest to someone who's building their own is: what's your budget? then work from there. 
if you go to a configurator, when you're done, don't be surprised you may be spending thousands of dollars. the bottom line with any hardware- there's no guarantees. 
the top of the line can fail on you right out of the box, a cheapie can last for years. 
that's why for the most part, i buy my parts from a local pc shop, where, if the piece of hardware fails within the store's warranty period, i just bring it back to them and let them worry about it (i'm just lazy). 
my 6800 vid card that cost me a little over $400 tanked on me in about 8 months time- cuz i'm such a lazy-a** i still haven't sent it back to leadtek, who responded very quickly to my email. 
also take into consideration what your needs are- are you a gamer? 
no? then you don't need the fastest chip on the block, and you'd do well with 512 megs of ram (what i consider the bare minimum to run xp). 
are you interested in making your pc a &quot;tivo&quot;? 
then you need to make sure you have a free pci slot for a tv tuner card. 
not interested in that, then forget it, and move on. 
like making your own movies from your digital camcorder? 
then make sure you have a front firewire connection (less hassle than rooting around the back of the pc, and firewire is better than usb when transferring video- despite it being a bit slower in transfer rate). 
there are so many factors when building your own, and i'm by no means the person with all the answers- i'm sure someone will come in here and challenge me on ati vid cards- to each his own. 
i have my own biases as does everyone. 
don't take my word as gospel. 
sorry, gotta run, will try to add something later if it comes to mind.
