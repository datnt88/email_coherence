can you get the free se updates for this one? 
as well, try to get your hands on an old 3com 905 series nic. 
these had drivers written for win 98 and they worked. 
i've given a box load of these things away and keep a couple handy for troubleshooting or second nics in xp machines because xp already knows them. 
great old board.
