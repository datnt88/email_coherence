&quot;i ran off a magazine cover for a friend's church magazine .&quot; is your clue. that 1400 sheets would be at about 5% coverage if i recall so at full coverage that's about 70 sheets? 
you got about 150 sheets so my guesstimate looks to be about 50% off. 
nothing amiss here. 
just figure one us dollar a page for full page prints and you'll understand why we run to a print shop for that work.
