to fix the problems in my gm5478, i have replaced the power supply (which wasn't the cause of the problems) and now the graphics card (which seems to work). 
to stick with a setup matching factory items, i picked up a power supply from tigerdirect - &quot;a406-1087 xion simple power 630w atx power supply&quot;, was reasonable and had plenty of power, slips right into the same space. 
also, from tigerdirect, i bought the &quot;xfx geforce 8500 gt ultra silent cooling video card&quot; because it doesn't have a fan, just a monster heat sink. 
in combination with bios updates there are no longer any more reboots. 
running this way for over a month without a single problem. 
i did change the setting for &quot;reboot on error&quot;, and i turned off all power settings for the monitor and hard drive. 
spending a total of $120 extra has made this system stable, for now.
