oh, sorry..im not good at writing posts out, i know.. its model number sr2011wm and crucial says it'll hold up to 2 gigs of ram. 
but if one of the sticks works by themselves, the other one should too shouldn't it? 
i mean, they are identical.. but the one that doesn't work by itself will work with another stick of ram as long as it isn't the identical one. 
i did, however leave out how both sticks are 800mhz and my comp only supports 533 mhz, but it does dumb them down to the slower speed. 
it seems to me like the stick that wont work by itself is just bad..but if its bad why will it work with a different stick, and why will it work in another computer? 
gah, i'll screw with it some more.
