from my own experience, for low-end to mid-range pc's, the better value are prebuilts. 
but for bleeding-edge gamer/graphics systems, i can build systems with top-of-the-line components(thanks newegg) hundreds cheaper than what alienware or falcon northwest can put out. 
but irrespective of what kind of system you buy or build, i would encourage you to strive to be the best stite you can be. 
as lvfinch noted, &quot;hands on&quot; experience is the key. 
don't be turned-off from building your own system just because you lack the &quot;papers&quot;. 
as a self-confessed stite since the intel 8088 days (padded with a computer science & engineering degree, and well over a decade of it work experience), you don't need certification to build your own computer. 
i've built a fair amount of systems for myself and others, and along the way i've &quot;burnt&quot; some components. 
but you learn and get better. 
what with the internet, peruse the many modz and overclocker sites to garner knowledge and understanding. 
i'll bet most modders and oc's don't have and don't need certification. 
but do purchase one of those &quot;build your own system&quot; books to fill-in the holes. 
also, do your research before buying any component. 
as there are so many variants out there, compatibility is a big issue. 
lastly, seriously consider upgrade-ability. 
what with the upcoming pci-x format, many of todays components will be obsolete in regards to performance. 
once these new boards are out, my next system will be an amd 64 running linux-64.
