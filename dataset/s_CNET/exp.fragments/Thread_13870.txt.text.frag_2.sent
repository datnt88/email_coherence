&quot;using an external hard drive with a usb 2.0 connection to backup all my important documents.&quot; 
this means to me this is a backup and not the only copy. 
if the only copy then where is the backup? 
that is, you did write backup and not &quot;to store all my...&quot; the issue of usb powered drives is not unknown. 
try adding a powered usb hub or if your unit supports it, add a power supply to it. 
if it is backup, then just delete the partition, create and format a new partition and begin again but keep an eye out for corruption. 
if it does corrupt then make it a warranty issue.
