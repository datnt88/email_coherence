it is set up per the sticky. 
i tried that link zmark provided. 
i downloaded the easylink firmware tool. 
to upgrade the firmware, i was prompted to plug the ethernet cable (from the back of my wired computer) into the laptop itself, with the other end already in &quot;port 1&quot;. 
well, the router never recognized the ethernet cable in port 1, so when i clicked to proceed forward, the router was not recognized, nothing happened, and i have the same problem. 
i vaguely remember now when i first got the router, i went through the necessary steps with the router and the pc, did everything fine. 
then i just started up my laptop, it recognized the network created on my pc, and i just used the internet on my laptop that way. 
however i have always received the following message when starting up my laptop: &quot;duplicate name exists on the network&quot;. 
i usually just x out of it, and proceed forward. 
so my question is, did the actions listed above create my current problem? 
why isn't my router recognizing the ethernet cable plugged into it from the laptop? 
also, is there any way to test if the issues stems with my network adapter in my laptop???
