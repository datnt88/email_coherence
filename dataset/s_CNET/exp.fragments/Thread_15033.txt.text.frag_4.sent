just now i finished with the checking disk and also defragmentation, but the problem still occurs. 
it copies to a certain limit and it freezes, light on the hdd blinking very fast, the &quot;time remaining&quot; says &quot;calculating...&quot; and the &quot;speed&quot; stays as 135mb/sec without any change.
