i have a dell dimension 4700 desktop with windows xp pro sp2. 
i read the cnet forums with interest and have learned a great deal over these past couple of years. 
however, there is one area which i have not been able to grasp, and that is &quot;partitioning and formatting the hard drive&quot;. 
question 1 - why does the hard drive need to be partitioned and formatted? 
question 2 - how is partitioning and formatting done? 
i read in one particular cnet response, that all you had to do in windows was to go to &quot;disk management&quot; to complete this task, however, i have searched and can not even find &quot;disk management&quot; on my computer. 
for anyone who wishes to respond to my query: please keep your answer simple and non-technical, because there has been nothing on this topic in the forums so far which i have been able to understand. 
thank you so much for all the help i have received from cnet forums just by reading the responses to other peoples' questions.
