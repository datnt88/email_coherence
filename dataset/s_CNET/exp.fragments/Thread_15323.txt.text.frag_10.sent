i to, have a t6420 which lasted a whole 18 months before its untimely demise. 
such a long life. 
called e-machines at there non toll free number ( 408-273-0888),thank god for nationwide cell plans, and vented on them. 
did no good of course, but i feel a little better. 
i guess i'm going to strip the e-machine of all the drives, most of which were upgrades i installed, and buy a new quality case, motherboard, and cpu and install my drives and boards in it. 
one things sure, i'll never go near a e-machine or gateway again.
