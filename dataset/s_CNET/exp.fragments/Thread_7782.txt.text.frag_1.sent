hi everyone there are two hard disks in this pc both are set as master and each is alone on an ide channel. 
one is 10 gig with windows98 and one 20 gig with windows 2000 in this phoenix bios there is no option auto detect hard drive when i turn it on, the pc always boot on windows 2000,even after i swaped them. 
(first 10 gig hd with w98 at primary and then it is on secondary ide) after booting we can see both hard disks in my computer if i take out the 20 gig with windows 2000 the pc can not boot there is an error message on the screen no operating system found that means the bios can not detect the 10 gig hard disk. 
this motherboard is intel 82810 810 chipset do you have any idea? 
thank you for your precious time and advice.
