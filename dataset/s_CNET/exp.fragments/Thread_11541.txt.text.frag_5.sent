i got a used computer from a relitive. 
they said the computer was off and there was a storm. 
they heard a loud crack from the computer. 
the next day, when an attempted power-on was done, the power light did not come on, and there was no image on the monitor. 
i got it to work on. 
i wasn't sure what was wrong, so i stripped out all the pci cards (modem, sound card, etc.)and i turned it on and it worked. 
i suggust you try taking out the pci cards.
