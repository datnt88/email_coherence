i rarely see any company rule so harshly. 
given the nature of desktops and the need to clean them yearly how would we avoid opening the case. 
of course they would cover a non-stock setup. 
but if you do this right you can return it to stock when needed. 
hard disks are so cheap that i could remove the supplied drive, slip in a new drive just for my use.
