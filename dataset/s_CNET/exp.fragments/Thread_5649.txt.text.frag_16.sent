i can't believe no one mentioned ram. 
having an adequate amount of memory is possibly the most important factor in doing all of those things at once with no slow down. 
(obviously, connection speed is very important, and a good processor too) basically, all the stuff your computer is currently doing is stored in the ram. 
if it runs out of ram, it starts using the hard disk to store data. 
one analogy is that the ram is your desk and the hard disk is a file cabinet down the hall. 
imagine having to make a few hundred trips up the hall every day because your desk is too small. the above recomendations are good (like a quality video card for actually *viewing* the movies) but for the tasks you described, make sure to get 4gb of ram (2gb, if cost is a concern; but not less, or expect slowdowns)
