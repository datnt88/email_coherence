hi, i have an external wd passport with 120gb of storage, formatted as fat32. 
somewhere on this forum i heard that fat32 storage is bad because it can break more easily then ntfs. 
should i reformat the wd passport as ntfs, what exactly is the difference. 
to do this i'm guessing you right click --&gt; format --&gt;ok? 
thanks
