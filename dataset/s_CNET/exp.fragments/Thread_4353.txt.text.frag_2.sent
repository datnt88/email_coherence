other causes i've found for this issue. 
1. type &quot;bad caps&quot; at google.com 2. i fixed a few by putting in a new power supply. 
there is some cmos reset or pwd reset jumpers on boards, which i will not write at length about. 
i use those to reset the cmos values and then setup the values again. 
rarely fixes the issue. 
worse case issue? the motherboard has failed in some odd way.
