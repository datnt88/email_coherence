i turned off my computer and monitors (2) and when returning a day later both monitors had the power light blinking. 
neither monitor would allow me to turn it off. the only way to turn off the monitors so they don't blink is to unplug them from wall. 
when plugging them back in they start blinking again. 
pushing the off/on button on either monitor has to no effect. 
i know the pc is booting up because of the various beeps i can hear, but the power light on both monitors just blink and they never turn on so i can see anything. 
suggestions/recommendation? 
thanks.
