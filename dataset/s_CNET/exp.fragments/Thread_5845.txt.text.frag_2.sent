i can't help those that don't backup or take the hint that the drive is failing either. 
this seems to be the only way people learn at times. 
at least i'll make your the backup poster person of the month if that makes you feel better. 
try one last thing. 
load the bios defaults and make sure it's on a good ide cable.
