ati 5870 x2 rampage extreme iii 12g ram intel i7 940 the electricity went out and came back on right away, after that when i turn on my computer, the fans and motherboard is working and lights on. 
but my monitor shows no signal. 
many says the power supply maybe broken buz of the power went down and back. is there any other possibilities that the video card nor the cpu r broken ? 
this is not the first time power went off and back on? 
but it is the first time the computer fail to restart when this happens?
