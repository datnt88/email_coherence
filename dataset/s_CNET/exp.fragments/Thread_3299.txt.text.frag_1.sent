just picked up a nas box for my seagate 400 gig sata drive. 
got it connected to my network and in the process i found that the drive needed to be formatted in ext3. 
never heard of it before. 
i used the nas and it's software to format the drive and it works perfectly. 
a short search said ext3 was a linux format. 
anyone know why the drive had to use that format? is that standard?
