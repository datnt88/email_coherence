are my bios settings screwed?? not unless you changed them. 
presume this just started happening. 
look to a power problem and, or possibly controller / drive fault. 
do the standard things like run an external fan on the open case and see if it runs longer before a fault - could be drive cooling. 
remove unecessary devices and see if it runs longer (less power consumption) check the connections - both sides - drive and at controller and controller and pci slot. 
try changing slots if necessary which will require re-installing drivers etc. back everything you need asap
