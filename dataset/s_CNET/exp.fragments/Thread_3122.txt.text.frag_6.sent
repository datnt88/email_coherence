the usb stuff. 
now, connect the router to the modem and the pc to the router. 
you'll have to read the owner's manual on how to access the router. 
in essence, you open a browser and type in an ip address. 
different routers use a different address, but they all will be 192.168.x.x. a browser window will open and the configuration screens are listed. 
my d-link uses 192.168.0.1. 
netgear i think uses 192.168.1.1. 
read the manual. the manual will tell you what screens do what, and how to configure the router for dsl. 
you then tell the router to turn on the wireless radio. 
again, all routers have different screens so i can't help you there. 
after you have turned wireless on you need to turn on encryption. 
there will be another screen for this. the easiest is wep which is a form of encryption. 
you'll set a pass code on the router and the same code on the laptop. 
i use the 10 character version. 
it is in hex which gives you the numbers 0-9 and letters a-f. 
make up anything you want but do not forget it! 
after you have set this up, exit the router by clicking on your home page. 
if you've done this correctly you'll surf. 
if you can surf wired, unplug and have the laptop look for a wireless network. 
it should see yours. 
since all laptops use different software for their wireless modems and some use windows to manage it and some use the card's software (cisco for one), you'll have to investigate yours. 
done, and good luck.
