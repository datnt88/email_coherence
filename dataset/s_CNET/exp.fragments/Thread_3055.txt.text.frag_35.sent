i am very curious as to what type of person can resort to name calling due to an os choice? 
does this individual really believe that they are actually a better computer user or even a better person by resorting to calling everyone who uses the home edition of xp wimps? 
i use professional due to heightened security issues while traveling and because it is our company standard. 
at home, my wife uses the home edition. 
i don't consider my wife, or anyone else for that matter, to be inferior for this decision. 
both home and professional have their plus and minus'. 
an individual's choice should not cause them to be called names. 
i believe the individual who posted this remark should take the high road and apologize for demeaning the users of this software. 
sincerely, kwkid
