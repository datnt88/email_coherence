stan, dell will not sell a computer without an operating system. 
so, you have no choice other than building your own if you want try using your own software. 
if you are using windows xp, you will not be able to activate it over the internet. 
you will have to call in and take your chances. 
i have found that dell is extremely competitive with low end machines, but if you are building a higher end machine, you can save money by building your own. 
that's where they make their profits. 
there are some mail order sites where you can buy hardware at virtually wholesale prices. 
but watch out for excessive shipping and special charges. 
buy a new hard drive. 
they are cheap. 
your modem is about the only thing i would save. 
maybe your case and power supply are salvagable. 
i assume you have an atx powersupply with the extra power connectors for either intel or amd cpu's? 
if not, get a decent powersupply. 
don't fall for those 450 watt ps for $9.99 ads! as far as amd vs intel goes, i prefer intel. 
i personally only use intel motherboards and intel cpus. 
however, standing up for one or the other is somewhat like attacking a religion. 
people support their favorites with religous fervor! 
i believe you can build a good system for a fair price and have a lot of fun doing it. 
there is one bit of technical advice i want to give you: the order of software installation is - 1) load the os, 2) load the motherboard drivers (the disk that comes with the motherboard) and finally, install any other required drivers such as the video card drivers. 
if you use an nvidia based video card, get the latest driver from their site. 
they offer a unified driver that suports their entire family of graphics products. 
good luck
