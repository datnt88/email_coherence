i am abilash an engineering student, ajce, kerala, india. 
i hav a p3(@550mhz) on intel se440bx-2 motherboard. 
hav a 320mb(2*128+64) of ram, 32mb s3 savage4 pci grafix & 80gb hdd. 
i am running on windows xp sp2 (with laters updates & hotfixes). 
hav also latest directx(9.0c 
dec 06), flash, shokewave player, and lots more... including vista theme(crystalxp). 
hav 2 problms trobling me... 1. when i try to zoom any picture in windows picture fax viewer my system crashes. 
i hav zone alarm internet security suite, avast antivirus and spyware doctor running on my pc. the same thing is happening even wheni tried the same with all the unwanted services are stopped. 
but other viewers of that of nero and others dont the problem. 
what can i do to stop this problm of reaching to the &quot;blue screen of deadth&quot; followed by a sudden restart of my pc? 2. i know i cant play high end games on my pc with a 550mhz cpu and 32mb of grafix so i used to play mid range games with the lowest settings(low resolution, low colour depdth, etc...). 
but some games sometimes while running(with no unwanted services running to use large part of my pc's memory) causes my display driver to stop or my system to crash or it hangs (just like dead and require manual restart to come alive again). 
what can i do to solve this? 
if somebody can help me pls mail me(abilash-a) @ abilash_a_t@yahoo.co.in or downloadjuke@yahoo.com
