you can also 'build your own' so to speak....pick out an external case of choice and a 2.5&quot; drive of choice and you're done.

most stand alone enclosures have 1 year warranties and stand alone drive warranties vary from 1 to 5 years. 
now some mfgs are now offering 7,200rpm laptop hdds...again your choice
