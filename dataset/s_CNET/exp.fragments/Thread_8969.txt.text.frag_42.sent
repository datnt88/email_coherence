i can't recall a single time when the only solution i had available was to wipe my hard drive, re-format, and, reinstall. 
this is not to say i haven't chosen this option because it was the least painful. 
i have re-formatted on many occasions but it was a choice, not the only way to remedy my problem. 
i'm willing to bet most people who indicated they had to do this either chose to or were not aware of their options. 
if your drive fails outright then a re-format won't help. 
in fact, i think i've even resurected a couple of drives without reformating. 
back in the cold dark days of dos there actually were occasions where you needed to low level format and then format but that was a long long time ago. 
other tips: backup your entire drive, not just the data. 
keep a boot disk or cd handy. 
learn to use the ms-windows &quot;repair console&quot; or whatever they call it. 
it gives you dos like access to the operating system. 
use the repair function built into windows xp and vista.
