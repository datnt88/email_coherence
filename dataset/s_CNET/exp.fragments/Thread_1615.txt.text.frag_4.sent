ok. how about a 480w powmax demon? 
my dad could probably use the 350w that comes with the case, his athlon is running on a 250 right now. 
i guess with the cdrw you're pointing out it doesnt come with anything? 
i can handle that, i just want to make sure all this stuff works together right and it isnt junk (mainly the m/b).
