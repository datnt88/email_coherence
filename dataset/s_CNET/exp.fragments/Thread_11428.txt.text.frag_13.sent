cost & features would be the determining factor. 
i have been using documents to go on various platforms for years... palm, andriod & ios. 
i seldom do anything from &quot;scratch&quot;, but use it to update excel & word files. 
for the most part i need to create an excel workbook w/ functions on pc & transfer to my mobile device. 
i miss database software! 
if reasonably priced & most of the functionality from windows - yes, i would use ms office on a mobile device in a heartbeat!
