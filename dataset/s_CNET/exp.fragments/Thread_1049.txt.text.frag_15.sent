i am having a similar problem with my new maxtor drive. 
it does not work on two identical dell dimension 2400s. 
they are both pentium 4 machines running xp pro 2002 sp2. 
when i power-up the drive on either machine, the usb ''new device'' message appears, but i soon get a blue screen with an error message indicating that goback2k.sys has caused a problem. 
i've disabled norton goback, but that does not help. 
am i likely having the same problem? 
will the motherboard driver mentioned in this thread work on my system? 
thanks in advance for any help!
