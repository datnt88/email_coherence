me personally, i prefer the g5 because it is true 64 bit computing as opposed to the 32-bit p4 core of the dual-core intel duo. 
(that also made me wonder why they went with intel when amd chips are 64-bit now; ah well must have been a political/financial thing.) i really hope they do a last cycle upgrade on the g5, say to 3ghz, on the powermacs before they switch to the intel chips.
