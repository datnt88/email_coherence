try doing a scandisk in dos sometimes it is just showing the wrong information and this could help if not try making a host drive that way you can store your information in one and free up a little space. 
i had done this on my old computer and it worked quit well.or 
just remove any unnecessary programs and just make links to certain windows that way you still have access to things without having to store it on your pc. just a thought to try.
