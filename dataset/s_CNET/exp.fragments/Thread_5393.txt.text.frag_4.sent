i've had my own usb hdd for 5 years and it is still going strong. 
not used much, only once a month or so. 
i have never defragged it or reformatted it. 
but beware, like any hard disks, usb hard disks can fail too, at any time, so don't use it as your only backup copy. 
usb hard disks are relatively cheap so may be you could get another?
