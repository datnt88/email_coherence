how would i go about checking that? 
because my computer says that i have 3 cd drives (i only have two) and 4 hard drives. 
it see the new one, but it won't come up in &quot;my computer&quot; and it also won't let me into it. 
also, within device manager it says disk: disk 3 type: unknown status: not initialized partition style: not applicable capacity 1907729 mb unallocated space: 0 mb reserved space: 0 mb the &quot;type&quot;, &quot;status&quot; and &quot;unallocated space&quot; ones seem wrong to me. 
do you know how to fix these? 
or change which drive letter it is? 
i figured it out once but have since completely forgeten how also, the drive is 2.0 tb not 2.1 thank you again.
