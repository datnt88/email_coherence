well after all this fuss and feathers, turns out i had switched off the primary slave in cmos in earlier attempts to isolate the problem, (which i now think was both a bad drive and/or mobo drivers). 
so i switched it back on (cmos wasn't recognizing the problem drive altho windows was, only it went to plain dma due to that, which is how it kept fooling me) everything working now, thanks to all. 
okay well i think i will put the better power supply back cheers and good night --fj
