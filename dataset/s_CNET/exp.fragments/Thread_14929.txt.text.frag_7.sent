points to the motherboard type failures. 
the power on button (did you test that button) the wires to the motherboard then the motherboard tell the psu to power up. 
there are just a few parts that involve the psu powering up. 
since the cmos battery was removed and replaced and the failure followed that, this is why i noted that. 
as to the new battery, what voltage is the volt meter reading on that battery? 
we want just over 3 volts. 
sadly if that's good and typing the dead pc at google finds nothing you can use then the motherboard id dead. 
if any other cables were unplugged i was not told about that so i have no reason to tell you to test without the ide cables plugged into the main board.
