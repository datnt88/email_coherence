i tried to burn the cd 2 more times. 
this time i was watching the light on the burner (external) and the writing light never came on at all, however the screen tells me that it was successful. 
maybe somthing wrong with burner? 
i bought it almost 1 yr ago from radio shack and have just recently tried to burn with it. 
any other suggestions. 
thanks for your help
