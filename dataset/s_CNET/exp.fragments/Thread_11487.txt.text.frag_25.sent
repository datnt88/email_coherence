thank for note d. in addition, wireless extenders, game wifi adapters (zero config ones especially), wifi cameras and more fail spectacularly without ssid broadcasts. 
it's not much of a security leak issue so i only disable it when asked to do so. 
also some drivers (even new ones) on some wifi cards fail without it. 
this advice in my view has made money for my tech friends as they roll out to fix it.
