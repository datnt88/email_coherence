hi!!! i have a hp vectra vli8 sff desktop pc (piii,600 mhz,320mb ram)with a sleek cd-rom (like the ones used in a laptop). 
this cd-rom has a strage problem. 
earlier there used to be no problem with the cd-rom. 
but lately, it is recongnizing only the cd's that are either purchased from a software vendor or that come with the hardware. 
it is not recongnizing the cd's that are written using a cd writer. 
so i have got a heap of cd's that were recognized earlier but of no use now. 
but these cd's are perfect and run well when tried on other systems.can 
anyone plz. 
help?
