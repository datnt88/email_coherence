hey i'm new to cnet. 
i am looking for something for my pc so i can play my ps2 on my pc monitor. 
i have seen vga boxes like xga but i am also looking for a new gpu and was thinking of killing 2 birds with one stone and get this... it comes with some vivo cable and a hdtv cable. 
will this fit my needs? 
if they don't what product will? 
thanks for any help.
