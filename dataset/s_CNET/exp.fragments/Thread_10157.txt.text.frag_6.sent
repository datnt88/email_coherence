i really like my 7&quot; nexus 7. it's android, and does pretty much all that you mentioned. 
there is an inexpensive otg cable that converts the mini usb port to a regular usb port. 
i've not tried it myself, but you might be able to attach a usb external hd to the nexus, or use a thumb drive. 
there are rumors that a newer, refreshed nexus 7 2 may be available as soon as july, and at the same prices as the old model, so if you can be patient, it would pay to wait a couple of months.
