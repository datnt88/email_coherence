i'm trying to load a program i got off the internet with my windows xp desktop into my windows 95 laptop using a floppy. 
seems like it can't be done because it always says to reformat the floppy. 
guess they're completely incompatible with each other? 
what i'm trying to do is recover old photos off of my laptop that i accidentally deleted. 
then i'll throw it away.
