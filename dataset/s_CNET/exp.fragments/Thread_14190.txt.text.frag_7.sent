sorry if i didn't make myself clear but i am looking into desktops but a top of the line high performing laptop too catches my eye. 
non gaming please! 
i know that toshiba has an extreme quad core notebooks and some australian company was going to come out with quad core laptops. 
so really i am just looking into high end perf for desktops and laptops i guess i will have to wait till quad becomes standard issue with at last 160gb sdd.
