hello! i'm not a technician, but i was having similar problems. 
over the weekend i discovered that i didn't need our d-link router after all because the dsl modem already was a router and they were apparently kicking each other off or something. 
in any case, i got in touch with the manufacturers of the dsl router and programmed that one. 
now everything works great and does anyone want to buy a d-link? 
lol you also need to set up for windows to configure your connection. 
good luck.
