it's not much payoff past 1gb on xp. i have seen a little payoff on just 2 games so far from 1 to 2 and those are crysis and bioshock. 
nothing else seems to care past 2.0gb. 
however the number of machines going out with 4gb is phenomenal. 
you just wonder when the questions will stop (where's my ram?) bob
