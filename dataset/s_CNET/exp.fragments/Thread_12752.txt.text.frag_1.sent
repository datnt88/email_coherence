somehow my seagate has paralyzed a partition of 3 resetting it to raw and unallocated, dividing it. 
(how i dont know) from ntfs. 
an option apart from data gathering is; to get data from an unallocated i think remaking the paramaters might help-how do you do this without reformatting, or better, can one roll the drive back to its original settings-an hope of that? 
maybe reformat it then find data?quick 
format.
