my data d has 258gb ofcourse only 1gb from this is taken while my os c has only 186gb and its the storage from this os c is taken so my question is: is this a design fault? 
and how could i store all documents and programs on my data d? 
i have an asus k55v series laptop with &quot;500gb hard disc drive storage as the sticker says&quot; as far as i can count is that also wrong and it has &quot;4gb of random acces memory as that same sticker says&quot; but if i check in cinfiguration --&gt; system and security --&gt; system i see 8gb of random acces memory and a intel core i5-3230m processor clocked on 2.6ghz so actually only the processor is the same as on the sticker :s i have still warranty and the laptop runs on windows 8 in 64 bit many thanks for your help
