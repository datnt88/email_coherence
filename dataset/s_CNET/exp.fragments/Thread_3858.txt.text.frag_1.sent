first of all, i want to thanks all the people who answered my questions, for taking so much patient to do it, i know that some questions are a little stupid, but what can i do?? :$ well, after that. 
i want to know one thing... i have a case with the option to install a cooling fan, connected to the mobo, (3 pins conector). 
but i don`t know if it`s necessary. 
the specs of my computer are: amd semprom 2800+ pcchips mobo, k7 863g 512 ram (1 ddr, 333mhz), 128mb. 
asus video card, geforce 5200fx (without cooling fan) lg cd-rw unit. 
western digital hd 7200rpm, (80gb). 
sound blaster live, audio card. 
most days (5 days per week) i leave it, on all night, and part of the day, downloading some music or games. 
so, do i need a heat extractor? 
or should i leave it, just like it`s. 
thanks a lot! 
bye
