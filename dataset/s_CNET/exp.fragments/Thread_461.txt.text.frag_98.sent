i'm on my fourth canon printer in 15 years. 
for the last 7 years i've used generic ink. 
i find the results are really worth payng 8 times less. 
the amount of ink in the replacement tanks don't go as far as canon's. 
i use a tank of ink a month for each color. 
but that goes really far, 1000 pages. 
quality seems the same, even when i make photo's on preium glossy photo paper. 
i would recommend it over refilling them yourself which can be messy.
