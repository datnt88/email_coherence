everyone has their opinion about a gaming rig. 
this cpu/that cpu......this gpu/that gpu......etc/etc. 
i think that a top of the line i5 is all the cpu you will need for gaming. 
i think that 16gb of ram is a bit of overkill....8gb might be a better fit. 
you might want to spend some time and price the combo parts one at a time. 
cpu. 
combo price.......240. 
newegg price......220.
