hi all, i am working with a sony vaio pcg-frv35. 
upon startup with battery in and plugged in, the computer will say it is running on a/c power, when it should say bettery (charging). 
if i shut down and remove battery and re-insert, start back up it works fine, runs on battery and charges correctly, even works without charger as should. 
this problem does not take more then an hour or a day to come back. the main problem is that i am not the primary user of this pc and since it is for business use, they dont want to learn how to deal with it. 
any ideas from anyone? 
by the way- we already purchased a new battery and are using it now, but the problems occurerd with the old battery as well. 
i also noticed that when i start up the laptop on battery it stays on the windows xp loading screen for about 2 mins, sometimes more, and the loading bar moves slower then usual or on charger. 
after getting insto windows the mouse moves but lags for a split second every other second or so. it doesnt clear up right away after the computer finishes loading but a couple minutes later and the mouse has no lag.
