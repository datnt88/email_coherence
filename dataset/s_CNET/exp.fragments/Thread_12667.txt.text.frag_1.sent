i dont know if anyone has ever encounter this problem, but i have a d-link di-614+ wireless router and for the past 3 to 5 month i have tried to configure the firewall to allow dcc transfers over irc (i use mirc) but to no avail, it seems that the router is not saving my configuration, i tried d-link support site, but there nothing about this topics, i updated the firmware to the latest, resetting it and nothing. 
i know the router is kind a old and is time for a upgrade but since everything else is running fine, i havent really seen the need to change. 
if i wound upgrade i was thinking of buying a linksys wireless-g broadband router or one of those new pre-n, anyways i also need to buy a new wireless pci card for my mothers desktop because the one that she has does not support wpa encryption. 
please give me your thoughts on my problem and if there anyway to fix it or if i should just upgrade to a new router. 
thanks in advance just rafy
