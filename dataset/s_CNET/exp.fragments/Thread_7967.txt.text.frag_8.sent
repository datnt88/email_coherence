any firewall can stop this from working. 
your choice on the firewall and its settings. 
before i write one more word, i offer zero support for firewalls. 
this area is one you take up with the firewall provider. 
you can keep trying this setup, but i know it's not easy to setup (witness how many firewall themselves closed) and the hardware issues. 
the router is much easier to setup. 
best of luck, bob
