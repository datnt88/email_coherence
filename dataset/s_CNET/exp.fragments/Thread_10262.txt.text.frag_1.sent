my system has 1 ide port which is taken up by the boot hard drive and the dvd drive. 
i have a second hard drive which is also ide but is connected to the 1st sata port using a sata-&gt;ide converter. 
so far, i have had no problems using this system, however recently, my much larger usb external hard drive failed. 
in looking for a replacement, i was wondering if there would be any problems if i were to use an internal sata drive for storage as well as the other two drives. 
i can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work, but i thought i'd just check before spending the cash! 
cheers
