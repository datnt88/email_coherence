unlike many other people. 
i get this message just once but it appear that none of my usb port seem to work. 
i run a winxp pro with sp2. 
i have read many discussion on how to mask the issue by disabling the error message but that does not help my port. 
everything appear to be great when i check the ports from windows but it seem like there is absolutly no power coming out of it. 
i have a 680watt power supply that i had just recently upgrade. 
any help would be appreciated. 
thank you in advance.
