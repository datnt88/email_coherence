it has to do with most people running 32-bit windows. 
those that dare to run 64-bit windows encounter issues you can research later. 
but here's the quick reasons for just 2gb. 1. windows limits application memory to 2gb. 2. even with the /3gb switch (see xp 3gb on google...) the application must be compiled with a special switch or it still is limited. 
3. read posts about xp 4gb to see that some experience slower speeds with 4gb installed. 
today i advise to stop at 2gb unless you have done more research or will not complain about the known issues.
