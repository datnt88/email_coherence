if this was my machine i'd watch for signs that a drive was on the verge of failure. the bios boot screen could read &)(*()(dvd)*)(*( instead of ld dvdrom master. 
these clues lead us to what to do next. 
also, i know to see if the firmware is current and i also will fit 80 conductor cables, set the jumpers to cs since that's my most trouble free setups. 
sadly, the drive or part with the issue didn't reveal itself (yet).
