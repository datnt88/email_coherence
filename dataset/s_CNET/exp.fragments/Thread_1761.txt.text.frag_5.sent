i bought a 420w psu and now the keyboard problem is gone. the onboard nic issue hasn't changed. 
and a day after i installed the new psu a strange thing happened. 
out of blue, windows stopped responding and the pc started making an incessant beeping sound. 
so i shut it down using the power button. 
the next time i turned the pc on the bios stopped loading at &quot;initializing usb&quot; (i looked up the hexadecimal code on the motherboard led dispay). 
this only stopped happening when i unplugged the printer from usb port. 
such a thing did not happen again. 
i'm using the printer just fine. 
everything seems to be normal. 
i guess the problem is solved for now.
