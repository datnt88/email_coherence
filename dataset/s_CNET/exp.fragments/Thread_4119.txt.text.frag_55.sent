i agree with this poster regarding windows search hogging all the system resources. 
it may not be your video card or anything else but windows indexing your computer which could take days. the best and only way to disable windows search is to right click on 'my computer' and select 'manage'. 
select 'services' on the left side of the dialogue. 
on the right side lists all the active services. 
find one called 'windows search' or 'wsearch', it may also go by 'mssearch'. 
right click on the service, select 'properties'. 
under 'startup type' select 'disabled' and make sure to 'stop' the process. 
additionally i would check your power supply. 
by adding a discrete video card like the one you did, it will consume more power and therefore could slowly beat up the one that came with your computer. 
you should have around a 700 watt power supply to run such a video card. 
some people will argue and say that a 450 watt should do the trick, but you are not talking about a big difference in cost and the 700 will run just about anything you put on it. 
if you notice the computer freezing or just rebooting on its own, replace the power supply. 
good luck.
