when the pc first boots bios and shows hardware inventory; which means u may have to disable &quot;quiet boot&quot; in bios, also &quot;report all errors&quot; or &quot;check for floppy at boot&quot; so u get an error message if floppy isn't detected. 
it also will power up the little led on the floppy briefly in test. 
once in a while, i have to unplug the floppy and power cable and replug them because floppy wasn't found. 
as said, get a cheap used floppy drive for quick replacement test and keep for backup.
