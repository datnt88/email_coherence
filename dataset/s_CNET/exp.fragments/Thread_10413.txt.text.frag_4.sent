the dark link/act lights on the switch (ports 1-4) would suggest that nothing is connected to them, though the blinking in the ''100'' row is disconcerting at best. the manual for your router can be found at the link below. 
i'd suggest removing the switch entirely from your network layout, plugging everything directly into your befw11s4 router. 
if the wired computer that is currently having issues is then able to connect, then that would suggest the switch might be a problem. 
i'd hazard a guess that the problem with your wireless computer is something unrelated. 
try logging into the router's configuration page to see if the router sees any devices connected. 
if it doesn't, check the wireless computer's wireless configuration and make sure it can see the router; also make sure it has the appropriate wep/wpa key set if you're using either security method. 
i'm a bit out of it right now so those are the only things i can think of at the moment, but hopefully that will get you started... perhaps someone else here can help you along further if you're unable to solve the issues.
