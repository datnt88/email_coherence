even today i don't recommend firewire drives on windows. 
too many times the contents have vanished so if you do that, at least someone warned you off. 
as to where the pst is, outlook can be told to point to the external drive. 
rather than duplicate the web, i'll stop here. 
does it work? 
yes. is it reliable? 
varies with each user it seems.
