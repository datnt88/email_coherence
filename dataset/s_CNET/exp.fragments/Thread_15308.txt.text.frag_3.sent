you will spend a lot more time staring into your monitor than into your pc case (unless you have a real problem with it). 
you don't want a poor quality monitor regardless of how long it lasts. 
if you can, take the time to look at a few in person. 
read some reviews as well. 
also keep in mind that an lcd image is only optimal when running in its &quot;native&quot; resolution. 
i've had good luck with viewsonic, sony, nec and a couple more. 
i have not been so fortunate with ctx, sharp, and a couple others but your experience might differ.
