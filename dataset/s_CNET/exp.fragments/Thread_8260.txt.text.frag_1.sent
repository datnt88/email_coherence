how can i expand the 2-gig primary partition on my hdd without re-formatting it beforehand? 
i've already installed win 98se (and it took over 8 hours to update it)on it and plan to soon install win 2k and win xp on the 2nd and 3rd partitions. 
when running fdisk, i didn't choose the max size for the 1st partition and it gave me a limit of no more than 2 gigs for drive c:. my hdd is 40gb and i chose 25% each for drives d and e.
