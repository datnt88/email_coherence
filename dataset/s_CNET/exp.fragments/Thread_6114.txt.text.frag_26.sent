gentlemen: i've been away from this forum since my original post. 
i purchased one device for my daughter. 
she installed it and loves it. 
it has totally cleaned up the malware she used to experience when online. 
her husband called a friend of his that runs computer security for a large credit card firm. 
his friend, a highly respected computer engineer, said his firm highly recommends the iphantom to their customers. 
i understand where everyone is coming from in this continuing debate. 
the point is that this device makes online security easily attainable for nontechnical people. 
i for one do not have any fear about govt. 
taps. 
if i were a terrorist or pedophile or downloading music, videos or software then i might be concerned that iphantom is not located offshore. 
i am grateful that our govt. is doing it's best to protect us! 
i can't go into specifics but one of our beautiful cities still exists only because a friend was able to prevent an incident from occuring because of the govt. 
ability to ''tap'' online communications. 
for that i'm grateful! 
thank you all for the educational debate! 
merry christmas and happy holidays to all.
