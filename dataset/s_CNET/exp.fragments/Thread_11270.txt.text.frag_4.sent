thank you for your replies. 
i will not get the extended warranty. 
after doing more research on this computer, i concluded that it is a great computer. 
unfortunately, i discovered that their technical support is a nightmare, but hopefully i won't need any. it seems it is difficult, if not impossible, to speak with someone at customer service if it is not related to technical support. 
thanks again.
