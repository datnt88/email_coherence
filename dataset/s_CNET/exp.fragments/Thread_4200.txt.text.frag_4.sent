ok excuse my stupidity, i'm not very computer literate. 
my computer runs slow and i assumed it was connected to the ram but if i am wrong could you please suggest what i would do to enable it to run faster. 
i gather that i must but more disk space? 
if so how do i know which disk space i am to buy. 
again, sorry for my stupidity
