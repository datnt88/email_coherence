have a good reputation for performance. the 20&quot; lcd on the imac is superb while the 30&quot; lcd is truly a sight for sore eyes. 
compared side by side with monitors of a similar size and specs, the apple monitor usually comes across as the better picture. 
however, this is all in the eye of the beholder.
