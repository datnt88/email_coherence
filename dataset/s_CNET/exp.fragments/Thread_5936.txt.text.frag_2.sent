we can't know the future for this drive. 
today's drives are made to have zero bad sectors as the drives map in spares and more. 
i must avoid a deeper discussion about how that works but when a drive fails to the point it is showing bad sectors to the os then you know to not trust it. 
that is, backup now or don't complain later.
