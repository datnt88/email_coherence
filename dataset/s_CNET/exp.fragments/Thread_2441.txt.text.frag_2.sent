while i wonder why folk think n routers have better coverage (my experience says no) since you have all the parts why not try one setup and then the next? 
you may discover your first try to work well enough to forget retrying. 
i had a wnr2000 (gifted it to my brother) and it's an ok unit. 
just update the firmware. 
as to setup, we cover that in the cnet networking forum sticky.
