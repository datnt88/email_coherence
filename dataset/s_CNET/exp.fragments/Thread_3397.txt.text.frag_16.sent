thanks for the feedback. 
i'll be shipping it soon so i definitely want to make sure everything is secure. 
and i'm not positive yet on whether i plan to overclock but it's a gift so i might leave that decision up to my boyfriend, who i'm giving it to. 
but i'll leave it running for a day or two, turn it off and make sure all connections are okay... i already tied down all the cables securely so they won't move around so much during the move but i definitely plan to open up the case to recheck everything once he opens it up on christmas, as i'll be flying to where to he is to celebrate with the family and whatnot.
