last year i decided to try netscape as my isp at half the cost of my local company. 
it worked fine. 
two months ago i finally decided to install ps2 on windowsxp. 
since then whenever i log into the internet through netscape my system crashes 5 to 15 minutes later. 
this does not happen when i am on line with the local isp. 
it also does not happen when i am doing anything off line.
