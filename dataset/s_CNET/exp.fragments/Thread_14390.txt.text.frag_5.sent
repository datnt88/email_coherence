to run vista comfortably, if you do a lot of video edditing or other memory intensive programs go to 3. i suspect that is not the case with you as you have been getting along on 512mb. 
best to buy 2 gig of quality ram which is suitable for your computer, then trying to get more and cheaper. 
i would get 2 x 1gb to match what is recomended, you should be able to still use your current module giving you 2.5gb which will be more than enough.
