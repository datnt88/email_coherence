we have (had) two computers. 
the older one is (was) a compaq with 2 wd ata hdds. 
it suddenly died today, and i'm wondering if there is a relatively painless way to transfer the data on the two ata hdds to the newer (acer) sata computer. 
no need to move programs - just data. 
any help appreciated.
