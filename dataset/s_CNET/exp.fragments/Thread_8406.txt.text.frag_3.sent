thank you, bob, for your reply. 
i am sorry for some misinformation. 
the modem is actually a adsl2+router model p-660r. 
there is no wireless. 
if you are unable to find it, it may be an older model. 
setup: dsl line to the p-660r from which cat5 cable to the p-320w (lan port instead of wan port) [ odd ? 
advanced setup ?] the main computer connects to the p-320w (lan port) with its [the main computer]nic. 
the dhcp server of the p-320w has been disabled, leaving the one at the p-660r enabled. the ip address of the p-320w has been changed slightly [to 192.168.1.0] because it is the same as that of the p-660r [192.168.1.1] the p-660r has been configured as a router instead of as a bridge. 
unfortunately, the person who performed the above set up is no longer around. 
connection type is pppoe. 
thank you for your kind attention.
