the driver order is important. 
1. the os. 2. the chipset driver (not the wifi card!!!) 3. ms uaa (see google.) 4. the audo driver. 
5. the video driver. 
6. the ethernet driver. 
7. the wifi driver. 
8. the accessories driver (i know that's vague) but this one is the one that turns on or off the wifi. 
i can't guess which one it was, you tell me.
