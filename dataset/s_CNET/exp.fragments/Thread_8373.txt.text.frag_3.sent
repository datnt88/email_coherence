did you ever get your trackball working properly? 
i have one (use win xp) that has become problematic; working 50% of the time and vice-versa. 
i have no idea what is wrong with it. 
i love the big old thing and have no idea what i should replace it with. 
are there any other die hard trackball users out there with advice about current models?
