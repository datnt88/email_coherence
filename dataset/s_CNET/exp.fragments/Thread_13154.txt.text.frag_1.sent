the on/off push button on my mom's computer doesn't seem to work anymore. 
i was wondering what the possible culprits could be. the computer is about two years old and barely gets any use from her. 
she wants to already buy a new one, but i am hoping it just needs a battery or a new power supply. 
thanks for the help
