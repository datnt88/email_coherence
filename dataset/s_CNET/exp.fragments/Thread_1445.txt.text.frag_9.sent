home routers use nat (network address translation) to share one ip address with many computers. 
this means that the router has to keep a table. 
pc1 with local address 192.168.0.50 wants to go to yahoo. 
pc2 with address 192.168.0.51 wants to go to google. the router keeps track of all connections. 
because these products only cost $50 and they have relatively small memory, they have a limited number of tcp connections that they can track. 
this type of product never advertises the highest number of concurrent sessions. 
at the opposite extreme are the real firewall products. 
one of their stats on the marketing brochure is the number of supported tcp sessions. 
the average user, with multiple open browser windows and other software typically generates between 10-15 tcp traffic flows at any one time. 
if you have an ftp or mail server running you can expect many more. 
another way to generate many tcp sessions is a computer virus or adware. the typical virus does a port scan of the internet looking for a new host to infect. 
this can generate many sessions. 
adware downloads new advertisements. 
the other aspect is the outside world. 
it typically takes less than 30 minutes for a new router or pc on the internet to get port scanned these days. 
some devices probably handle this better than others. 
check all your machines are clean. 
if that does not help, then buy a better quality router.
