it's been exactly 4 weeks since i changed my bios fan settings and it started again. 
went back in and changed the 1st 2 fan settings to normal and the reboots stopped. 
we'll see how long this lasts. 
to bad we have to troubleshoot the problem for them. 
i have not downloaded gateway's bios update yet-saving it for last resort.
