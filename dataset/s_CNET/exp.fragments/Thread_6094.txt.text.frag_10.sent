there's a shipping &quot;assistance&quot; company that recieves your orders in blaine, wa, usa. 
it's a street address so no problems with po boxes, etc. it's only a few dollars and they receive the boxes and wait for you to pick it up. 
since you are in victoria, that may be the deal breaker since you have a the ferry ride and that's costly. 
amazon.ca has lots of stuff and you have ebay.ca as well. 
i only shopped around the vancouver and richmond areas but as i would pop down to bothell from time to time i would shop down there too.
