i am buying a new dell 9100 from a reputable seller on ebay. it is loaded with everything i want except two things. 
sound card and ieee 1394 port. 
it comes with a intergrated 7.1 dolby sound card. is that going to be a problem running with some games or programs? 
also is it easy to install a ieee 1394 port? 
thank you
