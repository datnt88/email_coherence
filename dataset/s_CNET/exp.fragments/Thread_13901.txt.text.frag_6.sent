you got a replacement hd already and installed. 
now, you don't want to return the old hd back because you deem the data too personal. 
while that maybe true, how can you blame dell for that? 
they await the return of the hd in order for &quot;you&quot; to honor the warranty process. 
it has already suggested to use a hd wiping pgm. 
in order to remove any data. 
if you can't do this, again how is it dell's fault. 
that's up to you to decide to proceed with the eraser process and then return the hd. you will need to mount the hd in such a way to access your old system or another. 
the current replacement hd can be unplugged and plug the old one back in, in order to wipe it clean. 
it doesn't have to be screwed or physically mounted as before but have access to the hd port to proceed. 
any other way will be a cost factor involved. 
if your computer savvy enough to accomplish this, its a done deal, excluding a truly damaged hd that can't power-on or similar. 
otherwise keep the hd and face whatever action dell may deem necessary.
