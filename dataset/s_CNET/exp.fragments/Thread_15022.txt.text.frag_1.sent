this probably is a dummy question, but i'm very new to wireless usage, so maybe someone can provide the info i need. 
thanks in advance for any information. 
i live in the south. 
there is a church near my house which has a school as a part of its operation. 
last year i bought a laptop equipped with the hardware necessary for wireless connections. 
for a few months i got a message on firing up the laptop that a wireless connection had been detected. 
i don't know if it was the church's connection or not, although i suspected it was because it was the largest quasi-business use nearby. 
i figured it probably was and didn't try connecting, and several months ago, i stopped getting the message. 
early this year the local mullet wrapper printed a story about the county's looking into providing a county-wide wireless system for the general public. 
in the meantime, the local library system has established wireless servers (?)at each of its branches; yesterday i went to one of the branches and finally learned how to actually use a wireless connection. 
this morning, before i left for the library branch that i used yesterday, i decided to use my dialup connection at home. 
after the laptop warmed up, i got the &quot;wireless connection detected&quot; message. 
so, i connected and am nowing using it; it is about as fast as a dsl connection. is it possible that the connection i'm using is, in fact, the county library's system and that the coverage of the system is a lot wider than they've let on publicly? 
in other words that i don't need to go to the branches? 
the only thing that makes me think this isn't correct is that a lady at the library who was also using her laptop said that a certain spot in that branch did not have as good a connection as where we were.
