firmware is not the same as driver. 
firmware is embedded software that is part of a hardware device like your modem/router. 
usually you can visit the modem/router vendor's website and under support check to see if there is an update to the firmware for the given hardware device. 
most modem/router vendors provide a mechanism either through their web administration front-ends or a separate program to install the latest version of firmware for the hardware device. 
your web administration should also show you what version of firmware that is currently running on the device so you can verify that you are either behind latest or up-to-date. 
i would check your firmware and get that up-to-date and then reply back if you still are having problems. 
you may also want to search the support knowledgebase of the modem/router vendors website to see if other users of their devices have had similar symptoms as you. 
they may have advice there that can help.
