time you're doing something like this ...it pays to be backed up, just in case. 
re which way to do it...your call. 
even though it says 'move'.... my guess it actually does it in sequence the way i suggested. 
if you're not 100% sure of the other way ... i'd try the one i suggested or else why ask for help ? 
let us know how it turns out.
