open to suggestions.. i cannot route any network traffic nor create a back-end dedicated network for network backups between these servers. the buffalo is 4-disk hot-swap raid nas..only i cannot network the servers together. 
i will look into connecting the buffalo to my kvm and try that. 
disable/enable usb port on the server to correlate with backup times?
