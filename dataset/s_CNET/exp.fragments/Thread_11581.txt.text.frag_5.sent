thank you kees bakker for your comment actually i'm using thomson tg585 v7 and it's g not n so it is too slow and its range is too bad. 
my house has built from concrete and bricks. 
for the range, i need something more than 1000 ft in my country there are no linksys wrt610n and netgear wndr3700, so i will order everything from amazon or any website. 
regards, khaled
