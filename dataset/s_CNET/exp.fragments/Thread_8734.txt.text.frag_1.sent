i am running a 2100s rev320r i20 scsi v001.38 in raid5 we want to upgrade the drives to 300gb. 
according to documentation i should go into storage manager mark the drive as failed, replace it with the new drive, let it rebuild then repeat the process for each drive. 
i have installed storage manager' version 4.40.00 (16593) but it tells me that no controllers were found.
