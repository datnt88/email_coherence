okay. i'm asking what processor should i get, not graphics card because i already know what i'm getting. 
i'm not editing videos or anything like that. 
all i'll be doing with the computer is playing the latest games. 
what i mean by overheating is, i don't want the cpu to get hot so fast (high temperature) and causes the computer to have major problems or just overall low performance.
