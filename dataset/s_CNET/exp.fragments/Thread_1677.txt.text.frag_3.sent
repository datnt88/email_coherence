first, you've picked a $190 motherboard and saddled it with a low-end cpu. 
also, the motherboard supports sli, but you've chosen a video card that needs crossfire. 
and if this is a gaming machine, the x1300xt is barely adequate. 
if you're getting your stuff from newegg, that kit totals to $550 (cpu 170 + mobo 190 + graphics 82 + ram 105). 
here's a better build sticking with amd. 
cpu: athlon64 x2 4600+(65w), $217, mobo: msi k9n4 sli, $88, (2nd choice: asus m2n-e, $97) graphics: xfx 7900gs extreme, $180 ($30 rebate) ram: ocz gold 1gb kit, $105 $590 ($560 after rebate) gets you a faster cpu, same mobo functionality except firewire, and a video card that at least 3x faster than the x1300xt. 
you'll also be able to add another 7900gs in the future but one 7900gs is plenty fast for most games. 
here's an intel kit: cpu: core2duo e6400, $222 (2nd choice is e6300 which is mobo: biostar tforce965pt, $107 graphics: his x1950pro, $177 ($20 rebate) (2nd choice is xfx 7900gs extreme cited earlier) ram: ocz gold 1gb kit, $105 $611 ($591 after rebate) has the same improvements over your original components. the extra $30 gets you a faster cpu than the x2 4600+.
