i submitted a support request to gateway and they'll send a replacement nvidia card under warranty. 
that's good because i didn't want to have to wipe my hard drive and ship the entire pc back for just a card relacement. 
to submit the request for replacement graphics card: 1. do the troubleshooting procedurehere: 2. go to 3. click &quot;contact support&quot; tab 4. click &quot;e-mail technical support&quot; link 5. explain your problem and the results of the troubleshooting procedure. 
ask for a replacement video card if the card has failed. 
6. you should get a computer-generated email and then later an email response from a gateway support person. 
you may need to re-iterate that you want a replacement card sent. 
7. you'll be requested to provide address/phone info and go to a secure web site to place a pre-authorization on a credit card (card not charged). 
8. you should receive the replacement card in the mail within a few days. 
you'll have 7 days to send back the failed card. 
otherwise, your credit card will be charged if you don't send the failed card back in time. 
seems simple enough, so hopefully this all works out and the new card lasts longer than 10-11 months.
