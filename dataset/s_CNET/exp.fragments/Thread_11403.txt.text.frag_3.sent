so, might you suggest i reset my router settings (not back to factory condition, per se, so as not to lose all of the firmware updates) once everything is hooked up? 
because once everything was hooked up and we had the router setup cd in telling us no connection could be detected, we just reconnected our old dsl and left it. 
i didn't check the router setup page (although the setup screen was full screen, so not sure i would have been able to minimize it). 
let me know as i can try this later.
