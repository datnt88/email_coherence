hi, i'm running a wireless network using a belking g router, with wpa2-psk authentication and aes encription. 
i'd like to wirelessly connect my new macbook pro running xp to this network. 
the properties box says the mac has an atheros ar5006x wireless network adapter. 
it currently runs the default windows wireless utility, which has only wpa-psk, *not* wpa2-psk. 
my installed atheros driver is ver. 
4.2.2.27 from 17/07/2006. is there a specific atheros configuration utility i can use? 
is there a generic (open-source) one? 
i've searched the web and haven't been able to find one. 
i found some atheros drivers that may contain such a utility, but they're older than the driver i have. 
failing that, how can i use the windows utility to configure the mac to use wpa2? 
thanx, nir
