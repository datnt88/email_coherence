i flashed the bios to the latest (still old) just to make sure it wasn't that: new bios: bios date: 09/17/03 bios type: phoenix - awardbios v6.00pg bios id: 09/17/2003-nvidia-nforce-6a61bf09c oem sign-on: version tfa43 no difference, still corrupt though not as bad perhaps, though the intermittent and variable aspect of this corruption makes it hard to tell. the aiw is around three years old. 
i do have a comax pci slot agp fan blasting on the 9700pro in addition to the stock fan. 
i have to leave for an hour or so, so will try the cooling and cleaning (i keep it pretty clean) test. 
i'll give a report when i get back. 
thanks for your input.
