i have an intel q6600 quad processor, and it is the best processor that i have ever had in a computer. 
go for the quad over a dual, since when you need it, you will have power to spare. 
i also have 4 gig of ram, and every program on my computer launches in 2 to 10 seconds, their operation is also speedy. 
i have pinnacle studio 10 on this new computer and it edits videos quickly and smoothly. 
i had it on an older one with a hyperthreading processor and 2 gig of ram, and this program was a lot less speedy on that one. 
if you get the q6600, you will never be sorry, and have a computer that will last you many years into the future, at least until they come up with a 8 core processor!!!! ha! ha!
