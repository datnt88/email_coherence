so i do mainly use windows, but for programming and as a development server i like to use linux. 
i just built a new machine, and all was well and good until i needed linux. 
i put in the may 2007 edition of ubuntu and started up under the disc. 
i hit the install button and tried to have it resize my windows partition, which being the greedy little fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads it was had taken up my whole hard drive. 
after several hours it was still at the 0% mark, so (here is probably where it went wrong. 
this was pretty stupid of me) i shut down my machine because i couldnt get it to respond. 
i thought it turned out all right until i went to my computer in windows and saw that it thought my hard drive was 20 gigs. 
i cant figure out how to fix it, so could someone recommend some free software to fix the issue? 
or if xp pro has something built in, that would be even better
