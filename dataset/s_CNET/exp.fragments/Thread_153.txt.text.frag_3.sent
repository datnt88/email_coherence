thank you for your reply. 
i am from canton, massachusetts regarding if a computer is new: how do you know its not a reseller they partner with? 
you responded to look at different models, not prices. 
when cnet gives a top rating to a particular model, i assume it refers to all the models regardless of the numbers after it? 
thanks again.
