but in short you can create a wider area if you use routers as access points or aps. 
this is the cnet discussion forum (nothing to do with cnet routers) so you are not on a cnet router support site. 
this is where people discuss things and help another. 
since you didn't give links to the manual i'll just note the usual method.
