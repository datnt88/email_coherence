only one of those jacks is for the phone line, the other is for an external phone so that you don't need to put a splitter on the line. 
if you look carefully at the jack one end says line and the other says phone, or they have a picture of a wall jack and a phone right next to the jacks. 
try plugging in a phone to the phone side and see if you still have the problem. 
if what you describe is truly happening then it is time to replace the modem. 
you could try using a splitter to run the phone line into each side, that way you never have the line in the wrong place.
