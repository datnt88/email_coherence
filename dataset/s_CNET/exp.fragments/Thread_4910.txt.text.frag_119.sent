i also had to replace the video card in one of mine as well. 
the fan motor was burnt...literally...it was black/charred and obviously non-operational. 
as others mentioned i also moved the wireless card down further to give more area for heat dissipation when i installed the new video card. 
hard to believe all the common problems i've read about with these 5485's.
