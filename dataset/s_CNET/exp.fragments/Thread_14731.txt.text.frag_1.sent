today i left my computer on when i went to school. 
we are trying to sell our house and had a showing, so my mom yanks the power cord out of the wall to hide it. 
now, my secondary internal 1 tb drive doesn't show up anywhere. 
not in my computer. 
not in device manager. 
it is just gone. it was working perfectly until this happened. 
please help. 
i need the data on this hard drive. 
computer is a widows 7 desktop.
