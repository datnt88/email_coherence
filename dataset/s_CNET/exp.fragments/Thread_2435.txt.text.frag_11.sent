the addition of an lmhosts file did the trick! 
thank you to all who posted. 
i didn't change anything else. 
this was a problem that developed slowly. 
when i first set up the network, everything worked fine. 
my network slowly lost the ability to resolve computer names. 
perhaps this will help someone else.
