rdram is relative expensive ($30 for 256mb) and cpu-wise you'd have to search for a used processor in the 2.2-2.4ghz 
range ($30) and *hope* it works. 
add a decent 256mb agp card ($70) and you've spent $120 (and a lot of effort) or so on a pc that is still way behind the curve and far slower than any new dual-core $400 pc.
