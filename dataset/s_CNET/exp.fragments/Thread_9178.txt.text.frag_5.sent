i dont have access to my routers settings at this time. 
but im sure it was set up properly since i have put many hours in research getting the proper settings for my specific router. 
i guees my main question is.....do routers tend to need replacing after a number of years??....i know there have been upgrades since my last purchase and more or less leaning to a new router..
