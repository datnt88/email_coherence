as to waking up, it could be just a matter of the bios set to wake on usb activity. 
or you researching the use of the windows scheduler. 
from memory, the current versions of windows 7 can wake from sleep when scheduled. this is not an offer to write the app but to chat about how to research it further. 
and to share that apps on windows mobile up to 6.5 is fairly easy with visual studio pro 2008. 
i demo &quot;your first app in 5 minutes&quot; on that so it can't be more than a few days for your average programmer to have their first wm apps out and running. 
i think my pharos m619 tops out at 2 watts with everything going (gps, cell phone, wifi and bluetooth.) so it makes for a fine little data collector. 
and with the cell phone it can email home the data.
