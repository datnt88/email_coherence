i have a microsoft wireless comfort desktop 5000 keyboard / mouse and the snap in mini 2.4 ghz wireless usb mini transceiver is damaged. 
microsoft does not sell just this part you have to buy a new combo set. 
does any other brands have one that will work with this model and where might i buy one? 
being it is very light duty it is fragile so i am wondering if it is worth finding one or is there a better system wireless keyboard / mouse that is a bit more durable? 
i have gone thru 3 microsoft models so far one had the space bar stop working, the next was the corded transceiver would come and go and now this. it is for home use mostly. 
any suggestions? 
i am trying to keep it under 75.00 if possible i have spent about 325.00 on the three i have had... buy would prefer to just buy a replacement tranceiver if there is such a thing that will work this this keyboard / mouse???
