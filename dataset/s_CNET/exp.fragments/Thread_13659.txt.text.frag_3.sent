thank you, those are both great deals. 
i have started thinking about getting a new card. the only reason i didnt already was because i have a 3 year warranty with pny. 
out of those two you showed, i would perfer the one with the heatsink and fan (8800gs) just to prevent future overheating. 
i havent heard nice things about the &quot;silent&quot; cards. 
any other suggestions
