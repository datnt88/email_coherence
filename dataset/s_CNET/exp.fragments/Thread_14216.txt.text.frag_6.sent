i recently bought a netgear wn2000rpt unit within 5 minutes the extender was up and running and a strong-excellent signal across the first floor of our house. 
if you want to use an old netgear router, i have also tried this in the past and took it wired into another part of the house; not as flexible though as the above wireless unit. 
hope this is helpful.
