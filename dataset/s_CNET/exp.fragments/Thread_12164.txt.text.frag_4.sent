dawn_swe something to think about. 
world's fastest supercomputers employ amd opteron(tm) processors to reach unprecedented performance 3 of the top 5 systems and 7 of the top 20 systems depend on amd innovation top 20 showing for amd opteron processors outpaces any other x86 processor architecture by almost 2:1 dresden, germany, jun 18, 2008 (business wire) -- at the international supercomputing conference, amd (amd) today announced that its amd opteron(tm) processors have helped deliver many of the top performing supercomputers in the world. 
for the first time ever, amd technology plays a role in the number one supercomputer in the world and this same processor technology that helps drive the number one supercomputer is also readily available for business and personal computing my prediction? 
someday, amd will leave intel in the micro dust. 
this doesn't help you much with buying your computer today, but it's still something to think about. 
good luck, greybear70
