i too have been stung by this company. 
i had seen some of the bad reviews before purchasing from them, but figured i would be ok. i bought my daughter a n90 yuanda tablet for her christmas. 
very quick delivery and to be fair it has been a good enough tablet for the money (&#163;139.99) but i noticed last week it had developed a mark on the screen, in the shape of a circle, right in the middle of the screen. 
its as if the display has kind of &quot;burn out&quot; in that area. 
i contacted them by email and even attached a video of me showing the mark for proof. 
their answer was for me to return it to china at my expense (&#163;50 by dhl) to have it fixed and for me to pay the return postage. 
i would be cheaper buying a new tablet!? what with their very broken english and resistance to help any further, i have to say i have kind of given up. 
i have told them i would be leaving negative feedback everywhere i could, and got no further response. 
they really don't care. 
i knew i took a gamble buying from china but please don't anyone else take that risk.
