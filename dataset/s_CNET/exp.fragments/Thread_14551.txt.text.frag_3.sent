well that file definitely is necessary on the boot process. 
you could have different solutions here. 
here is mine. 
problem first the corrupted file name is ntoskrnl.exe, 
which is located in c:windowssystem32ntoskrnl.exe &lt;---- &quot;bad file&quot; windows cannot locate this file or the file is just bad. 
solution you need to eliminate this file a get a new one. 
you can do the following if you get a copy of windows xp. i can probably help you with the cd, i'm located in dallas,tx. 
let me know of your options anyways. 
1. insert windows xp cd. 2. reboot the computer, as the computer is starting you should see a message to press any key to boot from the cd. when you see this message press any key. 3. in the windows xp initial menu press the r key to enter the recovery console. 
4. inside the console type expand d:i386ntoskrnl.ex_ 
c:windowssystem32 6. you will then be prompted if you wish to overwrite the file type y and press enter to overwrite the file. 
7. type exit to reboot the computer. 
hope this help.
