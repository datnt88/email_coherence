same thing happened to me. the fan on the graphics card will take a dump soon. 
it's not up to the task. 
i bought another card from a different maker, but still the 8500gt and have been very happy since. it has a larger heat sink where the fan is mounted. the computer is quieter than when new and the fan has never gone into overspeed condition.
