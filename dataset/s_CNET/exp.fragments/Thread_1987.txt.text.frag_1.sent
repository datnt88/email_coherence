i have a computer with xp. lets call it pc1. it has a wireless card that connects to a router for the internet. 
a printer is hooked up to pc1. 
i have another computer pc2 with windows me hooked up to pc1 with a cross over cable. the conection works for the internet, but when i bring in a laptop with a wireless conection to pc1 it wont let me print. 
i cant connect pc2 to the router. 
i shared the printer and files when i went thru the wizard. 
i checked the printer and its shared. 
not sure where to go.
