the devices can reside on the network and can be accessed. 
they just cannot be accessed by simply browsing the network unless another pc in its workgroup is also on. 
but, i know how to find the device by using its name or address and can map the drive or shares, create desktop links, etc. other users in the school won't know how to do this. 
i don't care to visit every pc in the school that might need access to this nas. 
anyone can browse a network and click on what shows up. 
not everyone knows about drive mapping. 
since both devices exhibit this same behavior, i'm thinking its and issue with a service or some network setting causing this but the device doesn't have windows explorer installed. 
it has a very limited shell. 
i'm not unhappy with it. it works quite well and is fairly simple to configure via a web browser. 
perhaps you have a better understanding than i do of what a master browser is in a peer-to-peer network. 
for some reason i'm thinking this hiccup is related to that need.
