i think i'm one of the unlucky goobers who's forray into hard drive replace has turned into a nightmare. 
the physical instillation went great, and bios recognizes the new drive because all the specs and info are there. 
but when i pop in my windows xp system recovery disks and try to boot from them, i receive the following error message: &quot;no hard disk found. 
system recovery cannot be continued!&quot; 
i'm running a hp pavillion 743c, with windows xp and original hard drive of 80gbs. the new drive i'm trying to install is a 250gb western digital eide drive. 
any suggestions at all would be super appreciated. 
when i purchased these system recovery disks from hp, they assured me i could use them to completely reformat the drive. 
now i'm wondering if they hosed me out of $25 for 12 disks that might not actually do anything. 
thanks so much!
