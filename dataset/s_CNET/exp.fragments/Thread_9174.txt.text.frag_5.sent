just be happy it works when you need it. 
understanding the &quot;engneering&quot; side gets too detailed and/or the nuts/bolts that many really don't want to know other than what i stated. 
here's a link to explain some of it: understand that alot of h/w that's part of the mtrbd. 
or basic &quot;sold as is&quot; system will be defaulted, thus any added h/w usually needs more attention in order for it to work. the system keeps track of it and &quot;allows&quot; a certain range of available irqs to represent those items.
