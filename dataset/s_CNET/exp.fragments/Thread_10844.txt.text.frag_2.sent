question 1 - why does the hard drive need to be partitioned and formatted? 
answer: because no operating system works with an unpartitioned and unformatted hdd...even if it's only a single hdd with a single partition. 
question 2 - how is partitioning and formatting done? 
i read in one particular cnet response, that all you had to do in windows was to go to &quot;disk management&quot; to complete this task, however, i have searched and can not even find &quot;disk management&quot; on my computer. 
go to: start settings control panel administrative tools computer mgmt disk mgmt
