i've experienced your problem, but on my case it was a cd-writer. 
did you install any hardware together with it's device driver recently? 
if so check if your device driver is digitally designed for windows xp, if not then that is your culprit! 
many pc user's are ignorant on the importance of having any pc hardware and device driver digitally designed, if not it will create different problems for your os, including your case. 
on my experience, i couldn't fix the problem even after 3 consecutive reformats and windows xp reinstallations. 
i've upgraded my os from windows xp home to windows xp pro and that solved the problem. 
try upgrading your os or reverting it to any previous versions of windows, then after sometime reformat your hardrive and install your current copy of windows xp but avoid installing the hardware that caused your problem.
