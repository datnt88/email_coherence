ok so i own the same computer: and am looking to upgrade so i can play elderscrolls oblivian. 
i was looking at the nvidia e-geforce 6200 le 256mb ddr2 pcie video card: will this work with the computer. 
it has the pci express slot but i wasn't sure if vista, the motherboard, or the onboard radeon xpress 1100 would cause problems when i put in the new nvidia. 
thank you
