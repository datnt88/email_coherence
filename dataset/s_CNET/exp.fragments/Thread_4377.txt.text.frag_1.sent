i have an hp 4ml printer (yes, one that works with a mac as well as a pc) that has a little bit of paper stuck on the roller. 
actually, a whole sheet of paper rolled around the roller. 
i'd really prefer to keep it going until i upgrade both my system and my computers (a desktop g4 and laptop g3). 
i managed to pull a lot of the paper out of the computer, but there's still a little bit in there, and i can't get hold of a leading edge. 
does anyone know how to advance the roller so i can get at it? 
i have no guarantee that that will do the whole trick (a wee bit of the rubber from the roller fell out when i got hold of the majority of the paper), but i'd surely like to try to get the last bit of paper out and see. the only place i know of, here in new york city that might be willing to repair it will charge $100+ to do the job (and if i need a new roller, it will be more), and there aren't many printers around, it would seem, that will work with the system i'm using. 
(os 9.2.2--i have my reasons.) please don't give me helpful advice about why i shouldn't be using os 9 anymore. 
i appreciate the good will but couldn't act on it right now. 
just, please, if you know how to make the roller advance, tell me. 
if i can't do that, or if the dear old laserject refuses to work even after i get the paper bit(s) our and clean it, i'll come back and ask for more help, ok? thanks so much, in advance.
