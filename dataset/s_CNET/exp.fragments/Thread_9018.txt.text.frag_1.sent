i am trying to access my usb flash drive. 
it was encripted using bitlocker. 
i am running windows 64 bit ultimate. 
when i insert the drive it says it needs to be fornatted. 
the drive capacity is full though so i am assuming the files are there. 
this was after i had to reinstall windows. 
i have a copy of the certificate in the personal information format but this is no help. 
any ideas? 
thank you
