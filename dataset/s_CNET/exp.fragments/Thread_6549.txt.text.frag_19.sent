i spoke to dell themselves and they had nothing on their knowledge base about this issue which i think is amazing. the tec said to me they would normally just swop the keyboard over so i'm assuming that this is a well known problem that they aren't admitting to as it;s a design fault. 
you'll note that they have discontinued the product. 
did any one manage to find out where to get the spare power part from? 
thanks
