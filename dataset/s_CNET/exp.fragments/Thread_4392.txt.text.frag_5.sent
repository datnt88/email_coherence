i would like to know if you resolved this issue since i am having the same problem. 
i have tried to install the card (h/w rev b2) in an xp sp2 machine and none of the drivers can be found (tried the original cd and 3 downloaded drivers from d-link). 
i thought it was related to the sp2 upgrade. 
this card was working fine in a win98 machine.
