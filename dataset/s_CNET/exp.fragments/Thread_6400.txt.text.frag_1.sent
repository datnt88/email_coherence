i have an intel d845pebt2 motherboard with the latest bios. 
on my secondary ide bus i have a plextor px-708a dvd burner (master) and a tdk dvdrw420n burner as the slave. 
when i boot xp pro and try to read a photocd (.pcd) in plextor drive, it asks to put in disk , then it says can't read from disk. 
yet when i put it into the tdk drive it has no problems. 
now - i have played with htis and that settings, and finally i found that if i go to device manager and remove the plextor drive, then have it search and install new hardware , that now it will act right, at least till i reboot, or if i follow the advice and reboot - it will work properly that instance as it installs the device on that cycle, but won't acknowledge the .pcd 
disk upon hte following reboot. 
any ideas how i can fix this , or why this is happening - and only to my master drive?--
