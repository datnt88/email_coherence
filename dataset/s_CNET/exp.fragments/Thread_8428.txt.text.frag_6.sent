for my dlink and linksys here, it returns it to the factory settings. 
it will be a dhcp server so i can boot the pc connected to the lan ports and port the web browser at it to configure it. the linksys has one other option and that's the usb configuration, but i don't suggest that since for some, usb things have issues.
