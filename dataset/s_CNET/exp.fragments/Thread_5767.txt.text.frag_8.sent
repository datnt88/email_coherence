thanks for the detailed answer...now, out of curiosity and a desire to learn, what does on-board ram do? 
who does it benefit? 
my limited understanding tells me that more ram will benefit gamers because the textures in 3d games are loaded into the gpu's ram instead of the system ram, but i don't know if this is correct. 
i had thought that everything displayed on the screen was loaded into ram in which case opening a large file in photoshop would use more graphics card ram than a small file. 
am i mistaken?
