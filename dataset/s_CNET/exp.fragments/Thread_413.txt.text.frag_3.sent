using theirs would be fine. 
they don't make one. 
we are talking about something that plugs into a parallel port and connects a printer to an ethernet network. 
i had one that connected through the appletalk port, but no longer works because of snow leopard. 
if you know for a fact that apple makes one, i will be as delighted as surprised.
