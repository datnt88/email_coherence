the exact model is hp pavillion m7570n my budget?? well, i am not really sure what a decent cost would be for something like this. 
i want to try to keep it on the lower end if possible. the video card i installed in my old computer was something i just picked up at walmart for $100. 
i realize this will be a bit more expensive, but i don't want to be getting up to $1000 or anything, we just can't afford that. 
i am fine with taking things apart and putting them back together, like i said, i have installed video cards, extra hard drives, etc. as long as i have instructions i can do just about any of that stuff. 
and, i have no problem buying over the internet. 
that is how we do most of our shopping now since katrina thanks for replying!!!
