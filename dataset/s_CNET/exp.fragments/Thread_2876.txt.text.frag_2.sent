you gave no mention of your system specs/details. 
on this matter a replacement dvd in lieu of the cd drive will be ok. just drop it in and set the jumpers, ect. 
to your needs. 
most retail boxed dvd drive will have the help guide and any r/w software required. 
beware, the dvd may not be seen as a dvd and the s/w is important as if xp based system won't follow the easy drop to disk writing, you'll need that provided s/w. 
as for brands i suggest the hp, lg, or lite-on and maybe sony. 
if you desire &quot;lightscribe&quot; option that's up to you.
