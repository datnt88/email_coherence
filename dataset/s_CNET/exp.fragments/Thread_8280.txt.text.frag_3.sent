if it were me and i wasn't going to use the pc after getting the mac, i'd continue as you're doing now. 
once you get the mac and get the pics moved, then take the pc hdd, put it in an external enclosure and use it as extra backup. 
you might also consider putting your important stuff on dvds and store them offsite ... just in case.
