i have a imac and have a microsoft office keyboard (has a usb connector) connected to it and it works fine. 
i did not need to load any drivers to use it. 
keep in mind that the start key is the key that represents the apple and the start key is your option key. 
i thought i would try to see if it works and have been using it for about a month now
