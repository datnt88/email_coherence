well, i'm pretty sure you're right with the router bug idea. 
my neighbour has a different make router (netgear) and he's given me the pass code to access it, and it connects straight away and there are no problems with router! 
i'm able to use his wireless perfectly!! well, off to the shop i'll be going for a new router! 
think i'll get a netgear one too as this seems to work ok! thanks for your help.
