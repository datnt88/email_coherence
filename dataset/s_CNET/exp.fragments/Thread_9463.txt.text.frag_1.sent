i have a sound blaster audigy 2zs. 
all sound from the speakers works, but when i try to use a microphone it doesnt pick up any sound. 
ive checked all the advanced options and it isnt muted anywhere. 
i tested the hardware but it never picks up any sound. 
all the sound drivers under the device manager work, except for one driver, called &quot;multimedia audio controller, which is labeled as unknown. 
what i dont get is that the mic worked with this exact setup a month ago, and it just stopped working one day. 
i tried the mic in another computer and it worked, so i know it is not the mic itself. 
i've tried updating the drivers from the creative website and everything. 
any help would be appreciated.
