if your os is xp, you will want service pack 2 installed prior to your first time connection if possible. 
your broadband connection should also connect through a router which has a nat (hardware) firewall. 
this is a deterent and not totally secure, however. 
you will want a decent browser and e-mail handler and the two that come from ms with xp are not on the &quot;good&quot; list. 
you can also install a software firewall but these may take some tweaking to make them work as you wish. 
i use the free sygate product. 
i don't know if it's ever blocked an attack but that's not what's most important. 
lastly, an overlooked defense is ones personal care while surfing. 
some would say never jump off a building without a parachute. 
i say, never jump off a building. 
hope that helps.
