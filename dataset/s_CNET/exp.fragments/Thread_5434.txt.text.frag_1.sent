i have a dell 8300 2 years old. 
i can only boot into safe mode because i'm having xp home issues. 
i need to move important files (20gb worth - movies and mp3s) to something and i'm purchasing an external hard drive soon. 
question is, can i move those files to the external hd when i can only boot to safe mode? 
if so, how do i do that?
