i have no idea what you did. 
my flash disk is 1 gb, ~~ properties show 650 mb used, 350 mb free. 
in attempting to add any file, i recieve the error &quot; the directory or file cannot be created&quot; i have win xp. obviously i was able to. 
initally write on the disk and can read the existing files i created on it. 
could i have accidently changed the file sysyem ? 
file system properties shows my &quot;c&quot; drive ntfs but the &quot;f&quot; drive (flash disk) is fat.
