were installed in the laptop using vista, correct? 
you have the vista drivers for the printer? 
downloaded from here you installed the lexmark x1250 into the desktop and have it set to be able to share printing. 
so what i'm seeing here is the problem that was put in the forum sticky , about printer sharing on xp vista network(post 12). 
let me know how you make out.
