use what works best. 
autochannel will cause drops in my experience and is proper to do so. 
think about why. 
think about how to do a site survey. 
i have a laptop and my palm tx which i can view networks and what channel they are on. 
you'll have to dream up something or just try 1 then 5 then 11 and see what works best. 
as to wzc, that's another one to try enabled and disabled.
