from radeons, because their install cd and drivers drive me batty. 
[no pun intended]. 
the cd installs so much crap that i have no idea what it does, don't want it, and don't want to take the time to read about it and never use it, except to have it create problems. 
lol i already had two monitors using the jaton cheapie [its nvidea] that i have, but then decided to give the monitor to my granddaughter. 
but i never really got a handle on ways to use the dual monitors. 
want to find ways to set things up &quot;permanently&quot; so i don't always have to drag things from one screen to the other, or have dialog boxes for actions on the first screen show up on the second screen. 
i kept forgetting to look there. 
lol believe it or not i have never played a game on a pc [or anything else]. 
too afraid that i will fail miserably and reveal my eye hand coordination inadequacies, to myself. 
lol thanx again.
