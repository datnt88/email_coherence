they cost around $25 and you can buy them in most stores that sell computers. 
be sure to get the right size (2.5&quot; or 3.5&quot; and type (ide or sata). 
put the drive in the enclosure and plug it into a usb slot. 
windows will recognize it and assign it a drive letter where you can access it with computer (aka windows explorer). 
good luck.
