question on ext hd care, u shouldn't move it while it's transferring data.... the ext hd should also be set as flat as possible right, or does that not really play a big of a role in operation failures (e.g. parot of it is lying ontop of a coaster or small book so it's angled) as far as reliability, there's some faith in addition to a good brand. 
maxtor ide hds are supposed to be among the top. 
my roomate installed a new one, moved (not copied) some stuff over. 
it crashed shortly!! and this was a brand new hd!! he lost all the stuff he moved, luckily none of which was important. 
he called maxtor, they sent him a free replacement, and it's been working fine for years now.
