i set up a network, with windows xp, 2000 prof., and 98se, using a linksys router and a netgear hub. 
i have an adelphia cable modem. 
i am able to access the internet with all three pc's now. 
but, i am unable to receive email using outlook express or outlook, i always used both o. express and outlook before, but now i can only send using them. 
i am still able to receive emails if i go to adelphia's website, and i put my emails forwarded to my gmail account, and i can receive my email thru gmail as well as my gmail, i just cannot receive thru oe or outlook. 
i get a failed error mess. 
{protocol pop3, port-995, secure (ssl) no, socket error 10060, error #0x800cccoe} message. 
no setting with oe or outlook were changed. 
gmail was forwarded to oe, and will not receive there either. 
neither linsys cust. 
serv. 
nor netgear were able to help, and adelphia won't.
