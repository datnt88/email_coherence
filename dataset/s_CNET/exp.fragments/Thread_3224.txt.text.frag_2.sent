you should check the &quot;fit&quot; of the power sw. to the case. 
not always but sometimes, a physical obstruction due the case skin or path is causing the sw. to be stuck. 
you can better fit the case(relocate) for the best operation, plus clean and lube(use spray wax) to lessen stickness. 
however, some sw. do surcome to wear&tear and replacement is recommended, of course you then need emachine support for that. 
these sws. are simple in design and offer little in repair but replace and above advice.
