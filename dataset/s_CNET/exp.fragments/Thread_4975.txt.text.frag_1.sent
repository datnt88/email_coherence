i have a dell dimension 1100 desktop computer and a panasonic viera tv (model tx-32lxd69a), which is lcd. 
i want to connect the processor to the tv, so that i can watch movies and tv programmes streamed through my computer on my tv screen. 
could i do this by using a hdmi cable to hdb15? 
see link below for details of cable.
