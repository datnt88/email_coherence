i have an asus a7v133 v 1.05 motherboard w/bios v.1009. 
my 1ghz athlon seems to work fine but i need help setting bios to run athlon xp2100+. the settings so far seem to hang. 
at the time i bought it, the motherboard was found to be able to take up to athlon 2100, i didn't realise the + made a difference and i can't get it to run. is there any upgrades available for this. 
any new bios that can handle this?. thanks for the help.
