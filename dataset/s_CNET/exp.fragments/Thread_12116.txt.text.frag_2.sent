trw, i think for most smb needs you can get by with a solid consumer (retail) desktop system. 
without fully understanding your needs or budget im sure you could easily get by with a core i5 based system (intel's latest but not highest end processor). 
you can pick up a core i5 system for ~$800 or so (that probably includes a new monitor). 
it will run all your office apps and autocad very well and ensure you can also run the next several generations of the sw in years to come. 
machines from dell, asus, gateway and hp are going choices timwoodchip disclosure: timwoodchip is an intel employee and firm believer that the processor is the first place to start when selecting your next pc.
