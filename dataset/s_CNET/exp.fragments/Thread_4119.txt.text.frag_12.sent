you've introduced a newer high performance card into a system and haven't given any indication of your existing cooling setup...if you're using stock heatsinks and just have the power supply extracting air, then you can realistically expect other heavily used gaming components like the cpu and northbridge to be overheating...thermal throttling on the cpu (automatic speed cutback) can cause symptoms like what you have described. 
intel stock heatsinks can do ok or normal use, but they need to be pretty clean for gaming use...you might want to look at puting a more capable heatsink on that 3ghz room heater, might turn out to be quieter too.
