hi! so, i want to buy a wintv-pvr-250 mce so i can record me playing on my wii. the thing is i want to see the game at the same time on my tv(samsung ln-t3253h). 
can i plug my video card to my tv and my wii on the capture card so i can play my game normally? 
or is there a way i can play my game on my tv and record at the same time? 
os: windows xp video card: 7600 gs thank you!
