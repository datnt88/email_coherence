the other two usb i have is (imation) 4gb and another one i forgot its company with the size of 2gb. 
they do work on the pc. as for the new usb (32gb sandisk cruzers), it works only when i plug it in to the pc before starting it. 
but it works perfectly fine in my laptop. 
so the problem is definitely from the pc. i read what is in the link, my problem is slightly different, because my pc does read the usb, but i can't access it. 
i can only access it with the method mentioned above. 
i'll try your solution and i'll get back to inform you about the results. 
thanks for your help.
