amd phenom ii x4 925 asus m4a87td evo g.skill ddr3 1600 9-9-9-24 running: ddr3 1333 667mhz palit geforce gtx 460 1024mb gddr5 sonic coolmaster 212 plus hdd seagate 1.5 tb kingwin lz-1000 1000w psu i have run several different diagnostics tests. 
memtest 86 plus 4.whatever + great dos program to boot from usb flash drive, all pass: ran for 2 hours hot cpu tester pro: no errors ran for 2 hours and 40 minutes prime95: great diagnostics tool to leave running for a day to check system stability. 
no errors msi afterburner: to lower system default on gpu to 500mhz clock + manually increased fan to 100% changed all system to default in bios and disabled q-fan mode to boost cpu fan to 100% problems have vanished system is more stable. 
updated all drivers. 
found my problem came from overclocking. 
so i guess i will stay away from overclocking. 
i still have sound problems just not as frequent.
