i have a 2.6 ghz emachines from wally-shop. 
model # is w4682. 
i have finally upgraded the memory recently from it's wimpy 256mb by adding another 1gb. the 80gb hard disk is original. 
the only other mods have been adding a 128 mb agp card, and replacing the power supply 3 years ago. 
between my son and myself, we run the machine between 5 and 10 hours a day, 355 days a year.
