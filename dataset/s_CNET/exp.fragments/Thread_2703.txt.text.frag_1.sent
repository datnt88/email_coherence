hi- recently my amd duron 1200 cpu died, and im having trouble tracking down a replacement, my question is if anyone knows where to find one affordably, and second- does the k7s5a mobo with a atx case with 300 power supply support the amd duron 1400? 
any thoughts?? any help at all would be appreciated!
