how would you know if it's the cpu or the motherboard if that is the problem? 
sadly you need a good board to test the cpu on. 
power supplies are thankfully plentiful at the shop bench. 
-&gt; about the other items. 
be sure to check the cmos battery voltage too. 
on some boards if it's too low, the board never comes out of reset.
