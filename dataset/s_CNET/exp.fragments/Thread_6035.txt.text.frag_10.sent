the reason that your computer shuts off is because there is a problem with the cooling system which is located in the heat sink. 
to resolve this issue make sure tha the fan is working good and some computers uses special grease that helps to remove heat from the cpu.if it is dryed clean the cpu surface and apply greace then install the heat sink then the fan.
