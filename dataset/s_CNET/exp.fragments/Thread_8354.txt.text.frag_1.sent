my laptop connects to the internet via my wireless router using wifi. 
i have shared that connection via my ethernet port to an 8-port switch, which my desktop computer is plugged into. 
problem is, the internet stops working on the laptop as soon as the ethernet cable is plugged into the laptop. the internet starts working again as soon as the ethernet cable is unplugged or if the ethernet port is disabled. 
any ideas why this is happening? 
i've tried disabling the firewall on all devices but doesn't seem to make any difference. 
basically i want to distribute internet to the desktop using ics. 
i'm using xp and i've already tried following the instructions on the ms website.
