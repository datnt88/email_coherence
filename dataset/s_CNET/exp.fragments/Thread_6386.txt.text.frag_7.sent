taxiguy51, i have no idea what scanner hardware or software you are using. 
have you checked out your manual again? 
i really do not think it a problem with the usb cables. 
if i accidently, from acquire through photoshop, click on the wrong software for the scanner, i receive a screen error message, saying that the scanner cannot be found. 
check all cables to the scanner. 
that sounds like a problem with the software or choosing the wrong access to your scanner. 
do you accsess your scanner from the scanner or do you access it using software, or going through photoshop? 
setting up scanner software again is a pain. 
want to try it one more time?
