thanks, chris. 
i don't think it's under warranty, since it's 3+ years old. 
based on the configurations you sent, does each memory piece act as its own unit, or do two make up one? 
in other words, if i figure out that one is bad, does that mean its complimentary piece has to be replaced as well? the diagram you sent has the memory divided up into dmm1 and dmm2, with white and black clips. 
if one of the dmm1s, for example, is bad, do both have to be replaced? 
also, if they act independently, can i operate my computer with just three memory cards or do i need all four?
