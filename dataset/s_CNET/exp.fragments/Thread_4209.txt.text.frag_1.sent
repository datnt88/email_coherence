hello maybe i am asking for the impossible. 
but i would like to know any third party manufacturer that makes wireless network cards and corresponding drivers/software/hardwork hookup(if needed) for a mac g4 desktop system. 
optimally it would communicate with a linksys wrt54gs wireless router through a cable modem on a small internet network with two other &quot;os&quot; systems, (win xp and win98). 
mac manufacturer's seem to have an &quot;airport&quot; card or similar device and make it very unclear if there is any other hardware that can be used. 
this makes it very hard to know what i can use that will work in my situation. 
if anybody can help me out on this issue i would be greatly appreciated.
