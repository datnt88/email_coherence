antec (as bob said) pc power and cooling (considered best of the best) ocz enermax (most units) fortron source power (fsp group, and their hgher up stuff is fine) sparkle power (same stuff as fortron (their like the same company)) and some of thermaltake's units are fine, depending on what your using it for also 600w is rather huge i'd suggest 480w - 580w ensure the psu has at least 24a on the +12v rail or 2 12v rails at around 15a+ each (for example, antec's newpower is 12v1 20a, 12v2 18a, which is fine) or 3-4 12v rails, with 15a each or more
