not sure you question. 
you don't know how to write the access list itself or you don't understand where to apply it. 
although hp documentation is poor in this case there are examples and the syntax is the same as cisco. 
you already know what you want to allow and disallow so that is the hardest part. 
still you don't need to bother with stuff you want to deny only things you want to permit. 
everything is denied by default at the end.
