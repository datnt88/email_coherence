aight, here's the deal. the new mobo you're looking at didn't exactly get the best reviews on newegg, at least. 
i know, most of the posts people make are negative usually anyway, but it's just a thought. 
second, that mobo doesn't have integrated video, so you'll have to get a videocard, too. 
low-end geforce 7 series cards are near or under $100. 
if you're not looking at eventually going sli, drop down to an nforce 570 ultra board. 
it might be hard to find one that will support more than 2 ide devices, though. 
you will need more ram, even if it's not necessarily ddr2 800 speed. 
i went with ddr2 667, and it runs like a dream. 
definitely use a dual-core processor, it's the only way to go.
