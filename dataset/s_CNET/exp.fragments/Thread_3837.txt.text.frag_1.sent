i have a 500 gig seagate hard drive (sata) that is no longer working as an external (broken bus ). 
i'm considering using it as extra storage space. 
i have 2 ide drives that i'm using as master and slave. 
i run windows xp. my question is: can i use the sata as storage and keep the ide as my boot drive?
