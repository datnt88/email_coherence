i do hope my computer doesn't ever use more electricity than my central air unit. 
then i might consider shutting it off. 
i would bet it uses less than my oscillating fan though. 
besides that if computers needed to be shut off from time to time the whole damn country would just go dark because just about every thing is run by them anymore. 
far less money to replace a drive once in a great while than the power to run it. 
i mean this soley as another honest opinion and nothing more. the pharaoh
