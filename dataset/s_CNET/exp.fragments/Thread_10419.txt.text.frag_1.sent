currently have wireless broadband from a local isp. 
signal goes through outside antenna to alvarion breezeaccess box to wireless router. 
each pc has a wireless adapter. 
thinking of switching to verizon wireless. 
the verizon wireless modem would be usb. 
can i send the broadband signal from verizon's usb modem through a pc to the wireless router? 
running windows 2000.
