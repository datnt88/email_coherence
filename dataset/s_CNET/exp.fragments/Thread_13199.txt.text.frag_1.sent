i have charter internet and i have been losing internet connectivity so i decided to go with bellsouth dsl thinking it was charters problem. 
well when i was ordering bellsouth dsl online they have a tool to see if your computer meets the requirements. 
my computer passed everything except networking. 
i got this message (malfunctioning nic found.) what does this mean? is this why i am having internet trouble? 
it is a gateway computer running windows xp service pack 2. the computer is about 2 years old.
