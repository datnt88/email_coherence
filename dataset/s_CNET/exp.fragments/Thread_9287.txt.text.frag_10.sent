the battery on this on goes straight down, creating a ninety-degree angle. 
it's a little odd to hold, it can potentially be a handle. 
but i hesitate to pack it without taking the batter off. 
i'll look into an extra smaller battery, that way i can pack it away, and have a few extra hours in the bag.
