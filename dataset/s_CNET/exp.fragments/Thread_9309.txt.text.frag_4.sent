yes, the problem is the same in any program i try. 
both sets of home/end keys? 
do you mean repag/avpag? 
if so, they work ok. 
i could buy a different keyboard, but i don't think that's the problem. 
all other keys work perfectly, and these two ones have ceased to work at the same time. 
curious...
