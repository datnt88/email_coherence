i followed the previous advice (kind of) the pc would not boot from the floppy (it didn't seem to get power) or cd, so i put the hard drive into another computer. 
i reformatted the hard drive and then loaded windows xp on it. 
however, when i put the hard drive back into the compaq, the pc would still not boot up. 
i hear the machine go through the power up of the cd drives and the hard drive, but then nothing. the monitor stays dark. 
i used the monitor and keyboard with the other computer during the loading of xp so i know they work. 
i tried different connectors to the mother board. 
and i tried changing the power cables around. 
could it be the mother board? 
is this something i could fix myself or do i need to go to a repair shop? 
thanks, bruce
