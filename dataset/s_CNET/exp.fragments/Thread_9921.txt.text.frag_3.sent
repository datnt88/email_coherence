windows auto shut down at around 75 degrees. 
what heatsink do u have? 
i think it is not properly seated. 
and with those temperatures, the life of the cpu is gonna shorten and if u dont fix it probably gonna fry within a year. 
pentium 4s generally run around 50 degrees. 
how r u getting ur readings? 
could it be ur program is wrong?
