hi, just backed up my data and ran wd diagnostics in windows. 
in the quick test, just after a couple of seconds it showed a message &quot;too many bad sectors&quot;. 
also, the hdd smart status showed a question mark. 
i wasn't quite convinced with the result since my system has been working fine and many people have reported that the software can give wrong results if it is not able to get the smart status of the disk due to the inability of the onboard controller to return the smart status of the disk.. then i just downloaded the dos version of the program and installed it on a bootable floppy. 
restarted the system and booted from floppy and ran the dos version of wd diagnostics. 
to my surprise, the extended test showed that my hdd is fine and doesn't have any problems. 
can you suggest any other utility that i can use to check my hdd?
