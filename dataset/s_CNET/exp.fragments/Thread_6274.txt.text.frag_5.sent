this is a really old posting, but not a single person referred to the issue of the g5 dual problems. 
in a nutshell, do a search for &quot;g5 dual liquid-cooled leak&quot; or similar. 
you will learn that almost all of the g5 dual models produced suffered liquid-cooled leaks. 
this leak of a radiator-type fluid (toxic) would, in turn, fry the mother board. 
leading up to this would be inexplicable behavior including what seemed like software issues, locking up and, you guessed it, screaming fans. 
there are a total of 6 fans in these models, so when the motherboard was glitching and running them all, it does sound like a jet! 
anyone experiencing this issue (even now...2010) should contact apple support and immediately ask for a supervisor. 
this was a massive problem involving a multitude of macs; one which apple successfully &quot;handled&quot; on a case-by-case basis, thereby avoiding a massive recall.
