i have had a desktop pc for years and i always left it running in sleep mode when not in use. 
i recently got the new macbook and it is my first notebook. 
when i am not using it should i generally turn it off or leave it in sleep mode? 
im not to sure if there are any differences to the hardiness of laptop hdd's over desktops. 
reading online it seems that laptop hdd's seem to be a litte more fragile. 
also is there a problem with leaving the laptop plugged into the wall for extended periods even after it is done charging?
