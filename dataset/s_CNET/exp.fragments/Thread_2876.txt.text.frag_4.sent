jumpers, those are small plug thingees that need to set. 
this tells the system either master/slave -or- cs setting for use on the cable. 
once, you remove the old cd, review the decal/sticker and see what its set as. you can use that to help set the new drive. 
for most, you probably have an eide type cd drive, thus a new eide is required, also known as a pata vs sata type. 
as for a brand pick one, if you've a hp system, then keep it in the family or not, pick one of the others. 
it really doesn't matter in the long run.
