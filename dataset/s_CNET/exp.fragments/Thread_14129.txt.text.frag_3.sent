notwithstanding the information from bob, the mac mini will drive almost any crt or lcd monitor. 
you are not limited to buying an apple branded one. the machine should have a dvi connection as well as a vga connection. 
get your speakers separately, they usually sound better than the ones inside monitors. 
one thing you might want to do, add more memory immediately. 
good luck p
