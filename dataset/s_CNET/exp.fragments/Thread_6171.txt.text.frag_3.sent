i agree with robert, bundled s/w isn't a given to work on other drives, but you can try. 
now, maybe a good time to try a &quot;retail&quot; versions and understand they offer alot more than when you got your older s/w. the most notable are roxio and nero. 
i lean towards nero, but you can check your cd/rw burner support website they may provide an oem for your use. 
if you like a very cheap retail version(older), try this website: and look for cd creator v3.x, i believe under s/w area. 
good luck -----willy
