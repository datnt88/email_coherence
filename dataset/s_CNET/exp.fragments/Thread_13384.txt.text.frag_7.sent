but my background involves dvr for security systems. 
we push video over wireless and have programmers and more to get it working. 
i can't know if you are simply a consumer or someone that dives in and writes code and builds hardware. 
that's why i can't give you any good news. it seems you want to buy something and play with it rather than build it, program it and such. 
sorry if this offends you in any way.
