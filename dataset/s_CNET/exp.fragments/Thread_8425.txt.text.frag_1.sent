i bought a k7s5a as new from a retailer back in september of 2005. 
called up ecs and they said they will not warranty the board because it's a discontinued board. 
unfortunately for me, the company i bought it from has gone out of business. 
so, what am i supposed to do? 
i called ecs, but they don't want to stand behind their products. 
anyone else have this kind of issue? 
i hope not! 
thanks tim shanks
