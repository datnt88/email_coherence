to give you some context to this poll, read this blog: will ipad become generic for 'tablet?' do you see a day when ipad becomes generic for &quot;tablet?&quot; -- yes, it already is. 
(how so?) -- soon. 
this new naming strategy will push the adoption of the term. 
(can you expand on this?) -- never. 
tablets are too different from each other. 
(how so?) -- maybe. it depends on what other tablet makers do. 
(like what?) -- other. 
(please explain.)
