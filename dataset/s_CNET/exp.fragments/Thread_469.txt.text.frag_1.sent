help, i want to send a message from my laptop running win xp to another computer also running xp. in ms-dos prompt, i type &quot;net send family hi&quot; (family is the name of the other computer) but it says the alias could not be found although that is the name i gave the other computer. 
the laptop is wireless and the other computer isn't. 
i tried turning off the windows firewall but it didn't help. 
any help would be greatly appreciated, trent
