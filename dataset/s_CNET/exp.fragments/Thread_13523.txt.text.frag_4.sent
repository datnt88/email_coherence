but i assumed all that work you mentioned had taken several days, including at least one shutdown each night and reboot each morning. 
so either all that work was done in just one day, or you're one of that people that leave their machine on continually. 
that's not what windows is made for. 
anyway, don't forget the lesson about backup of data on an external. 
if you read through this forum, you'll see many posts about problems with external drives resulting in data loss.
