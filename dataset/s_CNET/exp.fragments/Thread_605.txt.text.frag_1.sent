hello, i am planning a new itx-build computer and i'm a bit unsure as to a video card. 
ideally, i would like to find a card that could sound as well as video through the hdmi port. 
would most video cards with an hdmi port be capable of sound output, or would i need to look for a special feature on the card? 
(also, i have no real plans on gaming on it. the most graphically demanding operation is probably just playing blu-ray on it. 
if i can find a slim blu-ray drive.) here is the case and motherboard i am planning on purchasing in case this has any affect on a recommendation. 
thanks!
