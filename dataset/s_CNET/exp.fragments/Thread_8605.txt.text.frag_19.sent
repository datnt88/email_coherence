if the router maker can't help, and all the ideas here fail, it's time to get your money back for another router. 
i've worked too many routers over the years and even was on a team that created one of the early routers. 
i'm at a disadvantage that i can't see your site or swap out the router for a test. 
that's what we do when it's a stumper like this. but as you can guess, such a site call costs far more than a router and why most folk opt to try other routers.
