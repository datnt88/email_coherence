since i don't research devices, the question would be, does the modem incorporate a router? 
and does this router contain a wireless radio? 
if the answer is no to the router, you need to purchase a wireless router to attach to the modem. 
connect thus: modem -&gt; router -&gt; pc. please answer the first two questions.
