sorry if there's been a discussion about this already, if there was i'd appreciate a link to it. 
i just want to know what kind of power supply would be needed to support a system with something like: intel i7 920, ati radeon hd 5850 graphics. 
it seems to me like those are the major players in deciding a power supply. 
thanks.
