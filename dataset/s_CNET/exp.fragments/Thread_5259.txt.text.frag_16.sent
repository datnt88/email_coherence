this was a strange problem and after months of troubleshooting i finally found it. 
i tried replacing and swapping out everything. the answer is...the monitor. 
hard to believe, but the monitor ( viewsonic vx2245 ) had a bad power supply that was not only causing problems with the pc power supply but the monitor ( thru the dvi plug ) took forever to send a 'ready' signal to the video card. 
once the monitor finally powered up everything worked fine. the root cause of the power supply problem in the monitor was ....bad capacitors. 
so the guy that responded to this thread stating bad caps as the source of the problem wins the prize !!! good call. 
i replaced the monitor with the same model ( vx2245 ) and my system has been super stable for 2 weeks. 
boots right up everytime.
