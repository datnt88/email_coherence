i don't think turning a harddrive off and on each day does have any negative influence on it's lifetime. 
in fact, it can be argued it has a positive influence. 
mean time between failures is measured in hours of operation, without any mention of stops during that period. 
there are hard drives in camcorders and mp3-players that only run when needed (to conserve battery live). 
windows has energy-saving options that turn off the hard drive after a certain period of inactivity. 
they wouldn't do that if it's harmful. 
the main effect of leaving a computer on 24/7 is a higher electricity bill. the price of the power consumed during the night in the lifetime of a pc is comparable to the price of a new hard disk.
