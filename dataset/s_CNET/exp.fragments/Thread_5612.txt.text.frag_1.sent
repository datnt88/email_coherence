my computer reported an error in writing to the c: drive (i have my drive partitioned) while working/surfing/ (on known sites) on it. 
i did a restart of the computer, and came up with a black screen, nothing else. 
i put in another backup drive and got the computer running. 
the main c: drive is blank, empty 0 free space, 0 space. 
it needs to be formated? 
huh? 
what happened? 
i have tried to use several free hardrive recovery programs with no luck(not seeing anything)? 
what is going on here? 
how can i recover from this? thanks in advance...
