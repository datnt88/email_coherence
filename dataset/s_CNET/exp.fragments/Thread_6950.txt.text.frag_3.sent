thanks for a detailed reply. 
i havn't done it yet as i need to move phone lines first, then i can hard wire the router to the desktop. 
but i have another issue with the wireless connection. 
i connect at 54mbps but it can disappear down to 1mbps. 
it is currently at 36. is someone hijacking my router? 
how can i tell if that is happening? 
thanks guys.
