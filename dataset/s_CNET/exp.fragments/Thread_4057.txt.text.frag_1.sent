i have 2 win xp comps, just want to connect them together just to move files. 
have the crossover cable. the desktop will not register a domain or workgroup. 
network setup goes to completion but i can't make or join any workgroups. 
on the network id section, it says:&quot;you must install networking before you can change this computer's domain membership&quot;. 
the member section is greyed out on the desktop but it's fully accessible on the laptop (the other comp). 
i have done the static ip addy and network set up disks in both directions with and with out firewall. 
nothing works. 
does anyone have good instructions on how to do this? 
it's supposed to be easy but the desktop refuses to work. 
i have 2 network cards on the desktop that are fully updated: sis900 and realtek rtl8139. 
i have disabled, disconnected 1 or the other. the networking just won't work. 
i've lost sleep for the past week on this problem. 
help thanks
