the site i linked to is out of akron, ohio btw and i've done business with them personally as well as as an adviser (of a sort) to the school where my wife works. 
they've been very good and often have lower prices than others including newegg but do charge tax and shipping. 
i don't mind and i do anti up for out of state purchases when i do my ohio taxes. 
in any event, i don't see here that there's anything to say that i must have some sort of government id and, of course, there are thousands and thousands of government type purchasing offices. 
there are sites such as cdwg that cater to government and school systems and i've needed to help work with these as well. 
there are some products specifically tailored for educational use and can be offered at discounted prices to volume buyers. the watermark idea is interesting. 
i know i've tried to scan some documents that, although you could not see anything unusual in the original, scanning these would pull out the watermark and disclose that it was a photocopy.
