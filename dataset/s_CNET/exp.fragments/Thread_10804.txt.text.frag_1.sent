alright, so i got my computer custom made, and the day after i order it, i read something about how power supplies are the #1 most overlooked part of a custom comp. 
i got the intel i7 and a 400w power supply, should that be enough, because now that i have the computer, it worked fine for the first week, and now in the past 12 hours of use, it has turned off instantly 3 times now, the first two times i was running many things and thought it might have been a little too much for the power supply, but the most recent time, it turned off right when i started it up after going to google... thanks in advance for the help...
