hey guys.. i have an acer al1916fbd , and i was wondering how i would go about connecting a videogame console with component outputs to my lcd. the recommended resolution on my monitor is 1280x1024. 
i have heard that i should get a vga box, scan converter, transcoder... i dunno , i believe these are different names for the same type of product. 
can anyone help me?? thanks!!
