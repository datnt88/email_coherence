thanks a lot for your early reply. 
today i phoned lexmark technical service and was told that the problem is sharing between 2 different os. it looked like a quick answer; the guy wasn't interested in digging any further. 
on my part, i do think that sharing between different computers (and consequently different os) is of the essence of networking, and optimistically guess there should be a way.
