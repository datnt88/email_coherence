what do you think of the first two on &lt;a href=&quot; &gt;this newegg site&lt;/a&gt; - the cavalry caxm37500 and the western digital es wdg1su5000n, both 500gb with usb/esata interface? 
or is there something else i should look at? (btw, the wd drive is pushing my price limit a bit, but if it's otherwise a really good drive i may be willing to consider it.) of course i'll need to get a usb 2.0 / firewire / sata interface card for our computer. 
(and, i still have that dang 127gib 28bit lba to deal with...)
