two hard drives and ghost 2003 . 
. . 
a. 2 partitions c: os and all apps d: all data b. 2 partitions e: small partition for swapfile f: images of c: and d: if the os gets corrupt ... get the image of c: from f: and restore it with ghost. 
if drive primary drive dies....replace it and restore c: and d: from the images on f: with ghost. 
if you get a windfall...then put the images of c: and d: on an external...just in case. 
trust me, it works and works well.
