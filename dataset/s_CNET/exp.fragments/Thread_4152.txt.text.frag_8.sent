there's a good chance the computer comes with a restore partition and a utility to make your own restore dvd from that. 
it's cheaper for the manufacturer doing it like this then providing the dvd. 
and it's easier to boot from the restore partition (as long as the hard disk isn't replaced) than from that dvd. but of course you make that dvd just in case the disk fails.
