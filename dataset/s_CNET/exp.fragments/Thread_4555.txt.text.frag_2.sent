does that mean you are wanting folk to write something specific for you? 
sorry if i misunderstood your question but multi-touch support is in the new visual studio 2010 and apps you write (hence custom) there. 
you may have to get such things created since your off the shelf apps are going to be wimp (windows icon mouse pointer) based for a reason.
