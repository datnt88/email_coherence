i can't bring the computer to a hot spot since it is a tower machine and not a laptop.i 
don't know where any hot spots are, anyway. 
i am not that advanced in networking yet. 
and mrmacfixit you were right about the antenna. the plug got knocked out when i shut the machine up after installing the card! 
but, after replugging the antenna it still is not recognizing any networks. 
here is what i did yesterday. 
i brought my laptop to where the mac is and it said the signal was very weak. 
it would not connect. 
so besides a possible airport card issue, i do have interference due to distance. 
airport card - the instructions i got from apple tech web site said to install the card serial number side up. 
i did that and it seems like the antenna should plug into the hole on the left side when the card is installed. 
there is also a hole on the right side but it is smaller and the antenna plug would not fit. 
so, did i pick the right spot to put the antenna? 
next thing i will do is reseat the airport card tomorrow or saturday and test again. 
then, monday i will move my dsl modem and the router to the phone jack closer to where the mac is and see if it picks up a signal then. 
i can't do this until monday since i am on call for work and can't disrupt my working network in case i am called for an issue. 
thank you for all of your suggestions. 
i am determined to get this network working!
