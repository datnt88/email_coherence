let me first tell u that im not a very techie person. 
i know this that on my board (d865gbf) i hv a built-in vga, so how can i try another one? the fan looks fine to me, its working....and a temp sensor in the casing shows temps around 35-42 deg celcius u think its not ram? and i cant do much testing on the pc since it freezed almost a minute or two after starting
