hi, there, lisa here, reporting that our gateway gm5478 is still performing flawlessly since we did the &quot;manual restart prior to hourly auto shutdown,&quot; on january 15th. 
i just cannot believe that such a simple fix could remedy months and months of frustration and improper diagnosis (&quot;there's nothing wrong with your computer...&quot;) by the geek squad. 
anyhow, will report if the good luck ends and the problem resurfaces. 
anyone out there know why a manual restart prior to auto shutdown would fix this problem?? thanks...
