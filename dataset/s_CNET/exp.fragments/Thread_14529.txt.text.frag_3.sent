first issue is if the proxy runs in transparent mode or not. 
if your browser settings are set to no proxy but you know you run via a proxy then it is transparent and as the name implies you will not be able to easily detect it. 
assuming it is not transparent about all you can do as a user is see if you can ping the proxy itself. 
if it pings then you know it is not your machine or your connection to the proxy. 
when it comes to internet in a large corporate environment most installations are impossible to troubleshoot from the user side. 
since most large companies have multiple internet connections the first challenge is to even find the ip of the proxy. 
this is done via the proxy pac setting in the browser. 
so after you get the proxy from that you now have a ip but that does not really mean it is the proxy. 
normally you place a load balancer on that ip and place multiple proxy behind it for performance and redundancy. 
then you come into the issue that some traffic will not even run though a proxy so there are multiple devices depending on the protocol. 
so ping may work and it means nothing. 
you could be pinging a load balancer or your ping traffic could go via a firewall and the web traffic go via a proxy. 
of course the easiest way to see if it is your machine or the network is to ask you co workers if they too have a issue.
