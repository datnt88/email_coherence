yes i posted this question about 2 weeks ago, but didn't seem to get any response to it. 
my problem is with my linksys usb adapter. 
my linksys router (wrt54g v3.1) is upstairs, and my linksys usb adapter is also upstairs (down the hall). the connection is not the problem, cause on the desktop with the usb adapter i get about 36.0mbps nicely. the problem is, i can't get on the internet. 
it says connected to router but connection to the internet it can't get too. 
this is real strange to me, cause usually i can get to the internet with no problems if im connected to the router, then internet usually is connected. 
not with this though. 
im not sure what the problem is. 
any advice?
