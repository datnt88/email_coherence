purchased an unused (new) soundcard as above (without front box). 
it uses an emu10k1-ngf chip, and has the 38 pin external connector, cd_spdif, aux_in, cd_in, tad, and the 5 mini-jack sockets. 
i am trying to install the liveware 3.0 software but all i get is an error message &quot;not enough disk space&quot;. 
as i have 20gb free space i cannot understand this. 
i have managed to install drivers (sblivewin9xdrv.zip containing 18/04/00 as the latest file)) so i have sound/midi. 
also the speaker set-up seems to have been installed, and an icon in my startup folder for the 'user's guide' although this does not link to any file. 
creative tell me this is an oem card and cannot help me - contact the manufacturer. 
now who is the manufacturer?? i also suspect it is a 'value' card from google searches. 
am i pursuing a dead dog in trying to install this? it is a 38mb download which on dial-up is no joke! 
w98se, 384mb ram, epoxy via mobo, amd xp2000+ cpu.
