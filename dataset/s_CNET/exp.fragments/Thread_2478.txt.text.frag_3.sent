copy it at the store and see if the store model does ok or not. 
remember that color copiers do not make color accurate copies. 
i will not embark on the lessons about color copiers, color calibration (look up pantone spyders), paper and even why this is so. 
but expectations of a color accurate copy are usually dashed.
