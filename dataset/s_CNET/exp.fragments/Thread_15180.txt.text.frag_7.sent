well, i wish i had a different drive. 
i ghosted my old drive to the emachines installed drive (seagate 160mb) and now i get a hal.dll missing error when the pc boots up. 
i tried just copying the new hal.dll overwriting the hal.dll but no luck. 
should of expected this. 
i don't want to do a new install of windows because i don't have the disks and don't have cd's for most of my apps. 
i tried editing the boot.ini 
file but no luck there either. 
any suggestions?
