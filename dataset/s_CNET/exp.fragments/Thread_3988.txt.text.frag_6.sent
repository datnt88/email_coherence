na, there is no lag whatsoever. 
i just started learning how to build a computer and later on i'm hoping to spend around 3 grand to build one, but i researched around and the highest gaming machine will cost around 6-7 grand, which is why i think the xps 710 h2c is a good deal since they overclock it and what not.
