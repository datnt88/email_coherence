i also have had the same thing happen to me except with cd-r disks(tho i was'nt using rw disks then),and with different makes of cd-r roms,some would work others would come back with errors like yours when i first got my comp around a year ago,i don't seem to get that prob much anymore so i assume the auto update function of the comp has addressed that issue or i've fluked it...lol...anyway veritas is the company who make it,try and see if any updates are available(there may be a knowledge base there that can give pointers to your specific problem) and try diff makes of disks and good quality ones (i used tdk and piranha),failing that as already suggested change to a diff software,i tend to use nero 6 a lot more now (it came with a dvd burner i bought)it's a premo software tho i did find it a bit confusing to use at first
