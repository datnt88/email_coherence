hi all, i just moved house and re-setup my computer (a dell xps t600r piii, 512mb ram, 50gb hd, 19in dell trinitron, nvidia tnt2 64mb video card.) it works fine except for one annoying new problem: the screen now flickers and jumps 75% of the time. 
periodically it will stop for maybe a minute and then it resumes hopping. 
i never had this problem prior to moving. 
what might be causing this?
