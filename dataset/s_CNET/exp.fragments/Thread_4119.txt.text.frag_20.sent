i recently had an nvidia card go south on my machine. 
symptoms were much as you describe - video was choppy and the entire machine seemed to slow down, including slow keyboard and mouse. the video card itself was getting very hot, especially when trying to run graphics programs, to the point of occasionally shutting the machine down. 
colors were rendering badly, and i would sometimes get a set of yellow vertical stripes on my monitor. 
when a video card starts getting errors, any program has to retry and retry the commands. 
this soaks up main cpu cycles, so everything slows down. 
first, try removing and re-seating the card. 
it might just be a loose connection. 
if that doesn't help, you'll probably have to replace the card. 
i hope it's still under warranty!
