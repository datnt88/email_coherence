i have a linksys b router on my main pc and a wireless pci card for my old pc which was win98, mine is xp, now i have another xp and tried to use same for this one but nothing, i got a wireless g pci card. 
i wonder if i can use with b router, i called linksys about the b to b connection but no help, they tried saying something missing from software, i think. 
i t just won't make the connection, i am connected with the wired from room to room but that looks sloppy, with a cord going across the house, is there something i can do to get connected wireless, thanks in advance
