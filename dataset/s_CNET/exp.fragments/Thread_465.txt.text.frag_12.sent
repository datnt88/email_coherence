i am not ashamed to say i have three six year old desktops with windows xp as os. after tweaking similarly aged pcs owned by friends & neighbors, i learned that it is a matter of optimizing one's pc that he gets the best out of it. 
even six-year old pcs can come to life like new if the proper tweaks, software & hardware, are made. 
a friend of mine had a windows vista but because he knew little found himself complaining his pc is slow. 
when i did the usual tweaking i do, i found out he could not achieve the speeds that his pc had because he did not take good care of it. 
some of the software i have tried that worked includes atf cleaner, ccleaner, ncleaner and tune up utilities.
