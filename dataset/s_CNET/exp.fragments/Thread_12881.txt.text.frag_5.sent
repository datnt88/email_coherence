my motherboard won't recognize the amd xp2900 processor. 
i have tried to reset the bios to the recommended 200 mhz x 10x multiplier. 
when the system tries to reboot it just hangs. 
i have to shut down and clear the cmos just to get it to the bios screen to start again. 
suggestions? the manual says this processor should work with this motherboard.
