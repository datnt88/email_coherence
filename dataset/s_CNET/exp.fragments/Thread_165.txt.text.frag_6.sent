since we don't know whether your laptop could handle the extra heat and power requirements of the 7200 rpm drive, and you get twice the storage capacity with this one, i'd say this is a pretty easy choice. 
you certainly can stay with xp, but you will no longer get security updates from ms, and newer software may not support it. 
newer devices like the sata ones and software like ie9 will become increasingly unavailable, and it will become increasingly difficult to protect yourself from viruses and malware. 
ide hard drives are already starting to get scarce. 
but as long as it works for you and you're happy with it, it's your computer and you can certainly do what you want with it. 
good luck.
