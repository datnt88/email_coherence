i've tried the degaussing already. 
it didn't work. 
i've tried adjusting the convergence, trapezoid, paralelogram and so on... several times. 
my girlfriend has samsung syncmaster 997mb. 
it too has a ergoflat tech crt. 
i noticed it has the same distortion. 
i guess that (distortion) is something any monitor with this tech has. 
i'll try contacting philips on this issue as well. 
thank you, dejan
