by the way....as soon as you get the ram, unplug the pc, check the mfg instructions re installing ram, remove all old ram and install new ram. 
then download and run memtest86+ to test the ram say overnight. 
assuming no errors...button up the pc and enjoy ! 
good experience for a father and son. 
and last...shoot us a note on how it went.
