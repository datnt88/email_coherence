i have an anthlon xp 1900+ cpu. 
in my bios, there are three setting. 
cpu frequency 100mhz/ram 100mhz, cpu frequency 100/ram 133mhz, and cpu frequency 133mhz/ram 133mhz. 
which is correct for this cpu? it seems the bios only displays the correct name for the cpu with the 133/133 setting. 
all else and it says 1200mhz cpu, which i know is wrong. 
still, i'd like to know.
