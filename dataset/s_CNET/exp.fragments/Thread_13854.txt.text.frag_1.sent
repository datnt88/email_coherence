yah i got 2 computers one is xp and one is windows vista. 
when i try to connect to the internet on my xp computer it says limited or no connection but it says on my modom that it is connected. 
i tried diffrent cables and it still says it. does anyone know what might the problem is? 
thanks p.s. it started when the internet went down of the heat then when it came back up it i got the limited or no connection. the vista computer has no problems.
