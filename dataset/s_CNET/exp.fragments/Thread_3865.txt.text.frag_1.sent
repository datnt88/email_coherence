i recently (about 3 or 4 weeks ago) purchased a lexmark x4975 all-in-one wireless printer and installed it without too much difficulty. 
however, since i set it up, something occurred that has caused it not to work, either wirelessly or via usb. 
when hooked up via usb, i get the usual recognition of the printer, everything looks fine, it shows up in the printer list, but when i try to print, it claims that it isn't communicating. 
when trying to print wirelessly, the printer progress window pops up, shows 5 or 10% progress then it stalls. 
i have a feeling that it may be the installation of service pack 3. (i have a compaq v6000 laptop running xp pro). 
in my household, there are two other laptops that can print wirelessly just fine. 
they both have xp home ( i am unsure whether they have sp3 yet) lexmark tech support is stumped at the moment. 
i can't recall exactly when i upgraded to sp3. is there a log by which i can find out when that was installed on my computer? 
beyond that, does anybody have any other theories? 
thanks
