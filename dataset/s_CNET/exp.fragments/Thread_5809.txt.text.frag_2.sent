first a little background. 
i've worked for a company that designed, sold and repaired those school bus cameras. 
they did have a camcorder (sony too!) and we had to use a camcorder modified by sony for a small issue. the camcorder auto shuts off after some number of minutes. 
this is why your project should not involve this camcorder. 
those wifi cams you see might work if your wifi access point is someplace closer.
