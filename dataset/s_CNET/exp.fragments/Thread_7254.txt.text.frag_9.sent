no recall. 
no lie most of my memory was wiped out literally when i had a heart attack 2 years ago. 
if you have ever seen the drew barry moore movie my fifty first dates where she wakes up each morning and thinks it's the same day, that's basically me. 
i barely remember what i need to do each day without having post it notes all over the house. 
another reason why i now have the drive. 
it was given to me by a relative because of what i noted above. 
will give your multiple thing a shot. 
if not, i appreciate you spending the time answering this.
