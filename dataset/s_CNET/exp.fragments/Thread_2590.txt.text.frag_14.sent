when i read &quot;and i have it set to the spd settings in bios&quot; i thought you were entering in the timing. 
yes, it sounds a notch too low according to what i read. 
try this. 
head to the bios and enter the slowest settings for the ram possible. 
i don't hold much hope for that but all the above points to some odd bios+cpu issue. 
xp does fine on quad core machines here and has for years. 
while i've lost count of how many i installed, the hp d4999t and d5000 we have at home ran xp without such loopiness. 
now they run 7 64 bit.
