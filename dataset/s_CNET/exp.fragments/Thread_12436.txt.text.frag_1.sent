i have had my computer for a while now and it keeps having the same problem. 
every time i turn on my pc the monitor only has about a 33% chance of &quot;starting up&quot; and showing the computer graphics. 
the rest of the time the monitor turns on, but doesn't show anything (it's just black). 
i have checked all of my connections and use the latest video drivers, but i still seem to keep having this problem, which is really annoying since i have to reboot 2-3 times every time i try to turn on my computer just to get the monitor to work. 
i think it may have something to do with the fact that i have an integrated video card (i installed a agp video card the first time i used it) and that this is confusing the monitor. 
any ideas on what may be happening? 
here are my system specks: pentium iv 2.4 ghz 512 mb ram video: gexcube radeon 9600 xt 256 mb video motherboard: asus asrock ge pro-m2 windows xp sp 2 i use a 15&quot; monitor that worked on my previous pc. 
thanks for your help.
