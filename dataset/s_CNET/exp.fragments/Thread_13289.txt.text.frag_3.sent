well, assuming you only want one partition, and you should, it's easy. 
first boot into bios setup and make your cd rom the first boot device put your xp disk in the cdrom, save and exit bios the winxp disk will take you thru it set one big partition on c: then make it active then you have to format. 
when asked how you want to format, i advise just choosing defaults, like ntfs not fat 32 after that winxp does the whole setup/install by itself, at least it did for me ---&gt;you can also partition using a win 98 startup disk with fdisk see or type &quot;how to partition a hard disk&quot; in google -- lots of tutorials out there it's all very easy, altho the formatting takes a while. 
be sure to go back into bios and reset your 1st boot device to be your drive if bob tells you different, do what he says!
