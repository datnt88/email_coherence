unless you have any x.3.x installation disks, and can boot from them, then you are generally sol. the major question here is not that you cannot change your password, but that you cannot boot from the cd. will it boot from any cd? will it read any cd's? 
how were you planning on installing os x fresh without any installation disks? 
go beg, borrow or otherwise obtain, a set of panther installation disks. 
if you are trying to boot from the restore disks from another mac, you are probably wasting your time. 
they are machine specific.
