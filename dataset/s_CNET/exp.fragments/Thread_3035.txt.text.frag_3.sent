i did look through the others, but i couldn't find one that applied to my situation. 
haven't been able to find anything in my documentation either. 
i bought this computer knowing that the 6150se is not intended for high-end gaming. 
that's fine, because i don't play many games and when i do, they are usually not the graphic-intensive variety. 
it's just that occasionally i like to fire up a flight sim and am wondering if i can get a little bit better performance out of this computer. 
i assume that means a graphics card, but if there are other ways to do it, i'm all ears.
