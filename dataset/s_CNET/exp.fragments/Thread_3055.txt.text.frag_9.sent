my pc has the amd athlon xp 2500+ cpu which is 1.82 ghz. 
i have more than 70 icons on my screen which means i have lots of software. 
therefore, having more ram means more strength. 
i usually have four or five programs running and therefore i have 1 gb ram. the intel had a new 775 cpu which mated to the new 915 motherboard and pci display card. 
these days, minimum ram will be 512 as they are the muscle. 
try to imagine a 2.8ghz with 256 ram. the pc will be down all the time. 
people are willing to go for ram, cpu, display card then motherboard. 
i learned from one pc magazine that the former and the new ceo of dell have in their pc. cpu-3.0ghz 
ram- 2 gb harddrive- 160 gb display card- ati radeon 9800 pro dvd-rom- 8xdvd+ so speed is not the main issue as there are many servers are still running 2.4ghz. 
go for the ram!
