i have to agree with carl. 
since i've lost a usb stick with some personal stuff, i decided not to use this type of tiny device without encryption ever again. 
easylock is the easiest tool i found. 
i'm telling you...you just have to drag and drop the files in the encrypted side, and it's all done.
