the nist (national institute of standards and technology) and other organizations have done several studies on this question. 
if you search the cnet forums, there are several threads about this issue. 
bottom line is use the best media you can afford and keep it dry, temperate and dust free. 
some concerns are whether software will be able to read these &quot;ancient&quot; files in 50 to 100 years. 
that was discussed when 5 1/4 inch diskettes were the norm (won't mention the old 8 inch ones). 
below is one site, i have not researched the nist papers for awhile.
