i have a nforce 570 slit-a motherboard. 
i have a single hard drive (250gb) that i have plugged into the sata1 connector. 
i have 2 ide channels (one primary and one secondary). 
i currently have my dvd rw drive plugged into the secondard ide channel. is that correct? 
i was reading on a post that i need to buy an ide card for the dvd but i don't see the sense in that if i have 2 ide's available. 
thank you for your thoughts.
