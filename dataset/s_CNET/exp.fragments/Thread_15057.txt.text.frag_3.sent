the only time i would go the vendor route is if their components are at least equivelant to the components i would use. 
you won't find the parts cheaper than the vendor option because they buy in quantity. 
plus, you have their warranty rather than having to mess with several parts vendor warranties. 
personally, i have yet to find a vendor-built system that i would have built myself..but then, that's just me . 
good luck. 
and enjoy the process. 
and life goes on... jack
