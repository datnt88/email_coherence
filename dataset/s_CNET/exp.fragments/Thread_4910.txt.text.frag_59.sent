sorry guys i havent checked this thread for awhile. 
i did eventually start getting the reboots again. 
i ended up just updating to the new bios that intel has released for the g33 chipset. 
be careful and since this bios is not from gateway it does or will have it issues. 
but it does stop the reboots at least until gateway releases there own version of the new bios.i 
do get and error now during startup that says cannot find the aa number which because gateway uses there own.which the bios from gateway will fix that.it 
just means hitting enter once before it will get to desktop. 
good luck and try at own risk. 
as for the dual boot issue. 
lol had the same issue with stop errors after xp install would be done copying files. the only way to get past this point is to. 
have a xp disk with sp2 integrated and and you must slipstream the drivers for your sata & raid controllers on to the disk as well. 
follow the directions at this link to create your own slipstream disk. 
it is easiest to just add driver packs to the disk. 
i would recommend adding the chipset and mass storage at least. the more driver packs you add the more hardware drivers that the xp disk will have built in already for installation during setup. 
i know it seems like alot but it`s worth it. 
also while your using nlite you can also do a unattended install as well. 
basically add all your options that you would normally have to do during install. 
customize that disk to your very own needs. 
even add your cd key for automatically inputing when required. 
i would recommend installing xp first then add vista second. 
good luck
