i see a hard disk, no write protection and no second copy. 
it's sad to see such touted as backup when such are nothing but a fine &quot;copy.&quot; for proof we need do nothing more than read this (and other) forum for pleas about how to get said drive working again after some accident. 
acronis is nice since you can backup to recordable media which you carry away from the computer.
