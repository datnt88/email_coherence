michael, no other changes have been made to the network (which is really only two pcs and the router) that i can think of that would have caused this problem. 
i did install xp service pack 2 on one of the machines, but not the other, but both are having the problem, and had been since before the sp2 install. 
manually turning the sp2 firewall off on the one box does not improve things.
