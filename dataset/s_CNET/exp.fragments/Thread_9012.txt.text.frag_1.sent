i have host pc xp and laptop ibm t22 xp. i successfully made a wirless network that was up and running fine until two days ago. 
i havent had it long. 
i then decided to fix up some security in the router - a dlink g604t. 
fine! 
went to log on my laptop and found crosses on my voyager usb adapter...no network connection present and media is disconnected in ipconfig. 
i seem to have tried everyhting. 
even starting from scratch by setting router back to default and starting all over again. 
all to no avail. 
my laptop will simply not recognise that the adapter is plugged in and the lights are on! 
all lights on router fine and pc running well but i've definately drawn a blank on the laptop. 
tried system restore to see if i corrupted something during config of laptop after security set up. 
uninstalled reinstalled adapter. 
this is aol too but it was working firne for a few days. 
can anyone shed any light on this please in good old simple jargon as i am a bit of a novice! 
thanks threepence
