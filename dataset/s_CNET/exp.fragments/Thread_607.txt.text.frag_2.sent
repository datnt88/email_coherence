is yours an internal or external? 
your mention of a db25 connector sounds like the external type that plugged into the printer port and had a pass through to the printer. 
if that's the case, it would still plug into a printer port if your mb has one. the first internals, if i recall correctly, came with a scsi card and cable. 
later ones were atapi. 
which do you have?
