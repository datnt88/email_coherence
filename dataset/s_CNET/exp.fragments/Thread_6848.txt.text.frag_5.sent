for a last chance shot, i put back a pci nic that is finicky and has troubles connecting, anyways, i made a cross-over cable and used that to connect to the network and it appears to be working, but most home routers are auto sensing, including the ones i was working with, but not working. 
don't know what is different about this, the only thing i can think of is that the current motherboard has a built in cable tester when plugged into the onboard nic that said the 1-2 pair was okay, 3-4 & 5-6 pairs were open at 0.0-0.4 meters and pair 7-8 failed at 10-11 meters and when using crossover, data travels the same pairs each direction proof of this would be one of the times i got lucky and it connected once, i could get connected to network, but wouldn't connect to a webpage. 
anyways, before you think the cable is bad, i have tried known good cables with the same problem.
