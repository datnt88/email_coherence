hey all- i was wondering what i need for these situations: - my laptop on the go - what tech do i need to have a reliable internet connection most of the time ($100-250 dollar range). 
-could i replace my cable with a router or something? 
i have 2 desktop and 3 laptops. 
but i heard routers are unreliable; would making the switch be the right and cheap choice?
