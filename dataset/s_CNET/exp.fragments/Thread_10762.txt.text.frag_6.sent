since you state the enclosure that this hd was installed in was damaged, then it suggest the hd could be damaged as well. 
not knowing what damage, you maybe seeing the result, causing other working pc to not be proper with it installed. 
you know its doing something negative here. 
i use ad-2020 adapter setup(or others) in order to test various drives w/o an enclose and if it doesn't work, then i know any further attempts usually aren't going to be fruitful. 
it appears your old hd is a goner or close to it provided everything is setup correctly. 
checkout: what happens when that hd is installed alone, then use the ubuntu bootable linux disc to then access it? 
get the ubuntu s/w .iso 
file to make a bootable disc to test with. 
this allows the cd drive to boot the current pc and then access the now &quot;solo trouble hd&quot; if at all possible. 
if it does't boot or finding the hd didn't mount, suggest serious issues.
