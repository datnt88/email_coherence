after destroying my epson c80 with generic ink from a large office supplier, i would adamently say no to generic at all costs. 
what i do now with my hp 7650 photo printer is i use hp ink for photo's and light text and i purchased a cheap laser printer for most of my black text work. 
it's far more economical to do this than pay out $28 + bucks for ink every 200 pages. 
its like 14 cents verses less than 1 cent a page.
