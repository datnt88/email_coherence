using a router as access point isn't as easy as just using an access point, but tends to be cheaper these days. 
a router typically has a switch, access point, and dhcp server. the most important thing is to turn off the dhcp server. 
it will butt heads with the router you currently have running. 
there is generally a check box to turn that off under dhcp or something like that (nat). the first thing to know is where the main router (linksys wrt54g) is routing, on it's webpage if you select dhcp it should show something like dhcp server enable/disable (enabled of course), starting ip address 192.168.x.100 (x being whatever class c segment it's on; generally 0, 1, or 2) and number of dhcp users (50). 
that means it gives out addresses 192.168.x.100 to 192.168.x.149. 
it is likely at 192.168.x.1 (can be seen under status) for lan port. 
so you need to set the belkin lan to something like 192.168.x.2 for lan port (don't care about wan - your not going to use it). 
reset the belkin and it should work (my netgear did). 
if not you may need a reversing cable between lans (one of the four the linksys lan ports to one of the four belkin lan ports) you don't use the wan at all, turning off dhcp pretty much disabled it.
