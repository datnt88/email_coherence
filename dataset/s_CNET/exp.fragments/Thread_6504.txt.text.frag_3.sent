there is no win2k driver for your nic if the manufacturer does not list one. 
twhen a new device is developed, they do not always write drivers for older oss. 
you should be able to find a pcmcia ethernet adapter for which there is a win2k driver -- if you have that slot available. 
i would expect, however, that a driver could be found for your firewire. 
after all, that was around when win2k was a pup. 
hope this helps frank
