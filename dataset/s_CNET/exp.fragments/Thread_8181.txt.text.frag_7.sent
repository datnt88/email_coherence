i agree that its possible that there isnt a dlna server to be found, and also that it could be due to a windows update. 
i am making sure not to use any antivirus due to the complications. 
there was a definitions update in the last day but i am hoping that just because of that it doesnt remove my dlna server. 
how about the weird thing where it was working just fine then stopped out of nowhere, but still showed up with the verizon fios stb in the input but now since yesterday when the router was logged into and it started working again but i came home today and it was off and now doesnt even show up with the verizon fios stb in the list. 
when i came home today to find that dlna network was gone from my tv i noticed that the wifi adapter that comes with the tv and plugs into usb to give me wireless internet on the tv was not lit up either. 
usually when its plugged in there is a blue light showing its in and active. 
when i looked at it there was no blue light, i had to remove it and plug it in again to get it to turn back on. 
but still not even the fios box is showing up there. 
i did nothing, changed nothing i didnt even turn off the pc let alone change anything or any setting when this started happening. 
now i did try to reset the router again by restoring it to factory settings since it seemed that fixed it but i am only going backwards here since i cant even see the verizon fios stb on there. 
just fiugred i would add this too see if anything clicked, but i dont know what else i can add to try and put the clues there to fix it. 
thanks for trying if you think of anything else i will surely be checking back here. 
take care thanks
