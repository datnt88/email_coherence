didn't have a clue about xp black.. wouldn't know a pirate if it bite me on the back side. 
thank you for letting me know about that. 
will have a serious discussion with the person who sent it to me.. that's the last thing i needed on my computer! 
really angry about it. 
i honestly thought it was just another version. 
thanks again for the heads up. 
they will be dealt with and swiftly. 
please delete my previous post if possible.
