the internal readers need no drivers as they are just like hooking up a hard drive to your pc the os is already built for the use of the product my guess is you have a bad reader or in fact over drawing power on your power supply try plugging it into another usb port if you have one also try using it on another pc to see if it does the same thing to is there a power dongle that plugs into the reader or is it powered only from usb and did you blow any dust out of the usb connector on the pc before you hooked it up knowing more info on your pc specs would help alot
