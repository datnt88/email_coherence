i am wondering if someone can &quot;sell&quot; me on a wireless networking system or if i should just stick with good old ethernet cables. 
i am only hooking 2 computers to a dsl modem. the modem is between the 2, and the distance between the 2 computers is only about 25 ft. 
seems the wireless router and 2 wireless cards i would need cost way more than simply purchasing a wired router and two 25' cords. is there any real need for me to go wireless with this setup??? thanks for any help. 
l.t.
