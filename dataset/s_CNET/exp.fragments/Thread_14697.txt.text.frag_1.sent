i have encountered a puzzler. the asus sk8v motherboard was designed for the amd athlon64 fx-51 processor. 
here's the problem: the registered, tested and recommended memory for the mb is non-ecc. the processor requires ecc memory. 
what do i do? 
i suppose i should go with ecc since i plan to fill all of the dual slots with memory. 
correct? 
not correct? 
i'm confoozled!
