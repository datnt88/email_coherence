i have had a call from my computer repair chap and he tells me that my computer is riddled with viruses (the problems i had had all the appearances of a virus) i have norton internet security and keep it up to date and i scan it all the time but this does not seem to protect he computer, how can you make sure that viruses cannot infect the computer, i thought that norton was pretty good but i was wrong.
