i've also set up 64bit wep security on this network...is this enough for day-to day internet browsing? 
also i have uninstalled zonealarm as belkin said i dont need it. 
apparently the router has a built in firewall. 
i ran symantec security check and it seem to be true....what is everyones opinion on this? 
am i secure from hackers or data theives? 
any info greatly appreciated.
