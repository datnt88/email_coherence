hi, we are having this deauth and deassoc flood attacks, and we have also identified that the attacks are coming from the clients themselves. 
example, a client will suddenly start broacasting on the same channel as an ap. eventually the ap will be jammed and all clients will be disconnected. 
it is like a script running on the machines and it has distributed to several of the clients: the summary is like this: spoof mac, construct de-authenticate, de-assoc, packet, send to broadcast address. 
bam!the network crashes. 
it broadcast with this ssid &quot;intertocuh ghm lobby&quot; any idea of how to remove this? it has made life unbearable. 
ap is dlink dwl-3200. 
clients are xp, vista and windows 7. thanks.
