have only so many chip select lines to the memory sockets. 
this is the technical reason why you see an issue like this. 
what works is to use the memory sticks verified by the machine's maker or to use memory sticks verified by companies like crucial.com let me be clear that unless you get lucky and there is a bios update to give more memory stick support it's likely you have found sticks that don't work. 
not all sticks are created equal or work in all machines. 
fix? 
try all your memory sticks sourced from crucial.com bob
