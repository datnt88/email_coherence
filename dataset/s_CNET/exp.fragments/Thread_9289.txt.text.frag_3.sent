still sounds like a firewall setting, it could be using a different firewall setting for the different connections. 
does it only block 80 or is 443 blocked also (ie can you open the management web page on the routers from these pc? used to be very easy to rule out the browse before microsoft decided we couldn't trust ourselves. the simple way to test if you can see a server is with the telnet command. 
for example telnet 80 get you should see some garbage when you type in get. 
now vista and 7 have disabled telnet by default you have to go into the control panel and turn the feature on. 
basically if you get a response from telnet then the browser is the issue if you do not then something more fundamental is blocking the port. 
although unlikely i would check for firewall settings in one of the routers. 
since it works for some users it is unlikely. 
there should be log entries for any traffic that is blocked. 
this is not a easy one since it would be hard to intentionally configure it to operate as you say it does. 
i still bet its the software firewall on the client but then i have had so many issues with it i use a hardware firewall and disable the software one on my pc's
