hi there could anybody help me im a little confused by the laptop intel core 2 duo mobile processors. the advent 9517 laptop has a t5250 the add says its a 3.8ghz cpu then the advent 5511 has a p7350 at 2ghz can anybody point me to a site that makes sense of these procesors nos etc. there must be a list somewhere that lists them in order of performance. 
i have found a performance list for desktop cpu,s but not for mobile cpu,s many thanks tony b.
