i have a computer which supports dual channel memory. 
i have 4 slots. 
2 orane and 2 yellow can i put 1 stick of kingston 1gb and 1 stick of kingston 2gb together in the same color slots to allow dual channel memory or is it better to put them in seperate color slots. 
and how can i find out the speed of each ram stick without removing it from my pc?
