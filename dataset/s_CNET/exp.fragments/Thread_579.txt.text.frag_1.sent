here's the situation: one plugs in a usb key into a slot that's on the side of the computer. 
the slot is badly designed and does not allow the key to go all the way through. 
the user mistakenly believes that the computer does not recognize the key and turns off the computer, the key still half plugged-in. the computer never turns on again and the hard disk's memory is gone. 
can it be that this is due to the usb key?
