thank you bob for the reply i&quot;m using a gigabyte ga-8ipe775, based on intel's 865pe chipset, with a 3.2 pentium 4 ht processor, its old i know, but its bios has support for usb keyboard, and usb mouse, and even an optoin called support for legacy usb storage devices. 
when i connected a usb keyboard to the computer it worked fine, but when i connect the bluetooth keyboard through the shingle it doesn't work at all. 
so the question is does a keyboard that connect to the computer using bluetooth shingle, should work like a usb keyboard connected directly to the pc? regards ashraf kadry
