okay, the router is not in the basement but it is one floor lower than the wireless computer. 
do you think that moving the router upstairs (and having the downstairs computer be connected wirelessly) would have any chance of helping, or would it just switch the problem from one computer to the other? 
also, i noticed in the manual that it says that the lights on the side of the router should turn off about 10 seconds after it starts up (the blue ones)---they don't. 
they stay on permanently, and resetting the settings didn't help. 
it says that in that case i may have a &quot;hardware problem&quot;---would this possibly be something that could affect performance?
