i use windows home server. 
it clones all my computers, 3 laptops, as well as duplicates the backup. 
it does this daily. 
i had a hard drive go out on one of the computers and it took me around 45 minutes to restore it completely. 
it was like there never was a problem. 
it also allows add ins for additional services as well as a built in remote access for family and friend to access pictures and other files if given permission.
