in the post for football manager, it shows, according to their requirements for the system, that you will need a better graphics than what is shown in the first picture link. 
go to the link from my first post for the football manager site and then do some shopping for a video card. 
first, however, we need to know about your system - like what motherboard you have and what type case and the size of the power supply. 
for the second picture link, you probably have not installed the motherboard drivers, so you need to do that. 
in order to do that you need to know the make and model of the motherboard and either use the driver cd that came with the motherboard or go to the manufactuere's website and download them and install.
