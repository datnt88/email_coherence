i have a 40gb dell inspiron 5100 laptop. 
i surf the net on a home wireless network, linksys. 
i also have a seldom used six year old 30gb desktop. 
my wife and others connect to the wirless network with their laptops. 
all pcs run xp. 
i want to rip 800+ cds to lossless, probably flak. 
evenutally, i'll use the lossless files to stream directly to my home stereo. 
i'll load my ipod with aac versions of the same songs. 
i also want to backup the photos and files on my laptop. 
here is my idea for a solution... 1. i will attach a 500gb mybook world edition to my wireless network. 
2. i will attach a 500gb seagate freeagent pro to my laptop. 
i intend to connect the seagate via a sata adapter, for increased speed. 
3. i'll save lossless and aac files to the seagate with automatic backup [for the lossless files] to the network attached mybook. 
4. i hope to stream music from the mybook to my stereo. 
5. normal laptop backup will be to the seagate with auto backup to the mybook as well. 
so... a. does this make sense? 
b. what type of performance can i expect when i'm backing up to the mybook via a wireless connection? 
c. if i already have a wireless network and router do i need to by the world edition or would any, less expensive, hard drive do the trick? 
d. also open to advice on best places to buy external drives.
