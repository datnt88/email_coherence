consider walgreens, office depot or office max for an advertised 60% savings on ink re-fills. 
if you have them in your area, a fairly new franchise operation called cartridge world boasts similar savings and offers some &quot;guarantees&quot;, but read the fine print (no pun intended). 
good luck!
