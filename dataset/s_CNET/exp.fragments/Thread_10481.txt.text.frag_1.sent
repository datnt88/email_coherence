hi all i need help i have an hp media center pc its the one with all the connections in the front one group of connections is for analog connections for a vcr, dvd, or analog camcorder. 
on hps site it says that if you want to convert old home movies or tape recordings to a digital format is what the front analog connections are for. 
when i connect my analog camcorder to it nothing happens i figure i need some type of software to recognize the front port am i wrong? 
and if i do need some kind of software what do i need all the software i have looked at says it only reads from firewire or usb but not analog i know that i can buy a separate piece of hardware but that defeats the reason of why i bought the hp media center in the first place i wanted the built in analog ports. 
i called hp but they dont know what to do (strange) can someone plz help me
