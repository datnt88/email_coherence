i had an older dell as our second computer. 
since my wife was starting a college course, i wanted her to be able to use our faster, newer computer, but also was working at home using it. 
so we decided that we should get a newer computer a couple of months ago and retire the older dell. 
since i buy a computer to last a few years, i usually pay a little more ($1100) to get something that will last a little longer. 
this time: dell xps-420 q9450 2.66ghz. 
quad-core processor (12mb. 
of cache), fsb 1.33ghz. 
memory 3gb. 
800mhz. 
ddr. 
320gb. 
sata hard drive this desktop works great with windows vista, and i'm very happy with it. 
i think that it has enough horsepower to feel fast for at least a couple of years.
