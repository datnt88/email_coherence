naw, not confused at all, it does seem like many people giving me advice are confused but i have been researching this for 9 months. 
i might not be able to do some things or know it all, but hey what is the forum for. the confusion comes when i get advice that parallels, for example is the way to go and than i read a post with all these other options like the first one in reply to my thread. 
it is too late to cancel without getting penalized. 
i will make it but thanks for the suggestion.
