actually more but 3 copies keeps me in a state of backup when things go sour. 
this forum is full of folk that made one copy and they post here asking how to get it back. 
learn from others. 
and why not put what you have on some dvd? 
that's 4gb and runs about 20 cents here. 
if you don't do that you just set the price on your files.
