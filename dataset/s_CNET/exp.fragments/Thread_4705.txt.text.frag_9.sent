have either sdram slots [164pin] or ddr sdram slots [182 pin] on the mobo. 
once again the dimms are the memory chips , usually eight of which are on mounted on the memory stick. 
again, the memory stick is a small circuit card that has dimms mounted on it. the circuit card is what plugs into the mobo, not the dimms!!!. forget dimms!!!!!!!!!!! or sodimms! 
ddr sdram memory sticks are 182 pin, can be unbuffered [most common], non ecc [most common], or ecc [then will have one more dimm on the card], also can be registered [again not common for normal mobo's. 
the 64 bit amd socket 754 fx51 cpu's require registered memory.
