at this point you test that the crt or display is functioning with another machine. 
if multiple display cards fail to show any bios screen, then the list of failures starts to shrink: 1. the bios settings clear jumper is in the wrong position. 
2. the cmos battery is low, dead. 
3. a cable of other connection is stopping the bootup to the bios screen. 
it was not fun to find a motherboard manual that showed the hd led to be on j11, but j11 turned out to be the reset. 
fortunately the motherboard markings were correct. 
after you ponder the above, then you have to decide if the machine is dead and now you get to find the dead part. 
you also have to tell the forum if you are willing to take the machine down to power supply, cpu/heatsinkfan(hsf), one memory stick and test it our on a cardboard square. 
you also may have to replace some major part like a motherboard or cpu. 
before you start all this, can you revert to what worked or can you put it back to as-supplied and use your warranty?
