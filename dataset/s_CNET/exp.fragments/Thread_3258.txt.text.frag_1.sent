which case should i buy? 
there is the praetorian 730 and the antec p180. 
i have researched both and they both seem like good choices. 
i have recently found the antec p180 at provantage for under $130 with shipping, while newegg offers it for $157.72 with shipping, a rather large price difference for this case. the praetorian 730, no matter where one looks for it, is still $160+ with shipping. 
here are the two cases, both very attractive in my opinion. 
praetorian 730 antec p180 thank you!
