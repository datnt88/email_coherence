you'd be well off to try to correct problems with your troublesome system before adding more potential problems. 
perhaps the best case would be a good cleanup, av and pest scan and attempts to reinstall your apps. 
at worst (and this may not be a bad choice) backup what you can and completely restore your system. 
you can add an external then. 
if your usb is 1.1 and not 2, i would not put an external drive on it at all. the performance of the original usb specifications is pathetic in comparison to usb 2.
