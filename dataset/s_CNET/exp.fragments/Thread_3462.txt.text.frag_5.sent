router firmware updated, too? 
try this: in the list of &quot;preferred networks,&quot; click on the &quot;remove&quot; button to remove the stored connection settings for the network. 
after you do that, either &quot;add&quot; the &quot;preferred network&quot; again, or just try to connect to the detected network. 
any luck?
