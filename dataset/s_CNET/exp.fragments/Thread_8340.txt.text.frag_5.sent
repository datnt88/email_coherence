but then again i installed it. 
where do i backup? 
let me share. 
1. our openssh server. 
let's see a worm get to that! 2. my 1gb memory key. 
(only stuff i want to carry with me and can't lose.) 3. a set of dvdrw disks. 
on item 3 there are 3 sets i rotate around. 
this gives me at any one time 2 copies and lets me change out media should it fail. 
4. another copy to an usb attached drive. 
if i lose it, it would take quite a disaster. 
5. about yearly a set of the family photos is on dvdr and sent off to dad.
