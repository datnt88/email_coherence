i don't know of any way to do this and yes i understand what you are saying. 
what i'm saying is, the os is going to default to the os drive which makes perfect sense and the only way i know is to simply choose your drive until you shut down the pc or whatever, will remain that drive. it may be a pain to move some things to cd but it's a much bigger pain if your hard drive crashes and you lose it all. 
also, understanding what you want, i still see no reason why you can't move most (whatever it is) taking up room on c:, move the stuff to f: and use c: as the download default then. 
the hassles you mention are simply the way it is until everything is completely automated and then perhaps we will complain because we have no control over our computers. 
does that make sense? 
i just want to know.
