i have an emachines t6536 and just bought an evga geforce 7300gt i followed the manual perfectly, (even disabled onboard video adapter), and when i plug the moniter into the new card, and start up my computer, i can hear it logging in (all the normal windows music and stuff) but the screan is blank! 
if i plug the moniter into the onboard, it still works for some reason, and the screan has been loaded! 
this is not the first time this has happened, (other video cards too, all nvidia) i just want to play the games that i bought this computer for.
