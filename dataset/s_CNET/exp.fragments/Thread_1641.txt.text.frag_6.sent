ping ok but browser faulty. 
my windows mce reported that it could not access the program guide , so it threw away my channel settings and guide data. 
i restored my machine , messed about with dns settings . 
it got so that no browser would work , although i could ping anything . 
this took maybe 12 hours work. 
i used the winsockfix , and mce started working again . 
absolutely brilliant. 
i note this in case some other poor soul is fighting mce in a similar way & it could save them a load of time.
