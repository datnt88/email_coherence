i'm only wanting a card close to $60-70. 
i'm going by pricewatch, so that'd mean a fx 5600, 5700, or a radeon 9600, no pro or ultra models. 
i can't seem to find a card in the radeon 9600 listing that isn't se though, so i'm thinking 5600 or 5700. is there much of a different between those two? 
thanks
