hello, im new here i hope i get help.. i need to extend the range of my college wifi to rooms in a nearby building. the wifi is open and is hotspot based: each time i connect, i have to enter my username and password. 
the setup i made: access point on the roof of the building set as station, connected to a switch with 3 cables going down to three different rooms. 
when i try connecting a laptop on lan, it doesnt get automatic ip, so i set up the same ip+subnet+gateway+dns as obtained when connected to the university's wifi. the connection works well ! 
i try connecting 3 laptops simultaneously each with a different ip.. the connection works great on all 3 laptops. 
when i connect just 1 router with static ip... this works fine as well. 
but !! when i try connecting 3 routers exactly like the laptop's configurations, the network fails... i dont know what im doing wrong ! 
(interference is not an issue since the routers are far from each others) please help me.. thank youu
