hello all, i just started collecting and buying parts to build a pc. i want to take your opinion on what type of processor i should get. 
i am looking for a great performance processor. 
i will be doing moderate work and multitasking. 
i am not big on gaming, so i do not want processor that will make me go broke. 
any recommendations will be great thanks
