yes i do have 2.0 usb ports. 
i guess extra info. is better than not enough - sorry! 
i'd love to dump it but i just bought my desktop a few months ago. 
a p4, 3.4 ghz. 
that flies compared to the laptop but i figured it would make a good backup when someone's on the desktop. 
we also go camping & it comes in handy when trying to map your next stop when traveling. but i see a new one possibly from santa so i hate to spend a ton on $ on a card so your suggestion maybe the answer. 
thanks!!
