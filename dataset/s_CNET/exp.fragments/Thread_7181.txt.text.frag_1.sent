hello, i just built a new system with an abit kd7a board and an amd athlon 2200 cpu. 
a few questions-- the cpu speed is setting up as 1500 mhz, is this correct or is it defaulting to a slower speed? 
(i can't find info on the ghz speed of this 2200 cpu anywhere!) note i do not want to overclock . 
. . 
and, should i bother to clear the cmos memory? 
thanks - fj
