i finally got around to hooking up a different monitor to the pc and sure enough, the new monitor works fine with no stand-by issues. 
it goes to sleep and wakes up instantly. 
so the problem lies with either the other monitor itself or the cables attached to this monitor. 
so for now, i just gave him my monitor that has no issues with stand-by. 
thanks again for everyone's help and suggestions!
