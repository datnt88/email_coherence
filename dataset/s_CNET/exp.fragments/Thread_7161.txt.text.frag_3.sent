...i have owned the comp for over a year. 
the radeon card was worth i think he said like $400-$500 new, and the audigy card is im gonna guess worth at least $100. the comp worked for about 2 weeks while i owned it; worked great too. the fan was on the sliding door that went out. 
also, i think that it is a 2000, b/c it isnt shaped like the ones of today....i wish i knew more on the subject really.
