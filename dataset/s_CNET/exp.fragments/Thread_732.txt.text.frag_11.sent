my canon mp530 makes the same loud grinding sounds as many other people are experiencing. 
if you heard it... you'd known immediately it has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;normal head cleaning&quot; or &quot;a dirty rod&quot; or &quot;a paper issue&quot;. 
this is very loud... sounds like 2 large plastic gears violently grinding against each other. 
not sure how that can happen for more than a few times without totally destroying the printer. 
my printer has been doing it since the day i bought it, 4 years ago. 
i've taken the printer apart many times, trying to locate the noise... but nothing looks like it's having a problem. the noise must be coming from something inside deeper than a partial disassemble would reveal. 
needless to say, i'll never buy anything with the word &quot;canon&quot; on it again.
