no.. you *don't* need to spend lots of money on a router. 
just grab an old computer...and i do mean old...i am using an old repurposed pentium pro... pop in a wifi card (you can get these for like $15 online). 
download monowall (free) and burn it to a cd. pop the cd into your ancient computer and boot off of the cd. configure monowall, set up captive portal, redirect all wifi traffic to a login webpage where you control the password. 
hand out the password to anyone who asks...change the password every week...leaches gone!!!
