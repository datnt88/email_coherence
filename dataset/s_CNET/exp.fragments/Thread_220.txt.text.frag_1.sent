iam trying to add a ultra ata barracuda seagate 7200 40gig to a dell dimension 4700 desktop with sata hdd installed and working perfectly already. 
i have added the hdd to the cable which is used to connect to the cd rom. 
i enabled the hdd in bios. 
but still not able to detect in winxp. 
there are three setup available in the jumper. 
1. master/slave 2. cable select 3. limits drive capacity i tried all three but still no success. 
any pointer would be of helpful.
