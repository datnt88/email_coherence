if you goto a big electronics store like bestbuy circut city and maybe fry's electronics, if you live near one, if you look at the network cables they are either bare or have a little rubber shield over the end. 
there are many out there and just as cheap as bare ones. 
other solution: tape that suckuh into the socket! 
good luck
