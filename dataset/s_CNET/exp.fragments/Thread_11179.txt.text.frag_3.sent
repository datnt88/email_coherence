thanks for the reply - a couple of things: the 127 gb limit won't be a problem as the sata drive i want to use is only 80 gb. i've looked some more and saw what might be another option - an adapter that connects between a sata drive and the ide socket on a motherboard. 
found one on amazon for less than four bucks including shipping, so i'll give that a try.
