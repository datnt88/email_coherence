i found a refurbished hp/compaq evo at i believe overstock.com. 
it had a pentium processor, a 40 gig hd, half a gig of ram, a dvd drive (useless for this application), and xp pro. 
i upped the ram to one gig, installed a d-link wireless g pci card, and connected it to my sony 55&quot; sxrd with a vga monitor cable. 
powered it up, found my network, and voila. 
i believe i spend about 150 for the pc, and in total about 200 bucks. 
oh, i bought a wireless keyboard and mouse for about 30 bucks. 
so make it 230 bucks total. 
i can stream anything from anywhere. 
you don't need a lot of bells and whistles.
