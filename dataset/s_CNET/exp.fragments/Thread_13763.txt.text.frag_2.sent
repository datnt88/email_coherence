ok so i got on my computer one day and i couldn't listen to music. 
i went control panel, then to sound and audio devices, and where it used to say the sound card i have, it just says no audio devices. 
i know i have a sound card, but i think my sound card might have come loose or something when i was messing with my computer. 
i have no idea how to check or anything. 
can someone please help me to figure out how to get my sound card to work? 
thanks
