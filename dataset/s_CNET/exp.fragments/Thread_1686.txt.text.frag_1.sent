hi guys... we have an up to date comp which was purchased in the last 6 months... and i'v got an older laptop coming from ebay... i would like to network the 2 so i can share files and share a adsl internet connection (connected to the comp).. i'v seen these little sticks called a wireless usb network i have 2 links to ones on ebay (sorry i wasnt sure where else to link to for examples) i'm guessing my laptop hasnt got a network card in it... but has a usb... will any of these items work? 
and my last question is do i need one at both my pc and laptop?
