agree with bob , however that drive is sold as a usb/firewire external so there are two possibilities. 
you can try a usb splitter cable that has two plugs that plug into two of yourusb ports and deliver the sum of the two ports' output to your device. 
i have been using this arrangement for over a year with no problems.however in the event that your laptop can't put out enough juice you can get a very small usb adapter that you connect to one of the cable branches while the other plugs into your computer for data transfer. 
i think you'll find the first arrangement will work for you as an inexpensive approach regards seewart
