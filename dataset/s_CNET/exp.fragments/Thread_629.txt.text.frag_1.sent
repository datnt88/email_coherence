i plan on buying my mbp soon, but i only have one printer with two computers. 
what excatly do i need to get airport going. 
do i need the base station or just the airport express base. 
i have wireless internet (dsl i think) and would like to not have to plug and unplug my printer when i need to print things. 
thanks
