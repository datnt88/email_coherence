very wise!there was an excellent bbc prog: on this very subject of wireless pcs! they had a couple of guys cruising a housing estate in a car, and it seems they could pick up every wirless connection on a laptop. 
most were not secure, and even those that were could be hacked! 
glad i watched it as i was about to go over to wireless, not anymore, im sticking to wired connections. 
have a nice one. 
ps. sorry about capitals, i have an optical disadvantage.
