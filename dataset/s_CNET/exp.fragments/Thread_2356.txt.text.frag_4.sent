good to know it was mostly firmware. 
to tell if it is the internet or your network you can run a continuous ping between your machines and then a ping to something like 4.2.2.2. if both numbers vary at the same time it is your network, if it is only the internet then its most likely a isp load issue. 
if you set your connection to only g her machine will just drop down to g. this has most likely been happening all along you just did see it. 
if only she was using the wireless then it would run n as soon as you activated you g machine it would force her to run g... or it may jump back and forth depends on the router and what threshold is set for the switching. 
still g is much much faster than your internet so it should not run worse and if you are lucky it will run a little better. 
hard to say what would be cause of the short hangs. 
if it is only the wireless machines it could be intermittent interference.
