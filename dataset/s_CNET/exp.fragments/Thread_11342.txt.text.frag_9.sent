first and foremost, i highly, highly recommend that you consider the distinct advantages to switching over to dedicated server hosting, as the hodge-podge of components you have are not nearly enterprise grade in comparison to the functions you expect and the configuration you are trying to make work. 
that being said, the hub idea would not work, usb does not work the same way as a network, and all 3 servers cannot access the usb device at the same time. 
the only proper way to do this with external drives is to have 3 separate external drives, one for each server. 
if you are worried about redundancy you can network those shares and then back them up to a central san.
