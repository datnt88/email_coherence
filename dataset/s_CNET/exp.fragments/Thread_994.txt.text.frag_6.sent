i have the misfortune of getting a belkin wireless g usb/wifi unit. 
i get the same error code 10 as you. 
i called belkin, and after trying a couple of things the lady suggested. 
she told me the unit was faulty. 
i took it back to the store, and the same happened with the exchange. 
so i called belkin again, and i asked for level 2 support. 
i was given the run around by some guy that could barely speak english named john or something like that. 
anyway, i have already written belkin and complained about the unit and their lack of understandable customer support.. i al also throwing away about 250 dollars worth of belkin hardware; working or not. 
i have already obtained a d-link router, and next i am going to try a d-link or linksys wifi unit (usb is first on the try list). 
i have no problems with getting a signal of other networks on my wifi, but belkin wifi so far is unimpressive trash.
