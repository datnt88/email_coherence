is that it should not matter if the connection is there or not. 
however we have reality and with some million different pcs you can't state it will or will not matter. 
we know that folk have tried to play a movie and game at the same time so i commented on that result. 
as to it simply being plugged in, you'll have to test what happens. 
should not matter but as you suspect, it might matter.
