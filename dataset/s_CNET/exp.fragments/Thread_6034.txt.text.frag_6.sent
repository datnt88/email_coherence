either you push ahead or you don't. 
there is a standard in these drives and if you find a machine that doesn't work then the machine is busted and it's not your issue. 
i know some companies that failed to understand this and ended up doing free tech support on those machines as well as one case where they sent the user a new laptop. 
my advice here is don't fall for that trap.
