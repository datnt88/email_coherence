i have a laptop running xp professional. 
my desktop is an imac with the latest version of the mac os. i have a dlink di524 router connected to the imac. 
i connect wirelessly with the laptop. 
i can print directly from the laptop to a epson stylus c88 when i plug it directly into the laptop. 
is it possible to print wirelessly from my laptop? 
i do have sharing turned on in the printer preferences on the imac. 
thanks for any assistance. 
in the unlikely event that it helps i also have parallel software running on the imac. 
jon
