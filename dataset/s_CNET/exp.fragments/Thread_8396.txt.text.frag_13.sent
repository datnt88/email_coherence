aptivaa12 i have a hp pavilion w1907 lcd monitor. 
it is doing exactly the same thing as these other monitors. 
it goes black. 
if i turn it off...then back on...it will come on but only for 2-3 seconds. 
i bought it as a package and one month after the warranty expired...bam! 
dang it all...this ain't right! 
any how...i took it apart according to this page ( ) but...i don't know for sure what i'm doing (not computer talented) class action suit is what's needed...that's for sure. 
i emailed the ceo of hp with this problem awhile back. 
good luck try'in to get a reply. 
anyway...do you fix computers? 
i see where you offered another person to fix theirs. 
anything to help would be greatly appreciated! 
thanks for your time on this matter.
