i just purchased a samsung galaxy tab2 .. mini tablet .. love it .. and i'm 71 3/4s! it is android os, can get kindle app as well as nook app, many many apps, as well as email, internet, etc .. and it fits easily into a purse/messanger bag-type to carry with you. 
of course the best thing is the cost .. i had originally purchased the kindle fire hd to replace my several years old kindle keyboard .. then started looking at the difference in price between it ($199) and having a 'real' computer - the samsung was $249 .. so for $50 more i received much more and i love it!
