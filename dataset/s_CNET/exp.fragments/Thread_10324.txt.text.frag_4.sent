i just switched from a linksys wireless g router to a dlink extreme wireless n router - dir 655. the difference is night and day. 
now the kids play their online games and the internet works perfectly. 
no one complains of slow load times. 
i had to many issues with the linksys. 
set up with the dlink was a breeze. 
consider this one another option.
