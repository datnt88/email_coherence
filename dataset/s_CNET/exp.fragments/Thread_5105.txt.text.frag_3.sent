i appreciate your wiilingness to look at the documentation and i really feel stupid asking this question, but i can't find anywhere in this forum thread where i can attach a pdf file of the manual. 
i can reply with the instructions in the message body, but the chapter on the raid controller is 17 pages long. 
i have searched the faqs and every other place on this site, but cannot find where i can upload the pdf. 
please forgive my ignorance, but this is the first forum where i've encountered this problem. 
thanks, jeff
