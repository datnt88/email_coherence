the error is a missing operating system. 
both have xp. we tried to reboot every possible way. the recovery disc offers a standard recovery and a full reformat but i would like to recover &quot;my documents&quot;. 
i was told that a crossover connection could get me access to my pc hard drive even though it will not boot. is that incorrect info? 
you recommended putting hard drive in another pc or a usb the 2 together? 
the usb would be easiest. 
instruction would be welcomed, thanks for your thought and assistance.
