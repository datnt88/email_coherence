does anyone know where i can learn what the ideal cpu temperature is? 
i've heard 45 deg c when not being used and 65 deg c when heavily active. 
i've been annoyed with my fan running at 80% all the time to ensure that my cpu stays cool. 
so i just lowered it to around 65% and now my temperature hovers around 65% when i'm gaming. 
i want to make sure i'm not going to blow the darn thing up. 
thanks ahead of time.
