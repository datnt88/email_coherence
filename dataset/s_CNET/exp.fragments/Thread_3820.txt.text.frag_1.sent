my problem is that my pc has lost its operating system and now i am trying to connect my laptop to my pc with a crossover connection. 
i am hoping that i can get to my pc's hard drive to copy &quot;my documents&quot; to another folder or to my laptop. 
looking for some step by step directions. 
can't seem to find my pc in my network places. 
where am i going wrong? 
thanks for your help.
