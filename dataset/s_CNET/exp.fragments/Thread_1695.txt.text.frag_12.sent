thanks for the tip about memtest. 
i've run the ram in single channel mode and i get less errors, still not error free unfortunately. the reason i suspect the power supply is that i recently (within the last 6 months) added a few power draining components. 
a 256mb video card (which specifies needing a psu of at least 300) and a 300gb hard drive. 
i was unaware of the strenght of the power supply and adding 4x's the ram may have been enough to drain all the power. 
is that a fair assumption? 
thanks for your help!
