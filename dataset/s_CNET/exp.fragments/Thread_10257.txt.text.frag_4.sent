i've called a couple places but they involve bringing the paperwork to them. 
unfortunately, i cannot do that. 
this is a court case where in order to prove the business income, i have to go to the business and copy or scan the documents on site. 
i'm not allowed to cut or or otherwise manipulate the receipts other than to fold them. 
if used a camera with a 28mm lens does anyone know if that would be readable? 
i could copy all the receipts with a commercial copier rental but that would be 5 pages per receipt and the cost would add up quickly. 
thanks.
