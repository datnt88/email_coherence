okay, after finding out where disk management was (stupid vista), i probably could've learned that the disk was &quot;not initialized.&quot; 
might've fixed my problem before i decided to use the wd diag to write zeros to the entire disk. 
course, that is if initializing didn't force you to reformat the drive anyway. 
just my luck.
