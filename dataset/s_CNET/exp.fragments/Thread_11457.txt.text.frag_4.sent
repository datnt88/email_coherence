before you make changes to your machine, save a copy of the hdd to some external drive. 
i use clonezilla and while it takes hours (i let it backup overnight) it beats the pain when i want to try something dangerous. 
fixing a tech's custom hack installed xp after vista job needs a lot of explaining how they did that. 
also you have to have the xp cd used to install xp as well as the vista dvd for some boot repairs. 
if there is no other choice and you are willing to risk it all, go get easybcd from and see if you can repair the boot manager.
