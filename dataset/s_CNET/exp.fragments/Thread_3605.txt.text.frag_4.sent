well it is more cost effective to buy a box new but there's a lot to be said for the fun and satisfaction of building it yourself. 
plus you get to post to this forum a lot more!! one thing you might want to start with is buying a bunch of $5 parts on ebay and building a 450 mhz machine just to practice building, and to use your old parts.

90% of your computer jobs can be done very well with a pii machine, and it's good to have a spare for e mail if you screw up your main box. 
when building a state of the art new machine, my advice: don't skimp on the case. 
this was my most expensive lesson. 
cooling the overall system is, for the most part, not mentioned by makers of individual components, and a big fan on the cpu may not be enough. 
the size of the case is a factor. 
just pay attention to that-- and, of course, don't zap the components with static electricity.
