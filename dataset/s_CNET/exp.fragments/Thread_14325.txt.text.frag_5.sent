there are papers specifically optimized for laser printing and some for ink jet. 
others are just generic copy machine paper. 
if you are interested in producing a quality product yourself, you will need to use quality materials. 
both hp an hammermill make papers which specify their intent to be used on laser printers. 
i prefer 24lb as a minimum. 
if you examine the surface of laser papers versus others, you can see something about the sheen and lack of visible texture in them. 
this must enhance their apparent sharpness compared to inkjets which rely somewhat on absorbsion characteristics. 
laser toners are fused with heat on top of the paper rather than be absorbed into the paper fibers as are inks. 
it makes sense when you think about it. 
watch for the sale prices and promos and stock up when you can.
