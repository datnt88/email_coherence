hey guys. 
thanks to all that replied to my post ''where to buy a pc...circuit city or best buy''. 
in it, i asked about the in store service plans offered by both stores but no one commented on that aspect of the posting. 
personally, i never buy those extended service plans they always try to push but since i've heard so many bad things about tech support from many of the leading pc manufacturers i was considering buying an in-store protection plan. 
however, after finding this website, where a bunch of sales people, mostly from circuit city, talk about how useless the cityadvantage service plan is, i'm thinking maybe i should pass. 
the one thing i liked about hp was that their warranty (1 yr parts/labor) could be extended at anytime within the first year. 
i think with cc and bb you have to buy their plans at the time you buy the pc, even though most of the coverage doesn't kick in until after the manufacturers warranty expires. 
i'll have to see if gateway offers the same option to extend the warranty like hp does. 
from what i've read, most things covered under the manufacturers warranty will happen within the first year anyway so an extended warranty may just be a waste of money. 
i figure that if i have more than one major problem in the first year than maybe extending the warranty might be a good move. 
i purchased the 2 year x-warranty for my dell and can't remember ever using it even once and my dell is about 5 years old and still running.
