i've asked everywhere and nobody seems to have an answer...i am hoping that cnet or a cnet member can help me out. 
i am trying to save a little money - but if i have to pay someone then i will. 
my isp is a wifi provider. 
i don't use a cable or dsl modem to access the internet. 
i connect with network adapter. 
now, i want to network my other cpu's, my laptop, my ps2, and provide internet connection for my psp. 
my isp told me that i need to purchase a bridge and wifi router. 
they told me to purchase a senao bridge and netgear router. 
i did both but i need to know how to set it up. 
any info would help.
