i have had several dell's and maintain my families hp's and toshibas...at least 10 times have been advised to reformat the hard drive by customer &quot;service&quot;. 
worst offender is dell. 
once i was dumb enough to do it. 
took all day to reinstall and didn't fix the problem. 
when i threatened to bill them for my wasted time with copy to my attorney they finally sent out a tech to replace the defective motherboard...which is what i suggested was the problem in the fist place. 
if tech support ever suggests reformatting your hard drive ask them for a detailed explanation of what they expect that to accomplish...other than to keep you busy and out of their hair for a long time...when what you hear back from them amounts to a long pause or a big &quot;duh&quot;, hang up or log off and get another rep who will actually listen to you and knows what the problem/solution is. 
bottom line, unless a virus has eaten up a good bit of your data, there is little good that reformatting will do.
