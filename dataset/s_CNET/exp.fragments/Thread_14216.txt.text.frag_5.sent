most routers are capable of configuring wds. 
this allows the two routers to communicate with each other and still support your wireless devices. 
you should refer to your owner manuals to see if you have this option. 
wds has it's downsides though. 
you cut your throughput in half and the connection is not always the most stable. 
keep this in mind.
