there is no guarantee that the files will ever be safe once they are in the cloud, if that &quot;cloud&quot; is not controlled by the owner of the files. 
any cloud storage is subject to certain risks so it becomes a matter of what information is being pushed up there, and the potential liability. 
in most all cases the data is safe. 
an individual's information from an everyday business would probably not be of much interest to those who have the ability to hack into it. the level of protection that one might be looking for is directly related to the sensitivity of that data. 
that said, even banks and other keepers of personal information have had breaches. 
there are risks. 
make a decision as to what level your information needs protection and i'd wager that the more protected it needs to be, the more valuable your overall business is as well, therefore, you can manage to pay for the additional protection. 
i think a secure dropbox account is a reasonable choice for most businesses. 
as well the data that is pushed into the box can be password protected, and encrypted. 
at the risk of wash, rinse, repeat: determine the value of your information and seek out the level of storage and protection you need.
