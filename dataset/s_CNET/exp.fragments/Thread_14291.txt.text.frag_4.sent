i recently receive an ipad for father's day. 
it isn't a replacement for a computer. 
it is however, a great device to use for what you need to use it for: web browsing, emails, youtube. 
download some apps to make it more productive (some free, some cost $). 
i also own an ipod touch, and the ipad is much better to use. the large screen is a pleasure to look at. 
all of the ipod touch screen manipulations function on the ipad too. 
but the ipad doesn't connect directly to a digital camera (interface cables are available i think), nor can you install ms office (but the ipad can download compatible programs).
