home computer, general internet, email, some excel, word, basic photo editing, light video streaming, no gaming. 
will i notice a real world difference between an intel 2.5 ghz core 2 quad q8300 running 6 mb ddr2 and an amd 3.0 ghz quad phenom ii x4-945 running 8 mb ddr2, both windows 7 64bit? 
the amd computer is $100 more and large, the intel is small form factor, which i like. 
thanks for your input!
