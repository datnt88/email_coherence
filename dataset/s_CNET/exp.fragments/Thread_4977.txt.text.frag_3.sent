make sure you unplug the pc from ac power before doing anything inside. 
re the rest...start by making sure it's 'relatively' dust free. 
especially make sure the cpu heatsink and fan are to the max extent possible free of dust. 
same with power supply and case fans. the other thing is backup ... storing your must have data somewhere in addition to you pc hdd.
