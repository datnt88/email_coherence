why can't i map a drive between two pcs on my home network? 
both ethernet cards are installed properly in device manager on the respective machines, configured with ips on the same subnet. 
i can ping each machine from the other, so there is connectivity. 
however whenever i try to map a drive i get the error message that the machine cannot be found on the network. 
firewalls are down, the drive i want to map to has been shared, yet i can't still seem to map. 
any ideas?
