hi, i have a netgear wgr614 wireless router that is connected to a cable modem in one part of the house. 
i'm thinking of getting vonage, and if i do, i will get a free linksys wrtp54g wireless router. 
in my studio in another part of the house (within wireless range), i have a macbook and a dell desktop running ubuntu. 
currently, i have the macbook connected to the netgear via wireless, and the dell wired to the macbook with an ethernet cable. 
i am sharing the internet connection from the macbook with the desktop. 
now, here's the issue: if i get the linksys wireless router, it will be set up in place of the netgear. 
i would like to use the netgear as a sort of &quot;distribution point&quot; for a subnet in my studio... to put that differently, i would like to have the netgear router in my studio, and have my laptop and desktop hard-wired into it via ethernet. 
i would then like to have that netgear router connect to the linksys over wifi, and distribute that connection over ethernet (sort of like what i am using my laptop for now, except without the need to have a computer on all the time). 
i don't really care if it rebroadcasts the signal, as i don't really need that. 
i just want a connection available to the desktop, even when my laptop is not powered on or available. is it possible to do this?
