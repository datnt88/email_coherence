i'd move the repeater closer to the router. 
even a few feet may help. 
i'll share i picked up a refurb wpnt834 for 70 bucks and the range has been amazing. the first thing i did was go get the latest firmware and set it up the way i do all over. 
that is, stock settings then broadcast the ssid and wpa for security. 
it's on the far side of my house and i can connect to it two houses down 300 feet away. 
very nice. 
i also have the buffalo whr-hp-g54 which was 50 bucks and loaded the white russian with webif firmware. 
same settings of stock, ssid and wpa. it connects well at the house 2 doors door. 
i'm unsure why you would need repeaters unless your firmware is old or you disabled ssid broadcast.
