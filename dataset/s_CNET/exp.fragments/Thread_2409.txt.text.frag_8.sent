this may sound silly but if you are using a windows operating system that uses dos as the underlying software .. as in win 95,win 98, win 2000 ..etc.. using the old dos commands may help you in copying your data to another drive or discs formatted in dos.. just a suggestion. 
dos works very slowly but it does work . 
for your info dos is the original operating software using command.com that is present in most windows products.. i am not sure whether this is true however for windows xp. good luck
