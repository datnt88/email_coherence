wow that is an extreme system. 
although, if you do do gaming, you might want to look more at amd. they are the best when it goes to gaming. 
everything looks good, and the power supply should handle that, but you should look at antec's new line of true power ii. 
water cooled - nice gpu - either is fine where is your hard drive btw? 
i would say go 2 raptors in raid 0 and maybe add another 120gb drive cuz you have alot of moooonay! 
case - ??? i would recomend the new p180 from antec. the cooling on this is superb esp if you choose intel. 
yah other than that, you are building a beast.
