as i mentioned in my reply to the storage forum topic &quot;poll: be honest:...&quot; i do several levels of backup, including: 1. &quot;archived&quot; photos and music - on site and out of home sets of dvds 2. yearly back ups onto dvds of essentially all user files, including new photos and music, mostly at home but a current one at a friend's house. 
3. all current user files saved on a seagate free agent pro, which also gets weekly nero backups. 
4. most user files saved on-line at mozy. 
having had two hdd failures, i'm glad i had backups.
