i have been thinking about this for a while, and was wondering, why do some applications that work as some kind of server require you to open up ports on the firewall blocking you from the internet, while others don't (i just used ultr@vnc and logmein as an example). 
to the best of my understanding, logmein goes through their server and acts as kind of a proxy between the viewer and the host, and ultr@vnc can be set up to do this as well. 
however, i would like to know the technical side of this, and why some internet connections are allowed while others aren't. 
care to shed some light on this subject for me? 
thanks!
