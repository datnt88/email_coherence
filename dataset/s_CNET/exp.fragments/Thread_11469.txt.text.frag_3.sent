i just checked your link, maybe i'm missing it, but i see that the article talks about how cnet tests dvd burners, i didn't happen to see anything about removing the region protection from dvd's. 
i am in europe and i'd like to have the ability to watch american dvd's i bought when i was over there, but i'd also like to be able to watch any dvd i might buy here in europe, so that's basically where i'm heading with this. 
thanks, george
