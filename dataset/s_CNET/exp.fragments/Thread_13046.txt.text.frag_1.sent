i want to setup a wireless network in my home but dont know were to start i own two dell laptops an inspiron 1000 and an inspiron 1501. 
both have xp operating systems. 
i also have a dell 926 all in one printer. 
currently to access the internet i go online with an old windows 98 dial up system. 
i want to get rid of this one all together. 
im going with either dsl or cable with my network. 
i dont plan on replacing the desktop. 
i know that i will need a modem with dsl or cable for a high speed internet access. 
if i understand it right the modem will be connected to a router? 
after that im lost. the inspiron 1000 has a plug in 1390 adapter the other laptop has a 1490 wireless card installed. 
i have used both in wi-fi hotspots without problems. 
do i connect the printer direct to the router or use a device like a dell 3300 wireless printer adapter? 
my 1501 came with norton security installed with a firewall. 
i know i will need a firewall of some kind to protect my files but dont know how to set it up on the whole network. 
i dont even know which router to buy? 
i have more questions than answers at this point. 
im in hopes i can find help here for those not at all knowable when it comes to networking.
