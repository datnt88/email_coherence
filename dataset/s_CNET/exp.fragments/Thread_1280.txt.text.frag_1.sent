if this topic already has a thread, i apologize- i couldn't find it. 
i have several external hds that i use primarily for music and image storage. 
from time to time, the drive letters associated with a particular hd will switch to another drive letter. 
this renders the pathing of my playlists useless! is there a way to 'lock' a drive letter to a specific hd?
