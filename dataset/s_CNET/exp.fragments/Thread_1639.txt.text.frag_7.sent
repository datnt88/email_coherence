there are many software sync solutions out there. the raid 1 solution is very narrow in what it solves and after watching it fail the owners over the years i have to ask questions about the goals and what they are trying to solve. 
i think you have thought it over and see where raid 1 fails us. 
for the pc we have sync software solutions aplenty so you can do more research on that. 
i use syncback and since only the changes get copied, it's not a lot of work. 
for the apple there is fsync, folder sync, and the list never seems to end such as now that's a backup. 
if you have a drive fail, the other is ready with its copy. 
if you delete a file, the spare is still there. 
if i save a word document on top of another with the wrong name, i'm covered. 
now that's backup.
