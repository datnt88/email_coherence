the ati x200 integrated graphics are adequate for dvd playback. 
even if u upgrade graphics card, it'll probably show little or no difference. 
also the quality of the image is also from monitor so good monitor also produces good images. 
unless ure in gaming, i would not suggest getting a gfx card. 
if u still want to upgrade the gfx card, i would go for a nvidia 6200 or radeon x300. 
both are adequate for everyday applications and are pretty decent with new games on like super low settings. 
however they are good for playing older games.
