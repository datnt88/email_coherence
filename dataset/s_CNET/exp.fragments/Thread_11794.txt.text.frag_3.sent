thankyou for replying bob! 
i have a wireless router (d-link dir615) for my network and everything is connecting ok most of the time, but my wii and sony blu ray need to connect for firmware updates. 
i have the ability to go online with the wii but also need a method of hooking up the blu ray. it would complete my system if there was better range to work between floors in my home! 
-both have web accessability. 
wii has usb but i believe sony uses rj45. 
my connection isn't always present.
