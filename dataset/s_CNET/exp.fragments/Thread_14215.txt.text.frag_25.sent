i put in a new motherboard recently and couldn't figure out why i could no longer access my ide hd. i have a sata hd running as my main drive and another ide hd, formerly my main one, that i use for music files and backup storage. 
it used to work but after the mobo install the bios recognized an unknown drive instead of the other hd. it was driving me crazy. 
jumper settings did nothing. 
nothing showed in windows xp at all-didn't show up in disk management either. 
i've looked all over but couldn't find anything related to this issue online. 
i finally read your post and remembered that was how i had altered it before(accidentally, about a year and a half ago) to get it to work. the ide hd had to be on the secondary ide cable in order for it to be recognized by the sata drive. 
i just switched the cables, put my dvd and cd writer drives on the primary ide cable instead, restarted, and voila! 
my drive lettering is messed up now a:floppy c:sata hd ------ ok so far, then f:dvd emulator g:ide hd h:cdrw i:dvd no d: or e:? before, the cd and dvd drives were e: and f:, the hd(when it was recognized) was still g: not sure why it happened (i might try removing all emulation drives first and see what happens-that's a known issue with drive lettering iirc) but it's a minor issue compared to not being able to retrieve my music/itunes folder and backup info. 
thanks for posting the information, bad english or not-it was good enough for me and a great help:)
