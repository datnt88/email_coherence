hi bob-- i had only one path-- thru the surge protector. 
it was a fancy one that allowed for the high speed internet cable to go thru, so all wires leading into the computer (and power for all its peripherals) went thru the surge protector. 
so i repeat my question: how do i prove the mobo failure was caused by the surge protector's failure to protect it and not just the mobo dying a natural death? 
-- fj (fyi, currently the internet cable does not work if it goes thru the surge protector in-outs . 
. . 
sorry if that was confusing, it was going thru the surge protector before)
