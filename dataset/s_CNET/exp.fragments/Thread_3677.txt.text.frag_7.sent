i can't boot the disk as a startup disk because the packlock is locked and i need an admin pass to make changes. 
i don't understand why i cannot boot from a disk. 
surely you can boot from any disk right? 
is there software available to overwriye the admin password protection? 
if not i think i'm going to have to buy a new hdd
