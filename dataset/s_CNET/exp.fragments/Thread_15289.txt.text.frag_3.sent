usually, it leaves only the psu and mtrbd. 
to content with. 
unplug the ac cord and depress the power-on button for a 10sec.. return ac cord and try to power-on again. 
if it works, you got a bad power relay on mtrbd.. if not, then again bad mtrbd. 
or psu. the psu supplies more than one voltage, just because the fan runs means only 12v is present. 
you can also try the to clear the cmos using the clearing pins/pads. 
this will reset it to defaults and may clear a problem or not. 
i would swap out the psu as a 1st step in a repair. 
if that doesn't work, test other components elsewhere(if possible) like ram, etc.. if you do have any warranty, use it before going hog wild on repair attempts as that may void warranty. 
computability is critical, it may fit but still not work on cpu sockets, so you do have to know before swapping any parts.
