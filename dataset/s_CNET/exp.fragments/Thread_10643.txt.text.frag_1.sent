hello, for a variety of reasons i want to replace my old verizon supplied westell c90-36r516-01 adsl modem with a zoom 5554a. 
i can configure the zoom modem and write settings to flash no problem however i have not been able to get an internet connection. 
client machines always get an ip address from the modem but the modem doesn't appear to get an ip address itself. 
in the diagnostics the modem ip address is shown as 0.0.0.0 i get a solid green adsl light on the modem and the diagnostics always pass the atm tests. 
i've tried both 1483 bridged llc and pppoe llc as the encapsualtion methods. 
i expect my circuit uses 1483 for several reasons inlcuding: -my old modem appears to be pre-pppoe -i don't use a pppoe connectoid, just a normal connection for my dlink nic -i've never needed a password to connect using the westell modem -verizon tech support told me my circuit uses dhcp (which i construe to mean 1483 bridged llc/dhcp) -the verizon online help tool also suggests that my circuit uses dhcp client machines have included an older compaq ez2600 and a newer dell dimension both running winxp home sp2. 
there are no firmware upgrades listed on the zoom website for the 5554a. 
i've also tried different phone cords, jacks and ethernet cables any additional ideas for configuring the modem or diagnosing this problem would be appreciated
