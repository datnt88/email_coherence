i'm a student and i spend about 80% of my time in a lab at school where i have my own personal computer and where it tends to get extremely loud. 
i know i can just go out and buy any earphone for under 100$ and just crank up the volume until my brain is deteriorated by the bass vibrations and i start to drool all over myself, but i consider myself to have a pretty good ear and would like to keep it that way. 
so now my question is, are there earphone out there (preferably in-ear but not restricted to) that can completely block out outside noise, like people not understanding that a 3 to 4 feet of air in between two people does not block sound and yell at the top of their lungs? 
or if not what is the best noise cancellation (active or passive) earphone out there somebody can get, i know they can get pretty expensive but right now that's not the main issue. 
i just want to be able to concentrate on what i'm doing and not hear people yell about whether they prefer tampons or pads and not damage my ear drumbs
