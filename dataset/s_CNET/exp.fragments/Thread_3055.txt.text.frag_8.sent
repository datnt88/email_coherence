upgrading is reasonably cheap these days, so if you can afford it do both at the same time. 
i found multi-tasking a huge problem with 256ram even when i got my machine updated (only 256 came with the new motherboard). 
so when i could afford it, i brought an extra 512ram. 
i have now got both 256 + 512 in my machine. 
this runs both programs (and games) great and simultaneously.processor 
speed doesn't help if you don't have the memory for the programs to go there (and the processor to use that space - they are all interconnected like your body). 
if you were to keep your old machine without updating the processor, get an extra 512 (not 256) and if will help tremendously. 
if you go the other option, and go through someone who does upgrades make sure you can either keep you old equipment in your pc or trade it in on the price of the upgrade. 
also see if they can do a deal for higher memory (ram) packages. 
most newer computers take ddr ram and you won't be able to use your old ram in them once you upgrade. 
hope thats been helpful.
