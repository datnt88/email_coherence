tray/face plate that came with the case don't line up ( and they should line up and mount properly ).....then try one of the other adapters. 
like you, i have a smartcard reader that would fit in a 3.5 floppy drive but i chose to put it into a 3.5&quot; to 5.25&quot; adapter tray (second link above) and it fits and installs exactly as intended. 
let us know how it works out.
