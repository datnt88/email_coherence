your typical maxtor, wd, seagate and others will have what they call a 5-year service life and rated for so many actuations of the mechanical parts. the only people i see lose hard disks are ... 1. my neighbor whose screensaver is one labeled &quot;disk defragmenting...&quot; 2. my other neighbor. 
house hit by lightning. 
now believes in circuit protectors. 
3. joe gamer. 
built a fast box, but let it cook since he didn't like all that fan noise. 
4. grace.

there is no correct answer.
