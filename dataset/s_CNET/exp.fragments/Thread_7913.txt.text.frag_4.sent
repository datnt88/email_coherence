my video card is the old agp style (not pci) i don't believe i am pulling to many watts, although i may repalce the psu in the future, maybe at the same time i have been looking for an agp that can do windows 7 anyway, my main question is will i see any big difference for everyday computing (surfing / email) or is the video card really just for gaming? 
i may do some basic video rediting (cam corder family movies), does it help this?
