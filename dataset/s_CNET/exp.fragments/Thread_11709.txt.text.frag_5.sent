my lexmark started the same thing. 
programs other than excel and word print black fine. 
if i highlight the text and choose a color close to black (so close i can't tell the difference) it prints fine. 
i just chose one of the black squares one notch up from black. 
i still do not know what the problem is i have a new cartridge. 
have you found out what is wrong?
