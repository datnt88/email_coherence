i think it is just my own way of doing things. 
even with my ancient machine, i have 3 internal hard drives and 10 external hard drives. 
i won't go into the reasoning for this - just that it is the way i do things. 
two video ports is great. 
i am going to split the difference between the haswell and its many cores and the dual core. 
at this moment i am planning on going with intel's dz77ga70k mobo and intel core i7 3770k which are compatible. the mobo will support 9 sata ports. 
thanks again for your thoughts, they are always most helpful.
