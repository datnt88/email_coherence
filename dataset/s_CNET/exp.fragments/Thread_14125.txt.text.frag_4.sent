since the pc is going back and you may build your own. 
i offer that you look at &quot;bare bones or white box&quot; pc. basically, it's the pc case and what's inside only. the whole package depends on what's inside is already a match for what should work. 
you &quot;add&quot; the final items to complete the pc system. 
there is also just the mtrbd. 
and cpu setups for sale as well, you then finish it with the remaining items. 
again, the pairing of cpu and mtrbd. is good to go setup. 
sorry for your last pc, it happens.
