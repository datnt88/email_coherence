there's a huge amount of confusion over that mobo series and its support for pentium-d and core2duo. 
according to asus' website: &quot;p5nd2&quot; supports core2duo but requires pcb revision 2.00g &quot;p5nd2 se&quot; supports core2duo &quot;p5nd2-sli&quot; does not show core2duo as being supported &quot;p5nd2-sli deluxe&quot; does not show core2duo as being supported
