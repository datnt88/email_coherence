i want to replace my old router. 
my notebook (dell latitude d630) supports 802.11 b/g/n. 
my needs are simple: use the notebook to access my lan and the internet (cable modem to desktop). 
that's it. 
i want to take full advantage of the capabilities of the notebook's card, but i don't need the sun, the moon and the stars. 
i don't do gaming or watch films through the router. the max distance involved is probably less than 100 feet. 
i've noticed that user comments on cnet always rate routers lower than the cnet reviews, which isn't very helpful. 
i also want one that has better documentation and support than that provided by d-link.
