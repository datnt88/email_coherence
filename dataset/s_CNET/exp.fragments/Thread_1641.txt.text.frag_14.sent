if you can connect to the internet using your modem, try this.(if you are hacking someone else's network, this won't work) 1. open your web browser and make sure it's working.(then 
minimize it) 2. connect to the network, even if it gives you that message. 
3. get the network's default gateway on your wireless connection status.(it is under the support tab)if it doesn't say it, it is probably 192.168.1.1 4. type that into your browser's address bar to change your settings.
