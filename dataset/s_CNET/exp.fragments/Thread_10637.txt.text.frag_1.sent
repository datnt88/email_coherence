i am looking for a work horse printer that can handle a large monthly volume that prints full sheets of labels. 
when doing a search online for best label printers all the come up are specialty printers that only print single labels. 
i need a standard laser printer that will print 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheet labels. 
most office printers and all in ones claim that labels sheets do not work well, so i guess i need a specialized printer but can not find any. 
any suggestions and recommendations would be greatly appreciated, thank you!
