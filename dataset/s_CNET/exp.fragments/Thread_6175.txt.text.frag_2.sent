as long as you have your inf file in there specifying the refresh rates, there shouldn't be a problem with your monitor. 
you should open up your computer though and make sure your card is a pcie. 
and not only that, make sure your power supply has a 6 pin connector dedicated to the pcie card. 
if it doesn't, you're going to need a new power supply. 
and thats going to be a hassle to track down. 
otherwise, great card. 
great price too. 
a few of the reviews have it running at 64 degrees. 
that's pretty hot, but one guy said thats normal.
