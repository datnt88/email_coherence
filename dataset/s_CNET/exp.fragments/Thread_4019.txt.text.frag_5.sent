why not both? 
upping the old one to 2 gb of ram would be the only thing i would do with it. it would extend the life of it for a few more years until xp is no longer supported. 
as for a new system you can either build one, and it sounds like you could (if you don't already), or buy a pre-built system. 
now i don't know currency exchange rates very well, but i've put together an inexpensive system for around $500 us. 
over the years i've built several systems for friends, family and myself. 
my oldest system i keep for old games and other old programs. 
my xp system has become a media server, and my newest vista system is the one i use all the time for everything. 
another plus to a new system is that it should run cooler and use less energy.
