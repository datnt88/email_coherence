i used iklear, and moster lcd cleaners, but both left awful smudges and streaks. 
i later found out that they use polymers which do more harm than good. the shaggymac optimist prime lcd spray is the best laptop lcd cleaner i have used. 
when used with their microfiber it cannot be beat. 
even with my sony glossy xbrite screen, it leaves it perfectly clean. 
also the shaggymac laptop screen protector pads are awesome...a must have!
