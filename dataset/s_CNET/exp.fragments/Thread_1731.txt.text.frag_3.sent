i found it. the answer(s) to my question are in this very forum under the thread &quot;hard disk drives: is there a clear leader???&quot; (11/04/04) &lt; &gt;. the conventional wisdom of the thread's 47 posts seems to say seagate, maxtor, and western digital all both terrific and crappy at the same time. 
however, it does seem that maxtor was rapped more than lauded. 
western digital has almost equal supporters and detractors. 
little is said about seagate. 
however, if warranty is a reflection of the manufacturer's belief in its own product, then i guess seagate must know something the others don't with its recent 5 year warranty. 
yes? 
i guess it remains that &quot;you pay your money and you take your chances&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.
