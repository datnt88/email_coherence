it's a common issue, but many don't like that we have to scan and remove the pests with some 5 tools. 
some want a single piece of software to fix it. 
sorry, we don't have that technology yet (unless it's linux?) the short list is: adaware, spybot, cwshredder, housecall and bhodemon. 
bhodemon appeared a short while ago and i've found it usefull to list the bhos and to remove the ones i don't want. 
another issue is internet explorer. 
doxdesk explains it's danger. 
it's such an issue that i advise to use any other non-ie browser when possible.
