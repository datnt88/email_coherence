i do not know much about his computer specs sorry.... but the @ does not work, and it comes up as &quot;. 
he purchased another wireless keyboard with mouse and it is still with the same problem. 
the os is windows vista 64-bit with 250gb hard-drive, 4gb ram. is this a well known problem? 
i be so grateful if anyone who can sort this very annoying problem out for me....
