i am going to be building a new pc sometime this summer, and am looking at the q9450 with the hope of oc'ing to somewhere in the 3.3-3.5ghz 
range, using a noctua cooler. 
is this possible, and if so, how feasible (reasonable temps even on air cooling, stability, etc.), and what accompanying ram overclock is required? 
secondly, will ddr2-800 ram be sufficient (assuming i will have to oc it to at least somewhat)? 
(i saw ddr-800 here since i have seen a few discussions that seem to say that ram with stock speeds above 800 are sometimes unstable. 
any input is appreciated. 
if it matters, i will be using some flavor of asus p5q motherboard most likely.
