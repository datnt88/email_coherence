and it works very well. 
firewall problems appear to be nonexistent, speed is good, and now the only thing bothering me is that i have realized i may need a new range booster. 
it appears the belkin and the apple router are not able to boost each other on a single network. 
still, if anyone has any knowledge regarding some of the things i mentioned before, i'd be happy to hear them.
