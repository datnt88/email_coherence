i have two monitors. 
one is no more than two or three years old. 
it has started blinking off. the monitor is on but the screen goes black with a bright line going across once every few seconds. 
if i turn it off and on it comes back: sometimes for the rest of the day, sometimes for a few minutes. 
could it be dying already only after three years? the primary monitor is fine. 
can anyone help?
