at some point norton [no idea what version] reported an intrusion attempt. 
it is not clear to me exactly when the report occurred. 
i can't discuss it directly with the person whose computer had the report, as to what was being done at the time. 
he apparently has something going on in his life that causes him to suspect that omeone may e trying to hak into his omputer. 
my real inrest is whether such things as wake on lan etc can work in a laptop, thus the atx type power question. 
also thus i would advise him to unplug his satellite modem whenever he is not using the computer. 
i think that steven haninger answered me.
