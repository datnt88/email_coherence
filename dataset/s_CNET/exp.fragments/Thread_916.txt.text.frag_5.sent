ok, bob. 
i am prepared to embark on this new level of troubleshooting. 
i'll presume that something on the order of 10x magnification would show something i may recognize as abnormal. 
i'll further presume that i may end up using the machine w/ 256mb ram, but will advise if i make any progress...thanks again.
