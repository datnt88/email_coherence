hi! may i ask you to tell me, what you mean about &quot;check&quot;, where this trigger i`m can find at? 
i have the same problem and can`t solve it. 
my pc turn on by itself since i connected it to lan cable. 
before i was connect to internet via wi-fi. 
i checked all properties, everything about power (in bios and lan adapter) is now off. 
but it still turn on from sleep mode by itself(
