even if c: is getting full, the things that will take up room are large .exe 
files(setup files) , pictures, movies, music. 
what i don't understand is this, if c: is getting that full, you still don't need to copy the programs folder or documents folder to f:, just put new additions on f:. all you are doing is taking up room that doesn't need to be. when downloading , you don't have to have the folder called programs or documents to change it to f:. initially it sounds as if you are just copying c: to f:. do you have any back up options, like dvd or cd's to take a load off?
