out of the box, i've rarely found routers usable. 
it seems i have to update firmware, reset to factory settings and move on. 
i watch others pull it out of the box and flail about for months. 
&quot; also tried to download updated firmware but it didn't help - and rendered the router unusable. 
&quot; sorry to read that. 
at least it's returnable as a doa. 
hope you can recover.
