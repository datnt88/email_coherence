okay so i just got a new sound card from creative and put it into my lenovo motherboard via pci express and when i plug in my optical cable the light is on but when i plug it into my receiver, nothing i am trying to get 5.1 and on my computer when i set the optical to default it says it's outputting sound, i cannot get it to make any sound for the life of me. the analog works.
