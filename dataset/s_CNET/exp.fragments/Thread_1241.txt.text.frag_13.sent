well, it's jan 7, 2012, and i finally have the proprietary clearwire 4g hotspot &quot;apollo&quot; set up and working somewhat. 
for those who are clearwire isp users, giving wireless download speeds ranging from over 5000 kbps to under 800 kbps in the first 24 hours, with wpa and wpa2 mixed level, tkip/aes encryption of a 54mbps limited broadband g standard. 
at least it works for now and was priced between other two routers. 
have it connected on a speed cap removed monthly clear account. 
hp refunded linksys product in full. 
cradlepoint refunded two/thirds of purchase price of their unworkable router that they recommended via telephone support and that i had for 14 hours total. 
beware of the 3g store returns policy; it costs. 
have already encountered wireless speed drops due to tower congestion, but ces is headed our way this week. 
hopefully will get a video streaming capability out of all this. 
thanks, cnet and bob, for advice and trying to help!
