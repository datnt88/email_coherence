i tried the battery calibration, not sure if i did it right, but what i did was use up the battery until it was at 0%, then plugged in the adapter and tried charging it up to 100%. the problem is that after i tried charging it from 0 after plugging back in the adapter, it only got up to 2% and i left the computer on all day.
