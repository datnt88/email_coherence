the issue with the printer seems similar to what i experienced when i added my new laptop to my wireless network. 
it couldn't find the printer connected to the desktop even though sharing was enabled. 
finally, i just typed the printer's network path into the box in the ''install new printer'' wizard instead of trying to browse for it (ex: \dellepsonsty) and it worked. 
there were also a couple of other network resources i had to enter the path for instead of browsing. 
i have no idea why. 
this may have nothing to do with your problem, and i'm not awake enough to address the bigger network access issue, but it may prove useful to you or to someone following this post who has similar issues.
