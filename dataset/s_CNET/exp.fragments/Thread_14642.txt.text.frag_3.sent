you can get a x1300pro cheaper but for around the same price as the x700pro go for the x1600pro. 
the x1600pro is comparable to a 6600gt, if not better. 
my x1300pro plays call of duty 2, bf2, half-life 2, age of empires 3, and more on medium settings with no noticeable lag. the x1600pro will be even better with 12 pixel pipelines and a higher clock. 
however i'd buy this: $99 after $30 rebate. 
just look around at newegg.com and set yourself a budget and see what's the best deal.
