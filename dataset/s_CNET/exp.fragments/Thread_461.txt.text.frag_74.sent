i have an epson r220 and a r320. the same auto refill system will fit the r200, r220, r300, r320 and r340. 
they all take the same cartridges. 
follow the directions closly on installation, it can be tricky but worth the work. 
i use re-fillable cartridges in my r220 and a auto fill system in my r320. 
when the re-fillable cartridges in my r220 reach the end of their life, (yes everything has an end) i will replace them with an auto refill system. 
once you get set up and running, you'll never think about going back to cartridges. 
(manufacturer, or aftermarket)
