i've seen it mentioned before. 
seriously. 
i'm not looking for your view of it disapating. 
i'm looking for the process. 
working in a lab, it would disapate. 
in closed box - there is a process to release any build up. 
that's for bumping this up with answers, but i hope someone who remembers, notices this post.
