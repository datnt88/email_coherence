i am adding a second hard drive to keep some records on. 
the one i am adding has xp pro on it already and i want to wipe it clean. 
my main hd that i am using now also has xp pro on it. 
here is the problem i am having. 
i connected my main drive to the end of the cable and my slave drive to the middle part. 
when i boot up it ask which operating system i want to use and then begins to load the slave drive. 
i want it to load my main drive so i can get into the slave to reformat it. 
i have my jumpers set correct as for as i can tell. 
any ideas what i am doing wrong?
