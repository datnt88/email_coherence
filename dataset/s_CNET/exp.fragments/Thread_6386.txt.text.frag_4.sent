rubbing alcohol is kinder to electronics than anything water-based. 
when i worked for a paging service we would tell the doctors who always managed to drop their pagers in the toliet (and it happened at least once a week.) to immediately immerse the pager in rubbing alcohol, leave it there, and bring it in the next day. 
these pagers usually could be saved. 
this was back when an alpha pager was several hundred dollars....
