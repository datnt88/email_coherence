if it is wireless or not, the optical mouse some times have the same problem, even the laptop tracker. 
its because of 3 reasons. 
the first one is the mouse pad on which you move the mouse. 
some colors doesn't reflect the rays from the mouse. 
so if you move the mouse to the color where it can reflect it the mouse pointer jumps to it. 
second thing the mouse battery as well as the tracking of wireless receiver and your mouse. 
don't take the mouse to near the receiver and press the button to identify it. 
put the mouse in a place where you are going to use it and press the buttons at the bottom of the mouse and the receiver. 
third one is the driver. 
check the driver is correct.
