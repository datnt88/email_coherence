from past experience once you get into &quot;hodge-podge&quot; setups, sooner or later something happens. 
because it is some unique setup or arrangement, it becomes difficult to sort out. 
even for a pro, it boils down to get to the basics or lower level in order to settle things out. 
i think once you have this happen to you, it all makes sense what i'm stating. 
you will teach yourself what works and not. 
overall, i see you're trying to get the most out of it but placing some requirement and making everything else to conform or bend to it. 
you do what you gotta do, as others may offer, it is what it is and sometimes that's a build-up to a major failure. 
as i stated you it's not a good idea. 
i have no clue if you were on the www/internet you didn't state that. 
however, it is still possible should it become more open to your demands as time goes by at no fault of your own. 
it's just an issue i saw as possible given the info provided. 
good luck -----willy
