ok thanks for the suggestions....im still not sure of what to do....the 2 case suggestion is entirely to much for me....i really don't have the need for any more expansion besides a new hard drive....i don't want to get rid of my 60 gb hard drive because it stil has 35 gb free and works perfectly fine...i just wanted to add the new drive to store all my media files....but it looks like this is gonna end up being entirely to much work one way or the other
