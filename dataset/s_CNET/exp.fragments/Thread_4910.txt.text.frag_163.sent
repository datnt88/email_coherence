i have had this computer two years and it was taken back to best buy for repair because of the hourly shut down. 
i paid to have the video card removed and the problem started again. 
i did the shut down one minute before the hourly shut down and so far this problem is fixed. 
i am going to contact gateway and tell them how stupid it is not to tell people that this will fix the problem. 
i am going to update the bios as well, but this simple fix has solved my problem so far. 
thanks to all of the people on this thread for all of their idea and hard work.
