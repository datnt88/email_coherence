thanks bob. 
i will probably get a hauppauge. 
but still i still need to know if it can activate the close captioning or not. 
as you mentioned the hauppauge website, i went there but cannot find an answer for this from faq. in terms of the plug, i think it was my mistake. 
there is no difference between la and toronto, as a friend told me.
