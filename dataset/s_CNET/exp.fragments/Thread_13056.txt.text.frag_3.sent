under the bios, verify the setting is set to 'auto' to best handle cd or dvd drives. 
verify that the dvd is master/slave jumpered, same as old drive. 
if it presists, try another i/o cable. 
next, you can try doing a bios update as a last resort if the above doesn't work. 
if you seem to have problems burning if you get that far, make sure you sue good quality blank media.
