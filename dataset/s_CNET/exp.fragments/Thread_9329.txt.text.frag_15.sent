when we last discussed this you were looking for what i have never found in the land of computers (service, support par excellence and more.) the last i read you had found a local shop to do all you wanted. 
now i read about some gateway dying and moving to the mac. 
given your software was windows based and all your other requirements i find your move to a mac interesting.
