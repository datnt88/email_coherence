not to be picking on you but really, &quot;would you honor a warranty that's 1 yr. 
out of date&quot;? 
most companies would pretty much give you the same answer, no. if you like verify any warranty policy on the next lcd monitor and if offered see if an &quot;extended warranty&quot; is worth your time and possible added cost. 
good luck tada -----willy
