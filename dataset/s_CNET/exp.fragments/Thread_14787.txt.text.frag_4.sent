while i can write &quot;doesn't matter&quot; since at the end all that matters is the benchmarks, the truth be known that you can find that answer with google.com or ask.com. 
i could tell you that l1 cache is good because it's at zero wait states but that possibly will just create more questions. 
if you want to learn about cpu architecture then hit the web or take classes. 
if you want to know the fastest cpus then you just get the benchmark results. 
what's your goal here?
