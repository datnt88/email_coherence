you have an int. 
connection on the mtrbd. 
what does it look like? 
can you provide pix on the matter and be sure its usb as well. 
don't confuse any audio(spif) port for usb , they look similar. 
as i stated older mtrbds. 
weren't all std. 
and may differ which is why many usb harness had separate wires for a connection in order to match the needs. 
later usb connections followed the 10-pin connection(refer to previous post) and then try to connect. 
yeah, it maybe difficult but that's the way it is. 
it's very possible your pci usb int. 
connection is up to date and may follow the usb std. 
connection, use it instead of mtrbd. 
supplied for the time being. 
also, your usb reader has to be similar. 
if you're trying to carry over some emachine usb reader, it may not be a match or direct connection, because oem supplied parts are made for their wants and needs. 
this maybe a case of &quot;look and see&quot; what you have in order to resolve it. 
fyi- a mtrbd. 
connection is considered a &quot;hub&quot; or to a hub that normally supports 2-usb ports.
