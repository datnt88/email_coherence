hi, im looking to turn my old desktop pc into a dvr to record some tv shows and watch them through my tv i hate to miss. the problem is that im a poor collage student so i dont have the mega-bucks to spend on the project. 
im torn between the hauppauge wintv-150 and the ati tv wonder elite. 
i know that the ati card has a better picture than the 150 but i dont think my pc can handle it. the newest os i have to run on this machine is windows 2000 pro. 
my machine has a 1 ghz piii processor and as much ram as i can put in it. 
bottom line i just dont wont to waste money on something with poor resolution. 
i also welcome alternatives
