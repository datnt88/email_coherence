hi - i am assuming of course that you used your original windows xp cd to install onto the new hard drive - the reason that you would get your os 'seen on the h:drive' is quite possibly because you ran the installation whilst you had an external drive connected via usb to your computer during installation of windows or you had a usb stick or card reader connected - if you have an integrated card reader, please disable it from the bios first - if you have any drives or sticks connected to usb ports, these must be disconnected as well. 
only have the cd drive and hard drive connected when installing windows. 
but you still need to re-install windows if you don't wish to clone your original hard drive. 
a good cloning program is paragon drive copy - you can get a trial version of the internet - many computer magazines offer such programs in a cd/dvd off the shelf for less than 5 - that's also an option.
