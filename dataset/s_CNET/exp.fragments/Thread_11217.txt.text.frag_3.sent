the rich & famous? 
or regular people who are just barely trying to scrape by, ever since the world has become so runaway high-tech filled with ever more toxic junk from the east? 
even cnet (believe it or not) posted something about it: also see etoxics.org toxics in electronics: and why should something need to be overpriced just to be non-toxic? 
ditto for &quot;health foods&quot;. 
once upon a time, &quot;natural flavoring&quot; was par for the course at your local market. 
nowadays, natural flavoring is considered a health-food item. 
does that make sense? 
maybe to you (judging by your above post). 
not to me.
