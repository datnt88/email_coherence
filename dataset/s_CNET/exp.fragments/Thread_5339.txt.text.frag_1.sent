i have a hp 3-1 printer conected to my windows 98 pc via usb. 
my wife has a lap top with wifi. 
we currently are using a cable modem with a linksys wireless-g router for internet and voip. 
can i put a wireless print server on the printer so that we can share the printer and still have it hard wired through to my pc or would i then need a wifi card for my pc to use the printer. 
i'm new at this whole wireless thing. 
i understand if i had xp instead of windows 98 that i could share the pinter that way. 
any advise?
