why buy from this e-tailer when there are others out there with more competitive prices (e.g. newegg.com); 
from the list of components you have provided (although some are not available through newegg), there are far better choices/ prices provided by newegg second; do not scrimp on the psu, although ultra may be tigerdirects best (in-house) brand, for the same money you should be spending it on a more reputable company (e.g. antec, corsair, silverstone, and the like). 
third; while others may argue that &quot;all-in-one&quot; liquid cooling solutions (such as the corsair h50/ h70/ h80) are the next best thing to custom water cooling, they are not. 
these solutions are no better than a &quot;lesser&quot; priced air cooler. 
forth; while buying a computer case is strictly a personal choice only you can make, make sure the case you get fulfills all your needs...there's nothing worse than getting into the nitty-gritty of the build, only to find that the case you've chosen is more of a nightmare come true, rather than the dream you were wishing for. 
fifth; i have to agree with willy on the point of having an ssd, the point of having an ssd in your system is to make the o/s and other &quot;key&quot; programs run faster, rather than the &quot;old-school&quot; way of thinking, where the main hdd was for every program under the sun...then using other (internal or external) drives for storage and backup. 
best to have a smaller ssd for the o/s and a few programs that are used often; then get another &quot;fast&quot; drive for everything else.
