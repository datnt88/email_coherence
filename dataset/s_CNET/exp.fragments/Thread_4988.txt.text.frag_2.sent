a burner. 
wun 98 automatically installs the drivers for the cd-rom function. 
no need to tell it to install it. 
possibly you didn't watch the first boot after instsalling it where windows should have detected the new hardware and installed the drivers with no help from you. 
now i may be an idiot and the drive is a usb type, then forget what i said. 
simply telling us the model of the drive would mean we would have to search to find out if it was an internal or external drive. 
pleas include any of that special info in the intial post. 
do you have something connected to the usb bus???
