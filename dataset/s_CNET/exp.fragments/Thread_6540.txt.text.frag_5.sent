yes, i have a few lamp servers. 
but since web serving takes so little oomph we look for low watt systems. 
today my favorite are those 20 watt geode cpu's. the current web server at the office is drawing under 60 watts at peak use now. 
your goals are still unclear here. 
web site or building a pc? bob
