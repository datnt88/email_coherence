ok, we just got a network, and my dad is being difficult about it. 
he wants the router unplugged every night. 
he has a few reasons: 1. he's afraid anyone can access our computer. 
2. he's afraid it'll use up too much electricity 3. he's afraid it'll wear out too fast. 
so can someone please tell me that our router uses barely any electricity, wont wear out for years at least, and that nobody can access our computer, (especially since we haven't figured out how to yet.) thank you. 
its a linksy 802.11b router the network is between two computers. 
a desktop and a laptop. 
and i hate having to turn on the dumb desktop every morning just to get internet in my room. 
so please?
