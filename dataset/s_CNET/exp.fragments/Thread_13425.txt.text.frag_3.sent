the first thing to find out is whether or not the imac will start up from the restore cd/dvd you were not very specific about what happens when you attempt to start the imac. 
does it chime? 
does the screen light up? 
do you see the grey apple and spinning spokes? 
a folder icon with a question mark? 
does any happen at all? 
if the imac starts from the recovery cd/dvd, it is a good indication that most of the internal stuff is working as designed. 
the next thing is to find out if the hard drive is still functioning. 
if it is, then you have a good chance of recovering all your data. 
if it is not, then i'm afraid your data will only be recoverable using a professional data recovery service. 
if the imac booted from the cd/dvd, use the disk utility from the menu bar and see if it recognizes the hard drive. 
if it does, run first aid on it to see if it is damaged in any way. 
if it appears ok, quit disk utility. 
start the install process but choose archive and install as the installation method. 
choose only the archive and install option. 
you will find it under options at the first or second screen of the installer. 
this will lay down a new system folder, but will preserve all your data. 
once the recovery is complete, and the machine restarts, all your data will be where you left it. 
now make the backup of all your data! 
i will not beat the drum about regular backups, i guess you have already become a convert to that regime. 
daily backups are not too often. 
all the above relies on the hd being functional. 
pass on more information and we'll go from there good luck p
