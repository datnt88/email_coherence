as is, the limit is 3.0g (according the microsoft's docs.) but i'm not going to argue with you but note that another has done this and they were pissed at the results. 
they ended up with a 64 bit windows which was a royal pain to find all the drivers, they choice of antivirus, firewalls were not available in 64 bit and it was slower than they former core 2 duo with 2gb ram. 
so thousands later it was slower (in cs2.) other things were slamming (a good thing) such as video work. 
just trying to help you avoid a repeat.
