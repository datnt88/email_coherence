i have a p4 3.4 ghz, with 4gb ram ddr2, ati x700 256mb, with sata raptor 10k rpm. 
on which i use to run program for pic microchip emulator, to test programs that i make for pic processor. 
at that time i also had a p4 2.8, 1gb laptop. 
but one of the guys from my office walked up to me and asked me to exchange his laptop for mine, his was a brand new athlon 64, with 512mb but it had few other things like wireless and better looking screen, he wanted to exchange it because i had a serial port on mine. 
so i thought it was a good deal but not a great one, still i did exchange it, after installation i ran the same emulation program to my surprise the program actually was running 5-6 times faster. 
which is really amazing. 
btw if you want your machine to boot really fast don't install ms office, i use openoffice and it really boots up faster and works faster after being booted up.
