sorry, but one of our unwritten forum policies is to never help with homework or assignments. the 2 main reasons for that: 1. you learn much more if you do it yourself. 
2. your professor will get much better view of what you know and can (and what you don't know yet or can't do yet). 
so i'm locking this thread.
