i bought this adapter from radioshack called psx to usb adapter that lets you use a sony ps2 controller on your pc. the problem is whenever i plug the adapter in the rear port usb ports i keep getting an usb device not recognized. 
i installed the drivers before i plugged it in but that wont work. 
when i install the drivers, i go to the game controller properties and its not there. 
i then tried another game adapter and it worked. the adapter keeps making windows xp say usb device not recognized and a window shows something that says unknown device. 
i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that doesnt work. the adapter comes with a driver cd and i used that. 
i downloaded a driver from the radioshack site and it still doesnt do anything. 
sometimes when i plug it in it says found new hardware adn ready to use but nothing shows in the game controller properties. 
i used it before before i reinstalled xp due to a mobo replacement and it worked before. 
any help on this?
