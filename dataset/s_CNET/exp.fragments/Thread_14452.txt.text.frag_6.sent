i suggest you reload the mtrbd. 
drivers for usb if present. 
many times those drivers are keen to work better than ms os ones, even though they're part of the install. 
make sure in the bios they're &quot;active/enabled&quot;. 
finally, if none of this works, the power loss may have blown the usb ports, remember these ports are powered less than you think, .500ma/5vdc, 
so its a possiblity. 
if that proves right, install an usb card as a cure. 
good luck -----willy
