i really like hearing the feedback!!!! it's greatly appreciated to hear some good opinions!! so, i was just wondering since you said used to work, did you really have that many high performance machines at your store. 
i mean, the high performance machines coming out now, i believe but could easily be mistaken, are a fairly new thing. 
i would think that bb or cc would have sales on all of there stuff around the holiday season. 
thanks again in advance!
