your computer is quite old, it is barely worth spending money on a system that old, but, yes, you could definitely improve the sound dramatically by getting something like a soundblaster live with quad speakers and a subwoofer, the difference would be dramatic and pretty incredible if you bought good speakers. 
you can always use the speakers on a new system when you upgrade in the future. 
speakers like the cambridge soundworks run $100 or less for some pretty incredible quadraphonic sound.
