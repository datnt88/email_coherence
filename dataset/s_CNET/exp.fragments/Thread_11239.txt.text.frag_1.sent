i applied some thermal paste from radioshack on my cpu a week ago but then today i was switching the motherboard and i wanted to know cant i just take the heat sink off and just put it back on the new motherboard without reapplying it? 
i lost my thermal paste and i need to put my cpu in the new motherboard and i wanted to just move it without cleaning and reapplying. 
im not switching cpus, im just moving it.
