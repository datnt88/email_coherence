i have since resolved the dvd and cd burner drives not autoplaying, but i probably did it the hard way no thanks to this forum. 
i finally ended up reformating my hard drive and reinstalling windows xp. i noticed in my windows xp, in the device manager under ide ata/atapi controllers that the primary and secondary channels under my properties that xp was missing the advance settings tab which has dma settings for the drives. 
i have a asus p4pe motherboard which is a intel based. 
if i were you, i would try uninstalling the motherboard drivers and reinstalling them first. 
if that doesn't work, you may have to do it like i did. 
hope this helps you out.
