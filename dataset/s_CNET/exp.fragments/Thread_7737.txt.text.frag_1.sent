i'm going to build a media center pc and i bought the logitech harmony 880 universal remote [ ]. what is the best hdtv tv tuner card to use? 
i was told that i need to get a tv tuner card that comes with a remote and ir (infrared) receiver so that the harmony 880 is able to control the functions for the media center pc. could someone please suggest a good hdtv tuner card that you've used or know of. 
thank you
