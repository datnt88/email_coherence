it would be better to start a new topic. 
but i would say that your computer is having trouble shutting down some applications. 
go to your taskbar and start shutting down programs, usually by right-clicking and clicking exit. 
or press ctrl+alt+delete and go to the processes tab. then click user name to sort by the names. 
only shut down items under your user name, and use a little common sense. 
some one blamed a person who told them to shutdown everything and the person shut down winword.exe and lost his work. 
it's arguable, but i just want to tell you. 
make sure you save anything that is open. 
then try shutting down the computer.
