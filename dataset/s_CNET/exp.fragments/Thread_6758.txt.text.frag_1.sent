hey there. 
i`m trying to connect my mobile phone to my pc using a usb cable designed for the job. the set up for the cable and software says that it should be a usb connection, but when it looks for the phone, it only looks at com ports 1 and 2 (which i believe are the serial ports). 
how can i give my usb port a com number? is it even possible? 
i`m using windows xp pro. 
thanks in advance
