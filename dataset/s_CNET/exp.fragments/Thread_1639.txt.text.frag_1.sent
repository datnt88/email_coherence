i appologize if these questions seem trivial, but i have no experience with raid and i was not able to find the answers by searching. 
i have a 13&quot; macbook pro running osx snow leopard with a 250 gb internal hard drive. 
i have a 500 gb external wd my passport studio with two partitions, time machine and storage, which i connect using firewire 800. 
i keep all my large files on the storage partition, and do not have room to back these files up. the drive is almost full, and i am interested in setting up a 2 tb raid-1 configuration (2 x 2tb drives mirrored). 
i only connect my external hard drive periodically for time machine backups. 
if i need something from the external drive i just connect and transfer it when needed. 
i do not leave my hard drive connected most of the time. 
1. what is the difference between hardware raid and software raid? 
what is best for my application? 
2. should i use a single enclosure or two separate external hard drives? 
3. what is network attached storeage, and is it right for my application? 
(i only have an airport express router so i guess i would need to connect it using a hardwire ethernet cable) 4. can you please suggest specific hardware that i will need to accomplish your recommended solution? 
thank you all in advance, any advice you can give is appreciated even if you can not answer all of my questions.
