why not start with a socket 939 mobo and and 939 athlon 64? they're newer--you will have better upgrade options. 
you can get a nforce4 chipset, socket 939 board for the same price. 
also, you can get socket 939 athlon64 3000+ (w/hsf) for less than your barton. 
athlon64 939 3200+ for a little more.
