it seems so simple. 
we have that guest account which we rarely enable but that allows everyone to gain access. 
and the word &quot;anyone&quot; is anyone with an account, not &quot;everyone&quot; which would be those without an account. 
&quot;but i don't know how to set the permissions for another computer over the network.&quot; 
in short, windows doesn't do this! but we could add it in by installing openssh so one could stelnet into said 'server' and use the various net and other command line tools to adjust users and more.
