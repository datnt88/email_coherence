as per my initial question....&quot;what have others done and how has it worked?&quot; 
i am in the middle of setting up a couple of simple test environments right now one for solaris and one for suse. the problems i am going to run into with those are the machines i have them running on are not even close to the configurations of how they would be implemented, but i think it is a good place to start. 
so again, i have looked at ibm both servers and newer mainframe units, dell, hp, and sun servers for hardware. 
i have looked at solaris, suse, red hat and aix op systems. 
i can look at the specs and the features all day, but i would like to know what others have been successful - or not- with and some of their experiences.
