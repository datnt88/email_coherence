you said with the laptop plugged in, it says it's running on ac instead of saying it's charging the battery. 
i'm not seeing a problem. 
it is running on ac. as for the slower response while running on battery, this is normal. 
it's conserving power. 
one way is to slow or &quot;step down&quot; the cpu. 
you might find that you can customize some power settings to be less conservative. 
i'm not sure about sony but other laptops i've seen derive their power status displays from services that are running. 
it could well be that the battery isn't always charging. 
it won't need charging when full and not using it. 
are you finding problems being caused such as disconnecting the ac and finding the battery only 1/2 charged when it should be full?
