ignore my last post. 
i have been doing some reading, cable select requires a special cable right? 
since my old drive has no cs setting wouldn't i just set them as master and slave? 
would this cause any problems? 
i don't mean to sound like an idiot but it has been 8-10 years since i have done this! somewhere i read that because one is ntfs and the other fat32 there might be problems? 
thanks mike
