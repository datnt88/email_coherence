device manager to see if there's any evidence of usb port issues there. 
i've had usb port failures related to the southbridge component. 
what i was able to note physically was that it got uncomfortably hot to the touch. 
that shouldn't happen. 
it did seem to occur while either inserting or withdrawing a usb device. 
i decided to blame it on esd for lack of a better reason. 
i was able to buy an add in card to gain usb function but the mb failed entirely within the next couple of months. 
check device manager for usb problems.
