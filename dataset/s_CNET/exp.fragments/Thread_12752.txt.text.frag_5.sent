a miracle has been...i reset the parametres and bingo the security switch twigged reapplying the original data and .....oh......(settings) no the drive is still set at 100gb in computer management and 38gb in properties for the drive. 
oh well ! 
a big sigh of relief - intact from all that mess-next use a deleted partion finder to save time. 
a kick up ms bum for their untimely update..wpd sys volume driver...cnet as i expected better (i even wrote the fix asking you)....and ms answers who are still figureing it out- but when all is said and done i didnt get upset, i left an omen :last night when i was working on it ,gaddafi was killed.!.folks.
