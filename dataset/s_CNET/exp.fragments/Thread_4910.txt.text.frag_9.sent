and i saw that on a recent fun box i made. it had a mbtx board and the intel cooler. 
it would by design run the cpu fan at maximum on power up. 
since the board, bios, cooler and all were made by intel let's lay the issue at their feet. 
thankfully a new bios picked a not at maximum rpm setting on power up... bob
