try a new folder. 
stuffing many files into one folder is frankly, dangerous. 
even more on fat32 volumes. 
yes we can usually convert to ntfs with no loss but the moderators all know &quot;we only lose what we didn't backup.&quot; 
so before i go one step further, could you tell where the backup copies are?
