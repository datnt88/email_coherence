i am getting stuck on this and i hope someone out there can help. 
my desktop disk storage has gotten out of controll. 
at present i have two hard drives on the first ide channel and one hard drive and a dvd/r on the other. 
here is my delima. 
i want to eliminate two of the hard drives that do not contain the operating system and replace it with one large one. 
i want the other slot to become a second dvd/r drive. 
of the two drives i want to replace one has one partition on it and the other has three. 
i am thinking i can use ghost to make an image of all drives on a seperat external drive and then install the new large one and copy images to it. 
will that work? 
will i be able to keep current drive letter assignments? 
i am a little gun shy since i don't want to reinstall everything. 
thanks gary
