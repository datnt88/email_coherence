i would like to split the monitor signal from the computer (15 pin svga), with one going to a monitor that is hooked into a kvm switch, the other to an lcd t.v., which has a monitor capable input. 
i initially tried this with a monitor y cable, but the monitor behaved erratically, as if it wanted to turn on and off. the lcd t.v. looked normal, except it flashed some signal &quot;over size&quot; which i haven't yet investigated. 
would a video distribution amplifier, for a 15 pin monitor cable be available for sale? 
one input, with two outputs? 
i assume this would solve it.
