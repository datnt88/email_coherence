thanks for your reply. 
i was thinking load issues too which is why i bumped up to the 600 watt power supplies but the one that went out yesterday blew when my computer was in hibernate so i don't think that's it. 
i also looked at the bad caps info. 
i don't see any of that on my board and don't have any of the symptoms they give either. 
according to my motherboard and temp monitoring program my voltages and temps are all well within safe range. 
i am mystified. 
thanks for your help.
