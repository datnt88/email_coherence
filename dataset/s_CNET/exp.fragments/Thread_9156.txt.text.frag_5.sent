technical support... looks like they are there just to take your call and get your info instead of solving your problem. it was hard to believe you couldn't share a printer on a network using tcp/ip, because the very reason to be of this protocol is the possibility of sharing resources between different computers and platforms. 
that's why internet exists as we know it today. 
i finally was able to print to lexmark hooked at xp from my old pc using winme after some rather primitive procedure. 
i physically disconnected this lexmark printer from xp and hooked it up to an usb port at me, installing it like a local printer. 
i was able then to successfully finish with the lexmark wizard, install drivers and all. 
after removing this connection and hooking this printer back to xp, where it belongs, i opened this printer properties at me, and in details added a new port, located at \xplexmark (\serverprinter), and that made it! moral of this case: sometimes trust your instinct over technical support. 
thanks for your interest, jeyce
