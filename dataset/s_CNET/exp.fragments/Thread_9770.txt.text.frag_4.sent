since norton implemented this, my bet is some other antivirus will soon and trip over the same issue. 
you have to &quot;pitch in&quot; on this discussion and not only supply the &quot;we dont have norton...&quot;, but tell what you have. 
you can imagine we only have 20 questions to use and then i have to give up what you do have. 
please help the forum help you out. 
as to tweakui. 
please look it up on google.com and look at the drives tab to see if it's unchecked.
