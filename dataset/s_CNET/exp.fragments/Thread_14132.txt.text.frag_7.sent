i'll write it's doubtful you will find a person of an engineering background that will fix your monitor. 
if it has a defect, then you pack it up and return it. 
if you have a condition that needs some special consideration, then you work with your doctor to find a solution. 
your seeking of an electronics (crt) engineer is going to frustrate you since they will not understand the medical angles. 
wishing you the best luck, bob
