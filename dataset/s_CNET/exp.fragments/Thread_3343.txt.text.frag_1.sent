i plan to build a pc primarily for use in professional digital still photo editing. 
there are a number of graphic cards on the market geared towards gaming and 3d workstations. 
many of these are popular, such as nvidia 6800 and ati 800, but i don't know if they are technically suited to my purpose. 
i don't mind overkill however, i would like to at least have the minimum requirements covered. 
can you recommend a graphic card(s) to use for digital photo editing?
