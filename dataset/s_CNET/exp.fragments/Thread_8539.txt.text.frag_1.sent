i have been looking into new computers because mine died. 
i was considering getting a intel quad core computer then some one asked if i really needed that much power when most programs barely use more than a single core let alone a dual core. 
so i was thinking i should just go with a dual core chip with the best graphics card i can get. the things is i have been doing a lot of reading and i wanted to find out which of the dual cores are the best for intel and for amd. then from those chips which is considered the fastest and best for games movies and music. 
as a side note anyone have and good recommendation for a great website to build a computer to compare to dell and such. 
thanks as always.
