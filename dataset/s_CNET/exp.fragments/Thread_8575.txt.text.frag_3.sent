i am experiencing the same problem. 
i have an old netgear router (614) which is set up identically to the new one, but the new one doesn't work. the internet light continues to stay amber instead of green. the &quot;wizard&quot; insists on a static ip even though roadrunner insists it's dynamic. 
this new router's a pain since it requires an internet connection for troubleshooting. 
that's like having to start a car to find out why it won't start... i downloaded the firmware update, but now the power light is blinking green and amber as well as not having a good internet connection. 
if you know what the problem is, please let me know. 
thanks!
