since the epson support website and gte the drivers for w2k usage. 
this should resolve your problem if not w2k, try xp type only if no w2k drivers. 
post back with results. 
if the driver is presnt and all goes ok, but it seems still yet have another problem, try resetting the bios to spp from ecp mode but only after proper driver is installed.
