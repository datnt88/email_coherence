i have a sony computer with a windows xp operating system. 
i have a lexmark z52 printer which is giving me problems. 
lexmark has been very good and patiently walked me through everything in the book to get it working properly again including sending me a new cartridge, but without any success. the print-out is very poor quality, blurred in certain parts with certain letters distorted only when printing from the word processor. 
if i print from the internet (for instance if i printed out this page) the printer works fine. 
this makes me think that it is a microsoft word problem, could this be the cause and if so how do i fix it please?
