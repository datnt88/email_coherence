windows had released a driver update that somehow negated all of my usb ports once windows popped up. . 
. 
but i noticed that my keyboard worked as it was booting up before windows booted up, so i knew there was power going to it. 
you may have the same problem here. 
try reverting your computer back to before your most recent windows update, reboot and see if it works after that. 
if it doesn't, then sorry i wasted your time. . 
. 
but you could just always reinstall the windows update later :-d but that's what worked for me. . 
. 
windows screwed up the update somehow, and after i backtracked and restored the computer to before that update, it was fine. 
then windows searched for new updates, and that update was now taken off the list and replaced with another update that went through just fine. 
hopefully this will be your solution as well!
