alright ill mainly be using the laptop as basically a desktop replacemen, main apps ill be running are a word processor, power point,and a spread sheet program.i 
will also us it for heavy music and video downloading, and some light photo editing. 
i will be running most of these apps at the same time, and thats why i want a laptop that can run multiple apps at the same time smoothly. 
i kinda perfer the mac because of its limited virus vulernabilities. 
if you guys could make another recommendation as to a macbook, or another spefic laptop would be very helpful.
