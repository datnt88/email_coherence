i think you may have a virus/spyware, as you suggested. 
try looking at your process list to see if you have any unnecessary processes running. 
if you press-and-hold ctrl, then shift, then delete, the task manager will open. 
next, click the &quot;processes&quot; tab, and click on the &quot;name&quot; button. 
this will alphabatize them, which sometimes helps. 
go to... ... this site for help on what processes are needed and what ones are not. 
once you have closed several processes that are unneeded, your computer will probably speed up some. 
also, it might be good if you go into the options menu, select &quot;hide when minimized,&quot; and then minimize it. the little performance icon will sit in your tray, and you can monitor when your computer gets slower, because you will see more green bars lit. 
if your mouse freezes up, and the box is completely green, you know that it is freezing up because of your computer being slow. 
hope this helps... hasta luego!
