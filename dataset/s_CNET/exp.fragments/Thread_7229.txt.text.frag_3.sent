system, the number of fans, their location, the direction that they push air. 
you should be able to do 10 c degrees better with very little effort. 
they have a temp sensor diode that provides an output to the mobo. 
if the mobo has the protective circuit on it, it will shut the system down. 
better check on the mobo. 
silicon melts above 1000c, transistor action still occurs above 200 c, however the other components of the cpu structure will burst into flame well below that. 
lol the cpu could possibly run at 90 c for years [if the circuit didn't shut it down], however let's not push it. 
get the temp down a minimum of 5 c, try for 15.
