well this old plextor has a program called audio capture that is just so easy. 
i still have it running in a win 98 machine. 
no muss, no fuss. 
i miss it. 
with these new programs, i always forget which of the 200 buttons does the one thing i want. 
i actually have to write little notes to myself to remind me how to do some simple task that took an hour of digging around in menus to find. 
i can't decipher the program that came with my creative sound card.
