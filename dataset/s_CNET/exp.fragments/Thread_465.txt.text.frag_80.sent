i have a dell dimension 8100, p4,1.3 ghz., 60 gig hd, beautiful 19&quot; monitor. 
it came with windows me(horrible), and 128 mb of memory. 
i added xp and more memory(512 mb). 
oh, it also came with a modem because i had dial-up access at first. 
i keep it clean and tuned up and it serves me well.
