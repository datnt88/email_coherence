&quot;dead pc. no power when i turn it on.&quot; 
last night i was installing my new 160gb western digital hard drive. 
well, i didn't think i was gonna have any problems. 
at least not hardware problems. 
after i screwed it in, i set the jumpers to the propers pins (on both hard drives), i put the ide(?) cable in. 
old hd is set to master, new hd is set to slave. 
i plugged power cords into each hd. 
then, i closed up the case, plugged it back in, and turned the button on to power it up. 
nothing! 
absolutely nothing. 
huh? 
i opened it up again, and tried powering it up while i looked in there. 
when i clicked the power on the fan turned for a second, then quit... but nothing else. 
does anyone know... is my cpu fried? 
i don't think even poor hard drive installation would cause that. 
it should at least power up. 
right? 
any help? 
cheers.
