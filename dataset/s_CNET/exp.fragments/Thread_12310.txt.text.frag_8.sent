shows fixes in sp2 that some don't know about. 
frankly this is starting to sound like an owner that didn't try the &quot;as delivered&quot; router settings (i start there and with the only settings needed by the isp). 
after i see if work i move to secure the network. 
there are also those pests and p2p issues. 
i can't help most p2p users since they can't kick the habit but pests often hijack the windows tcpip stack. 
for that we scan with ewido, housecall, rootkit revealer then once the pests are gone i run winsockfixxp from bob
