taking out battery, unplugging & holding down power button. 
so what causes mouse to jump once in a while, or insert to toggle on it's own? 
i'm doing it because i'm desperate to find ways to reduce something coming from the unit since repair that's hurting my ears. 
can't hear it, but original problem was the now famous buzz (the rmclock did get rid of it). 
wish i'd known about that before sending it in. 
because now something is wrong with the new fan. 
1. it's blowing cold. 
i've changed to older bios so it isn't always on but it's still blowing downright cold air. 
2. some buzz or aspect is causing ear pain. 
i don't need to develop tinnis from a laptop. 
so figured removing static couldn't hurt - specially since mouse & insert's been a problem since got it back from hp.
