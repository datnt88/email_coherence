please tell me where in the sticky it explains how to get the xbox live to work while securing the dlink router. 
i see it says mac filtering is a joke, and wep isnt very much better. 
how to i add the ip address of all four of my systems to a safe zone so i can lock out everyone else? 
i cannot figure out how to add my 3 computers into the firewall rules list--funny the xbox ip is already listed. 
i read di-links instuctions on setting up the di-524 firewall but they did not include much details and i got lost, for example, what do i chose for my destination? 
what are my port numbers? 
the tcp ports seem to be 1033-51652 but that doesnt sound right. 
i need to be walked through the steps as i just cannot get it. 
thank you
