i write apps so to me i hide the fact my apps read external memory cards into local memory as needed and makes it all seem like magic. 
any decent app (for example the player) would just deal with it. 
i've found the purveyors of these tablets to be unknowing and i can't collect all of them. 
at the office we write apps for such things but even there, we only have a dozen or more models. 
this is not one of them so i can't test for your issue.
