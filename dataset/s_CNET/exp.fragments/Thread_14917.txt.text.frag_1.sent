hello, i am wanting to upgrade my video card from a nvidia 8300 gs 128 mb to a card that is good enough to play half-life 2 episode 2 and above. 
left4dead2 demo did not play that well either. 
i have a 300 watt power supply, and some claim that the radeon 4650 , and 4670 will work? 
i have had others claim that i need to get a (uhm.. crappy) 8500 gt nvidia ? 
then there are others that say i need to upgrade my power supply before i even think about getting any upgrades? 
any more ideas?
