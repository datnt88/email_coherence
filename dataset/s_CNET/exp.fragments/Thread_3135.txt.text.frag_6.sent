did you set the first display in the bios to pci card ? 
this thells the motherboard that you have a card in instead of the onboard graphics. 
i have the same board from mach speed at tiger direct and it works just fine. 
tests as the fastest with fresh devices cpu benchmarks i am running a intel celeron d 3.33 gh and this board flies, can't wait to try a dual core in it
