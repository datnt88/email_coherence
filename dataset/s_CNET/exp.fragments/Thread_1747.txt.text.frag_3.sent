first, if you have a usb type kybd., forget it, get a older ps/2 type in order for the kybd. 
to be active. 
next, visit the hp support website and naviagte to your model's details on entering the bios. 
you can try f2, but f1, or f10 are good canditdates as well as any other &quot;oem determined&quot; key, just the way it is. 
even within the hp models, whats used on one model may not be used on another model, but the model series, may.
