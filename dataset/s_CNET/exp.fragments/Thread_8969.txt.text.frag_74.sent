ive had viruses, unkown problems, booting problems, problems logging on, problems randomly in windows, one time a linux instalation froze and messed up both partitions of one hard drive so i had to use another computer to download a new version of linux on a cd then install limewire and download mce and convince a guy from microsoft that i actauly bought a computer with mce on it lol(they dont sell mce cds) ive had my pc slow down so much and virus scans never made it vaster (since when does a core 2 duo e6600 oced to 2.7 ghz get slower then a pentium d =o) im not the best with software ever and most of my problems unfixable i just reinstall windows. 
ive tried vista but its horrible for gaming. 
building a pc is so much easier than figuring out a problem with software =( but yea id say ive reinstalled different oses on my pc of just winows at least 20 times =p im lucky i have stuck about 3 mounths without any problems so im good i guess my new antivirus works mcaffe&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;norton ^^
