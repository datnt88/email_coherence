sorry, i thought everyone would automatically assume that i've installed the drivers. 
well, i have already installed the drivers and everything in the device manager is fine. 
i downloaded sis video, sis agp gart, sis ide, and sis nic drivers. 
that pretty much covers the sis 650 northbridge/ sis 962l southbridge chipset drivers. 
so what could be the culprit?
