your card reader maybe a usb hub and will keep the icon on. 
if you have a sata hard drive. 
the windows os reads sata drives as a usb drive. 
i have two sata drives and i had the same thing you are having. 
right click on the icon and a popup window will tell you what is keeping the icon on. 
in your post &quot; i uninstalled then disconncted it (card reader). 
on reboot the icon had gone. 
reconnected the reader and icon reappeared.&quot; 
i think your reader is a usb hub.
