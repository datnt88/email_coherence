i was able to get to router (linksys) site but it wants a username and password and what i had wrote down won't work. 
i tried to use admin as both and even as just password but still won't work. the only way i can get internet access is to have my cablem modem going to the computer. 
i did what you suggested by going to command then ipconfig and was able to get the address that i needed. 
do you have any other suggestions? 
i'm at a loss as to why the router won't work with my cable modem. 
thanks again, renee
