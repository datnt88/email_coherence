but check the old adapters to see what they were rated at. 
i do know these can burn out if the old laptop battery is less than stellar. the only thing i am religious about is to never move the laptop with the power plug in. 
i've repaired more than my fair share (other peoples). 
it's a lesson i learned by others making that mistake.
