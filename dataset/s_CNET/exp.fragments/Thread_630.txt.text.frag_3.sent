thanks for the advice, i looked at the 7300's and never thought about them being a temp solution. 
once i upgrade his card, i can install the 7300 in my computer and give it a little tweek. 
of course being in canada i can't buy from newegg, they don't ship up here. 
but i did find one locally for only a couple of dollars more than the listed price on newegg. 
next i have to actually build this thing...
