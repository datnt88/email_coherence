harley2ride: i would like a vm but they are kind of pricey. 
those new athlon units by dell seem to be selling low but your reference to a minimal ps of 400 watts; i agree on that; dell's ps's in those new athlon units are probably no more than 350 watts. 
for my basic needs could i get by with 350 watts or not? 
have you ever heard of anyone buying a new dell and upgrading the computer's ps or would doing such cause problems for the computer?
