given the problems with trying to use wine / crossover office, vmware, bochs and other non-solutions, is there hardware that can simulate two pcs, allowing one to load two operating systems and comfigure how much memory to allocate to each os perhaps in cmos / bios if in the motherboard or by a windows, dos, or linux program otherwise? 
there are a few concerns of mine here. 
there are bound to be some device-related issues here. 
perhaps have some devices accessable by only one os at a time such as sound cards. 
i am not so sure this is appropriate /workable for displays. 
another real concern would be bus mastering devices. 
the only search terms and phrases i can think of lead to irrelevant results.
