sun has just announced that they have sold the core technology that underpins their mainframe rehosting business to chicago's clerity solutions inc. 
so now mtp amd mbm have another new home. 
see &quot;still looking to cut costs, struggling server maker sun microsystems inc. 
has sold off its mainframe re-hosting business to chicago's clerity solutions&quot; this set of products has had a chequered history - starting life as unikix and then had a numbers of owners - first it was unikix in the early 1990s then came peerlogic then critical path then sun bought it in around 2002 and now clerity in 2006. 
so if you are planning that your current mainframe applications run on sun's mtp/mbm product set for the next 10-20 years then maybe you should now be cautious?
