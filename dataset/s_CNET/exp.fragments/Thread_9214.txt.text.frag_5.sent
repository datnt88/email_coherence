bob, thanks for the suggestions. 
unfortunately, none of these issues is of concern (they have all already been addressed). 
since it is only this one computer that is inaccessible at times, i lean towards something having changed on it - like a windows update or zonealarm update which is aggravating things. 
pain in the butt.
