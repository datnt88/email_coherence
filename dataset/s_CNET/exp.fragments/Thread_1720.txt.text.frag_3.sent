i agree, hence why so many of these business are collapsing. 
i just feel that there are enough enthusiast out there to keep the pc alive. 
while the facebook stalkers and the news readers love the ease and convenience of tablets and phones. 
i do think that there is a nitch for those who want to see there windows score at 7.9, boot in 8 seconds, stare at there 4 monitors, and fill there 8 terabytes that you can never max out with a pc. also, it is hard to play the new call of duty that is coming out on a tablet. 
lastly the though i have sold hundreds of laptops and tablets to elementary schools for 7 year olds all the way up to universities, i feel that the computer lab needs to stick around as well as the desktops in business. the better way to put this, is though i know desktops are diminishing, i do not see them going away. 
with this being said is there a place for custom whitebox builders or are we going to throw in the towel to dell, hp, and lenovo. 
because frankly they are often not competitive, they use the same parts, does the name dell really make people feel that warm and cozy
