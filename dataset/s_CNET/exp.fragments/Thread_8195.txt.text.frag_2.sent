the new drivers (you did download and install the new drivers?) may work differently and as such you now get to try the scanner on windows 98. this is an annoyance to some that some devices don't work in xp. in closing, the xp install could be incomplete. 
many are unaware that microsoft does not install motherboard, usb and many other drivers for them. the os installer (you?) gets to do that.
