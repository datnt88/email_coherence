a kick that dents a pc case isn't a small one and opening a hard drive to troubleshoot it is an almost certain kiss of death. 
i'd say to evaluate the damage and see what's salvageable you'd need to do such one component at a time using another pc to test them. 
i doubt you're clicking hard drives are going to be recognizable on any pc, however. 
there are data recovery services available. 
i can't say how much they charge but it may be more then the cost of an entire pc and with no guarantee of complete success.
