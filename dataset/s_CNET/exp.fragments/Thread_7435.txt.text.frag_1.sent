i have been burning movies for the past few months without complications. 
however, up until recently, using the same method i have always used, the dvd's no longer work. the program goes through the process of converting and burning, but the dvd can't be read by the computer or dvd player. 
i just recently had a virus, adware.look2me, 
which is removed now. 
could that have had something to do with it? 
ive tried re-installing the dvd-rom drivers and my converting/burning program but no luck. 
here's what i am using. 
comstar 16x double layer internal dvd+/-r rewriter winavi video converter someone, please help thanks
