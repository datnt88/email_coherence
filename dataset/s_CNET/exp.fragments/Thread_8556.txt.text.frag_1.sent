last night i installed a brand new western digital hard drive into my wife's pc. i partitioned it and set it up so window's sees it. 
problem is, now the system keeps crashing every so often....it will either crash a game being played or completely shut down the computer. 
the one thing that i noticed right off the bat was that the main hard drive is set to master and this new drive is set to secondary master, but after the computer started up i figured it must be ok. that's the only conflict i can think of that might be screwing things up. 
any ideas on why it might be crashing? 
thanks!! amd 3.0 sound blaster audigy two different hard drives windows xp home
