i had a cd with all my drivers and after a reformat i just had to click on to reinstall drivers i did that this time it installed 3 out of 5. the 2 it missed were ' other pci bridge device and sm bus controller'.is 
there a tool or something i can use to find these 2 drivers thats not to complicated.
