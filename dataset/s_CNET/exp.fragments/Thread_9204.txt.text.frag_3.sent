here are the choices from newegg... slim pickings. 
i don't recommend paying for obsolete technology (agp) if you have a choice. 
even if your old agp card is a quadro, you should really consider getting a pci-express based motherboad. 
agp cards are typically more expensive than their pci-e counterparts and there are fewer choices (and those choices are only going to shrink). 
if the card is more than 3 years old, you can probably get a faster pci-express card for less than $150.
