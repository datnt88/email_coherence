not your exact card but i installed the following replaced a this with that and here's the watt readings of the entire pc before and after. 
said pc is a common core 2 duo, 2gb ram, single hd, single dvdrw. 
before: nvidia fx5700 256mb agp 8x = 105 watts running doom after: ati hd 3650 512 agp 8x = 135 watts running doom if your machine taps as much as mine that 305 dell watt psu should be fine with this type card.
