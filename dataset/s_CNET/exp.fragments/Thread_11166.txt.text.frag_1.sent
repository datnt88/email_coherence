i have problems connecting my printer to my laptop. the other day i had to buy a new laptop as my old one had died on me. 
i have a network with 2 pc's and 1 laptop. 
1 pc is used as a server for data and printing. 
this is a 32 bit vista machine. 
i have a canon ip4200 printer hooked on the pc. my new 64 bit laptop runs windows7 home primium sp1. 
so up untill now connecting my laptop/pc to the printer has allways been a piece of cake. 
but unfortunately with my new laptop it won't work. 
here's what goes: 1) configuration =&gt; printers 2) add a printer =&gt; networkprinter 3) it surches my network and yes it finds a printer connected to my pc. it's adress: \pc_boven_02canon ip4200 4) click next and it starts connecting to the above mentioned printer. 
5) after a while a screen pops up: no driver has been found! 
click ok to manually surch for the driver. 
so i click ok 6) i enter as a path: c:windowsinf (suggested by canon when i contacted them). 
7) i get back on step 6 no drivers. 
i asked cannon and they say they do not have a seperate driver. 
when i connect the printer through usb it automatically connects. 
no sweat. 
cannon doesn't seem to have the answer. 
who does?? (i used to have a 32bit windows 7 laptop and that worked well.)
