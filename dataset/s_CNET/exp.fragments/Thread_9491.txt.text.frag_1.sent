is there any way to burn vcr tapes to my pc? my son (now deceased) was assistant athetic trainer for the alabama crimson tide from 1979-199. 
i have vcr tapes for every televised crimson tide game from 1985-1990. 
i want to heep them in a better format, and perhaps to edit and burn them to dvd-rw disks. 
thanks, ed henne
