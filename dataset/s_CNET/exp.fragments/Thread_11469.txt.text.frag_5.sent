i'm not sure i understand what you meant about missing the result of the article. 
i pulled up the link and didn't see anything about how to make dvd burners region free. 
anyway, i am looking to purchase the dvd burner on the internet, so i was wondering if anyone knew of some place on line that sells region free dvd's that would fit in that case i posted earlier, or at least a dvd burner that can be made to be region free either via a firmware upgrade or some code that can be entered.
