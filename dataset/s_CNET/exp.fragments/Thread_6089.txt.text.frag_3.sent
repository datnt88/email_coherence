zip drives aren't that good once they get into old age. 
if you have used older zip disks and found them to be failing, they've reached the end of the line. 
further, a bad zip disk can effect other good disks as the wear&tear on the drive itself could be at at fault -or- become faulty due to bad disks. 
once, you experience a bad disk, save whatever data and try to another one, swap data. 
overall, i don't recommend zip drives unless you got to have them. 
they have fallen out of favor with users due to this.
