hi, i hope this is in the right section i recently upgraded my amd socket 939 mobo from an athlon 3500 and radeon x1650pro to a dual core amd 4200 with a thermaltake blue orb2 fan and radeon x1950pro. 
i also installed a fresh copy of my windows xp home and it's fully updated (this was a few days after i installed the new stuff, hoping it would fix the problem). 
problem: the old system ran fine, no crashes whatsoever. 
after i installed the new components and installed the catalyst 7.10 &quot;driver only&quot; on the system, it would just randomly crash (with the old xp). 
whether is be trying to install software, playing a game, looking at pictures and videos or browsing the net. 
so i then installed a fresh windows and the catalyst 8.2 control centre and driver, which is what i'm using now. 
it has fixed it to some degree, so i can now play games and install stuff. 
but on a random website or trying to save a random picture or even watching a youtube video, it will either freeze or the monitor will turn off or it will say &quot;out of range&quot; and then restart. 
it is a clean install of windows, 2 weeks old. 
and the bios settings are exactly the same as with the x1650 which worked fine. 
i know it may be a stability issue or a setting i must change in the bios, but i have no idea what the problem actually is. 
my system is as follows: asus a8v deluxe m/b, agp 8x, socket 939, bios 1017 (latest) amd athlon x2 4200+ ati radeon x1950pro windows xp home sp2 fully updated 750watt tt psu i would really appreciate any help. 
games fly, but i surf the net just waiting for it to crash. 
i'm lucky i could write this message! 
thanks ps. i was just about to press submit post and guess what it did... this time it said &quot;non-preset mode&quot; and just froze. 
thank goodness for firefox's restore
