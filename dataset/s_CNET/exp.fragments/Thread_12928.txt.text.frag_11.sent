you have an issue that can have at least 2 possible causes. 
if the caps(round, cylinder-like pieces)on the motherboard look ok(no bulging or crusting)then personally i would replace the psu. 
you should replace the psu anyways because it is light on power as bob has noted. 
am i getting through now? 
good luck!
