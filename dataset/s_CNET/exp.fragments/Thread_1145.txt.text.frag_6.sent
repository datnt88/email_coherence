ouch. expert setup mode. 
ok, without knowing the setup in detail i'll just write it shouldn't work. 
not everyone gets it right. 
also, any use of ics trumps the sharing and may disable this. 
i'm also sensing this is some homebuilt machine. 
again the details are missing so i can't guess if you forgot some motherboard driver.
