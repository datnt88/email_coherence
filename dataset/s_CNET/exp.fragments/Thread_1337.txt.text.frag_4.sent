ink cartridge prices are the biggest con job since bottled water. 
the manufacturers could give the printers away for free and cut the prices they charge for ink cartridges by 50% and we would still be ripped-off. 
i print as little as possible. the worst of the bunch is hewlett packard who charges more than its competitors. 
the end product looks good but we pay through the nose.
