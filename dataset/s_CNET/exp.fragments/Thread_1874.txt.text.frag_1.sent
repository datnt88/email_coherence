i have recently aquired a micronpc piii mb (mbd00-1136). the mnual at buympc's website does not have the front panel lights/switch positions listed. 
i get the mb to power on, but when i try to install any windows(98,me or xp), it will restart during install, usually at the same place. 
this is not an overheating problem, as i can let the mb run diags for hours with no problems. 
i believe the problem to be the fp switch connections on the mb. does anyone know the proper switch positions for this mb or where i can find a more complete manual for it. 
all help is greatly appreciated.
