i just bought a geforce 8600gt graphics card so that i can play some games, as my current graphics card was too bad to support the games i wanted to play, and someone recommended the 8600gt to me as a graphics card. 
can somebody please tell me how to connect graphic card to my pc ? 
and whether or not i will need to get some other things to connect it, like a cable or something ?
