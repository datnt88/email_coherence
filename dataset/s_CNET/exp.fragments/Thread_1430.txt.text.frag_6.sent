and other searches don't reveal much. 
i can't tell what that means given so little a story from you about what you used to get that error. 
i'm also unsure if you used cdburnerxp and tried it with new media at 1/2 the rated speed. 
also suspect is the drive's firmware (never revealed) and if you used a cd/dvd lens cleaner. the lack of details leaves me with little traction on this one.
