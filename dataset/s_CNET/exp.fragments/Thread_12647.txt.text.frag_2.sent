i am in the same market, but my own experience can tell you one thing. 
fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads do not buy lexmark printers ***. the color quality is sub-par at best, the inkjet cartridges are tiny (300 prints max per cartridge) and most printouts have a faded appearance, no matter how hard you &quot;tweak&quot; the printer settings. 
that's why they literally throw these printers at your when you buy pc's from any bigbox store. 
so, anyone else got advice???
