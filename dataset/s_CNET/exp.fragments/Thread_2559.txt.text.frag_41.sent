very nice for the price, amd sempron 1.8ghz, 100gb hard drive, cd-rw/dvd-rom optical drive, ati radeon xpress 200 on board graphics, windows xp home edition with service pack 2, 512mb ddr sdram. 
i usualy hate buying retail computers (i just build my own for half the price) but that is a great deal for what its got in it.
