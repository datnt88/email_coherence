my colleague bought a kingston 512mb extended memory to install on his ibook. 
the ibook detected the memory, and updated the total ram as 768mb (512 + 256). 
everything seems alright, but after working for a very short while, the ibook will stop responding. 
he restarts the ibook, and after a while, the machine &quot;hang&quot; again. 
if he removes the 512 memory, the machine will work fine. 
could this be the problem of the ram? 
or what other reasons can there be?
