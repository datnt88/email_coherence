hope someone can help.. here is what i have windowsxp pro 2 gig memory msi motherboard intell pentium 4 1.) hard drive 200 gig with 2 partitions master (ide cable) (lets say c and d for lack of any other way to explain.) and not counting the cd drive as a &quot;partition&quot; but it is e on the &quot;cable&quot;(ide cable) select. 
i didnt know if the cd would be counted as a partition, so if you count the cd as a partition would be 3 partitions. 
2.) hard drive 320 gig with 4 partions master (ide cable) f,g,h,i and not counting a cd drive as a &quot;partition&quot; but is the j on the cable (ide cable) select. 
i didnt know if the cd would be counted as a partition so if you count the cd as a partition would be 5 partitions. 
the reason i did this.. wanted to take everything off the 200 gig and wipe fresh. 
wanted to have the 320 gig like f for operating system g for zipped and unzipped stuff h for music and i for swap (memory?) and after cleaning the 200 gig completely format/partition for extra storage or maybe dual boot (different operating system) this is what i am wanting.. 1 hard drive 200 gig with 2 partitions(master) and cd drive as slave 2 hard drive 320 gig with 4 partitions(master) and cd drive as slave when i boot up with the partition table boot disk.. i get the message.. partition 1 and partition 2 on hard disk 1 overlapping. 
i have searched everywhere only to find nothing. 
i need a soloution to this error. 
only answer i can find is to wipe the drive. 
how do i fix this without loosing my stuff? 
hope i explained this so someone can understand. 
thanks in advance!
