hi, 256 ram, 64 vid card 20gb hd win xp pro. 
p 1.4ghz (intel) a couple of days ago i got a system error message during xp's startup. 
it told me to proceed. 
i clicked yes, and it looked like it entered safe mode (4 bit, 640 x 480). 
there were no messages. 
i reset the color setting to normal and reboot. 
xp loaded but said win xp encoutnered a serious error. 
but everything seemed normal except for my wallpaper that had patterns as if it were in &quot;halftone.&quot; 
(the problem went away when i reapplied the wallpaper.) i ran the usual aps, checked for viruses and spyware, none found. 
today i was using ie, msn messenger and windows media player when i heard a beep sound and everything froze for about a minute. 
then the screen went black for a few second then went into safe mode with the low res colors. 
an error message said there had been a device failure and that i should save my work. 
i restarted the computer and it was fine. 
i just replaced my monitor a few days before any of these happened. 
i also notice a loud sound and light coming from my floppy disk drive after it is used, as if the computer is still reading it. 
could it be a hard disk faailure? 
but shouldn't there be an error message about it? 
with win98 i could tell when the hd was conking out because it always ran a scandisk at the start. 
could it be the video card? 
thanks,
