p.s. hdd prices are through the roof right now... if you're building this now, i'd use an old one if i had a spare. 
they're expected to go back down sometime. 
that 500gb you've got is $110. 
last august i got a 1tb for $44. but if you do here's a 5800 rpm 1.5tb hdd for 10 bucks less: imo it'd be dumb to take the slightly higher read/write speed over 1000 more gb.
