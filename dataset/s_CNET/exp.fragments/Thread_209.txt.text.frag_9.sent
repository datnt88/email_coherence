assuming that your windows 95 pc doesn't have a cd-burner and doesn't support usb-sticks, your options are limited: 1. use floppy. 
2. get the hard disk out, put it in an external enclosure, connect that to your xp-machine or laptop and copy all you need from it. 
you are very lucky that such an old windows 95 computer still works and you didn't yet loose your documents.
