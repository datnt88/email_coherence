let me write it this way, whenever i try to put the graphics card in the agp slot and try to restart the pc. it just not responds. 
i can't go the bios, windows or anything if i have this card inserted. 
as soon as i put the card out, it auto. 
goes to onboard graphics and works abs. 
fine. 
i tried switching the graphics. 
the only thing i can do in video config. 
is select agp/pci, frame buffer and aperature size. 
i switched between agp/pci, failed!. i cleared cmos, nothing again. the card was working tremendous yesterday. 
what that suggests? 
graphics card has gone bad?
