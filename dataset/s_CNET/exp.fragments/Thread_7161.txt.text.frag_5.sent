hello, we are going to need some basic information. the first place to start is what motherboard do you have? 
take the side off the case & look for a make & model on the motherboard. 
it will be something like asus a7n8x. 
next, with the side off, start the computer & look at all the fans. 
are they all spinning? 
are they clear? 
not all clogged up with dust? the main fans to look at are the cpu fan & the power supply fan. 
note everything & give us as many details as possible.
