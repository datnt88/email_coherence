the latest fdisk?? the one that supports that size drive??? if you did, when you formatted it did it say that it was formatting the correct amount??? my experience with the new fdisk is that when formatting, it shows the incorrect amount on the format screen, it shows the incorrect numbers and off by one decimal place number of digits, although when done, it has properly formatted the drive. 
seems that ms didn't update format after coming out with the new fdisk. 
i have no idea if, not using the latest fdisk could cause your problem. 
simply downloading the latest fdisk, does not place it on a newly created bootdisk. 
that must be done manually.
