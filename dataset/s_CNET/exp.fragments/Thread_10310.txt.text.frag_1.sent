so i've built a heavy hardware near top of the line computer. 
its got intel core 2 duo with stock fan 2gb ram 320gb hd dvd-r drive stock power supply it won't stay on for more than like 1 or 2 minutes after i hit the power button. 
my theory is either its overheating because the cpu fan was sort of hard to click in and seemed loose. 
or the fan just sucks. 
i only have one other fan besides the stock one and i have a zalman system cooling fan on hand that is extremely big and probably would keep the whole system layered with frost. 
anyone have any other ideas?
