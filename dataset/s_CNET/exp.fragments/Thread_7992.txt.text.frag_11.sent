well monitor is very important i think too...these days i replaced my monitor with newer vrsion and i really enjoy the big difference on playng games and working on my pc...i had viewsonic 712 8ms response time 500:1 contrast brightnes 230 cd/m^2 and now i have samsung syncmaster 932b 5ms response time 700:1 contrast 400 cd/m^2 brightnes...i must say now i see all the quality of my pc with other monitor i could't see that....so you have to buy a quality monitor to see and to experience all the quality offering of your graphic card and so on....
