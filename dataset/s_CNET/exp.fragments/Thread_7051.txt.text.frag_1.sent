coryphaeus, this is george. 
please do not joke with me when i ask for help with a problem. 
i say the &quot;puter does not recognized the cd-rom. 
in my device manager there is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark telling there is something wrong. 
i wouldn't waste your time and please if you wont help dont waste mine. 
all i ask for, is for a moderator whom i have had very successful communications with, for help. 
i troubleshoot the device, upgrade the driver, it says the present driver is the best for the cd-rom. 
it says to un-install and re-install device. 
that dont work. 
so i ask for help. 
now if you can help me, please do. 
i would truly appreciate it. 
thanks in advanced
