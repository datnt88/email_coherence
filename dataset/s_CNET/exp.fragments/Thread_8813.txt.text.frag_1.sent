hey, i wanted to upgrade my motherboard. 
i think my other one has had it and so does the guy at the computer store. 
if i'm going to upgrade, then i'd like something that fits my needs. 
i want a motherboard that will stand up to programs such as editing software including avid, photoshop, illustrator, aftereffects...to run simultaneously. 
i currently have two gigs of ram (ddr2) that i purchased which my current motherboard cannot handle. 
so it would need to support those. 
it needs to be fast. 
i'm assuming intel 4 dual core processor...but what do i know? 
i would like a pretty decent graphics card...at least to support guitar hero!! it also should have at least 4 slots for additional cards. 
any suggestions would be much appreciated?? obviously want it as cheap as possible, but able to support what i have listed...thanks.
