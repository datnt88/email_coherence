i am running an ibm 300pl 450mhz piii with 256megs of ram with winxp and i am interested in the multiple monitors setup. 
my current graphics card is an s3 trident onboard vga. 
i've attempted to include the onboad output with a pci card for the setup and also 2 pci cards. 
each card when individually in use works fine, but when i attempt to use them in a multiple monitor setup, the computer says one is a [code 10: the device does not work.] 
my only explanation is that the bios wont let me have the setup cause the second card does not show up when i boot it. the bios dates to 2001. 
any help would be great. 
thanx
