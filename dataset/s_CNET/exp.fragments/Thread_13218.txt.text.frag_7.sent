i have same issue vista64 when i do media centre it works fine, if i try to watch video or music just from pc it does not find pc and when going into media player nothing changes it, i used my xp install on spare drive and it worked straight away. 
i have checked services and the service that should allow sharing is missing. 
windows media player network sharing service i wish people wouldnt reply to threads if all they can do is put pointless replies, the info you gave is what the issue is.
