if it's a non-external powered hub (aka you don't plug it into an electrical wall outlet as well as your computer), some items like a tv tuner and some flash drives draw too much power from the usb port on your computer, and the computer can only provide so much. 
the hub gets to have such a low power output after those devices are plugged in, it can't even communicate with the computer. 
buy one with an external power connection or just don't use devices on it that make it fail.
