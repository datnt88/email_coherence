my linksys wrt54gc (version2) model router frequently stops wireless broadcasting and i have to unplug and replug the power cable to connect again. 
after some time, it again suddenly stops wireless broadcast until it's repowered. 
i've been having this problem for over 2 weeks now and tried the latest firmware upgrade and resetted the router for countless times but couldn't solve the problem. 
anyone, has experience in this issue, has any reccomendation ?
