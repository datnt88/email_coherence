i have a question regarding built in lan connections. 
i have two desktops that are being readied for use in my shop. 
both have win 7 64 bit, one professional and one home premium. 
when i wanted to download a file to install on each of them, a 350mb file, one desktop took over an hour and a half to do so, where the other desktop came in at about 8 minutes. 
same lan, realtek rtl8111d on both boards, although different manufacturers. 
one gigabyte board, one msi board. 
any ideas what might have caused this? 
perhaps a bad driver??
