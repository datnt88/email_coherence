well heck, you didn't mention exactly what it was other than a lcd. 
besides the lcd portion, there are electronics that drive lcds of the video display. 
these are corona chips, etc. which are separate items either onboard or elsewhere. 
these like a monitor can fail or simply weaken and demise output. 
in most cases they are unique to the model involved and only a pro has parts. 
but the best an end-user can do is swap parts from a savalged unit, provided they're willing and capable. 
if the lcd is that old, it may not be practical other than a learning experience. 
good luck -----willy
