here's why: (direct quote from asus specification page link you supplied) memory &quot;8 gb dual channel, ddr3 at 1333/1066/800mhz 2 x dimm: both slots must be populated for dual channel operation for optimum results. 
that means one 4 gb ram card per slot. 
otherwise, if one slot accepts 8 gb, then the other would too, giving you a total of 16 gb ram. 
note the total specified is 8 gb using both slots for dual channel operation. 
populating only one slot will result in the loss of dual channel capability and you could end up with a system that only sees 4 gb of the available 8 gb card if you only use one memory slot. 
what the slots will support depends on the memory controller specifications.
