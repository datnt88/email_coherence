sony is loosing an estimated $500 - $450 for every ps3( playstation 3) console sold. 
it cost an estimated $900 to make, and probably sold to retailers at like $400 then sold to end consumers at $500 and $600. 
400-900=500 net loss the blu-ray drive alone costs them like $300+ ea..... (normal blu-ray drives cost upwards of $1,000) the cell prossesor cost them like 200+ ea..... +all the other stuff like the graffix prossesor one hell of a losss on their part but at these pricess the ps3 ..... is helllla cheap
