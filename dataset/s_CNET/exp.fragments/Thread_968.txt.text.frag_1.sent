hi, i would like to create a desktop with a budget of 3 thousand dollars. 
i was wondering if you guys could help me out with this. 
not only do i need to get the right compatible parts but i need to find a buisness or someone who can install it properly where i wont encounter all these problems later. 
this computer will be using several art progams like 3ds max and photoshop, as well as some gaming. 
i want it to be as fast as money can buy.
