i bought my gm5478 in july 2007. 
i too had the same hourly reboots which started in october 2007. 
they would go away for a week or 2 and then come back and the fans would speed up followed by a reboot. 
like clockwork, i could predict the next event and plan accordingly. 
i updated my bios around the middle of february 2008 and i have not had one instance of the fans speeding up and the computer rebooting !!! i used: dpp3510j.15a.0298 (february 4, 2008) to update my bios. 
there a newer one available: dpp3510j.15a.0316 (july 11, 2008) update your bios if you haven't done it yet. 
i also did one other thing last february, i installed an additional fan, it's underneath the hard drive cage and is a snug fit so you don't have to mount it or secure it. 
there a spare unused 3 pin fan connector on the motherboard. 
my logic was to give the bios something else to monitor because i don't think i'm helping a lot with additional airflow. 
remember, i haven't had a single repeat of that problem for 6 months! 
goodluck!
