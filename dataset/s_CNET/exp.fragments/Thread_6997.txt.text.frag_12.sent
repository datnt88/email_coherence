okay, you're getting outside of my experience... motherboard: asus a7v8z-la chipset(s): via km400a via vt8237 (usb?) how would i determine the version of chipset drivers? 
where would i find updates? 
how would a go about applying such updates? 
btw, i'm going to take the drive to work with me tomorrow and give it a shot on my pc there. 
it's a dell, about a year old. 
if it doesn't work on it, i'll probably call it quits. 
if it does, i may just break down and buy a new pc. 
(not that i can afford to, but really can't afford not to either. 
having gone through 2 weeks of hell trying to recover a system backed up on dvds...) i've revisited via and the ms sites. 
basically, it appears to be a know issue. 
ms has a fix, but doesn't feel comfortable with it. 
so you have to open a service call with them for which there is a charge (and it still may not work). the via article is at . 
you can follow the link from there to the ms site, if interested.
