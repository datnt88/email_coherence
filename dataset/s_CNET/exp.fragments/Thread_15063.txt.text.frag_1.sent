through trial and error, and the proper software, i know how to burn mp3's to cd, and burn movies to dvd. 
but i have a jvc in dash dvd player in my car and would like to burn mp3's to dvd since the capacity is much greater. 
i am unsure which programs i could use. 
i would appreciate any experience or recommendations on programs that will achieve this? 
thanks much, scott.
