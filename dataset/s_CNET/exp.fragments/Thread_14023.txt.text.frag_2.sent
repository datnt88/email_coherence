when i did volunteer work refurbishing old computers, we used a now unsupported program called autoclave which would write varying patterns on the hard drive a user specified no. of times. 
we always used 3 times which we considered good enough for all except government. 
we also used dban (darick's boot and nuke) which is fairly popular today. 
assuming you don't have something like top secret weapons data, 3 passes is usually enough. 
if you only need protection from ordinary non-government humans without special high tech equipment, 3 passes should be more than adequate. 
` good luck.
