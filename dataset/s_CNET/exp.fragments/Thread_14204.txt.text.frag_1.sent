i have a partition question. 
if i have like 4 partitions on 2 hard drives and the c drive is obviously the os, does it mess up the the system or registry or what ever if i place programs for instance on the f drive instead of the c drive. 
for instance c:program filesadobe, i place it in f:program filesadobe as an example. 
and i am referring doing this to several programs. 
i guess my concern is if the c drive or os crashes, i don't have to reload all my software. 
does this question make sense?
