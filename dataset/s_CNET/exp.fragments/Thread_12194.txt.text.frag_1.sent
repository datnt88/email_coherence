hi, i was wondering if someone can tell me if there is an external hard drive (dual platform data storage...??) available that can hold and access my pics and videos from both my old pc and my new and therefore growing mac? 
i have a my passport, but when i try to access my pc pics using my mac, or save my mac pics onto it with the pc pics, it tells me i have to reformat and therefore loose all currently stored data. 
any guidance would be appreciated! 
thanks
