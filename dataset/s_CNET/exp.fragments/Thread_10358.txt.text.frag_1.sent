i am a real organize freak and a thing that really bugs me are random files that have been installed on my second harddrive. 
when i double click on that harddrive it opens it up and brings me with the folders i have put on it, but also things that have been in stalled in the past. 
two of the folders on there are just a bunch of numbers. 
also there is a file called &quot;wutempt&quot;, and &quot;msdownload.tmp&quot; and four ffast files. is there anyway i can move these without hurting anything.
