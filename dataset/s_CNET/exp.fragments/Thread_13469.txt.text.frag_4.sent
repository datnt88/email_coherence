svhost.exe is a helper app which is called up by some other application. 
since killing svchost is incorrect from the gitgo, it would be proper for all versions of xp to logout or reboot if you killed it. 
do a deeper inspection with the command line tool called tasklist (i won't write deeply about this since you can research with google.com.) next look at the output of tasklist /svc to see what called svchost. 
nothing appears amiss here that a little more knowledge can't cure.
