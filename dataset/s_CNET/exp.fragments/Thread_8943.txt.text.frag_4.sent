let me tip my hand a little. 
i have worked over the years in the design of surveillance dvrs. 
that format is the video format and has little to do with the hdd format. 
it appears you may only need to pop in a new drive but given what i read above i wonder if you set the jumpers on the new drive the same as the old drive.
