also most servers have dual nics in them. 
i assume that you have a t1 line. 
you could upgrade to an amd64 dual core later on. 
yes a dual processor would be better. 
check out server boards at newegg.com maybe a dual processor mb and add the second processor later. 
if i were doing this i would put the os on a seprate hd from the raid data drives, but thats just me.
