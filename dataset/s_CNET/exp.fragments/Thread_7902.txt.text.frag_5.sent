if i purchase the above kit would that be appropriate? 
it is aa 4gb kit (2gbx2), 240-pin dimm, ddr2 pc2-8500 memory module. the others are pc2-5300 or pc2-6400, i don't know what that means but assumed that the higher number was better, and it still didn't exceed the recommended max. 
if i did purchase this memory, would i remove the one 1gb installed and install this 2 pc into slots 1 and 2? please forgive my ignorance, i would rather learn how to do it myself than go have someone else do it. 
thanks again!
