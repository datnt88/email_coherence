are you sure a cpu upgrade is the best thing to do? 
an alternative is adding ram. 
it's not sure which one is better. 
and there's always the option to start all over with the same hardware by a system recovery, going back to factory conditions. 
then it's just as fast as it was when it was new. 
really. 
then do all windows updates, install the programs you still use, get back all your personal data from your backup and enjoy! 
only if it's still slow then, new hardware is a necessity.
