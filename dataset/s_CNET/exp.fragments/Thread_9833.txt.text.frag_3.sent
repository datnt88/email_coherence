why my mac can &quot;see&quot; the 500 gig drive in the owc fw enclosure and not the 200 gig drive in the older maxtor fw enclosure. 
these are both external drives in case i was not clear on that aspect. 
thanks for your reply mrmacfixit, but i am somewhat at more of a loss now. 
i have these just plugged into the regular fw ports on the mac also - no mods or pci cards installed. 
also my g4 is one of the dual boot macs. the hd size remains the same whether in x or 9 and are as stated above. 
thanks again for any info,
