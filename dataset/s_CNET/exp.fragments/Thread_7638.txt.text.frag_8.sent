since this is a build of gathered used and/or some new, you need to rebuild again. 
as stated to you, its best to remove and build on some cardboard and check operations that way. 
use a household fan to cool it as added cooling. 
if it works for some extended period, like in hrs. 
then you then need to check/inspect the case as mentioned. 
note where standoffs are, etc. and return mtbd. 
alone to case. 
tighten screws but don't over do it and make some are grounded if plastic standoffs are used as well. 
understand what psu you have, is it single or dual rail type. 
if dual, balance the load requirements better or replace entirely. 
build the pc as basic as possibel and check results to see how it operates. 
also, just where did it fail after 1hr. 
how did it fail, shutdown, froze, didn't respond, still loading s/w, maybe the last action is the culprit. 
don't do any oc'ing if so done, return to defaults. 
have you updated the bios yet before any major installs, etc.? was the parts tested elsewhere or do you know its history, etc.. if you got a good deal at the time, you may now know why, it was an iffy part. 
in other words don't take things for granted, you now have to sort things out and test results. 
last, did you apply heatsink paste correctly on cpu as that can be a sign it failed when it got to be too much heat or pushed into a upper heat range. 
further, do all fans or cooling work as intended? 
you need to know your &quot;airflow&quot; as some operations may conflict. 
it may already bee too late if due to heat stress the weakest link finally gave in and failed. 
one thing i have the habit of doing is swapping the psu out, if during power-on the cpu fan just twitches or spins for a moment, then nothing. 
if it isn't the psu then that leaves the mtrbd., and any issues arising from operation, not good. 
so recheck your work as best as possible.
