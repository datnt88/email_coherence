no, it's not a good idea, and here's why; a flash drive has a limited life - i've heard 100,000 &quot;writes&quot; mentioned as the limit. 
if the drive is flashing, it means that it's being accessed, and it's life being used up. 
this is specially true of &quot;journalling&quot; os's, like ntfs; a read accesses the drive as much as a write. 
burn it to disc(s)and get an external hard drive; most come with backup software. 
yes, and burn that to disc. 
today is a good day to do this.
