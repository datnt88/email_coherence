is not the westell unit a dsl gateway? 
typically that is what verizon/frontier furnishes, at least recently. 
it is a combination unit wireless capable, modem/router in one unit, which would preclude the use of another router for general purposes. 
whereas if you were to use your linksys unit you would use a separate modem. 
the problem is dsl, your linksys router is set up for use with a cable modem, which is a different ball game. 
that is i guess you could say, a &quot;gotcha&quot; with verizon/frontier dsl hook ups since they are fed by a phone link instead of cable. is there a work around? 
well that's the question for verizon/frontier, i would love to hear their answer to this one. 
it goes to firmware and of course hook up(s).
