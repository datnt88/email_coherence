hi again, thanks for the input. 
i understand the post and what is being checked. the delay i refer is when the power button is pushed in about 5-6 times before actual power. 
i have to push the power button for 5-6 times before it comes on after i take away the cord. 
once the power is on, it reboots in the normal time. 
i tried to determine if the video card (which can make a system not function properly) is the cause by changing video cards. 
i saw a difference but it still took 5-6 times of pushing in the power button before the system could began the post. 
once the system loads the post is fine. 
i have tried to adjust the bios ram and temperature to see.
