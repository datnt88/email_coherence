as of today, the kindle fire hd is a better content streamer, the nexus 7 is more open operating system. 
the kindle fire hd will allow micro hdmi, if that is all in play. 
however, without all that much trouble, the kindle fire hd can access pretty much anything you need, it will take some sideloading to do this, if you do not want to deal with this, get the nexus, the kindle may be superior in terms of sound and screen , but if you personally will find it annoying that you have spend 20 -30 minutes to figure out how to access something outside of the amazon world, dont bother. 
nexus allows you to enter both ecosystems, as does the majority of andriod tabs out there. 
(btw, i have the vast majority of items on my kindle that amazon doesnt want you to play with, so in terms of functionality , you pretty much can do anything on either, it just takes more work to do it on the kindle) right now on my kindle.. chrome and dolphin for browsing flash 11.1 player wondershare for open access to free hulu service google sky you tube nook (for when i only can get the epub version of books) or you could probably just stay in amazon's world, with thier prime and have enough stuff to keep you entertained, i just dont like paying access for stuff i can get for free otherwise. 
wondershare has been a revelation to me as well.. what a wonderful app..
