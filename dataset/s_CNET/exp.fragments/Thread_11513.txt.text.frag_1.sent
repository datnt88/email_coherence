hi all. 
i've recently purchased a benq 52x24x52 external cd rewriter, and i'm experiencing some difficulties. 
i'd really apreciate it if anyone could help me out... here we go: i use win2k pro on a sony vaio laptop computer. 
the rewriter came with no device drivers of its own, and documentation suggested the use of standard windows drivers, which worked fine... i can burn cd's just fine, but i cannot select any other burning speed than 4x, even with ultra-speed compatible cd-r's. 
i went to the company's site for drivers.. all i found was firmware, which didn't fix the problem. 
being a novice in cd burning, i'm very frustrated not to be able to use the cdwriter to its full potential. 
any help at all would be sincerely apreciated. 
thanks.
