i've been reading up about external hard drives since i plan on purchasing one for my laptop. 
but for every good drive i hear about, there are 3 bad reviews of it. 
it also seems that reviewers like cnet give a good review, while the user reviews are completely different (poor). 
basically, which drive would you guys recommend as a reliable drive. 
p.s. i'm looking for a 250gb drive. 
thanks, duckhunter
