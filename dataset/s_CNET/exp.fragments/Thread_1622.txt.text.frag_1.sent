i have a 2010 macbook pro computer that wirelessly connects to the internet via an apple time machine. 
i currently have an hp photosmart c7200 printer that i could never get to function wirelessly. is there any e-printers (multi function) scan and print that i could get to work wirelessly for all functions? 
thanks!
