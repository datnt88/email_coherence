i had 512 of pc2100 on my xp pro system running a athlon xp 2400 and abit n7f motherboard. 
for about $30.00 more i got cosair 1 gig pc3200 for what it would hae cost for 1 512 of crucial pc2100. 
now why does not my system show an improvement in preformance due to the faster memory and higher bus speed.
