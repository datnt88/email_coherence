i know i recently made a post on this, but things have now changed. 
i have a printer installed on this laptop (vista basic). 
i need to share this printer on a network with another laptop (vista premium). 
i have no idea how to do this. 
i know the computer names. 
i don't know how to find the server or printer names. 
and vista likes to be so damn difficult, i can't find a run feature to use the cmd thing. 
someome please explain to me what the hell i have to do.
