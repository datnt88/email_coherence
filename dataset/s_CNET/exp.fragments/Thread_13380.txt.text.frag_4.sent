linda... 1. two anti-virus applications (these two) cannot exit together. 
uninstall one of them. 
2. prop the laptop off the table, anything will do, by a couple of inches. 
3. boot into safe mode and run your virus scans. 
i've had scans stopped by viruses and have found safe mode the only way to complete the scans.
