cory, oh, i'm sure it will work perfectly in g mode -- that isn't the problem. the problem is that g mode isn't fast enough for what i need (my existing linksys works fine in g mode as well -- but i need about double the speed of what g mode can provide). 
as i said, i'm streaming very high bitrate files (i need at least 29mbps). the lower rate files i stream (anything less than 10gb total size) work fine. 
i will need to run the dir-655 in n exclusive mode in order to get it to do what i want.
