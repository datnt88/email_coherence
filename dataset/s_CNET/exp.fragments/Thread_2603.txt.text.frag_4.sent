you have to use &quot;thier method&quot; of best performance to get that. the achieval ink and paper is of prime cost and while works, isn't imho better than true photos. 
you can save the digital images and then print on demand which is the better outcome of this side of the fence photos provided you can prolong any digital saving. the ink and paper are still vulnerable to uv and they still suggest you place in safe enviroment for safe storage and/or placement(wall?) using frames of glass enclosures in non-direct sunlight. 
gee, what's the point. 
they're doing better but it still doesn't come anywhere near true film photos for now. 
as for achival ink, those sold as &quot;photo ink/grade&quot; are the achival type. 
make sure the printer supports this and the setting is set for it under its printing modes.
