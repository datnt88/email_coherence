are all your components new? 
when you get the blue screen, doesn't it give a long list of numbers and letters? 
if so what are they - make a note when it happens again before shutting system down. 
you can also google those numbers to get more info. 
what are the power issues you have? 
you 850w psu should be overkill for your system, it should draw about 400w under full load. 
did you run memtest to confirm memory stability after build? 
was the memory from the mobo approved list or did gskill show that their memory was compatible with your mobo? 
did you have any probems loading drivers? 
did you get the latest drivers for your video card from manufacturers website? 
go to start/settings/control panel/system & maintenace then scroll down to device manager and click on it. 
you will see a list of devices. 
are there any red or yellow marks (such as question marks) next to any item. 
if so which one? they indicate problems, usually drive related, with the specific device. 
have you rechecked all power and other cabling to make sure it is secure? 
did you make any system changes - hardware or software in the 2 days prior to the first occurrence?
