i have a lot of old vinyl and cassettes that i want to transfer to digital format on my computer. 
since the source of these formats are analog, and the typical line-in on a sound card is analog, i am wondering how i can best tranfer the audio data to digital. 
my stereo receiver does not have a digital output, only inputs. 
i guess what i am asking is for the &quot;best&quot; means to convert old format audio to digital and what hardware/software should i be looking at? 
particularly the sound card and the proper input to the pc for capturing the digital conversion. 
thanks.
