seagate sent me a new sata drive under warranty. 
i created two partitions one 40 gig one(for xp)180 gig (for storage). 
formatted both ntfs using partition magic. 
transfered my files from bad drive to new 180 gig partition. 
left 40gig blank formatted as ntfs for fresh xp install. 
i began installing xp but it wouldn't allow me to install onto 40 gig partition so i deleted the partition thinking i would just have xp reformat it again as ntfs. 
problem is, xp only format as [new (raw)] and doesn't give the ntfs format option. 
at this point i don't have an os on the machine so i'm not sure what to do. 
something else which may or may not be of interest. the drive comes up as third ide master in the bios, primary ide mater [not detected], seconday ide master is my dvd drive. 
any suggestions are appreciated. 
thanks.
