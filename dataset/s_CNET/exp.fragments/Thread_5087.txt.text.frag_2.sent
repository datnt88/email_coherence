&quot;if your all-in-one has a problem, make sure: your all-in-one is on. 
you removed the stickers and tape from the bottom of the ink cartridges. 
for help, refer to the setup documentation. the paper is loaded correctly. 
you installed both of the ink cartridges. the dell aio printer a920 will only work if you have both cartridges installed. 
&quot; sadly this printer has no self test button.
