thanks, for answering my question and next time i will post more about my computer. 
there is nothing wrong with the gpu fan that i have, the default fan is just really rubish and i am going to replace it and was seeing if you guys knew about any good ones. 
next time i will try to word the question better. 
thanks, for giving me some ideas and i will try to get all the dust out of my computer more often.
