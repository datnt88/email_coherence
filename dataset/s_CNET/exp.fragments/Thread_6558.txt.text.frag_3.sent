i have a new compaq cq61-313us notebook with windows 7 and a 2005 netgear router that works fine. 
i have the router set for wpa-psk and a long passphrase with a combination of 10 letters and numbers. 
i have my computer wireless network properties set for wpa-personal and encryption type tkip. 
when i changed the encryption to aes i lost my wireless connection so i changed it back to tkip and got my connection back. 
should i change the wpa-personal to wpa 2-personal? 
if so should i change the tkip to aes or leave it on tkip? 
would my router support this change?
