my computer is not making sound. 
i can play a cd and hear it but as far as listening to i tunes or a web based video no sound comes across. 
i have looked under control panel and everything seems ok except in the sounds and audio devices properties, no audio device is found. 
there are no conflicts under system properties. 
i have not added any no hardware or software. 
does anybody know what could be up? 
has anyone seen an algorithmic/flow chart approach to debugging problems like this? any easy way to test a sound card?
