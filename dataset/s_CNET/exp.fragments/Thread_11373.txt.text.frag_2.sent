this is a pretty broad questions, with lots of things to consider... you said you have a page registered, do you know how/where you will be hosting it? 
are you going to be running your own server or will you have it hosted by another company? 
since you are a small business, i would assume you will have someone host the site for you. 
i would work with whomever you have host your site to answer your other questions. 
some companies will have development tools as part of the hosting package. 
others will require you to create the files yourself (using any popular program, dreamweaver, frontpage, etc.) and use ftp to upload them to a server. 
i think you need to resolve the hosting question first before you can start to consider the development.
