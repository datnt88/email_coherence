hi i am in, have removed hard drive just would like to try the battery fix but can not see for the life of me where its is. 
i am guessing it is under something else i need to take off? 
i think i will need a special screw driver - done ok so far but some of these screws in side i am struggling with - if you can tell me where battery is that would be great thanks j
