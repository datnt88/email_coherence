i tried it all. 
then i listened to an npr radio show taliking about all the malware out there. 
i have kaspesky full virus protection and ran a scan of &quot;riskware&quot;. it told me that i had outdated and dangerous old versions of adobe reader and java. 
i went to &quot;add/remove programs&quot; on &quot;my computer&quot; and deleted all of the above. 
then, i added the newest versions of each and turned of my computer. 
now i'm back up and running on all usb's and my computer is working faster. 
play iy safe. 
get a good v protection no matter what it cost's and scan frequently. 
get updates on all programs and make sure the old versions are gone. 
i hope this works for you. 
i tried everything else!
