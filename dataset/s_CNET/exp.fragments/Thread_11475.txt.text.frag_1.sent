i am interested in buying a wireless projector for home use. 
i plan to mount it to the ceiling. 
it will just be using it with my computer for general applications and display (not for gaming). the projection distance will be about 8 to 10 feet. 
ideally i would like to have 1024 x 768 resolution, but could live with less. 
most of the projectors that have come up in my search are over $1000.00. 
can anyone recommend a good projector or two, that is under $1000.00 (including the networking capability). 
also, do i need a special wireless router to use it? 
i just have a broadband wireless router (linksys wrt160n), will this work for this purpose? 
thank you.
