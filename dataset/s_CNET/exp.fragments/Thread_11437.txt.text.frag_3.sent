the computer that has the 2 lan ports is halfway between the dsl modem and the second computer and i have a cable long enough to reach the second computer. 
the computers are on the same floor so easy to run a cable. the dsl modem is on a different floor and at the othe end of the house, running a cable would not be easy so i thought maybe with equipment i have i could cheat and make it easy. 
oh well, just a thought. 
thanks very much sean
