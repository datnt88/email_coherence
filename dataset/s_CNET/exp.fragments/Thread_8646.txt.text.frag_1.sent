i'm setting up a tlp zebra 2844-z on a windows xp machine sp3. 
and i can't get it to print anything. 
i have it connected to a desktop computer via usb cable. the printer works fine as it will print it's own test lables and it feeds the lables properly. 
i've tried using a parallel cabel and nothing changed. 
when i go to &quot;priners and faxes&quot; the printer shows up after i've insalled it. 
it says &quot;ready&quot;. i go to print a windows test page and the the print job is added to the que and sits there. 
it seems to me to be a communication issue but i don't know where to go from there. 
any help or advice is greatly appreciated. 
thank you!
