since you've uninstalled sp2, i would uninstall the device, then re-install. 
i'm not sure about the multimedia device with the question mark. 
could be onboard audio, or may be related to the sound card. 
i always try to eliminate all question marks by reinstalling. 
i'm unsure if this will solve the problem, but it's easy enough to try.
