the vision website wasn't very helpful. 
but this shouldn't be too much of a problem. 
i do need more info before i can give you the proper instruction. 
expecially if you aren't used to getting into your machine. 
i need to know how many harddrives and cdroms are installed on your system. 
also, tell me a little bit about your experience in taking apart systems. 
let me know. 
and life goes on... jack
