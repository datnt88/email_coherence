we have a 1987(circa) compaq portable 3, with dos 3.1 installed. 
5&quot; floppy. 
a few weeks ago i used it to do a bit of batchfile stuff to show people what it looked like in 'the old days'.i've 
just fired her up again and got '1790 - disk 0 error' which i believe to mean hard disk failure. is this the end of the the computer without perhaps major surgery? 
can i get into the bios? is there a bios to get into? 
any thoughts would be most welcome.
