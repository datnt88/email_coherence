like many on this & other forums, went searching for possible issues with my gateway gt5636e. 
i have the core 2 quad 6600 2.4 processor model. 
i have now owned it for approx. 
18 months. 
mine was fine until, of course, the one year warranty ended. 
within a couple weeks of warranty expiration, mine started doing instant shutdowns. 
when trying to restart, it would begin to power up then shut right back down. 
first thing i made sure all dust-bunnies were cleaned from both the outside and inside of the pc. first time problem began this seemed to take care of it for a couple months. 
then one day it started again. 
checked it and this time it was very clean. 
after putting it all back together again it worked fine again... for maybe a month. 
then it started again. 
repeat above. 
then one day i went to start the pc and actually missed the power button with my finger. 
i instead had lightly pushed down on the surrounding plastic bezel. the pc powered up! 
whoa, wait a minute. 
i let it power up, shut it down, did it again. 
here is what i found: the top plastic bezel on my gt model that is labeled &quot;digital media manager&quot; was mis-aligned and the on/off button for the power supply was actually rubbing on the bezel! 
once i took the case apart & pushed/moved/loosened/tightend all i could, the power button was now freely moving in and out of the bezel. 
i have not had one pc sudden shutdown on my gt5636e for at least 3 months since! it has been perfect. 
if you are having similar problems with your gateway, first, make sure it is clean inside and out, then check to see if your power off/on button is getting stuck on the plastic bezel. 
my best guess is that the button on mine was not popping out all the way after a morning boot up. 
eventually with the button half in, it would shut itself down.
