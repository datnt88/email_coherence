turn off any firewalls on all pcs for the local network. 
make sure printer and file sharing for ms networks is enabled in your network device settings. 
decide on what you want to share or create a share on each pc. 
generally this will be a folder or other folders with or without subfolders. 
turn sharing on for these. 
make sure each user that will have access to the shares has an account defined on each pc. 
give that account the same username/password on each. 
these steps will get you started but i can't guarantee more tweaking won't be needed. 
you didn't provide the os and version. 
xp pro and home will have some differences that could cause connection issues but these can be worked out. 
start here and post back with progress if you need more help.
