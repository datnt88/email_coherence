my dad has a large library of dvd's, and the dvd players in my house are really beginning to suck. 
so i thought for this xmas i would buy him an apple tv. what i'd like to do is buy a large hd (like a tb or something), and then rip his dvd movies to the drive so it can be connected to a computer and accessed by appletv whenever he wants to watch something. 
does anyone know what i could do to get this done quickly, because i don't have the time to sit on my mbp and rip 300+ movies to my hard drive and then drag them to an external hd... i was hoping there was some hardware that could convert dvds to digital format within minutes i could use. 
thanks, alegoo92
