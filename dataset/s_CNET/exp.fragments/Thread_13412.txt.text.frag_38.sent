i run a small coffee shop, we serve about 100 meals a day mainly breakfasts and sell loads of coffee and tea. 
my free wiffi was made useless with the number of leachers which angered my paying customers, after all it was for them... the solution came from a regular...i began collecting e-mail addresses from regulars to send out daily specials, news, and odd bits like trivia...my regulars all get a new password every week as well as a free coffee now and then. 
i still have to give out the password to some who ask, or aren't regulars, but it's now a good service and a good reward for my customers. 
it takes three minutes to change once or twice a week and is always whatever is on special that week, this weeks password is 'scone' it's a simple thing to keep my customers happy, and even the kids who leach the signal once in a while end up having to buy something to get the password from me...and then it changes in the new e-mail flyer i send out. 
on the positive side, i have a great e-mail client list, they love the specials that come in the emails, i sell out of everything on special, we have developed a great trivia game through the emails, and my problem was solved in a positive way with no angry people.
