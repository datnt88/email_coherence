i've decided i can't live with this problem and as the pc is long past it's sell-by date (amd 1.1, geforce2, top-notch at the time), i now have a new core2 duo e6700 with all the trimmings on order ... don't tell my wife or bank manager i'm still curious (i hate defeat), so i may try replacing the battery, just to see if that makes any difference - i can then use the old pc as a server. the switch is moulded into the case which makes changing it an ugly job, and if it's the motherboard it's probably not worth worrying about. 
thank you all for your help ...
