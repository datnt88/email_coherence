mr. proffitt: maybe i'm not understanding your reference to data recovery houses. 
not sure you understood earlier problem description. 
data recovery is not what i'm concerned about. 
security of personal financial data is my concern. 
if i'd guessed the tablet would die as quickly as it did, of course i would have erased it....would not have put it on to begin with. 
hindsight is.............. . 
acer support classified the precursor signs and final premature death of my acer iconia a500, a &quot;hardware problem,&quot; and without further ado, asked me to ship it to texas repair solution.... at my cost incidentally...even within the warranty period. 
great depression days remember! 
yep mr. proffitt... life is full of them (hard decisions i mean)... and, i don't trust them, human frailties being what they are. 
understand them..i think. 
financial data too fruitful to ignore...even when acer support tells me data not accessible to repair technicians. 
i'm not an expert by any means.. especially with tablet hardware....but give me a break! 
thanks again for replying.
