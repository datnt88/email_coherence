i changed the power supply to 430watt bought two kingston 256mb ram (might of been bad ram before) changed the mobo to asus a7n8x-x reformatted, dad started playing and now after 2-3 weeks its giving him blue screen and freezing his pc just like it did before i started this thread. 
only thing we didn't do is change the cpu but this is starting to get cost effective, we bought a new mobo, powersupply and new ram tell me what you think
