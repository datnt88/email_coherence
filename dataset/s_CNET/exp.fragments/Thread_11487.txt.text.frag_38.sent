patches. the attack employed said extra ap as part of the attack. 
it was a great idea but the extra ap was not the target of the attack. 
you seem to think this stuff is secure. 
it's not. 
i don't want to keep tossing out more and more exploits but to share that we should be asking for something as secure as say pgp. now that would be impressive.
