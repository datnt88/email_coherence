i know a little bit about computers but i would be too scared to try replacing the drive myself. 
getting someone else to do it is costly. 
so i'd probably go the external usb route. 
but that's at least $60 on ebay at the cheapest and of course money is tight these days. 
i just wanted to make sure i had exhausted all possible avenues before buying a new one. 
anybody got any other suggestions for me on how to fix this one?
