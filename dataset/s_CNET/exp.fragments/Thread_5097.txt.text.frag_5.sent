i wanted to thank everyone for their answers! 
you have all been incredibly helpful in helping me make an informed decision. 
for a while there, i was leaning towards just buying an lcd tv and hooking my computer to it, but i really liked what the hp media center had to offer. the price on it right now for the bundle is great, and it seems to have excellent options. 
i'm about 99% on buying it now! 
thanks again! 
ps - what about the speakers? 
i read some reviews that they're not so swift. 
any truth to that?
