thanks very much for pointing me to the setup software, i was able to download it and proceeded to install it. 
however, the installation hangs at the point where i physically connect the maxtor drive. 
did you actually get a prompt for a password after installing the setup software and connecting the hard drive? 
it looks to me like the setup software cannot detect the drive (just like windows doesn't) because the drive is locked and so it just keeps trying to access the maxtor external drive and gets nowhere. is there really a point where the software realizes the drive is locked and asks for the password? 
i have been avoiding using mrzinguy's more drastic solution (its like kicking down the door of your house when you lock yourself out)as i hate to rip the drive apart. 
however, i am beginning to think i may have no other choice. 
before i take that approach, however, i am hoping there is something i am missing when installing the setup software. 
anyone have any ideas?
