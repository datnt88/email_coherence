to determine why requires a few million bucks of equipment in some radio site survey truck. 
for well under 100 bucks, a repeater will likely just cure it. 
let me share that a microwave oven cohabits this frequency space and is some 1000 watts. 
it's not supposed to leak much but i have seen them interfere with wifi operation. 
if you want to know why, i must bow out now. 
if you want to fix it, the repeater will likely cure it. 
it has so far.
