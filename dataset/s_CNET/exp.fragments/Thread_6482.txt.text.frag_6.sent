the techs at the computer store where i buy most of my pc parts recommended the radeon 9600 when i was shopping for a vid card upgrade to keep up with gta3. 
i have a ti4200 that can play most games- dx 1 & 2, hitman 2 & 3, max payne 1 & 2, call of duty. it can't keep up with far cry either (good thing i only played the demo from maxpc). 
i didn't go with the radeon cuz i know so many people with driver problems. 
i'm waiting for the ultra series cards to come down, then upgrade. 
no way am i gonna pay ~$300 for a vid card! 
i didn't even know there was a ti*4800* until i read your post. 
i wonder if nvidia is playing some kinda shell game with their naming convention- remember when they had the mmx cards, and were calling them g4s? 
i think one of the main things to consider (so i'm told) are the engine/memory clock-speeds of the card. 
i think my ti4200 is 550 mhz; mebbe that's why it can play most games very well. 
i just looked at the specs of the card you linked, and it looks very much as mine, 'cept my card isn't agp 8x! hmmm....well, newegg is a pretty good place to look at user reviews. 
i was looking at some cards at circuit city, and the guy recomended i try some xfx card, and if i didn't like it, simply return it. 
they didn't have too many nvidia based cards, but they had the radeon 9600 (which was highly recommended by the cc salesman to cure my frame-rate prob w/gta3.) personally, i'll stick w/nvidia, after i figure out what the heck all these new card names really mean good luck. 
would be interested in your choice and how well it works. 
i think has a good guide for vid cards; last i looked, there was a chart, with benchmarks and everything. 
oh, another reason i wont go ati, is i've seen some games that specifically say it won't play on ati based cards- like silent hill (crappy game.)happy shopping.
