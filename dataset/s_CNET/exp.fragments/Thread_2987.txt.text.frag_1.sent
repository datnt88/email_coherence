i just built this computer. 
specs are below: amd athlon 64 3000+ socket 939 msi neo2 platinum socket 939 corsair xms twinx 2x512 ddr400 1024c2pt leadtek gefore 6800 gt tdh a400 gt lite on cd-rw + dvd-rom mitsumi floppy hitachi desktar 60gb hard drive ata100 all up to date drivers + bios ver 1.41 windows xp professional with all updates inc sp2 the computer runs and boots fine. 
however, if left unattended, it will sometimes freeze. 
sometimes it will freeze when you use it but not as often as when left unattended. 
also, when i load the corecenter and digicell programs from msi, the computer freezes upon booting when the program auto starts up everytime. 
so i removed those and the computer just locks up like usual, unattended. 
also, sometimes the computer will run lockup free for like a week. 
then one day, like over night, i will leave it on and i wake up the next morning and its frozen. 
also, sometimes if it is frozen, the computer will still be running, like the clock, but the mouse and keyboard don't respond. 
if i hold in the power button to shut it off, the computer will go into the shutdown process, then freeze there once it says windows is shutting down. 
this computer is like i said brand new. 
only a couple weeks old. 
i built the computer, and no i am not a person who thought they could put together a person without knowing much about computers. 
i have built several. 
i e-mailed msi and they told me to try swapping out the memory. 
so i just did that like 5 minutes ago and i will see what the results are
