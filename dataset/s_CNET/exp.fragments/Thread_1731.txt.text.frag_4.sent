they've not been around that long to prove it but neither have the seagates. 
i have a mix of seagate and wds (plus a few surviving ibms). 
i use the wd raptors as primary drives. 
these are not yet at the capacity of the others but run at 10000 rpm and are quite perky. 
the seagates i pair in raid 1 arrays to store data and as part of my backup scheme. 
raid 1 provides some security against hd failure. 
keep in mind that a warranty does not get back your data. 
it just gives you a replacement empty drive if yours fails within the warranty period and that replacement might be a &quot;refurb&quot; unit.
