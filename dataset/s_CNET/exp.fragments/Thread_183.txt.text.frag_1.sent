i have a gateway dx-4305c desktop that has loud cooling fans. 
i just replaced my 2007 main desktop with this one that i got from a buddy because it crashed. 
it's a couple years newer and i liked the idea of a quad-core instead of a dual-core processor, my old computer (hp pavilion m8100n media center) was always super super quiet, even when i was running the processor near 100% all the time (video/picture editing and multimedia). 
it is still running as a secondary desktop beside this one and it's absolutely silent. 
this one at 35% processor usage, the fan is almost unbearable! 
what kind of fan should i replace them with that won't sound like a jet plane when they they kick in? 
i find that gateway, seemingly being the &quot;low end&quot; of acer, uses cheap parts in their computers (power supplies, optical drives, fans etc.) so i would like to upgrade this component to something quality! 
thanks for your support!
