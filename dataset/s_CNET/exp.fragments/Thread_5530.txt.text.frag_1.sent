i have a four+ year old dell desktop with a geforce3 ti 200 graphics card. 
i want to upgrade to a card with more dedicated memory preparing for adding vista later. 
don't play graphics intensive games. 
could anyone please confirm my old card is in an agp slot? 
2x/4x or 4x/8x??? any recommendations for models,brands or store would be appreciated. 
thanks.
