have an imac 400dv, slot load, os 9.2.2 that blew up. 
logic board and analog board are toast. 
repair removed hard drive, and determined data was recoverable. 
now, have bought new imac g5, 1.8, sd.and would like to transfer some files from old hd if possible. 
backup was current to 2 weeks before crash and burn. 
what is best way to grab files from old hd? do i need an enclosure for old hd as well as cable? 
thanks for help.
