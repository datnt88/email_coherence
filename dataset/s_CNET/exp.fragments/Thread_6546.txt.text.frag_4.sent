i'd no idea it meant wiping the disks! 
i've got my c: backed up on an external, but the os is vista home premium. 
it claims to be backing up my programs, settings, files, updates, etc. i wonder now if this is really worth doing. 
i use photoshop and really wanted the performance to be top notch, hence, adding the second drive to use as a scratch disk. 
thanks for the warning!
