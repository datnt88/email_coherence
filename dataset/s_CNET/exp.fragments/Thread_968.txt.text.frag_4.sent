here's a newegg shopping cart with my suggested components: i didn't know if you wanted a sound card, so there isn't one in that list. 
i also didn't know what kind of optical drives you wanted, so i didn't include any. 
finally, i'm assuming that you need windows, but i didn't include it in that list. 
there are two gigabytes of ram because 4 gigs is the limit for a 32-bit os. you will get lots of crashes and error messages. 
windows vista will be a 64-bit os, so if you choose to upgrade to vista, you can upgrade the ram at the same time. 
you could probably get a local computer store to build it for you. 
not best buy or compusa, but a smaller store. 
or just give a nerd some money, a warm meal, and a place to sleep, and let them build it for you. the two hard drives should be put in raid 1. with a raid 1 setup, when you save a file, it gets saved on both drives. 
if one drive fails, you still all your data on the other one. 
for $3,000 you can't get the fastest parts that money can buy (there are some processors that cost $1,000 alone), but you don't need the top-of the line cpu.
