i downloaded nokia pc suite from nokia web site for my phone model. 
it still doesn't work. 
i clicked get connected button and choosed infrared connection. 
although i made sure my phone's infrared is activated and placed it in front of the infrared receiver in my computer, it didn't work. 
i don't like any kind of wireless communication because sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 
it is such an unreliable connection. 
regarding other laptops work, i don't get what you mean exactly. 
my friend had same laptop, he can send photos from his sony erickson phone to his laptop. 
i asked him whether he installed anything to laptop or not. 
he answered that he didn't. 
i asked if he configured anything related to infrared such as infrared activation of laptop. 
he answered that he didn't. 
he just send the photos from his phone to laptop by putting his phone in front of the infrared receiver.
