thank you all for gettin back to me. 
i read every post carefully. 
right after r. proffitt's first reply, i went ahead and ordered a 200 gig seagate barracuda st3200826as from newegg. 
little brown truck delivered it today, i waited for the delivery to post back. 
i chose that one because they had free shipping on it. 
also, this is the last of an older line that they call sata 150 , the newest line does something they call &quot;perpendicular&quot; recording. 
i was thinking along with the poster that said sometimes the first of the new may not be as dependable as the last of the old. 
now, i got a new hd and new os to play with and gotta go. 
thanks, all !! ol rod
