so let's start with remember this system may let you record content but will not create a dvd from such. 
for that you have to buy something that will handle the usual dvr-ms files that media center creates. the trick is to get the camcorder showing on the tv settings. 
and once there you can record it to the usual dvr-ms files. 
for me this is far too much work so i move to other software fast.
