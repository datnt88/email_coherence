don't know if this problem is old news, but i had the same problem today and discovered very simple explanation. 
my dell truemobile wireless utility showed multiple wireless networks, but my windows wireless network connection utility showed none. 
so my wireless card seemed to be working fine, except that i could not sign onto any networks, and ipconfig showed &quot;media disconnected&quot;. 
after updating the driver, deleting from the device manager and rebooting, and several others of the &quot;usual&quot; fixes, i discovered that the dell wireless utility was checked to &quot;let this tool manage your wireless settings&quot;. 
turns out the windows utility was also checked to be in control. 
i unchecked the dell utility and everything immediately worked fine. 
a quick and logical fix that should be checked before (like me) you try all the other fixes.
