i have no idea about the virus thing. 
on this machine when i boot i get a couple of bios screens that show the hd's the bios found. 
so... if you get those sort of screens you might want to watch them close and verify that the bios is not missing the &quot;d&quot; hd during it's probe. 
i suspect that if the bios is missing the hd then the os will have a problem.
