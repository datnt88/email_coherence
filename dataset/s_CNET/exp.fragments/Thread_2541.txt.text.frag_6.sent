wayne, thanks for all the help, but i still have some questions. 
i want to print form both computers, d-link says i need a di-707 (router w/ print server), dwl-2100ap (access point), along with the dwlg520 adapter, i want to go with the 520 and just the di624 router. 
can i enable windows file&print sharing and get the same job done without any problems? 
can i use my scanner with the same setup.
