&quot;is the fact that my actual tv and cable box is on the other side of the house won't be a problem right?&quot; 
if you have two cable jacks/outputs - one for your tv on the other side of the house and one for your cable modem it shouldn't be a problem. 
&quot;is the cable signal that goes to my cable modem the same cable signal that goes to my cable box?&quot; it was something i doubted and researched a lot with some saying it was and others saying it wasn't. 
all i know is my internet works just fine and i can watch tv. it worked for me but i can't say for certain it will work for you. 
and as for what worked for me, it's basic cable - no high def channels (although that's a whole different beast) and no channels over a 100. 
i might try and figure out how to fix that because some over a 100 are basic cable channels. 
good luck.
