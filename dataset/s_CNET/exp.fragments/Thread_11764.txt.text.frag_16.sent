finally i got mine to work! was kinda simple. 
1. i went into the xbox 360 and entered a static ip and all that. 
2. in virtual server-pppoe/dhcp/static configuration settings on the router open port: 53,80,3074,88,42042,42052 for icmp and the static ip of your xbox 360. 
all guides i have read says i should open these ports for tcp and udp, that did not solve it for me. 
just figured this out and have not testes what port made it work. 
all games that did not work online works perfect now! 
right now i have all those ports open for tcp, udp and icmp.
