to each his own. 
anyway, i found a nice card at newegg- winfast tv2000 xp expert by leadtek. 
does everything i need in both xp and mandrake. 
good image and comes with a remote. 
selling now at newegg for $45us with .99 shipping. 
if i were building a high-end pvr, i might go to a more expensive unit, but for everyday, this one is good.
