i have the exact same problem. 
nobody seems to have any answers. 
i can boot the system with a dos floppy disk just fine. 
but once i'm in xp (home edition), i get &quot;the system cannot find the drive specified&quot;. 
i have tried *everything* (except doing a complete re-format and re-install of the os, which i don't want to do). 
i'm at service pack 2, but this problem started a couple months before i installed sp2.
