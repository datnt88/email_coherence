bob, i updated the driver for - d-link dwl-g520 pci wireless card (802.11g) from windows update while the driver and firmware for d-link dwl-650 wireless 2.4ghz (802.11b) cardbus adapter were updated to the latest version when the setup, which i downloaded from the d-link site, is run. 
now the: but after sometime the connection just seems to dies out and the host computer (desktop pc) will alternatively flash the wireless connection is not available or connection is excellent. 
all this time the laptop will suggest the connection exit with 'no signal'. 
this has stopped. the connection status confirms the connection made with the laptop and is stable. 
although, i cannot access internet from the laptop nor can i ping the desktop from my laptop. 
any more suggestions? 
regards, hiren mehta
