how about that, since this is my first lcd desk top and i have never owned a lap top i didn't know they made the screens in gloss finish like the old crt's huh. 
i started to look around on camera web sites and it seems the industry standard is lacie, eizo or nec. 
they all make models w/ caliberation software but they are all very pricey. 
i don't think i'll be buying a 30&quot; any time soon unless i hit the lottery. 
i live 20 min north of nyc and they have one of the largest camera shops in the world there. 
i'm going to call them next week to see if they have any of the units set up for a look see. 
i'll keep you up to speed on my selection.
