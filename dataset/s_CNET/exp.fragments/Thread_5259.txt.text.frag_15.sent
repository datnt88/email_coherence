something similar happened with my desktop recently and mind you a techy thought there was corrupted file; reset to factory defaults; turns out there was a short in the dvd drive causing power fluctuations, actually zapped and killed my external back up drive; so new dvd burner/drive was all that was needed; wasted time, lost files, photos.
