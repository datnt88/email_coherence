i have had my emachines t6420 for almost exectly 24 months. 
motherboard is having problems. 
i can't restart and usb mouse drops out all the time. 
also video jumping around. 
a friend of mine who owns a computer support business did a remote on my machine and thinks a bad capacitor on the motherboard is the culprit. 
he says this is common in emachines and dell optiplex. 
emachines support is completely useless. 
what a bunch of total idiodts. 
their answer to everything is to do a full system restore. 
i have no doubt they knew of ms-7207 motherboard problems long ago and continued to sell these crappo units. 
anyway, here is my question. 
i am going to replace my ms-7207 motherboard but i have noticed that it comes in two versions. 
one with the nvidea geforce 6100 chipset and the other version with the nvidea geforce 6150 chipset. 
does anyone know if the 6150 chipset motherboard is compatible in the t6420? 
in other words would it operate on the same drivers and bios and would i be able to use the same restore disk? 
if yes then i intend to get this board instead of the original because it offers dvi out connections for monitor. 
thanks, strat100
