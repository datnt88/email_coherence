&quot;at this point i have a choice. 
my choice would be to plug in the usb zip and see if microsoft will get the driver for me.&quot; --i guess i should have read more. 
--microsoft did not get the driver for me. 
tried before aro 2012 was used. 
--too late to boot in safe mode now. 
--i found dell has discontinued support for my dimension 5150 computer. 
--naturally and logically i was seeking the drivers using the computer on which they were required. 
no reason to think otherwise. 
back to my issues. 
obviously i trusted the wrong persons somewhere. 
assuming my unsupported dell dimension 5150 computer has been screwed up, what can i do now, since it will no longer boot to windows?
