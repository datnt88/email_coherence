i've had this exact problem. 
turned out i had a cracked motherboard. 
once the motherboard heated up it would start acting up and stop working. 
let it sit and it would work again for a while. 
you might try re-seating all pci, memmory and processor. 
that could help. 
otherwise, it might be time for new pc.
