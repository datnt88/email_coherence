have you tried: 1) connecting the drive to another usb port/ another computer? 
2) connecting the drive to an e-sata port on your computer? 
3) installing the software drivers (that accompanied the enclosure)? 
4) gone to akasa'a website to see if there is an update for that particular enclosure? 
5) made sure the e-sata/ usb switch is switched to usb?
