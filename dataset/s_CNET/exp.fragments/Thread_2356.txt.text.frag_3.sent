i updated the firmware and the system doesn't drop connectivity like used to. 
now it will lose the connection momentarily but i don't have to reset the router to get it to reconnect it will do it on it's own. 
it is pretty quick, windows live signs out put skype never shows that it is disconnected and the internet will kinda &quot;hang&quot; when it happens and i usually have to refresh the screen or hit the back button. the internet in general is also running a lot slower and jumpy than it has before i updated, it has a hard time with videos which was never the case before. 
i'm going to try and switch to wireless g only as you suggeseted by my renter has a wireless n laptop, will this affect her connectivity if i'm just broadcasting in g? the prior issues seemed to happen with the most frequency at night with my laptop which is upstairs and the desktop and router are in the basement. 
the logs don't have any dhcp errors, it does show quite a few blocked incoming tcp packets with a &quot;ack recieved but there is no active connection&quot;. 
i don't know what nat tables are to see if they are full or overloaded.
