hello all, i have the thermaltake 760i bigwater cooling system on my pc, and have been keeping an eye on operating temps recently. 
in an air-conditioned room, it seems to idle around 46c, and under high load can get into the high 60'sc. 
this seems a bit high to me compared to what other people with liquid cooling, some even with high-perf. 
fans, have been reporting. 
does this sound like an indication of a failing/failed pump to anyone?
