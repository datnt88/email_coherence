i had no trouble with the card until i had a fault delvelope with my dsl connection back in oct/nov last year. 
i didn't know there was a fault till last saturday but complained to isp hundreds of times so is looks as if what setting were there originally got wiped back then as i had to re-install windows and several other bits then ... didn't notice usb card until recently. the dsl modem is in the original usb port on the pc. this was originally an me pc ... everything plugged into the usb pci card is working okay, even my printer which is why i don't understand what is happening. 
cheers for trying anne
