i always use this stupid way to solve my hardware connection problems and it always work. 
go to add hardware and click &quot;yes that the hardware is connected&quot;. 
it will list you all the hardwares those you mentioned &quot;working properly&quot;. 
highlight that hardware and click next and finish. 
it will go to the troublesthooting menu and will guide you step by step. 
i have the same problem with my computer in my office. 
it fails to read some hardware sometimes and it always said working properly.
