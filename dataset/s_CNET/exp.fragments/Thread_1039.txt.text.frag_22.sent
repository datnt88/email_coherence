your monitor uses a lot of power- so i turn it off, and for the good of all humankind, i run as much of the world community grid distributed computing program as i can - i have multiple old computer that just chug away finding cures for clean water, better ways to build photo-voltaics, cures for hemorrhagic fevers, looking for cures for various kinds of cancer, finding the best way to stop malaria, -- etc. so while i sleep, my comptuers, some too old to hold today's programs, chug away crunching numbers looking for a better and brighter tomorrow-- so far i think wcg has done about 500,000 years worth of calculations - not mine alone, but a bunch of us together who know that for a penny or two or three a day, we can perhaps save untold human suffering, and help stop the wail of a starving child as it's mother looks on helpless in the face of multi- and trans-national corporate greed. 
my machines fight fascists and capitalists! 
--- while they look for a better, brighter, tomorrow!
