you described your original cpu as core 2 duo but not the new one. 
just wondering if it was. 
if it isn't, that is why you aren't getting the results you want. 
also check the motherboard specs and make sure the newer cpu is supported. 
sometimes in the past i have tried upgrading to a larger cpu even when the motherboard supported it and didn't help performance much at all or caused the whole system to become unstable. 
you may have had the most stable combination already for your build. 
that is not much for help but thought i would let you know that it does happen alot.
