i had such a pin break and since the monitor was only going to be around another year i fixed it by find a replacement pin of about the same diameter (actually 2x larger) and was about 3 times the length of the pin you can see. 
with a stiff pair of needlenose pliers i was able to push the new pin into and beside the broken pin's remains in the connector housing. 
it was stiff enough to not keep going through and out the other side and completed the connection. 
cost? 
nothing.
