and sometimes even *other* d-link adapters. 
first, do you have a static or dynamic ip address? 
if dynamic, you may need some info from your isp. 
anyway, you may want to try this, reset the router per d-link's instructions (normally a little button you have to push, sometime with something like a pencil point). 
open up internet explorer, and under tools&gt;internet options&gt;general tab, left click the delete files button in the middle to get rid of any cached router addresses. 
re-setup router per the instructions. 
then go through the setup page. 
did the router and sony ever communicate with the 'net? 
sometimes doing a repair of your lan connection will fix it, and check to see if the xp firewall is enabled.
