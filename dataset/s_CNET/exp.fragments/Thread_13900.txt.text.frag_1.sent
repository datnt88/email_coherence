here is the deal. 
i have a 750gb hard drive running windows xp pro that seems to have cratered. 
i attempted a restart after removing a program and it gave me a bsod. 
when i attempted to restart in safe mode, it locked up on the mup.sys. 
i had this happen once before and was able to resolve it by booting from the recovery discs. 
however, this time, when i went to boot from the recovery discs, it would not even do that. 
i removed the disc and was going to retrieve the important files i had created since my last backup by placing it in a hdd enclosure and attaching to another computer, but when i do, the primary partition asks to be formatted before use and shows 0 bytes used. 
does anybody have a good idea of how to proceed? 
thanks brian
