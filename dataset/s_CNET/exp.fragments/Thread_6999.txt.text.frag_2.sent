by video performance, do you mean gaming (i think not with a 800 mhz system)? 
upgrading a video card for better &quot;video-quality&quot; is almost useless, unless your current video card doesn't support your monitors' native resolution. 
you may get more options such as brightness controls or such, but that won't warrent the money for a new card.
