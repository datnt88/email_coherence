i use a windows xp home edition, sp 2, system. 
i ran into a problem loging in. 
i don't use a password for my user account, but, i get sent to the windows login screen with my user account and picture. 
i am unable to log into my account, when i click my user name/ picture, it logs in for 1 second, then logs me out. 
there is no way for me to log in. is there a way to bypass the loginn screen and automatically log in? 
thanks in advanced.
