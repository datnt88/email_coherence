perhaps it is my fault for not stating my problem correctly. 
on my own i found a link from pc magazine that explains what i want to do but not how to do it. 
here is the link: since my familiarity with windows explorer is limited i would like some honest help with my problem. 
i like learning new things and this flash drive is a new toy i sincerely want to learn to work with.
