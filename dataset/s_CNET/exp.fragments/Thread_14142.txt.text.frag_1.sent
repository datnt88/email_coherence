alright, this may seem like a stupid question, but so far i couldn't find the answer. 
does anyone know what motherboard dell ships in an xps 410 if you select a pentium d processor? 
i know the 410 is made for core 2 duo and that the 400 was the one with pentium d, but the 400 is gone now and i don't know the motherboard in either of them. 
help?
