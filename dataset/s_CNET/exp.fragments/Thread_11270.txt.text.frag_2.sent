1. hardware issues. 
rarely any trouble at all. 
you show them the dvd not playing, they fix that. 
it doesn't power up, they fix that. 
2. software issues. 
here's where people get mad. 
repairing even what appears to be a minor issue is often done by reloading the os and since that's not a hardware failure you may get charged for that. 
if you insist they backup your files, you get charged for that. 
if you insist they fix it without reloading the os, wait, do you see a pattern developing?
