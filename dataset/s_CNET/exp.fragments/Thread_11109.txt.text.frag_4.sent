hi thanks for the replies. 
i completely formatted the hdd and installed a clean copy of windows 7 using a boot up disc. 
but now the computer is using default vga graphics and i cant get back to the hd ones i was using before which means i also cannot connect my laptop using hdmi. 
any ideas? 
thanks again
