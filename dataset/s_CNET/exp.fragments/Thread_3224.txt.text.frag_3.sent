if i would get it fixed i would probably have to do that, being i don't like to mess around with hardware. 
i'm kind of a computer dummy when it comes to that, i would be to afraid to open the power case. 
thank you for giving me some advice though on what to do. 
do you know how much this would cost in the end? 
would that be expensive to do? 
thank you for your help.
