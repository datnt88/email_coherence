i put this request under &quot;desktops&quot; but think i had it in the wrong place, mods please feel free to delete it. 
thanks issues as follows: i have a 4 year old hp running xp. today, it would not post, and seems to be the motherboard. 
took it to a pc shop. 
they are telling me that if the replace the motherboard, they have to wipe the hard drive as the new mb would have a different chip set. 
i told them that was ok, as i have a backup drive running acronis true image that i can restore from. 
again, he said that would reinstall the prior chip set drivers. is this correct? 
so is there nothing i can do to get back my hard drive info from the backup drive when a mb is replaced? 
somehow this doesn't sound quite right. 
appreciate thoughts and help.
