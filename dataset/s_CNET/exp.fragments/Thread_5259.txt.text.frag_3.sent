i have ruled out any software related issues because it boots in less than 60 seconds if i power down and reboot. 
if it were software related it would boot slowly everytime i power down and reboot. 
btw, i keep my registry cleaned up on a regular basis and defrag my drive once a week. 
once i get past that first slow boot up in the morning, it is lightining fast for the rest of the day. 
i think the disk drive is the cause of the problem. 
i think the drive is slow to come up to speed. 
once it is warmed up it works fine.
