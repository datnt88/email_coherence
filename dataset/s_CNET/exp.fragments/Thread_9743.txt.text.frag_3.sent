i don't have knowledge of either of those particular units, but i've had luck with very similar adapters. 
i've never had a problem with disconnections. the link was always solid. 
just remember to plug it directly into the wall and not into a surge protector or power strip. 
surge protectors will interfere with these devices, and you will very likely have issues if you don't plug it directly to the wall outlet. 
tp link and trendnet are both trustworthy to me; i own networking gear from both companies. 
i would recommend just relying on the reviews and be sure to purchase from a place with a good return policy should anything not work correctly.
