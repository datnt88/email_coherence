most motherboards sold now have an agp slot and a pcie slot. 
so you can have an agp card for now, and when you want to upgrade, migrate to a pcie card. 
why would you still want an agp card? the only reason i see is cheaper price. 
all the latest technology is for pcie, but if you don't need the latest and greatest, you can save yourself a little bit of money. 
radeon 9600s are pretty cheap nowadays.
