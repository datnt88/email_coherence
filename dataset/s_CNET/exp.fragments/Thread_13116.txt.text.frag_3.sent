&quot;try this. 
turn off the router then turn on the extender. 
now reboot the pc and see if it picks up the extender and try the setup per the instructions. 
at some point you can configure the extender and tell it how to connect to the wifi router.&quot; the extender has a power plug and a ethernet cable. 
i might sound stupid, but i can see the extender in my wireless connections, but it fails to connect... if i turn off the router where do i plug the ethernet cable into? 
i have been able to access it before but for some reason it stopped working and i cannot access it. 
i usually access it by plugging the ethernet cord into the back of the router, then just type in the ip address.
