i need to find a graphics card that is 200.00$ or less. the card can be agp or pci. the card must run autodesk inventor 11 perfectly. 
autodesk lists all certified graphics cards on their website and i must have one that is 100% green on the list. the other requirement is that the card must be a killer gaming card. 
i want to run games like oblivion and age of empires 3 on the maximum settings with all of the shading and smoke and everything. 
so i ask you... can it be done? 
what card should i buy? 
if you know of one that is more than 200$ please mention it anyway. 
perhaps i can find a used one.
