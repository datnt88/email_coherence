your response was very helpful thank you. 
i will go to radio shack and find the splitter that you mentioned. 
with the splitter installed as you indicated, the fact that my actual tv and cable box is on the other side of the house won't be a problem right? 
is the cable signal that goes to my cable modem the same cable signal that goes to my cable box? 
you are awesome thank you so much. 
i will let you know how it goes.
