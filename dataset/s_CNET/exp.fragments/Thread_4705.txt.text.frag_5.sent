means dual inline memory module. 
that is a type of chip technology, regular sdram are also are in dimms. the dimms are the chips that are mounted to the memory stick. the memory stick, is actually a small six layer circuit card with the artowrk to get the signals to and from the dimms and the pins on the memory stick that connect to the slot on the mobo. 
ddr sdram sticks have 184 pins [connections] while sdram 168 pin. 
and yes! both are forms of sdram [synchronous data random access memory]. 
ddr is simply dual data rate sdram. 
two reads per clock.
