the link you provided was for some pci card but we need to be sure the mainboard chipset drivers are current. 
what's on the xp or 2000 cd may get the os working but you often find usb inoperable. 
&quot;how would i determine the version of chipset drivers? 
where would i find updates? 
how would a go about applying such updates?&quot; 
see the link at the top of this post. 
and the versions are in the device manager. 
which i don't bother checking when the owner doesn't know. 
it's my clue to just get the latest and move forward.
