hi, i have a dell dimension 4600 purchaed 1 1/2 years ago. 
about 2-3 weeks ago, i installsed a 200 gb maxtor 7200 ata 133 in the machine in addition to the 40gb original drive. 
a week later, the system acted funny by making a sound (hd) and giving me the follwoing message: primary drive 0 not found, strike the f1 key to continue, f2 key to run the setup utility. the following morning the system worked fine. 
a couple of days ago it came up with the message but it did not work in the morning. 
i moved the controller wires around but no luck. 
any idea how i can get my machine working? 
at this time i will be happy with having access to my original drive!! thanks tinman6g
