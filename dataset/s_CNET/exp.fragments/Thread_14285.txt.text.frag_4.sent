oh no, poor &lt;dvmarion&gt;, that is bad luck... i heard that from many people don't get hp computers coz they are not good.... @serena_va - have you brought the mc101 you mentioned at the end? 
i just brought one as well and i got the barebone version, so that i can add my own os and storage. the device works really well, the trinity doing it job well, is really fast and the graphic is brilliant, no problem with online games. 
i got 2 tb hdd so that i can storage series and movies i downloaded from internet. 
i like it very much so far, think is a good choice! 
good luck to you.....n maybe not hp as &lt;dvmarion&gt; mentioned lol &lt;/dvmarion&gt;&lt;/dvmarion&gt; &lt;dvmarion&gt;&lt;dvmarion&gt; &lt;/dvmarion&gt;&lt;/dvmarion&gt;
