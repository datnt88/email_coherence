hi, i will try contacting them but are they free because the laptop is 3 years old and out of warranty. 
i did try installing the motherboard drivers and then the display drivers but i started getting the blank screen like before so i had to go into safe mode and take them off. 
now my computer is using just default vga display drivers. 
thanks again everyone for your help
