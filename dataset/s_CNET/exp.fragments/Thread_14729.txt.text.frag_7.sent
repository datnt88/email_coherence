i have another block of time away coming but i thought i'd give some more food for thought. 
i have my tv set up as the secondary monitor for home theater purposes. 
s-video hook up. 
usb sound through my audio receiver. 
the corruption is the same on tv as on monitor. 
just thought you should know. 
it does get worse substantially when playing a movie recorded from cable tv, whether on tv or monitor. the corruption might appear on the desktop but not be on a thunderbird e-mail page or open office word processing page or even this firefox web page. 
have tried all cooling except the household fan so far. 
videos streaming online like (hilarious by the way) play without corruption. 
could my power supply have something to do with it? 
i've heard plenty about people that have problems and/or burnout. 
mines a 485w but not a big name. 
i don't know much about voltages. 
they don't seem to match but i don't know the acceptable ranges. 
here's another temp and a voltage report. 
temperatures: motherboard 32 c (90 f) cpu 54 c (129 f) seagate st3200822a 36 c (97 f) seagate st3300831as 34 c (93 f) cooling fans: cpu 2679 rpm voltage values: cpu core 1.66 v aux 1.52 v +3.3 v 3.17 v +5 v 4.89 v +12 v 11.86 v -12 v -12.03 v -5 v -5.15 v +5 v standby 4.97 v vbat battery 2.62 v any of this help?
