i've been looking at tablets for quite along time now and i happen to come across these awesome deals. the only thing is i cant decide on which one is the best. 
office depot has the google nexus 7 32gb for $240. 
they have the asus transformer pad 32gb for $300. 
they also have the samsung glasaxy tab 2 10.1 16gb for $300. 
and lastly they have the samsung galaxy tab 2 7&quot; 16gb for $170. 
i would like to use a tablet for school and use the polaris office to type documents. 
i would use it to play games often. the design and feel of the tablets does not bother me, but i would rather like to have a 10 inch tablet. 
just please give me some insight on what is the best deal and which one would be best.
