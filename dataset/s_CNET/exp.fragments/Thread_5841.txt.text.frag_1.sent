using nero 5 with a dvr 106 i got a &quot;internal target failure&quot; after looking into the problem i thought the drive had gone down. 
however after buying a dvr 110 i cant get it to read a disc it doesn't even spin up after i put it in. 
could it be a pioneer problem as i have another drive that works fine a dvdr/ cdrw. 
any help
