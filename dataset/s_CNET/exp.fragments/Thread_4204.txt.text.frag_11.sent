bios update, you need to check and verify what the current bios level is and compare to what the latest one is. 
that way, you see if there is a huge gap, you will need to update. 
while any bios update can potentially make your pc a brick, it will also if properly done, provide the greatest latitude of cpu to install. 
bios updates were released just for that purpose besides any other glitches or corrections they did. 
of course, you can buy the cpu and install and take it from there. 
however, if you get some cpu that &quot;suppose to work&quot; and doesn't generally speaking the bios update will more than likely correct that. 
in that case, you have to remove the new cpu return the old one and then bios update and when completed then install the new cpu. it would help that the support website provide what a bios update corrects or adds to the bios, but too often that is negated or very sparse. 
bios update: adds more cpus to recognize, handle ram better, correct glitches, mtrbd. 
options increased/eased among other things. 
if all this is greek to you, then allow someone locally to explain it all. 
i can only point you in the right direction and then you decide. 
i refrain from providing pc 101 courses.
