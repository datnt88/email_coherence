comcast has been using dhcp to assign addressing for a long time. 
i used to be able to get 3 public addresses if i connected 3 pcs to my switch that was connected to the comcast cable modem. 
i had a linksys wrt54g that worked well for a while. 
i decided to migrate over to my cisco 831 but could not get the wan ethernet to come up. 
i finallt had the idea to shut down the linksys and then reboot the cisco. 
suddenly the cisco was working. 
when i powered up the dlink, it would no longer get a dhcp address. 
it seems comcast has found a way to limit users to 1 ip address using dhcp. 
in a nutshell, every router should work. 
it is just a matter of the proper config.
