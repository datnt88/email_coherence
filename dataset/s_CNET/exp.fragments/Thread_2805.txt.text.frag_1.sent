i just bought a new 120 gig seagate harddrive, (it is the &quot;e:&quot; drive on my machine); and i transferred bunch of .wav and .mp3 
files to it from c: drive. 
when i play the files back, it's like i'm back in lp record land. 
clicks and pops all over. 
(the files sound fine when played off the c: drive.) anyone have any idea what is causing this? is this a defective drive? 
i tried xferring files one at a time, no help - fj
