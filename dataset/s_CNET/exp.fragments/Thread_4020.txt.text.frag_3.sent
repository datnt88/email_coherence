the cpu is non-refundable but i could upgrade the card later on... but would the 6600gt be able to handle 1080i? 
i'm just wondering if the pinnacle requirements were exaggerated in any way. 
also, i've put together all my parts now, but i'm not sure what to do next. is it time to install windows? 
if so, do i just pop the cd in?
