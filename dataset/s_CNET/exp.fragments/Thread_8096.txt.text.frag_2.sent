scripts threads turn the pc on if you still get diagnostic lights 3 and 4, then either one or all of the memory is bad. 
you can start the process of elimination by removing the memory from the black sockets, power on. 
then replace those and remove the memory from the white sockets, power on. 
you get the idea. 
once you ascertain what memory is bad, you can then replace it.
