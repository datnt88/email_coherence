i feel so embarassed. 
i have searched high and low for a straight answer but i can't seem to work out how to create a home wireless network in my house. 
i don't know whether it's so easy it's not published anywhere or whether i'm missing something or what but i can't find what i think i'm looking for and it's so common i feel embarassed. 
so i turn to you guys. 
apologies if you think i'm an idiot but please help me out, i am for real. 
i have a pc running windows xp upstairs with a wireless adapter. 
if a machine is to act as like a server then this is the one i'd want it to be. 
downstairs i have a netgear wireless router which is plugged into my dsl line, acting as the modem my crappy isp gave me for free. 
with an ethernet cable i have my xbox plugged in to this. then i also roam the house with a laptop running windows vista. 
oh and my flat mate also has a laptop running windows xp. all i want to do is set up a home network, wireless of course, that enables me to see all devices (pc, laptop, and xbox) on the network, from each machine. 
i want to be able to transfer files between machines over the network and be able to communicate with my xbox from my pc or laptop. 
i would also like my flat mate to be able to tap into the network when he likes so we can transfer files between our computers. 
i plan on hooking up a printer to the router at a later stage for shared printing too. 
that's it. 
that's all i want to do. is that so hard? 
so what i'm after is a step-by-step guide on configuring this. 
if someone could point me in the right direction i would be eternally grateful. 
thanks for your time
