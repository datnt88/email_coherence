01) can anyone recommend a good monthly cell provider coverage for a built-in 4gwimax cellular chip that is in a laptop i am thinking of purchasing? 
02) i was told that with a built-in 4gwimax cellular chip that if i am not a light user that there will be bandwidth caps. 
what are bandwidth caps and how do i get around them? 
03) if the laptop i decide to purchase has a 4gwimax cellular chip already installed and i have a monthly contract with a provider, will i be able to connect to the internet anywhere/anytime?
