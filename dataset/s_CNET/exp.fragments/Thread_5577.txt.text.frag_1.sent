i have a verizon westell adsl2 + router model a90-7500-07 combination. 
it has been replaced by verizon 4 times and yes it works ok when wired. if i try to connect with my iphone, ipad or book reader 1 in 10 times it connects, or randomly. 
i have changed settings and channels. 
i have turned off all security and it still doesn't connect. 
my question is there a modem/router that i can buy myself, say at staples that works well. 
verizon tells me that none will work (will not connect to their dsl) i can't imagine that being true. 
can anyone help me? 
thanks
