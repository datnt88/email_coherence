guidance and advice please: i have a rather old desktop, with pc2100 2600 mhz ddr memory. 
i cannot find a good deal for this obsolete memory, but i can find many good deals for later ram versions such as pc2700 or later versions. 
question: will a pc2700 ddr memory card work when installed into the memory slot of my desktop's motherboard? 
thank you in advance for any advice, thank you.
