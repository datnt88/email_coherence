you might want to download &quot;easyclean&quot; without quotes. 
the reason is every time you have updates from microsoft it keeps all those updates in your registry and it has to keep going through all those updates when you boot up. 
after downloading use on the unnessary folder only to remove all the unnessary files. 
click on the first three to place a check mark in the boxes. 
then when that is finished it unclick the first three then click on the remaining boxes. 
do not be alarmed when it takes some time for it to complete. 
have had over 200,000 unnessary files in just a week of being on the net. 
this is a great progam. 
have advised others to use it and they are having a lot of sucess with it. 
you may also want to add more memory to your system. 
you should have at least one gig for today's use. 
have three computers and the least i have is 2 gig. 
easyclean is a free program you there is no charge for it but the creator of the the program is asking of donations. 
good luck and god bless you.
