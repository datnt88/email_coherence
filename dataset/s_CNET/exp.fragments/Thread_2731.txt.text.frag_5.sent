first swap video cards. 
you didn't specify if it was a crt or not and i'm not familiar with techmedia. 
if it is a crt unplug the power cord and take the back off. 
on the neck of the crt itself is a small pcb (circuit board)carefully unplug the pcb from the neck of the crt. 
you will see a partial to full circle of solder joints. 
these are the filaments to the crt. 
after a period of time these solder joints can become poor. 
as the display heats up, it causes a fracture of the joint (thermal fracture) resolder and give it a whirl. 
you can also check them before you do anything by taking the back off and power up your system. 
turn all lights off and you should see a &quot;glow&quot; in the neck of the crt. 
if the &quot;glow&quot; is there, then it is not the filaments.
