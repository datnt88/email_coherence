question: video card performance deteriorated in a short period of time, please help! 
several months ago i installed an ati radeon sapphire hd3850 agp graphics card in my aging windows xp machine to give it more gaming oomph. the card features 512mb of ddr3. the performance improved immediately. 
i was able to play bioshock and call of duty 4 at 1,440x900 pixel resolution without a hiccup. the graphics were smooth with no lag or jerkiness. 
suddenly, now the games don't run well at all. the motion is choppy and the response to mouse or keyboard commands lags. 
i tried adjusting the game settings to lower resolution and shutting off some of the shadowing etc., but the problem persists. 
i am running an intel p4 3.0 ghz processor with 3 gigs of ram. the video driver is up to date. 
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
im tired of pulling out my hair on this. 
(i have very little left anyway . 
thank you in advance for your attention and consideration.
