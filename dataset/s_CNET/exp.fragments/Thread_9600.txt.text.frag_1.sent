hey everyone. 
every time i plug something with removable storage into my laptop (ipod, digital camera with memory stick), the laptop doesn't recognise it in my computer. 
in device manager, it says it's there and working properly, but i can't access it, like can't get to my photos from dsc. 
help?!?!
