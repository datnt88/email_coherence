i have an xbox 360 elite and unfortunately i also have a netgrear rangemax model # wnr834b v2 wireless router. 
my router isnt recognizing my 360. 
when i first bought the router the two worked fine. 
for some reason it stopped. 
i called microsoft and they tell me that its the router. 
i called netgear for tech support and im told that i have to pay for that support. 
im not. 
could anyone help me reconnect? 
pleeeaase!
