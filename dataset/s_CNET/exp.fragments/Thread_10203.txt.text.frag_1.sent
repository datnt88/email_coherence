i'm trying to connect a small network with a larger network over a span of about 210ft. 
i think the device i need on the larger network is called a wireless bridge. 
what i don't know is what the device is called on the smaller network.. also will i be able to establish a connection over the 210ft span? 
windows os on both. 
thanks in advance for your help b
