xp home started with logitech optical mouse in the serial port with adapter. 
no red light and pointer did not move. 
steps i have taken taken to make it work. 
removed logitech mouse and installed the original mouse with out the adapter, that did not work either. 
also checked for bent pins (ok) reinstalled the logitech on a open usb. it worked. the mouse worked fine yesterday but not today. 
i would like to find why it did not work and how to fix. 
thanks joe
