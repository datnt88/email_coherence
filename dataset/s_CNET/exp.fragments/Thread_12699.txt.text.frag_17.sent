when you do the reinstall, choose the archive and install option. 
if you do not do that, all your data will go away. 
archive and install will preserve your data and put it back where it belongs on completion of the install. 
i realize you are already at 10.3.9, that's why i said that you would have to update the os from 10.3 (which is the os that is on the installation disk) to 10.3.9 good luck.
