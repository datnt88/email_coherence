hello, i have a computer from about 97 and then a brand new one i purchased this year. 
i installed xp on the old one recently and all it did was install over all my old files which is not what i wanted. 
so now i want to format it because is beginning to run slowly. 
i have about 400-500 mp3's that i do not want to lose. 
i have a cd burner on the old pc but it can not burn in dvd format like my new pc. 
so i'm trying to figure out some way i can do this. 
(the cheapest way) both computers have ethernet cards so i could connect them together. 
what cords would i need and could someone explain the process. 
any help would be greatly appreciated.
