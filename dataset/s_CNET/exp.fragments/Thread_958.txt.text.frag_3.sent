i picked these based on my preference since you didn't indicate your preferences. 
this particular case does not come with fans for cooling but at $26 for the case and 430watt you can afford fans. 
it takes up to 4 fans to keep your mainstream products at a optimal temperature. 
i have an it classmate that has 1 of these cases with a p4 installed. 
this case is for gamers who like a flashly looky cases to show off. 
it comes with 430 watt p/s and 1 fan. 
you can install 2 extra 80 mm fans in the rear. 
i picked this 1 as an option because it comes with a p/s (420 watt) and its a professional looking entry-level server case. 
and best of all, unlike to other cases, its aluminum when means dissipate heat better. 
it only comes with 1 fan but you get another 80mm fan and still make your $70 budget. 
however with the $10 shipping fee, you will spend a little more than intended. 
this is just another professional looking case that would make a good option. 
i hope that this gives you some idea of what you can get. 
for a $70 budget the options are almost countless, especially if you're enthusiastic about it. 
all of these came from newegg.com. 
just take a look on there. 
in the future, you will get a lot more useful help if you provide some indication of how the parts will be used, as in, for gaming, home entertainment, or office or server use. 
oh yeah, i kind of figured that the antec case that you were considering is the antec solution series mid-tower case w/350 w ps. for the price of that case i don't see anything special. 
it's a basic case. 
its made out of steel. 
it does not come with fans (i have 1 system with this case.) and lastly, 350 w is rather limited when you add future upgrades as a factor. 
its a decent case but would be better if it came with a larger ps and was aluminum. 
thats my opinion of it but i'm a semi-gamer and i like to loaded systems. 
good luck.
