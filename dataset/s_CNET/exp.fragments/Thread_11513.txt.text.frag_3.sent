thanks for answering... but i do not think this is the problem... in the company's website, they said that the 2.0 usb driver was not needed for win 2k and xp... only for win98... so i think i already have 2.0 in my os.... is there a way to check? 
i couldn't find any info in device manager... besides, i forgot to mention that in nero, at one time, i was able to chose only between 4x and 52x writing speed... but i couldn't chose 52 because my cdr's are designed for 48 max... anyways this soon was over because i couldn't chose anymore, it was back to 4x only! 
i'm goin nuts!!! what's goin on!? oh and another problem, i cant format my cdrw with incd, it won't read... maybe smashing the thing against a walll would do the trick.... no? :(please help!
