i'm considering selling some used hard drives. 
i want to make sure the information on those drives can never be recovered. 
besides completely destroying the drive with a power drill, is their a way of erasing the information, that's just as effective? 
i have a program that writes all zeroes to the drive. 
(takes 1 - 5 hours) but is this good enough? 
what is this i hear about programs that write all zeroes, 3, 7, even 35 times?
