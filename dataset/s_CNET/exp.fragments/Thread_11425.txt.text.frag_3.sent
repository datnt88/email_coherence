workaround to work around this issue: 1. click start, click control panel, and then double-click display. 
2. on the settings tab, click advanced, and then click the troubleshoot tab. 
3. move the hardware acceleration slider to none, and then click to clear the enable write combining check box. 
4. click ok, and then click ok. note: this procedure prevents the display driver from programming the hardware incorrectly, but results in a loss of some display functionality and performance. 
although you can increase the hardware acceleration settings to a point above none to regain functionality and performance, this increases the chances of the issue reoccurring.
