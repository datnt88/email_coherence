a 1700+ to run at a memory speed of 133 mhz. the system is still running fine but at only 129 mhz memory speed. 
with spread spectrum enabled it would only run at118 mhz. 
have you tried using the manual settings in the bios?? just increase the memory bus one mhz at a time starting from 100 [i assume that you have pc 133 memory], and save and exit. the only problem is that when you get to a speed that it can't handle, you may have to reset the bios, which is the shorting of the two solder fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads on the mobo with a screwdriver. 
once you find the highest speed that it will run stable at, you may find that for any type of &quot;bad&quot; shutdown, the system will boot up into the bios with thbe setting back at 100 mhz. 
then simply set it back to the speed that works. 
remember when this mobo was designed and qualified the 1700+ and later cpu's did not exist, so there was no way that the mfr could verify what the maximum speed a specific mobo would support. 
there was a later version of the mobo. 
it was confusinng because they simply added another dot after the 1.05 vrsion number. 
that version seems to have supported later cpu's. 
as willy said, make sure that you have the latest bios.
