i currently have a linksys b router. 
i have a linksys wireless g laptop card. 
my speed, range and connectivity are very low (12%). 
i was wondering if upgrading my router would help with this issue? 
which should i upgrade to - wireless g or the newer wireless n? should i stay with linksys since that is what the laptop card is? 
i noticed that linksys has wrt54gt, wrt54g and wrt54gs. is one better than the other? 
thanks so much. 
it is really hard to get this info.
