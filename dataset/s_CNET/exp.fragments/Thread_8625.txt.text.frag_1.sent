hi all. 
i would like some opinions to settle a debate i am having with my brother. 
i have an amd phenom ii x2, black edition 3.1ghz, my brother has the phenom ii x4 965 3.4ghz. 
i am happy with the cpu but he insists that upgrading to a 965 quad core would improveeverything! 
from all the info. 
i have read on numerous tech sites the only real advantage to having multiple cores is more efficient multi-tasking. 
i rarely have more than a game running, web browser and maybe word at the same time and i switch between these without a problem. 
apart from the speed increase is there a really good reason why i should upgrade my cpu? 
if i see any good reason to upgrade i am more than willing to do it.
