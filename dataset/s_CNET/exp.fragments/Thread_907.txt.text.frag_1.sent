i have a generic usb hub which installs correctly, but when i attatch certain devices to it (my usb tv tuner or cruzer micro flash drive), device manager no longer recognizes the hub, says it's an unknown device. 
however, the hub works fine with other devices, like my logitech mouse and gamepad. 
if i unplug the hub from my laptop and the devices that screw it up from the hub and then plug just the hub back in, it works fine again, but sometimes has to reinstall the driver. 
so why does the hub work with some devices and not others? 
it has enough power and all devices work on my onboard usb ports... (hp pavillion laptop, vista)
