we have networks of hardware controls so we emulate this on our test rigs. 
given how perilous setting up a single laptop would be and that it would be an emulation of the real thing we don't do what you propose. 
but if i was to do this i would be looking at route tables, masks and such. 
and there's the rub. 
most folk can't alter a route table. 
i know it took me years to learn this. 
i mean i could issue the command but until i was on that router software dev team i didn't understand it because i didn't have to. 
fast forward to your setup. it may take time for you to pound out what your apple's route table looks like for this one.
