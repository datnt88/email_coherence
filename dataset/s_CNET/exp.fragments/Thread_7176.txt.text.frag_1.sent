whenever i play dos based games and games like nfs most wanted and gta vice city, my pc's cpu usage goes up to 100% and cpu fan produces a lot of sound. 
this does not happen when i use other apps. 
atlast, the system turns off. 
i have a pc with pentium iv processor 512 mb ram, 80 gb hd, d101ggc motherboard please help me with some solutions.
