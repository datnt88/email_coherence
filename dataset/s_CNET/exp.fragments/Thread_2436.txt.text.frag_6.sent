1) checked firmware version, seems to be a version higher than what is downloadable from linksys site (version says 3.01.3 but highest on linksys seems to be 2.2) 2) could you elaborate please? 
i dont quite understand that. 
but i am fairly sure i dont know the 'rules' &gt;2. 
vpn can stress many since they don't realize &gt;the &quot;rules&quot;. 
if you are on a vpn to work, you won't &gt;see your lan... 3)there only needs to be one off site computer connected to the vpn. 
so a non vpn router should work alright... right? 
4) only firewall known to me is the default windows firewall with sp2. 
i am also confused as to how to actually open the files on the computer once the vpn is connected. 
sidenote: it seems now that when i connect to the vpn from one computer (on the same network already) that the other computers have a hard time browsing the network, they can still connect but cant browse, the error message comes up network unavalible.
