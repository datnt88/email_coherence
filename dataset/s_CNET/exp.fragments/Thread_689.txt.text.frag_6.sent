never look at the cost of the printer. 
look at the cost of the cartridges. 
now for those two models let's look. 
epson cx9400 black t068 - suggested cost - 19.99 each color t069(1-3) - suggested cost - 13.99 ink volume t068 - 7.5ml t069 - 5ml cost per ml of black - 2.66 cost per ml of color - 2.80 canon mp530 black 5 - suggested retail - 16.25 each color (#8) - suggested cost - 14.25 ink volume black #5 - 26ml each color - 13ml cost per ml of black #5 - 0.63 cost per ml of color #8 - 1.10 now the cost per ml of color is for one cartridge. 
in my experience i would not trade in my mp530. 
photo quality is good, and the features are great. 
for the value, i would go with the canon, cause by the time you buy cartridges from epson to equal the volume of the canon cartridges you should have purchased the canon.
