hi bob- i do not have a wireless system, i am plugged in at the wall. 
re: why did i click to configure in the first place...i checked that a few days ago when on the phone with epson. 
it's the only thing that gives any type of feedback/message. 
otherwise, it's as if the printer wasn't there. 
nothing gets sent to the queue, etc. cheers - kalli
