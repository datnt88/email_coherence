stupid gateway has had my computer at their 'repair' shop a total of 3.5 months!!!! i've only owned this since august of 07! they refuse to offer me a comparable replacement or loaner... both times it came back to me, it seemed to be ok for about a week and then started rebooting again. 
going to try the bios update tonight...
