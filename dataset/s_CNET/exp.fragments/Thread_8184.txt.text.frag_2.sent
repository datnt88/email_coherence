ive got my wireless belkin going into my pc like you and my wireless goes into my modem also. 
my wifes pc is upstairs and shes also got a laptop and every thing works fine. 
i can turn my pc off whenever and internet still works fine. 
she has got wireless built into both devices though.i 
dont see no need 4 a switch as the wireless signal comes from the modem then goes through the wireless 2 her computers.you 
should have no problems mate. 
heres a link that might help.
