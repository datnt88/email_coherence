i have a lite-on dvd burner, but all programs have stopped recognising it. 
i have tried ashampoo and burnaware. 
the drive in question will read dvds and burn cds, but will not burn anything to dvd (i.e. backups, groups of files). 
i haven't added or deleted any programs over the period where it just stopped working. the drive is found in device manager as a dvd burner and is 'working properly'. 
i have updated the driver, unplugged the cable, reinstalled but nothing seems to work. 
i'm running xp/sp2. 
i have run nod32 virus scans, malwarebytes, spybot, adaware and nothing comes up as untoward so am thinking perhaps the drive is just dead, but i would've thought that it wouldn't play any disc or burn cds if that's the case. 
all help would be appreciated.
