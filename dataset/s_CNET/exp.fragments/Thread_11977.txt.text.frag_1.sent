i have taken a hard drive out of my laptop and connected to cable which had a usb plug. 
i have connected it to a desktop and it tells me it has discovered new hardware but it does not show up in my computer as a drive. 
when i unplug the cable it shows up as a drive but disappears immediately. 
what is up with this and how can i tell if there is anything on this drive to retrieve?
