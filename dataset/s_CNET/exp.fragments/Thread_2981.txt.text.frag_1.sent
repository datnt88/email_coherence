hi on evry reboot windows seems to forget my setting for the mouse wheeel scroll lines. 
i have also used tweak ui to no avail. 
i then went to the registry and changed in 4 instances the setting for it. 
user key: [hkey_current_usercontrol paneldesktop] value name: wheelscrolllines i set the lines to 4 and yet on every reboot it goes back to 1. the registry keys are set to 4 and remain at 4 after reboot though. 
this makes me conclude that [a] these locations of registry keys are useless that there must be another setting somewhere whic i don't know about. 
[c] something is over-riding all these settings (options and software). 
i also set the registry key from 'automatic) to &quot;enable wheel detection&quot; on. 
system key: [hkey_local_machinesystemcurrentcontrolsetservicesi8042prtparameters] value name: enablewheeldetection os: windows xp sp2 i've posted this problem just about everywhere for the past year or so and got no response anywhere. 
i am hoping you will not be the same. 
i also placed a search on google and all i find is my question in some of the forums i posted on. 
thank you
