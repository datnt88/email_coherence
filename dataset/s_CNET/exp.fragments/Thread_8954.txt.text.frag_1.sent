after fixing a hardware issue in my computer, i was in the process of copying files from my d: drive to my c: drive and the computer spontaneously restarted. 
it would not boot back into windows and i ended up installing/booting from my d: drive. 
back in windows, i discovered that my old primary hdd did not have any readings inside windows (disk size was 0 bytes), and when i try to browse the drive, it says it is not formatted. 
i have a backup from february 2005 but nothing since then... is there anything i can do to possibly get any information off of the drive?
