i have just bought a new laptop (hp zt 3000). 
my old desktop has win98. 
i want to go to xp on the old desktop to network the 2 more easily. 
i currently only have 96 mb of ram on the desktop with a p2-400 processor. 
i have 2 more slots open for memory on the desktop. 
i could get up to 352 mb of ram, with a 12g hard-drive. 
would this be enough to run the xp? i will also need a network card for the desktop, correct? 
i want to hook the desktop up wired, and the notebook (which already has wireless card installed) wireless. 
will i have any problems with this set up? 
thanks!
