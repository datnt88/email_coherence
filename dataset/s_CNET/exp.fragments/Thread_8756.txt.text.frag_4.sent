i have a 320 gb external hard drive. 
you can tell they are usb because the description will say usb. 
my own came with a cd with the drivers and a manual. 
i believe i had to install the drivers first before connecting the external. 
then the manual told me how to format the drive and list it in disk manager. 
i agree about the backups. 
i also use cd/dvd to backup, even though i use the external to backup as well.
