hi all. 
i'm in the market for a new amd cpu. 
i've checked out the specs on all am3 cpus from dual - quad cores. 
htpertransport features in some of the models but not all, mostly in the quad core series. 
is it worth taking into consideration if the cpu features hypertransport regardless of how many cores it has? 
thanks.
