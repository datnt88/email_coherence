hi, we've been through the windows accessibility settings and they aren't good enough. 
we live 500 miles apart. 
thanks for your reply! 
i'm going to try next a graphics forum for logitech nulooq info and then try to find a forum that would know more about speech recognition programs that william551 suggested. 
thanks all!
