i've been in the hobby of creating cardstock models for some time and previously i was using an hp businessjet inkjet printer for my models. 
unfortunately, it has a tendency to jam or not pull the paper correctly. 
so i've been looking for a replacement printer. 
most companies i've talked to about printing cardstock through their printers warn you not to. 
but i have found a printer series that actually says it will handle cardstock. 
the okidata c711 series printer lists cardstock in the range of media it can handle, see below... &quot;the c711 series from oki printing solutions quickly delivers high-quality output on a wide range of media - including card stock and banners up to 52 inches in length. 
for high-impact documents and improved workgroup performance-along with tighter controlover your printing costs and security-look to the c711 series.&quot; 
staples carries this printer on their website, so you can check out the specs. 
hope this helps, i know i'll be investing in one sometime in the future when i upgrade my machine to go from an inkjet to a laser printer.
