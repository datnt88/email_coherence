i'm hoping some networking gurus around here might be able to help me out. 
i read that if you're using coax to connect your fibetv boxes (iptv stb/pbr) up then you can plug an ethernet cable into the fibetv stb to get internet connectivity. 
i tried it with my ps3 and yes indeed i can. that saves me running a separate ethernet to my bedroom. 
while i can access the internet from my ps3 connected this way, i can't access my home's internal network. 
i would like to access my home's internal network to stream my video collection to my ps3. 
a little background to how the fibetv modem (bell modem alcatel lucent 7130 5vza2001) is setup in relation to my home network. 
i have the outside bell wire coming into the fibe cellpipe modem/router (i have the bell router disabled) and its connected into the wan port of my dlink dgl-4500 router which serves my internal home network. the cellpipe is 192.168.2.1 while my dlink router is 192.168.0.1 - is it because they are separate that i can't talk to each other? the dlink is a better router than the fibe cellpipe at routing and wifi, so i only use the cellpipe as a modem out. 
i can't actually access the cellpipe 192.168.2.1 setup page from within my home network ether, i have to physically plug an ethernet wire into the cellpipe modem to access its setup page. is there a way to get these two routers to talk to each other? 
i'd like to be able to access the cellpipe modem (192.168.2.1) setup page from within my internal home network which is connected to my dlink router (192.168.0.1) and allow devices physically connected to my cellpipe modem to access my internal home network. 
do i increase the ip range or port forward something? 
i'm just not that savy with networking - but i'm willing to learn! 
thanks,
