ok... i've changed the boot sequence to: 1. cd/dvd/cd-dr drive 2. diskette drive (though there isn't one) 3. internal hdd 4. usb storage device (there are also two (2) other non-highlighted options: cardbus nic and onboard nic) - yet, with the winxp pro disk in the drive, it pauses with a ''0 active'' in the upper leftt-hand corner and a blinking cursor beneath. 
if any key is touched, it ''beep-beeps'' once and says: ''no bootable devices - strike f1 to retry or f2 for setup utility.'' - i've tried even changing around these sequences with no results occuring. 
btw, the winxp pro disk is legit. 
i even put it in my desktop pc and it works just fine. 
- any further help is greatly appreciated. 
thanks again.
