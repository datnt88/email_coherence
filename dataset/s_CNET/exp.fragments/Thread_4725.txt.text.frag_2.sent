if you fitted the card yourself, open up the case &amp; check that everything is properly seated, properly connected, etc. as you may have dislodged something. 
remove &amp; reseat the ram modules. 
if you didn't take anti-static precautions when handling the card or touching the other motherboard components, you may have damaged something by conducting static electricity through it.
