it was a &quot;she&quot; actually! 
i just asked to set the machine up for a home network. 
she seems to have retained the work domain: is it not possible to have a domain and a home network? 
when i click my network places, i can see my school network &quot;chschool&quot; and &quot;mshome&quot; - my home network.
