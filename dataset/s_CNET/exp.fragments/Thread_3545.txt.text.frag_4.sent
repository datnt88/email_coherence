supply what it's made of, as well as who installed windows. 
i hope you understand that without details you won't get good answers or any. 
as to the windows install, knowing about the install, the drivers used and other software matters. 
for example, some may install a toxic combination. 
example at just like you, this member wanted to overclock but in the end it was the software installed that lead to the slowdown.
