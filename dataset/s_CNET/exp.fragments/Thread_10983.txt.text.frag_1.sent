good day folks, ok, i am working on a pc that delays in powering up. the system is a gigabyte ga-8ik1100 & p4 running on xp pro. 
there is a g force 5900 video card that is failing. the fans do not function and the temperature gets overheated. 
my multimeter also measured the voltage a little above 5 and 12 volts. 
the card takes 12 volts and a power error message also displays during the os boot up. 
i advised the client to buy a power supply of 480 w. i installed it and other areas of performance improved. 
i eliminated the main components as the problems. 
i also changed the battery for cmos. 
i took out the video card and put in mine and it worked instantly, but the problem still persisted after a couple of boot ups. 
that problem? 
a delay in booting up. the case wires work, but it could be a short in electricity from the front case to the motherboard. 
i cannot get into that part of the case itself. 
ok, your turn folks.......
