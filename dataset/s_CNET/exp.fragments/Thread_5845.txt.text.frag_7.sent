according to your post dell claims that the h/d is failing. 
on boot attempt no h/d was found. 
provided that all connections are correct your drive is dead. 
on a slim chance that the drive will spin up for your data recovery i posted the proceedure i use. 
this is a 50/50 chance of recovery. 
the more you attempt to use the bad h/d your data recovey decreases. 
bill comments anyone?
