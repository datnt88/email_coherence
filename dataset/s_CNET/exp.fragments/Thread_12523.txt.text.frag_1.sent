i have been transferring files over to my new computer and i made some new folders just for my turbo tax info and some very important pictures. 
now i need to reuse it ( it's already filled up) so i can finish up. 
how in the world to i overwrite, erase or otherwise reuse this thing? 
all of my previous transfers are not overwritten and therefore are copied into another file! 
it's a lexar 512 mb if that helps.thanx
