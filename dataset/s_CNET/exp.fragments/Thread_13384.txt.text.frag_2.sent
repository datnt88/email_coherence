you've found a few but the problem remains about the buyer's expectations. 
for example a few that don't know about data transfer limits want 1080p video but then are upset about the costs. 
it's currently about 1 million and a custom job. 
consumer grade stuff? 
you've seen it. 
so my question to you is why didn't you buy it?
