pentium 4s are socket 775, and while they make processors for that socket now, intel isn't planning to release any new chips for that socket in the future. 
basically, if you buy a socket 775 board now for your p4, and upgrade to a core 2 quad in january, you can do it, but you won't be able to upgrade again with the same motherboard a few years down the road. 
i suggest upgrading both now (if intel, get a core i5/i7, amd has a better upgrade path with socket am3). 
if you don't do graphics intensive things, make sure you get a motherboard with integrated graphics so you won't have to purchase a discrete card. 
just the motherboard, ram and hdd will run you at least $200 (i would suggest getting at least 4 gigs of ram, which will add another $30 or so to the price), ad a decent quad core will be at least another $150-$200. 
if you are willing to skimp a little on the cores, go for a phenom ii x3 (tri-core), as those are around $110 right now. 
never bank on resell value, pc parts become outdated in months, and with your budget, you will be probably be buying last-gen parts anyway. 
when picking parts, look at the ratings and stick with established brands (msi/asus/gigabyte for mb, western digital/seagate for hdd, crucial/ocz/kingston/corsiar/patriot for ram ...) make sure your power supply can handle the upgrade.
