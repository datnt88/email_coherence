the installation of microsoft office suite 2007 service pack 3 (sp3) failed for me repeatedly. 
i found my c: drive was low on space, so i freed some up. 
there were also multiple messages in the event log from msiinstaller saying that outlook was holding resources, so i exited outlook. 
i don't know which of these solved the problem but the sp now installed ok.
