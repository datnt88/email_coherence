one question is what processor do you have? 
if it is a celeron or sempron then you may have your computer needing more processing power which isn't the same as speed. the idea with more memory is that for memory-intensive tasks things may be done in shorter time. 
generally i don't think it'll seem that much faster. 
as for the 1486 mb recommended allocation this is likely due to windows wanting 1.5 times the physical ram which is common. 
i have 2 gb of ram and windows recommends i have 3069 mb of virtual memory that just seems unnecessary to me so i have it set to 0. regards, jb
