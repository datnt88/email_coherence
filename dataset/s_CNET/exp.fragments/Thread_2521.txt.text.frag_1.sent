i have a seagate external hd. plug into port on my comp, lights up so the powers good. 
open &quot;my computer&quot; in my windows xp(stop laughing, i know it's old). 
drive shows up but will not open. 
after many moments waiting the error message comes up: &quot;cannot open due to i/o damage&quot; i need all the info recovered as it stores pictures of a recently deceased daughter of mine. 
i'm low tech, so take it easy. 
i went to seagate website to download drivers for updating, could not even find my product! 
downloaded driver manager and it says it's not plugged in.... help - i'm confused.
