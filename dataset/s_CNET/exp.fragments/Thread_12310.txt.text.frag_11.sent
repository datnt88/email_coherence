hi bob, thanks for those links. 
i will try it. 
what do i have to lose. 
i also have this link, should i try this as well: also, i set my router to default again last night and worked on a open network. 
it was working good for an hour or two, so i assumed it was something with the security settings. 
well i spoke to soon, it began to act up again even with no security.
