kim, it seems the compaq package you described is no longer being offered at circuit city, as it is not on their website. 
same for the emachine. 
i could not find an emachine available for $419. 
you stated that the compaq had: pentium 4 processor 512 mb of ram 160 gb harddrive the emachine likely had: celeron processor 256 mb of ram 60 gb harddrive you should be looking for a computer more like the compaq than the emachine. 
you should be looking for a computer with 512mb of ram and atleast an 80gb harddive. 
these computers would work: (however the rebates on that expire in 2 days) (good buy) i reccommend these: (worth the extra money) also like you said, watch out for the emachines t6212 package deals in bestbuy and circuitcity. 
like the gateway i showed you, it's worth the extra money!. shop around and watch out for sales in the flyers on the weekends.
