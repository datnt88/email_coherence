i would like to get a computer completely for offline applications. 
i'll start with video editing (which will be a new application for me), then probably switch photo editing and word processing to it, leaving my existing machine for email and web surfing. 
i plan to get a switch for the keyboard/mouse/monitor (and speakers?) so i just have two cpu boxes sitting on the floor and one keyboard, etc. is this possible? 
feasible? 
at work even word (2003) goes to the web now whenever i click ''help''. 
i know the operating system wants to call home. 
does it have to? 
does major sotware allow mail registration? 
what other issues would i face? 
thank you! judy_m
