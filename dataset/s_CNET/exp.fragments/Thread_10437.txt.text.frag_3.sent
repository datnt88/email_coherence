ok, that makes sense. 
however, is there anyway to preserve my existing state of windows 7, as my pc being custom built i had to install a buttload of third party drivers which would be a pain to reinstall. 
does the windows backup feature selective backup where you can choose what to back up; i've never used it before. 
also, you think i need a 60gb? 
i figured 30 should be pushing it but it would be fine right?
