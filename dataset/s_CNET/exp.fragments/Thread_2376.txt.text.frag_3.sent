newegg one that i have used many times. 
included with case are 2/60mm fans to blow on the expansion cards, 1/rear 80mm fan for exhaust, add 1/120mm to the front of the case for hdd cooling and a 80mm to exhaust the top of the case. 
clear side so i do not have to disassemble the system to check for dust and grime. the largest draw back to this case is the way the front of the case moves out and down to remove. 
if the optical device is installed in the top drive bay it cannot be push back far enough due to the top exhaust fan to remove to front cover due to this out and down movement. 
to remove the top fan the power supply has to be removed. 
so on assembly i do not use the top drive bay. 
i've also found a power supply with a large belly fan conflicts with the rear fan, so look into a fan w/o a belly fan. 
do not expect a solid feeling case as you will with the $100.00+ cases. 
i prefer to cut costs at the case leaving more for the important components.
