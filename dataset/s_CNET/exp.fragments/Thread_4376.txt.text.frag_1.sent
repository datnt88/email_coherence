i need help with this file and printer sharing stuff. 
i have two computers. 1 running xp home. 
another running xp pro. 
they are connected (wire) to a d-link airplus xtreme g wireless router. 
that is connected to a surfboard cable modem connected to roadrunner. 
i finally got them both to connect to the nternet, but how do i get them to share files on each other. the main computer (we'll call it &quot;home1&quot;) has the printer connected to it. it also has 2 hd (1 has 8 partitions). 
the second computer home2 is basically my kids computer (just the essentials). 
i ran the home networking wizard on both, but i still can't see either one from the other. 
i thought this would be easier than this......:-(
