if you're going to buy a 32 bit os (like windows vista) there's no need to have more that 4 gb ram, because any more isn't being used at all. 
it's just sitting there. 
only a 64 bit os (like windows vista 64 bit) can use more than 4 gb. 
but support with drivers and games for 64 bit os'es is a little bit lacking, so i doubt if that's a good move.
