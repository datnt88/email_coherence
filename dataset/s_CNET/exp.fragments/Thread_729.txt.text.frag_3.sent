hi. what mobo are you on? 
some of them (like my abit nf7s2) will allow you to overclock athlons. 
my 2700+ is running at the same speed as a 3200+ by upping the bus from 333 to 400 and has been for 6 months. 
if you want to upgrade the processor to a worthwhile level, it will mean going to a new motherboard as well. 
for video, try an agp nvidia 6600gt. 
it really makes a difference over a 9600xt, honest. 
mine plays battlefield 2 and cs source at 1280x1024 no problems.
