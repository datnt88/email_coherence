$800 budget gaming pc from extremetech.com that may be worth having as a basis and you could pick which parts to expand like the video card that could make the cost $1,000 easily i think though don't forget about how vista figures into what you want to do. 
as for the single core vs. dual core vs. quad core, the key here is how many things do you want the computer to run at once as each core is capable of running code independent of the others. 
now there aren't many games yet that take advantage of this yet but most computers run enough things that dual core does provide a nice benefit as there are things that can run in the background like the firewall and anti-virus for example, so that the game can take advantage of the other core. 
dual-core is likely to be more common and quad core right now is pricey though some people want the latest and greatest which would be intel's quad core as amd's quad core cpus aren't out yet, though you could google up barcelona and amd and learn much more about it. 
on the motherboard the keys are which socket you want, what memory limits, overclocking abilities, size and a few other things as there are a good number of different ones.
