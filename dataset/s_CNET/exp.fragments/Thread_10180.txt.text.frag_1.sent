an ide hard drive marked as ata and one marked as ultra ata? 
my older 60 gig hd will work in my external usb-2 case but my new 160 &quot;ultra&quot; will not. 
it works perfectly in my desktop as a slave, but it will not work in my external case. 
windows (xp pro) does not notice the usb device. 
but if i put the older 60 gig drive into the case, xp sees it perfectly. 
just wondering. 
and yes, the jumpers are correct, master while in the case.
