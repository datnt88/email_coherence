i have an epson stylus color r300 and have never had a problem with generic inks. 
but i just had a bad experience with the company that sells them. 
inkjets.com. 
i ordered 2 complete sets on september 2nd and i just received them today september 19th. 
i want to warn other people. 
really poor service! the e-mail i sent them came back even though i used their web site to write to them. 
they must be going out of business. 
i'm going to find a new company since they're much more inexpensive this way. 
does anybody have suggestions?
