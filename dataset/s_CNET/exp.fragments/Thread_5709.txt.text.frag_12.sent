the reason is deeply technical and you don't get an exact division of the bandwidth. 
it's a long discussion of queuing theory, packet sizes and probability. 
in the long run it may be 1/3 for each of the 3 users but you can safely bet it will not be exact. 
and it has nothing to do with who started first. 
yes, it's a fine thing to discuss in a class room but this small space would be overwhelmed if we truly dissected how it plays out in real life. 
can we go with almost 33% for each user during long downloads?
