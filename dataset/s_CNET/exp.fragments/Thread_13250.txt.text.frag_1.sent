i've got a hd tv (hd ready (720p / 1080i) ) and i have it hooked up to normal tv, and then i have a agp cable coming from my pc (ati radeon hd 3650) to the agp port on the tv. thing is when i'm watching video on it, i get black lines moving up the screen. 
and i don't like it. 
currently i had a dvi to agp converter for the cable, but i was wondering, if i got a dvi to hdmi converter instead, and plugged into the hdmi port of the tv, would i get a better picture quality?
