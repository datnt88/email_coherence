those reasons are good. 
semiconductors have a limited life span, and heat shortens their life. 
computer monitors sometimes fail if they do not have enough ventilation as well. 
microprocessors have the same problem too. 
if a computer draws 100 watts, that adds up to about 4 dollars per month if run continuously at about 8 cents per kwhr. 
i also have only dial-up, i even use the high speed for $5 more per month because it loads pages faster and it lowers stress on internet servers, i think.
