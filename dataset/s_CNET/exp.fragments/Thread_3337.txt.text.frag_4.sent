it's an average time before failure. 
it's a tough idea to grasp that all units in the group will fail as the 10,000 hours is reached. 
the idea is simple. the usage pattern will of course help and i noted this. 
mbtf = mean time between failures. 
or on average a failure is expected (all units) on average at this time span. 
i will not define mtbf futher, but will let you research reliability and mtbf on googgle. 
i supplied a simplified example of how many hours you might expect from such usage. 
without knowing the exact make/model and its mtbf, the method i used has been more accurate in predicting the lifespan that i care to elaborate.
