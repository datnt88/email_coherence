normally you will connect the router to that source (usually a modem). the router will then do its thing, wired and wireless. 
after the router is in place you turn on file and printer sharing on each pc, but only if you want to share files and such between the two pcs. 
no &quot;server&quot; settings are involved. 
again, the source is important. 
if you get your service from another router, the above setup can be daunting.
