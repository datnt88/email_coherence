...re-creating the shared drive has made matters worse. 
now i cannot even connect to the shared drive with the ip address at the run command anymore. 
all i can connect to is some generic shared folders. 
i am completely frustrated and at a loss as to why these two machines are unable to connect on my home network. 
time to get out the sledgehammer...
