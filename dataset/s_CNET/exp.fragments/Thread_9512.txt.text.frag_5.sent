after much google searching for &quot;toshiba sd-r2002 the device, devicecdrom0, has a bad block&quot; i found: &quot;you will need to go to the device manager and open the 'dvdcd-rom drives' listing. 
you will right click on the &quot;sd-r5002 dvd-rom drive&quot; and select 'un-install' from the drop down menu. 
do this for all listed drives. 
do not re-boot on this step. 
next you will need to open the &quot;ide ataatapi controllers&quot; listing. 
you will need to right click on the bus master ide controller and select 'un-install' from the drop down menu. 
you will be prompted to re-boot, so do so. it will need to re-detect the devices and will take longer to boot. 
once it finishes it will prompt for a second re-boot. 
after that finishes, try the drive again.&quot; 
my event viewer showed the error &quot;the device, devicecdrom0, has a bad block&quot; which led to the above search and apparent fix for an older compaq presario laptop. 
it all started when i tried to run acronis true image and it failed. 
the problem has probably existed for several years because i could never &quot;burn&quot; a cd at faster than 2x.
