to cut the wattage go with a nas over 1gb ethernet and then someone's ready to use vista machine. 
integrating xp media center was bad and they only made it worse in vista. 
if you truly must build your own, set aside time to call in about driver bugs and more time as you rma parts. 
remember i can't be sure of your goal here. 
old timers loved to build things. 
today they have taken a lot of the fun out by narrowing the list of what works.
