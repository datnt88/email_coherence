i have three of them. 
these are slightly warm to the touch. 
because the cases are aluminum and not plastic, they should conduct heat better. 
they are not vented or have a fan. 
some feature cooling fins or a fan. 
my reading is that these fans are often a weakness....cheaply made...and i can believe it. 
my drives feel no warmer than the ones in my case and maybe a bit cooler. the only problem i needed to deal with is that one drive is a little slower to spin up than the rest. 
it would not always show up in windows when starting the pc. this was corrected by a bios setting which allowed some extra detection time. 
hope that helps.
