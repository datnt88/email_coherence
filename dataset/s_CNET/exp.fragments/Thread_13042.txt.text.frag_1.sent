i want to build a new pc and am looking for suggestions for specs and specific brands of motherboards etc. also where have you had the best luck purchasing components. 
i am not a gamer nor do i do a lot of high end processing and don't need a top of line speed or high end video. 
prob a dual core. 
want to do 2 hard drives. 
1 for the os (may want to do a dual boot) and 1 for evything else. 
suggestions appreciated. 
thanks
