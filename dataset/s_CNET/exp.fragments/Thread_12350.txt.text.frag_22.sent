i never thought i could have such bad luck with a hard drive company, but i have. 
i'm not sure if myself, and everyone i know, have just bought bad apples from maxtor but we have had terrible luck with them. 
i bought a maxtor drive last summer, and it is already having problems with bad blocks (several hundred... modern drives shouldn't have any... ever) and loosing partitions. 
very bad quality. 
it is a 200 gb diamond max 10 or something like that. 
my friend bought a similar hard drive, and it literally went up in smoke within two months. 
a chip burnt up on the bottom side of the drive, and obviously stopped working. 
it is under warranty, but maxtor won't replace the circuit board, so he can get his 250 gb of data off of it. 
i would recommend any hard drive that is not maxtor. 
i have had western digital drives last for years, but seagate is the best option, but is normally a little more expensive. 
it is strange that seagate owns maxtor. the best owns the worst.
