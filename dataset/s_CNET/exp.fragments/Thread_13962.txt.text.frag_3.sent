check the firefox setting and enable/disable what maybe interfering. 
you can also look into any &quot;add-ons&quot; if you use them as well. 
if definitely the browser, then delete it and reload it again, but save your favorites for later return. 
if you like try a &quot;restore point&quot; to to a date before the problem. 
if that works and later it doesn't, then some update maybe at work here. 
i exclude any system issues. 
fyi- i have firefox and it works printing whatever i deem necessary. 
this is going to be one of those problems that someone reports on and us firefox users point to a fix or you have something unique to you.
