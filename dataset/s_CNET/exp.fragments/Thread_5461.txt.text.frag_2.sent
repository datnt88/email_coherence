is extend partition 3 to include the free space at the end of partition 3. then i'd shrink/reduce partition 3 starting at the beginning of the partition (between partitions 2-3) by roughly the amount you want to add to partition 2. then i'd expand partition 2 by the free space created. 
you can do each step indivdually or build a batch. 
i prefer to do each step and check the results before going on. 
let us know.
