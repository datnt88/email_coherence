hi...our auto shutdown has had nothing to do with giving the computer a &quot;rest.&quot; it occurs no matter what we are running and when we are running it...or how much we have been using it. 
shutdowns were very random, but recently right on the hour. 
see my previous posts for how we think we have (temporarily) fixed this...by manually restarting just prior to an hourly auto-shutdown. 
we tried this on 1/15/09 and as of today, not a single reboot so far. 
computer has been perfect. 
maybe it knew we were on the verge of buying an imac. 
anyone know why this fix would work?
