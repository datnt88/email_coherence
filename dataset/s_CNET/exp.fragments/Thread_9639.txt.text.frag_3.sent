&quot;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is&quot;. 
emails, emails, what a load we all get. 
i wouldn't trust any as far as i can toss a server. 
beware laddy, its all a trap, stay clear. 
there are far, far too many pitfalls than good harbors of safety. 
check out and other websites that have a good history of selling &quot;reputable goods&quot; at respecyable but lower pricing. 
google for vendors that may offer decent pricing but beware regardless of any real cheap offering. 
also, under that xp is sold as retail package, oem, or eductional offerings. 
good luck -----willy
