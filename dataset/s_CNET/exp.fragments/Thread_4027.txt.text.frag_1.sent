hi there, please help install a new sound card. 
i have a computer running xp(home) p4, to improve its performance i have changed its power unit to 400w,and changed its video card to 256mhz . 
now i wish to install a sound card. 
it has not got a sound card at the moment, i have bought an audiophile 2496, m-audio card. 
i have been advised to disable m/b sound capacity, (m/b is matsonic, ms9327e+(usb) socket 478, sis 650gl chipset pentium 4. it's sound on board is rather good but not good enough i wish to install the pci card which i have bought. 
how do i disable the on board sound capacity? 
all help will be appreciated.
