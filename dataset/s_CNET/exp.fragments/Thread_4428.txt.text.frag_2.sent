you're going to do what you want, but i advice: 1) stick with oem ink carts until the warranty period is over 2) don't buy simply the cheapest ink refills 3) buy from a reliable source(understand return policy) 4) have on-hand the ink cart(s) to continue 5) use a &quot;cleaner cart&quot; when persistent clogs appear, if available that's about it. 
i offer that the warranty period if you use refills they can tell the difference and deny you should you want warranty work. 
it may not seem so but it does happen. 
some ink refillers aren't that keen on using the better componets and provide less than satisfactory product. 
some demanding printers like photo types tend to be very picky over time though the initial period seems ok, fails later. 
i've found basic &quot;text usage&quot; of printers seem more friendly to ink refills, but again it all depends on ink refillers.
