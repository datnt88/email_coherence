there are lots of success stories on the vendors websites. 
but when things go wrong .. or it is too dificult then the natural human reaction is to clam up and say nothing. it is only in cases where there is 'public interest' like in government or public utility does this come to the attention of the press. 
see the alabama example i cited or where the auditors have found issue (like at sydney water authority). 
it would be interesting to hear how your tests progress. 
but i state again that the testing of 'low hanging fruit' does not tell you everything. 
this is known to be easy to move ... the issue you have to face is how do you deal with the bits that are hard/impossible to move. 
do not leave consideration of this until after you have started your march down the implementation road. 
because you may end up with an intel based system and a new mainframe. 
this might not then be a good idea because the perceived business benfit of throwing out the mainframe will have erroded! 
finally i am aware of one small mainframe site, like yours, who replaced an old amdahl box with dell intel servers. 
after 2 years they found they had more than 100 dell servers to manage, operate, fix, apply virus protection, etc, etc. they have now embarked on a vendor change and a major project to consolidate the many intel servers to a smaller number of 'virtualised' intel servers. 
i wonder how long it will be before they come to their sences and think about migrating back to a future mainframe?? only time will tell. 
good luck!!
