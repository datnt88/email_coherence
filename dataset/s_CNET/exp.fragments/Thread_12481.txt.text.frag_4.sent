i'm having the same problem. 
dell has been out to switch out the sound card - same problem. 
tech support at creative tried some software fixes with me, but wasn't able to solve the problem. 
i'm going to try a higher end microphone with the sound card and also a usb microphone. 
anyone find any other fixes?
