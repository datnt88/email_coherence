windex is the gentle method. 
if drastic method is used by the companies that recycle cartridges. 
they use boiling water and it will usually work. 
pour the boiling water into a container big and deep enough to immerse the ink jets or print head. 
hold it under water for several minutes until you see ink in the water. 
you may have to do this two or three times and you may have to squeese the cartridge. 
once you are getting ink out of the cartridge wipe everything dry with a paper towel and then top of the ink. 
to get the ink flowing in your printer print out one of these pages: if the print head is is not in the cartridge you may have to clean it separately.
