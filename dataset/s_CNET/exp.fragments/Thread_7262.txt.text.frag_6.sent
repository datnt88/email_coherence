i just finished my freshman year at college, and i have a laptop. 
as long as you have a modern laptop (not one that's three or so years old like mine), a laptop should take care of every need a college student has. 
it's definitely good to have a usb drive laying around, as they get used a lot. 
right now, vista really isn't that big of a deal for a college student, so i wouldn't worry about that little part. 
windows xp will do fine. 
and dual core is a nice touch, but it isn't necessarily needed. 
the only real problem with laptops is screen size. 
there have been reports released that staring at small (12&quot; of so) laptop screens for hours (as college students are prone to do) can be very bad for the eyes. 
therefore, i'd suggest getting something with a decent-sized screen. 
mine is about a 13&quot;, and it's a little small for me, in my opinion. 
just make sure it's something that will be comfortable to look at.
