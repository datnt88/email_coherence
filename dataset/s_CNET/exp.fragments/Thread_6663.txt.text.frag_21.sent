i ordered 512 ddr ram, but since i'm out of the country, it'll take three weeks to get here(europe). 
i downloaded the defrag and free ram programs. 
i already have pc tune up(it only cost me $15 a few months ago). 
i do have xp. by the way, i have mozilla firefox, too, and i get a grey strip across the bottom of the screen(20% of the bottom) and need a simple way to remove it. 
any suggestions? 
i tried clicking and dragging, but no luck.
