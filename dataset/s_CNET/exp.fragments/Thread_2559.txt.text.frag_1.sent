i want to buy a new computer and haven't a clue as to which brand i should consider, what processor, hard drive etc. i love to be on the internet, make and play my own cd's, maybe make and play dvd's. 
i do not play video games at all, just solitaire, free cell, scrabble etc. i have a great hp photosmart printer (new at christmas) an lg 19&quot; flat screen monitor (new july 4/06) very good speakers and sub woofer. 
i could use a new keyboard, but have a great mouse. 
all i need is all the rest and i don't know where to start. 
which desktop brand is a good one for now and in the future and which hardware should i consider? 
any help would be so very much appreciate as i know nothing about any of this stuff. 
please help me and thanks so much.
