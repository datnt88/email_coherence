well here it is i have yet to install all the cables and all that and the power supply too (bfg 800w), does it look like i attached everything right so far? 
but there is a problem, i thought they would inclued the intel fan but they didnt :cry: now i have no cpu fan, i looked everywhere in my country and didnt find any at all now i have this powerful machine and cant use... unless... :bounce: i have a thermaltake fan from my older pc [...] 009275.jpg 
i cant attache it to the motherboard cuz (what do you call it? 
screws?) doesnt reach all the way, just barley!!, but the buttom of the fan fit perfectly on top of the cpu, its a big fan and worked well in the past, but i guess even if it didnt fit all of the surfece it will still work ok cuz the intel fan never did, and im not an overclock person anyways :p so any crazy ideas?
