bob, i'm not necessarily blaming xp. i just think that the processor, chipset, and xp aren't communicating when it comes to apic. it could be a hardware issue that ubuntu ignores and xp doesn't. 
maybe i have a flaky chipset or processor. 
i don't usually have this much trouble tracking down problems, but this one has me stumped.
