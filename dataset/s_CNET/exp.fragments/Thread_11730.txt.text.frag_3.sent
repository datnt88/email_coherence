im not adverse to a laptop i will take whatever is cheapest. 
i lokked @ the suggestion you made but the processor on it is 1.9ghz and i need 3.0ghz processer speed i have been looking on qvc and hsn because they have flex pay options and i am not trying to spend a small fortune all at one time being as though this was unexpected but it seems that the only ones that meet those spec are $800 and up. 
i would appreciateay other infoyou can find.
