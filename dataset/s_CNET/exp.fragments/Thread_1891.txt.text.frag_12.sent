a friend has a development tool that fails on machines with 1.0 gigabytes or over ram. it took a few months for the tool maker to verify the issue, but it was not resolved after a few years since the toolmaker was moving away from that toolset. 
you may be a victum of such a programming error or ... you have some incompatible piece of hardware. 
if this was my machine i would make sure the bios was the latest and the psu was a monster (my p4 has this 680 watt psu). 
then i might even relax the memory timing for yet another test. 
in the end, you've found the hardware issue.
