i don't know if the backup feature of this drive actually works with os x, it may do but i did not find anything definitive about it on their website. 
as it works with windows and mac os, i have a feeling that this drive is formatted in fat or fat32. 
this allows it to work, out of the box, on almost any machine. 
it is, however, a notoriously fickle and unstable format for your data. 
you would be well advised to format this drive in hfs+ (journaled) for your data's security. 
you can do this via disk utility.
