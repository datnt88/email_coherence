i plan on buying a new desktop computer in the next couple of months and many of the ones i've been looking at have slim cases or are made in a way that makes them impossible to add parts to the case. 
since most desktops are sold with only an ethernet port.. what are my options? the computer will be in a room that doesn't have access to the modem/router wiring throughout the house. 
i've been trying to figure out sometime what would truly have the best signal (pci or usb). 
there is also a wga600n rm wireless-n gaming adapter sold through linksys for a really fair price, but since it is a gaming adapter meant for turning wireless-g connections on ps3s into wireless-n, i'm assuming it won't work. 
i don't necessarily have to have a slime line ready to ship model, but they are the cheapest and easiest to get going. 
any advice on what to do will help. 
i'm simply looking for the best wireless connection available.
