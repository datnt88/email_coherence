the issue here is simple. 
stocking spare parts, issuing manuals and giving (free) support costs more than a new unit. 
some revolt against this but there is a second hand parts market on ebay for those that want to try replacing a part. 
do not bother asking the makers for parts on printers under a few hundred bucks. 
you'll waste your time.
