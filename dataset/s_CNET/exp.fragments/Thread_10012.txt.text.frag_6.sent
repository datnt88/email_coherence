so do you even know where you expect to get the internet from. 
its not like you can even assume there is a signal to receive much less boost with a repeater. 
since security on is the default for wireless its has become much more unlikely you will be able to leach off one of your neighbors. it will be cheapest to have internet installed in the house. 
even in the best case you will require a device to take the signal from outside the house where it may be strong enough to receive inside. 
i am sure if you are willing something will work, 100 ft towers with 1 meter microwave dish can go miles if you are willing to pay for it.
