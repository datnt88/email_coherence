the external hard drive i use is a maxtor 500gb hard drive. 
just a couple days ago i noticed some setup files that were on my hard drive were not working. 
then today i let the computer run a disk check during startup. 
and now about half of the data is corrupted. 
most of the affected data were zip archives, iso images, and video files. is there anything i can do to fix these errors? 
or are corrupted files gone forever?
