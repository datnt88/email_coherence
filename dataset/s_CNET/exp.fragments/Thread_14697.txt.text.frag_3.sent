thanks for responding. the system isn't built yet. 
i ran across this conundrum while researching for my rebuild. 
so, since i am responsible for whether or not things work together, i wanted to get some help with this before i spend a good chunk of money. 
if a person could ever get a response from asus, i'd ask them. 
i sent them an email 2 years ago and haven't heard anything yet. 
i guess the question is : what would the average computer genius use? 
ecc or non_ecc?
