i've worked at best buy and circuit city in the repair department, and i have to say that the service plans (not extended warranties) are good on some items, and not worth it on others. 
laptops are one of those items thats a no brainer to get it on, especially with the battery replacement that is available, i've gotten a new battery every year, where if i were to buy it online for my model it was $230 per battery + s&h. 
as quality of work at bestbuy, depends on who touches it, best buy has over 2000 instore geeksquad agents, and i can swear that the majority of them our good techs, but i have met one or two bad apples, and trust me they dont stay with the company for long, b/c they do watch how many redos you get and you do get performance counselled. 
and as for how long it takes, depends, on desktop, if its anything but the motherboard/processor, then it can be repaired in store, which isnt that long of a fix. 
if its a desktop, they can only do memory and harddrive repair instore (alot of manf. 
will not send parts, but mem and harddrives are pretty generic) (notebook harddrive repair is new for instore warranty repair at bestbuy) as far as cc quality, well they are doing a massive recruiting effor of the more experienced geeksquad agents, so i'm new to them, and the as of now, the instore pc services do not handle any of the warranty repair. 
if your computers broken, you take it to customer service and they send it to the service center, i have heard that its alot faster then bestbuys service center, (bestbuy we would quote 2-8 weeks for items being shipped) at circuit they quote 1-2 weeks. 
overall, a computer is an investment, and if you want to protect your investment, then get the protection, dont hate on the sales people for pushing it down your throat, they are just trying to make a buck, (they may not get commission, but they get schedule more hours if they are more profitable)...
