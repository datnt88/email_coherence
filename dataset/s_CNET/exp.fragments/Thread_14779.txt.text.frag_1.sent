how can i get my old but trusty 4050n hp printer to work with my new computer that has no parallel port? 
i have some other ports on the back of the printer. 
two kind of look like those used to connect up a monitor. 
another looks like a ps2 port i think it is called that was used and i guess still is used to connect a keyboard or mouse. 
thanks in advance for any help, dave
