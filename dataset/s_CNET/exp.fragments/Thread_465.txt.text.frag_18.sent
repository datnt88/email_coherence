i think i need to upgrade to a new pc, but it's still running fine and i don't have enough money to upgrade at the moment. 
i replaced the dvd-rom and repaired the dvd burner. 
replaced the hard drive after it started failing. 
and upgraded the ram to 2gb (max). 
other than that, it's been running fine and is fully compatibe with: windows xp and vista linux (any distro i threw at it) and mac os x leopard (small hacker experiment that lasted a few weeks)
