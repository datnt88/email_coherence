thankyou bob, yours is probably the first link to info that even mentions the service. 
everyone else keeps posting about how its there but not working. 
i have tried this and it did not seem to start the service but i had no errors on the command prompt, to test i even start mediaplayer from the command line and it worked fine. 
ill see what i can find on that command elsewhere since at least its now something to go on. 
so thanks for that info.
