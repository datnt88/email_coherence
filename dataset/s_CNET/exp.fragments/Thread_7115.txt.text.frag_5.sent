an ip like you mention makes no sense at all, no router would assign an ip like that. 
you need to be working with the 192.168 range, so that it is private. 
it could be your router has a problem, you might try resetting it and reconfiguring it, but the address you describe is not within the range handed out by any router i have seen, unless someone messed with it quite seriously. 
give one system an ip of 192.168.1.2 and the other 192.168.1.3 and see if you can ping one from the other.
