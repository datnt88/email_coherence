hello experts, i have a dell dimension xps t850r desktop (atx casing, piii, 887mhz,760mb ram, winxp). 
it is very slow machine now, and i was trying decide between upgrading it or buying a new one... since my budget is around $200. 
ifi bought a new motherbaord, ram and processor, will the new motherboard fit in the current casing or will there be any misalignment? 
which motherboard should i buy? 
i highly appreciate any advice! 
thanks
