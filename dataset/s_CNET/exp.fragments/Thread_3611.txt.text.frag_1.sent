i have a d-link and linksys router. 
i am wanting to manage them threw network mapping software. 
i am having trouble finding a freely available one. 
i have looked at download.com and freewarefiles.com. 
i am also new to networking so some of the terms i am not 100% familiar with. 
any ideas of what i can use?
