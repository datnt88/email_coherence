even though the runtime software site advises against using their product for physically damaged drives, i thought what the heck? 
i've got nothing to lose! it worked like a charm! 
i was able to restore all of my files and they operate just fine! 
i wish i had know about this from the beginning instead of using that rip-off data recovery place. 
thanks again!
