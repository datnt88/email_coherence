just buy an external drive case from a pc store. the are cheap and not cheap depending on what you want to spend. 
if you use firewire on on your pc you may want to get one with that it is suppose to be faster. 
however i use a usb external case and it works fine. 
if you look around you will probably get a full kit with a hard drive for the price of a hard drive alone. 
there are great benifits to having one of these kicking around.
