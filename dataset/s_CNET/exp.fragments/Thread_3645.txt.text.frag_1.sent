ok i have a question, as we all do. 
i had windows xp on my old computer and something in it died. the geek squad said it was a green chip in the mother board. 
i am not savvy on the lingo as you can tell. 
so i bought a new hp with vista. 
it seems to work pretty good for me. 
my question is what to do with the drive in my old computer. 
i heard you should not just throw it away because it contains alot of stuff. 
can i hook it up to my new one or have my it guy at work load it on a disk or beat it with a hammer? 
hope to get an answer. 
thanks
