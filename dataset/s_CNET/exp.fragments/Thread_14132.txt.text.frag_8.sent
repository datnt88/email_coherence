what about my preview/print question? 
did you see it? 
as for the rest of the issue, you don't get my point. 
i never expected an engineer to &quot;fix or change&quot; anything. 
rather, i was seeking an engineer to help me get to the bottom of the mystery, & advise me what it is that old crts have in common with notebooks. 
that way, i'd know what to look/ask for when shopping for monitors. 
do they have in common: (1) that they have fewer bulbs than digital crts/lcds? 
(2) that the bulbs are lower wattage than digitals? 
(3) other? 
my brother-in-law just gave me an older notebook computer to try out, after i mentioned my problem. 
he inherited it from a cousin, but he said it doesn't seem to be working. 
i never owned a notebook in my life. 
it's a 500 cs toshiba tecra with intel pentium. 
when i try hooking it up, a yellow lite lights up in the rightmost panel which has an icon that *seems* to look like a battery. 
but i don't understand why the display isn't lighting up - after all, it's plugged in... am i missing something?
