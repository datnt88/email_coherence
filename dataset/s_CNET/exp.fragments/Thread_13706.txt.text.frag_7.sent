i had stated before that i disabled the services for windows media center. 
yes, i stopped them first and attpemted the other applications and still get the same error. 
it is not a windows issue. 
i called adaptec. 
they told me that hp is responsible for support and hp still insists that it is a setting or configuration error. 
i spoke to them again today for about 2 hours before the battery ran out on my cordless. 
it has to be a driver issue, because the device gives me the exact same error on a different pc, running plain windows xp. the driver is version 1.0 and is apparently designed to only work with windows xp. i am still trying to get this escalated through hp support. the only way that there ever will be a different driver created is if enough people call there and complain. 
hp has to order it through adaptec (if they haven't already, because when i called adaptec they would not provide any information on it) call hp and complain!!! it's toll free and 24-7. 
having a pvr that the driver cannot handle s-video, composite or audio capture is absurd!
