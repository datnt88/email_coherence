too funny dude! 
i laughed so hard when i read this. 
well even after the bios update i am still having the same problem. 
i called gateway again and they acknowledged the problem but they have no idea what is causing the reboots. 
they are going to replace my motherboard. 
i asked him if they are just going to keep throwing parts at it since they don't know the root cause. 
i told him if they didn't fix it this time i want a brand new pc other than gm5478. 
i am not one of those crazy sue happy people but i think we can get a class-action lawsuit rolling here if gateway doesn't own up to the problem and fix it. 
what is everyone else's thoughts here? 
i would even be willing to talk to an attorney that specializes in torts if enough people are interested.
