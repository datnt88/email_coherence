start/run/all progarms/pchelp & tools/ hp pc recovery cd-dvd creator make the dvds (mine required 2; yours may only require 1). then start/run/all progarms/pchelp & tools/hp pc recovery tools cd. you need the recovery tools cd to wipe the d: partition containing restore information (i deleted mine) and to start the pc if it crashes so you can use the recovery dvd. 
send a set of both to your mom. 
good luck!
