to make hd data unrecoverable, first delete it. 
then over-write where it was (and where rit can be recovered from) by filling the free space with garbage files. 
fill a folder with pictures, for instance, then makes endless copies of the folder until the hd runs out of space. 
this'll make the data unrecoverable to anyone other than the cia.
