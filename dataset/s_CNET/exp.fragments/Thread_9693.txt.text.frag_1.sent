room mate just purchased a presario 502us laptop with a built in wlan nic with the broadcom chipset running vista basic home edition. 
the wlan card recognizes various wireless networks in the immediate area. 
i can connect to the router via cable through the ethernet nic. 
i have several other computers currently active on the wireless network. 
all the other systems are running xp pro sp2 i do not see my wireless network on the 502us even though i see other networks including one creatively named &quot;netgear&quot;. because the cg814wg is distributed to several isp's, netgear does not support the firmware and my isp has been little help since i couldn't get past tier one support. 
anyone out there have any ideas i might try? 
anyone else experience any issues with vista or broadcom chipsets and this particular modem/router? 
thanks in advance for any help.
