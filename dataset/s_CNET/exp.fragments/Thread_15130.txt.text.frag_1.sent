we are running winxp we have a cable connection to the dlink di-524 router. 
our lan consists of two desktops wired to the router, one wireless laptop, and a wireless xbox adaptor model: mn-740. the xbox adaptor only has wep security (not wpa). 
i live in a densely packed neighborhood and at any time there are strangers using my wireless router because i have no security enabled. 
i have tried to secure the network, following the dlink instructions, but always end up with one problem when i enable wep security: the xbox live cannot access the internet, even after adding the wep key into the xbox security section. 
please tell me very simply how to enable my dlink wep security and how to make it work with the xbox adaptor. 
one more thing, when i look on the di-524 info on the home, dhcp page, only the computers are listed, the xbox is not listed, is the the cause of my problems and if so, how do i add the xbox to this page?
