hey thanks for the help. 
i'm actually learning something about hardware having to review all these items... since i won't be doing any gaming on this pc, but i do plan to be messing around with mp3's and photo editing, the p4 would be a better choice. 
but how about recording dvd's? 
i posted the socket 479 because i really don't know what is standard for my desired applications, or what the specs would mean when it comes to performance. 
i realize now that something offering a faster fsb with more ram is a must. 
i'm not sure how many devices i'm going to be running, other than hard drive and a dvd-rw... any suggestions on a couple boards?
