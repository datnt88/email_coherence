i assume you're using the 06/19/2008 bios. 
are you manually setting the timings to match the stick or just letting the mobo use it's defaults? 
also, are you using the same bank of dimm slots? 
first, manually set the ram for ddr2-667 and confirm it's stable. 
if it's not, the mobo is probably bad. 
also try populating the two slots closest to the cpu (one orange, one yellow) and sticking with the mobo default memory settings. 
if you try to use all 4gb in one bank (both sticks in the orange slots), you may have to boost the memory voltage to 1.95v or 2.0v. 
if neither of these works, you may want to consider swapping ram to a memory brand that's been qualified by ecs (mushkin's a great brand but ecs may not allow an rma using their ram).
