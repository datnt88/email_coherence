installed a diamond x1650 agp512sb radeon x1650pro 512mb agp 4x/8x video card in computer #1 for an upgrade-no problems, works great. 
wanted to buy and install another of same card in computer #2 but will not fit. 
#2 computer has micro atx mobo and the height of the fan/sink/cooler on the x1650 video card hits the pci card next to the agp slot (video card basically takes up a slot and a half). 
cannot move pci card to another slot to make room for video card. 
am trying to replace a diamond stealth s120 radeon 9550 256mb agp 4x/8x card with fan/sink/cooler that fits (barely) without hitting pci card next to it. 
diamond website lists both cards as &quot;full height&quot;. 
(from looking at photos looks like dropping down to model # x1600 that the fan/sink/cooler doesn't rise as high and would fit). 
are there different &quot;profile&quot; heights? 
how do i determine what card will fit?
