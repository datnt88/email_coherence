thank you for the reply and suggestion. 
i know the router's wan address because i can display the assigned address (dhcp). 
i know another address which is the default gateway provided which is probably the other end. 
however, i didn't think i needed to get an address on that network because i am only sniffing packets and not (i hope) transmitting anything. 
i should be able to grab packets passively without actually having a valid ip address. 
good news. 
problem solved. 
(and i'm embarrassed.) the problem was with the monitoring pc. it was running a firewall. 
since i was seeing arps and dhcp traffic and not running any filters, i thought i was getting everything. the firewall (zonealarm) was allowing the arps, etc through but blocking all the tcp and udp packets. 
by lowering the security on the firewall, i was able to see everything. 
from this first attempt to look at the packets between the router and cable modem, i can see this educational exercise is going to significantly difficult. 
(at least for me. 
i spent days getting past a firewall problem!) i didn't recognize much of anything in the 200mb i've looked at so far. 
this education is going to be time comsuming.
