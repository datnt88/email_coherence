i don't think the fact that i didn't know how to turn on/off my network adapter is a sign i don't know my laptop. 
it's just a part of my computer i've never had to deal with before (network adapter). 
i'm confident the problem is the router. 
it's just so inconsistent with my laptop. 
i keep having my signal dropped, and it simply won't connect in areas of my house where previously it always had a strong connection. 
i just put in my order for a dlink 655 xtreme n gigabit router. 
here's to hoping that will solve my issues. 
at the very least, it should help me figure out what the real issue is.
