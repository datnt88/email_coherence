you did just fine. 
my snide comment is that today you will find many of these instructions to assume that you would know that &quot;you also need to do this.&quot; if that isn't good enough for you consider this. 
i will never rewrite a post if it gets the job done. 
that is, this is all volunteer and if it will take me more than 30 seconds to rewrite it to avoid bruising someone's psyche i won't. 
let's get it done. 
ok? bob
