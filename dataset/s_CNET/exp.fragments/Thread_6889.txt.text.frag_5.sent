usa may not be the only country which speaks english, but whatever country you are at certainly doesn't, judging by your post. 
dell service is indeed horrible, not only because of the language problems, which are undeniable, but because dell's indian customer support stuff is rude, incompetent and generally is a bunch of losers (see how i spelled it ?) and about ''u r not able to live up with the world'' - if you and other preferred dell customers represent the world, its a sad state of affairs.
