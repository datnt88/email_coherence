i've read much praise from targus apa10us adaptors on other forums but i've actually had issues with those adaptors (yes, plural). 
i used these adaptors exstensively and exclusively for my toshiba satellite a55-s136 but after a year or so those adaptors die. 
when i plug them in the blue light on the brick flickers for less than a second and then nothing. 
i'm not an electrical engineer but is this a case of a short circuit? 
any help would be super cool, thanks.
