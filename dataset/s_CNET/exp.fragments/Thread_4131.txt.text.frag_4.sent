use the factory restoral cds that came with the pc. restore it to factory day one out of the box. 
if the pc came with a restoral partition on the hard drive, use it the same way. 
since you still neglected to give make and model, these are the only two for restoral. 
or, you can google dban which will completely wipe the hard drive.
