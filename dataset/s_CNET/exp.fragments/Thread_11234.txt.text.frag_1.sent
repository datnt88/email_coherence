hi i still have the 40 gb hard drive that came with the dimension 2400, however i have upgraded ram to 1gb and video card to fx5200. 
i read around and there seem to be a lot of things to consider such as different types of hard disks and maybe i am short on power supply and that the dimension 2400 only has one power source for hard disk. 
there is a lot more than that as well it seems. 
below are some information from belarc advisor operating system system model windows xp home edition service pack 2 (build 2600) dell computer corporation dimension 2400 enclosure type: space-saving processor 2.40 gigahertz intel celeron 8 kilobyte primary memory cache 128 kilobyte secondary memory cache main circuit board board: dell computer corp.
