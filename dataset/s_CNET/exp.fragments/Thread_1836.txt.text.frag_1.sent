if you read my other post my pc is messed up but the hard drive is perfectly fine. 
now there are some very important files on there and i was wondering that if i were to put that hard drive in my dad's pc, what will happened? 
his pc has xp and xp is also on my hard drive. 
i was wondering if there is a way i can just get the files out of there? 
because if i can just get the files i can then move them to my dad's hard drive and erase what on my hard drive and then add it as more storage to another pc
