some but not all mtrbd. 
makers list ram modules known to work with thier mtrbd.. once, you find the mtrbd. 
you plan to buy verify or check the support website, beforehand. 
it should be the last bit or noted info on memory tested. 
beware of cheap ram also, as its wide level of sub-performance can be found in demanding mtrbds., 
i can only say, if its cheap, expect cheap output overtime.
