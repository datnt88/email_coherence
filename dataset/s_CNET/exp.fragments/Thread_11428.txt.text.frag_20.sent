too much, too late! 
i have been using google docs for years. 
apple now offers its iwork's for free too. 
ms decision to make office for ipad is simply too late, and probably too much too. 
oh!! for those who say you cant do serious work on a tablet... plenty of great bluetooth keyboards around for cheap. 
(even some really nice bt keyboard cases.) for those seriously working, they already have laptops, using office work alikes to great creations.
