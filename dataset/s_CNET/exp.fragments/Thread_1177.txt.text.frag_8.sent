those cordless phones are not the same thing with differences i decline to list since i would have to write quite a few paragraphs. 
i'm an electronics designer with designs in two way paging systems so to express why would result in many paragraphs. the try it and find out is the usual route.

for me yes. 
for others? 
maybe.
