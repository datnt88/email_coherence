i have a wireless home network. 
my internet service was down for 4 days. 
after the comcast technician repaired the cables, i was able to get my desktop back on the internet, but not the laptop. 
my desktop is wired to the netgear router, and my laptop is wireless. 
my laptop is connected to the network. 
i am able to share the printer as before. 
i originally used my laptop to set up the router and network. 
very frustrated, please help. 
this my first time posting, and i'm not sure if this is enought information.
