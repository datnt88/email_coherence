i use a hpf1903 19'' lcd it works well with nivida gforce and with 1280x1040 res. 
max it gives hd a new out look on hd. goes for about 795.00 on sale. 
a little more than you said you wanted to pay. 
but well worth it. 
it rocks! 
no i mean it really rocks back and forth, tilts and telescopes about 6'' versatile and very cool. 
will accept hdmi or db25 or both and comes with the hdmi cable
