while i tend to agree, the fact is apple owns the market for mp3 players. 
my first player was a dell dj, and it was good, if not great mp3 player. 
but if you want any versatility with from a player, the ipod is the only way to go because there are literally tons of accessories available. 
although, the dj is well represented in terms of accessories, most are only available on-line from dell and a few other vendors. 
but you can go to almost any type of store and find ipod accessories. 
from docks to cases to car stereo integration to boom boxes, there appears to be no end to the options and versatility for the ipod. 
nothing beats having my music library with me at all times, whether that be in the car, while shopping at sams, or while working out - all with the same player.
