why not using a fon hotspot, which comes out of the box with real security and separation between users (note: the separate ip is not a security, because all ips in a classic hotspot can directly ping each other and discover themselves). 
fon hotspot are cheap, preconfigured, and will provide bandwidth capping for each user; there are even some admin tools to help manage the protocols you want to keep available. 
if ever you get extra costs from your isp, fon will grant you additional rights because of the usage made by your customers on your hotspot. 
no complication: keep yout existing wifi hotspot in private mode for your own usage, just connect the fon router on an ethernet port of your internet router, or on an intermediate switch.
