hallelujah, seagate finally responded to my inquiry. 
they asked for a serial number and when i provided it, i told them that i had already downloaded and installed the software but that it kept hanging at the point that it detected the device. 
they responded that they did not know where i got the software because it was not available on their public website (which i knew). 
they provided me a customer support link to download the software, so i uninstalled the software that i downloaded based upon the google search on the program that you (linux_made) provided and voila the software link that seagate provided worked and i have successfully unlocked my hard drive. 
thank you to everyone for all their ideas. 
i also suggested to seagate that they insert a warning to make a back up of the software to cd immediately after installation of the driver and setup software which i don't know whether they will heed or not.
