yeah, olympus was one of my 1st digital cameras. 
i have had other newer digital cameras; but olympus was always my back-up. 
it was very dependable. the last picture for my trip is when the card &quot;went south&quot; on me. 
i have a nice nikon coolpix that i like; but i wasn't going to take that out into the woods with a hundred 6th graders. 
i took my old back-up, the olympus. 
in retrospect i guess that olympus was an old-timer. 
thank you so much for the quick response.
