i just hooked up my acer netbook and i'm only going to use this to play and store mp3's. 
is it ok to uninstall the following: 1. microsoft works (that's 567.00mb) 2. adobe reader (that's 204.00mb) 3. windows live essentials (that's 120.00mb) 4. how do i disable the warning that comes up when the computer is turned on saying my computer is not protected. 
thanks!!!!
