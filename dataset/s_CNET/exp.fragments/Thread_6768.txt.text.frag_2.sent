let's clear one thing, you can't run raid using one physical hd, you have a partitoned hd that acts as if two. 
in other words you need two real hds in order to run raid of even sizes. 
next, i suggest you use either partition magic or any other so-called partitioning s/w in order to combine the partitions, either buy or use shareware s/w. 
however, the old fashion way is to delete all on the partitions using the s/w the hd maker provides, usually free. 
goto the support website of the hd maker and get the diags or s/w that's available. 
running such s/w is destructive to data, so save what you need or simply proceed once ready. 
when asked, combine or accept the hd as one large hd, non-partitioned.
