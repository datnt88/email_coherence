we had no graphics to speak of. 
all i/f was through the teletype panel. 
though, some could say the punch cards were also an i/f. 
let's see, input a problem and walk away or await a call to say the work was done. 
also, computers were noisy back then up to a point. 
those printers back then, really pounded away. 
heck, i had to learn &quot;tube theory&quot; and read all those darn logic schematics.
