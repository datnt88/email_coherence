...is a special type of chip. 
this chip contains all your bios info. 
if you reset your cmos (or flash it for that matter) you reset all your bios options to default values. 
it has no other effect on any hardware. 
everything from date/time, to cpu options (mulitpliers, voltages etc.), to ide drives details are held in the bios settings. 
after resetting you simply have to set these all back to what they were before. 
geebee.
