hello, i have 4 laptops (3 vista and one xp), and a netgear wgr614 (it came with the virgin connection). 
i wanna play counterstrike by connecting all the four laptops wireless. 
please tell me how to connect all the laptops for gameplay. 
a step-by-step instruction would be very helpful as i'm not an expert with computers. 
thanks in advance.
