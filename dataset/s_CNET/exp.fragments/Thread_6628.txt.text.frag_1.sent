&quot;if you have a second physical disk in your machine, you can boost performance by moving your paging file (pagefile.sys) 
onto your second drive&quot; i hear this all the time... is it true ? 
if yes then... shall i make my (20 gb fat 32 hd) into paging file disk ? 
and should i disable the page file in... my main hd ? 
also, i got this hd from a fren, it's working fine... but it had 5 bad clusters. 
(which i surfaced scanned and all)... but my fren didn't want it, so i took it... it's basically free!!! i will be using it only for paging file and temp folder for my other softwares (like audition, photoshop... kaza, limeware...etc) now... is there any software, that can further check, or help in bad clusters? 
till now... it has only, 5 bad clusters... help !!! please... gsoul2soul
