your system should be capable of having both. 
it can also do well with just one, being the new burner. 
alot depends on your usage, so take it from there. 
install both for now and if you feel later you're really not getting the use out of both, then stick with the new. 
yes, you can install the new burner as your old, but remember to remove/delete any old s/w related to the old drive.
