thanks for the reply. 
i was pretty sure the 1.4 v and such was a mobo function. 
what the psu brings to the table (according to thg testing, etc.) is stability of the +12, +5, etc. under no-load and full load conditions. 
so, thanks for validating that. 
i have chosen to go with big psu on the basis that i use both ata and scsi drives and plenty of both. 
and, one never knows about a second video card -- as i said, i keep things a long time. 
anyway, thanks again for the reply.
