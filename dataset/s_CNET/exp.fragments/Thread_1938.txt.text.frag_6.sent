and no bios screen it does not look like a settings issue. 
it now looks like a pc that needs repair. 
as to the &quot;done something to the graphics card? 
could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?&quot; 
i have yet to encounter that as a cause of a card failure. 
most failures are because of inadequate cooling, failed fan or a bad power supply. 
since there is no bios, splash or other screens the machine should be treated like a dead pc and we begin the repairs by replacing the parts we suspect first.
