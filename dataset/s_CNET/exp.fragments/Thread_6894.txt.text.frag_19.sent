statement they made.. if you buy this crucial 100% compatible with acer 5517 4gb kit it'll show 2gb under bios and any os cause it's 256x64 ram which is high-density, where it only supports 128x8 density no matter which k8 cpu you have in it.. i'm doing nothing but verifying the relevance of this subject and showing statements made to discredit it are wrong.
