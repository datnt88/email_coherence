drive letters are not a bios's job. 
so nothing to do there. 
xp may sniff out the old drive letters, so if this was mine i would install the new drive on it's own, install the os then boot it up, complete the install that microsoft doesn't do for us (drivers and more) and when i like it, add the old drive back in. 
have fun, bob
