hi! recently i added a hd to my pc running winxpsp2, formatted by winxp and installed as primary slave. 
when i turn the pc on, the driver is not shown, only c: and d: are indicated (primay master) but primary slave does not. 
if i restart the system the slave disk shows up and works normally. 
when i turn the system off and them on again the slave is again missing, once again to see the slave drive i have to restart the system one more time. 
any suggestion?
