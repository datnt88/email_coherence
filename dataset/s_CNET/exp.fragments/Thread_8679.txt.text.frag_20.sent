nope, if i ask for a coke and you bring back a pepsi i would send you back again. 
why would i accept any cola flavoured drink as a substitute. 
also, we never call a drink a &quot;soda&quot;. 
we may have a soft drink made with soda water but not call it a soda. 
other soft drinks use lemonade or water bases. 
it therefore follows that calling any &quot;tablet computer&quot; an ipad may be determined by where you live.
