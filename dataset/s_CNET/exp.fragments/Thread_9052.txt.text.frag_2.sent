well this is kind of a rare issue. 
it might be the apple is having the problem than the windows based pcs because its 2:1 but on your case its the other way around. 
given the fact that you have changed the channels multiple times i bet you have tried this. 
change the channel on the router from 6 to 11 or 1 and also try : changing the tx rate, lock it to 54 mbps each of the wireless device for windows based. 
just try, then re post if it didn't work. 
hope i help
