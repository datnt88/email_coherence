when faced with such, i usually try the printer/device on a machine with the supported os to see if the pc or the device has an issue. 
other thoughts? 
1. try any self test features. 
2. the host pc is often not uptodate on motherboard or other drivers. 
since microsoft doesn't update bios, motherboard, usb and more drivers, this usually has to be done manually.
