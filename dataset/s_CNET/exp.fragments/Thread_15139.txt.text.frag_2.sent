not be compatible. 
i don't like buying cases with the power supply because the supply is usually a low bid item. 
i know that enermax makes power supplies, but they make cheapies and good ones. the good ones have the &quot;true power&quot; in their name, meaning that they actually provide the full rating 100% of the time. 
for the cheapies the ratings are for the peak wattage.
