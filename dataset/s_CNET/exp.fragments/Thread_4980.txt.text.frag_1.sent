to elaborate, is there a feasible way to downclock(?) the gpu in order to still have it &quot;in reserve&quot; for when i need it? 
basically, i'm looking to know if it's worth getting a gpu only to use some of the time---so if i can't turn it down or otherwise minimize the excessive battery drain, then i will just stick with the intel gma. 
i don't do too much away from ac power, but having some semblance of battery life is good to have.
