hi jack, thank you for the info, i did try this but it didn't seem to make a difference. the graphics card has been working fine in my brother's p4 system for a number of months now, and his geforce 2 mx has been working fine in my system without any problems for the same period of time. 
i have just carried out a clean install, so will be swapping them back again pretty soon. 
regards, harinder
