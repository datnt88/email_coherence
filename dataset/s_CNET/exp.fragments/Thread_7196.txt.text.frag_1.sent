1. the computer is less than 3 months old. 
computer freezes now at less once a day when on the internet searching. 
will not restart by ctrl/alt/delete. 
2. there is no scan for errors under accessories/system's tools. 
did window's vista not add that feature to the program? 
how can you check for errors on the computer with vista?
