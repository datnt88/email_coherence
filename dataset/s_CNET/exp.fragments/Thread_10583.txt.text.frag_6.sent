just for the heck of it download a free trial of nero to the system and try that, you have nothing to lose unless of course you have a buddy who has a nero or roxio disk you can load. 
for vista it would have to be a pretty current version of either. 
but i would give it a shot, especially since it shows in device manager.good 
luck!
