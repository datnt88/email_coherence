a bad caps issue is also found on other devices. 
for a psu to go, it needs a reason. 
it appears you haven't found the real reason it went bad. 
i suggest you tear down the system and inspect it. 
a bad mounting on the mtrbd. 
and/or chaffed harness, etc. can be a cause. 
you didn't provide details on your system, but if the psu goes, then very possible a device like a cd drive, video card, excessive heat, etc. is faulty. 
you just can't trust *anything* until tested elsewhere. 
afterall, 4 psu going bad suggests that. 
of course, bad ac power is still a possible issue. 
a floating ground, poor connections, or reverse wiring can be a home issue. 
an ac line tester brought at radio smack can see if the wiring is ok. also, if not already a surge protector of decent quality can help. 
if you have one, understand it works usually only once when a true power hit/surge, thus look for a led type telltale showing its active not ac power present. 
alas, an electrician should be called to really check the home wiring for the pc outlet(s). 
good luck tada -----willy
