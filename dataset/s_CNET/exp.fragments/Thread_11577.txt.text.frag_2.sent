it's probably more of an coincidence that the oc'ing and now the warning are popping up. 
i would just clear it all up by checking the defaults are truly set. 
you can use the &quot;restore feature&quot; of your os to return to a day before it all changed with updates, etc.. once that is done, then check the overall operation for some time and then update if necessary again. 
your experience is why its best to do one step/item at a time rather more too closely as then you'll doubt what's happened or confronted by possible multiple areas to check.
