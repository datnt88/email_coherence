hi. i bought a computer, witha a pcchips 863g mother board. 
a western digital hard drive, asus video card (geforce 5200). the processor is an amd sempron 2800+, and 512mb of memory (markvision). 
my problem is, that once the computer is on. 
it lasts only something like 15 min, or sometimes 5 min, and then it suddenly restarts. 
this is very annoying. 
it does it, no matter the aplication i`m running, just restart, even changing de desktop theme. 
so a lot of friends, say that it could be the memory, that comes bad. it only happens when i`m using the asus video card, because, when i`m using the integrated mother board, video card, everything runs fine (but the bios, only gives to video ram, 32mb). 
i think that the video vard is ok, because when it restarts, windows xp, tell me, that the problem is with the video, and gives me the solution, of slowing the &quot;hardware aceleration&quot;,but doing that, still happens. 
so, what do you think? 
thanks for your help, and sorry for my bad english. 
:$ bye
