why do they make it so that the new tvs pretty much have to use hdd in fat32 or wont load sometimes / freeze etc... when i want to play saved dvd, blue-ray, and personally recorded game vids that trump the file size ... is there some better way i am suppose to go about this or suffer without a, larger files or b, not being able to get to data 1/4 the time...?
