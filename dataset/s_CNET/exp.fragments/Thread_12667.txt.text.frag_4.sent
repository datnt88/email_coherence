when you infringe on the forum policies, such will happen. 
i see no need to write more if you intend to follow da' rules. 
when you supply a link, i expected it to pertain to the issue, instead it was some unrelated site. 
as to the dlink firewall, i have the dlink and it's &quot;odd&quot; about rules. 
it took me more than a few minutes to figure out how it's rules worked. 
keep reading about it and see if it sinks in.
