depending on the limitations of your laptop and whether you plan to upgrade to a newer os, the age of your current laptop, etc., the answer will be different. 
if you're running with 512k and a 40 gb hard drive, you're obviously not running vista or windows 7. does your laptop support sata or are you forced to stay with ide? if you can go with sata, you could get a 500 gb drive for $65. 
i wouldn't want to run vista or windows 7 with less than a 100 gb hard drive. 
not knowing the answers to the above questions, i'm inclined to believe you'd be better off getting a new computer because it sounds like you have a pretty old pc that as soon as you fix one bottleneck, you're going to run into another one. 
xp support runs out in 2014, so you'll probably have to upgrade to windows 7 or 8 in a little over a year in any regard.
