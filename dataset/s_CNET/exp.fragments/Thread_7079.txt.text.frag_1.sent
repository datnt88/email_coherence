hello, i just recently purchased a pair of bose 2.1 pc speakers. 
they are the bose companion 3 speakers which were rated very highly in the reviews which i read. 
while they do deliver excellent sound and decent power for their size, i feel as though they should be a little better based on their price and the reviews which i read. 
as of now they are connected to a p4 pc which is about 7 years old. 
the sound card is integrated into the motherboard, which is an asus sis 645 motherboard. 
my question is; if i upgrade my sound card by putting in a good pci one, will the sound improve on the speakers? 
will they deliver my power? 
in a sense, does the sound card act like an amp or receiver? 
any advice is much appreciated.
