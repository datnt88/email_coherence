open case and clean out the dust bunnies. 
leave side cover off and see if the system stays running longer. 
if not, then place fan to help cool it. 
if it continues to cause a problem at the same stop intervals as before, you may have a &quot;bad caps&quot; situation, google for examples. 
next, your psu maybe petering out, check all fans to see they're running to include psu one(if present). 
i won't return side until it appears fixed. 
if upon returning side cover and it still stops/freezes, then you have some component(anything) that's been compromised by heat stress and will fail all together at some future point. 
then and only then will it becomes obvious as it will work intermittently until failure. 
in this case only swapping parts may do to help determine cause.
