intel based macs were delivered to developers about a year ago. 
i have the fortunate envy of talking to such a developer and the words have been nothing but glowing. 
i'm sure you'll read some pundits write to stick with the powerpc chip, but take a trip back in time when apple moved from 68k to powerpc and ... the pundits wrote to stick with the 68k cpu &quot;while the bugs are worked out.&quot; 
history does repeat itself so ask yourself if you had picked up the 68k mac, what position would you be in?
