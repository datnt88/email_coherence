i've got the notice from windows 7 that the hard drive i'm on is failing. 
i'm considering getting a program that will copy the image over to a new hard drive. 
two questions: 1. will copying the exact image / sectors / etc whatever - will that also copy the problems onto my new hard drive, or will the problems that i have on the existing hard drive create issues with the image copy to the new hard drive? 
2. the new hard drive is significantly larger than the old one, will this be a problem in any way - i assume the partition isn't copied over in the transfer, but haven't done this in several years so just want to make sure.
