the official ddr2 spec ends at ddr2-1066. 
also, no mobo officially supports ddr2-1200. 
as with any overclocking, your results are dependent on the specific components. 
so one x38 mobo may be able to hit ddr2-1200 with that ram while another x38 mobo may not. 
likewise, one mobo may oc a cpu up to 4ghz while another may only get it to 3.8ghz. 
p.s.: ddr2-1200 will require a lot of voltage... these sticks want 2.3v. the official ddr2 spec is only 1.8v so that's 27% over spec and some mobos simply can't provide it. 
adding 4 sticks would need even more voltage. 
and 2.3v will need a very good quality power supply with extremely tight voltage regulation.
