the thg article with the best video cards at different budget levels is an excellent source, but you should look at the july version instead of may. 
why be outdated? 
i linked to the page recommending the gtx 560 at the $190 budget level. 
you can purchase an excellent brand, evga, of this card for $175, which would be an outstanding choice if your budget can stretch that far. 
however you could also get a big bargain if you want to step back. the next slower card on the list, which shows as &quot;check prices&quot; but is above the best card for $155, is the gtx 460 768mb. 
this card is being discontinued and replaced by the gtx 550 ti, so few are left and they are being sold off. 
i don't normally recommend factory re-certifed cards but in this situation i will since an evga card is available for only $120. 
you might also want to visit this site for instructions on how to upgrade video cards and general graphics card information: you might also want to use this thg page that shows performance rankings for most mid-range video cards - and you might find the rest of the article informative: another page in that article shows power consumption for the cards. 
both cards recommended above will work find on a 375w dell psu as long as you have not added some power hungry devices.
