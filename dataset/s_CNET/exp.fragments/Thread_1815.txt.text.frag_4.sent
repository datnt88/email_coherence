recheck your work, take nothing for granted. 
also, make sure you did connect the frt. 
panel power sw. to the right connection, sometimes the remote power and frt. 
panel connewctions are swapped. 
you know you got the right one, if you short that connection with a metal tip(screwdriver). 
verify 115/230v sw. is proper on power supply. 
also, tell us what you have, pc cases do differe and what you had to begin with, oem or generic?
