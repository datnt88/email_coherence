i have dell 2400 and i tried installing new lg dvd rw drive, as i installed this it worked for few hours and then this morning it is not booting up, as soon as i start power it starts and then shuts down and again starts but hangs before even display comes. 
i do not see any hard drive activity on the machine. 
with this new dvd rw cofiguratoin i may have screwed up something. 
please help how do i diagnose the error. 
thanks in advance.
