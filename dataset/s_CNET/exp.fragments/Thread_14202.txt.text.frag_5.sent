the fact that you don't know the mfr and where its made is not a reason in and of itself. 
it might be made in china, but so what. 
yes the odds are high that it is not the greatest power supply but as long as it is working, why worry. the 30 hour limit is in your head. the power supply internals have reached its &quot;stable&quot; running temperature in ten or so minutes. 
it may vary a little as the running load on the cpu varies depending on what you are doing. 
it should stay in that temperature range as long as it is on.
