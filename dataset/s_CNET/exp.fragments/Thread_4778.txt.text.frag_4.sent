i took the easy way. the ip plan i wrote about is that the first lan should be something like 192.168.1.x and the lan on the other side of the wrt54g must be something like 192.168.2.x. why would i do all that rough setup when this just works? 
again, once you get that out of the way be sure to check our stick post.
