here in the states, if the product doesn't do its intended purpose you can return, etc.. now, i can't recall but if that box shows a &quot;vista ready&quot; logo then it better work and all the more to have a full refund. 
just be sure to check your local laws on this matter if now you have a semi-useless canon product.
