hi stan, i'm a pc duffer, little technical knowledge but a bit of experience. 
a friend built me a pc 3+ years ago & i wanted to upgrade. 
first decision was the processor - what could i afford? 
once decided the processor mfrs. 
website gave a list of compatible boards. 
the board i decided upon narrowed the sound & video card choices & memory sticks. 
i got them all from a real cheap shop here in edinburgh. 
other components i reused. 
os inst. 
went ok & i was in business. 
i had a couple of knowledgeable friends on hand to help but they were not need. 
i felt real pleased when xp came to life . 
have a go & feel smug like i did.
