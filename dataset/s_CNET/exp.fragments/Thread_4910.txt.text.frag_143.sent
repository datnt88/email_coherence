boy - best buy and gateway have dropped the ball for me...i had this exact problem 6 months after purchase and no one ever mentioned that this is a common issue plaguing this computer (and possibly others). 
i have had my computer just over a year and problems began in june 2008. 
best buy implied that there is nothing wrong with my computer and made me feel whiny. 
poor computer has been in the best buy service center twice, plus in-store for diagnosis 3 times. 
next plan- send directly to gateway but even they did not mention that other have this issue...they all seemed surprised and no one wants to offer me a replacement computer. 
will peruse this site for more info, but glad to hear that i am not alone. 
looking for real fixes, if there are any out there. 
otherwise, will consider a mac!
