i have an epson printer and use generic cartidges that are 1/2-1/3 the price of oem. 
i have never had a problem with this method. 
i had a previous stylus that was ruined by trying to do refills. 
i strongly advise against. 
it is not worth ruining the printer head; which means you might as well get a new printer. 
i have a one year old canon pixma 850. 
i love it. 
i only buy generic, both the photo and regular inks. 
i order online (from xxx injets.com). 
shipping is free and no tax. 
since i do very little color printing and the black gets used a lot, i buy 12 30ml. 
cartidges for every one color or black for photo. 
although printing with color(maps, etc.) is prety, i never do it. 
what a waste. 
i can remove and replace the color cartridges at will. 
can't do that with the hp and lexmark rip-off machines! 
btw, if you believe that your cartridge has dried out rather than being empty, here's a fix. 
put a small amount of windex in a shallow saucer and set the catridge in it for a short while. the spongy material will absorb it and dissolve the dried out ink.
