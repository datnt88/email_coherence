dumb question probly...but the video card ...is that the slot card that the monitors serial connector mates to?...i did notice someone had pulled all the ram sticks out...i had a couple so i put 2 in ....but then i dont know if their good...question about the keyboard locks..i think i had a chassis that had a keyboard error...if i pull the wires from their conn. 
would that disable it's function or would i have to install a jumper on the connection?
