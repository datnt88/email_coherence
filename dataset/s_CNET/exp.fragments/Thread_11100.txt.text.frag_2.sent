what you want to accomplished? 
how many pc, you are talking about? 
how many wireless router you have? 
in general, you just put everything together in one place.. and connect using wireless. 
place one wireless router in other location... configured it as a different wireless accesspoint. 
using different channel, different ssid name, wpa/wep and password. 
connect your pc's to those switches and to the router (hardwired) or get a wireless network adapter (they are on sale too).. for all the pc's or laptop you have.. i don't think you can connect your switches and hub wirelessly...
