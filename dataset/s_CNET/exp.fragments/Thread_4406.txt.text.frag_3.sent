when i say &quot;laptop on the go&quot; i mean that i want to know what i can do to have wireless internet access on my high school campus. 
is placing a router in my locker feasible? 
that sorta thing. 
by &quot;replacing&quot; a cable modem with a wireless router, i meant that could i use a wireless router or some similar device to power reliable internet access in my home for both laptops and desktops instead of using a cable modem which i pay expensive monthly fees for. 
that's pretty much it. 
simple too.
