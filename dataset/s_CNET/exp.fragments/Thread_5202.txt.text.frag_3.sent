first off..its best to say when i reach my desktop..not so much that i bootup and this or that.. .. since you are useing a dvd-rom..you need to know the media types going in that tray..cds don't matter..but i use a toshiba(dash)drive that if i place a dvd(plus)disk in will corrupt my os..and i have a second dvd-drive that both(+ -)so all problems are eliminated.. .. then it seems you said that you shut-down with a disk in the tray..and then performed your start-up w/the disk still in the tray..this can cause a problem or not..never shut down with removable media in their devices(especially)the floppy drive.. .. also..are you running a scheduled scan..and you have forgotten..so your attempting to run two programs at once..and that could be your problem.. .. i also archive my files/folders..this keeps my system drive ready to run with little power management problems..i usually start with a empty pc..for each project..useing external hdds.. .. if none of the above is any help i would suggest you re-install and take a fresh look at your pc.
