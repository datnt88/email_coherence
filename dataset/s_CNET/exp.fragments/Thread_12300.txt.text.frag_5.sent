the cpu chip can live at 90 c, however that will certainly result in reduced lifetime. 
it is up to the computer builder to select the hsf for the cpu [or if one buys the cpu retail one gets a suitable hsf with the cpu] not suitable for overclocking, but fine for normal use. 
probably get you into the 50's, without other efforts. 
next the problem is to put in enough case fans and to have the intake and exhaust fans located such that they are effective in keeping the interior temp where you want it. 
{you can buy a remote reading thermometer at radio shack and put the remote probe anywhere that you want inside the case to get a thermal map of the interior and then play with the fans}. 
i bought a cae that has a top case fan to exhaust out the top. 
we all know that heat rises. 
it is using a 2.6 ghz intel 800 fsb and max's at 42 c. 
overclockers buy all types of special cooling devices and hold theirs down in the low 30's. 
many cases have a side fan at the level of the cpu that brings outside air directly in towards the cpu/hsf it ain't up to intel. 
it's up to you. 
keep in mind that the new ddr memory runs hot as hades and the hard drives need cooling. 
thus you must circulate the air throughout the computer interior.
