3.} my dads computer has integrated and i still haven't decided which pci-e card i want for my main computer. 
how much can you spend on the video card? the 7600gt is the best choice for less than $200, the x1800xt and 7900gt tie for the $200-300 class, and the x1900xt is the best for $300-400. 
the x1900xtx and 7900gtx are the top-line cards, but it's hard to recommend them when an x1900xt performs so closely for $100 less.
