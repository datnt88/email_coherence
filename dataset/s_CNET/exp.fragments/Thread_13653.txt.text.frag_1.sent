i'm having trouble getting this card to function properly with my pc. i went through the installation procedures, and when i first start up the pc, i can see everything up to the windows loading progress bar screen. 
but after that, everything goes black. 
i imagine it could be some configuration problem, but i'm at a loss. 
btw, it's not a power supply problem, i have a 500w supply installed. 
does anyone have any ideas? 
thanks
