but i'm finding folk mis-diagnose the hibernate issue. 
that is, some are looking at the monitor that is displaying a sleep message and thinking the pc is sleeping or hibernating which is not the case at all. 
i find that a boot to safe mode and setting a compatible resolution can help if there are no other hardware issues. 
that step is not in your post so maybe it's the usual.
