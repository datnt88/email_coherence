even the moderators... consequently, people bend over backwards to help those with problems. 
many of your posts have been a bit unclear on this thread, while also containing a good bit of complaining. 
all of us here have been frustrated at one time or another so your frustration is understandable. 
taking your frustration out on those who have tried to help you is not so understandable. 
daring people to get you kicked out is just plain rude. 
i was a newbie here at cnet once, and someone gave me the same advice i will give you now. 
take a big breath, relax, and quit saying things that you may regret later. 
cheers grim
