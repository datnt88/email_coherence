in my experiance, most people can't use search engines to their maximum efficency. 
if you are looking for a 'how-to-hack' guide you need to look past simple blog sites. 
first, i am no expert in the matter but the fact is that with wireless networks may be. 
a) encrypted, meaning that to gain access to the data in the stream you need a decryption code and/or algorithm b) protected, to procure your own stream you need to meet certain requirements and send it to the router. 
encryptions is just a matter of procuring or generating an algorithm, and protected is just a matter of sniffing out the key. 
there is no 'safe' wireless network protocol because they all involve the transpher of infromation in the open. 
getting an encyption algorithm probally is much harder then simply breaking a protection seal, but it is not impossible.
