i've got the same drive with the same compaq replacement number on it. 
you are right in that the drive is an oem manufacure for compaq as entering the serial number in the seagate support site says it is an oem disk and support is provided by the oem (compaq in this case). the compaq definition of part number 192058-001 seems to be a 10gb ata66 ultraquiet drive and they (compaq)seem to have had an alteration made to the drive to make it behave like a 10gb disk. 
(very wasteful in my opinion making a 20gb drive act like a 10gb drive). 
i have gone a little further in trying to get it reset to 20gb but without sucess so far. 
i have tried upgrading the disk's firmware to the latest version and performing a low level format using seagate's sgatfmt4 utility. the format fails when it tries to access areas of the disk that lie outside of 10gb. 
anyone else got any ideas?
