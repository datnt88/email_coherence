i don't know if you availed yourself of the top post in this forum titled &quot;lost and found&quot; where we go over the usual do it yourself solutions. 
but you are learning the backup problem first hand. 
that is, &quot;storage&quot; is a misnomer. 
these things must have a backup copy. 
for example i bought an external then remembered my own admonishments and now have a second one that is synced with the first unit. 
wish i could bring myself to really get into the &quot;true state of backup&quot; with backup copy number three.
