hey everyone. 
my linksys wireless router is giving me a headache. 
the internet (through verizon) is connected to the westell modem. 
an ethernet connects the modem's ethernet port to the linksys router's internet port. 
port 1 is connected to a desktop computer which works perfectly. 
laptop 1 connects to the router and internet automatically and quickly, then stays connected to the internet. 
works perfectly. 
laptop 2 manually connects to the router occasionally, the internet rarely, and disconnects after ten minutes. 
____________________________________________________ now i know enough to post specs. 
if there are any more you need, please ask. 
modem: westell router: linksys, wireless-8 broadband router with 4-port switch, befw11s4 ver. 
4. laptop 1: acer aspire 5920, windows vista home premium, 32-bit. 
it is my mom's computer and has not had many things done with it. 
she doesn't touch advanced settings. 
laptop 2: acer aspire 5610, windows vista home premium, 64-bit. 
this is my computer, which i have tweaked. 
____________________________________________________ i know both laptops are connected to the same router name, and it is unsecured so there is no password to get wrong. 
when i can't connect laptop 2 to the router, i click diagnose. 
it tells me that a time-out occurred due to user action. 
anything that anyone can think of is appreciated!
