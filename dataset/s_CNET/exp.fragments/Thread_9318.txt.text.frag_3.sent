i probably shoud have said this in the first post, but it is a logitech keyboard and driver that i'm working with. 
any idea where to find the solution (or what to look for) on logitech's website? 
i was on there once already, but it was just a cursory search because i didn't expect to find anything. 
thanks for the tip!
