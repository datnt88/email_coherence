my main desktop is an hp pavilion which i bought in december of 2001. 
i just this week upgraded it to 2 gb ram and it's leaping around like an olympic jumper! 
a great machine, it seems to not be showing its age. 
2.4 ghz p4, with 2 gb ram, an 80 gb hd, a cd/dvd rw (burner) and all other stuff seems to have been brandy new, even though it is not. 
it works like a charm. 
my laptop is less than a year, and it runs vista sp1 like a new-born, no problems, it's an acer 5920 aspire, and is a joy to use. 
alas, i picked up a trojan and am going to rebuild it but that will take me all of an afternoon and it will be back in business. 
they're truly making better machines these days, and thanks to that, it is easier to deal with problems than it ever used to be. 
so, the 7 year old hp desktop pavilion, and the &gt; 1 yea old acer aspire laptop, and i couldn't be happier with my hardware. 
(once more, please forgive any glaring spelling errors ...).
