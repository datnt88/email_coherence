i noticed that the port on the linksys my d-link was plugged into was indicating it was under constant access (fast blinking light) so i changed the cable leading to my d-link to a different port, ipconfig /release then /renew on my windows pc and it came right up! 
(&gt;_&lt;;) looks like that port on my linksys is fried. 
thanks anyway, all.
