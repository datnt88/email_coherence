hey guys, i just wanted some feedback on the question of if i should replace my two year old asus k50ij laptop with the new asus transformer tf201. 
i'm mainly looking for a more portable alternative to a laptop to bring to my college classes and i'll also be mainly using it for extensive media consumption, i.e. video's, web surfing, games and such. 
one of the main reasons why i'm considering this so much is that i would have a desktop at home that has microsoft office loaded onto it. 
my plan is to at least be able to start word/powerpoints on the tablet and then be able to finish and edit them at home on the desktop. 
any suggestions/feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks!
