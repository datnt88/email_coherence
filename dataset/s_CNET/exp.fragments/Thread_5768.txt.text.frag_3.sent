how do i &quot;try cable select&quot; ? is that in the bios setup? 
this is new territory for me. 
i reattached the same cables used in the broken drive. 
thanks for your reply. 
p.s. i forgot to mention that my dvd drive did not appear either when i opened control panel. 
after removing the new cdrw it does appear.
