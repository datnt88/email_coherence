i have installed a wireless cnet card model cnwlc-811 and when it is plugged in it checks and blinks for a split second and then i get the red exclamation with the error listed in the subject line. 
(cnet wireless lan card lost). 
how can i fix this problem. the router is fine on the other computers. 
i am a novice so anyhelp would be good and an 800 number would be good to call cnet also. 
thanks m
