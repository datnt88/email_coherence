unfortunately, it's not that simple of a fix. 
read this thread for info: there's a bunch of threads on nvidia's forums also. 
recommend you uninstall all nvidia drivers and delete all your mobo/chipset devices in device manager. 
then reinstall the latest mobo software and the latest stable (non beta) graphics drivers.
