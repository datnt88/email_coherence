so i was helping a friend of mine get a computer and we found this computer( ) and this video card( ) i know they are both pci express but just to make sure did i miss something, or is the card compatible with the computer? 
i'm pretty sure that everything will go together, but if anything goes wrong it all gets blamed on me.
