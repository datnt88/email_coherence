to r.proffit: thanks for the clarification, i was not aware of the compatibility. 
my other worry about this is that the card won't operate to benchmarks b/c of the limitations in interface. 
to ramarc: for the price and the graphs my belief of nvidia is better than ati for gaming is changing. 
is it safe to assume that the performance charts did not have the video cards paired? 
i'll probably go with the 4830 unless anyone else has an opinion. 
thanks to you both for your help!
