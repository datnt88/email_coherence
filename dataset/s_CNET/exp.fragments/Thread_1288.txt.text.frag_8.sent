dual lasers...one for cd's...one for dvd's..either could be bad. 
if the dvd laser is gone then no dvd's will appear. 
if the cd laser is gone then no cd's will appear. 
the drive mechanism will work but no disk information will be read. 
i've read that the dvd laser is the one that usually goes. 
i bought a new dvd burner and had no problem with it. 
now i have an extra cd rom for my computer.
