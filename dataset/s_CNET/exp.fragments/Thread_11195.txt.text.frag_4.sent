its for pc games. 
i know ps2 emulators arent working good yet. 
i have one for my gamecube and it works when playing pc games like gta or halo. it worked before i reinstalled xp and now when i plug it ,it keeps saying usb device not recognized. 
i dont have the receipt and the adapter doesnt have a brand name except for radioshack.
