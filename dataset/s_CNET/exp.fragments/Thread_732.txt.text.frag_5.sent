most printers, canons included, go through a printhead clean cycle when they are first turned on. 
this makes some noise, but it should be no louder than when actually printing. 
i once had an hp printer that made a terrible chattering sound when printing, almost like gears grinding on one another! 
turned out that round shiny rail that the printhead assembly moves back and forth across the paper was dirty (and sticky). 
i cleaned it with a soft dry cloth and all was as quiet as a mouse! 
try it on yours - but don't use a lubricant of any kind, the rail is supposed to be dry and clean!
