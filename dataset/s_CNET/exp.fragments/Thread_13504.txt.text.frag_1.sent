hey, i am trying to connect a front panel (i'm not sure what type but it has 2 usb's, a mic, and a headphone jack. the 2 usb ports seem to worl already but the headphone and mic have never worked. 
i've recently discovered the retailer i bought it from didnt install it. 
i went to attach the wires to the motherboard and when i opened up the computer i saw there were 2 blue caps or something blocking the motherboard connections. 
they spanned 2 connections between bline_out_l and line out_l bline_out_r and line out_r does anyone know what these are for and if i can remove them? 
asus tech support isn't open right now and i'm anxious to do this. 
thanks
