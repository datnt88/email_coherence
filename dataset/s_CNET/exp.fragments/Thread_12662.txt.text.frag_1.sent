i am new to wireless networking and a somewhat slow learner. 
i use an adsl broadband service and have a home network of two desktop computers , one running winxp home edition, and the other runs win98se. 
i have installed a netgear modem/router dg834g, and netgear pci adapters wg311 v3 in each computer. 
the setup is working, more by good luck than management, i think! 
how do i setup the router firewall and wep or wpa now, with the router as it is in the centre of the house, and each pc approx. 
65 feet distant in other rooms? 
previously my network used ics, and the xp gateway machine was connected to the 98se machine with a cat5 crossover cable. 
i used the xp firewall on the gateway pc, and ran an av program on each, together with the usual clutch of anti parasite apps. 
of course, the gateway machine had to be running before the other machine was able to go online. 
now that the router is an access point, and each machine can go online independently of the other, i believe that i should set up the router firewall, to protect them both. 
i fear that the router will need to be physically connected to a computer to do this. is this correct please?
