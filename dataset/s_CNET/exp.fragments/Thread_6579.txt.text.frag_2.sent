you really didn't say much about the system you are using, os hardware, etc. so it is a bit hard to say what would function best. 
if you have a system that supports 1080p graphics then the lcd (with 1080p capability) would likely be a good way to go, hooking up via dvi or hdmi rather than vga, again it would depend on hardware and system capabilities. 
a little more info might help.
