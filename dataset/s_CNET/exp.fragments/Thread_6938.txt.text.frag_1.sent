lately, i've had a problem with my display when scrolling pages (on and off-line) and when dragging windows around. 
it'll go black and my monitor seems to reset and displace text and images when it reappears. 
i use windows xp. i don't know if this is a hardware problem, but it really annoys me. 
has anyone seen this before?
