windows ce machines are unlike your common pcs. 
there are no user serviceable parts and we can't change the os. if it's busted then its busted. 
i can only guess you are new to windows mobile/ce. 
i'm just a programmer (and more) and took the classes and seminars on windows mobile, embedded xp and more. 
as i am not the person who created this image, i can't do much other than help you learn a bit about this issue.
