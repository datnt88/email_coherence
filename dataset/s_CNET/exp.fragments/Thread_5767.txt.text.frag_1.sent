i'm upgrading my pc and i need some help choosing a graphics card. 
i'm a graphic designer working mostly with print design. 
i frequently work on some very large files (upwards of 200mb) in adobe photoshop cs, quarkxpress 6.5, illustrator, acrobat. 
my system has dual xeon 3.4ghz processors and 2gb ddr2 memory. 
i have a pci-express (16) slot available. 
should i go for 256mb or 512mb on the card? 
gefroce or quadro? 
firegl or radeon? 
i don't do 3d work, but i hear windows vista may have some 3d in it. 
any advice? 
i'd like to get the optimal card without overkill.
