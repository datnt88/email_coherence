it appears you have an atx type powered system. 
all you need is to &quot;momentarily&quot; hit the on/off sw. for it to turn on. 
if you keep depressing the sw., it will start to shutdown. 
that's normal for the system to do. the only thing i can think if it doesn't do this prorperly is a flaky sw. or one that gets stuck/sticky. 
these are simple sw. and shouldn't cause problems. 
i suggest maybe a quick squirt of wd-40 or similar at the sw. area if a sticky button, otherwise replace sw. if determined to be bad. 
good luck -----willy
