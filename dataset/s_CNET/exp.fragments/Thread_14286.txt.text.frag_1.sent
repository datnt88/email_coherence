i have server 2003 and win xp pro work stations. 
i've created a policy that i want to enforce on a user that will change the work station for that individual. 
i created a work station policy but want different user's to have different rights. 
when i attach the server policy it does'nt restrict the work station as it should. 
i must be missing something ?
