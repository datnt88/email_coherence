everyone is familiar with microsoft's subtle, gentle pushes to upgrade to the latest and newest and more expensive software, e.g. &quot;we will no longer provide security packs or updates to this version of windows after this date.&quot; 
what's the word with win xp? i agree with you, i see no point in moving to vista. 
my wife can get an outrageous educator discount, my system will handle everything but the highest aero demands (128mb pcie card) but i'm having a hard time figuring out &quot;why&quot;. 
win xp was a phenomenal jump over windows 98se in terms of stability, usability, pnp, security, etc. but i don't see the radical need this time. 
i know adoption of vista has gone well but is not replacing xp all over the world. 
sooo...... anyone heard any rumors about how long microsoft will continue to support win xp before putting it out to pasture?
