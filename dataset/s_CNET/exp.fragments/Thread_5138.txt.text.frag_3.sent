i have a router/cable modem combo provided by the cable company. 
it's a netgear wireless cable modem gateway cg814wg. 
i don't have my own wireless router. 
i am able to see my own wireless network on my laptop, but i am not able to connect to it since it wants a wap network id number and i don't know what that is. 
thanks in advance
