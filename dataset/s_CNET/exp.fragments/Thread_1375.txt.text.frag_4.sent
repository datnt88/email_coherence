if you had the motherboard for a couple off years it may be and agp slot. 
if it is an agp slot you can not put and pci express card in that slot. 
if the slot is a different color than your pci slots it most likely is a video card slot, but you got to make sure which one agp or pci express slot. is this a computer you built or is it store bought. 
if it is store bought supply us with the make and model #. thank you: wendell h
