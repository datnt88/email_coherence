thank-you - that was interesting. 
i took a look at live mesh - i'll try it. 
it looks like it does what team viewer does plus the sync. 
for me it will help to sync my desktop and laptop when they are both online. 
a pity however it cannot use my nas like it uses skydrive to sync when either is not online - but that is not the way the industry is going - they aren't happy enough with high software prices - they want us all dependent and on monthly subscriptions.
