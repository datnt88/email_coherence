i have heard a lot of reviews and testimonials on the internet about these two forms of encryption. 
i was wondering..which is better to run? 
on average how long would it take to crack each level of encryption...and how much would a 128 bit wep slow down the network when compared to 64 bit wep. 
any opinions?
