after reading all the comments everywhere on the net, uninstalling firefox and reinstalling, nothing worked. 
(like you, it worked on ie). 
apparently the cause was a ms update. 
i just right-clicked the printer in the printers and devices folder and removed the printer (with the printer off). 
then i turned the printer on. 
the drivers were automatically installed and voila! 
everything worked.
