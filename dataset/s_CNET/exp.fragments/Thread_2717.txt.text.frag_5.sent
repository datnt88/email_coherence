how well it will work in your pc. two thiongs buy from relable place such as newegg, get lifetime warranty. 
go to the computer mfr's website to see if they have data on memory that they have qualified for that system. 
unfortunatley your proprietary vendor may not do that because he wants to sell you his at double the price. 
newegg warranty is to replace with like item, however, if necessary they will allow an rma for a full refund if talked to nicely. 
and if you want to buy a higher priced item have done that by starting the rma, buying the new one and eventually getting credit for the returned item. 
they process such transactions rather smoothly, no bs.
