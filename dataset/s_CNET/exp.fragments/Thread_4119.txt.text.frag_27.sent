1. check your system properties and make sure all your ram is available. 
had the same problem and found one of my ram not making proper contact. 
2. download cc cleaner and iobit system optimizer and run both. 
you can get both at download.com. 
3. i have 1.5 gig of ram, 2,26 processor and nvidia 7300 gt graphics and can play virtually any game at full specs without problem. 
busy with fallout 3 at the mo. iobit also have a add-on called gamebooster that works extremely well. 
just remember to go back to normal mode when u are finished
