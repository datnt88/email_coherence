1. windows xp activation kicks in and since the os is not on a emachines board, fails. 
no big surprise here. the license was for the emachine and it's not an emachine any more. 
2. the repairs for xp i noted are for most oem (not brand names) and retail versions of xp. in the future be sure to reveal the details so we can make faster progress. 
i think finding a new emachine board could be the cheap fix here.
