just bought myself a new motherboard & amd cpu. 
while building my new system, some of thermapaste got leaked into the cpu socket placement (i inserted cpu, put the paste on top of cpu and put the heatsink/fank on top.. but i didn't like the placement of my heatsink/cpu so i took it out, and took out the cpu but some of the thermapaste got leaked) i tried to clean it with a paper towel, it wasn't too serious of a leak but now.. nothing will start (my cpu fan won't run) im trying to start from a barebone (just ram, cpu, and powersupply) i checked the placement for pw switch and it is in the right placement.. would a little thermapaste leak cause enough trouble to mess up my cpu & motherboard, or do i need a new power supply? 
(380 watt power supply.. brand new as well)
