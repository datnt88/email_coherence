3i have seen more problems with hijacked browsers in the last month or so than any time in the past. the systems with the problems run extremely slow and get constant popups as well as being redirected almost all the time to web sites that appear to be help sites but aren't. 
does this describe anything you are seeing? 
if it does then you need to download adaware (lavasoftusa.com) and cwshredder for starters and try and clean your system up with them. 
another cause of the problem you describe is a bad hard drive that is just starting to go.
