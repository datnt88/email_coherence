thanks to everyone for replying. 
i will apply the suggestions you have offered. 
a little about me. 
i am a therapist who recently got a donated computer given to me, with a box of parts, and a motherboard. 
i asked for a case, and ended up with a lot of older computers (166 win 95 type of machines) i decided to start to rehab them for children and needy families. 
i started papabearcares . 
i am learning as i go, and am learning to ask questions. 
luckly, i have a number of spare parts now so if a component is bad, i can replace it. 
one day i will probably get into the classroom for more formal training. 
thanks again for your help.
