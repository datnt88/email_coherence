both are ide hard drive. 
i have two hard drive partition, master drive is windows xp and other is the windows 7 beta that just released(slave drive). 
i wiped out the second hdd with darik's boot and nuke to stop the dual boot. 
it didn't work. 
so i right click my computer -&gt; manage -&gt; device manager -&gt; disk drive -&gt; right click -&gt; uninstall the hdd still didn't stop the dual boot but now i cannot see the 2nd hdd in my computer anymore. 
i just want the second hdd to become the slave and not another dual boot?
