one of the nvidia 7600gt graphics cards connected to my evga board stopped working. 
when i pulled it out i noticed 4 of those round capacitors had broken tops. 
as if something had exploded through it. 
one capacitor on the other card is the same. is that supposed to happen, when the card gets old or too hot? its only 2 years old this is my first time seeing a graphics card and putting a system together can anyone explain this? 
thanx for any information.
