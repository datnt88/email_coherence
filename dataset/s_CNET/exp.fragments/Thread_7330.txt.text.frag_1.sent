i am in the process of trying to make to most of my new super-router. 
one of the challenges is to allow two work laptops tied to respective corporate domains to share not only the basic wlan/internet connection (that bit works already), but also to use the hp laserjet 10221 printer connected via usb to the wl-700ge and hopefully also access the disk drive. 
my home network is a windows workgroup (w2k pro sp4) and i cannot change the network settings of the work laptops (with windows xp). 
i there a way to solve this problem? 
thanks in advance p.s. imho, asus has some unutilized opportunities to improve the wl-700ge manual...
