i'm calm now i had been searching the internet for a few days and getting no where. 
i don't know what to unplug. 
i'm not computer savy in the department of hardware but a friend of mine may be able to help me do that. the fan in the middle by the power button comes on, however the fan behind the cd drive doesn't come on.
