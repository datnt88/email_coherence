i just went to cable from dial up. 
got five email addresses. 
decided to keep records of which email is used where. 
i used one of them for one time, to go to linux central to buy a knoppix cd. i am now getting spam mail against that email address which has been used only once. 
what can i do to report this?? any ideas.
