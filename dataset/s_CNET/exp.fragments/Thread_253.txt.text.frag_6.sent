apparently it should be fine with xbox`s........doesnt seem so thus far ? 
i have been on to support at netgear and still awaiting there feedback ???? you`d expect investing good money for a product that the product would be up to par. 
all i am after is a good device to store and stream my media from ....starting to think i should have just invested in a nas drive but the reason i went for this was to have the dual band to share with my devices........
