no! the powerbook video card, it's built onto the the logicboard, is not replaceable. 
you have an ati rage mobility 128 video controller with agp 2x, 14.1-inch tft the vram is not expandable. the good news is that the processor can be replaced, for a fee. 
i'm not sure that i would bother with the expense given that i would still not be able to play the game. 
i would be able to not play it faster though:-) you may be able to play an earlier version of simcity. the cheapest upgrade route that i could find for you to be able to play simcity 4, is $499.00. 
that will exceed the system requirements for this game.
