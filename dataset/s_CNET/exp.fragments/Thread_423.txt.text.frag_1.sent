bought new dell dimension 8400 with 250 gb hard drive and xp professional. 
thinking of purchasing a 250 gb or 300 gb external drive for backup. 
i like what i have read about the dantz retrospect 7 professional software. 
will definitely automate backup. 
which drive would you purchase? 
lacie or maxtor? 
appreciate you helping me out!
