hi, i have a store 'n' go usb 1gb that i bought a while ago, i have problem opening the disk so, i had to format it. the system keeps telling me that the drive is copy protected on windows xp, and the files on the drive are copy protected and it is read-only files and i should have read help files on how to deal with read-only files on windows vista ultimate. 
however, i am unable to see if there are any files on the drive nor to open it or use it for anything. 
i have tried to format it on different computers, different operating systems, and using the c-command, no progress i still got the same response. 
the formation process was using the default allocation , 1024, and quick and normal format. 
no progress. 
help me, i need to reformat it and just reuse it.
