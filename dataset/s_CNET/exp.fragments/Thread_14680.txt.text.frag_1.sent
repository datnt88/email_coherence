i have two routers, one wired and another one wireless. 
i have conected my cable modem to the wired router, and one connection from the router goes to the wan input of the wireless router. 
when i conect my laptop to the wireless router via wirelesss adapter, i am able to browse the internet, but i cannot see the computer connected to the wired router. 
ip address range of the wired router starts from 192.168.8.17 (the router itself is 192.168.8.1) whereas the address range of the wireless router starts from 192.168.0.100 (the router itself is 192.168.0.1) what can i do to make sure that computers on both wired and wireless networks can see each other?
