i set my screen resolution at a setting that my monitor couldn't display. 
now i get a black screen every time i try and turn on my computer. 
i don't get the usual boot up screen either. 
i can boot up when i connect to the motherboard, but not when i use my graphics card. is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution?
