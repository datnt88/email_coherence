hello all i'm looking to purchase a 500 gb external hard drive to do backups. 
my computer is win xp sp3 with usb 2.0 ports. 
i have norton ghost v 15. i've researched and have seen both good and bad for both seagate and wd drives. 
realizing individuals wants/needs/opinions are specific to an individual, i would like some feedback on what people think of the above manufacturers and the various drives they produce. 
i'm leaning towards a desktop external rather than a portable, just for the sake of the desktop having a connection to a power supply that's not the computer. 
this drive would be used once a week, explicitly for backing up the internal drive. 
however, i am not adverse to purchasing 2 drives and doing a 'double' backup every week. 
any comments are appreciated. 
thanks
