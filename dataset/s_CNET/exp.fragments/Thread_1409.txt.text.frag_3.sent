not much of a use...wait till vista... dont think u can dual boot 2 versions of xp u will need a motherboard. 
list the specs of your current computer...such as ram specs? 
motherboard? 
processor? 
etc. processor...right now i would go with an amd athlon x2 3800+. 
amd outperforms intel and runs cooler. 
ram...dpeending on whether u can salvage case: your choice... powersupply- i would recommend antec, seasonic, enermax, pc power and cooling, has to be at least 400-450watts optical drives- dvd burner? 
and for the graphics card? 
i dont think it is that good...and considering the prices of graphics cards have dropped so much.... i would recommend the 6800gs which can be had for about $160. 
if u want to spend like 100-150 more...get the newer 7900gt. 
but both are way faster than the 9600 u use. 
with a better graphics card, you can play newer games or older games at higher resoultions and settings and have much better visual quality. 
and keyboard, mouse, speakers, and monitor
