alright so we just bought a new belkin n router. the only way for my computer to be connected is for it to be wirelessly connected. 
but the wireless adapter i have isn't detecting the network. 
i've got a d-link g usb adapter. is there any way to make the wireless adapter g adapter compatible with my n router? 
i've also got a belkin g wireless adapter, is there any way to make that compatible as well?
