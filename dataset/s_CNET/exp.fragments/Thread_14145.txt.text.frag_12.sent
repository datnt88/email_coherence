i ordered a 512 ibm microdrive from the computer memory store.com over 2 weeks ago. 
received e-mail confirmation that credit card was charged and order was being sent. 
nothing yet! have sent several e-mails inquiring about order. the 1 888 295-6064 number is worthless, they are not taking calls at this time according to the recording. 
i needed that microdrive this next weekend!
