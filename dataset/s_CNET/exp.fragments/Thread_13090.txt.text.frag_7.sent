at that time the tab 2 wasn't out yet. 
i bought it for the display and i prefer android over apple. 
of the 3 in your post 1. samsung galaxy tab 2 - nice display, lots of android app available 2. ipad2 - most applications and easy to use. 
3. asus nexus - cheaper and smaller screen, access to lots of android apps. 
4. the new entry the surface rt - the windows market is new and not as many applications but it's growing. 
it odes have microsoft office, only available in windows store (online or the retail stores) late to the competition.
