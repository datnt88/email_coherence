i have looked at some resovled questions here and am a little reluctant to post, but this is a serious security difficulty. 
so please help if you possibly can suggest something! 
tks - os: win 7 starter 2 gb ram been on search for a router for a hp mini 2100 series with a mobile usb port modem (as in what cellular companies are selling for portable connection, you know, the usb port stick type). the modem plugs directly into the mini 2.0 usb port and provides internet access at home or mobile. 
called hp support and they sold me a cisco linksys (3200 i believe), quite expensive, that didn't work because this modem has no ethernet ports or cables and the cisco linksys no usb ports to plug modem into. the hp mini 2100 has no ethernet rj-45 connector either. 
had to be returned. 
bought a modem from an online company, cradlepoint, that advertised a router as being confirmed to work with my isp, clearwire, and my usb port modem. 
slowed the system down to below dialup speeds with any &quot;firmware&quot; software they could furnish for windows 7 starter edition with wireless n capability. 
had to be returned. 
this is a wimax 4g signal running at 2.5 (not your typical 2.4) . the modem itself is a ubee 1900 from china. 
nothing seems to work as a router. 
clearwire offers one hotspot, g wireless, with security level wep, i think. 
not too attractive in terms of security; don't know if that &quot;apollo&quot; router offered by clear would work. 
anyone solved this problem of a router accepting a usb port modem and that one can connect to wirelessly thereafter and that's still portable?
