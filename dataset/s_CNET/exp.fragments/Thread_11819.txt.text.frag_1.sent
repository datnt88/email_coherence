a couple of weeks ago, i was blissfully using my computer, minding my own business, when the screen flickered and dimmed as it switched over to battery power. 
i'd had problems with a/c adapters with other computers in the past, so i assumed it was a short in the wire. 
moving the cord around a little briefly got it back on a/c power, but even that quickly stopped working and i could see the battery was draining. 
(i hardly ever use the battery, so i guess it's no surprise.) i had enough time to save many large directories to an external hard drive before i shut down. 
i called dell to order a new adapter, but they told me they no longer stocked the model i needed as my laptop is one and a half years old (!!!), but they could send me a &quot;travel&quot; adapter for more money. 
i agreed. 
but when i received the travel adapter the next day and tried it out, i discovered my computer was running very slowly and the adapter was getting extremely hot. 
i returned the travel adapter to dell and found the regular adapter on ebay listed as new. 
my computer ran fine with the new adapter for several days, then switched over to battery again with no warning. 
this time moving the cord had no effect, and the battery drained even faster then before. 
i quickly shut down all my programs and turned off the computer just before it drained completely. 
so, perhaps i got a faulty adapter off ebay, but now i'm wondering if my problem is really the battery. 
i'm reluctant to try returning the adapter only to get a new one from ebay, plug anything in and turn it on, only to have something fry because the problem was elsewhere. 
any advice on what i should try next?p
