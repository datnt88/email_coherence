i've been reading through the forums today, and there are a lot of threads asking for opinions. 
it's been great except that nobody seems to want the same tablets i do. 
i'm at a crossroads. 
i'm going to be using my tablet for reading, web browsing, occasional gaming, some movies, and development. 
my battle is between the samsung galaxy note 10.1 and the google nexus 10. i'm drawn to the stylus feature of the note, but i've also heard it's buggy at times. 
on the flip side i'm really drawn to the screen quality of the nexus 10. i'm also a big fan of having the direct google connection to os updates first. 
if you who are reading this were posed this question, which tablet would you choose?
