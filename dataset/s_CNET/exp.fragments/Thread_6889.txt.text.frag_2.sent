hai till this date, i have been a preferred dell customer. 
i have bought nearly 7 laptops from dell (for me and my friends). 
they have a wonderful price range, awesome components to choose from and customer support. 
never had a problem with them. 
if u really need to compare ur deal made with hp, go to dell.com and compare the same configuration with dell. 
u will certainly going to feel like a looser. 
dont give people a wrong impression just because u r not able to live up with the world. 
i mean to say &quot;usa is not the only country which speaks english&quot; all the best with ur computer
