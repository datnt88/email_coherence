kallimo, i owned an espson stylus cx-5400 for my windows computer and cx-6600 for my mac. the cx-5400's printer head died.....according to all the complaints on the internet, this model was &quot;defective&quot;. 
i returned it to epson and it was replaced by a stylus cx-6000 which is still (cross fingers) working but now the cx-6600 just died. 
i don't know if this is due to the &quot;durabrite&quot; ink or not. 
but, with epson, a new ink cartridge just contains ink. 
with hp, for example, a new cartridge also includes new print heads. 
if i didn't also own a canon printer, also, i would be out of luck.
