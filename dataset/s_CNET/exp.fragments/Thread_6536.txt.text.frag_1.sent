i have a dell dimension 2400 and i was board one day so i opened up the case (not the first time). 
while i was doing so i decided to move a pci card over one slot to give my video card a bit more room to breath when i noticed that there was something that seems to be a layout for putting an agp slot in. 
it is slighty farther back then the pci slots (like all the agp slots i have seen on motherboards) and it is the top slot (if there was a slot). 
to get to the point, is it possible to buy an agp slot so i can use agp video cards?
