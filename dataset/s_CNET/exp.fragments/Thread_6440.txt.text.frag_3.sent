formatting requires space. 
imagine a book with 300 pages. 
it has a title page, an index, appendix, maybe a glossary, and there has to be space for pages numbers. 
a certain number of pages have to devoted to keeping track of where data is located. 
it's the same way with your flash drive. 
a certain amount of those 8 gb are dedicated to keeping track of where everything is located.
