i have an old iomega ext zip drive, ya know with that plug with the hundred pins. 
db25 i guess??? of course all of my current computers have usb ports. is there an adaptor i can buy to use the old zip drive with my new computers? 
or any way at all to get info from those 100 zip disks onto something else?
