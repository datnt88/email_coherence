two ways to do this. 
you can buy a stick that is the same speed as the installed ram and hope the two sticks will play nice together. 
or. if you have 40 bucks you can remove the original stick and install a 8gb kit. the kit will have two matched sticks that will play nice together and use the dual channel feature with no fuss. 
1600 speed is the max your machine will support.......that's the target i'd shoot for. 
in your other post you talk about testing this for best perf. 
w7 comes with a bench mark tool called.....windows experience index......run that thru google. 
you can use that and test different configs of ram.......see what the tool shows.
