i have done so much to this machine win98se, and i have tried to install suse and mandrake linux, and even my xp software from another computer=it fails any installation of operating system. 
i have partitioned and formatted and over and over. 
i had win98 dos on the c drive but since i tried to install xp, can't even get dos now. 
made an xp boot disc and that won't bring up fdisk, i can get to the bios and it is fine. 
otherwise i now have nothing. 
something is locking the drive or preventing complete install. 
how to unlock the drive? 
i did run dps ide in bios and it came up fine. 
don't know what to do now.
