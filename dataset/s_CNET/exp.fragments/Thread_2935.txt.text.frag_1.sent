what i want to do: have my hp pc desktop hardwired to the internet and my macbook wirelessly to the net via my airport. 
i have a dsl modem and a 3 year old airport extream. 
i would also like to be able to share a hp printer between the two but that is not critical. the macbook/airport has been functional for a couple of years; am adding the pc desktop into the mix. 
how do i do this?
