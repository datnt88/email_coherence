the pc is probably from 1999 or so. 
i got it from a friend and put a pentium iii 500mhz processor and it has 768 of ram. 
i tried all the pci slots and also verified the pnp option in the cmos is enabled. 
i flashed the bios using the mi413 one from this site: . 
i also uninstalled sp2 and reinstalled xp without any luck.
