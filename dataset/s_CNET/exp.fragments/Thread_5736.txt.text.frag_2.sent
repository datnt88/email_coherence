i've yet to see any solution that kept consistent performance as there are variables such as make, model or the laptops or slight location differences let a laptop edge out others and look preferred. 
to solve this might require a rack of gear to met out the packets at a set rate. 
sounds expensive. 
the setup is sound, common, works but your question might mean there are other goals. the number of open connections is rarely a factor of the router. 
why? 
tcp/ip. 
i can't duplicate this as it's pretty well documented on the net.
