the answer about the apple displays is simply that the design is pretty spiffy, matches the apple hardware so you pay a designer price. 
in norcal i bet you have a wide array of choices. 
so set your price point and start shopping with that connection type in mind. 
as to 17 or 19 i have both (home, office) and the 19 is spacious in comparison.
