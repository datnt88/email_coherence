hi all, i have recently tried to install a new video card into my old computer, the computer was built by me so its not as if i'm just bolting parts to an oem. 
in any case i installed the new video card (xfx radeon hd 4650, agp) into my pc and it looks like safe mode, i have tried to uninstall and reinstall the drivers multiple times, using the drivers off the install disk, and the newest ones from ati/amd. 
still get a safe mode-like screen. 
i put my old card back in it (asus x850 extreme) and it worked. 
so, i was wondering if there is maximum amount of graphics a mother board could handle? 
here are my specs: well... i reached the end of the allowed characters... i will post in a reply.
