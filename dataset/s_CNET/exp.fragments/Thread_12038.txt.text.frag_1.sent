i have an hp officejet 5510xi all-in-one printer that im having trouble with. 
when i have it connected to my desktop it takes forever to print just one page. 
i mean maybe 5 minutes or more to print one page. 
when i hook it up to my laptop it prints just fine. 
normal speed and everything. is there anything i need to do on my desktop computer that would fix the slow printing problem?
