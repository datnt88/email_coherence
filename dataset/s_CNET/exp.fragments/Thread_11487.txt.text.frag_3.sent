well i would change the wireless setting meaning you ssid name to something other than what the default name of the router is. 
then you need to change the password and just my suggestion because it is known to work and there is less holes in the encryption is to use wep 128 bit encryption and change the password from admin to whatever you want. 
i would do all this by consoling into the wireless router by typing the ip addess into the web browser.make 
sure you are hard wired into the wireless router into the internet port once you have connected your isp modem to the router. 
for linksys i know it is 192.168.1.1 and that will take you into the router. 
you also need to setup the drivers and so forth. 
anyway i hope that helps and if not let me know if this did not make sense.
