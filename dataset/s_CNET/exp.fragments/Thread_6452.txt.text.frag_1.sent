i have been recently using up a lot of storage space on my computer ( 275gb out of 350gb) and my pentium 4 processor seems to be taking a long time opening applications ( it take me 16 seconds to open word 07!! ) my current intel pentium 4 is measured at 3.4ghz- is there any point investing in a slower 2.0ghz core 2 duo? 
my motherboard is compatible and i have a ati hd3850 as a video card
