thanks for the reply. 
i'm sorry, i forgot to make clear that my windows pc -is- what is connected to my d-link. 
i don't understand why i can't log back into the d-link from my windows pc using the address i assigned to the d-link. 
i -can- do that, but only until the d-link or the windows pc are rebooted, then it doesn't work.
