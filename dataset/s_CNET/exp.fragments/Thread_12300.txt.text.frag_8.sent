it's just easier that way. 
sometimes i find that having all the questions in one post leads to a bigger picture of what's causing the issues. 
also, this forum software is just not that great. 
you can save people a lot of time by just posting a numbered list of questions and letting everyone eat away at it. 
make it easy on everyone if you don't mind.
