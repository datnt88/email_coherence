i have learned some lessons over time and i've progressed so far. 
it's ironic that this post came up too because i just had an external hard drive go on me! 
i had purchased a maxtor onetouch iii 320gb external hard drive to backup to and it was good until about a month ago (14 months of occasional and not being plugged in). the enclosure first had a short then the pcb (printed circuit board) fried. 
by the way if anybody has a seagate st3320620a with firmware 3.aad, help please! 
learn from me, as enticing a retail buy may be, build your own external hard drive. 
if you know how to install ram and reformat a drive, you have the right skills to do it. 
do your research on types of hard drives if you're not sure about terms and types of hard drives are on the market. 
my best advise would be to find a pair of identical hard drives and an enclosure with raid1 (array of hard discs) with mirror support. 
depending on what you want in terms of capacity, it'll probably cost a couple hundred. 
in most cases, your choices may cost less than buying retail. 
don't forget to look for an enclosure which can dissipate heat and maybe have a fan. 
a raid1 is my next action in saving my data. 
i hope this time it works to my advantage!
