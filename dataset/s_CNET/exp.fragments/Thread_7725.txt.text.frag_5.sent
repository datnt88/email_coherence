didn't get the answer you were asking for did you? the one guy that said you don't need much because of todays standards was right. 
if it were me though, i would definitly go with the sony. 
they are better quality computers. 
i prefer custom built but in your situation, i would buy the sony. 
xp pro and office xp. 
don't forget the amd processor instead of the intel. 
sony + amd = toyota camry vs. ford escort. 
lol!
