maybe try this page. 
i've got the very same router as you on xp pro with one other desktop and a dell inspiron 1100. 
i've had no problems with this router for the past 6 months, and no problems upgrading the firmware. 
it could also be the network adapter in your laptop ----- not the router. 
i wish i had an answer for you.
