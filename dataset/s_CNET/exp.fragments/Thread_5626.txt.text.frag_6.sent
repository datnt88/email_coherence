thanks bob - parasites are certainly a possibility and i did read the info you provided to another post. 
i was experiencing hijacks on the web, etc. but thought i had cleaned them well enough and protected my machine. 
i now use stopzilla as a pop up blocker which seems to work very well. 
could a parasite be causing random locks and improper boots repeatedly - and why would the machine boot properly one time and not the next on power up? 
could it be that simple - blasted parasites and hijack code?
