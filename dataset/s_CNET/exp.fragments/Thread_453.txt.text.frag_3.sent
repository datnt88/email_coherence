i've used standalone flatbed scanners besides a deskjet printer but as my number of dedicated desktops (one for audio work, one for video work and another for financial transactions) space has become a premium. 
an hp c5500 all in one unit fit the bill with scanning up to 2400 dpi and the same for the printer with exemplary photo performance. 
if space is a factor the aio unit is called for and for a home network becomes essential.
