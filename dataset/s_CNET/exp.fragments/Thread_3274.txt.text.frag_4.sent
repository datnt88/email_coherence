kees, many thanks for the reply! 
yes, we plan to purchase an english (us i guess) keyboard. 
we found this french page with some computers with the english version of windows 7 (some are vista but we don't want that): the one that caught our attention is: compaq sg3-110uk (version anglaise) for 349 euro what do you think about this one or is there any other on that page you would go for? 
thanks again
