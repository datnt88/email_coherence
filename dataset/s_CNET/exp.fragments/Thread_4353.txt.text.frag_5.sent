ya bob i thick the mobo has failed me. 
well that goes to show that lenovo has failed me too. 
just less then 2 years usage. 
my other older acer is already 5 years and my son is still happily playing his online games and does his homework on it. 
well i guess i will get a new cpu and this time i will make sure its not a lenovo. 
thanks bod for all your quick responds by the way i think this forum is cool. 
cheers james
