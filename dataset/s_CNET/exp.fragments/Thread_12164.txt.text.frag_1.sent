as some of you might know from previous posts im planning on buying a computer and i saw that the amd processor is much cheaper than the intel processor and i wonder if there is any bigger difference between these two computers: amd: cooler master centurion 5 miditower black/silver without psu chieftec cft-500a-12s 500w atx/dualx eps-12v 120mm fan 20/24-pin (amd&p4 ok) gigabyte ga-ma790fx-ds5 amd790fx 4ddr2-dimm 2pci 5pcie sata raid audio gb-lan firewire socket am2+ atx samsung sh-s203d/bebn dvdrw dual-layer 20x black bulk sata processor: amd phenom 9850 black edition quad-core 2.5ghz 4x1mb (l2+l3) 125w boxed (with cpu-cooler!) socket am2+ ram: a-data 2048mb ddr2 pc2-6400 800mhz hdd: samsung hd501lj 500gb 7200rpm 16mb sata2 graphics: bfg geforce 9800gx2 1024mb ddr3 tv-out hdtv dual dvi retail pci express os: windows vista home premium 32-bit dvd svensk oem intel: cooler master elite 332 miditower without psu chieftec cft-500a-12s 500w atx/dualx eps-12v 120mm fan 20/24-pin (amd&p4 ok) gigabyte ga-ep35-ds3 ip35 4ddr2-dimm 3pci 4pcie sata raid audio gb-lan socket775 atx samsung sh-s203d/bebn dvdrw dual-layer 20x black bulk sata processor: intel core 2 quad q9450 2.66ghz 12mb fsb1333 boxed (with cpu-cooler!) socket 775 (the other components are all the same as on the amd computer) now, the price of the amd processor ($ 296) is lower than the intel processor ($ 440) but what are the other differences between these processors? 
ive heard that amd processors are better for gaming (which i will use it for) is it therefore better to buy the amd processor? 
any other tips/recommendations on the computer as a whole are appreciated.
