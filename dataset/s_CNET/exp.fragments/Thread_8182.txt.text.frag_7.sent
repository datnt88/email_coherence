indicates sata-type drives for the g5. perhaps it is as simple most all drives of that type would work just fine -- that is certainly the experience i've had with the non-sata ide drives that are used in my mac g4. the same drives available to pc seem compatible so far. 
i presume you have a more definitive answer from western digital by now, but i should think the drive you mentioned will work, either internally or in an external enclosure. 
good quality external enclosures in which you install an internal ide drive are another option and seem quite compatible connected as either usb or firewire on a mac running os-x. 
i don't have experience with sata drives in such an enclosure, however.
