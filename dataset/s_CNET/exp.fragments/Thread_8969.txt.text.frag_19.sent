once. was doing an upgrade to my compaq, rather than spend money on buying a new computer that still wouldn't have all i wanted. 
everything went fine with adding my additional hardware and improvements (ram, slave drive, audio system, temp/fan controllers, etc.) until the install of the multi-card reader. 
i left it for last knowing that the install would re-designate some drive letters (except &quot;c&quot;). 
i thought all went well until i went to reboot. 
suddenly i had a failure to boot. 
i went nuts for a day and finally handed it to my local tech, unable to figure it out myself. 
he reported that the install of the card reader &quot;made the boot partition on the c drive become the b drive. 
since the computer will only boot from c and the boot partition was now designated as a b drive, it doesn't exist on c and therefore won't boot&quot;. he had to reformat the hard drive, which was heartbreaking because of the years of pics and info lost (i finally get around to buying a slave drive and auto save program, but still lost the info!). i'm no techie, but am curious. 
he said this often happens when installing a card reader on hp's and compaq's. 
anyone else ever hear of this happening?
