i have been trying to connect to the internet and to the other computers that are both on the lan. 
i get the following messages on the two frequently used computers on the lan: status: limited or no connectivity you might not be able to access the internet or some network resources. 
this problem occurred because the network did not assign a network adress to the computer. 
if clicking repair does not restore connectivity, the problem might be with the network, not with this computer&quot; i tried to repair and this was unsuccessful. 
i updated my lavasoft ad-aware se professional ref. file (23.03.2005) recently and i read something about some people having network problems after. 
i am using an ibm thinkpad (xp professional sp 2, intel pentium m 1400mhz 598 mhz. 
256 mb of ram). 
i had to connect to internet via 56k modem. 
i just updated ref. file (11.04.2005) on this ibm and i am now up-to-date on windows update. the other computer is a &quot;clone&quot; (correct term?) running xp home sp 2, pentium 4,...) the lan was running perfect 2 days ago up to now and i checked all cables. 
dsl modem says all go. is there any other information u need? 
i need my internet back!
