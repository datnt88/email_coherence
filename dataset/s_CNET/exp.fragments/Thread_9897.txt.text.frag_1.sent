i have a windows xp sp3 pc with the generic bt 5.1.26 radio driver and the same version. 
windows bt enumerator i am having no trouble adding an android device ( htc evo ) however, there is no connection held after the successful password matching....... is there a newer driver that will help this connection error? 
thanks.
