i have an old dlink di-604 that i'd like to configure to work as a switch. 
i think this is possible but not sure how to do it. 
switches are cheap but if i could save a few bucks with some tweaking i'd prefer that. 
plus i figure i'd learn a bit about networking. 
dlinks site on the di-604: my main problem is i have uverse and i'm out of wired ports on the residential gateway. 
i would like 2 more ports to network my pc and nas, so my laptop and xbox can access their files.
