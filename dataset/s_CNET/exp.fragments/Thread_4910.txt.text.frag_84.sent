thanks for updating with your latest. it would be great if everyone that did install the latest 1-16-08 bios flash would check in with their results. 
so far, it's been a good sign for those with this last update. 
anyone can set this thread's updates to track to their email, too. the irony for me is i dont even own a gateway, currently working on a custom machine. 
but i was interested in a marked down 5632 as a base system, hence this thread and the interest in the bios solution.
