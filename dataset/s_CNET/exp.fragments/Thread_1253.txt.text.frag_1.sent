i get my high speed internet by connecting my 3g phone to my computer.this is my only source for internet i cannot get dsl or cable. 
i want to set up a wireless network in my house for my tv and wii. 
conventional wireless routers do not apply and i need to know if this is possible. 
i am using a pc running vista and the phone is a samsung propel.
