a few yrs. 
ago a small &quot;simplified pc&quot; was promoted for a short while. 
it was just for email & internet connections; maybe w/ an integrated screen. 
i want just that for a second home in fl......as cheaply as possible; for email & to pay bills. 
small size would be a plus as well. 
a really cheap notebook would be ideal, but they're not so cheap in my eyes. 
any suggestions are welcome. 
thanks.
