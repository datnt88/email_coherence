i have exactly the same problem with a maxtor 250 gb hd in an icy box enclosure, xp, firewire-access and motherboard doesn't support usb2 either. 
the disc is still an active disc in my system managment and disc managment but i had no access to it. 
but ntsf/fat32 isn't recognised ... a quick format solves the problem temporary. 
but the problem will occur again soon. 
i guess the problem is on a driver-level or bios-level, recognising the disc. 
if you find a solution u can mail me .. christianblock01@yahoo.com.
