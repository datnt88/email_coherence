here's a pretty complete list of the 1366 socket mb that newegg offers there's lots to choose from and here's one i put in the 'possible' pile. 
my biggest concern with the socket 1366 platform is that there are few boards on at places like newegg that get consistent high marks ....i mean 75-80% 5's, some 4 and very few 3's, 2's and 1's. 
instead most are rated 50-60% 5's, 5-20%...4's, a few 3's 2's and too many 1's. 
make sure you pick a good psu to go with that rig... the evga gtx295 says...'minimum of a 680 power supply (minimum recommended power supply with +12 volt current rating of 46 amps.). 
let us know what you decide.
