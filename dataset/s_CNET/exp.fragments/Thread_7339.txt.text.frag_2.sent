&quot;we encountered that if the printer is replace, the new printer works perfectly. 
also, the old printer is then connected somewhere else without any problems. 
has anyone encountered this problem?&quot; yes. 
but we have lj 5mx's or such. 
we knew to check firmware revisions to tell what exactly the models were. 
your view is as deep as &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot;. 
with such a view on the hardware, my best advice is to have hp fix the ones that don't work proper.
