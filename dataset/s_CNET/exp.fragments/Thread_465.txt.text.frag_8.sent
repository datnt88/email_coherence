main machine is win xp/pro sp3 i had built in feb'08: indel core 2 quad 6600, evga nfource 780i mb, 2x2gb pc-6400 ram, nvidia geforce video with 512mb, sli capable, pair of wd raptor x's in raid-1 for sys/programs; pair of wd caviar 500gb in raid-1 for data, cooler master case + ps; floppy; modem, dvd. 
have a ~7 year old hp laptop ... adequate because i require so little of it. 
also an old compaq driven by linux/ubuntu and a mac powerpc g4 with os-x 10.4. 
do web development on the xp/pro machine, use the others to check web compatibility and to play with. 
new machine can be overclocked and the socket will take several cpu upgrades. 
waiting for windows 7 to spring for 64-bit computing. 
as is, am pleased with configurations.
