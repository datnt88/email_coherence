i'm a bit surprised about the negative comments about epson printers as my 10 year old epson stylus photo that i infrequently use works fine. 
i've used both generic and company inks. 
only reason that i didn't keep using generic inks is that i would typically buy them several at a time to spread out the shipping charge. 
by the time i'd get to the second cartridge, it would already be dry. 
turns out that it was no more expensive to by company inks locally with less loss. 
only issue there is that the inks would start to run out while i'm trying to print something important. 
solution there was to remove the cartridge and shake it some to position more of the ink over the end it comes out off. 
that would typically buy me a few print jobs and i could get a replacement in that time.
