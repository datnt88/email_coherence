something new just happened. 
ok as i powered up the pc, i heard no beeps. 
i then looked over at everything, and at a particular corner of my heatsink/fan i smelled a pretty strong burning smell. 
as i stated earlier, the heatsink/fan was getting alot quieter toward the last fews days the pc was alive. 
if i just replace heatsink/fan wil the pc continue to work or has the damage to the processor already been damaged?
