while you mention the mb size of the memory, its important to know what class&type the memory is. 
if they differ too much of amongest the total of the ram installed you have computability problems not to include the system itself. 
in the system, the bios must be at its latest level as it *may* correct or help in this regard. the ras and cas rating of the ram are part of its make-up so if they differ, expect problems. 
one way i look into the make-up of a ram module is to use everest home edition, gotten from some download file service, like or or similar websites. 
once installed and used, find the differences of ram installed and proceed from that. it usually makes sense to have very similar memory installed, besides mb sizes.
