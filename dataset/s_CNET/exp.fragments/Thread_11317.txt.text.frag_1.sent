i put a dvd-player that i don't use any more in an old p2 as well as a dvd-cdrw-combo. 
both of these drives are running fine but i can't get any sound on either drive of any cds or any mp3s. 
i havn't got any music on the hd as i have just set-up new on that one, so i havn't tried if i could play (and hear) it. 
i'm running win 2000 pro on it. the second problem i'm having is, i conected a 56k usb-modem on this pc. plug and play detects the new hardware every time i start up. 
if i try to connect to the net, it says: no modem found. 
i also noticed, that the power-light on the modem is not on. 
i tried to install the drivers of the cd that came with it, no luck. 
when i connect it to my xp-machine then the power-light comes on. 
any recomendations would be gratly apreciated thanks.
