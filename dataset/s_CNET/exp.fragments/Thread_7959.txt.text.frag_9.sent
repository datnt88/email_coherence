as i see it you need to goto the menu under samsung magic bright and select &quot;custom&quot; then set your levels. the others seem to be preset for best operation or so configured. 
if you can't under custom go up and down, then there's a fault as i see it. 
if there some save mode or exit that saves your custom setting, then be sure to do that. 
i don't see any other way around this for now. 
of course, as i stated before no real h/w fault be part of this nagging issue.
