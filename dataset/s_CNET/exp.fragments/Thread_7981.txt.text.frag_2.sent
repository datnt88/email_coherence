three things to take into account: 1. available slots: agb, pci or pci-e. 
wrong type won't fit at all. 
2. power supply. 
if you're unsure, how can we know? 
3. cooling. 
if this is an xp machine, 3 gb ram doesn't make much sense probably (depending on what you do with the machine). 
but it doesn't harm either.
