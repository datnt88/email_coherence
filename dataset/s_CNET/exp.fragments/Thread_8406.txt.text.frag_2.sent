the p-660hw has it's own wifi and router. 
setup could be classified as &quot;experts only&quot; when you add a second router. 
given only model numbers and no details about settings it is time to ask those that set this up to see if the settings are proper. 
i can't tell such from your post except it's not a stock or standard setup. 
again the p-660hw is more than a modem. 
i couldn't find a p-660.
