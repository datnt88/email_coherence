i am not concerned about cpu time so much as the activity of the mechanical drive. 
i've turned off a lot of stuff and still the drive is active. 
almost exactly every second there is at least a small &quot;tick&quot; when the head is seeking. 
this is accompanied by a short flash of the indicator light. 
every 10 to 15 seconds, the activity lasts longer, sometimes up to 1/2 second or more. 
it just doesn't seem that this should be good for the drive! 
am i just being paranoid? 
thanks for the discussions.
