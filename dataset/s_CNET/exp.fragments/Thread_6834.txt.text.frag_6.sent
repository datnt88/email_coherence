i gave a nod to which seems best. 
to go further we would have to find more reviews, build up a &quot;report&quot; and spreadsheets and maybe more. 
as this is all volunteer most members won't do much more than give you a nod or if they own it tell about it and if they were burned by it, they tell you that.
