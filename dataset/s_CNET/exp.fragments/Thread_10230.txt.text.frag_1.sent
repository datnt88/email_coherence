hello, for months a i have had zero success trying to network epson 4800 printers on a windows 2003 server from a mac client (10.5.6). 
i am able to print directly to the printer via ip, but when i send the job to the server nothing happens and i get a communication error. 
epson support would not give me any help ...and stated that epson drivers do not support any server os. so i then created a xp pro box to queue jobs and still had the same problem. 
i need to get these up on a server! 
are there any alternative drivers that are a close match to the epson 4800's? 
generic drivers will queue to the server, however print quality is sketchy..... i just can't seem to face the fact that i'm unable to queue epson printers on a server client network! 
there must be a way! 
i administer a print server with a variety of printers and only epson give me trouble. 
anyone out there run into this issue? 
thanks for reading!
