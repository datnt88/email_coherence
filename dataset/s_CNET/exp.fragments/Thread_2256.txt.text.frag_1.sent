if i were to purchase a wireless router, (those i've seen have several lan ports), could i connect my dsl modem via the wan port and my pc via 1 of these ports to utilise the router as a another security measure? 
also if that is feasible am i putting data rf out? 
do you see what i am asking? 
wireless routers are prevelant, but i would still use the router as a wired pc. rbul1@sbcglobal.net
