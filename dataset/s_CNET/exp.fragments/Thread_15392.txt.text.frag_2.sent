get a router. 
connect the router to the adsl modem. 
connect each pc to the router. 
most routers offer wireless. 
avoid mixing brands. 
my setup is all d-link. 
cable modem, router (wireless for my laptop), three desktops wired, d-link nics in the desktops , d-link wireless card in the laptop. 
with this type of setup the d-link equipment discovers each piece and since they know each other, configuration is painless. 
good luck, telephony facts, analog/digital explained. 
see the cnet faces behind the posts. 
i think computer viruses should count as life. 
i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. 
we've created life in our own image.
