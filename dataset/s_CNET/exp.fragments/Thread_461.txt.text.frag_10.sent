my first ever printer was an epson stylus 800, and i still kick myself for using generic ink because the print quality deteriorated to the point that i had to chuck the printer out. 
perhaps generic inks have improved since then. 
i happily use generic toners in my laser printer because a bad cartridge does not damage the actual printer, but if i ever get another inkjet it will be genuine cartridges all the way.
