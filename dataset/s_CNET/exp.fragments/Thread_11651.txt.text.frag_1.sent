all of a sudden my computer doesn't seem to recognize my lg burner. 
it tells me there isn't one connected to the computer, or it tells me to insert a disk when a disk is already in it. 
i have bought several different types of disks, dvd+r and -r. dvd +rdl and none will work. 
i'm trying to do a pictorial story of our family for christmas. 
i did it on wondershare photo story program but after downloading the 'story' it then told me that the dvd file was probably being used and wouldn't copy it onto the dvd. 
i certainly wasn't using it. 
as far as i can tell it saved the story as a psa file. 
wondershare suggested after many emails to do it on nero or some other burner program. 
but like i said, it keeps telling me to put in a disk when it is there. 
i sure would like some help with this. 
my computer uses windows xp. and a laptop was added about a month ago using a network.
