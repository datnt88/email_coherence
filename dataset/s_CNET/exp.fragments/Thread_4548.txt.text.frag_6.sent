forget the dos boot disk. 
just tap f8 about once a second after you power up. 
select the command prompt. 
after that stops. 
you should have a c: prompt. 
tap printscreen and tell what happens. 
if nothing, then you may have a dead printer, printer port or cable. 
i'll leave you to read your printer manual for the printer self test. 
tell what happens. 
no manual? 
go to epson.com and fetch it.
