i'll stop there. 
next time go get models that have firewire as i bet that would work. 
also, try inserting some usb 2.0 hub into the mix. 
i've seen that correct the odd usb id issue. 
sorry i won't duplicate that discussion again. 
just try it and move to firewire. 
in case you wonder why i don't want to discuss it again, the discussion will not cure it.
