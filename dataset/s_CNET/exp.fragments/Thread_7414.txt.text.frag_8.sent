shows how to run telnet and get that port number but 23 is incorrect and that effort needs a retry. 
as it stands i'm not convinced it's your machine at issue. 
my question is what firmware is in your befrs11. 
which i may have missed your answer. 
can you tell me again? 
-&gt; as to resetting the tcpip stack, that's not a feature of xp. however winsockxpfix does help recover from some malware. 
but given i haven't seen the last 2 items completed, it's a hit or miss whether that would help. 
cheers, bob
