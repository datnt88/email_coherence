yes, i do have the antivirus monitoring off for that drive. 
that helps somewhat. 
but simple things i do keep waking up the hard drive and it is loud. 
for example, i deleted a .txt 
file from my desktop, (that i just created now). 
their was a 10 second delay until the external drive woke up, then the file was deleted into the recycle bin. 
now the drive will be loudly humming for the next 20 min until it sleeps again.
