there are other issues such as use of wep or no security but that's covered in our forum sticky. 
you skipped sharing the details so we can't tackle the problem you want to fix. with my setup you could have a pair of wpa-psk wifi routers on different rf channels, ssid broadcasting (see forum sticky as to why) and it works fine for most. 
again, if you don't try it our way then you should share what you are doing.
