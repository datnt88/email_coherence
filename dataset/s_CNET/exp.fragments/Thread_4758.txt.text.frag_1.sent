so i built my own computer and bought three monitors and i am trying to figure out how to connect the monitors, but need help. 
i bought a radeon hd 8350 graphics card and it comes with two dvi ports, a hdmi port, and a display port the only problem is that i can't figure out how to rig this up to have three monitors side by side. 
does anybody have an idea of what to do and also what products i should buy
