whether you like it or not, i think ms office is part of the business world. 
having ms office on the ipad would be terrific. 
i have two laptops (one small and one large) and i would much rather carry the ipad with me.....it's lighter and simply takes up less space in the briefcase. 
just wish i could have ms office on it!!
