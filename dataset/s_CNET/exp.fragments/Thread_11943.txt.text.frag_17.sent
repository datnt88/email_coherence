i installed the epson network and driver package on both machines. 
it didn't seem to make any difference. 
i then disconnected the internet cable from the router and switched off the firewall on both machines. 
no change. 
i checked again, using the network wizard, everything ok. i used microsoft's network troubleshooter and disovered that the workgroup name (in the computer name tab) was not what i had entered and was displayed in the network wizard. 
after changing it, i was able to see both computers through my nertwork places/&quot;view workgroup computers&quot;, and from each computer was able to see the files with sharing enabled on the other one. 
remembering that my printer is on a usb port on the upstairs computer, i tried to print a document from the downstairs one. the expected windows were displayed, but, on clicking print, the printer window's progress bar filled up very quickly and i found that the file had not been printed. 
i forget the exact sequence of the next one or two steps (having found this whole matter so frustrating, i have had a bit of a rest from it). next time i looked, although both computers were still shown in &quot;view workgroup computers&quot;, i was unable to see anything on the upstairs one from the downstairs. 
i was presented with the message &quot; \home is not accessible. 
you might not have permission to use this network resource. 
contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. 
access denied&quot;. 
well, i am the administrator, and he doesn't know !! i had had quite enough again, thank you, so shut both machines off again. 
this evening, i fired them back up. 
i was able, from the upstairs computer, to modify a file on the downstairs one, and tell the downstairs one to print a jpg file, which it did. 
going downstairs again i was unable to see anything on this (the upstairs one) from it again and was presented with that same message. 
anyone got any ideas?
