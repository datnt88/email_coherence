i did that with my z-680 logitech speakers system there is only so much you can get from them, hooking them up to your tv system. 
there is a lot more you can get from those speakers from a computer with a good sound card. 
it is to ones taste what kind off speakers you chosse. 
before i chose my speakers and my sound card i checked out others and maid my choice. 
i am pleased with the choice i made. 
i am sure that my choice was a good one even though i would have been pleased with the klipsch 7.1 at that time the funds were not there. 
i am still looking to get klipsch 7.1 speakers. 
they are a true suround sound speakers, the more speakers the better sound. 
good luck wendell h
