well assuming you want a color printer, i have an hp6122 here and it works fabulously. 
re: ink prices, i got on the refill bandwagon and that has worked out very well, altho i confess there is a sizable learning curve involved in learning the little techniques of refilling the cartridges. 
(i buy from atlascopy.com) if you do a lot of color printing it's definitely worth doing. 
black cartridges are a lot easier to do-- i have refilled a black cartridge twice now, which has paid for the refill kit 4 times over. 
for simple text i find the inkjets have a certain amout of fuzziness on regular paper, also they are not waterproof, so for that i use hp laserprinters. 
for bulk printing i use an hp iiip, and a 1012 for faster fancier stuff.
