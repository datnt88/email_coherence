um ya i think maybe doom could play on that... :p lol jk but seriously if you want to play any recent games atleast upgrade your ram, get up to like 2.5 gigs or something, your graphics card could prolly play most games, just defenentally not top notch, maybe like lowest settings, and your cpu is pretty slow, maybe if it was atleast like 2.3ghz or 2.4 you would be alright but 1.8 is prolly just too slow.
