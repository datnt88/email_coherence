hello, i'm currently building my first computer. 
i'm following the same parts as the $647 pc recommendation from the magazine maximum pc. the parts are: cpu: amd anthlon ii x4 620 motherboard: gigabyte ga-ma74gm-s2 memory (ram): patriot 4gb ddr2/800 video card: sapphire radeon hd 5770 hard drive: seagate 500gb barracuda 7200.12 cd drive (optical drive): samsung sh-s223c power supply: cooler master rs-460 the recommended case was &quot;rosewill r220&quot; but apparently they aren't in production anymore. 
i don't know much about computer cases so i need some help on finding the right case that's affordable at a decent price and supports those parts. 
also, if there's other recommendations on other parts, please let me know. 
thanks.
