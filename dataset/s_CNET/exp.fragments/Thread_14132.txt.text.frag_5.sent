do you mean that there aren't engineers from the old days still around? 
meaning the ones who designed monitors in the 1980s? 
that's who i'm seeking - because i suspect they'll speak my language in more ways than just &quot;english&quot;. i mean the language of stepping &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;. 
to give an example, i spoke recently to a guy from the company that produced my &quot;ancient&quot; crt. 
he had a chinese or japanese accent, but he spoke & understood english. 
**but** despite his grasp of english, it seemed to baffle him that anyone should be asking a question outside the box. 
he just courteously explained that they don't produce those old models anymore, but that he'd inquire [about whatever i'd inquired] and get back to me. 
as far as both your referrals to doctors, how on earth are they going to help with the practical issue of finding monitors to suit my needs? 
they're not techies! 
and i don't have a problem with eyesight, but rather with overstimulated nervous system. 
i wake up drained, with bone pain, abdominal pain, you name it. 
for all i know, it may be slightly related to photosensitive epilepsy, because gaba somewhat helps my pain, just as it helps with epilepsy. 
but i don't get these problems from the old crt, just the newer ones. 
i'm panicking, since this crt may soon go on the blink, and then what? 
just as snow-blind people need to avoid blinding snow, similarly, i need to avoid problematic monitors, & find a source for monitors that are similar to my old crt or notebooks, *and* affordable. 
after all, i already spent $300 for this high-tech syncmaster - who in their right minds would pay $300 to sit in the electric chair?
