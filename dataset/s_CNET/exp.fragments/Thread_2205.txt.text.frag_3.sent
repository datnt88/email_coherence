there is no &quot;updateable&quot; firmware, teh laptop is usually 8 ft away in the same room(my friend likes to play online games on his couch), but, yes it may be the channel number, because it is on ch6 but they dont have any cordless phones and their kitchen is a rf deadzone( where the microwave is) ill try changing the chan. 
# to 11 thanks.
