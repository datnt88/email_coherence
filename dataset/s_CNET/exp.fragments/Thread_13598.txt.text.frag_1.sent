my pc boots normally under light load for nearly 1 hour if i keep my pc off for nearly 1 day. 
it may run smoothly for more than 1 hour but i never checked it. 
(i can play songs, movie, browse internet simultaneously).if 
i restart the pc, it freezes. 
and if i try to boot it again, it doesnt boot. 
i keep it off for 1 hour. 
after 1 hour it runs for sometime and freezes again. 
mouse and keyboard also stop working. the only way to restart it to press cabinet button for 5 sec so supply to motherboard get cut off. 
so if i want to run it for long time, i need to keep it off at least 1 day and i cant restart it. 
i checked ram. it is working fine. 
my configuration is amd phenom x2 550 black edition. 
asus m2n68-am plus motherboard psu: xtech 450-24,max 450w gpu: nvidia geforce 7025/nforce 630a initial processor temperature is 36c which increases to 48c in 5 mins under zero load. 
i have updated my bios version from 0701 to 0804. 
so what could be the problem??
