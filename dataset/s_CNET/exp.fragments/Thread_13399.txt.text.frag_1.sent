hello! i have a 2ghz celeron, xp, and an audigy sound card... now for some reason, its making a popping sound whenever i try to play a cd or a dvd, yet a mere 3 weeks ago, when i installed the card, it was playing back perfectly fine. 
all other sound is fine, it only 'pops' when i have a cd/dvd in the drive, so i know theres nothing wrong with the speakers. 
i was wondering if any of you nice clever people knew what i have to change/hit hard, to sort my problem out!? greatly appreciated!!!
