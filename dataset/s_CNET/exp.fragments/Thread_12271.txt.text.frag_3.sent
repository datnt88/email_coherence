if you like the canon model that much and while repair costs will decide it for ya, be ready to pitch it. 
in such cases a last gasp is to find a replacement similar model via ebay or craigslist, thus you're able to keep the same setting, etc. plus any supplies you currently have. 
but, if possible an another similar printer is broken(not like your problem), you could swap parts out provided you're capable -or- if not broken use to replace old one entirely. 
stuff happens and far too many pc components break but it makes for a good excuse to buy new an/or upgrade to better end-product. 
you can check canon online parts sales, but these are too costly. 
imho.
