you don't need a 400 or 500 dollar card unless your planning on gaming also. 
for editing photo's you might want to look at the matrox millennium p750 with 64mb ($213.00) or even the millennium g550 with 32mb ($94.00) matrox makes other cards like the parhelia dl256 pci graphics card but there prices are out of most users range. 
before settling on anything check prices on and others.
