i have a trendnet wireless router and my desktop is connected to the router with a cable. 
i had an old laptop with a trendnet pc card and my speeds and connections were great. the problem is with my new laptop. 
i no longer have the old laptop. 
my new laptop has a broadcom internal wireless adapter and the speeds were really slow. 
i took off the security and set a mac filter list. 
my speed is good now, but i keep losing my connection for no reason! 
when i reconnect it works fine for a while, then it's gone again. 
i have changed from channel 7 to 6.
