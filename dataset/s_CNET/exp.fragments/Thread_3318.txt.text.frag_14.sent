what program are you using to connect to the internet? 
intel proset wireless? 
if so, what version? 
if it's version 11, there are problems with it staying connected. 
i had to go back to version 10. download it from here set a system restore point. 
go to control panel and remove intel proset wireless. 
restart your computer. 
install the file that was downloaded. 
now connect and what happens? are you staying connected?
