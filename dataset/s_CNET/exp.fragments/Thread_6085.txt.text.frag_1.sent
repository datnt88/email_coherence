i was under the impression that a video card, graphics card, and video adapter card were all the same thing, but now i think i'm wrong. 
on my pc, whenever i'd run software to detect what video card i had, it would say this - &quot;ati 3d rage pro agp&quot;. 
it's been called a video card or a graphics card by different software i use and when listed under my device manager, it's called an adapter card. 
that's why i thought those were all the same thing. 
however, i recently purchased software that says i don't have a video card. 
i checked the requirements and it said i needed a video card that was directx 9.0 compatible and could handle up to 32-bit color and a resolution of 1024x768. 
as far as i've been able to tell, that 3d rage pro meets all those requirements, but i could be wrong. 
can someone clear this up for me?
