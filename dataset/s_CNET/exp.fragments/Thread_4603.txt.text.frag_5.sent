i fought this for months. 
i even quit using &quot;sleep&quot; for a time! 
everything possible was checked, but it still woke up about 1: am. it finally ended up being the microsoft clock (win 7). 
i changed the &quot;check&quot; time to noon, when i am usually using the system. 
been fine ever since!
