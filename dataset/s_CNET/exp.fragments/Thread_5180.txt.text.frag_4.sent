you don't want to know how many times i've read that then we get the hijackthis log to find out it's still there. 
-&gt; there is another test i use and that's to boot up a live cd call ubuntu. 
no install and i can test the connection. 
as to what you know about norton, sadly they did change how it works so can we skip all this back and forth about it's not that? 
-&gt; and not a word about that cord mentioned in the other discussion? 
why not?
