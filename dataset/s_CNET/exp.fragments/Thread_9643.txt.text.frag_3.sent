thanks bob, i have contacted cannon support and they are unable to confirm if their scanner will definitely work with my samsung wireless printer. 
epson say their print untility feature on their scanners is only compatible with epson printers. 
rather suggests that the technology is there but the software is not! 
thanks glynn
