my sister in law has a 3300c scanner,she has a new hp computer.she is showing the same problem that i'm getting.she has not used the scanner except for when she scanned the same photo that shows the problem.she 
doesn't scan photos becayse her printer is an old hp 500.and it does not print with any quality.
