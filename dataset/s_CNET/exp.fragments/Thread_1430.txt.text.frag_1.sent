i hope someone brighter than me has a solution to this very annoying problem--which appears to be evolving. 
i first got a message from xp as follows: cannot complete the cd writing wizard there was an error in the writing process. the disc you have attempted to write may no longer be usable. 
i followed the standard troubleshooting techniques to no avail. the writer is a ''philips cdd5301 / h1.1'' and is listed in device manager. 
i decreased the speed to match the cd-rw speed, confirmed that burning is ''enabled'', and ran ''services.msc 
/s to ''start and automate'' the imapi cd burner. 
interesting thing here is that it seems to stop at some point after i start it (not, though, when i try burning). 
i may have deleted ''record now'' and therefore installed a newer version (sonic record now) without success. 
i also reinstalled media player 10 just in case. 
finally, i attempted to update the philips driver to a more recent one, but that doesn't seem to work either. 
now, i'm not even getting the error message from the cd writer, but it just seems to lock up when i ask it to ''write these files to cd.'' the message remains the same, ''there is no disc in the drive, please insert a writable cd.'' i tried removing the drive from the device manager and reinstalling without success. 
finally, for fyi, i have not ''reset the drive cables to the optical drive'' nor have i ''cleared the registry filters''. 
i was hoping to find an easy solution that i could simply download and updated driver or something. 
if anyone could please point me to a solution, i would be greatly appreciative. 
otherwise, i guess i'll be forced to purchase and install a new drive, though i have no experience doing so. 
thanks and regards!
