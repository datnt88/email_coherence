i have researched this very subject for 3 months. 
i want a duplex laser however, i found the inkject printer to be superior for this type of printing. 
i have concluded that the hp officejet pro k850dn or k550dtn. 
both have fast and crisp 2-sided printing, both can be used with a network. 
go to shopping.hp.com for further information regarding paper sizes. 
check amazon.com and tigerdirect.com 
for competitive prices.
