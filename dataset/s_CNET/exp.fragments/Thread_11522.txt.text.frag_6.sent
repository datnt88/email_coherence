&quot;they were selected by jumpers not the cable.&quot; 
this is a problem i solve daily (or tech does). 
we resetup the jumpers and let the cable select the drives proper. 
if you can't do this, i must bow out here. 
as to good format software, with windows 2000 i just use the installer to partition and let the installer format. 
any other method is up to the person who decides otherwise to figure out. 
i know that i can't fix that!
