hi, i am looking to buy an external hard drive that i can use to store files from my ibook laptop as well as my desktop pc. i'd like at least 250gb of storage, and it would be great if it were very simple to use, since i'm kind of clueless. 
can you recommend a good brand/model for me? 
i would like to spend no more than $100 if possible. 
thanks!
