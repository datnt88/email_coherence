i'm assuming you're referring to glossy vs. matte displays? 
most netbooks and consumer laptops have glossy displays, which are next to impossible to view outdoors. 
there are a few netbooks that do have matte displays, however. 
namely the samsung nc10 and the hp mini 110. 
i haven't used either of them outdoors, though.
