a couple of possibilites. 
perhaps your motherboard also has a built in video card. 
look and see if there is another 15 pin monitor plug up near where you mouse and key board plug in. 
if so you can go into system, hardware devices, and disable the built-in card. 
of course you will have to plug the monitor into that plug to be able to see to do this. 
you could also try rebooting and starting in the safe mode, f8 and see if it works then. 
of course there is also the possibility the video card is bad.
