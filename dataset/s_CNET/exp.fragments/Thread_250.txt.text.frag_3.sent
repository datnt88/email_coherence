you can buy an external hdd enclosure with usb or firewire interface for abt $30 and put put ur ide hdd in there. 
that way, you will get an external hard drive. 
just google &quot;external harddrive cases' and you will get tons of results. 
if you want to put ide inside ur computer, just use regular ide cable (thin wide flat grey ones, prolly attached to your dvd or cd drive) and use the spare power adaptor to power the ide hdd.
