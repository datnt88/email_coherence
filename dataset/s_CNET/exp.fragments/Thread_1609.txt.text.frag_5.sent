it seems your main thrust is speed, usb simply is more generic to be accepted by more systems than esata. 
if you need(desire) both ports in a ext. 
case, google for such(usb and esata ext. 
case). 
when using custom or adapter type situations expect some problems to crop-up one way or another, maybe not in this case though. 
like i mentioned before do what best suits ya. tada -----willy
