i ended up calling the dell tech. 
line to see if someone could help me there. 
i have had less than stellar tech. 
service from them over the years, but my call today was fantastic. 
i spoke with someone who actually spoke proper english, and he knew what he was doing. 
he walked me through about 4 steps which he said would reset my keyboard in the bios. 
that worked, and i am up and running again. 
i am so glad that i didn't have to spend hours and $$$ trying to solve this issue. 
thanks for the help and suggestions!
