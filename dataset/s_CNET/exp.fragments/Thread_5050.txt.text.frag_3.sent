it is almost that this brand of dvd writer is not compatible with your powerbook g4. not so much the g4 itself as the os. your choice of usb is also not a very good one as bob pointed out. the enclosures instruction manual was correct, you do not need drivers for the enclosure. 
if you put a hd in there, it will work on the mac. 
here's what i would do. 
take the whole thing back to the store and get your money back on both items. 
go on-line to macsales.com and get yourself a pioneer dvd writer. 
that site also sells firewire enclosures. 
firewire on a mac is the connectivity of choice. 
these are the drives that apple uses in their machines are are recognized by the ilife suite and the system (finder) so you will be able to burn directly from itunes, imovie, iphoto and idvd. 
it will also allow you to mount blank cd's or dvd's on the desktop. 
sorry to spoil your project. 
hope this helps a little.
