okay, i have a couple of question about adding a video card into my computer. 
i have the following: brand: compaq presario sr2170nx pentium 4 1 gb of ram radeon xpress 1100 on board memory (128 dedicated and 128 shared) vista os okay, now for the questions: 1. i'm thinking of getting the radeon x1300 256 mb pci-express graphic card. is this a good card for my computer? 
2. will it work with my computer? 
3. should i get the pro version of radeon x1300? 
4. also, it states this: 350-watt power supply or greater recommended (assumes fully loaded system). 
what does fully loaded system mean? 
5. does anyone know if my system has a 350-watt power supply or greater? 
(i don't want to open up my computer right now). 
6. if it doesn't, could i buy any 350-watt power supply for my computer? 
7. can my computer take a higher watt power supply or does it not matter? 
8. is there anything else i need to buy if i want to install the graphic card? 
9. any suggestions?
