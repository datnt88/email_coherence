after more coffee, it occurred to me that only 1/2 or less of the client machines and just one dsl/cable needs work. 
1. select which router has the most users or which one you want to set to dhcp. 
2. disable dhcp in the router that you will not want dhcp. 
3. alter the router that remains a dhcp server to hand out the netmask 255.255.0.0 4. on the lan with no dhcp, change all the clients to static ip addressing using what they got as a template and change the netmask to 255.255.0.0 5. connect the two lans.
