if you are in the repair business there is a minimum counter charge of about 100 bucks. 
so if any product is less than that, then it's ber. 
this was not planned at all but the consumers want products that are cheap and we got there by designing out parts that would add cost to the product. 
as you pass the 100 buck mark in parts you can drop more parts such as screws since it's not going to be opened for repairs. 
the price continues down after that. the cheapest tablets in bulk run 50-60 bucks wholesale by the container load. 
would you be willing to pay more for a serviceable product?
