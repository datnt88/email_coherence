does anyone know what chipsets to look for that allow for a bootable usb drive? 
my understanding is there are usb drives that show up as a removable drive and can also be used as a boot drive. 
just because it's a usb drive doesn't mean it can do both? 
am i correct? 
thanks! 
thought this would fit in this topic as well?
