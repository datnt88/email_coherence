are you using an internal video card? 
if not, you're then likely using some on-board video port whcih is using system ram for its own use. 
doing the math, the missing ram is 64mb(+448mb), the amount loss from 512mb. 
that's good reason your gaming is poor as on-board video isn't as capable as add-on video cards. 
as for ram install, check the specs for what can be installed and way its installed via the support website or manual. 
i wouldn't leave out sp2, its worth the install besides security issues it does alot of 3rd party drivers, etc. your best bet is to do a complete format and re-install of os, doing all updates to include sp2. 
expect a long install process anything else but that may cause sp2 to puke, its a hassle i know. 
good luck -----willy
