it certainly leaning towards a bad power supply. 
the beware factor is, if the p/s is actually bad and you install new devices or componets it may bring them down, not just not work but break them. 
its the cheapest solution for now to replace the p/s unit and then worry about the mtrbd as the next possible cause. the repair shop should have mentioned that, but a flaky p/s is problematic to resolve. 
a 350w unit is a good start but 400w+ units or better and you count on quality, as cheap is cheap. 
on top of all this, you should at least try a &quot;minium system&quot; setup, the basic stuff, just do it. 
don't take anything for granted, all you need is fd, video, 1-ram stick or bank and mouse, kybd. 
no hds, or cds drives active and reflect that at bios if possible. 
if you can't even get a screen then, you have a serious problem, try swapping parts out to replace in the minium system setup. 
if you have any warranty with repair shop return it for such as a new mtrbd. 
should last longer. 
good luck -----willy
