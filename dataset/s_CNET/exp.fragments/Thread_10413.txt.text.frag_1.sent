how do i troubleshoot a linksys router? 
there is no manual available. 
my dsl connection is good for my main computer, but neither of the other computers is getting a signal. 
one is wired, the other is connected by wireless across the parking lot. 
one linksys device is a 10/100 workgroup switch. the green power light in the lower left is steady. 
there are three rows of lights to the right, and five columns in each row, numbered 1-5 left to right. the topmost row is labeled &quot;link/act&quot; and light #5 is a steady green. 
1-4 are dark. the second row says &quot;100&quot;. light #5 is steady green. 
lights 1 and 2 blink steadily, a pulse each three or four seconds. 
3 and 4 are dark. the lowest row says &quot;full/col&quot;. light 5 is a steady amber; the rest are dark. 
is this device operating normally or not? the other linksys device is a 2.4 ghz broadband router with one row of green lights. the power light is steady. 
&quot;wireless-b&quot; is steady. 
numbers 1-4 (surrounded by an oval) show: 1-steady 2-dark 3-steady 4-dark. 
&quot;internet&quot; is steady. 
all cable connections between the units, the dsl modem, and the computer appear to be proper. 
any suggestions?
