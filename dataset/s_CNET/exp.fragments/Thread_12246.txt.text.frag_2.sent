agp is somewhat old, i wouldn't recommend buying a motherboard with an agp slot. 
get the new pci-e x16. 
i for one believe this change was abolutely useless (and sli proves it!). but few cards are released for agp nowadays. 
today, i'd go with nvidia for your north and/or south bridge. 
nforce 4 ultra or sli chipsits are good.
