well, you wonder why the govt. 
model is lower in stock. 
the only difference is that the model# have yet different part#'s to id them. 
i can only assume, that because the govt. is a volume purchaser that is has favored status. 
i would also suppose you have to prove you're a govt' buyer beforehand. 
i may also assume, that a watermark maybe produced during print as a std. 
feature not described.
