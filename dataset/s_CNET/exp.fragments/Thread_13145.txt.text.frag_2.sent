why remember? 
be sure, read the specs either through the manual or support website provided. 
then find out further if your brand ram module is acknowledged as being acceptable. 
not all mtrbd. 
makers provide that but many do just to prove thier product is capable, which if so is the &quot;solid&quot; basis for the specs provided. 
also, a ram map should explain how ram is installed/order of. 
plus review the bios update see where you stand with your current one, but understand what any bios update does if applicable to your problem. 
check the bios for the memory handling, defaults are common, but if configuable, play with it. 
expect some freeze-up if gotten awry, use the cmos clearing pins to return to defaults and reset again for what works best. 
good luck -----willy
