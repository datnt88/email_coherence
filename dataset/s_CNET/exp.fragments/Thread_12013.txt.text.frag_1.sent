my lexmark x7170 printer prints extra black vertical bars when i copy or print anything. 
i first noticed this when i was attempting to print a page from the internet. 
i thought it might have been grayed out areas from the internet site. 
then i copied the page to word and printed. the same bars showed up. 
then i put a document on the scanner and copied. the bars continue to appear. 
i had the black cartridge refiled before this happened. 
could this be the culprit?
