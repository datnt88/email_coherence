we'll still bring our laptops for word, excel & programs. 
do they all open pdf files? 
maybe netflix? 
i have no idea what i will do w/ one. 
i want to use it like a glorified gps. 
look up store locations that my gps doesn't have current. 
i guess just internet, email, and ? 
i just read some articles at best buy but they were too general for novices. 
i'm pretty tech savy but not up w/ all the latest technology. 
never thought i wanted one but now that we have the hotspot everything is wide open. 
i don't even have a cell phone. 
my husband has a cheap net10 prepaid cell phone. 
like i said, i know nothing about this.
