your scanner worked when attached to a parallel ported ptr. 
now you have a usb type ptr.? if so, you can still attach the scanner to the parallel port, if the cable doesn't then get the right cable required. 
it should work or explain that to the computer shop(local) to help get the right one, as this isn't a std. 
parallel ptr. 
cable, it needs to have(probably) 25-pin connectors to attach. 
good luck -----willy
