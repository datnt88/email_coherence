there will always be some bottleneck. 
while a gamer might like that combination a gamer will allows find a game that doesn't load fast enough (hurry up, i want to play!) or write about lag. 
my honest assessment is this is a fine setup for games. 
however there is always a bottleneck no matter what parts you pick.
