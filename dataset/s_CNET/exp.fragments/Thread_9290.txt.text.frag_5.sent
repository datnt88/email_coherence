didn't get round to delting the quarantine in spybot - all of a sudden the computer started to recognise the drives again without me doing anything extra. 
i did try to roll back with system restore but got an error on that as soon as i opened it telling me that it could not protect my computer and to restart. 
it seemed to be after this restart that it all worked again. 
very odd!!!!
