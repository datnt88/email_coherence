it is very poor design attempt on tier part lol. 
i have not been able to figure out why, although i did notice everyone in her area has a bluetooth headset on all the time and none of them understand the settings on their phones so someone probably tried to pair it up with their phone lol. 
if i am actually able to figure something out i will post!
