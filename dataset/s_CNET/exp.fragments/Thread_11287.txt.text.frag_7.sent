as i noted, such adapters are readily available and only serve to confound users and tech support. 
at this point i have not read anything that says this make/model mouse can do rs232. 
your other note about plugging in some serial mouse and it taking over is worth discussing a bit. 
behaviours about this changed over the years since 95 since sending bytes out the serial port to probe for a mouse can confuse non-mouse devices connected to such a port. 
i think this idea vanished over time. 
while you may want things to work a certain way automatically, it doesn't mean that such a way would be acceptable to the next person... so with that, not everyone can be satisfied. 
did you try an usb mouse?
