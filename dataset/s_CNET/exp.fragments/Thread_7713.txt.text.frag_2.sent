if you've got windows xp as os, make it an ntfs disk. 
it's better for xp. personally, i would be quite happy with 1 partition. 
but you could decide to make a second one for the really big files like video. 
they might become less fragmented there (although you won't see any difference in speed), but it will speed up the occasional defrag of your 'normal' partition. 
but that's all. 
how much space to allot for this second partition (if you decide to do so) is dependent on how much really big files you want to put onto the machine during the lifetime of this hard disk. 
if you can't make a reasonable prediction (and you probably can't) don't do it and just have 1 partition.
