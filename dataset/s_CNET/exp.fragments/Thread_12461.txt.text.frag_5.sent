sunlight is a heat source. 
that added heat effects the innards of the crt. 
overall, it shortens the life span of any electronics, to include a crt. 
plus, if sunlight effects the viewing, typically the user will adjust for better display which usually is a higher output and again decrease the overall ideal properties of the crt. 
enuff said, hope this helps... tada -----willy
