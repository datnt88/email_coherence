i have an asus b202. 
i don't think a sound card was ever installed on this device, it's a hand-me-down but it's in great condition. 
when i go to the volume control it tells me that &quot;no active mixers are installed&quot;. 
i've installed the drivers from the asus website but an error pops up during install, &quot;no audio device on hd detected&quot; (or something like that). 
i think my only way of getting sound off this thing without having to send it back to asus might be an external sound card (usb) but i know absolutely nothing about them. 
do they work? 
does it basically replace what should have been installed on the motherboard? 
thanks in advance for help, you guys rule.
