but not one code from a blue screen so i'm going to write it's some overtaxed power supply. 
i see various sites write about 100 watts just for this card and asks for a 500 watt or better psu. 
while i'm inside i'd replace the cpu heatsink compound and ask the machine's maker about bios updates and compatibility.
