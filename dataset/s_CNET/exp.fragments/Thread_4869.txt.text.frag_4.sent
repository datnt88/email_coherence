hello, i am building a new system and i am not sure which route to take in terms of which motherboard, processor etc. here is some info on what i am building a computer for...i am building this computer for music production and not gaming. 
software i use is fl studio and protools as well as plugging in instruments to the computer for recording. 
i need a computer system that won't bogg down when i have all these softwares and plug-ins open. 
i would like to get the core i7 processor, but not sure if i should go for it or not. 
should i go the amd route? 
it seems more affordable to go for the amd route. 
if i go with the amd i am thinking about this then comes to the motherboard. 
i am really not sure which one to decide on. 
here are a few brands i have been looking at are evga, gigabyte and asus. 
what about other brands like intel, foxconn, msi, dfi? 
when it comes to memory should i stick with ddr2 or ddr3? 
i have some wish list categories. 
jeff's computer build = stuff i already have and purchased { } jeff's future build = stuff i am thinking about buying. 
{ } other case considerations = other cases i am thinking about. 
{ } so, i still need motherboard, processor, sound card, memory. 
i am looking to spend $500 more, but no more than $600. 
few notes:for the case, i am leaning towards the azza solano 1000 and for the video card i bought from best buy the visiontek hd 4350 ati radeon video card, should i keep or upgrade it? 
for sound card people have recommended m-audio an emu for music production, what do you guys think? 
thank you very much for your time
