a giant wad of gum that's attached to everything to a point where you can't get it off... lol. 
i ran disk utility and it found a whole lot of stuff on applescript, printers that i have never used, and a few things regarding users. 
there were also a few things with flash plugins that i haven't even used. 
i have started the repair sequence as i type this... and i'm waiting... dang, there's a bunch of stuff. 
but while it's finishing, i can say that everything else seems to be in working order. 
i backed up all of the apps that it originally had, then deleted the unwanted ones or non-functional ones off of the main hd, and reorganized the apps. 
i didn't delete all of the apps since some were apparently purchased and it would be a waste to delete them even if i don't need them. 
appleworks and a few other old things were there, and i'm actually glad about that. 
i could really put those to use. 
okay, everything's been repaired... and it's still crashing... i checked the preferences and preferences pane folders in both the system and library and still no solution... well... i'm out of plans. 
i think that when leopard comes out, i'll just upgrade my laptop, completely erase the imac and put a fresh install on it. 
that may be my only answer. 
thanks for your help guys. 
i wish it could have fixed it.
