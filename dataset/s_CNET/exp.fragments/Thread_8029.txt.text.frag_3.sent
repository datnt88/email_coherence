the quickest test for ram is remove the current ram and replace with new. 
if the new ram works ok, alone then you have mismatched or improper combo. 
if it doesn't work, you have a probable bad or true unrecognized ram which the bios won't allow. 
in some cases, updating the bios should get the most of many ram setups, but not all. 
if the bios is done and the new ram works, then you have your fix, install the other ram. 
as the other poster offered, if the ram is not as required, that too will fail. 
here's what i do in many cases. 
i installed pcwizard 2012, to check the ram status. the ram status will show what your current ram is. 
then you match that against any newly brought ram or compatible types. 
understand faster ram may work, only if the bios allows it and part of its current standing. 
if there too much difference, it should fail as its suppose to. 
-or- return ram and have them explain why it didn't work when their sales people said it would.
