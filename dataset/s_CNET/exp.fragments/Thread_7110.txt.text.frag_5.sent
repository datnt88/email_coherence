thanks to you both for those thoughts and observations. 
so to confirm, i think that you are suggesting that my proposed approach should work and i can stop worrying about crossover cables. 
sunwatcher, terminating the cable runs with rj45 plugs and connecting directly to the hardware is definitely an option to consider. 
i had planned on color coding the keystone connectors to identify the outlets origin but of course i could equally use that approach with the plugs. 
thanks again guys.
