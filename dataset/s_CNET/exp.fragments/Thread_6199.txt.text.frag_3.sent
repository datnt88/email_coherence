bob, on the same subnet, looking via the telcom's router they are both 172.16.x.x. only on a ipconfig do i see a different ip. however maybe i will just redo the ip's and see if that clears them up. 
also remember i can ping both ip's going both ways. 
there is only the 2 machines on the network. 
we both know that sometimes ip's get hung up, so maybe that is it.
