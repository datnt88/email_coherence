good afternoon, i have an amd athlon 3500+ with 2 gb of ram (4 3200 crucial ddr pieces, not super fast ram), 4 hard drives adding up to 1.3 tb an ati all in wonder aiw x300 video card, built in audio, i forget the motherboard, a crummy ecs something or other. 
got the cpu and mb deal at fry's electronics a while back. 1 dvdrw drive - nec. 
i run a 550 watt power supply unit with dual fans, i think it is the antec truepower 2.0 550w. 
i have had it running almost 24-7 for about 10 months. 
works well. 
i would play it safe if you are going to increase the number of hard drives later. 
i increased mine and probably will again. 
plus, you have a power sucker video card with a tv tuner card and the audio card. 
get the enermax 660 watt model eps12v 660w. 
a bit pricy but with the machine you have, it's worth it. 
i have that one on my other machine, it's awesome. 
super cool, air never flows warm out of that thing, even when i used to live in riverside, ca (pretty warm/hot place). 
best of luck. 
let us know how it goes.
