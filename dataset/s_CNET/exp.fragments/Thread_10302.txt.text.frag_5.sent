routers should work out of the box with their default settings. 
although it's highly recommended to switch them immediately to wpa2 for the wireless part. 
in case of such a drop, go to the routers management page, and see if it tells you something interesting. 
if it's still dropping out with the wireless disabled and only one pc or laptop connected wired and it happens with different routers, it's the modem or the connection with the isp.
