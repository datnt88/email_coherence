followed the link. 
picked up a couple of new drivers for chips on the motherboard. 
still have the same situation. 
the drive is there, but windows doesn't see any partitions or recognize the format. 
i'm taking the thing to work with me today. 
if it doesn't work on my pc there, it goes back. 
if it does, then i really don't know what i'll do... i appreciate your patience and attempts to assist. 
having pulled a short stent on a help desk, i understand what it's like trying to diagnose something without having direct access to it. 
there's probably one little bit of key information that i'm failing to tell you, but until we hit on a solution, it won't be apparent what it is. 
thanks again. 
i'll let you know how it goes on my work pc.
