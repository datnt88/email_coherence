i'm running out of space on my comp, and for various reasons am considering getting an external hard drive. 
i've seen several 500gb drives on newegg.com for under $140 or so, but i would like to know what's a good one to get. the main host computer currently only has a usb 1.1 interface, runs windows 2000 sp4, has the 137gb limit, a promise ultra-100 tx2 ide controller (not that it matters for an external drive), a msi k7t266 pro2 mobo, a 1.4ghz athlon cpu, 256mb ram, etc. i don't know what (if any) hardware/software upgrade i will be able to do on this computer, but i am considering trying to get my dad (it's his computer - i don't have my own yet and can't afford it, especially considering the multimedia-intensive things i will be doing with it) to put in another gb or so of ram, and upgrade to windows xp. i would be willing to consider putting in a usb 2.0 and/or firewire and/or sata interface card. 
i basically would like: fast transfer speeds - preferably no more than 10-15% slower than the internal 7200rpm 8mb buffer hds. 
(note referencing above: comp has 1.1 usb interface, i'm willing to get an upgrade card) don't want to spend more than about $100-130 or so (plus no more than $15-30 for an interface upgrade card) i don't know that i need one-touch backup or things like that. 
i will be using this as supplemental storage, not primarily as a backup drive. 
a couple reasons i'm getting an external drive as opposed to an internal one are because there really isn't a whole lot of room left in the tower, and i often will want to take the drive with me and plug it into other computers (some of which may have lesser specs than our computer, btw). 
(also, we're running avg free edition (antivirus), which insists on scanning every single installed hard drive every single day (thankfully it lets you pause/cancel when it comes up, but it slows our computer down by a factor of 10 or more when it's running.)) 
so what are some models i should look at?
