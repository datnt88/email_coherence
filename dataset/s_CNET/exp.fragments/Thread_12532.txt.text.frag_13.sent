bigger is better if you plan to add very many usb or firewire cards or one of the faster video or sound cards. 
they eat a lot of power. 
my custom build w/soyo dragon plus mother board started with a cheap 350 watt supply. 
after adding way more extras than it could handle it went south. 
a 420 watt was the largest one i could get locally on short notice, but if i could have found a 500w or 600w one i would have gone for the biggest one.
