your advice about changing out the ps on a brand new acer desktop pc is well taken. 
the only reason i asked was i had read on this board and other sources that a 300 watt ps was considered these days to be a low rated ps. i was forced to replace the ps in my old win 95 desktop pc last year before hurricane katrina paid my town a visit. 
i took my pc to a local computer repair shop located right on the beach and the owner was able to fix it. the owner installed some private label ps which was rated at 450 watts and my computer is almost 9 years old and yet manufacturers are installing only 300 watt ps's now in brand new desktop pc's? 
unfortunately hurricane katrina blew away that guy's computer store; he decided to move on rather than stay and rebuild. 
i just thought a 300 watt ps was kind of wimpy when i read about gamers having ps's rated from 500 watts and more in their gaming machines. 
let me ask you this; if someone asked you which brand of desktop pc would you consider to have more bang for the buck, which of these two brands would you recommend? 
would you recommend buying from acer or buying from dell? 
i'd be using the computer for word processing; email; web surfing and some quicken; that's all. 
i'm from an older generation apparently because when i asked a guy at acer recently if any of their desktop pc's came pre-configured with a floppy drive; he said no and then asked why i wanted a floppy drive when there are other ways to back up computer data? 
the guy at acer said something about a flash drive. 
what's a flash drive?
