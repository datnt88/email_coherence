i have this r3000 laptop that can go from 70 to 40 watts just by the throttle. 
now i do have to cheat by using speedswitchxp to kick the cpu to high gear instead of dynamic switching. 
and i can carve another 10 watts by dimming the screen. 
that's better than 50% difference from full throttle to full power save mode and it's still usable.
