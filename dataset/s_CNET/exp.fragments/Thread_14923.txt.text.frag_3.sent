as far as im aware i think the firmware is 1.21 (i've read that theres a 2.1 or .01 but unsure if i should use it or even how to install it) ssid no idea by what that is, looking at the status on the wireless (while on limited connectivity) is default if that is of any help. 
as for stock settings, again not sure by what you mean. 
sorry for being breif but i'm not very good with this stuff.
