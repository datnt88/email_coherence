hello everyone: my first post on this forum. 
in the nov. 
issue of pc mag on pages 106 & 107 there is an ad for a new hardware device called &quot;iphantom&quot; offered by phantom technologies, { it supposedly protects your network and pc against viruses, adware, spyware, network intrusion and identity theft while allowing you to surf anonymously over an encrypted link by providing a hardware firewall between your broadband modem and your router or pc. has anybody purchased one of these devices or seen any evaluation wriiten or broadcast anywhere? 
if this device functions as they claim it could easily solve alot of our internet security concerns. 
i have no connection with this company, i'm just tired of fighting malware and intrusion attempts on my pc's, friends pc's, family pc's etc. is this the answer?
