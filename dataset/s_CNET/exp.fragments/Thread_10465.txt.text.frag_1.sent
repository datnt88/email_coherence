good day to all i have a printer (canon ip 5300) and the printer overall works fine. 
but as soon as i try to print on a disc, using the cd tray, i can't seem to print in black. 
i started from scratch, and made a monochrome picture, which is either black or white, and when i print the picture using cd label print supplied by canon, it prints cyan(blue) instead of black. 
i tried selecting &quot;print in grayscale&quot; but it still comes out blue. 
i contacted canon about this, and i'm still waiting for an answer. 
i updated all the drivers and software, and i tried installing the printer on a mac os x desktop, and from that i'm still getting only blue. 
when i print on an a4 page, then it can print black, but simply not on the discs. 
can anyone assist me by telling me if there is something i'm missing, or if this printer is capable of printing black on discs. 
thanks in advance
