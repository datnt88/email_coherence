two updates: 1. i had another restart the other day despite the bios update and bios fan setting change. 
but, i didn't actually witness it, so not sure if it was the same problem or something else (it happened over night). 
2. there have been a number of comments submitted to my blog post on this topic. 
on recent comment is a little different from everything else i've seen so far on this. 
here is a cross-post of the comment (from ): matt says: december 12th, 2007 at 11:16 am &quot;i had this happen recently to me (6 months after buying) and i think ive come up with one reason why it does it. 
(card jaming flaw!) and psu flaw. 
1st move the tv tuner card down a slot. 
where they put it at the factory is far to close and does not allow the heat to escape causing a progressive temp spike. 
on top of that (after doing a voltage test) when the fan goes into its screaming spin up, the power spikes over the psu max. 
(even at low speed test showed 403w take from a 400 watt.) i called gateway and got a replacement 8500gt card and replaced the psu myself. 
havent had 1 reboot problem since. 
hope this helps.&quot;
