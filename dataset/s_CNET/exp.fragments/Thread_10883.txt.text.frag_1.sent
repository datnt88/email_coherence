i am a graphic designer and need a new computer. 
i currently have a g4 power pc with version 10.3.9 installed and i tried to upgrade it again because i cannot afford a new computer. 
doing some research i found out that i cannot upgrade to leopard or use the new cs3 programs as they are not compatible to 10.3.9 . 
i create graphics for print ,web and 3d .what 
does someone recommend since price is the issue . 
i was looking at the apple power mac g5 - ppc g5 1.6 ghz ,apple power mac g5 (1.8ghz, 256mb ram, 80gb hdd),apple power mac g5 - ppc g5 2 ghz,apple mac pro dual-core xeon 5150 2.66 ghz.
