i checked that, there's no usb devices/external devices connected, so that's not an issue...supposedly, (this isn't my computer it's my fiancee's brother's computer) it was fine the night before, but now it's not. 
gonna try disconnecting the dvd-rom and will post the results if that fixes it. 
thanks, pedo
