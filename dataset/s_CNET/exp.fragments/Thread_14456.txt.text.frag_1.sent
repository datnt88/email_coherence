i need to figure out how to connect a computer to two different networks at the same time. 
both of the networks will be wired and must be on 24/7. the computer has (or will have) two wired network interface cards. 
one is an onboard card and the other is a pci card. the operating system is xp professional. 
i am &quot;somewhat&quot; familiar with networking. 
thanks
