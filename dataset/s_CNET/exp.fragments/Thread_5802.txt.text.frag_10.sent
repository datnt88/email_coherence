i would wait, and get a pci express motherboard. 
you will not be making a bad choice. 
newer games are coming out, and then you may want to get (microsoft vista). 
by waiting you will not regret it, that is what i intend on doing. 
but what you are doing now is good asking questions, i did that for over a year before i built my first. 
good luck wendell h
