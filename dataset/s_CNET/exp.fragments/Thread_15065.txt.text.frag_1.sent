i'm about buying a new monitor and i've to choose between 22 and 24 inches. 
what would be better for gaming/movies, and why? 
can i enjoy full hd on 22&quot; as good as on 24&quot;? 
also, i'd like to hear your opinion about this one: note: i'm from poland, so don't need opinions on the price (it's very small ;)), but on the technical site. 
i'll be grateful for your help!
