so the deal is that i recently bought a nas device for our office network, which is a simple windows configuration (not running windows server 2003, no domains or anything). 
as such, nobody logs into the network. 
each workstation is simply assigned to a windows network group. 
i have the nas (a western digital mybook world edition ii 1tb) connected via ethernet to our cisco catalyst 2950 router and mapped it on all the workstations without any problems. 
everything is almost perfectly. 
each of the workstations are connected on the network via the cisco router and each workstation is operating on windows xp for what it is worth. the drive, by the way, comes with a shared storage manager tool that allows me to create cif shares and assign rights (non, read only, or full) to network users. 
the problem i'm having is that the shared rights aren't working properly. 
i set the minimum permissions to a share as read only, for example, and everyone can read from that share just fine. 
if i assign full rights (read and write) to specific users for a particular share, they are still unable to write (only can read). 
so that is my stumbling block. 
among the 20 users, i want only three people to be able to write to a particular share and the read to be read only. 
any thoughts on where to begin diagnosing my problem and solve it? 
can i eliminate the use of western digital's shared storage manager and control rights levels to the shares via windows networking and, if so, how i would do that? 
thanks.
