this is probably a function of your old version of toast. 
you really should be moving away from anything &quot;classic&quot;. the os x version of toast will burn just about anything, including pc compatible disks, dvd, d/l dvd, cd and all the other neat stuff. 
toast 6 titanium os x version, is the earliest version you should be looking for but toast 7 would be nice. 
happy burning p
