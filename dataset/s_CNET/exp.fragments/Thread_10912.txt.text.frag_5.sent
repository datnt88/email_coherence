don't fret. 
your laptop *might* have some settings in its bios for overclocking. 
if so, those desktop core 2 duos do quite well with overclocking, at least in desktops in a laptop, you'll want to be very careful - use one of those laptop cooling pads with the fans in it, increase the front-side bus speed very gradually, and only have it overclocked when you've got the machine plugged into the mains. 
and do whatever you can to keep the air going into the laptop cool as well, i.e. no direct sunlight, and air-con.
