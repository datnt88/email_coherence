pertains to your stock (?) psu. 
most off-the-shelf systems don't have sufficient power to expand the system with lots of extra components especially power hungry components like a high-end gaming card. 
in addition, being most hd 6870 gpus have their own power connectors that must be connected for it to function properly. 
if you've already taken care of the psu...maybe the card is just defective. 
keep us posted.
