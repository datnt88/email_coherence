the three tests i took, nvidia, ms, and pcpitstop all told me my laptop was capable of running vista. 
that wasn't the problem. the problem is none of them told me which version of vista i could use (except ms - see below). the part i'm angling for is support for aero. 
in my original post that portion was given to me by nvidia's own vista readiness test. 
i think i had to install some plug in. 
with nvidia being a graphics company they for sure took a hard look at my graphics chip. 
if i interpreted their results correctly it meant to me vista ok but just use vista basic. 
ms upgrade advisor however i think told me i was good for vista home premium. 
so i'm getting conflicting information. 
i could of course go to the store and try it out but what if aero doesn't work. 
i'm stuck with a copy of os i can't give back. 
finally looking at link a previous responder listed for me it states in there the wddm model is supported with updated drivers but for a certain vista build only. 
though pixel shader is supported i don't know if this is enough. 
pretty confused here. 
help!
