since you appear to already be paying for internet service, the obvious, easiest, and most reliable way would be to buy your own wireless router or add a wap to your existing system. 
are you wanting to drop your isp and tap into someone else service? 
if so, that may be illegal but is also very unreliable. 
i know that some communities have installed wifi that's available to subscribers at a cost that may be more attractive than some isps offer. 
you could check into that possibility if you wish. 
i don't know much about how these work but suspect they may offer less than air tight security.
