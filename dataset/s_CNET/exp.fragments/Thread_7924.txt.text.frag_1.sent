i am going to be building/buying a usb external hard drive. 
i have read reviews online that were full of horror stories of such drives failing after 2 weeks on intermittent use, and other equally disturbing problems. 
my question is what brands of usb hdds or usb hdd enclosures are the most reliable? 
i dont really care if i build it myself or buy it pre-made; i just want the thing to be as reliable as possible. 
thank you for any help you can provide.
