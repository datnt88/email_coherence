hi. good choice with the core i7 cpu. 
i also did some research on the wd black 1tb, vs seagate baracuda 1.5tb. 
in the specs that matter, such as data transfer, the baracuda wins. 
i installed one in my blackbird and i`m happy with it. 
also; i use dual 9800gts` in sli mode. the graphics in crysis are great. 
even on my 32&quot; monitor. 
however, after reading about ati`s radeon saphire series, i`m really thinking of going for these bad boys. 
but for the price, its hard to beat dual 9800gts.
