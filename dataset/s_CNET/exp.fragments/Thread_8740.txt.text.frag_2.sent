if you have the cd for ms office, you could try an un-install and re-install of office but that sound a bit drastic so... a few checks... 1) go to (the pc-cillin people- so it's a trusted site) and run their free virus scan (housecall) - it checks for everything, not just viruses - it will even tell you if there is a windows update you haven't done. 
this will also check for spyware, greyware, malware etc. etc. this is always first port of call for unusual problems - bugs can cause all sorts of strange things. 
2) do a scandisk (chkdsk) or whatever xp uses for it's re-boot disk check. 
3) are you fully up-to-date with windows update and.... office update...? if not, run both... there may be a glitch that they now have a patch for. 
4) try using a different font... instead of times new roman which is usually the ms-word default font. 
if this prints ok, you may have a bad times new roman font so remove it and re-install it with a good copy (ask a friend for a copy if you can't get at one on a cd). 
or does xp have a font repair program, i can't remember. 
5) i'm guessing that lexmark have already told you to download their new z52 drivers for xp...? there are 2 driver here and you will probably need both. 
... hope this helps or at least eliminates a few lines of enquiry. 
please let us all know how you get on.
