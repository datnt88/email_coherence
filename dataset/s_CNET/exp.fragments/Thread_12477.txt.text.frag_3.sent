after disassembly, i reassembled and rechecked the second mobo. 
when it still failed, i then, rechecked the first mobo with same items and it still works... thanks, for your help. 
i will get it returned... i'd still like to know why it failed... do you know? 
or is it more testing required? 
(i am not a techie. 
i just follow instructions well.) thanks for your help...
