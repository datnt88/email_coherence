- device manager is under a button in the hardware tab of the (right-click) properties of my computer (on your desktop). 
- the bios setup is under the f2 or f10 or the delete-key (or a rich choice of other keys, totally depends on the maker of your pc or motherboard) right at the start of the booting. 
look for a message like &quot;press del to enter setup&quot; or study the manual. 
if the drives are listed in my computer (windows explorer) and you still can't burn using a burning program, there are 2 possibilities: 1. a problem with the driver. 
you can see that in device manager (which is the way to manage your devices). 
2. a broken burner. 
needs to be replaced. 
any computer shop can fix this.
