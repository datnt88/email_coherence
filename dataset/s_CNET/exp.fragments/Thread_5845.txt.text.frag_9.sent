i have a similar problem with hdd... it goes &quot;tick, tick, tick&quot; on booting, but does not boot. 
i had to replace the hdd (80 gb western digital, only 14 months old) and reload win xp pro... experts tell me all data is lost, no way to revive the original hdd. 
i am wondering if you found a solution to your problem... ????
