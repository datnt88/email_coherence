i have a dell 1700fp and a ibm 9519-ag1 that have the same problem. 
they were both being used on a dell optiplex gx110. 
since they are both doing the same thing i was wondering if they are stuck in energysaving/hiebernation mode or something like that? 
we pushing the on/off button on either one nothing happens. 
they just continue to blink. 
no screen. 
doesn't even flicker. 
can only turn them off if i unplug them from the wall.
