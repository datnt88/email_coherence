ok so im a trainee in a it dept, and i was tasked to configure a wap(wap-6011 level one). the wap needs to be configured to extend a network from a wifi router so that coverage is available for all corners in the office. 
having little knowledge in networking, this task was meant to provide some exposure on configure network devices. 
however i cant seem to get the wap going. 
i'd tried almost every single operation mode that is given with universal repeater seems to be the most plausible option to go for, in which i can get connected to the wap from other devices but no access to internet. 
any guides/pointers would be much appriciated. 
(do excuse my posting should it contain any errors because its my first time posting).
