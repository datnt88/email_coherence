ok i have cleaned out the computer and it still shuts off. 
i thinks because of heat. 
i guess my next step is to replace the psu. 
do i replace it with the same unit number. 
this is a six year old h p pavillion. is the psu plugged into the mother board in more than one place. 
if so how do you keep track of where it plugs in.
