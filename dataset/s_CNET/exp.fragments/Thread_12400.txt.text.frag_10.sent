but try this setup outside the case. 
i've found too many machines that someone built with an extra mounting post on the motherboard. 
there can be other issues like a shorted reset button to a low cmos battery but the clues here are sparse. 
build it on the out side of the case on a cardboard box to see if it's ok there.
