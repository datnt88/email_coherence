i, too, prefer the standalone flatbed scanner, mine is a canon 8400f a few years old, so probably no longer available. 
it comes with a separate backlight in the lid for slide, film and negative scanning, as well as the usual flatbed print scanning. 
the software (canon toolbox) is very good, both for a quick &quot;standard scan&quot; and also advanced mode to allow access to the scan driver directly. 
resolution is outstanding, so much so, that scanning some old family black and whites from the 1930s and 1940s, the resolution of the scanner was better than the grain on the prints, so i had to turn it down a bit! 
downside is that it is big and bulky and when paired with a colour inkjet and mono laser printers, the combo does need a desktop to itself! 
best bet is take two or three samples along to your local pc dealer, typical (whatever that might mean) of the pictures you want to digitize and try out the models you are interested in. 
try printing the scanned images too, don't just rely on the screen rendering, where a dpi of as low as 72 will look good!
