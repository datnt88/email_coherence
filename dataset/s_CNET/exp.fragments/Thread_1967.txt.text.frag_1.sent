hello everyone i am new to this field.. so i am asking a rather simple qestion but seriously i couldn't find the answer anywhere. 
for a device to communicate with another device it sends the information with specific radio frequency. 
now my question is why do organizations like fcc, etc allocate the bandwidth in the first place through auctioning and stuff like that. 
i mean there is no limit on the em spectrum to be used right. 
can you please tell me the exact specifics of why actually allocation is needed and what happens if it is not allocated. 
i also want to know why specific frequency is allocated to specific radio channel. 
why cant a radio channel use any other frequency. 
i am kind of new so this may seem absurd but please help even any links or books explaining these concepts are also fine for me and sorry if i posted in the wrong area cuz this is wer i found appropriate.
