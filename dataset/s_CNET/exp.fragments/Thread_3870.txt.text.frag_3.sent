hi. i have worked with d-link, netgear, huwai, linksys, senoa wireless routers and access points. 
just a couple of each, therefore not many. 
however, i checked and found the wireless range of the old &quot;linksys wrt-54g&quot; (the one which came with two antennas),router to be double than others, including linksys' own newer model wap-4400n. 
the only exception was senoas outdoor router. 
its range was immense, to say the least. 
but its output power was also more than others. 
just a point. 
navneet.
