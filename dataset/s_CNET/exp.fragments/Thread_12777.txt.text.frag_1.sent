my computer is a dumbbutt. 
it stopped working in multiple ways, eventually decided to gut it and replace certain parts. 
i ran into a problem, i realized i didn't know what kind of cpu i have. 
i opened it up, and also realized i didn't know how to know. 
basically, visually, what cpu do i have? 
pics attached. 
ill be so thankful... [url= [/img][/url] [url= [/img][/url]
