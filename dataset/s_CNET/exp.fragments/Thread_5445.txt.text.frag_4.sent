it's the same as theirs. 
they &quot;knew&quot; it wasn't that. 
and found it ran with one stick so it couldn't be &quot;that.&quot; 
shop counters thrive on such issues. 
let's not let them have the easy ones. 
or at least be sure about that. 
again, the details in your post are not there for me to look into the other area of bios, memory timings and more. 
but you can research that on your own.
