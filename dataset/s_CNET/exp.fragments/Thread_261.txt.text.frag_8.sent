if the screen is going blank and the computer has to be restarted to get a picture back , then it could mean that either the monitor's driver or the card's driver has bugs in it and needs to be updated to a newer version. 
if the video card was bad then there would be no picture at all, even after the computer is restarted. 
and there would be a post beep during startup to indicate that the video card is failing (usually 1 long beep and 2 short beeps). 
or it might be that the monitor itself is not properly connected to the video card at the back of the computer. 
that could also cause the screen to go blank.
