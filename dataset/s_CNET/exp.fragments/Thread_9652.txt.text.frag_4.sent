thanks for your helpful thoughts. 
i think i know what you're referring to with cs operation--so instead of jumping one disk like you do when you have master and slave disk, i jump both. 
will they load or run any differently when i do? 
also, if this doesn't work, is there any use in trying the external usb method that robert posted about? 
or they both trying the same thing in different ways? 
finally, does anyone know if newer desktops will still support a 3.5&quot; floppy disk bay? 
up until a year ago, my husband still had to use these to back up data when he was at school, so he has some data on them i need to transfer to cds. 
i was considering taking out the floppy drive bay from my old computer and putting into the new one to back up his old stuff. 
thanks! 
joy
