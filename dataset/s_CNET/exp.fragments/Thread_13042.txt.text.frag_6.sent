why not get some pcs from craigslist for free/dirt cheap and just rip them apart and upgrade them? 
good will sells all of their pcs for $15. i have see a few p3s there and i still use a p3 as my workstation. 
(it has 2x15gb ide drives raided together for a swap file, 512mb ram, 1x 40gb drive for storage, 1x20gb drive for os and a dvd burner.) it isn't a speed demon but with a dedicated video card (free) it runs xp nicely.
