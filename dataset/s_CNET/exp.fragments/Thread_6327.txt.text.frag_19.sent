i had all my usb ports fail tried everything (including usb card) short of reformatting, motherboard manufacture said the the board must be faulty, bought new motherboard, still no usb,eventually discovered on kaspersky forum that kaspersky internet security was to blame,just needed to uninstall and reinstall it, all fine now, except time and expense.
