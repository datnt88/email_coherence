i am unable to share my pc with my smart tv. i have checked &quot;share files/drives&quot; on my pc to no avail. 
1. my tv sees the computer in the network, however when i go to open it, i only get access to c/users/pictures/video, (the demo ones) that came with the pc. 2. i also do not have my audio and video, pics in the &quot;my documents&quot; part of my c drive. 
3. they are all on my d drive and i think there in lies the problem? 
how can i access my other drives so they will be accessible on my tv? thanks for any info!
