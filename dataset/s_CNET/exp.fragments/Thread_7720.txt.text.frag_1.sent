i went through setup and internet works with any connect computer through direct connection. 
also, my iphone and htc aria both connect to the router wirelessly but i cannot get my laptop or my parents computer to connect wirelessly. 
i have tried allowing them through the router and it does not work. the network is secured with a password and i am correctly typing the password in. 
i do not understand how my phones can connect but not my laptop or computer? 
i have updated the firmware on the router and everything works on it perfectly. 
any help would be nice. 
p.s, this router is hooked up directly to a att uverse modem.
