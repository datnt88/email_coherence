there is a computer at my job with building automation software on it, uses an sql database. 
the software recommends a 512 graphics card. the computer has a monitor but we don't use it that way. 
we all connect to it via remote desktop. 
does the that computer benefit having a graphics card? 
or do only the computers remoting in need a graphics card?
