because the audio is playing from the computer output ports, there is no hdcp issue. 
and this is not just for br/bd. 
second, my monitors have dvi inputs, not hdmi. 
vegas movie studio hd platinum 10 renders stuff in real time in preview mode. 
i do not know, however, if this is gpu or cpu intensive. 
so, &quot;the usual ati 5450&quot; may be just fine. 
but i'm not sure. 
which is why i'm asking all you experts.
