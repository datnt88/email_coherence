it's a multiplayer online game, doesn't have ability to buy/download online. 
it's copy protected. 
tried all the things you suggested, short of replacing the drive. 
tried autorun and manual with the setup.exe, it won't even recognize the disk. 
guess it's just one of those things. 
seemed wierd that both the drives on one computer would not read it, but could install on my laptop. 
they may be the same brand?, but different models. 
one is faster double layer dvd/cd burner, the other just a player. 
thanks for replies.
