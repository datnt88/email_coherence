choopy performance in games is sometimes attributed to network speed/ping/bandwidth issues if you have a cable modem for instance, i have seen where i have gone from 20 mbit download 1mbit upload to half that- for reasons only the internet service provider can explain, inotice sometimes the ping seems ok- but when i run speakeasy.net/speedtest 
what i originally got is half, the only way i resoplved issue was to unplug the cable modem and wait a minute and replug in, this in turn gave me a new ip my thought was they crimped my speed during a busy time. 
this in gaming first person shooters looks and appears laggy and screen jumps, it may look like a graphics issue but in fact your bandwidth may be crimped that the packets coming in are to slow for u[pdating your game and thus jerky. 
just a thought. 
in addition, i used a radeon/saaphire version 1950xt at one time was great- but issues then only in 3d gaming wiered graphics during gaming- but analyzzing the heat temperature with the catylist showed whenever i reach 64 deg c it would crap out- so i just replaced video card, you could use this analogy by looking at temp- doing other apps other than gaming monitoring temps, then in 3d gaming look at temps, but i would guess this is a bandwidth/net speed / ping issue
