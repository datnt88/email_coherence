i am not sure if i did in the first place. 
the thing is, all the machines in the warehouse have these keyboards and this is the first one to have problems. the driver software was installed properly on all of them. 
what do i need to do to 'pair' these together? 
keep in mind, i will be testing this on another pc that has xp professional instead.
