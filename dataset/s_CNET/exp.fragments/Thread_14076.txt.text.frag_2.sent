i think that leaving the pc &quot;asleep&quot; or in the stand by mode is the same as shutting it off. 
it would be better to leave in the &quot;always active&quot; mode so that the hard drive wont have to wake up and recover each time you move your mouse. 
that will strain it and shorten its life as well.
