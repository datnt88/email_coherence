if you are talking about files then i would be very happy if you can state precisely which files u are talking about. is it images, documents, spreadsheet data, music?? i must say that u can all do that just by asking that some one to install google drive n then u can share all the above mentioned files with him. 
if you are very specific about files such as spreadsheet data o music then, ample number of tools are available which target a specific need. 
just as collatebox can be tremendous for online data sharing.
