hey, i appreciate your help thus far. 
i have purchased what you suggested, and i am left with one last inquiry. 
the power supply that i have is a retail plus 465 watt with a dual fan. 
i just want to make sure this will be fine to power my new hardware. 
the guy at the store mentioned that i would need something at least 500 watts. 
just wanted to know your thought. 
thanks
