when a company has no more imagination than to name every product with a lower case &quot;i&quot; they don't deserve to have even their own product called by that name. 
i certainly would call an ipad model tablet &quot;my tablet&quot; when talking to a friend. 
if i had an apple product, i would be ashamed for my friends to know that i had paid a ridiculous premium price to such an un-imaginative company for an ipad, much less use that improperly capitalized word to describe a working product. 
ipad will never be a generic word in my life.
