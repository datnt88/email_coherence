they go into a standby mode and the pc still detects a monitor is attached to the port. 
i recommend you boot the pc, delete both monitors in device manager, then shutdown. 
disconnect the projector cable and move the monitor to the dvi port. 
now boot up and then shutdown. 
now add the projector and reboot. the monitor should be your primary display while booting and the primary display in windows.
