device manager say they are enabled and working? 
have you checked all the ports. the two on the front most likely are a separate root hub than the two on the back. 
doesn't sound like software unless you added something else creating a conflict (irq). 
worst case scenario, get an inexpensive pci card with a couple ports and has a connector for the front of your case. 
less than $12 and disable the motherboard usb.
