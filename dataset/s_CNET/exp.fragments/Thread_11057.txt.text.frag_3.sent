thanks for the reply willy. 
i was able to test my psu with my brother's very old pc (its the only component still compatible with his set up) and it started up fine. 
while i am not entirely sure this was the most effective test (his pc is going on 5 years old), it proves my psu isn't completely dead. 
should i just rma my mobo and see what comes back?
