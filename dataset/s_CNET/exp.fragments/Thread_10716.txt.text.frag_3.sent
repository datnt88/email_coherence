i just asked my mother if she used the software she asked me what software. 
so she never used it. 
i just went to help her because the keyboard was not working but the mouse was. 
i assumed she used it because the mouse was working and it is not a brand new computer, so i knew she needed it, but apprently she didn't. 
she told me she just did what the instructions told her to do and indeed she did because i just saw it. 
no mention of the software, even though there is a disc.. it just states turn the computer off, plug the mouse in and turn it on. 
interesting so you are saying this is nothing new if i used the software. 
because they never even asked me if it was used..
