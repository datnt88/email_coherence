it sounds like you have a relatively nice setup already, but as far as routers go, there are routers that are designed for gaming as well, d-link makes one of them and linksys another, and they are supposed to improve online gameplay by reducing lag time. 
most computers should be able to handle wow without too much trouble with anotehr program running in the background as long as you have good quality memory and a good quality graphics/sound card. the bottleneck may either be your service (cable slows down with increased traffic in the area) or your router.
