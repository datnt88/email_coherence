i see you have a mismosh of home+student and added outlook. 
while it could be one of the usual issues such as protection software stepping in, your combo of software is just off center. the fact this vista is at sp1 doesn't help matters either.

let's see if office sp3 requires vista sp2? 
sorry, but the article about that is missing. 
why not step up to sp2 which does list vista sp1? 
bob ps. read the post above about free space.
