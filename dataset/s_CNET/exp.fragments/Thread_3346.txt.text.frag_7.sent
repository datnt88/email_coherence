i see you found how to control the firewall so that's a good step in the right direction. 
i offer zero support for zone alarm as you can tell. 
that's for zonelabs to do, so i leave that to them. 
it's sad to see people struggle so with this product. 
as to it's all you do need to know, except for the firewall issue. 
which i noted. 
what more can i offer people?
