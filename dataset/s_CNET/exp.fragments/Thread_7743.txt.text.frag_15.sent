quote from steve jobs. 
i think this idea falls under that. 
apple would cannibalize sales of the 10 inch ipad, and i don't think they will do that. 
they are also not interested in competing with kindles and the other small tablets. 
remember apple never produced a netbook. 
as a product line, they were too cheap. 
as for me, i already have an ipad, so no, i won't be interested. 
i won't be buying another tablet until somebody comes out with a real tablet computer worth buying. 
i mean something serious, not hobbled and tied to itunes, a real tablet computer the size and weight of a ipad. 
tell me about that.
