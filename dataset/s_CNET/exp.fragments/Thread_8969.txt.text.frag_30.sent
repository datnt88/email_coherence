be very careful when trying to set up a dual, or in my case, triple, boot. 
i had win98 and winxp home coexisting just great for a couple of years. 
then, when trying to put suse 10.1 on another partition, i answered the install question wrong and overwrote the boot info. 
after trying many options it was just better to wipe and re-install. 
booting with multiple os can seem simple at first, but it is not and there is no product i could find that would do an easy rescue, and i tried a bunch. 
other than that, i have not had much bad luck in the wipe/reinstall arena.
