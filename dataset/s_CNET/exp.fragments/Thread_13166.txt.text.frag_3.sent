intervideo dvd is the problem. 
it stops the tv decoder from working. 
remove it from add/remove software. 
than download an update intervideo dvd software from hp and install it. 
as soon as i did this the tv worked again. the answer came from an online hp tech. 
i didn't see what one had to do with the other, but that conflict was the problem.
