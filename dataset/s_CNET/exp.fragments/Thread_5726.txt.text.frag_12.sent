i have a nvidia geforce 6150se nforce 430 with an amd athlon(tm) ii x2 240 processor, 2800 mhz. 
i am running on a windows 7 home premium with 4 gigabytes of ram or memory(always get something there mixed up).i am roughly 16 and play many videogames that require a strong graphics card. 
i mostly play command and conquer games like red alert 3 or c&c 3. both games require a graphics card such as a nvidia geforce 6800 or better. 
now i was hoping that someone somewhere could help me find one that isnt too expensive. 
i am going to get a job because my father refuses to get me one. 
so any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
