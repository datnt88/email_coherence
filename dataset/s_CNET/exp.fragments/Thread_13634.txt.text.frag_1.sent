i have a sony playstation 2 and want to hook it up to my home wireless network. 
the only problem is that you can only plug cat5 cable to the network adapter of the ps2 and i don't know of any wireless recivers that you can hook up via cat5. 
i have only seen usb ones, and ones that you put directly in your computer. 
can anybody tell me how to get my ps2 hooked up to my wireless network? 
thank you! -will
