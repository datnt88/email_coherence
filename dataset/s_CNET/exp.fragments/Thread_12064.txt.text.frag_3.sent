bob, thanks for the quick reply. the download states that i will get driver version 5.1254.1120.2006. 
when i check in device manager, i still get 3.0.18.201. the driver dir of the update did not seem to have an inf file for the wg111v2, just a .sys 
file. the inf file is net111v2. 
also, when i try to run the installed &quot;netgear wg111v2 smart wizard&quot; i get the hourglass for 1/2 second. 
btw - did you got to penn st?
