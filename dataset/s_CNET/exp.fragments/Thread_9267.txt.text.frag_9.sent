that when you want to open the tower, you have to disconnect it with the little button on the back, take the electric cord away and touch the metal cover to loose the static electricity. 
that's correct no?but i can imagine there is some fright left in the box itself (like an old television). 
i didn't open the tower yet (lack of time: working from 8 till 18). the last time i openend the tower was when i installed the memup internal dvd-writer (witch by the the way, after 1,5 year,now refuses to burn dvd-r or +r but burns cd's -r,-rw,+r,+rw and dvd-rw and +rw without any problems!!?) i promise i will do it tomorrow, maybe i'll find a mouse or something..hihihi o, by the way, my beautifull blue light that lightend the front of the tower, went out....i can take a look at that too. 
thanks you all. 
i will let you all know how it went.
