apple has a long history of abandoning users when apple decides that their technology is obsolete. 
on the one hand, one can be philosophical and acknowledge that this is part of doing business with apple -- you must be ready to spend big bucks to upgrade your hardware when apple commands you to do so. it is likely that, sooner rather than later, the mac os will be specific to intel hardware and you will be left in the cold. 
knowing that history, if i were on a fixed income i believe i would soldier on with the old machine until the situation settles down.
