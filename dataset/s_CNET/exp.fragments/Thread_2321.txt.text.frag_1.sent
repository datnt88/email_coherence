hi all new here so here goes have a siemens amilo computer and the trouble is i cannot connect to a certain wireless network. 
the router can take upto 4 laptops and this one will be the third so itis not a question of to many. 
all the other laptops can conect to the router when the pass key is put in but this computer will not. 
this computer will connect to other networks but not the one at home. 
when i put the pass key that it asks into the computer it says that it is not the right one. 
what am i doing wrong or is there something missing from the computer. 
not very experienced at this so be patient and spell it out in laymen terms thx
