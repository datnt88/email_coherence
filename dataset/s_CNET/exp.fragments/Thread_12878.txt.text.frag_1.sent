hello. 
currently i have a network with internet access on 4 computers via a router. 
recently i aquired a twisted network cable, and am now in the process of making a network between a fifth computer with one of the computers in the normal network. 
i have managed to find the other computers on this fifth one, but i have no internet access on it. the fifth computer is connected to its host with a manual ip config on both computers, this makes it find the network, but can i somehow then make this computer find the internet via its host somehow? 
i also want the computers on the normal network to find this fifth computer, but not even the host finds it. 
both computers use windows xp home and have the same network card: ia pci 10/100mb fast ethernet adapter. 
also, the fifth computer is newly reformated, so it might possibly be missing any program/update. 
thankful for any help.
