i still don't see their test working unless the attacking machine is an ap that the attacked machine hooks up to. 
they have not demonstrated how they can &quot;sniff out&quot; a signal from another laptop and just hack into it. 
i really am bummed that they used a 3rd party card with a mac. 
actually, i am very suspect because they never told us the card's brand name. 
it's as if they tried to keep it as annocuous as possible so they wouldn't get sued and have to prove it all or something. 
with that said, i can't disagree with you that eventually, just about anything seems to be compromised eventually. 
people can be pretty creative in figuring out ways to hack stuff. the more technology there is, sometimes, it seems like the more holes develop. 
for now, though, i think wpa is pretty safe. 
especially for the average home user. 
i never saw any mention of a firewall in use during that video, or a good live virus scanner. 
have to watch that one again.
