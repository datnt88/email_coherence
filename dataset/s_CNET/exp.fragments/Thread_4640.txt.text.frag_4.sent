&quot;ow is it that you come to the conclusion that my os is damaged? 
my computer and internet connection was working just fine before&quot; the answers are in your posts. it doesn't matter that it worked before, these pests such as xp antivirus 2008 and more are wrecking havoc to the point i'm now finding it faster to copy the owner's files out then restore the machine with the restore cd or if this is the windows media center pc 2005 a1477c hp pavillion with a ms-7184 (sb450/ati chipset), they offer the f10 restore on bootup which can do this without the cds. 
this os is taking too much damage today to do much else than a restore. 
here's why -&gt; these retail hp and other machines do not ship with the microsoft windows xp cd so all the repair methods you read about do not apply. 
hp has their way and not much else. 
good luck!
