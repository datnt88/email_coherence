the x800xl is avliable with either 256mb of 512mb of gddr3 and it's onboard bandwidth is over 30gb/s (that's bandwidth between the gpu and vram) the interface between the card and the system is used to recieve data to process and to offload data when vram is full (which is why all high end cards have 256mb+ of vram, to handle a) the high res images that their gpu's are dealing with (1600x1200 in 3d takes up a lot of space) and b) to help prevent offloading to the system ram) even with pcie x16 using system ram is amazingly slow when your going from ddr in a 32 or 64-bit interface (64-bit is dual channel ddr) clocked at say 400mhz that's 6.4gb/s of bandwidth that's dual channel pc 3200 while the card is using a 256-bit interface clocked 1100mhz (that's a 6800 ultra's ram, and it's 8 channels wide in total) here is a more technical look at the x800xl for those interested: and here is an nv40 for comparison: and here is g70:
