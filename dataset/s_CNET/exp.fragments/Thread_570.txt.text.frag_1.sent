recently i have noticed that my mouse is jumpy. 
when i move to a location or move very slowly the mouse seems to jump a bit further or move up or down. the whole system is only about 6 months old. 
i have cleaned the mouse and tried to remove the mouse pad. 
i have tinkered with the settings in the properties without sucess. 
it is just a standard wheel mouse from ms. any ideas?????
