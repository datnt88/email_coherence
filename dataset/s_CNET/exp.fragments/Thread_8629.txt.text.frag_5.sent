every week i have someone at the office show up with a corrupted fat32 volume. 
it's too prone to damage. 
just do this. 
copy a file to it and then yank the usb cord. 
our ntfs volumes survive and i can kill the fat32 volumes on demand. 
yes we can format them and start over but where's the fun in that?
