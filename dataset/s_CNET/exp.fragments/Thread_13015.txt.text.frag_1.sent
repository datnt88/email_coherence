will ram with different timings work together? 
i currently have 2gb of ddr2 800 corsair cm2x1024-6400c4 g which has lower timings then the stuff of that model im finding on newegg and i want to add some more ram. 
will it work together still? 
also would it be worth going to ddr3 1333 or just stick with the ddr2 800 i have? is there even a notice difference?
