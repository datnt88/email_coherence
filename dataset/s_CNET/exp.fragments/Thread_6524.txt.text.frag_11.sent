try corsair. 
they will have dominators for your needs. 
that said, thats a lot of ram. 
unless your machine has specific need for this much ram. 
in a bunch of tests i`ve read, some pcs had a small increase in performance with 6gb ram. 
at 8gb there was no increase. 
the biggest concern here is the power consumption from 8gb of ram think about it.
