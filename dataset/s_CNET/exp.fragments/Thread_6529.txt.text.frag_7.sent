thank you for the information on the power supply! 
im a little timid to spend the money replacing it, to find out thats not the problem, you know? 
fifty dollars is a lot to a teen with no job (yet). 
your right about hooking up the hd to this computer. 
i thought of that, so i figured. 
i was just testing to see if my hd was still working, to see if that was the problem. 
thank you for the info too on hooking up a slave drive. 
no problem with the os, its the same on both computers. 
thanks again for your reply and information! 
i really appreciate the help.
