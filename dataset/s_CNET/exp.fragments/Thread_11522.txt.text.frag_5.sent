thanks, i had 1 checked the jumpers on the hard drives. 
they were selected by jumpers not the cable. 
my advice came off a website either bootdisk.com 
or another boot site i found on google. 
they recommended the hd be clean for 2k pro and xp. i had already run me while setting up and checking all my settings. 
everything worked fine on windows me. 
i had decided to use 2000 pro for the os since i had a computer hit by lightening. 
i was not sure i wanted all the problems with xp. the operating system came off a cd that was supplied with the burnt system. 
it was probably an oem disk. 
could use some sound info on good format software.
