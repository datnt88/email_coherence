not too many hard drives/optical drives?

i assume you'll be using 1280x1024 or below as a standard resolution, right? 
i would say an 8600gts would be the absolute maximum. 
i'm a wee bit afraid it actually might be too much. 
the 8600gt is slower, yet draws less power. 
actually, scratch that. the 8600gts requires external power, which i'm not sure that psu includes. 
of course, you could get adapters and such, but i'd feel safer with the 8600gt. 
&quot;it [8600gts] is designed to draw about 71 watts of power during operation. the geforce 8600 gt is significantly slower, but also uses significantly less power. 
it is designed to consume 43 watts and ...&quot; check out this review: between both the cards. 
~ibrahim~ p.s. i'm not very up to date on the hd2xxx series by ati, maybe someone can shed some light on those?
