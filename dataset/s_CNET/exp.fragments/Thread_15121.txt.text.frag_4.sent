didn't play on mixed mode. the printer only showed up in 802.11g mode at the router. 
truly a mossberg 930 target. 
the software was no better. 
so even after getting it to work, hp's support was not there so back to usb connections for quite a long time. the printer is now history and i went to another make for awhile.
