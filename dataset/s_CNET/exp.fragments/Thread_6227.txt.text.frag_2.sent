like d-link. 
i had heard good hings about them but i went with linksys wrt54gs. 
fry's price was $89.99; you may be able to do better on the web. 
i found a nib customer return they had marked down to $56.99. 
i had occasional dropped connections but after a few calls to linksys the problem was resolevd. 
they have decent support.
