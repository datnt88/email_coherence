most any new system today would probably work out for what you are looking to do - the biggest factor may be price. 
if you are looking for a system with good performance you should be able to find multiple choices for around $500-600 that would come with the complete system, a 19&quot; flat panel monitor, and a basic printer. 
i would start with the major oems such as dell, hp/compaq, or sony and see what you can configure as your best price. 
don't hesitate to call them and see if they can improve the deal as well - they often have unadvertised specials and incentives that can get you a great system at a great price. 
if you are looking for something specific or a certain brand and would like some more help or have other questions post back and i'll see what i can do.
