don't take anything for granted and recheck all setting and cabling. 
next try moving the monitor or system to a different location and outlet. 
if it settles down then, you have &quot;rf outside interference&quot; of some sort. 
last, its possible some damage may have been done during the move and its starting to fail. 
if under warranty, use it don't mention the move.
