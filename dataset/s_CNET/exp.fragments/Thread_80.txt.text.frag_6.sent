it's like we watch you struggle at the end of a rope. 
someday it will dawn on you that such a &quot;adapter&quot; or &quot;rewiring&quot; doesn't work. 
how can i shorten the time it takes you to realize that laptop lcd's are not vga displays in disguise? 
you don't want to know the truth so you may struggle trying to do this for weeks and months. 
here's hoping you will realize that this may never work. 
if it did, you'd find articles aplenty on the web.
