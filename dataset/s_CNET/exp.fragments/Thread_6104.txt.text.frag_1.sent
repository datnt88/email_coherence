got a memup xdrivelll portable harddrive/card reader with 40gb capacity. 
when connected to computer and after deleting all contents 'properties' tab on computer shows indeed 39,8gb free space for the drive. 
however, display on portable drive itself only shows 21,5 gb free space. 
what is blocking the rest and how can i get the whole drive clear?
