thus you got the nt [no text], went back and added text but failed to remove the nt. so then it looks as if your message has a subject line only. the subject line is so vague that many won't bother. 
possibly make the post again without the nt, and then send a mod alert from this post of yours and ask them to remove it. 
they can then also remove my reply. 
most times the mods will comply.
