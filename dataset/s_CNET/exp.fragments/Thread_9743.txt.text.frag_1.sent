hello everyone, so i'm looking into buying a powerline adapter and have narrowed down my decision to two possibilities: the tp-link tl-pa4010 av500 or the trendnet tpl-406e2k av500. the thing i'm really concerned about is any disconnection problems - if the connection happens to drop for some reason, i would hope that it would be able to reconnect itself rather than having to manually plug it back in. 
i know the tpl-406e2k has a high editor's review on here, but the tl-pa4010 has more reviews on amazon with a higher percentage of favorable reviews. 
it's hard to find any other sources of reviews on the latter though. 
any guidance about either would be greatly appreciated.
