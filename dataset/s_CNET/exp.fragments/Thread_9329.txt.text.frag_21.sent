i think you are confused. 
last we chatted you were nice and actually tried to help me. 
i was shocked. 
my gateway did die and i was wondering how to get the info off the hard drive. 
i think at that time i had decided on a mbp and was sending the lenovo thinkpad back. 
but we have not had good luck n the past so if you want to actually help me like your last post appeared to be doing, great.
