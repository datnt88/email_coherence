i am wondering if, because the radeon card has both analog and digital outputs, this might be a factor. 
also, does your monitor have both analog and digital inputs? 
if the above are true, i would try some cable swapping and/or input selection from the monitor itself to see if you can get a screen from an alternate boot device.
