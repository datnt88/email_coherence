just be aware that &quot;bad caps&quot; are also in the psu, something not readily seen until taken apart. 
on top of that a bad cap can be one that's &quot;dried out&quot; literally void of the electrolytic fluid it needs and/or has degraded.

system. 
i agree, a post card is useless unless you have the means to repair and access to parts. 
for me that would be looking at junk mtrbds., 
etc., and it doesn't pay when a new mtrbd. 
easily returns the pc back to life. 
as for the fd, if you like checkout a usb based one(if applicable) because here you can re-use it elsewhere. 
just a thought.
