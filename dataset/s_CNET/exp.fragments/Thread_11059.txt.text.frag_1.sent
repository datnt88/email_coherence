here's my setup. 
i have one computer with a linksys wireless g pci adapter in it. 
i have it wirelessly connected to my 2wire modem in another room. 
in the same room as my pc, i have another pc that i would like to get the internet connection shared onto. 
now, i have a netgear wireless router with 4 ethernet ports on it, the wgr614 v6 router. 
i was thinking i could simply plug both computers into this router, and set up a shared internet connection that way, but everytime i plug in this router it seems to disrupt my wireless internet connection, however then the two pcs are networked fine. 
only no internet! 
can anything be done about this short of buying a wired-only router?
