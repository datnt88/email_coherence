thanks for all the hints so far. 
this win98 systems has a hardware firewall (router) certified by using shields up, running norton internet security (2003) updated daily on boot-up. 
ad-aware and spybot s&d run at least weekly and i've tried that several times since this started. 
to clarify, this problem most effects boot-up speed and then any access to the internet. 
i can run half-life and never see a stutter. 
on boot-up, i was used to hearing the moboard health check beep and then the hd would fire up and continue loading. 
now, the hd light will come on hard until my screen background comes up and then the drive led goes off, only to come on once ever few seconds. 
this goes on for maybe 3 - 4 minutes and then finally the led will go hard on and the machine finishes loading. 
programs, except for ie, appear to work fine at this point. 
when loading a page, the ie globe will move only every few seconds and then not very much. 
something is interrupting program execution. 
i suppose i could turn all networking function off and see what happens. 
after this started, i went back in and turned off file & printer sharing. 
checking the task list doesn't turn up anything unexpected. 
watching the network i don't see anything moving in or out unless it's something i commanded. 
this may be a hardware (hd) problem but i suspect i've done something that's causing congestion or confusion for the os - just wish i had some idea how to track it down and fix. 
thanks again for trying to point me in the right direction.
