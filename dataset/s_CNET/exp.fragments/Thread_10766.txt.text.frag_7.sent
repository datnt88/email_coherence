hi duckhunter, i can't tell you which external hard drive to buy, but i have a different caution. 
if you are buying a usb 2 drive, make sure your computer has usb 2 ports. 
if it doesn't you can add a pci card with usb ports for a modest price, but then you have the issue of whether your os can see a usb 2 device. 
if it can, the third caustion applies only if you like to make images of partitions or drives from dos. 
some imaging programs (acronis true image, norton ghost) can see a usb 2 drive while operating in dos, but some others can't. 
good luck, dan s
