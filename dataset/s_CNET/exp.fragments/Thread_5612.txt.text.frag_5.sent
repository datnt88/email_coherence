running 2000. 
will the bootdisk fdisk/mbr command work without deleting the data on the other partitions? 
i was thinking of trying to repair the disk (quick fix?) by inserting the windows cd. and seeing if it would repair the partition. 
i have reformatted many harddrives before(with the boot disks), and i know that you can repair them as well(instead of the full install), and in doing that you just rewrite the windows files. 
i know the easiest way is just to reinstall a fresh copy, but i would like to get it back instead of this option.. virtual lab, get data back, and data recovery insurance program - were used. 
they came up with minimal results..
