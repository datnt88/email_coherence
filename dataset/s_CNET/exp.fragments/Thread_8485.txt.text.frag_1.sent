hey guys i am just wondering on how to close ports on a linksys router? 
i have closed a few like 21, 23, 25, 79, 139, 110, 143 & 443 by forwarding them to dummy ip addresses. 
i done a port test at although all the main ports are closed or stealthed it gave me a list of potential ports that are non-stealthed. the list was .. 123, 146, 623, 901, 902, 903, 1243, 1560, 2001, 2002, 2800, 3000, 3700, 5151, 6776, 7000, 7410, 9696, 10100, 10528, 11051, 12345, 12346, 12348, 12349, 15094, 17569, 20034, 25685, 25686, 27374, 31337, 34763, 35000. is there anyway i can fix this as i cannot forward all them lol. 
also if anyone has a good port listening program they can suggest i would appreciate it.
