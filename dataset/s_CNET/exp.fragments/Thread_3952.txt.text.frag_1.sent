am trying to network my two home computers, and am not very capable with setting this up. 
my specifics are as follows: comp.1--hp desktop running windows xp home w/sp2. 
this has norton systemworks 2007 premier and zonealarm pro installed. 
comp.2--gateway running windows xp media center. 
this is fresh out-of-box, with no installed av or purchased firewall yet. 
motorola cable/telephony modem sbv5220 linksys router wrt54g version 6 linksys wireless-g wmp54g wireless-g card was installed on gateway and appears to be ok...brought up a list of available networks it sniffed out. 
attempted to install router on hp with supplied cd, but cannot connect to internet thru router. 
wiring is correct: cable to modem, ethernet cable to router, line 1 ethernet cable to computer (hp). 
have been in touch with their &quot;support&quot; techs. the last one informed me that there was a compatibility problem with ie7 (running on hp). 
so i installed firefox version 2.0. 
same problem exists. 
i'm able to &quot;ping&quot; their site 192.168.1.1, and can also &quot;ping&quot; a url (if there's any difference between those two). 
i don't know how to check for the ip addresses, nor where the mac address comes into play, if at all. 
any help would be appreciated.
