i am using a dell deminsion 8100-pentium 4--60gb ultra ata hard drive. 
recently the hard drive is clicking loudly, occassionly, first 1x-then 2-3x, while the drive is clicking the os freezes up, nothing works, then after a 'whizz noise' it continues back to working. 
i've used every system check, scan-disk, defrag, and the only info it shows in &quot;complete-defrag&quot; that there 'may' be physical damage to my hard-drive. 
but then it may work for days and the error will not show up, then the next time i turn it on, there it is again. 
i took the front case off to be sure it is the hard drive 'clicking', it is for sure. 
should i go ahead and replace the hard-drive or wait for it to shut-down completely, second, i have an external 120 gig hard drive-how can i do a complete drive c backup to this external drive for the install of the new hard drive?
