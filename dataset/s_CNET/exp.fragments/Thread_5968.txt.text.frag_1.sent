i've got an external hard drive currently connected by usb to our &quot;main&quot; computer downstairs. 
what do i need to buy to connect it to our router instead? 
i obviously need an ethernet cable to go from the router, but i am unsure as to how to connect the ethernet cable to the hard drive. 
is there a different cable or adapter i can buy? 
or would it just be easier to buy a new external hard drive that comes with an ethernet cable/adapter? 
thanks.
