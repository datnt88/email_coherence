so while i can offer ideas, no one is there to fix it for us. 
having said that... be sure to use traceroute on the host (xp) machine to see if there is a 10.10.10.x or 10.x.x.x in the route. 
this could cause your nat (ics) to fail. 
fix? 
use that other 168.x.x.x private ip range for ics. 
also, many are firewalling beyond reason and while you are setting up you must have a firm grasp on the firewall. 
for my testing i often turn it off and if it's a third party firewall i often find they break ics so i uninstall it.
