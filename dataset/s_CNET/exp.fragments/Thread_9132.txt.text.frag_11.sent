maximum pc and cpu are good magazines, as well as websites, to visit to learn more about hardware performance. 
if you already have a box, then you'll have to make sure the motherboard fits in it correctly or it won't do you any good right off the bat. 
also, you can go online with to the makers of the motherboards, and find out which processors will fit the socket. 
not all of them will plug right into just any board. the computer i am using right now is made up of parts that i collected and pieced together. 
i haven't been to college since 1992. 
i have built a total of 6 machines, 3 really old ones, and 3 relatively old ones. 
with what i learned, however, i was able to get them up and running even with windows xp, after a so called &quot;knowledable person&quot; said it wouldn't run anything past windows '98. 
so it isn't really rocket science, but it helps when you do a little research first. 
after what i learned, i am going back to college to finish the degree in computer information systems, without having been in a classroom since 1992. 
everyone thinks it's great.
