windows 98se recognizes my kensington serial trackball as a generic serial mouse, and it works ok when i first plug it in. the problem occurs later, when i reboot, and no mouse is recognized at all. 
there does not appear to be anything wrong with the connector. 
should i get an adaptor and try it on the ps/2 port. is it any better than the serial port, or is there no difference at all? 
although i have another usb mouse that works fine,i like the kensington because the size of the trackball makes it easy to move around. 
any suggestions?
