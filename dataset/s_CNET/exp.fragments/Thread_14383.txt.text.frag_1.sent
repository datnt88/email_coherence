okay so i own a hp compaq nx9030 laptop. 
i use to mave around alot with the laptop and now my usb ports do not work. 
i could be wrong but i dont think it has anything to do with the operating system, because everytime im connected to the internet and i move the laptop it disconnects. the usb ports actually move...so i was wondering if someone could please help me, i'm not ver familiar with these types a things. 
thank you in advance.
