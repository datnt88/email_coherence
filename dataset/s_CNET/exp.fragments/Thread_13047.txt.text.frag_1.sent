i have a 'husband' built system... i'm running vista ultimate, sp1, on a amd athlon 64 x2 dual core processor 4600+ 2.4 ghz. 
i have 2 gb of memory, 32-bit os. i have 2 hd's (250 gb each), and for christmas, my husband picked me up a 1.5 tb wd hard drive. 
he hooked it up (in the case) and then told me how to add it, going into computer management, formating it, etc. the problem? 
it's been stuck at 73% for hours... i started the formating last night, around 10pm.... it's almost 9pm here, and it's still formatting. 
i've shut down everything, and it's still formating. 
i did the full format, (not the simple), per his instructions. 
anyone have any suggestions?
