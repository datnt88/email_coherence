first of all, the noise you are hearing is either the fan or the hard drive, or something vibrating inside the case. is it a steady, consistent noise, a vibration, or a grinding, scratchy noise? 
if the computer is located in a warm room or doesn't have adequate ventilation, the fan will run a lot. 
giving us a better description of the noise will help is sort that one out. 
now, some questions: what will you be using the computer for? 
(mostly web browsing, word processing, games etc) what model is the presario (the numbers)? 
pages loading slower - is it only web pages that are slower or are other programs slower too?
