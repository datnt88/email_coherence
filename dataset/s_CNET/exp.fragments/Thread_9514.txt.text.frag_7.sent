hello, i'm scott and i am having a problem with my ram space as well, so if anyone could help or give some tips i'd be very grateful, heres my problem: after downloading some programs over a period of time, when in the start-up menu i may have left the box ticked which means alot of the programs will try and start-up all at once when my computer is switched on. 
this is what is causing my pc to take a while to turn on i believe, so searched for a program which might help and i downloaded: freeram xp pro 1.50 this is in the toolbar showing me what my ram is at that moment in time, i try to free ram using this but it does its best but does not seem to free alot of space and after a while that seems to drop down low again. 
after reading those replies i noticed steven said: &quot;doubling the minimum ram is not a bad idea. 
next, identify what programs/services are loading at startup. 
determine which ones are necessary and disable the rest i can't provide specifics here.&quot; 
i think this may help to my problem with the programs but i have no idea of how to get to where i see what programs are set to load up on start-upso if steven or anybody could direct me to this list i may be able to disable some programs which i don't need at start-up. 
(btw my pc is a packard bell, the system is microsoft windows xp media center edition and its has a 512mb ram ) thank you scott
