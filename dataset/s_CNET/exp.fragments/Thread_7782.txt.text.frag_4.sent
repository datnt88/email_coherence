did the win98 drive ever work to boot to win98? 
to boot into win98 you would have had to install it on the drive when it was the boot drive. 
you can always sys the drive again, using a floppy, and get a bootable partition working, at that point you need to definitely have win98 correctly installed with the c: drive listed as the boot in the msdos.sys 
file. 
see if there is a msdos.sys on the win98 drive and what does it show as the windir?
