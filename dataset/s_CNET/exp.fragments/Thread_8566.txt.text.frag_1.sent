here's a question, i have a very fancy surge protector here . 
. . 
and my motherboard recently died right after a big electrical storm. 
my question is, since these surge protectors guarantee to protect you, how do you prove it didn't?? and get reinbmursed for the fried mobo? 
--fj ps just an aside, now i can't connect to my cable modem thru the surge protector, i have to go direct to the computer. 
not sure if it's the cable or the box tho .
