if you've got the &quot;black only&quot; option selected, the printer shouldn't be using any color ink except when you run a cleaning cycle on it. 
if you don't have it selected, it will always use a mix of colors to create black. 
technically it's not &quot;true black&quot;, but it looks like it, at least on the printers i've owned. 
incidentally, when you run a cleaning cycle, it uses ink (or so my epsons have always told me). where does it go?
