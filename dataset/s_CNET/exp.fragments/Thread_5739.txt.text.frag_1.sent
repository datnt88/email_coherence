i need help on my first pc build, i need to know a motherboard/mainboard that can support overclocking and all the parts below. 
gpu- or a ram- chassis- psu- cpu- hdd- ssd- any input would be greatly appreciated. 
also am i missing anything besides the motherboard/mainboard? 
for example, does the cpu cooler come with the cpu? 
are all the cables included in the items? 
are all the parts compatible? 
since i am completely new to this i don't know what to look for, so your advice could really help me.
