thanks for the response. 
i do try to eject the drive before i remove it. 
however, there are times that i get a response that the &quot;drive is still in use&quot; although the file has been closed. 
i've found the only way to get around this is if, while in the same program, i open a file from my hard drive and i guess that frees up the memory?
