hey everyone. 
first off, i know some tech stuff, but not much. 
please forgive me if im wrong about anything. 
well, my computer just died. 
i had a friend check it, he said the power supply was shot (only certain things getting power). 
when i turn the computer on only the floppy drive turns on and nothing else. 
its an hp pavilion 743c and almost 4 years old. 
i think a storm/lightning strike nearby caused this problem. 
do you think its worth it to try to fix the computer? 
or should i just wait and get a new one? 
if i dont fix it i was hoping to be able to put the hard drive on this computer (this is my parents computer). 
as a second hard drive. 
can i do this? 
what would it be like? 
could i make it like it was two different computers (like logging on to our seperate hard drives)? 
i have attached the hard drive to this computer (replacing the hard drives) and it acted like it was going to boot up, but on the screen it said something about something missing. 
i know i need to configure it somehow. 
but i want to do it as a second drive. 
can anyone explain how to do this or point me in the right direction on instructions and information? 
i just didnt know where to start looking. 
sorry thats so long and jumbled up. 
thank you for your time!
