hi screen remains off, sleep light comes on. 
little to no noise, no clicking hard drive or anything. 
then fans starts in about 4 minutes - its like its never awoken from sleep! the only thing i can think to do is take hard drive out - see if that works and recover data.i 
am nw wondering may be its a logic board failure? 
they seem pricey enough to replace and not sure if worth it on 6 year old mac?
