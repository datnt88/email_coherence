just got a 1gb corsair flash drive from new egg for $24.99 which included free 3 day shipping. 
i ordered it tuesday and already have it. 
there were many good reviews for this particular flash drive so i thought i would mention it. 
it comes with a lanyard, cd for win98 (should anyone have that), and an extension. 
seemed like a good deal.
