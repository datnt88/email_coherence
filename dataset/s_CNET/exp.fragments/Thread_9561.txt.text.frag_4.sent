could you please clarify precisely what you meant by &quot;temporary copy&quot;? 
i had assumed that an internal storage drive was quite dependable. 
i will attempt to obtain a backup drive for this storage drive in the future.. is this what you were referring to? 
i am now having second thoughts about this pirchase, if not reliable. 
also, what software is required? 
dependent on drive capacity? is it practical to have one backup service two separate internal drives? 
partitioning required?
