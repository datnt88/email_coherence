some modems have the standard ethernet connection and a usb connection. 
some allow both to be used at the same time, some don't. 
you'll just have to investigate the modems available to you. 
if a modem will allow both connections, connect his using the usb port, and then connect a router using the ethernet port for the other pcs. 
i think i'd have a heart to heart with my brother.
