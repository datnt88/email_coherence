&quot;i ran &quot;memtest&quot; on my computer and it almost immediately gives me an errors stating that my ram isnt storing data values correctly and is not storing data etc.&quot; fix that first! in many of these multiple video card systems i find installing just one video card can clear this up. the poor soul usually asks me why. 
my answer is unpopular when i reply &quot;ask the person who designed this computer.&quot;
