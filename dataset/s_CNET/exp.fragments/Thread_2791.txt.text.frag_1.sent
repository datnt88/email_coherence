i have lost something in xp that recognizes my wireless adapter. 
i do not have a xp disc just the upgrade from me. is there anyway to download something or figure out what i need to fix this? 
i am running sp2 and have reloaded it, but aparently what i need is not in the service patch. 
linksys wireless adapter and a dell latitude computer.
