i am most likely going to receive the rest of my computer parts this coming monday. 
so that i do not waste any time later, can someone please tell me how to replace the stock fan on an evga 7800gt? 
this is a picture of it: do i take the entire black thing off? 
or do i just take the black frame off, take out the fan, and put it back on? 
i am planning on using the following fan: thank you.
