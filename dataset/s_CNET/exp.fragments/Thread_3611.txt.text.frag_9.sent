managing multiple routers is different then turning of wifi. 
they are two different posts. 
i got that fixed over a day ago. 
i turned the wifi off on my t-mobile router and now i can't configure it. 
i do not want to have 2 wireless going. 
i have my d-link working just fine just can't see the linksys.
