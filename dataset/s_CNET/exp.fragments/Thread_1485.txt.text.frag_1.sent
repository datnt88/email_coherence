i just purchased a laptop with vista installed and am having a rather difficult time getting it added to my network. 
lack of sleep due to overtime may possibly be a contributing factor here. 
i'll not post my system specs just yet, as i don't think the specs have anything to do with the problem. the network is set up like this: dsl modem--&gt;router--&gt;hub--&gt;pc2 i--&gt;pc1 i--&gt;laptop if you can follow my diagram. 
this has always worked fine to have three pcs on the network. 
one died, and i replaced it with the laptop. 
after plugging the laptop into the hub, it is able to access the internet with no trouble. 
neither it nor a desktop are able to see each other, however. 
if i pull up a network map on the vista pc, it shows the switch and the other pc. they do not show up in network though. 
i am also unable to see the laptop from the other computers at all. 
i have made sure that the workgroup name on both the laptop and &quot;pc2&quot; is the same. 
i have gone through all the troubleshooting tips, as well as done everything i could think of. 
i just can't seem to get them to see one another. 
both the router and the hub are made by linksys, though i don't have the model numbers handy. 
if this has been addressed already, i apologize in advance for asking again. 
i searched, but may have missed it. 
thanks for any help anyone can grant.
