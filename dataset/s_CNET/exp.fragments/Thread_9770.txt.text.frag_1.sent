i recently purchased a pny attache 128 mb jump drive and it works on every computer that i can find except my primary work computer. 
that computer is running xp pro and it is a dell. the funny thing is....that it works on that computer under my coworkers usernames, just not mine. it recognizes the drive (a message pops up saying that the usb port is not high-speed), but when i go to my computer, the drive is not listed. 
are there settings that i can change? 
help!
