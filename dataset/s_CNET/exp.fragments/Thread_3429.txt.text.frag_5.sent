thanks for the response, yes i can get the bios from either graphics card but when using older card the display is so much slower that perhaps i was fooled into thinking it had failed. 
this older card is an amc pn 109-40600-10 (ver 2.0)requiring an ati technologies 3d rage 2c driver. 
i googled the card id and found that this card appears to be an apg card. 
could this be a hybrid, agp circuitry on a pci format card and could this be part of the problem? 
my new msi card requires an ati radion x300 driver, is it possible that these two ati drivers are in conflict within xp? in the xp device manager the ati 3d rage 2c has a yellow circle with a black exclamation mark. 
in add programs wizard it says cannot start code 10. google says code 10 is a registry error. 
ms xp help????? and support????? instruct to get sp 3, done that but no improvement. 
the instant that i remove the msi card this error indication disappears, put the msi card back in and the error indication returns. 
ms says cannot help, look elsewhere. 
by swapping monitors on each card and changing the card start up priority in bios i can prove that both cards, card slots and monitors are all functioning perfectly, i must assume therefore that the motherboard is also functioning to spec. 
right now i am at my wits end because these two cards will not work and give me the dual monitors that i need.
