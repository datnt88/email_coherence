ive been using yahoo for my personal account & gmail/google for my business account, to not be dependent on my ip provider. 
(i've switched several times)&gt; as clearwire sucks, verizon is good for wireless, and time-warner cable has the speed for those fast downloads @ home. 
i also recommend using mozilla firefox and thunderbird, as it is much more secure and less likely to be hit with worms, viruses, trojans and denial of service attacks if properly defended by a good anti-virus/anti-spyware program.
