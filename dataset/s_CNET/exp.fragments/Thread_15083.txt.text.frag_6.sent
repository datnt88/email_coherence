sorry, but lba and iba are just some pixels about on the screen, much like the 0 and o characters. 
that's a zero (0) and a letter 'o'. 
changing the intel boot setting is as you and i know, not the issue. 
can i ask in the future you take care with the acronyms since it can lead many astray. 
this one is just too close to lba (large block addressing) which is a hard disk addressing method which can cause data loss if played with.
