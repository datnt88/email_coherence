by ics im assuming you mean internet connection sharing. 
if so, yes, i am using ics - have re-run the network setup wizard several times, making sure all the settings are correct (workgroup name is all the same, etc.) the ip address of the notebook (host) computer is 192.168.0.1 ics is enabled only on the notebook (host) computer. 
is there a way to test the hub to see if it has gone bad? 
i tried to ping the other computers and the request timed out
