thanks for the link, i will study the contents. 
the iba change in bios refers to the intel boot agent pre-installed on my box. 
from what i have learned it is a tool that the computer reads as a drive that can be used to remote boot a machine. 
i assume it was installed so the gateway techs can help people like me. 
i disabled it in bios because no matter the configuration i came up with, this little tool tried to boot, and i thought it was preventing my other drives from being read first. 
either way, the iba makes no difference on my ability to boot to the drive i want, i have enabled and disabled it and tried to boot both ways.
