i find that bridging did not let the host device (such as the 315) count up more devices. 
however shows some dsl modem router so that's a second issue. 
that is i have yet to meet anyone that has turned a dsl modem router into a router. 
that's 2 big hurdles why this does not work. 
and on top of that, the ec315 is usb and wifi so again too many hurdles here. 
too many wrong parts.
