ok guys, help me out here. 
i always thought that the reason for having a switch is for when you have exhausted the ports on your router. 
now you are recommending the opposite...use the ports on a switch first then only use the router ports if needed. 
i am just switching over to a dir-655 and if this scenario is truely recommended i may as well go ahead and add a switch from now. 
could you explain the rationale for me? 
thanks.
