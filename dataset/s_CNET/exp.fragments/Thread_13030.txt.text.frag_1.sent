since external hd's are pretty inexpensive - most are around 150$ it seems like the quality should be a big factor in which one you buy. 
which external hd is most likely to last the longest. 
is there a best brand or any difference between brands. is it true that an internal hd will generally last longer then an external one, why is that? 
thanks
