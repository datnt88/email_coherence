- the cable is good from 2wire to netgear - he tried to plug laptop in directly to netgear switch, did not work. 
- nothing else connect (at this moment) other than the blue-ray. 
driving me crazy. 
i don't know what the fix is. the netgear switch is brand new. 
i wanted to just test by bringing my regular ol' router from my house and replace the netgear switch with it, then the thought occurred to me that there will be two routers connected and that won't work.. or, at least i don't know how to configure two wireless routers on one network. 
is the answer somewhere in the dhcp settings of the 2wire modem/router? 
if so, what settings need to be changed? 
help
