thanks! i think i found it! 
do i just create a new folder, but the file and the renamer in it, then transfer the folder to my flash drive? 
do i take the renamer out of the folder after i execute it? 
again, thank you! i think we're on to something here! 
i was confused because on the flash back tutorial they have, they didn't give me a link for my specific motherboard.
