but make sure you evaluate the effectiveness of one before committing to more. 
xr is an improvement for a/b/g but it isn't as good as mimo. 
there are some mimo-xr units in the market but they are from small companies. 
if you choose it, again make sure their firmware supports features that you need. 
good luck in your project.
