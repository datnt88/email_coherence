yes https will encrypt data, but even if your browser encrypts the data it is by far less then what the server encryption is. 
basically, if your browser does encrypt the data that means it must recieve a encryption key or generate one. 
both of these can be caught durring the transmission. 
if the encryption key is generated via algorithm and you are sent the algorithm then all you need is to procure the algorithm and inplement the propper variables.
