i have built a system with a msi k7n2 delta-ilsr with an amd athlon xp 2400 processor. 
i have a quantum fire ball 30 gig hard drive. 
when i'm doing work especially when i'm online the computer beeps once and restarts at the same time. 
about a month ago the power supply burned out and i replaced it thinking that was the problem, but that is not the case. 
it's back to doing the same thing. 
please help!!!!
