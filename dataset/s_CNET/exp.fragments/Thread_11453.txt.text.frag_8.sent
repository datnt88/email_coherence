although the computer could see the card and all looked correct, the antenna for the card was not plugged in! 
i don't want to presume the obvious here, but if that card is working and everything is connected, it should at least &quot;see&quot; the wireless signal even the computer cannot join it. 
satisfy my curiosity, check the antenna on that card, please p
