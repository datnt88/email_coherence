i have had to reinstall windows several times on this compaq computer. 
the reinstall leaves most of the hard drive intact but updates and some programs are lost. 
after the last time i did this i still couldn't boot up. 
hp after diagnosing my poblem said my only alternative was to order and reinstall windows xp. i did this without thinking ahead. 
i should have put in a different hard drive but i didn't. the windows cds 5 in all not only reinstalled the os it also reformatted the whole hd. i lost about 40g of personal information(pictures, music, extra programs etc.) so if you have to reinstall, do it on a new hard drive you can always reinstall the original hd and move your data. 
lesson learned the very hard way.
