i checked out that link and runtime software actually doesn't recommend their product for use with drives that have physical problems. 
they site drives that make strange noises and stop spinning as an example, so i suppose this applies to me. 
i've already spent $200 dollars to have the data recovered, it just seems to be corrupt now. 
i'm wondering if i have any options at this point. 
thanks for the tip though
