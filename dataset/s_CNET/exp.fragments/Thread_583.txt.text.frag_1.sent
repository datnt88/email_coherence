i'm in the market for a new desktop and would like some advice on making the right selection. 
my primary use is for viewing and editing photos using photoshop. 
i plan on upgrading to the most current edition of photoshop along with the purchase of the desktop. 
i won't be upgrading my monitor. 
could you make some recomendations as far as system requirements to help me select a system?
