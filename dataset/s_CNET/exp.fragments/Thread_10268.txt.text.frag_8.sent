i recommend returning it as well. 
i've got the linksys g setup in an almost impossible house to try and get a wireless system to work. 
&quot;g&quot; has high data transfer and long range. 
i think i was lucky. 
i bought a linksys g router and wireless notebook card and it worked flawlessly out of the box. 
however, i suggested a friend try it. 
he needed to return it. 
also be advised the linksys customer service help is inept. 
i had to call three times to get an answer on possibly upgrading the router.
