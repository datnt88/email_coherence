and locked! 
sorry, but this discussion simply cannot go forward. 
even if we could forget about the stated use of illegal drugs, (which i personally could not), the fact that you say you are trying to fix a computer that by your own actions is unserviceable, behind the owner's back , is just not anything we can discuss in these forums. 
i am not at all sure that this is some sort of &quot;story&quot;. 
whether true or not, it doesn't matter. 
we can't help. 
i suggest you get professional help. 
i mean of course for repairing the computer, but if you take my meaning in any other way, that is up to you. 
like i say, locked!
