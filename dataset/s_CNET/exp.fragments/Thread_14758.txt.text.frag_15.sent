which asus board are you running? 
i'm using the a8n-sli and you better believe it's power hungry. 
in fact the mainboard manuel has a graph telling you what wattage you will need with certain cpu's and add-on cards. 
i'd suggest anyone buying this beast pay close attention to that little graph especially if you are running two video cards in sli mode.
