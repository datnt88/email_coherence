if it is a hardware problem then it sounds like you've identified it. 
but if you can start in the safe mode then do it and go into your device manager which is in the systems folder located in the control panel and see if you have any yellow and black exclamation marks. 
if you do, then reload the drivers if you can or uninstall said item if it is not crucial to the running of your machine. 
you might also look into the add/remove programs in the control panel and if you can remove all programs like automatic installs from microsoft that were added right before your machine started acting up. 
now like i said, this is all dependant on whether you can boot up into safe mode or not. 
good luck.
