...it's one of the old (festooned with molex plugs!) 6800 gt/ultra models, isn't it? 
if it has two molex plugs (i'm sure they're &quot;male&quot; because they have pins btw), you have to provide two power connections. 
this is because of the amount of power draw some of the early graphics cards could suck up. 
apparently over 100w (ouch!), which could heat up a single molex plug and cause problems (ati's old 9800pro also used to melt molex plugs for the same reason). 
i can see your next post now..... &quot;can i used 2 y connectors? 
i don't have enough psu molex connectors!&quot; as a side note, the two black wires in a molex are usually a common negative (unless you have a very high end psu).
