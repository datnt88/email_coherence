i thought you wrote &quot;50m away from in los&quot; so what are you saying here? 
if it's not in line of sight (los) then it's not and all bets are off. 
you can forget about 300 mbps since that's under ideal conditions such as 6 meters or less with no obstructions. 
try plain old 802.11g settings on the router.
