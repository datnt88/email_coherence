well, i finally was able to get to it. 
i unhooked the modem from router and disabled all the firewalls on all the computers (windows firewalls as well). the computers still showed to be connected to the router, but when i tried the new view, it still gave me the message that there was no list. 
i also tried just using 2 computers on the network and got nothing. 
do you have any other suggestions? 
thanks raymon
