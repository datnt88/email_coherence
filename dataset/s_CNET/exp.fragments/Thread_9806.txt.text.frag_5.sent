just purchased an hp m7060n from circuit city for $950.00 (does not include monitor). 
this model was just introduced last month. 
so far: difficult to network with other pc (gateway). 
has frozen up a few times. 
vhs to dvd transferring doable-but not very easy. 
tech support from hp: 1) very fast service. 
never have to wait 2) usually rep from india and difficult to understand...but be patient... love the tv function (watch and record) fm capability is ok..several local stations hard to get in clearly. 
all in all i had a rough transition period with this pc, but patience is not my virtue..and as i get more familiar with it...it's working out ok. you should probably check out sony's media center, too. 
i've heard good buzz on it as well.
