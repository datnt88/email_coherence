i have a stick of 256mb pc133 cl3 single sided memory that doesn't work on 2 intel motherboards. 
i know the memory works because my friend showed that it did before he gave it to me. 
on one system the bios sees the stick as 256 on one slot and 64 on the other. 
boots until right before the logon screen then reboots. 
on the other system it doesn't recgonise it at all and beeps. 
i want to know what is the problem here... is it just incompatable? is the memory bad? is the cl rating too high to be supported on the motherboards?
