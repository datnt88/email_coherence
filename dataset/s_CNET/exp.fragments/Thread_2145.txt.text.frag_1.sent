i just bought a new epson stylus photo r1800 and am trying to get it to run on my new pc with vista. 
i have downloaded the newest vista (32) drivers from epson and all appears to have been installed correctly. 
i have checked the system properties and it appears the usb is installed correctly as well (you can run this with a fire-wire, but i don't have a port on this machine). 
i can print a test page from the printer only (unplugged from the computer), but there is no communication with the printer and the computer when they are connected with the usb cable. 
i've made 3 calls to epson with no help. 
they just say that the r1800 &quot;should work with vista.&quot; 
sigh... i have done a system restore on my machine 3 times to remove the drivers. 
you can't simply uninstall them, the system crashes (!!). i tried the printer out on my laptop with xp and it appears to run fine. 
any thoughts, help, advice would be greatly appreciated. 
i have spent about 10 hours on this and am starting to lose my mind. 
and i haven't even tried to install my new epson v700 scanner yet! thanks, kalli
