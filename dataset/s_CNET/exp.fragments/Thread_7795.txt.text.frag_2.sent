fyi - don't place your full email address again on these or any other forum, it only invites future spam. 
as for your problem of recovery cd, usually most recovery cds say so and include thier orgin like from dell, hp, gateway, etc as the oem source. 
a true os full/upgrade version will have ms all over it and state it. 
if you have an oem os version, it has to be loaded to that maker's type of system otherwise it just won't work. 
plus, of course you need the &quot;product key&quot; to validate its loading, etc.. hopefully, this answers your question, if not please explain further your query.
