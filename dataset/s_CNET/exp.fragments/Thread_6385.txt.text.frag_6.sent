it appears to be running. 
but, you have the similar(alike) ram together(next to each other) and that's not the way ddr2 mode was intended. 
you already note the colored slots. 
while it be working ok, to address your question, for the best performance all ram should be alike of same abilities, thus the same timing. 
i would think the ram auto-configured to the lowest setting and isn't in ddr2 mode -or- if set in ddr2 its not happy, possible cause for concern if pushed. 
if you can replace the ram slower ram to the higher ram, then that will be a better fit. 
but, for now, if it works you'll be advised of this area of concern.
