well bob thanks for your help but i've found a work around on this one. 
since i'm not a gamer and don't need all of that fancy stuff i decided to go this route. 
i totally uninstalled the drivers and supporting software and did a driver cleaner pro run (you can get this at - and downloaded the older catalyst 5.11 drivers with the classic control panel. 
so far running well.
