i hope this won't jinx me too! 
i have only been using mine for about 6 weeks to back up my new dell having passed on my 5 year old dell to my husband ( so girls that is the way to do it! 
mine was a special present.) my maxtor came with dantz retrospect express software for backups. 
so far everything is working fine here in the uk, but i would like a bit more flexibility than i am getting with dantz. 
can someone tell me it it is o.k. to use one of the other backup software programmes around, and if so i would be grateful to know which ones work best with maxtor one touch which i find is a neat way to have an external hard drive. 
i woud not dream of moving it around while it is working...no wonder people have problems.
