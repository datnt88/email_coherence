hello, i previously had dsl with my own combo modem/wireless router. 
i cancelled dsl and got cable broadband instead. 
i've already unplugged my dsl modem/router and have my cable modem hooked up, all is running well. 
i bought a new netgear n600 wireless router that i want to set up. 
my question is....do i have to uninstall any software or files from my previous dsl modem/router before installing my new cable router?
