i'm buying a new laptop for general school use and maybe some casual gaming like tekkit and stuff. 
im comparing mainly dell and hp, and i had some questions about their specs 1.dell with an i5 processor and amd radeon 7730m, with 6 gb ram or hp with i7 and intel hd 4000, with 8 gb ram 2.how good is intel hd 4000, nvidia geforce gt 630m, and amd radeon 7730m compared to each other? 
3.how much ram is good for high end gaming, just so i can get a perspective? 
4.what is your recommended hard drive space for a laptop?
