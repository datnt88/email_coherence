i have an old hp compaq presario laptop (sempron-cpu) which has an ati mobility radeon express series 200 graphics card. 
xphome sp-2. 
i have a driver dated dec/2005 (8.202.0.0) for it, and is the latest, as far as i know. 
i have located an newer &quot;amd catalyst&quot; driver, which indicates that their driver supports my graphics card. 
since ati is amd now, my guess is that it may be ok. i hate to guess about things like this, and am just inquiring here. 
can anyone verify that the catalyst drivers are ok with my old laptop ? 
thanks
