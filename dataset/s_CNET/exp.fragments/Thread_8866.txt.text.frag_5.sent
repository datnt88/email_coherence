i think the media server, which is not connected to my mini-network yet, is running windows server 2003. 
once i connect that machine will that help solve my problems? 
i absolutely do not understand networking. 
i can do most other forms of pc repair and the like, but networking and network admin stuff boggles me. is there a good beginner's tutorial?
