omg! i didn't expect such a setup. 
it is easy and economical for me to setup individual pcs rather than setting up thin clients and stuffs. 
i thought i could build a big size cpu with some extra vga outputs and usb ports for my project. 
so, i am going to set up some vertical desktop cpus, so that i can make a compact setup. 
anyhow, thank you for your kind information.
