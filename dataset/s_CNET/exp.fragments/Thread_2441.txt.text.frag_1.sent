howdy all, i live in a 3 apt house where we all share wireless from the 3rd floor apt. 
it's a dsl connection, over a g router. 
i am on the bottom floor, and cannot use my skype phone, nor ps3 or xbox. 
i have run a 100ft cat6 cable from the top apt to ours. 
i would like to install an access point down here to use my skype phone (which has no port, only wifi), and wire my pc, and other stuff to the access point. 
i have bought a netgear wnr2000 (recerted from tigerdirect for $20) to serve as the access point. 
my question is this: should i use the n router as the access point to better serve my apt, or switch it for the g router upstairs and use the g router in my apt? 
here are the two setups i'm imagining: modem wired to g router wired to n access point which is wired to pc, 360 and ps3, and wirelessly connected to skype phone and laptop. 
or... modem wired to n router wired to g access point which is wired to pc, 360 and ps3, and wirelessly connected to skype phone and laptop. 
intuitively, i feel like having the n right at the beginning of things would prevent a bottleneck, but i don't know if because i am wiring it to the access point if it matters. 
does the n or g matter if it's an access point? 
would i be better off getting another n router so the whole system is n? also, if you need the router model number, i can ask my neighbor and update. 
any thoughts? 
thanks in advance! 
cheers, alex
