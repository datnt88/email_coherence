yes i meant the ribbon cable. the stripe on the edge goes to pin one of both the mobo and the drive. 
not all drives show pin one readily, but after you reversed it, i think that it is now in the correct way. 
is the floppy drive controller enabled in the bios? 
[probably is, but]. is there a hard drive in the system??? change to c a for boot sequence and see what you get. even a message that there is no operating system is a useful piece of info. 
if the hard drive has the sytem files [the dos sytem files] on it, you can try some dos commands to see what happens.
