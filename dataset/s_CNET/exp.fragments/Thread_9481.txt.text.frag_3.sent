well, a notherboard that's beeping at boot is telling you something. the manual, or the customer service of the maker, can tell you what error on the motherboard causes 4 beeps. 
if the drive was only formatted, data recovery programs might (just might, not sure at all) be able to recover data from it. 
i'd start with recuva (it's free). 
have a look at the top-post in our storage forum . 
but not having a backup is risky, i'm sure you realize that.
