you could try to boot to a bootable floppy and fdisk it to ensure that the virus is still not residing somewhere on the partition this could happen if u tried to install over the top of the old os also are you using a manufacture's copy of xp or a licensed copy or ??? also for a while hp had a recovery consol added as a 2nd partition on the hard drive unless you deleted this partition it should still be there getting to this partition might be tricky as it is normaly accesed using f8 durring boot up but im not sure if it will work i would contact / look on hp's website for an alternate meathod for accessing the recovery consol if it even exists worst case senario: the virus made your hard drive useless by corrupting the mbr in wich case all you can do (to my knowledge) is replace the hard drive keep us updated
