seems odd. 
normally sound cards on desktops will have a mic in, line in and line out. 
it may also have a speaker out in addition. 
laptops may not have a line in. 
in your case, it must be line in and not line out. 
please confirm. the cdrw audio cable goes in to the line in socket. 
please post a feedback.
