only the program crashes, not the actual computer, and there has never been a blue screen of death. 
vista says the mjpeg codec is the reason for the crash. 
i'll try to download the codec package to see if it might work, otherwise i'll consider upgrading my graphics card. 
will all graphics cards work on my computer or can i only buy a select few that are compatible? 
thanks in advance.
