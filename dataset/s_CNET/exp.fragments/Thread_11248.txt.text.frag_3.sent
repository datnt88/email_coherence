i wouldn't try to play anything created within the last five, six, seven years on that. 
you will be able to play web games just fine, but you won't really be able to play any offline games that one would care about at this point in time (except maybe starcraft or warcraft iii). 
as said, buying an xbox 360 would probably be easier and cheaper. 
what games were you planning to play on this?
