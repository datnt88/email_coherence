hi, brechan. 
well, our needs are fairly low key, do alot of photo shop, no videos, alot of web surfing, no games, our grandson plays alot of games but he's only 6 so the games he does play are not graphics hogs. 
no, i wouldn't assume to get something that could never be put to good use but i seem to get so much conflicting information from the web. 
if your power supply is lacking, don't get this card. 
if you're looking at this card, you would be better off getting the new generation of this other card. 
stuff like that. 
i don't want overkill but certainly don't want to come up short either. 
have looked at the gt250, and the 5670( i may be off on these models. 
i'm going from memory not knowledge)but just don't know enough about this stuff to made a decision. 
i've tried to educate myself a little but it seems that there are so many variables that i just get more confused. 
so, that is why i was hoping one or more of you brainiacs that understand whats going on could help. 
i wouldn't think that this change should cost more than 100 dollars but money is not the problem, getting too much card is. 
again, thanks.
