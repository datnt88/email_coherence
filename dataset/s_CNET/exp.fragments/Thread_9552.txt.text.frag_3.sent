thanks for the link! 
trust me i do check cnet before any tech purchase i make. the thing is, that cnet hasn't done a router review in a while. 
i'd really like to see a &quot;router throwdown&quot;. 
something that takes the newer or most popular routers on the market and puts them head to head. 
some of the routers in the &quot;editor's choice&quot; either don't exist anymore, or have been replaced by a new model or line. 
i think an update would be nice. 
any other suggestions is still welcome!! sean
