i have seen at several places on these that several of you have or want to add multiple fans. 
why? 
where do the go? 
i am looking at the asus a8n-sli premium or the asus a8n-sli deluxe mobo. 
not sure of the difference between the 2 with maybe the 4400 or 4800 processor. 
so why do we need more than one fan? 
confused.
