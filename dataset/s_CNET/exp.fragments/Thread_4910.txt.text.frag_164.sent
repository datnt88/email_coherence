here's my fix. 
i believe it's a case/motherboard heat issue. 
i installed a 92mm fan in rear of case and moved the 80mm fan from the rear to the front of case. 
there is a second 3 pin header on the mobo near the front of the case. 
i connected the rear 92mm fan directly to the power supply, not the motherboard. 
i don't trust the mobo to get the rear fan speed correct. 
i put the rear antec 3 speed fan on high. 
i also updated the bios. 
i also upgraded the psu to a corsair 450. 
no problems since. 
shame on gateway for not providing adequate ventilation. 
i'm sure many units were returned. 
just look at all the referbished ones for sale. 
good luck.
