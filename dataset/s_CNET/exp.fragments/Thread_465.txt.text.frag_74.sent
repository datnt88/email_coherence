my mac g4 is my primary desktop which i bought in 2001. 
(it replaced a mac performa which i had for well over 5 years.) runs like a top; upgraded os to leopard. 
will eventually replace it with mac pro laptop. 
bought my gateway m500 6/03. 
have never had a problem with it. 
upgraded the cd-rw to dvd-rw last year and added ram. 
other than that, i've done nothing to the hardware. 
still runs well. 
only bought the pc because i needed portability + msn to keep my clients happy. 
now that a mac can do both, i'll be upgrading to the mac laptop next year.
