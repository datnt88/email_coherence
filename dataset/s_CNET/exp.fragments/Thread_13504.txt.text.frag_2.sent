it sure would be helpful if you supplied what system/mtrbd. 
you have in order to get detailed help. 
from what you described, now you know why the vendor didn't connect the leads to the audio, etc.. you should go back and see if they will replace the mtrbd. 
with one that's more flexible to connects. 
what do you mean by &quot;caps&quot;?
