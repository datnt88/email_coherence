the visioneer 5800 usb has a factory defect and visioneer refuses to replace the unit. 
it cannot be used without unlocking from the bottom, yet this scanner doesn't have a lock... it even says so on their website, they don't offer a fix, but will be happy to give a 25% discount on a new one. 
bad business... don't buy from visioneer!
