as indicated by the moderators some computers cannot go over 512mb of ram. 
in fact some should not even get up to 512mb. 
one of my computers is a 500mhz win98se that came with 128mb of ram when purchased new 4 years ago. 
crucial.com 
indicates the maximum for this computer is 192mb of ram and that is what i installed...runs good and with a geforce 2 gts agp video card, runs most current (but not all) high tech video games pretty good. 
stick with what crucial suggests for your computer, and even if they indicate a max over 512mb, anything over 512 is a waste (and may cause you problems) unless you do high tech graphics or video editing work.
