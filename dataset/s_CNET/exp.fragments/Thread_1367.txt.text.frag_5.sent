thanks for the tip. 
i found out another product today by linksys which actually does not restrict you to any particular media player/file -- and it also comes with a software which can supress other sounds on your computer (email notitification etc) while you're playing music. 
it's called linksys wmb54g wireless g-music bridge. 
check it out on amazon or manufacture's site. 
although i'm quite happy with motorola bluetooth adapters i'm going to try this one as well. 
cheers!
