is not knowing how you are connected to the internet. 
dsl comes in to the house on a phone line and cable comes in on the cable tv line.

airport express is designed for the smaller home network and is not designed to extend your existing, non-apple, wireless network. 
does your existing modem have a wireless capability or do you have a wireless router connected to the modem?
