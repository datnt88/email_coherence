okay, i have an issue and am not sure how to resolve the problem. 
let's start off with a scenario. 
let's say i boot the computer with a dvd in the &quot;e-drive&quot; and open the 'my computer'. 
it will tell me what is in the drive. 
when i eject the dvd from &quot;e:drive&quot; and replace it with a cd the 'my computer' will not update the cd-drive. 
the cd will also not do the auto-play (as do most cds that have an auto launch procedure). the cd-drive under 'my computer' will still show what was in the drive when the system was booted. 
even if i refresh the window it does nothing. 
if i double click on the icon it will still act like it's a dvd and launch a dvd player instead of a music program or the application. 
so far the only way to view the contents of the cd is to right click and explore. 
this is currently occurring to both my cd-drives so i'm sure it may not be an issue with them but something else. 
all the drivers are current and still cannot find the cause of the problem. 
what could be causing this issue? 
i am running windows xp if that matters to anybody. 
any help could be greatly appreciated. 
if you need more info please ask.
