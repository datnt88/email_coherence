that cpu is dissipating about 60 to 65 watts [ever touch an illuminated 60 watt light bulb?]. that wattage is being dissipated over a surface of about 1 square inch. 
what you see on the cpu is a heat spreader which is about twice the size of the actual piece of silicon. 
intel is simply telling you that if the air at that distance above the hub of the hsfan is held at or below that temp the device temp will be at the temp range specified in their charts, based on using their hsf. 
they can't provide the data for some one else's hsf. 
are you also aware that such a solid state device can have a useful life measured in tens of years running at 45 c? if the device gets past infant mortality [a month or so], it will possibly outlast you. 
certainly should last well past where one would have gone to a new computer with later super technology. 
doesn't seem that it is worth spending too much effort on. 
unless you simply take it as a challemge. 
then go to liquid cooling. 
there are a number of those available.
