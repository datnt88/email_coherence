have you checked the refresh rate you have the drive set for? 
don't know the version of windows so i can't tell you how to do it, but generally you go to control panel/display and under settings/advanced/adapter you can see the refresh, it must be 70hz or higher to avoid flicker. 
have you tried pulling it away from the wall, maybe put it on the floor for a test a few feet from where it is now, and see if it makes a difference, could be power cables in the wall creating problem (seen this once).
