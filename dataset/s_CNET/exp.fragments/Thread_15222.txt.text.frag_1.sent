compaq presario sr1950nx windows xp 2.4ghz processor 2g ram vid nvida 8400 gs the other day i was installing a new game and recieved a processor error. 
this was how i was notified of this issue. 
my processor has recently stopped registering as 2.4g and is now registering as a 1002.2 mhz. 
i've been trying to find answers with little success. 
i was hoping someone here would have an idea for me to try.
