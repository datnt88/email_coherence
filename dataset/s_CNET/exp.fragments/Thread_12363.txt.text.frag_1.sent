hi, recently my cpu dropped 3 feet and ever since my fan is being weird, it would make noise from a cold start up and stay at 2000-2020 rpm, once it hits higher rpms(2300+)the noise would get low and lower as the rpm goes up. 
anyway i can fix this problem? 
ty! -amjed my cpu: 3.0ghz intel4, windows xp, 500 watt spu.
