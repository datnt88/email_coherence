hi, i have a a microsoft wireless optical desktop 1000 keyboard and mouse which connect to the pc through one usb port. 
my problem is that sometimes everything works fine, and then other times i switch on the pc and there are no lights on the receiver and i cannot use the mouse or keyboard. 
i have tested both a different mouse/keyboard on this pc and also tried the wireless keyboard and mouse on a seperate machine and both seem to work ok. 
do i need to completely remove the drivers? 
if so, how? 
any other ideas? 
thanks for any help
