unless you're going to build the pc yourself, a specific cpu alone does not guarantee you'll get a pc suitable for you use. 
still, since it seems you just want a good entry-level general-purpose pc, make sure it includes a dual-core processor (athlon x2, pentium d, or core 2 duo). the price differential between them and a single-core processor is minimal. 
also, avoid sempron or celeron cpus which are cut-back (some would say crippled) versions of other cpus. the extra $100 (perhaps even less) for an entry-level dual-core is well worth the money.
