well, you surely need something to receive the broadcasted signal. 
that's either a dish (to receive satellite) or a dvb-t (terrestial digital signal) antenna. 
or your local cable company. 
or possibly your adsl-connection offers digital tv. we don't know, but you can check what's available where you live. 
for hd (high definition) there might be less options than for sd (standard definition). 
what do your friends, colleagues and family have? 
that's a good sign. 
i'm confused about you mentioning your laptop here. 
what is it's role? 
any receiver or antenna can be coupled directly to a tv. kees
