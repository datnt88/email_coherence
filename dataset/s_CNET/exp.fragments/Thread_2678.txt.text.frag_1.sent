hi mywd800bb-22jhao just stopped working one day.it 
came pre-installed in my gateway pc.it's only one year old.i 
bought a new hd&quot; wd800jb-00jjao&quot; & swapped the pcb.it spun up,& showed in bios but i can't see or access it.it 
shows in device mgr. 
but not in disk management.its an 80gb hd but in device manager it shows up as &quot;wdc rom model--sabre--..7.87 gb&quot;.in 
bios it shows as&quot; wdc rom model--sabre--..80gb&quot; im a total newbie so i am confused .all 
i want is the data back.all 
gateway & western digital will do is replace the drive.i could careless about the hard drive i just want my pictures & music back.so 
i have a few questions for any one who may know how i can fix this.i would definately send it to a data recovery company if i had the money ,but im a student w/o a lot of money & can't afford it. 
so my questions are ,is there a way i can access the drive by just finding a similar pcb? 
or am i going to have to find the same or similar pcb & swap & solder a chip from the donor to the dead pcb board? 
and last,i was looking @ something called cloning the broken pcb's rom ?there is a guy on e-bay that claims it will work &quot;dariusale hdd solutions&quot;i would appreciate any info on this topic thank you for your time & patience i'm @ a loss b/c there were no signs or problems b4 it went kaput, no odd sounds,beeps ,or clicking. 
i ran a diagnostic program(ontrack easy recovery) 2 try & get the data out (w/ the good pcb ) it spun up smoothly seemed perfect but ,failed the test saying it couldn't go thru w/ the test b/c of bad or errors or sectors or something 2 that effect.. hopefully you can enlighten me . 
thank you for your time & patience ,angela mdl#:wd800-22jhao 7200rpm 2 cache ide caviar date:08nov2004 dcm#:hscantjah pcb#2061-001292-000 ad made in thailand
