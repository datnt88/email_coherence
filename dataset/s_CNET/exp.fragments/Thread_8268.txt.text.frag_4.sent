for the usual i'd get the 229 buck unit at target and use it, pocket the bucks in savings. 
as to 350 buck laptops you have to keep shopping to catch the sale to get the best deals but is so similar to my hp dv6910us that it's scary. 
and i can write that xp in that system is really fast and usable.
