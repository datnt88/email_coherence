i'm thinking of investing in a hdmi pci card as my tv/monitor has a hd connection. 
so all i need to do is add this pci card to my motherboard and then buy a hdmi cable? 
and connect the cable from the pc to the tv? the only query i have regarding this is that would my pc sound also come out of my tv? that is ideal for me. 
i know i could have gone down the easy route of getting a vga connection for my pc but the hdmi graphics will be better and i might get sound.
