i thought i could consider verbatium or imation pretty name brands when it comes to dvd's. the thing is, these are dvd's that have always worked on this burner until this week. 
i will uninstall roxio since i never use it anyway, its just a backup system incase something doesnt work, plus it was there before i bought nero. 
i will try this and update if i still have problems.
