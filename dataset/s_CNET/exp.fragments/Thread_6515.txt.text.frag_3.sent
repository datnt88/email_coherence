hello, in hoaspital network both the machines are communicating through switches. 
actual problem is when i am putting both the machine togather on the network one of the machine is asking again and again for a restart. 
so i am thinking this problem might be related to an ip conflict. 
please suggest me. 
both the machines have static ip addresses. 
thanks
