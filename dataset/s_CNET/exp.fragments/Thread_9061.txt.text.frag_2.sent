but since you didn't post the make, model of the machine, members can't share if they had such. 
don't pass up posting the important details since the discussion fills with &quot;what is it?&quot; ok, go look at for articles and tools. 
here's the fast ide drive i used on a cheap box -&gt; i chose that one because of size and seek time. 
sorry but no checking of in or out of stock as this is a world forum so you get to search for such drives in your country.
