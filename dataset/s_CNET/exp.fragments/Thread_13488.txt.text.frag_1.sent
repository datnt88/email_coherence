i am having problems with one of my pc's ever since i was forced to connect it to a wireless network using a d-link dwa-140 wireless usb mini adapter. the pc is a dell dimension dxp051 with intel pentium 4 cpu 3.000ghz, 2.99 ghz and 1 gb ram. 
network card intel(r) pro/1000 pl version 9.0.15.0 it had xp home edition version 2002 sp2 + office 2000 (i need to keep the old office as i work with certain software that function better and faster with the old ms office than with newer versions, which i have on my other pc). 
first i upgraded to sp3 and then i installed the dwa-140 usb adapter and connected to the wireless network. 
as soon as i did, word started getting hung on startup (won't even open properly, hangs itself). 
i initially thought it was a sp3 error, and tried fixes but still didn't work. 
as i need word 2000 more than the internet connection, i chose to uninstall the dwa-140 and work without the network. 
however, i now need to get back on the network/internet, so i tried to roll back to sp2, and check to see if word worked again, and it did. 
but as soon as i installed the dwa-140 the same problem occurs... when i click on word, it opens but gets stuck and stops responding. is there anyone who can help me figure out where the problem lies... how does the d-link dwa-140 usb adaptor manage to screw up my office programs (and i remember some other software issues as well, but can't recall which ones, as this was some time last fall). 
anyone who can help me fix this before monday... am in a real jam! =( thanks!
