i looked at the plasticase because we use such on our gear today. 
but we make some custom electronics and when we travel we can't replace our gear easily so we put it in cases we can carry on and will survive an 8 foot drop. 
it's all about the need. 
yours is the fine case to avoid small bumps and drops.
