and same results without the router? 
--actually, i didn't try tracing yet with the router bypassed... 1. is the firmware in the router current? 
--yes 2. is there some firewall is said router? 
--the router (netgear rp614 v.2) does have some kind of built-in firewall. 
3. did you put the mac address of your pc into the router? 
(check the manual...) --no, everything was auto-configured, totally plug and play. 
that's what bothers me; i made no changes to the router before the problem started. 
i'm not even sure how to manually input a mac address (or what it is exactly -- please forgive my ignorance!).
