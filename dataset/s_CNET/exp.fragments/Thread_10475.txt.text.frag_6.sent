it's not so much you need to use the utilities on it, its for the bootable feature so you can see if that dvd drive can boot from it. 
i use such all the time to tell if the drive has failed. 
then i put in a good drive and a test boot tells if it works. 
some want a &quot;test&quot; so this is the one i find to be easy without touching the os on the hard disk.
