et's $800 gamer is fair, but can be improved et's prices don't include shipping and some are unrealistic (for example, xp home is $90 minimum). 
the core2duo platform is the best performance choice currently. 
however, the asus motherboard uses an older nvidia chipset that has been superseded by the 650i. 
intel 965p based motherboard also have better overclocking potential than some nvidia based boards. 
nvidia just filled out its dx10 compatible geforce 8000 gpu series. 
ati will be releasing its dx10 compatible hd2000 gpus in early may. 
so, you'll need to decide if dx10 compatibility is worth the slight premium over older, but still good performing geforce 7000/radeon x1000 based cards. 
here's my suggestion for $1k or so: cpu: intel core2duo e6420, 2.13ghz, 4mb cache, $199 mobo: gigabyte ga-965p-s3, $110 or msi p6n sli, $121 ram: ocz platinum ddr2-800, 2gb, $154 ($35 rebate) or ocz gold ddr2-800, 2gb, $162 ($50 rebate) video: xfx geforce 7950gt extreme, $199 or xfx geforce 8600gts, $199 or sapphire radeon x1950pro, $160 ($20 rebate) or radeon hd2600 hd: seagate barracuda 7200.10, $90 dvd: lg/liteon/sony/samsung 18x/20x burner w/software, $42 case: coolermaster centurion case w/430w ps, $90 antec sonata ii w/450w ps, $116 ($30 rebate) raidmax ninja w/450w ps, $85 windows: vista premium oem, $120
