with what you're running, a 350-watt psu is more than sufficient... however, if you plan to overclock your components and upgrade in the future, then go for at least a 400-watt psu. 
a good deal would be an antec neopower 470-watt psu. 
if you wanna save some cash but still get a good deal on a very powerful power supply from the previous generation (late 2002-2003), try gunning for the antec trupower 550-watt psu. 
since i'm commenting, i should add that your choice of registered memory is not the wisest one... it's expensive and limits your choices... only servers use registered ram, apart from the athlon64 fx-51. 
unbuffered ram is definitely better and cheaper. 
your 3200+ has a 1mb l2 cache... meaning that its a clawhammer from the 754 socket generation. 
it's not a good upgrade path and may be phased out after the nforce 4/k8t890 boards are released. 
furthermore, it uses a single channel memory controller instead of the 939's dual channel controller. 
thus, it's performance isn't nearly as good as the 939 socket processors. 
i also agree that you shouldn't bother with 10,000rpm drive... its cost isnt worth the small performance difference. 
you'd definitely be better off with a larger capacity 7,200rpm drive.
