i'm having a similar problem. 
after the post info leaves and the win logo comes up, i get a 30 sec. 
flashing cursor. 
i believe mine is also related to a raid (asus a8v) problem; even though i'm not using sata ot raid. 
like old age, i don't like it but i'm learning to live with it. 
check back to this post occasionally 'cause if i find a fix for my problem, i'll post it here.
