this is typical for the following hardware issues. 
1. an overtaxed power supply unit (psu.) the p4 1.7 socket 423's i have at the office run on 400 and 450 watt psus. 
very stable. 
2. we had a batch of motherboards that did just that. 
they had the bad motherboard capacitor issue you can see at eventually the boards failed to boot at all. 
very annoying issue that can extend to other boards and power supplies. 
3. if you have to hit the reset to just get the os to start loading, it's not an os issue.
