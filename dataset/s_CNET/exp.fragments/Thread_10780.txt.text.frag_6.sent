yeah i see, or not ! 
okay so you're running a 64bit processor there but not using 64 bits - hmmmm really efficient. the reason i know that you aren't using it is because - windows xp isn't 64 bit ! 
only now is microsoft offering beta testing of windows xp pro 64 bit. 
and all the software available is 32 bit - all of them have to be recompiled for 64 bit when it comes out. 
are you going to need 64 bit power ? 
not really - nor is it neccessary. the majority of the power users will do just fine with the increased speed of a faster cpu and efficient running subsystems. 
just a thought !
