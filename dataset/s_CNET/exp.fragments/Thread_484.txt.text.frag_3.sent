you assume correctly. 
i'm sorry i confused you. 
i uninstalled the program and reinstalled it. 
i unplugged from the electrical outlet and then plugged it back in. 
i have tried everything that i have found when i searched &quot;google&quot; and the lexmark troubleshooting web site. 
thanks again flora
