any suggestions on how to image one drive to another? 
i've tried the included hdd (hitachi) cd to no avail. 
i also tried maxblast (maxtor) & that didn't work. 
i am trying to image my 30gb maxtor to a 80gb hitachi. 
both drives show up in my bios properly as master & slave. 
amd 64 & gigabyte board, xp sp2. 
thanx
