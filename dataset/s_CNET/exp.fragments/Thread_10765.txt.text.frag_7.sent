i wouldn't buy a pc as it's bound to come with windows unless you buy a dell with ubuntu from an american or us outlet as they are not available anywhere else. 
i'd rather pay more and get exactly what i want with the os i want as most pc's are limited as to type of ram, amount of ram, no choice in motherboards or bios. 
if i were you, i'd buy a premium motherboard, 650 watt power supply, 4 gbs of ram, a good graphics board able to handle whatever you intend to throw at it, then buy the next higher model for good measure. 
i'd make sure you get a good box to set it in, then buy the drives you want, at the price and size you can live with. 
being stupid will cost you more so don't buy into any of those rebate offers as most are scammers and the rest you could live without. 
shop for the lowest price without any rebates as you won't likely see any anyway. 
all your related hardware, shop for each a piece at a time until you get what you want at the lowest price but don't buy junk as it will cost you more in the end and you won't be happy. 
personally, i'd start with asus, enermax, kingston, nvidia, lg dvd drives, zalman, maxtor diamondmax hard drives, logitech gaming high end mouse and a good solid keyboard like logitech but unless you have a real need, stay with the wired hardware as wireless cost more, require batteries and may not stay the distance for as long as wired. 
if you press me for a wireless mouse, then i'd have to say go with logitech's vx mouse as it takes a single aa battery and lasts for quite a few weeks and feels and works like no other mouse i've owned. 
good for both laptops or desktops like mine. 
make shopping for each item a task upon itself, don't shop too fast or for more than one item at a time as you will lose your focus and cave in to buy it at a higher price.
