going on to a dfi lanparty ut nf3 250gb motherboard - and i have a choice of two athlon 64 3400+ cpus: ada3400aep4ax lbazc 0510apmw or ada3400aep4ar caa2c 0531epmw from the best info i was able to find - i think the ar is a clawhammer (it is also the newer chip), and the ax is a newcastle. 
(but i don't know this for sure) i am not a big ocer, but if i want to, i would like to have that ability, that is why i choose this particular m-board, and the lead question for picking one of these two cpus. 
i will be running xp-pro (sp2) tyia for any and all assistance - dam j
