i was given an external harddrive which i set up and put pics and files onto and i accessed it a couple of times and then left it for quite awhile. 
when i tried to open it again i got no response. 
the green light was on but can't find anything on my pc to show me where to open it. 
i have windows xp. the harddrive is an lacie . 
not real savvy with this. 
can someone walk me through what i may be doing wrong as it is a nuisance not being able to access the info on it. 
thanks.
