i agree...pretty warm for idle with a decent hs fan. 
have you double checked the installation or contacted the mfg tech support for suggestions ? 
sure the temp device is accurate and working ok ? 
i'm running an i860 with a xigmatec hs fan...at idle it's 30c or less at at load it barely reaches 50c. 
ambient temp is 73f.
