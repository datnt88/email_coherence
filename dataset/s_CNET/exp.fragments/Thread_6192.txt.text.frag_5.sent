put the win7 disc in your dvd and boot from the dvd. 
choose custom install and let it whack your existing windows installation on c:. when you're done, you'll find a windows.old 
folder that has all of your old documents & settings and the old windows tree. 
but don't depend on that windows.old folder -- backup your valuables before doing the clean install!
