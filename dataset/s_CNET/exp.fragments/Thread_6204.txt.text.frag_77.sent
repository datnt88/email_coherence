dropbox and many of the other services are handy and convenient, but they lack a great deal in terms of security. 
that has always been of concern to me, especially in regard to client and customer data. 
jungledisk provides a great deal more security and is very affordable. 
security-wise, files are encrypted at rest as well as during transfer. 
in addition, you, rather than jungledisk, control the encryption keys. the downside is that jungledisk is slightly more challenging in terms of initial setup, but nothing that most users could not accomplish. 
tonido is also a very handy service. 
one big advantage with tonido is that your files are never stored in the cloud; they are shared directly between the users' computers with tonido servers handling the encryption during transmission. the sync and sharing components are slower than jungledisk, but the web access is very good.
