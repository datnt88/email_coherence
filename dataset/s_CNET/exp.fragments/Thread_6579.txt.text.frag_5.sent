i suggest that instead of choosing an lcd with 1920 x 1080 resolution, you opt for one with 1920 x 1200 resolution. 
interestingly, the 24&quot; dell ultrasharp mentioned above is 1920 x 1200 with a 16:10 aspect ratio. 
if it will display 1600 x 1200 without horizontal stretching, it would maintain your perfect 4:3 aspect ratio, still using its native resolution with no ugly interpolated pixels, albeit with black bars on both sides of the image. 
as mentioned, you might want to find one (or any other 1920 x 1200 monitor) in a store and play with it to see how it behaves at your desired resolution. 
you didn't mention what video card you're using, but is it possible that it maybe it does support 1920 x 1080 and 1920 x 1200 already? 
at the risk of stating the obvious, &quot;windows display properties&quot; will only offer the resolutions that the monitor itself will support. 
in any case, as mentioned, if you can upgrade your video card, you might be even happier with the results. 
by the way, with a crt, the shadow mask generally does not correspond to any particular resolution. the position of each phosphor dot does not correspond to an individual pixel at any resolution. 
at useable resolutions, the dot pitch is finer than the resolution. 
it's possible that if the recommended resolution is 1024 x 768, that you are approaching or even exceeding the dot pitch at 1600 x 1200. the image might be a little blurry and not really yielding the resolution that you think you're getting. 
just for fun, try looking at your crt under some magnification at different resolutions.
