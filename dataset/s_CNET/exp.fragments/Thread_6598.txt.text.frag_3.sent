if this was my card, i'd get it out and do a few things. 
1. inspect the card for bad caps (see that on google) 2. pull the heatsink and replace the heatsink compound. 
3. clean the card of all dust and check the fan after i reinstall it. 
4. leave the case cover off the pc and point a fan at the open pc to see if this is heat related. 
5. i didn't write about drivers. 
but check the usual forums to see if folk have a favorite version.
