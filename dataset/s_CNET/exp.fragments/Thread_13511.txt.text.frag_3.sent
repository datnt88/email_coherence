the whole heatsink/fan contraption sits on top of the gpu area. 
it connects with about 9 screws, all as tight as i can make them without worrying about cracking the board. 
the fan works, i've even made sure it changes speeds. 
i applied more thermal paste, and it helped a small bit, but it still climbed to 101c before i shut it down. 
on the desktop it idles at about 54c, which is higher than it used to, but as soon as anything graphics heavy happens, it shoots up quickly.
