two ideas. 
1. wmp54g and xp sp2, and the pc with wmp55ag. 
you may have found where some model isn't playing wep. 
a call to linksys may reveal the issue. 
i have not looked at the linksys web site since that's your job. 
2. i ran into one glitch on a friends network. 
they had the number of clients set too low. 
they had 5 machines and set the wap/router to 5 dhcp clients. 
doubling that fixed it. 
i did not investigate why this is so. 
i leave it to others to ponder such things.
