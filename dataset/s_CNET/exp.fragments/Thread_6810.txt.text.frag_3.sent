you might run into issues with older/obscure titles, but any popular game released in the past 3 years will run fine. 
you will need to budget for more ram (2gb) than with xp pro (which runs fine with 1gb). 
xp 64bit is not a good choice because few games supported it and it doesn't have the ability to mimic xp (and thus fool games into running properly) as well as vista 64bit.
