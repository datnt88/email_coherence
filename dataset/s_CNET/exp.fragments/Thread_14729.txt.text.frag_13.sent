it took a while (reason unknown) but artifacts (different type of artifacts but still rendered in a grid pattern)have presented themselves in the win98se system. 
so, i guess it is a video card gone bad. 
any of you hardware guys out there able to explain to me why this age ailment does not present itself all of the time and can work fine for an extended period of time and then there it is again? 
this occurred on both systems. 
what is physically happening to the card itself that would cause intermittent problems? 
i'm just really curious. 
though heat has been brought up a few times here, i can't help but think &quot;nothing has changed with my set up which has worked for years, why should heat all of a sudden be an issue?&quot; 
though not much of a gambler, i found a duplicate aiw 9700pro on e-bay and won the auction at $79. 
(reassemble link to view) _w0qqitemz8800177740qqcategoryz40158qqsspagenamezwdvwqq rdz1qqcmdzviewitem i have liked this card for 3 years and this auction said it was never really used. 
i know it is a risk but i took the chance so i will be hopefully back to where i was before when the new old card arrives. 
again, i'd love to hear an explantion of how these problems could manifest themselves in the way that they have. 
and i would like to thank all responders for the guidance i have received.
