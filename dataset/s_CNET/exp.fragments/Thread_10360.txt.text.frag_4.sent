i don't know if you are still having this problem, b/c your post is old, but i had the same problem with my creative zen micro. 
i don't think it is your usb ports - i had the problem on my dell and then on my toshieba tecra - where i plug in my device but the zen software does not see it - but napster sees it. 
with some (or perhaps all and i never noticed) usb drivers, you have to use the same port that you used when you installed the device. 
but i think your problem is just a creative problem. 
i don't have the problem with other mp3 players that i have (iriver) and i dont' have it with other usb devices i use on my laptop.
