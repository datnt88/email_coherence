tore it down like you guys recommended . 
unplugged everything except mouse and keyboard. 
have no on board graphics so i tried 3 different cards ... not at same time. 
used different connections each time and swapped the ram around even going down to one at a time i did find a bad stick and removed. 
none of this worked though unfortunately. 
so i ordered a new mobo. 
tried it all again still having same problems. 
is it possible it could be the processor? 
i cleared about cmos pins and battery for a little was getting same results. 
all of this was done on cardboard with only essentials attached. 
also tried hooking everything up for no reason but to try it lol.
