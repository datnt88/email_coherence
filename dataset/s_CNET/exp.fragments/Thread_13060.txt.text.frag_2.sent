a. does this make sense? 
yup. 
b. what type of performance can i expect when i'm backing up to the mybook via a wireless connection? 
most find such &quot;sluggish&quot; compared to usb 2.0 or firewire connected drives. 
let's use the 10x slower than for a ballpark number. 
c. if i already have a wireless network and router do i need to by the world edition or would any, less expensive, hard drive do the trick? 
never saw that one so no comment. 
d. also open to advice on best places to buy external drives what country? 
here i pick up drives from sales at stores, newegg.com and geeks.com. 
you might not be able to get such but at less than 150 for that 500gb usb 2.0 drive it's very tempting. 
-&gt; let me share my solution. 
i didn't bother with flac since i couldn't hear any difference from the pods or over headphones. 
so on the pc i ran cdex and took the defaults. 
i'm done and a audiogeek i know is still ripping months later.
