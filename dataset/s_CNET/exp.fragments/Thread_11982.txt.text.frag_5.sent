i'm not sure if i found the right list but my modem model(dcm305) was on the list of cable modems approved for use with the comcast high-speed internet service at this list might not be up-to-date so could you please check if mine is on the list you were referring to or send me a link? 
also, i've tested my download speed and it's maxing out at only 1.5mbps when it was maxing out at 6.2mbps only a few months ago.
