in 2003, my wife bought me a sony vaio pc for christmas. 
3 1/2 years later, i have unsuccessfully attempted to upgrade my video card. 
first, i tried a radeon 9600. 
didn't work. 
then, i tried a geforce 6200. 
didn't work. 
both cards were unstable. 
finally, although this is hardly an upgrade, i installed a geforce fx 5500. the original card was a radeon 9200. 
i am getting ready to attempt my final upgrade - a radeon x1300 pro. 
i know the simple solution would be to buy a new power supply. 
however, sony vaio power supplies are proprietary - a standard atx psu will not fit the case (tried that too). 
another solution is to build a new system. 
i plan to do this early next year. 
i have read other threads that discuss power supply overloading issues when installing a video card in a system with an under performing psu. 
my solution is the following: i have disconnected the second internal hard drive. 
i disconnected the second dvd rom drive. 
disconnected the floppy drive. 
my goal is to create more power for the x1300 pro. 
does anyone think this will work? 
has anyone successfully installed an x1300 pro or similar card with an underperforming psu. 
does anyone have any additional advice?
