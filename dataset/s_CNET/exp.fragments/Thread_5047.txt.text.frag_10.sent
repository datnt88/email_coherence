from your list, all of them have dhcp disabled... why don't you try to enabled it .. in your router too.. unless you also disable the dhcp on the router... then you need to make all the ip in the same ip range address. 
you may also try to bridge the wireless and local internet connection ... (right click the network icon on the taskbar, open network connection, -- select wireless network connection and local internet connection (using ctrl key to select two items or more), right click and select bridge connections.. note: if this doesn't work .. then remove from bridge again.
