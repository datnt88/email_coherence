i purchased a computer from gateway.com and it was to come with an ati x1950 xtx video card. 
it came installed with a x1900 card. 
this was 2 months ago and i am still fighting with them to get the right card. the card they sent in my system is worth 1/2 the card i paid for. 
if you purchased from gateway you better open your case and see what they gave you!!!!!! i hope you got what you paid for. 
i did not!!
