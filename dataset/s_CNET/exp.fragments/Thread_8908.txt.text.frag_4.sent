i get an error trying to run ptedit32 (failed to start powerquest engine). 
i've not tried from a dos boot disk, however. 
i know acronis disk director works but that cost money. 
as for the f11 option, i can't speak to that as it may come from the bios or some special boot loader. 
personally, i'd not worry about such a small loss of space but, if you want to try anyway, i'd make a full hd image including the recovery partition as well. 
you could always wipe the drive and just restore the primary partition to the full size of the drive. 
it would accomplish the same purpose.
