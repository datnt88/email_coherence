i was in the same quandary just last week for the same two desktops. 
i even bought the 6030 but returned as soon as i found an open box at sams club for an hpm7767c, e6600 processor, 2 gigs ram, 600 gb harddrive, nvidia 7500, and a 22 inch monitor for a spanking 849.99!!! the the e6300 beats the amd in many areas, and vice versa. 
but i still would have gone with the amd for its more stylish casing, graphics card, and faster baseline processor speed.
