i want to see a wireless terminal that allows you to remote into your home computer and looks/acts like a big iphone. 
hardware would include a 13 inch touchscreen, an 'n' network card, a small video card, and a battery. the whole thing would remote into your home computer (or someone elses) and you could bring up a transparent keyboard on the screen with a screen gesture (terminology?). battery life would be stellar! 
and realistically this shouldn't cost more than $250
