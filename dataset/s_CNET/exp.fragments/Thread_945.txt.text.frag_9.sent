thanks bob. 
unfortunately the link you gave appears to be down at present. is it possible my current graphics card is too old/unsupported in terms of drivers to handle a widescreen monitor? 
bottom line: is this a problem i could solve simply by buying a more up to date graphics card? 
regards hajr
