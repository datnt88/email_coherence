hi, i worked in retail computers (big box stores) for awhile and the only &quot;good&quot; deals you get at that time of year are on the mid to low end and the &quot;special, two days only&quot; computers. 
these will not have a graphics card and will have one to two cores and 512mb to 3 gb ram. 
if you find a deal like the gateway quad-core gt 5628 (best buy has this week) i'd get it. 
specs: core 2 quad q6600, 3gb ddr2, 500gb h.drive, nvida geforce 8500gt graphics card and a dvd/cd burner get it with the samsung 2232bw 22&quot; mon. 
and an hp f4180 aio for around $1250. 
ends today however!
