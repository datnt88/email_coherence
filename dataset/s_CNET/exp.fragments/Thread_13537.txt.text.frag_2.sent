lee: it depends on what it is for, have used pretty much all of the methods mentioned but generally use an external hdd {portable for l/t). 
also have several flash drives and sometimes burn data to hard copy, dvd/cd. 
i have a stack of formatted floppies around here somewhere can't think of a good reason to keep them so they will likely disappear in the near future. 
best regards.
