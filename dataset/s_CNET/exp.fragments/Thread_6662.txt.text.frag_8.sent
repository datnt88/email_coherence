not a great one but i'll take it. 
one of the other moderators was having a similar raid issue and something they wrote had me remember a rather rare issue with some hard drives. 
for them they found the firmware in the drive needed updating. 
remember i don't have the full details to work with here but you are sharing some of the reasons we looked at the hdd firmware.
