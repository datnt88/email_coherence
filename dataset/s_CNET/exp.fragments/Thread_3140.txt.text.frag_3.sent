thanks so much ppl! but i fixed it! 
i swapped the rams from my other comp and now both compswork! 
wtf?? now i am back to the problem i previously had. 
i have to reinstall (repair) xp if i shutdown. 
cos it always says disk boot failure... that is, after the files are copied to hd and reboots it goes thru the install procedure and i am back to default xp no updates and some programs dont work if it helps i have foud that i can restart with the xp cd inside and restart only. 
if i shutdown im back to repairing the current version of xp. i tried installing multiple xp's and completely formatted and installed one xp but something is wrong. 
cos of this my comps been on for like 2 months! 
and its got a 400w psu really confused thanks again guys!!
