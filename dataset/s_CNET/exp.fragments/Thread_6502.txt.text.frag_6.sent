well, i don't know why this simple operation won't work for me, but holding down the 'option' key reveals only the 'post-selection' arrows, not the choices of boot disks which would get me to where progress is possible. 
i have it at that state now, and perhaps will just leave it for awhile to see if anything better developes. 
i'm doubting that without these choices being available a solution here is coming? 
thanks again.
