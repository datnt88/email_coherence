n to g vice versa won't cut it. 
dual band n (if wireless) gigabit hardware (if hardwired) cat 6 cable in lieu of cat 5 and a fast server hook up, fiber if possible. 
could get a little pricey since hardwired systems will need gigabit nic capability and wireless require n. sounds like a fun project, good luck!
