thanks for the info. 
i was planning on upgrading my video card to dx 10 to play &quot;world in conflict&quot; thats coming out in september. 
no way i'm gonna fork over the cash for a new os, dx 10 card, power supply, and probably a cooling unit to boot. 
there's still a lot of dx 9 games out there to keep me satisfied for awhile.
