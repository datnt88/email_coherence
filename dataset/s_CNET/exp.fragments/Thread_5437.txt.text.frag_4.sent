i pulled the side cover off and left it off. the fans/heatsinks are all fine. 
i turned it on and didn't even run any programs. 
i figure with the cover off and no programs running heat shouldn't be a problem. the computer still froze after a couple minutes. 
i think i'm going to try reformatting again and turning off the automatic updates to see what happens. 
i've heard of people having some issues with those before. 
and here i was trying to pin all my problems on itunes! 
i think my next computer will be a mac.
