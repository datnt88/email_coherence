how about you forget about the &quot;drive with feet&quot; for a while and get the $34.99 solution to this problem. 
this one will absolutely, positively, fit inside your g4 and does not have feet. 
i recently purchased 2 of these. 
one went into a g4 like yours and the other into a firewire enclosure. 
those geniuses at the apple store, i wonder what they were smoking? 
believe me, they were not what their title claims them to be. 
putting a cd/dvd burner inside an firewire external enclosure does not make it slow. 
if the place that sold it to you says that it will fit inside a firwire enclosure, it probably will. 
i would really like to take a look at a picture of this &quot;drive with feet&quot;. 
all the internal cd/dvd's i have seen have a smooth surface on all sides, except the front and back of course. 
by the way, do they still sell that device at that store? 
i still can't help feeling that they shipped the wrong thing to you. 
installing a cd/dvd into an external enclosure is really simple. 
usually 4 screws, two plugs and you are done. 
good luck how's mumsie?
