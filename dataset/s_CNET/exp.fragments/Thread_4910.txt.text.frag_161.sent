i've got the same reboot issues. 
i removed some memory (2 of the 4 1gb sticks) and thought it was working ok, but then the reboot started again. 
i think it may be a problem with the motherboard but i don't know where to buy a replacment that won't have the same problems. 
any ideas? 
i love how fast the computer is when it works.
