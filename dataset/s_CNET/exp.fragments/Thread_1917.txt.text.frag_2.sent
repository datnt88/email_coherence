some scanners have front panel buttons or a touchpad that initiates some software processes but the scanner operation is controlled by your pc. did you load the software and connect the scanner to the pc? hp's software was and may still be &quot;precision scan pro&quot;. 
it also will have a &quot;copy machine&quot; function. 
you can initiate the scanning process by opening the scanning application and click on the right buttons from there.....with your mouse. 
good luck.
