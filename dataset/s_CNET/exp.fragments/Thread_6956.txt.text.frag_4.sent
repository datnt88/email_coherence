thanks for all the help. 
1.) yeah i always buy normal atx cases. 
2.) the psu works fine in my dads system, i've used it for years. 
my dads computer also has a gig of ram. 
will the 400 watt psu i have be enough for my am2 system, i'm not planning on sli or an extremely expensive video card. 
3.} my dads computer has integrated and i still haven't decided which pci-e card i want for my main computer. 
4.}creature of habit i guess. 
i was thinking of getting one just for my os and games but i haven't decided yet. 
5.}that's just someplace to start i'll upgrade to a gig as soon as the money comes in. 
6.}i'm just trying to plan out what i want before the end of july. 
7. yeah sorry about that. 
i usually post on gamespot and they allow html tags there. 
also i don't know how to edit these posts. 
thanks again also is the biostar motherboard any good? 
am2 motherboards require a 24-pin main connection. 
mine has the 20 + 4 main connection that fits together and a seperate 4 pin for the cpu will that work? 
thanks again and i'll stop using html
