i also went from a 19' to a 20.1' viewsonic widescreen. 
its awesome! 
like the previous post said, most new games will support widescreen. 
and best of all, if your a huge world of warcraft gamer then you cant go wrong with a widescreen. 
looks amazing! 
dont forget that you must have a video card that will support the widescreen monitors. 
the better the video card, the better performance.
