the geforce line is aimed at consumers while quadros are aimed at business/professional users.

in practice, a geforce will run any app that a quadro will, but you might run into minor bugs (crawling lines, shadows not visible, etc). 
whether or not the bugs are show-stoppers for your work (or even evident in your app) is up to you to decide.
