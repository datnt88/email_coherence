after you ran ccleaner is when problems started,you could have deleted something you shouldn't have.i did that one time with reg seeker. 
these reg cleaners have the option to back up first before deleting. 
you can try avg anti spyware and your anti virus in safe mode. 
not sure if system restore will help.
