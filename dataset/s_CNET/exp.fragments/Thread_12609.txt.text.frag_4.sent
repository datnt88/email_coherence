update the firmware in your wireless router. 
manufacturer's website, make & model needed. 
broadcast ssid(you may want to change this to make it easier to connect) use wpa-psk(tkip) security. 
most wireless devices work best with this type of security. 
mixed b and g mode(n if available) use channels 1, 6 or 11. most devices work better on these channels. 
save and exit. 
power everything off for 30 seconds. 
power everything back on, wait 30 seconds,now try to connect.
