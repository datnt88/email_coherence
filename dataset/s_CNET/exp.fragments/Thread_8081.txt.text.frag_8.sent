well tough luck because they are the future... hdtvs is definitely widescreen, and only a handfull are 4:3... those who prefer standard monitors probably like watching videos in weird formats... with a widescreen monitor, i am able to have 2 web browsers open (or one webbrowser and one quarter tv (pip) and one quarter webcam... with a 4:3 20 inch monitor, it really doesn't look so good with all the open windows...
