i think i need some clarification then. 
in the review, it was stated that the pre-n router is compatible with b and g: &quot;belkin's router is compatible with standard 802.11g and 802.11b gear for now, but in order for you to reap the router's full performance benefits, you'll need to use it in combination with belkin's pre-n pc card adapter.&quot; 
am i misinterpreting this?
