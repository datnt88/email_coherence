since you didn't say what your budget is i'll just give some general info. 
for the most part just about any new pc will do the job. 
since none of the software you are using places a high demand on the pc. so, 2.8 ghz. 
processor 512mb ram, 120gb hd, 128mb video card will do the job. 
get nice 19&quot; lcd or crt display. 
xp pro has better networking and security than home xp. you didn't say what you office has 1 pc, multi pc, server?? do you need on site service? 
fast responce time? 
if you have problems? 
so a little more info would be helpfull.
