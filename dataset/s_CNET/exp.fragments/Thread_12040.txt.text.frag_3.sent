i had a similar problem which i solved by unplugging the computer, pressing the power button, removing the silver cmos battery inside the computer then reinstalling the battery. 
everything then started up fine. 
not sure why this worked but it did. 
my thought was to clear the cmos and start over with fresh cmos settings.
