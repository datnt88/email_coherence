i just installed partition magic 8.0 and it shows 160gb fully partitioned into 4 patritions, and all my apps seem to work fine, but it still takes two boots to locate the hd, the first boot indicates no hd installed. 
just installed a new uldma cable today, same problem. 
wierd. 
thanks for the reply.
