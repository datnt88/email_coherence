i have a compaq presario sr1620nx with an amd sempron processor running windows vista (did not come with pc). 
i am currently running the manufacturers video card which is an ati radeon xpress 200 and i just recently bought halo 2 for pc and it does not meet the required graphics standards to run it so i am looking to upgrade but i cannot find a decent graphics card that can run on a 250w power supply, that is compatible with windows vista, and that is 512mb. 
if you have any suggestions or comments on what i should do or buy they are greatly appreciated. 
thank you in advance.
