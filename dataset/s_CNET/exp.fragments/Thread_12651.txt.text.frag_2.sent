your wifi and the internet is a &quot;network&quot; so your request fails on the gitgo. 
however, we often turn on wep, wpa and even mac filtering to harden the home network. 
in answer to &quot;can other people steal file from me?&quot; the answer is very likely. 
do a little research about the evil twin problem of wifi hotspots and you quickly learn to distrust unknown spots.
