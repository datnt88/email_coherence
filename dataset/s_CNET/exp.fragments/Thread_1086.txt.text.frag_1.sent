i could really use some advice here. 
i'm planning on keeping this computer for years (5+). 
is this a good computer for gaming (would be be able to run today's games at acceptable speeds?). and feed back would be appreciated. 
also, how are these i7 processors and am i getting good value for this price? 
are dells reliable enough to last me 5 years? 
it also says this computer comes with a free upgrade to windows 7, will this computer be able to handle windows 7? and the reason why i said quick in the title is because i don't want to sale to end, not to be a dick.
