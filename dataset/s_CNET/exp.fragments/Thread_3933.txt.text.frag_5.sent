if you have access to forceps or small vise grip pliers, and knowing ordination of chip, try this as last resort. 
using maybe small wood/leather pads in order to not smash chip, apply to flash drive and clip on the pliers using just necessary force to keep it from moving. 
use a usb cable too extend the flash drive away from the port and allow ease of access. the constant contact may allow access to data if that's all it is, chip off pcb. 
you can apply a micro-drop of super glue with toothpick, again if ordination is known to keep chip in place, but apply pliers quickly before it sets.
