yeah, i got a bad case of &quot;brainf+++&quot;. 
90 is harder to achieve on a p4 ok. i learned in elementary school that hotter electic circuits peform less well. 
also later on that heat is not good for them at all so i just wanted to keep it as cool as i could, but using conventional methods as long as the results fall within maunfacturers specs. 
by my preferences, well within. 
i gather from all this that 50-51 c idle is acceptable and not unusual.
