it doesn't matter at all what's on a disk. 
it's recognized by my computer or windows explorer as soon as it is has a properly formatted partition. 
it's recognized by disk management even if not partitioned at all (it will report unallocated space). 
saying that windows doesn't recognize the disk is senseless, as long as you don't tell what part of windows (either my computer/windows explorer or disk management). the partition has to be formatted to have windows on it, of course. 
that's the only relation that's reasonable. the best drive for the os is the fastest one. 
size is unimportant as long as it's more than 10 gb (which allows for windows, program files, swap space, spool space and other minor uses).
