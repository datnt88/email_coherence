i always build my own pcs and ones for my family and friends. the pc at walmart or sam's won't have all the bells and whistles. 
furthermore, a lot of oem pc's have onboard video which is ok for office, but not watching dvd's or gaming. 
most of the cheaper end computers can have very cheap motherboards, power supplies can be lacking, as can memory, video cards, hard drives and sound cards. 
best way to tell is go to circuit city or best buy and look at that computer for $1500-1900 - you could probably build it for 1/3 the cost. 
when you build your own, you ensure you get all quality components, rather than the cheapest motherboard the manufacturer's could find. 
remember, you get what you pay for. the last system i built was am amd dual core with 2 gig of corsair ram, gigabyte motherboard, pci express video card with 512 mg ram, atx case, 300 gb sata hard drive, 550 watt power supply, 22&quot; samsung lcd dvi monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse, and samsung dvd drives - the complete system cost me about $1200. 
sounds like a lot, but it puts those in the store to shame...this thing smokes and easily upgradeable for the future (who would want to one asks eh?) the friend i built it for is very happy and he saved about $400.00 over the closest store bought system (and i used all name brand quality components). 
remember, if you build it yourself, you can customize it anyway you want. 
build it yourself.
