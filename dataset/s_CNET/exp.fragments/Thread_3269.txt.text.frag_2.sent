the temps look normal, very normal. 
without speedfan the fans do a fair job. 
running speedfan enables the fans to 100% and the machine is cooler. 
but don't put too much stock in those temp sensors. 
i get two different temps when comparing speedfan to everest. 
just looking at the numbers, your machine and drives are well below any danger zone. 
if you lost a drive it's not because of temperature.
