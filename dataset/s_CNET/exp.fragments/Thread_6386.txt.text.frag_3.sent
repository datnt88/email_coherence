still sounds like the usb connections on the scanner or your port. 
this may sound really dumb, but have you tried dipping your usb cables into soda water? 
cleans a lot of crap from your eyeglasses also. 
let the cables dry for a day and reinstall the cables. 
about six months ago someone else had the identical problem. 
can't remember the exact fix, yet the problem was with the usb cables. 
isn't there an electronic cleaner used on this stuff also from radio shack?? let us know.
