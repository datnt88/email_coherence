i have an hp pavilion dv9000 laptop where my wireless card stopped working. 
i was able to get it back working using linksys easylink advisor software and power-cycling my linksys router. 
anyways i am curious has to ideas about what caused it to temporarily stop working. 
i have heard stories about hp laptops' wireless cards failing permanently(this model has known overheating issues particularly with its motherboard). 
i really want to do anything i can do to prevent that. 
i use a laptop fan and i wonder if i should unscrew the back of the laptop to try to clean out dust near the wireless card. 
or are the wireless cards not really affected by heat issues? 
or could it be something completely different that caused this? 
thanks
