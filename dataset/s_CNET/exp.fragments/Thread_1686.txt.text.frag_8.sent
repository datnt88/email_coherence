as bob pointed out, networking with a router would simplify thing alot. 
i have just subscirbe to verizon dsl and here is what they sent me; a wireless dsl modem/router (it's actiontec model gt704-wg). 
so far i haven't got it connected yet. 
i am still learning, hehe. 
if i were you, i problaly would stay away from the bluetooth thing. 
sounds like a different animal to me.
