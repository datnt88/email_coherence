i've been trying off and on for a week to get this thing to work. 
first i followed the instructions to the t, 10 times. 
then i did a firm ware rev. the thing wouldn't let connect to internet on the host computer! 
but the connection was on. 
on the wireless computer i got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet. 
next i attached a linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back. 
then i hooked the 624 to the linsky router. 
now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet. 
i tried to go into the installtion url, but the operation &quot;times out&quot; every time. 
i almost got the thing to connect but the error message said there was a network address conflict. 
i'm running an amd64 3200, with 1g of ram with win xppro. 
i stay in germany using adsl from telecom. 
can anybody pllllease help.
