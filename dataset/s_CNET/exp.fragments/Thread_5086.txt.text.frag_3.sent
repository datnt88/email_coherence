my tablet will be 2 yrs. 
old around feb or mar of 2014. 
this problem started a few months ago. 
since i have b&n insurance, i have turned in my original tablet two times for the same tablet with a later manufacturing date. 
still have the same problem. 
i do use my tablet on a daily basis. 
would you suggest going to the newer model of nook or try another manufacturer. 
i think b&n is leaning toward blaming me with doing something wrong. 
model #bntv250a, software version 1.4.3.
