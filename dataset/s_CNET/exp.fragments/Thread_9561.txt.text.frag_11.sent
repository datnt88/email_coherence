why are larger drives more prone to failure than smaller ones? 
this is the first i have heard of this. 
tb drives are commonly used in business, whose data are much more important than mine. 
apart from banking info, my most important data are downloaded video programs, since i cannot afford to pay for them. the banking info i could store on a flash drive. 
you are correct in stating i must decide which data are worth backing up. 
my video collection would never fit on a flash drive. 
it is looking like my best bet is to purchase an external storage drive. 
although moving files would take longer, it would not be prone to an os crash. 
no matter how many backups i make, there is still a chance of failure somewhere. 
i can not afford to make the number of backups you mentioned. 
i still have much to consider. 
i value your continued input. 
thank you.
