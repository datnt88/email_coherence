i got a hp pavilion zd8060us notebook, it came with a dual tv tuner avc-3610/hp, it works fine with windows media center, but when i try to use the tv tuner with any other application (like windows movie maker) a popup says &quot;the video device is currently in use. 
close any other application that is using the device and try again&quot;, but there is no other application using it. 
what should i do?
