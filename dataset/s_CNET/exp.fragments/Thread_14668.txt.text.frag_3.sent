i've always found hp systems picky when it comes to ram, it just seems so. 
to answer your question, try entering the bios and reset it to &quot;defaults&quot; and reboot. 
if it works then, then re-enter(if needed) and reset any bios setting that reflect the old ones and reboot once saved. 
make darn sure the ram was supported by hp support webpage specs, as i said, it can be very specific and/or limited.
