probably with the 54g and definitly with the pre-n (see page 54 of the manual) i'm surprised that you are having problems with this the pre-n is supposed to have the airgo chipset which should prevent the router from dropping to the losest common denominator of card, but i doesn't seem to hurt you pre-n equiped computer's speed. 
make sure you are using the latest firmware in the router and drivers for the cards. 
have you tried calling belking tech support?
