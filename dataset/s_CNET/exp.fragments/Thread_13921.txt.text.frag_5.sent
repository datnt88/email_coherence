so it is really critical to make sure that you know how to clean an lcd. 
there was this ad i saw about some sort of tough plastic to protect your lcd. it comes in a variety of sizes like 17inchs, and 19inchs, and is supposed to make text on lcds look clearer. 
it is so tough that you can actually use your lcd as a cutting board! 
i saw an ad for this in pc magazine. 
i'll try to find it and post back.
