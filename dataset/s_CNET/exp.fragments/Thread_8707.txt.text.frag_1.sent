my small business is looking for a color laser printer we can run about 1000 prints on 110 lb card stock every other month - average of 8000-10000 prints per year on the heavier paper. 
(with regular 20lb paper used daily) i'm having a hard time locating a printer with specs to handle the heavier weight. 
we have an hp 3550 that did well with the stock for 4 years and only recently started to give us trouble (only on the heavy stock.) from there we discovered the card stock referred to in support documents was only 60 lb paper. 
our search has been slow and difficult. 
printer companies aren't clear what weight constitutes &quot;card stock&quot; in their general marketing materials. 
any suggestions?
