have a 450 b&w g3 and would like to upgrade the cpu to a g4. been to a bunch of web (like accelerateyourmac) sites and other than upgrading the firmware it seems pretty easy. 
what i'd like to know is, of all the upgrades available which one has the best price/speed ratio? 
also if anyone has any experience with the fastmac upgrades. 
thanks, bill
