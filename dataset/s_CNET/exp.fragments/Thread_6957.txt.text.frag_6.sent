they discovered the bug in mid january... i ordered it a couple of days ago... about 2 months time, maybe that was enough for them to produce corrected drives and ship them to newegg. 
hopefully it will come fully functional right out of the box and i won't have to get my hands dirty. 
though... if i plan on tweaking computers on a regular basis, i really should learn how to do this stuff...
