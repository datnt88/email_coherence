hello im new here, ive had my ibook for about 2.5 years and its been acting up recently, first it just started freezing up, usually with cpu intensive tasks like editing audio but the other day it froze while watching a youtube video, and today i go to turn it on and it freezes in the middle of the os x start up screen. 
i dont know what to do, im thinking it could be the hard drive but i dont know...can anyone help me out??
