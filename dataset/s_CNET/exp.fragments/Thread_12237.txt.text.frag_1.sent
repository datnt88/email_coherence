i did a fresh windows 7 installation on one of my pcs on the network. 
the problem now is i cannot ping that computer from any other computer on the network. 
i can ping the gateway and other computers from that specific computer, but not vice versa. the pc s ip address is 10.5.3.100 if i ping it from another machine it says reply from 10.5.3.108 destination host unreachable i have noticed that it is even replying from a different ip address help
