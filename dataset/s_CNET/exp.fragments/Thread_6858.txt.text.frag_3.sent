i don't need the vista drivers; i downloaded and installed the vista drivers on the vista rig, and the printer is working fine on it. the problem is with the xp laptops. 
i have tried downloading the xp drivers for the printer and installing them on the xp laptops, but then when i try to connect to the printer over the network, i still get that driver message.
