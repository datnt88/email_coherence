if the wieght of that hd is shaking the desk, then it certainly is a cheap desk. 
any noise is not good but if your old hd was exceptionaly quiet expect a little more with the 120gb though not that much more or basically the same level. 
i suggest you snug the mounting screws but not &quot;too tight&quot;. 
you maybe hearing the &quot;resonance&quot; of the system case metal and if so, use small rubber washers(provided they fit) or plastic(very thin) to relp reduce resonance. 
also, check your fans as they're a known source of noisy operation especially if you knock off dusty build-up, clean them anyways. 
you can try to set the system on a more sturdy area to see where the noise maybe coming from too. 
i hope this helps... good luck -----willy
