i'd think the newer supply fan could just be powered by the same 12v used for the others with a little rewiring. 
my guess is this one might be thermally controlled and that's the reason it doesn't come on when the 12v comes up. 
unless you just want to use what you have and not spend a few extra bucks, i'd look into something like this. 
you can get 12v dc supplies that are small and can handle a few light duty fans. 
you still need a little creativity to adapt them but it sounds like you're not short on that.
