i'm considering buying the d-link dir-655. 
has anybody tried it on wildblue satalite? 
also, i would like to print to it wireless. 
the dir-655 has a usb port on the back but i haven't seen anywhere where it specifically states that you can plug in the printer and do this. the printer is an hp 1310 series.
