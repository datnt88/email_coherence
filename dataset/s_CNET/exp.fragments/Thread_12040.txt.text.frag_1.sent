one day i decided to go off to the store and buy dvds to burn some of my files, when i cameback home my computer was running yet there was no display no nuttin on my monitor it was as if everything froze, the power button didnt work either. 
so i disconnected it. 
reconnected it and got a eeeee sound as if the computer wasnt feeling the power, like a car wanting to turn on but it wont. 
i thought it was the psu, i just bought one today and installed it, i connect it, and i kear the same eeeee sound, the sound i think comes from the psus ( not 100% sure but pretty certain) and i know that the spus is not to blame. 
i wanted to know what could be the problem? 
motherboard died? 
or in worse case scenario, cpu died?
