i'd think a flip out cooling pad that rests on the laptop case with the laptop on top if it is going to both raise the height considerably and take away that firm surface that keyboards need. 
unless this is a hard case item. 
as well, i'm not convinced that usb cooling is going to work if the power source is the laptop. 
consider that you're using energy from the laptop which generates heat. 
then you're trying to cool the laptop with some fan connected to it? 
this does not make thermodynamic sense to me.
