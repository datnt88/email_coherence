i have a couple of friends and connections close to where i live that could give me a hand if i dropped them an email. 
i understand the risk of making a small mistake and frying anything on it. 
another question, ok so i use a 64bit amd, right? 
can i get 2 and put them on a nice dual processor motherboard? 
do u kno a place where i can get a dual processor motherboard?
