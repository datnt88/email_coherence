i had numerous driver problems after upgrading to win 64. printers, webcam, dazzle 150. 
after contacting the manufactures and being told no drivers were currently in development i immediatly re-installed win xp home. 
new os's can be great but before up grading confirm your hardware has available 64 bit drivers.
