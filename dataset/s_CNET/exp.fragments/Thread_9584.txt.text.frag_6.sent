i see our posts overlaped i did see this one. 
a device on a switch cannot directly sniff traffic on another port. 
a port is only sent traffic destined for a mac address on that port and any broadcast traffic. 
you would have to use a special feature in the switch to get it to replicate the traffic. 
now in theory a compromised machine can do mac spoofing attacks to overflow that table of the switch so that all traffic is broadcast to all ports. 
not sure how effect that really is but it is a known attack method. 
you really should always assume your traffic is being sniffed. 
this is why almost all sensitive stuff is run over https.
