is to have 2-identical mini-vans running at the speeds you suggested and see which finally has a problem. 
i suspect both are prepped beforehand and then raced on separate tracks or times. 
then after 30-days see which may have more issues as yet another area to check. 
stuff happens no matter how its prepped but then again, the true nature of underlying problems comes more apparent when getting to the bottom of it all. 
if that isn't seen from all the posts here and elsewhere to paint a picture of this or that, then employment is assured.
