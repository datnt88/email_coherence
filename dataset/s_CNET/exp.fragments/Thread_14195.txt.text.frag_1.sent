the first time happened when i was using my windows formatted external (fat32 i believe) hard drive on my friend's mac computer. 
i'm not sure what happen because it was working fine but when i took it home it didnt recognize the drive. 
windows was asking me to reformat the hard drive! 
so i skimmed the internet, but i didnt even know how the problem occured. 
i had no hope left so i boxed the 160 gig hard drive for storage in case one day i might be able to save my thousands of photos and music. 
i bought a new hard drive and decided to forget the past and start fresh. 
this time i bought a 200 gig hard drive and again, i chose seagate. the secound time happen a few days ago, i bought a new mac book pro and wanted to transfer what ever i had on my windows xp desktop to my new mac. 
i was transfering some mp3 and pictures but then i stoped. 
i pushed the button down on the front of the seagate and an alert signal poped up telling me that i incorrectly disconnected the external hard drive. 
i then pushed ok and immediatly tried to reconnect the hard drive. 
now every time i do so i a pop up tells me that &quot;the disk you inserted was not readable by this computer&quot; and i can either initialize, ignore, or eject. 
i tried to load the hard drive on a windows and it shows up blank and asks me to reformat it. 
..... not again!!! gah! is there any way of saving my files with the file names! 
i looked at disk warrior and it seems to only help mac formatted hard drive. 
data rescue ii would get my files, but i wan't my file names as well. 
is there a way of just restoring the directory.. or something so that i can return it to the way it was? 
help!
