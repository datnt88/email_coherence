sorry, never going to happen. the market dictates you take a product to market when the bugs are below a certain threshold. 
you won't found bug free windows any time soon. 
but vista feels like microsoft's windows me disaster. 
and i did the windows 7 beta and it's impressive. 
even in beta form it seems to beat vista on key talking points. 
i'd wait it out and skip vista if you can. and about xp. it doesn't support usb 2.0 out of the box, drives over 127gb and sata until service packs and even then sata can be problematic. 
it's age is showing.
