morning everyone - i'm currently researching/looking for a 8 port, layer 5, load balancing switch. 
i was wondering if anyone could provide me w/ some some insight as to what your company may be using and also what you may recommend. 
i have already spent a tremendous amount of money upgrading our network and this addition is absolutely necessary but we are trying to acquire a lbs at a reasonable price but of high reliability. 
thank you in advance!
