i was wondering if i could play blu-ray in windows vista media center. 
i know i can play it with the supplied software and i got sonys $200 blu-ray drive. 
but i wanted to use vistas. 
im using a barebones shuttle pc with vista home prem, core quad, radion 2600hd with hdmi and i know every complies with hdcp.
