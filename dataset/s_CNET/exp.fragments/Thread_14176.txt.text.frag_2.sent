installing windows (all versions) is a long painful hunt for drivers for the machine and all accessories. 
there is never a step by step procedure for each machine from what i can tell. 
only guides. 
and there must be thousands out there making a fine living installing windows. 
what i would do is to recreate the machine just like dell delivered. 
use dell's restore media and all their cds supplied or ordered from dell. 
i do know some try the &quot;clean install&quot; or want that but i find many just get upset over the days and weeks of efforts to do that.
