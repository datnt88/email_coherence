both computers use w7 home premium, workgroup, not homegroup. 
each has its own user name, same as computer name. 
no passwords. 
sharing &quot;my documents&quot;, and 2 printers. 
i made a shortcut with the ip address, which is reserved, and that connects to the computer, and shares, flawlessly. 
its only when i try to connect to the named computer, which is displayed under &quot;network&quot;, that i am told that &quot;the network path cannot be found&quot;. 
i found the suggestion for the shortcut on another message board. 
i can ping the other computer, as well, with the ip adress. the name just doesn't seem to ring a bell.
