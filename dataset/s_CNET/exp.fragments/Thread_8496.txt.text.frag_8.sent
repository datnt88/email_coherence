if you have your restore disk or os oem that came with your puter, you transfer all files you want to save from the old hd and then make it the master and the new one slave, you can use the os restore disk to make this 20 gig run just the os. i think that is what you wanted to know. 
however, when i did the same with a compaq/hp the new hd was smaller than the old one and the restore disk formatted it to the smaller size. 
i have not tried to go from a larger one to smaller one yet. 
go for it. 
if it does not work, you can change masters and no harm done.
