1) are you getting any beep codes? 
first make sure that your ram,.ide/sata cables are secure and if you have a floppy the berg connecter isnt upside down. 
further more if there are no beep codes, the system sounds to start normal but doesnt post do one of the following a) brake it down to just the basics and add hardware till it posts, you may have damaged something dusting it b) check your vga/dvi cable is secure and that your gpu is properly seated furthermore how did you &quot;dust&quot;, please tell me compressed air and not an actual duster orna vacuum. 
it takes only a small barely noticable static transfer to wipe your bios, fry yourr mobo, ram, or anything else. 
please start your pc and listen for any beeps, record any and if the are long or short. 
also, please inform us of your dusting method. 
if there are no codes and its appearing to post with no video check your display cable
