sorry but i might have a gremlin. 
no matter which graphics card is inserted and functioning correctly, when i insert the second graphics card and boot up, i hear the correct single beep from post but neither screen will light up with a display and allow me into xp where i should be able to get things correct. 
as a newbie, any help or ideas offered will be most welcome.
