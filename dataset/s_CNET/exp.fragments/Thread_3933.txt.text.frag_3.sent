minor detective work , i would see what defacing the solder pads look like and match them. 
use a magnifying glass and notice the solder pattern, because they would fit. 
however, how you solder it back is another issue. the proper tech way is find pin 1 of solder area, it may have the #1 to id it and the chip has a #1 or indent, dot, hollow or/on chip form, then match and resolder. 
because, this is smc stuff, it can be hard to do w/o proper tools, so you're left at the mercy of your skills.
