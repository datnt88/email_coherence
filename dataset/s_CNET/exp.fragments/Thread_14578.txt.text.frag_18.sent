...thanks to a friend. 
in bcase anyone else has the same problem: it was pretty straightforward, as it turned out -- perhaps something i missed in the seagate instruction manual. 
- went into the bios - went into drive configuration - selected primary slave - reset from off to auto - rebooted - drive was now set to ultra dma thanks to everyone who offered help.
