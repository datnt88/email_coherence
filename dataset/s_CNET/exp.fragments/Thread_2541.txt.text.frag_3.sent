thanks for your reply. 
i'm from montana, and am busy raising lean angus beef and us #1 hard red springwheat to keep all you us citizens healthy with sharp minds, so i greatly appreciate your helping me.found a d-link di-624 router and dwl-g520 adapter that i think will work, or the dwl-g620 (faster). 
i read some feedback that said the adapter was a pain to install, so go with dwl-g122 usb adapter, but taking that advice with a grain of salt, can't be that tough can it? 
i have a system with windows 98se and a new dell with xp pro that i want to network. the adapter will go in xp system. 
what is your take on this hardware?
