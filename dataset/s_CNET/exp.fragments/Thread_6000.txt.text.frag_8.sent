i now know that i do have a pci slot and not an agp slot. 
what is a good video card for me if i want good resolution for my new lcd screen. 
i am not into the heavy duty games such as half life or doom. the most i am into is looking at photograph i have taken. 
i have been reading the reviews on newegg and someone mention about making sure the pci is 64 bit and not 32. what does that mean and how can i figure it out on mine? 
can anyone recommend one. 
many thanks.
