recall the &quot;monolith&quot; in the movie 2001. 
well, that's a storage module of the most immense kind, and where was it put, the moon. 
it was &quot;earth's server&quot; so when activated it became alive with data. 
it could happen... anywhere data needs to be stored/saved and retrieved is a place it has to be found. 
ever since data has been gathered its been put somewhere and the &quot;media&quot; has changed but not the purpose. the retrieval for whatever reason suits some task or need. 
as they say, &quot;its not over until the fat lady sings&quot;. 
that means gathering so much data, you'll know when an ant farts. 
why, anyone would want to know, it yet another question.
