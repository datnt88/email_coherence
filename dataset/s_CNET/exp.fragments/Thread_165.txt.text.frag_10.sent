1. my first time to work on a laptop 2. the two hard drives mentioned in original post came from drivesolutions website (similar to crucials). 
3. now that i realize that they are dell drives i don't want them. 
4. i plan on purchasing a hitachi (hts541612j9atoo), 120gb 5400rpm 5. i plan on installing a retail version of xp with sp2 ( will later add sp3 from cdrom from ms that i also already have.). 
6. if i am forced to install win 7 there should be more than enough space. 
7. i will be bringing the ram up to the max for this computer which is 2gb 8. any thoughts or ideas from anyone will always be appreciated.
