been having this discussion since xp hit. 
256meg minimum for xp home, 512 for xp pro. 
according to all the graphs i have seen xp pro's performance peaks at between 310 and 320 meg of ram. 
save yourself some frustration and stuff as much ram as you can into your system. 
i am running 2megs of ddr2 and absolutely enjoy having ram to burn.
