it could be that some specific driver files for the card have become corrupted. 
i seem to remember something like that happening to a friend of mine, however, i can't quite remember how he resolved the issue. 
probably by removing/replacing the corrupted driver files and then re-installing the card. 
i also seem to remember something about video card and monitor conflicts...but in that case i don't think the card would've worked at all.
