having read the other replies, i will offer my humble opinion. 
you get what you pay for. 
i will use only hp printers and ink. 
i think that if you're only printing letters/documents and using black ink, it most likely wouldn't make musch of a difference. 
however,for photos or professional looking presentations, brochures, decals, tee shirt transfers, or any of the other creative things you can do with your printer, i would want the highest quality printer ink. 
i save by resisting the tempation to print all of my photos (haha), and by setting my printer default to print on &quot;fast draft&quot; automatically (which uses less ink and is perfectly fine for documents and everyday stuff), and then choose the higher quality for printing photos or other things. 
i hope this helps.
