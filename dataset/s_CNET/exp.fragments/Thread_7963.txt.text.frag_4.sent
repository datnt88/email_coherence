well, that is an option, though i'm not sure if the canon warranty allows refund/exchange at all. 
in any case, the printer is not defective since it works in xp, so chances are any replacement would have the same problem. 
also, i don't live in the states, and over here the store that i got the printer from (harvey norman) has no policy of refunding sold items, so it's going to be hard to get anything from there. 
an exchange would likely have the same problems. 
nevertheless, thanks everyone for your prompt replies.
