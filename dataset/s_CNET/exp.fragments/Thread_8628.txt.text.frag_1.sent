i'll be up front, this is a question for homework help. 
i'm not asking for an answer (that'd be cheating), more like direction to where i can find an answer (or if i'm on the right track with my hunch). 
i want to create a website but only allow a certain user or group of users access to that website. 
assuming that user or users will be from the same location, and likely the same static ip, can i throw a firewall between my internet connection and web server and only allow that specific ip address access to my web server by a rule? 
if there is a better way to handle that, i'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction. 
thanks!
