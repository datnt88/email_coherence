have you ever used a dell? 
if so then disregard this, but from my experience dells are substandard period. 
if its not 1 thing its another. 
the way they organize & simply operate just doesnt work well for my taste. 
i do everything on a computer, from word to music, to web design, surfing, downloading, etc, & dells just seem to get in my way. 
go w/ the apple.
