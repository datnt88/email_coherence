i have a sony vaio desktop (rcx5550) computer running windows xp with an internal cd drive and an internal cdr drive.yesterday 
i went to open the cdr and it wouldn't open. 
i then clicked on my computer to open it that way and it didn't exist anymore under the drives listed. 
what could have happened that deleted it from the system? the cd drive is fine(e:)but the cdr is nowhere to be found. 
i had system restore turned off so i can't try that method. 
any ideas ?
