sorry, i was opening up my computer and then clicking on properties but now i have found it (long time since i was into it and totally forgot how to find it as well as the bios) thanks. 
under the hardware tab i found the following: hl-dt-st cd-rom gcr-8480b and hl-dt-st dvdrrw gsa-2166d usb device is this what you were referring to? 
when i click on them both say they are working properly. 
i was wondering if i unplug it and plug it back in if that would help? 
i have a hunch i will have to take it in. 
i presume then the computer will also have to go. 
thanks helen
