thankyou very much for your fast reply, sir! 
i never used fiber insulators on the mounting posts before, but i am certainly willing to give it a go - sounds like a good idea. 
btw - when working on my problem, i could hear the sound of a loose screw when tilting the cabinet. 
could the loose scew be the cause of my problems?
