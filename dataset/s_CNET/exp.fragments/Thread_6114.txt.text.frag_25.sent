&quot;nothing can protect you from everything, but this combination is the best i have found out there.&quot; thanks, superhifi, for restoring perspective. 
i have to admit that, in his obsession, bob p. may have a point, given ongoing revelations re the washington mob's nefarious deployments of nsa, fbi, dod and who knows what else. sadly, however, bob's point is irrelevant to the real discussion here. the only real solution to bob's concern won't be technological but rather political -- investigation, exposure, censure, impeachment, and/or conviction. 
such issues belong in some other forum, not this one. 
yet, well meant responses to bob only further encourage him. 
i found my way to this forum looking for means optimally to protect my system at reasonable cost -- while i try to get my job done. 
my first computer was an original ibm pc (no hard drive!). i belonged to three user groups and many sigs, talked the tech talk and did my own hardware/software upgrades and fixes. 
i survived many ms-dos versions plus win286 and 386 (aaarrrgh!), etc. now -- at 71 -- my priorities are quite different. 
i still work against tight deadlines with a hefty workload, but i now have a distinctly finite amount of time on this planet. 
hence, i'm urgently more interested in work product than in process. 
in this case, all i wanted to know was: a) what's the difference between stingray and the phantom products?; and b) what hands-on, real-world experience does anyone have using these products to prevent threats to their work? 
among you, despite the static, you gave me what i came here for. 
i'm grateful for your helpfulness. 
now i'll be calling phantom and will let you know my own experience with the product. 
good holidays, thomkil
