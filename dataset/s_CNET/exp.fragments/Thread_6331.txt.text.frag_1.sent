so i have a rather old ibm, its a pentium 4 (2.4 ghz) netvista 8307. 
it runs well, i have lots of ram (1.5gb) but i was thinking about putting in a new video card. 
as i understand though, these things have to be compatible with the motherboard. 
could any let me know if some of the newer nvidia 8 series cards would be compatible. 
i found a review of the netvista here on cnet and in the specifications under &quot;free expansion slots&quot; i found 3 ( 3 ) x pci - three-quarter-length, 1 ( 1 ) x agp 4x - three-quarter-length i'm note sure what this means. 
i realize older video cards used agp system and that newer ones use pci. 
i believe the nvidia 8 series is pci x16. 
long story short, nvidia 8 series card for ibm p4 (2.4ghz) netvista, possible?
