thank you willy. 
im planning on spending 6000 to 8000 on a high end gaming computer so i just wanted to make sure the company i go with has good technical support (at least enough to act like they care). 
falcon northwest from what i have read has excellent customer service. 
i'm not in it for just the cool case but if i spend this much on a computer i figure i should get what i want. 
thank you for your help!
