i recently received two, ecs goal3+ mobo w/cpu (amd sempron 3000+). 
i set them up following step by step procedure for bench checking... the first mobo works fine. the second, the cpu fan starts but nothing else. 
i used the same power supply, memory, keyboard, monitor, and mouse in each mobo. 
why did the second fail to function correctly? is it a bad cpu? or could the cmos battery be bad on the second mobo?
