the first thing i would have performed on this machine would have been way more ram. 
windows xp doesn't even begin to work faster until you are over 512mb. 
especially if your using onboard video. 
i would recommend 1gb for systems with onboard video. 
you were severely limited with the earlier versions of windows 95 and 98, millenium,etc. 
they would become unstable over 512mb. 
there was a trick you could do to run 1gb of memory with those os's but it was a little complicated. 
anyway i got off the point. 
more ram is what you need to start with then go with tweaks. 
last but not least do you ever want to just start deleting and shutting things down. 
also sp2 will not slow things down but only help your os by fixing the many bugs the original os had so i can not see running anything but the latest version of the xp os. more ram is the secret engine to this crisis. 
also, now that you have messed with alot of the settings and processes i would also reinstall with a clean os again with more ram. 
i find it hard to believe that your bios on that mb doesn't have any settings for allotted ram to your onboard video too. 
most tech's suggest only setting that to 4mb as this is plenty to use on anything other than for gaming or photography. 
please look again at your bios and i am sure it is there. 
and lastly go to the mb manufacturers website and download the latest 4 in 1 via drivers and install them right after you get through reinstalling windows. 
also check for the drivers for onboard video, sound, lan,and usb (but be careful with usb because alot of these are for windows millenium, 98, 2000, only). 
just read it carefully because it may tell you you do not need the usb download with xp and newer. 
ok, i wish you luck and again more ram.
