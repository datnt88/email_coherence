&quot;think power. 
remember that 2.4gbz is that same frequency range as your microwave oven. 
now a little issue of how to double the coverage of a radio signal. 
you need 4 times the power for each doubling of the distance. 
starting at only 200 milliwatts for your best wifi wireless access point (wap) as a baseline, we can figure what it takes to reach out to you at 100 miles away. 
let's peg that full speed 802.11a at 11 megabits to work super at 41.25 feet and see what watts we need at 1 mile?

threads 2 = 25.6 watts end bpbasic now if we want to go from 1 mile to 20 miles we just keep going. 2 miles = 51.2 watts 4 miles = 102.4 
watts 8 miles = 204.8 
watts 16 miles = 409.6 
watts 32 miles = 819.2 
watts yes, we have about the power of your average household microwave oven at 20 miles. 
not only do we need this much power in the wap, but about that much in you lap pc-card. 
looks like wifi in your card will have some problems. 
bob&quot; --------- in addition -------- numerous other issues creep in such as a reflection off some mountain will duplicate the signal, but slightly out of phase and effectively scramble your reception. 
all the same issues that cell phone network builders become lots of fun. 
--------- the bottom line ----- you won't be doing this. the band in question is shared by all. 
you would be wiping all others off the airspace and someone would be hunting you down.
