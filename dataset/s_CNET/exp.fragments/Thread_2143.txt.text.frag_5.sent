you need to tear down as robert explained and now t/s the setup. the case is now out of the picture with the cardboard setup. 
further, you reduce connected items to make the simplest system, so all those usb devices, not needed for now other than mouse&kybd. 
if so equipped. 
take it from there and check it out. 
if after all this and it still doesn't work, then get a new mtrbd.. however, verify that all connections are proper to include trying a different psu. 
verify the video connection for power at mtrbd. is ok. the p4(?) connection, check wiring. 
with reduced setup you could use the old psu to test. 
you also mentioned that a ram stick was askew, you do know that may cause that bank of ram to be held down as bad or minor boo-boo but the effect is no video because it is such a low level of booting-up it causes it to have no display. 
you may want to simply wait for 5-10min. 
and see if it displays anything as it tries to negotiate pass an error condition. 
why, because the bios maybe setup to &quot;stop on any error&quot;, but its too late to change because no display. 
you could try resetting the bios to &quot;defaults&quot; using the clear cmos pins.
