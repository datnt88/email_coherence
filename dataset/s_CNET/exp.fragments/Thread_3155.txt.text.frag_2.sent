years ago the discussion began about multiple cores and to this day i smile as while the discussions raged on i had my dual pentium pro with the overdrive package. 
i got to see and feel the benefit for years while folk, right or wrong (remember i was already there) debated if more than one was needed. 
today you can see more debate and i'll smile as i rev up handbrake and see if use every cpu core and i'm done while those that went with less pull up such articles to prove they made the right choice. 
remember, i'm already there so in my rear view mirror i wonder what all the fuss is about. 
here's my latest i7 build favorite link: so with that out of the way, is your view from hindsight or guessing what's next?
