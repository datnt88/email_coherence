as far as your os is concerned, you'll only have 1 hard drive attached. 
the biggest downside is reduced reliability (a 2 drive stripe-set is twice as likely to fail as a single drive). 
you'll also lose smart monitoring capability at the os level unless your raid controller provides monitoring software. 
you'll need to do some research and determine the optimum chunk size for your controller and disk combination. 
generally its 32k (with 4k ntfs clusters) but some controllers differ. 
once set, you typically can't change it without reinitializing the array and the wrong setting can hinder performance. 
raid 0 can also sometimes increase your disk access time on 'dumb' controllers and thus decrease performance. 
lastly, some manufacturers (like western digital) offer drives fine-tuned for raid use. 
check them out and see if they're worth the premium.
