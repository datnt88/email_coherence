define generic printer ink. the ink sold to be used in all printers should be avoided. 
but if you buy bulk ink intended for your printer from a reliable vender that also has good suppurt such as then you should be okay. 
i have refilled my canon ink jet cartridges so many times i've lost count. 
you have to be willing to learn how to refill the cartidges. 
once you leara how you should have no problems. 
my epson printer has cartridges that require a device to reset factory cartridges and the cartridges are designed in such a way that the ink takes about 24 hours to work. 
this is where a vendor with good support helps. 
follow the directions from the vendor methodically. 
cover the work area with lot of newspaper, have paper towels, etc. available. 
refill the cartridges before they go dry. 
i keep a set of full cartridges ready to put into my printer and then refill the ones i take out immediately. 
i get great results and beautiful photo prints. 
i could not afford to make aa many photos if i had to pay for the printer company cartridges. 
printer are fairly inexpensive because the companies know they'll make huge printer with their cartridges.
