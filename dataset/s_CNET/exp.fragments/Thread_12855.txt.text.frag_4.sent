in a nutshell - front of the room, near (but not in!) a corner or wall. 
not-so-nutshell - if you have enough cable, place the sub where you would normally listen. 
play something with at least somewhat musical bass. 
walk around near the front of the room slowly, listening to the changes in the quality of the bass - bass frequencies/waves are long, as such very dependant on room shape, size and location within that space- it'll sound different at point a than it will at point b, even if they're only a foot apart. 
so, on your walkabout, you'll find a place where it sounds best - good oomph, but not too bloated and boomy - that's where you want to put the sub. 
again, pay particular attention to the areas to the front of the room, near a corner or wall, but never up against one. 
also, never put a sub at the halfway point between opposite walls - the waves will reflect and tend cancel each other out. 
after you get the sub placed, fiddle with the sub volume 'til it matches what's coming out of the l&r speakers (the z-2300 has a bass volume knob in addition to the master volume on the wired control). 
if you really want to get the most out of them (hehhehheh) go to radioshack and get a $30 sound pressure level (spl) meter and a test disc and balance along the frequency range to your heart's content!
