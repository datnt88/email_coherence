if you really just want a cheap router, you can find then for close to nothing online or when you ask around, post a note at the supermarket, etc. people get new routers when they move or get a new internet connection, or when they change providers, etc. i used a wireless router that i rescued from the dumpster when my grandma died and the (rented) house had to be cleared out. 
i used it as a 'bridged' router for some time, so i had wifi in the garage and garden.
