as far as i know, all crt monitor vga cables are the same, but most of them are 'captive' at the monitor end which means a damaged one can't be replaced as a diy job - that also means you'll have a hard time finding a replacement cable since there's no demand for them. 
if your cable uplugs at the monitor end then you're lucky, but otherwise it's a job for a qualified person.
