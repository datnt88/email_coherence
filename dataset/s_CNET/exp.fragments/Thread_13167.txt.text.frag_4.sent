&quot;&gt;how we will programmatically get the information of the bandwidth of &gt;an access point. 
&gt;otherwards how we will keep track of the bandwidth strength of an &gt;access point. 
if the access point supports snmp, then mrtg, rrdtool, or a wide variety of snmp based utilities will draw nice looking graphs. 
however, if your access point does not support snmp, then you can build a scripting tool that will extract the same information from a web page. 
for example, this java program will extract the numbers from a wgt624. 
as always, it would be nice to know what you are trying to accomplish and what you have to work with.
