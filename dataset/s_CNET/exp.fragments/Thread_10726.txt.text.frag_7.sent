they can both be on the network just fine. 
it's just that they won't openly display their presence as stand alone devices as other pcs can be made to do. 
lacie already says that modifications to the nas void the warranty. 
i'm sure that if i could figure a way to change the configuration outside of what the shell and browser offer lacie won't offer support. 
this isn't the end of the world. 
i can make it work just fine for me but those who will use it have grown accustomed to simply browsing for what they want and not playing hide and seek. 
thanks.
