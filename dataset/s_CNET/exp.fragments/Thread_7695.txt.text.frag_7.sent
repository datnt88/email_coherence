as a rule i'll stick to the short answer. 
there is no reason for me to duplicate web content on comparing a p3 to a p4 cpu. 
that's been done, overdone and then done again. 
it's quite simple as to which one will be the winner. 
i can only hope you'll skip the fx5xxx line in favor for any fx6xxx model.
