was talking with a friend and he said something about only needing drivers if i wanted a raid configuration. 
since this hd will be stand alone im not gonna need a raid setup. 
he also said the hd needeto be detected in the bios, which was my original problem. 
i cant seem to get it to it to autodetect and i cant put it in manually either. 
anyway thnx for the help and any more info is very much appreciated.
