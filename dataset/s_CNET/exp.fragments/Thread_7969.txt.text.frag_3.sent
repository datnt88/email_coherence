i've tried just about everything now. 
tried using the router as just an access point to no avail. 
i uninstalled everything and started from scratch. 
ended up back at the same place. 
everything's networked, just can't get to the internet on the client computers. 
made sure all the router info was correct, made sure internet connection sharing was on and turned off every firewall i could find. 
all gateways seem to be working, just not the internet. 
i'm just stumped!
