greetings. for over a year, i have been using dual evga 9800gts's in sli mode. 
even tried 3 at one time, did not do much to improve anything. 
i just removed the 9800's and installed daul evga 250gt's with 1gig ram each. 
in boarderlands now running the 250's, i am seeing some latency that was not there with the 9800's! 
i was under the assumption that the 250's were a step up from the 9800's which only have 512m each. 
please advise. 
thanks.
