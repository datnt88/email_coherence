nice dude. 
i think 10k is a little much at this point. 
i can spend 3500-4500. 
keep the suggestions coming, extremely helpfull. 
i like the fatal1ty from abit, think i will go with that. 
i've been a maximum pc fan / boot reader for sometime and seem to be in love with it. 
i'm not much of a gamer at this point, but i know i will be when i get the system. 
are the vid cards dual slot? 
if so, is dual pcie needed or even available at this point?
