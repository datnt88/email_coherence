reason: 1. ntfs: - file security - stability: one program dies, others still alive - more efficiency disk usages 2. at least 03 partions: - less risk: if windows crack (c), still have a chance to recovery data on other partion (d). 
- defragment much more easy. 
- have one drive for other experiment (example drive e to install a dual os - linux, xp media....) also i would make drive c (os system) at least 15-20gb since all your temporary files (internet....) will be stored in c) there are more reasons that should go for ntfs. 
do google search for more.
