been getting this error message for a while now - at first i put it down to dirty or scratched cd's, however i now notice that it is also giving the same response to my e drive (both asus drives, one dvd rom, one cd rw) and also to my floppy a drive. 
to my knowlede the only recent update to my computer is the upgrading to the latest norton systemworks. 
very annoying so any help will be greatly appreciated.
