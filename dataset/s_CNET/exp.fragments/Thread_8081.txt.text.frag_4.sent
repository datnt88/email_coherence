yes i have decided to keep the widescreen now that i was able to make the custom resolution and therefore make my icons and text bigger. 
i think widescreen monitors are indeed the future, but it would be nice if video card manufacturers made drivers that supported standard resolution sizes i listed in a previous post in this thread. 
with my 256 mb nvidia geforce fx 5700le, the only one listed was 1440x900, but once i found out how to make custom resolutions, 1280x800 looked much better.
