i was sharing my &quot;story&quot;. 
in the case when i tossed the bjc1500 the set of inks was going to cost me 99 bucks. 
the new epson was $120 and less with rebate. 
so i went back to the epson. the canon was 2 years old and the epson compared to the 2 year old printer has better output. 
both printers are very nice.
