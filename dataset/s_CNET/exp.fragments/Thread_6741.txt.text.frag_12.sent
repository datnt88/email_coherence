here is my ignorance talking, but is there a way to manualy set the master browser? 
my personal computer that is on the network is usually the first one to be turned on in the morning and off at night. 
if i can set that, it would be perfect for it. 
if not, is there anything else that i can do? 
i really, really do *need* this network set up and running.
