well i think ill drop the quad and take up the core 2 duo and keep the 4gig ram. 
i'm planing to use vista 64bit(since i'll be on 4gig ram) and i already own a xp licence, so i shall use both. 
anyway, like i said, i want a mobo to last at least 1 year and also play games on medium/high settings xcept for crysis of course). the reason why im opting for the striker 2 is for me t be able to upgrade when more demanding games come out. 
also, is a 8800gt 512mb enough to play cod 4 at high settings. 
ive already bought the card, so there is no reverting back as far as graphics is concern. 
n i'll be playing on a 22&quot; monitor. 
so, is it enough??
