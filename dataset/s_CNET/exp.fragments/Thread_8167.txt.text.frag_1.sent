windows xp tower - fairly standard set up intel piii 350 - 512 mg ram - nothing connected to it at all. 
i ruled out everything one by one - not even a keyboard mouse or monitor now - no other external devices. 
turn it on - wait for a about 30 secs - 1 minute - it just powers down - no warning at all. 
any ideas ?? not a virus - dont get time to load os yet alone a virus. 
cant get into bios - no time before it shuts down ! 
i've checked power lead, power fan - cpu heatsink and fan - all seem fine. 
never seen anything like it before ! 
hopefully one of you lot have. 
thanks, kd
