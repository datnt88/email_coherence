you say that running disk first aid from the installation disk did not indicate that there were any problems with the disk. 
as you only have 512mb of ram, the minimum for that machine when it was first released, there is not an easy way to check for a faulty sodimm. 
unless you have a software utility that does that for you. 
so, the next step is probably an archive and install. 
boot from the installation disk and choose archive and install from one of the very early options. 
this is preserve your data and put a new system down on the disk. 
on completion, it will put your data back where it should be. 
do not proceed with the installation unless you have chosen archive and install. 
failure to do so will result in all your data being deleted.
