did this just start happeing? 
did anything change (new modem?) have you been the modem's manufacture website and see what they have to offer? 
what sites are you trying to go to ? 
yahoo.com 
google.com 
cnet.com? 
if the page doesn't come up can you ping it. 
you have to go to a dos prompt and type ping yahoo.com 
sense if a response is sent back.
