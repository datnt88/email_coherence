best to use cable select. 
otherwise wd drives use no jumper for a master when there is no slave on the same ide cable, but gets jumpered for a master when there is a slave on the same ide cable. 
don't get cofused by the fact that in order to have a jumper available, they put the jumoer horizontally for the no jumper position simply for storage. 
you should have the 80 conductor ide cables for those drives. 
they are wired for cable select, best to use it.
