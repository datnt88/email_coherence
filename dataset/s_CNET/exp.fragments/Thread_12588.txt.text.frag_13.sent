vapcmd ya - that explanation does help for sure. 
thanks and i confess that no i haven't tested it with anything. 
i do hang around in some some programming chat rooms - with people who normally can answer questions like this - and surprisingly wasn't able to get any recommendations on this issue. 
well at least it surprised me. 
but i will be doing that today. 
its just that the behavior i've been getting appears to be a classic symptoms of bad ram - programs regularly just terminating with no error, windows giving me low memory warnings every 10 minutes, etc. fortunately this normally takes about 2 hours to start, so possibly its a heat issue too. 
but when it boils down to it, the crucial wizard at newegg did suggest a $25 2 chip pack for my laptop, something that seems like a real low risk to me.
