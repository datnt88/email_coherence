i'm curious if a gigabyte ga-ep45-ud3p lga 775 intel p45 atx intel motherboard would be compatible with an intel xeon x3370 yorkfield 3.0ghz 12mb l2 cache lga 775 95w quad-core server processor. 
i have researched their fsbs and they can run at a frequency of 1333mhz. the motherboard has others it can at it's max is 1333mhz and is the same rate as the xeons frequency, also the motherboard can run quad-core chip sets. the lga is the same as already indicated. 
i'm positive even though the cpu is a server cpu type that it will fit and run on a desktop motherboard. 
i'm i correct or is this impossible?
