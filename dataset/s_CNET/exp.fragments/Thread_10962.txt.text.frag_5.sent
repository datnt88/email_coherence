going on with my sons' computer that may cause some lag. 
today i cut down on the startup programs through msconfig. 
i'll see how that works and cut more if it helps. 
they won't like it but the parental controls (macafee) stays on. 
i don't think the lag should be the router/wireless usb as they are capable of 108 mbps which is almost twenty times the broadband connection rate (6 mbps) which should cover the bandwidth consumption between multiple computers in-house, encryption, etc. computer memory may make some difference as their computer has 784 mb of ram along with a geforce 5500 with 256 mb onboard. 
cpu is 1.4 ghz which should be fine for wow. 
i'll see how the startup config works before looking at more memory. 
by the way, i decided to go hardwire on the xbox setup. 
for about $10 bucks i picked up two cat5e female connectors, cable, wall outlet boxes and faceplates. 
i am simply going to wire from the office through the wall to the game room and connect via cable. 
already have the junction cable put together and tested. 
tomorrow i'll install the outlets in the wall for the cable hookup. 
thanks for your help.
