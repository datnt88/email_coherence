hello there, you guys might remember me from a while back, with the external hard drive issue. 
you wont believe my luck but now my sony laptop harddrive (60gig) has failed. 
i was using it the other day and it decided it froze and a blue screen came up saying that there could be dataloss and restart your machine. 
kept restarting and it kept happening. 
i then tried to use the recovery disks to format the drive, no go. the reformat process reached 3% then just froze. 
i'm pretty sure it's a physicla failure. 
it's weird though because i did a total reformat 3 days before this happened, was running a clean system. 
and it was only a year old, as my previous hard drive failed a year after i got the computer. 
lucickly i use retrospect to backup every few months (because of my slow dvd burner), so i wont have lost that much information except for all my emails... before the hard drive crashed, i used the external hard drive (when it was working) to create a backup of my most important files (including emails etc), so i could then copy all my important files over after i reformatted the machine this time. 
lastnight while attempting to access the hard drive in another desktop system, it worked for about 3 minutes then made a strange noise and it froze the machine i was working on. 
i then restarted the machine, and it came up with a scan disk checking all the chkdsk etc. it said it had unreadable sectors. 
does anyone know the chances of recovering this data, i am going to send it through to because its a western digital hard drive still under warranty and i dont want to void it. 
also i am not sure of the cost, has anyone used a data recovery service before? 
i am also going to run the western digital data diagnostic tools on their website. 
anyone has any hints or tips in this situation? 
thanks rossco
