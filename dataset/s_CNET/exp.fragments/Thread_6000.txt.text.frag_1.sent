i just bought a sceptre 19&quot; komono lcd monitor from ubid.com. 
i notice that there is a difference in sharpness from my old crt. 
its seems that this is not as crisp and the words and graphics seems a little fuzzy. 
i wanted to know if this is the norm. 
am i suppose to trade the sharp resolution of a crt for a thinner and lighter lcd that does not produce a sharp pic. 
pleaselet me know before i return this as this is the first lcd i've had. 
thanks.
