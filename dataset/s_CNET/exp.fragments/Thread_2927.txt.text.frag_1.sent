we have a d-link wireless 11n router. 
we use it very successfully with an acer win7 wireless 11n laptop, and we now have a 2wire brand 11b wireless ethernet adapter (to connect a bluray player to the network, but not yet installed). 
will the addition of the 11b device slow down the speed of the separate 11n connection. 
...just a general question about mixing 11x devices on an 11n router. 
if i have to get model numbers i can do so. 
(actually, this question is for a neighbor.)
