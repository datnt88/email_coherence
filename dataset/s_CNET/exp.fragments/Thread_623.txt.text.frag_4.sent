most of the enclosures say they support up to 1 tb, or up to 1.5 tb. was that only because that was the largest hard drives available at the time they tested it, or will it actually not support hdds larger than that? 
i don't want to have to get a new enclosure later when it comes time to get a 2tb, 2.5tb, 3tb, etc hdd. 
i've narrowed down my choice of enclosures to this one . 
it's a usb 2.0 & esata enclosure with good ventilation, a fan, and is on sale until wednesday (4-29) for $30 (normally $50). 
if i miss out on that deal, i'd be looking at either these two esata + usb 2.0 or this usb 2.0 enclosure. 
as for the two with esata, they don't come with the esata bracket, so i'd be looking at getting one of these or these . 
i've decided not to get a separate add-on controller card at this time, as it appears that my mobo supports hot swap sata. 
as for the hard drive itself... i'm thinking that this western digital wd1001fals - $105 would be fine, or do you think this wd wd10eads - $95 is good enough?
