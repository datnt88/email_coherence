make certain you have an amount above the minimum requirements. 
doubling the minimum ram is not a bad idea. 
next, identify what programs/services are loading at startup. 
determine which ones are necessary and disable the rest i can't provide specifics here. 
you also did not provide your pcs specifications or os. that would help. 
if your pc has on board video, you may be able to scale the shared ram to free some for applications. 
yes, there are many memory management programs out there. 
some are free and some cost money. 
these tend to add their own overhead as far as ram use. 
hope this helps.
