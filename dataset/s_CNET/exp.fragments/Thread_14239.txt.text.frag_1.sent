i recently burned all of my osx and os9.2 split hard drives to cd's as a backup. 
at the time i did not have an external hard drive. 
(was in transit.) now, after downloading the entire hard drive disks (after a clean-install) all folders are locked. 
it has taken me well over two hours to unlock all folders, sub folders and sub-sub folders. 
wonder why this happened?? any one else had this happen to them before? 
strange!? -kevin
