i just purchased a epson stylus photo r320 printer. 
followed all the instructions when loading the software. 
when i connect the cable into the usb port i get the following error message. 
&quot;cmdnist has caused an error in krnl386.exe 
cmdnist will now close. 
if you continue to experience problems, try restarting your computer.&quot; 
i have restarted my computer and no luck. 
i am running windowsme on a gateway. 
any help would be greatly appreciated.
