yep. and for darton fury. 
roughly data is built and transferred from one computer to another as in stages 1 to 4 and rebuilt 4 to 1. 1. segment - 'tcp + data' 2. packet - 'ip + tcp + data' 3. frame - 'lh + ip + tcp + data + lt' 4. transmit bits. 
( stuff/electrical signal transferred over the ethernet cable) tcp = tcp information ip = ip related information (ip addresss) lh = link header lt = link trailer lh and lt refer to data link layer header and trailer (mac info) source of reference - ccna intro by wendell odom - cisco press (ccie no. 1624) page 30. 
tcp /ip is a very large concept in itself. 
different components play a different role for supporting and maintaining connectivity. 
arp is a part of that but not relevant to the question asked. 
take care. 
both of you.
