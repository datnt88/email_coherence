thanks bob - i have several (all different) old pcs to upgrade but the one i'm working on at the moment is... pc - rm window box m/b - micro-star international. 
2003. 
sis 650gl-6a6ixm4lc-00 bios - phoenix award bios v6.00pg. 
uk date 29-01-2003 os - windows xp pro - service pack 3, fully updated. 
rm usually customise their award bios's have located the hdd you recommended for around 35 (uk) but i'm guessing that neither of my pcs will recognise them. 
somebody must have a way of finding the max size for each machine. 
my dell is only 2006 but can't read more than 160 gigs... sigh....! glad to see that you are using the same type of dyslectic keyboard as me - my .com 
always comes out as .ocm as well - but appart from that, they are good keyboards. 
-------------------------- thanks vapcmd the hdd controller you mention.. would that be a pci plug-in type...? seems like a good alternative. 
many thanks - mike
