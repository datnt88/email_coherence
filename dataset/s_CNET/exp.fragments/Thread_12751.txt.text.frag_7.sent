i try different wiring placement with temporary twist ties (like garbage bag wire ties) until i think i have the best placement, then use the nylon/plastic wire ties to tie up sets of wires, then tie them to each other or to hold them in place, sometimes a couple of them together pulling the wires towards a corner. 
using black ties hides them, colored ties are easier to find and remove. 
or just hide the computer inside another custom cabinet.
