hi karthik, how big of a hard drive are you hooking up to the old computer? 
some motherboards aren't capable of recognizing some of the larger sized hard drives. 
you will have to read your motherboard manual and find this out. 
in some cases, you will have to upgrade your bios in order for your motherboard to recognize the new drive. 
you're other option is to purchase an external hard drive and use it that way. 
hope this helps, howard
