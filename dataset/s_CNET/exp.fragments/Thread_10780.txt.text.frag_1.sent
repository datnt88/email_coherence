i am considering building a new computer for the first time. 
i have begun doing some research into it and would like to know: 1.) a good estimate of what building a moderate (2.0 ghz+, 40 gb, 512 ram, etc..) computer without including the cost of the monitor. 
2.) i would also like to know more about the amd sempron compared to athlon xp. which one is the better choice? 
compared to intel, are the amd chips a better deal for building moderate level computers? 
thank you for your help!
