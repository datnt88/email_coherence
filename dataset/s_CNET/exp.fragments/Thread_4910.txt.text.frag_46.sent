i have a gateway 5478 with the same symptoms. 
reboot every hour. 
i don't think matt is right about card jamming issue. 
card jamming, driving a heat-related reboot wouldn't be so predictable (every hour within a minute). 
another symptom to add to the mix: i just shut my computer down and tried to restart it just after it shut down. 
when i pushed the button to restart, the cpu fan went crazy like just before it restarts itself only this time the fan stayed on, but he machine didn't come on. 
cycling the start button got it back, but now it skipped the expected hourly restart (first hour).
