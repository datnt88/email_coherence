is that as time marches on, you find it's no longer true. 
back in the 90's i had dual cpu machines and enjoyed smooth operations and all the rhetoric back then was fun to read as i was there and enjoying the ride while others debated more than one cpu topics. 
today i have the quad core and it's very nice for the work that i do. 
i would not change back. 
today i'm &quot;there&quot; with windows 7 64 bit and not a single problem. 
again i see all those that claim there are problems yet most of them are not &quot;there.&quot; that is, they don't actually own, use or write software on such machines.
