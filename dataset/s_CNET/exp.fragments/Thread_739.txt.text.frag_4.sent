your combined posts led me to the answer. 
i almost gave up after talking to a hp tech and being told the old brio only support a hdd up to 13 gb. 
he said connecting a hdd over 31.5 gb would cause the pc to not boot at all, stall booting or freeze in the process. 
for me it would not boot at all, paused at the first hp logo screen then i read these two posts from you guys, remembered all the jumper settings on the hdd i had purchased, deskstar hitachi, did a bit of research and bingo got the answer! 
to bad the hdd manual does not address the settings or provide any of this info. 
anyway, the hdd is working even though i only have use of and access to 31.5 gb. that's fine. 
and yes w2k is at sp4 level. 
thank you both very much!!
