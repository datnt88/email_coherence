hiya. i don't know if i can post links, but i was considering buying that. 
right now i have 250w. the couple things i'm curious about, is if that is a psu, 'cuz it seems very cheap (or maybe i'm underestimating them), and how i would install it, when in fact it does come (if that's just something that's on the dell manual, those things are really hard to read). 
i have a dell dimension e310. 
sorry if my question is jumbled, thank you in advance.
