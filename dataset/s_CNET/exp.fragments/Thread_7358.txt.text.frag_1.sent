i guess everyone knows about the soyo's rebate game that being they don't honor them. 
imo another rebate game is being played by corsair. 
they require a rebate be submitted within seven days. 
(i should have just ordered from newegg or zip-zoom-fly it would have been cheaper in the long run.) i hope microcenter will reconsider with whom they play. 
i encourage everyone to read the policy before thay leave the store.
