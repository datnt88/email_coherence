it doesn't matter if the projector is on or off. the reason i know is i turned on the computer, went off to do things, came back and the monitor wasn't up. 
i turned on the projector, and the computer was waiting for a respond for safe mode. 
i originally had the monitor connected with a hdmi and the projector with the vga. 
i thought maybe the vga loaded first and that was why the projector came up first. 
i changed the monitor to vga and got a dvi/vga adapter for the projector. 
that didn't change anything either. 
i have no problem switching the cables and will try that. 
what is the priority? 
dvi, vga, hdmi?
