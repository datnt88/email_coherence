advanced host controller interface (ahci) is an interface specification that allows the storage driver to enable advanced serial ata features such as native command queuing and hot plug. 
here's a secure cable: since you didn't add any drivers, maybe they're part of the mobo/chipset drivers. 
your mobo certainly supports hot plug (page 1-3 of your user's guide). 
anyhoo... i don't think you have anything to worry about.
