the netgear cg814wg is listed on netgear.com as a combination ''cable modem gateway'' and says you need to contact your isp for support. 
if your isp configured the cg814wg, they should have given you all the information you need to connect (ssid name, password, etc.). 
when you contacted your isp, what did they tell you when you asked them what the ''wap network id number'' is? 
if it is asking for a password when you try to connect, you should be able to learn what it is by going to the router's administration page. 
if this router was configured by your isp, they should be able to tell you the password without charging you.
