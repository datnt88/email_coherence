i have one machine that runs 24/7. 
it has zero shutdown on the drives because starting up and stopping is what wheres out the bearings--running them at even speed keeps things smooth. 
i have a crappy little laptop that is my fileserver. 
it's allowed to standby, shut down drives, sleep, whatever. 
it powers up a 250gb external drive when accessed, and that's where most of my machines back up to. 
that is also kept as an image on the 24/7 machine. 
and yes, if it's a choice between the computer and the aircon, the aircon wins, because i'm not burning out any more cpus!
