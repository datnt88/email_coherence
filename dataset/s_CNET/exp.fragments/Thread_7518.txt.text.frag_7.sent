is doing it again..and the ppl from wd do not reply.. i would consider order the dual input cable thingy.... i can not believe the service of wd... i hope that it would get fix again... (silly question but i`m starting to think that is related somehow: if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive?? i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought?? thx again..)
