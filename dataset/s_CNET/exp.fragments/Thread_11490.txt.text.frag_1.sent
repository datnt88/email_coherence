is there a pgm. 
or such that can &quot;soft boiler plate&quot; the flash drive. 
meaning, once accessed, a sign of the owner can be seen. 
something like ghost print over a letter size page showing its origin. 
it can be called a &quot;water mark&quot; sorta thing, i really can't explain it well. 
i hope i made sense. the display of say some picture is shown then in the backgrd. 
from xyz studio in very light display. 
i include any text display as well. 
its not part of the actual data, but the flash drive is giving its identity as in xyz studio. 
tia -----willy just wondering
