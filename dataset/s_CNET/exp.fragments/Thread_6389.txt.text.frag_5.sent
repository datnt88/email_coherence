you should try emptying out your trash, because if you have put files in the trash from your drive they still take up space. 
if that doesn't work you could maybe try and format your drive by going into applications&gt;utilities&gt;disk utility and formatting the device to mac os x extended (journaled) (or ms-dos if you are transferring files between your mac and a windows computer).
