there are six listed at a model number would be handy. 
as to formating in fat32, that's very odd. 1. why wasn't xp's drive management tool used? 
2. i strongly advice against fat32. 
here's why. 
chkdsk seems to not work on many (most or all?) usb 2.0 drives. 
fat32 will develop errors and you won't have a way to resolve them.
