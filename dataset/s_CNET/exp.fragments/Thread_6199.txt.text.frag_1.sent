i am running into an issue. 
2 computers, one is xp home, one is xp media center. 
both have file and print sharing turned on. 
firewalls turned off. 
both connect to the internet thru a telcom dsl router successfully. 
desktop is wired (xp home), laptop is wireless( media center) it has file sharing on the directory for testing and also sharing the printer. 
i can ping the ip going both ways. 
pinging 172.16.x.x. now a couple of things... laptop has a 172.16.x.x via ipconfig desktop has a ip of 192.168.x.x via ipconfig, however via the telcom's router it shows clients of 172.16.x.x. i am unable to connect to the shares on either the desktop or laptop. 
i can't net use to them either. 
i can't browse. 
any idea's?
