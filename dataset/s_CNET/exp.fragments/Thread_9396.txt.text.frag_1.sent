i have an old (4-6ish i think) dell desktop that i use mostly for messing around with various linux distributions (i use ubuntu normally). 
everything was working fine with a 1gb stick of ram (which i purchased as an upgrade) that had tested fine with memtest when i first put it in. 
i tried installing windows 7 public beta just as a test. the installation went fine, but then i was unable to boot the computer. 
i put in a linux live cd (i can't remember what distro) and restored grub so that i could boot the existing ubuntu installation. 
that too, though, didn't boot, so i put in an ubuntu live cd to reinstall. 
this is where things get weird. 
bits of the screen were blacked out and i could not click on anything. 
this reminded me of a memory error, so i tried memtest again. 
sure enough, it showed up with an error after a couple of passes. 
i then replaced the existing stick of ram with an identical piece (from the same kit) and tried memtest. 
it passed. 
then i tried to boot ubuntu again from the computer (it didn't boot) and then tried booting ubuntu from the live cd. 
once again, i got the black marks. 
i tried memtest and it now fails. 
in other words, the same stick of ram passed memtest before attempting to boot ubuntu/windows and then failed after. 
this was true of two sticks of ram. 
what is going on?
