the gfx card is compatible as i stated earlier. 
the ram, if its rambus and you bought the speed compatible with your computer and supported by dell, (rambus is usually generated for specific oem manufacturers) should work, if not return it. 
you power supply should be able to handle it as the fx5500 isn't a high-end card. 
consider upgrading your powersupply if the gfx card doesn't work, but i managed with a pentium iii, 256mb, dvd-rom,cd-rw&lt; 1 hard drive, and an ati 9200se with just 120watts, so yours should work. 
good luck!
