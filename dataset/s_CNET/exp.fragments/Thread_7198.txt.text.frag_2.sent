android tablets are still on the fiddly side so stick to those names. 
as to blu-ray quality that's an easy no. no 24p playback so it falters right at get go. 
we have a lot of tablets at the office but not the apple because of no serial port profile so our apps are not possible. 
it's a nice tablet. 
it's odd that the folk are not aware of sd card solutions if you want to carry stuff on that media. 
i own of of those kingston wifi 32gb cards so that's another way.
