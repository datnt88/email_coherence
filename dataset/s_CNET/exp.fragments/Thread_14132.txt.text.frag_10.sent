when you print does it come out properly even though the preview looks weird? 
can you print from other programs besides the web browser without a problem, what about print preview in other programs? 
i can't imagine any flat panel screen that is $300 and is very high quality, that's what you get at the rock bottom end of the flat panel pricing. 
that old notebook sounds dead, the display's commonly go out. 
there is little, if any difference between a flat panel display in a laptop and a good flat panel display for a desktop.
