it seems you carefully worded your post to leave out exactly what old system you have. 
apparently many a pre-installed os suggests an oem type install. 
if that's case the oem eula makes transfer to any non-oem brand system(still hard) outside of its intended usage. the other posters pretty much covered the topic. 
i just like to add, while you can get a &quot;generic oem&quot;(for new diy system) as your best bet to get your current swapped h/w plus any drivers required for that rebuild system. 
in other words, you see the problems with &quot;pirated&quot; os, the the same for old legit but non-original oem system is the same result. 
if you buy a retail version of xp(full/upgrade) you can install that on any 1 system and again, if that system fails on another system provided it remains on only 1 system. 
the generic oem version is likely the cheapest to get, though i exclude ebay and other sources.
