...that the lcd be at the native resolution and refresh rate at 60 hertz, when i press the button on the monitor that lets you change brightness, etc. i see that whenever i restart my computer, i see &quot;auto adjust in progress&quot;; then i see it again at the log-on screen. 
if i don't reset the settings to factory default after the log-on screen appears, text is coarse and blurry. 
but i don't want to have to reset all settings to factory default after every restart to get a clear picture. is there some way i can do this?
