i have problem on setup multiple displays. 
i using dvi(1meter) connect to my acerx203h and vga(1m) connect to my hdtv. it is able to display my screen. 
the problem is when i replace the vga(1m) to vga(10m) cable, then there is no more display on my hdtv. 
so i wonder whether is my vga(10m) have problem and i use it to connect between pc n my acer x203h. 
it have display but blur. then only i notice the length of vga cable will affect the display quality. 
but is this the reason my hdtv cant show? 
or other settings than i forgotten? 
because the problem is just between 1m vga cable and 10m vga cable..
