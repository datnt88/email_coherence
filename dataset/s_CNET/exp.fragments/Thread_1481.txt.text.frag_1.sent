hi everybody, i hope someone can help me with this problem,i bought the above hdd sometime ago on ebay. 
if stats are checked on this drive it should be 20gb capacity,but i have tried everthing i know (and all it reads in bios/or win98se is 10gb capacity. the things i have tried are 1.changed from auto to user setting in bios and put in all drive data,but wont accept it. 
2.used seagate tools and zero filled drive..then repartitioned(fdisk)and formatted drive to largest size and even seagate(manager)only sees drive as 10gb. 
as above drive is a (oem version)which i think was for compaq as it has a label on it saying(replace with compaq spare 192058 - 001)...i am beginning to wonder if it is possible the drive has somehow been altered, either by seagate themselves for compaq or compaq to 10gb. 
i would grateful to hear some of your opinions on the above,as i have found it impossible to get drive back to its original capacity of 20gb?? just for the record i got the drive for less than half price from ebay seller when i complained about it as he was selling as a 20gb. 
cheers, crowngreen2
