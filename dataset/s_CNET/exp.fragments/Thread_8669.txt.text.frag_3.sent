yep, logging on is already done with a username and password. 
thanks for the reply btw. 
i am totally stumped by this one; it's bizarre that my pc can see, and navigate the first couple of layers of the drive, but fails to access any further than that. 
i do not personally believe its a problem with access permission, but am open to *all* suggestions!
