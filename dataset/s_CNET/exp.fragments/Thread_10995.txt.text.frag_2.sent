in california there is a disposal fee if you don't find a free electronics recycling day. 
a refurbished p4 is under 99 bucks so it's value is negative which is why you find them on street corners, dumpsters and other places. 
do not upgrade the cpu. 
that one is already at or near the top of what the socket takes. 
you can find cpu benchmarks on the internet but it's not about the cpu most of the time. 
it's stability and for some, gaming. 
i would not invest a dime in such a find. 
even the case may be trouble but maybe you found a few good things to play with.
