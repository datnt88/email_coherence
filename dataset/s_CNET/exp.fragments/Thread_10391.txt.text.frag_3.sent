since the power cord plugs into the ptr. 
and not a ac power wart, then that suggests any power issues are within the ptr. 
as already stated to you, maybe a &quot;fuse&quot; has blown, check for that. 
otherwise, its a power ckt. 
item within the ptr. 
and you need repairs or order the ac assy. 
as a possible fix, if you deem that will do. 
if the ac cord itself is at fault, replace with a similar one, that should be a low cost item. 
i rarely find a bad ac cord, unless repeatedly stepped or mangled in some way. 
if no easy fix or repair, than a new ptr. 
should be considered.
