after a system crash, i decided i better get serious about backing up my computer (and my wife's, too). 
i have a pavillion a1210n with a 200gb sata-150 h/d and found that my motherboard had two sata-150 ports. 
but after buying a new internal h/d for backup, i realized i'd bought a sata ii drive (i.e., not compatible with the sata-150 motherboard ports) and i read on hp's website that my computer could only accommodate one internal h/d, not two (despite the two motherboard h/d ports). 
so i thought about buying a drive enclosure with a usb connection but i've heard that can be very slow, even for periodic backups. 
then i read about esata which is offered on some enclosures but you need a sata ii pci-express card (or a sata ii motherboard slot which i don't have). 
one enclosure offers both esata and usb so i could use it to back up my computer with esata and then use the usb for my wife's computer; she has less data so the slower connection wouldn't be a problem. 
i also found that apparently some of the sata ii pci cards limit transfer rates to far less than the 300mbps offered by my new drive. 
here are my questions: 1. is there any possibility of connecting the new sata ii drive inside my computer, despite the hp's owner's manual statement? 
and if i did, would i be able to use the second drive to back up my wife's computer over our network connection? 
2. if i instead buy a drive enclosure and a pci card, what should i look for in the product specs that will ensure that i get the fastest connection for backup? 
any specific product recommendations? 
and i see pci card prices that vary from $30 to $500...what's up with that? 
thanks for any help or suggestions you can offer.
