my friend has the exact same system as you and is looking to make the same 7600gt video upgrade as you. 
he is having some trouble finding a compatible psu. 
i have not been able to determine whether the psu has proprietary wiring/form factor or standard matx wiring/form factor. 
i searched online and have not been able to find a psu that is explicitly designated as a suitable replacement or upgrade. 
this leads me to believe that the psu may be proprietary. 
typically, there are many replacements available online (explicitly designating a compatibility list) if the wiring and form factor are standard. 
can you give an update on whether you found a suitable power supply for your netvista 8307?
