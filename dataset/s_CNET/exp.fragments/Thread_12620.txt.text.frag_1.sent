i just purchased a sony 710ul i have an hp laptop 2.3 p4 40 gig hard drive. 
i have an internal 4x burner but i wanted something faster. 
i have installed the drive but i am not getting any speed faster then what my internal drive was providing. 
i have updated the firmware from sony's website but i still have the same problems, any suggestions, is there something i can do to check and make sure my computer has what i need to support the drive?
