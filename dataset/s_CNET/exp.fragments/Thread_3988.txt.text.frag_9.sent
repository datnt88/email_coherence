i put a linux version on an older pc as a way for me to get a feel for it. the deeper i get the less i like what i find. 
anything linux seem to lead to out of step position in terms of game play. 
i have not given up on it but at this point i'm working through a 3 inch thick book on. 
i had some success with a live cd version but still don't have a comfort point with it. 
have you ever gone to linuxgames.com?
