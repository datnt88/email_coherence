ok, i'm on a computer at the library. 
because of loudness of my dell dimension 8200, i called dell about the problem. 
anyway, after some tests and unplugging fans and my hard drive, we came to the conclusion that we needed a new hd. 
anyway, dell is sending a new one, blah blah blah. the main concern is that now the hard drive doesn't work and i can't start-up the computer. 
i get an error like &quot;can't find hard drive (device 0). before, the hdd work perfectly other than the noise. 
i want to recover some of my files off the old hdd before i get the new one. 
dell was un-helpful. 
any suggestions. 
i've already tried un-plugging and re-plugging the hdd.
