hi all... my netgear rp614 v.2 router has begun &quot;disallowing&quot; certain sites to be accessed, with no changes or input from me. the biggest site in question is usps.com, which is a vital part of running my business. 
i can access the site with the router bypassed. 
i have upgraded the router's software, reset all defaults, adjusted mtu, etc., with no results. 
i spoke with netgear and they suggested that i will need to obtain the usps.com 
port number(s) and manually input them into the router. 
my question is how do i obtain such port numbers, and how do i input them into the router, &quot;forcing&quot; it to allow that site? 
any help would be very much appreciated!
