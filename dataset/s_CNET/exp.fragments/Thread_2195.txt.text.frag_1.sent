hi, i'm a college student and my roommate is bringing a lexmark x1185 (i know its a cheap printer). 
i would like to connect this printer to my wireless network or be able to connect to the printer through bluetooth. 
now, i know that this printer does not have these capabilities right out of the box, but is there some type of cheap adapter that i can buy for it to give it these capabilities? 
preferably i would like to keep the price below $30. thanks, d0lfan
