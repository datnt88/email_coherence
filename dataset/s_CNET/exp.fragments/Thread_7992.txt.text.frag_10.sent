first, dual monitor support is going to be limited to a handful of games. 
supreme commander comes to mind but even that game's developer says a wide-screen is more than sufficient. 
your 1k gbp budget is about $1980 usd so you can certainly get a pretty high-end kit if you're willing to build it yourself. 
(i'll be using usd estimates.) motherboard: asus p5b-e or gigabyte ga-965p-ds3/ds4, $150 processor: core 2 duo e6600, $320 ram: geil gx22gb6400udck ddr2-800 4-4-4-12 2gb kit, $230 graphics: evga or xfx geforce 8800gtx, $560 monitor: samsung 225bw 22&quot; widescreen lcd, $340 hard drive: 2, caviar re wd2500ys 250gb sata 3.0gbps drives, $160 dvd drive: lg, lite-on, sony, $40 case/ps: $65 for a name brand 450w power supply and $65 for your preferred case, $130 windows: vista premium oem, $120 total usd: $2050 these prices are without rebates and conservative estimates. 
i think you could shave at least $100 off by shopping around. 
you could also save $150 by going with an 8800gts ($300) since it can easily handle the 1680x1050 widescreen resolution. 
save another $80 by going with a samsung 20&quot; widescreen at the same resolution. 
one note on the hard drives. 
the asus mobo supports intel matrix raid so you can mix raid-0 (striping for speed) with raid-1 (mirroring for fault tolerance) on the same set of disks. 
dual 250gb drives could be configured as a mirrored 60gb c: drive and a striped 350gb d: drive.
