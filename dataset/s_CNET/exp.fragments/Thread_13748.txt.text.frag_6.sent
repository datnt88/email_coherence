you can set the resolution to what you like. 
but native is usually the best. 
what i did. 
i have a 19&quot; wide screen. 
i found a 22&quot; wide screen. 
when i got it home i found out that my intel graphics card supported about a gazillion resolutions. 
but not the one specific to the new 22&quot;. 
specifically, it supported resolutions above and below the new lcd, but not the exact one. 
bummer. 
i took it back.
