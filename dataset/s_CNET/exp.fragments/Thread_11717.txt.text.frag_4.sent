you didn't mention you had other laptops that didn't exhibit this issue. 
i could think you might have an antenna connection problem within the laptop. the wiring generally stretches from the pci board up into the display. 
this means it flexes when you open and close the laptop and these wires break. 
as well, sometimes the plug/jack connection on the wifi adapter isn't the greatest. 
since laptops move and flex, any mechanical connection can become intermittent. 
your moving the laptop could cause a momentary signal loss requiring it to reconnect. 
now, if your router is b/g, your laptop runs in one of these modes so &quot;a&quot; isn't in the picture.
