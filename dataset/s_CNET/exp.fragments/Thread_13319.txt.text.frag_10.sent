it seems like mother apple will sweep away all the windows microsoft programs with an osx tiger for all the windows fans.......we all know how many holes, worms, viruses, etc. windows has......microsoft better worry that apple will enter into their territory with a superior operating system without any of the problems windows offers.....it will not be just a hardware move, but a software move.....should be interesting to have osx being able to run on any intel based machine ....
