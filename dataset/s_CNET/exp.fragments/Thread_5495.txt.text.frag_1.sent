i'm not looking for speed. 
i'm looking for power and heat. 
65mm intel is generally better than 90mm prescott i've heard. 
i can keep my computer running cooler and quieter. 
but i can't decide between a pentium d915 and a p4 631. 
forget about speed and cache, etc. but the 915 is 95w and the other i found is 65w. 
i found a 65w version. is the 30 watt difference enough to make my pc hotter. 
or 65mm is better in general and watts don't matter. 
thanks, confusimo
