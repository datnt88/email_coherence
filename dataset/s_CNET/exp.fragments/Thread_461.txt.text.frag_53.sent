i had never heard of them until now. 
thanks for the heads up - they have toner carts for my okipage 6e! my little old slow-as-all-get-out 6e. i use it to print plain text pages (my scripts and research articles mostly). 
it still works great - as long as i'm not in a hurry. 
i've refilled the cart that's in it about 10 times. 
(spread out lots of newspaper, don't wear good clothes, etc.)it's time for a new cart and maybe a new drum. 
it's seen a lot of use. 
ah, they don't make 'em like they used to.
