hi r proffit, ok, i've tested the switch, thats fine. 
then i took mobo and psu out of case and tested it with just ram and cpu. 
this resulted in nothing, the fans would like rotate 2cm. then i removed everything so it was literally psu and motherboard. 
and just tested them on their own. 
still would not power up. the fans would spin for about a second and then i could smell a bad smell, but i could not identify it. 
i guess this narrows it down the motherboard or psu now. 
what do you think? 
and ideas?
