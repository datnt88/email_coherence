if you try and boot an xp hard disk that has been marked bad (xp seems to do this) it also for some unknown reason seems to mark the floppy, (or the bios) so that you cannot boot from the floppy. 
this has happen on three machines, including my test machine. 
i remove the floppy power connector, try to boot the machine, the machine informs me of floppy failure, i reconnect the floppy, boot the machine and it will then boot from the floppy.
