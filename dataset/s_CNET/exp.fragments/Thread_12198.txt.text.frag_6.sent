i just returned to the &lt; &gt; site to see if i could get a lesson running. 
i did. 
i downloaded the &quot;history of the internet&quot; topic and, within a few minutes, it was playing both the video and audio. the lessons are just about at the right level for this learner - abject beginner &lt;grin&gt;. 
thanks. 
i'll keep trying to view the rest. 
any more tips about other network (and even general computer)learning sites like this one? 
goood materials &lt;g&gt;.
