is getting bum raps. the hw bundled v7 plays bd fine and like later versions, only decodes stereo, not multichannel. 
for latter you have to pay. 
also trial versions cannot be patched with released fixes so evaluators are left wanting. 
v10 mark 2 has played new discs for me so far without hiccup. 
and don't forget to update reader firmware from mfr if you expect it to work for new discs.
