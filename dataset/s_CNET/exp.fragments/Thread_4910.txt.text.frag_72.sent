i found this very useful thread in a search on the gateway 5632 issues and problems. 
after reviewing all the threads i've found on various issues such as the dreaded gateway &quot;reboot/restart&quot; problems, the 1/16/08 schroeder town motherboard bios update seemed to be the final nut for the solution. 
i would love some feedback from the various gateway owners who have had these issues and have applied the latest gateway schroeder town bios update as a solution. 
have any issues returned? 
has the 1/16/08 bios update rectified all the problems with this speedy, yet problematic, system? 
thanks in advance.
