i haven't tried using different sizes but i'm just imagining that if one took a 22&quot; lcd and a 17&quot; lcd and had both plugged into the same video card, how would that work for anything trying to go &quot;full screen&quot; as it is no longer a simple rectangle. 
i was just taking a guess and never tried it myself, sorry.
