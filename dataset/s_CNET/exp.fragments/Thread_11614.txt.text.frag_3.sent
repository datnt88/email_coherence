hi toni, thanks for your reply. 
i'll try opening the case and check if there is something wrong or reseating rams. 
regarding that extension cord. 
its an extension cord with some sort of surge protection but with 2 pronged plug not that one with the ground pronged plug. 
it costs around us$ 5 in our country.
