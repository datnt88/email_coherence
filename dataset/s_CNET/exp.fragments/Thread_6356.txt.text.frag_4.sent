thanks for the reply 250 watts power supply is whats in the box. 
1. no spyware, i run the scan each reboots 2.the cover is not on cause i just replaced the mobo so i haven't had time to put the cover. 
there is no heat, i don't smell anything, both fan are running. 
3. i flashed my bios 30 minutes before this happened however i was able to boot up to windows after,that's where i moved a file to another partition and the computer rebooted i got back to windows and checked the event viewer to find out the harddisk0 crashed now i can't do anything, i am stuck with a flashing orange light monitor. 
4. i've installed all drivers for that mobo the day before. 
5. i've installed service pack 2 on it also. 
and to let you guys know i tried another graphic card in the board and my monitor still doesn't detect that one. 
but it works with my dell computer.
