i think bob read your post too fast. 
an internal disk is much more reliable than an external one. 
but still, it can go south. 
so you surely need a backup of everything you put on it. 
if it's a big hard disk full of stuff you don't want to lose, you need a big external disk (or a fast internet connection and a big enough web storage), or a second internal disk (preferably on another pc in your home network) or possibly a set of blue-ray dvd's for that backup. 
usb sticks or normal dvd's can't contain enough data. 
the advantage of an external disk is that you can store it elsewhere for added security against theft, fire and floods.
