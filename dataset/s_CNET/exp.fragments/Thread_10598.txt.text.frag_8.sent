well, after 2 and 1/2 hours on the phone with dell tech support (canada), the problem is finally solved. 
it wasn't working because of the way the devices were installed in the pci slots. the initial (bad) setup was: slot 1 ---&gt; d-link wifi card slot 2 ---&gt; firewire card slot 3 ---&gt; 56k modem after some mixing and matching, the configuration that finally worked was: slot 1 ---&gt; firewire card slot 2 ---&gt; empty slot 3 ---&gt; d-link wifi card i never use the 56k modem (who does?) so we got rid of that. 
we figure the modem had some kind of conflict with something else. 
before doing this, we updated the bios, chipset drivers and installed a patch from microsoft that had to with enabling 1394 enumeration. the system is a dell dimension 2400.
