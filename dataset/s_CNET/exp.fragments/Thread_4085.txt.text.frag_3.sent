quick check...review the manual/helpguide and verify the frt. 
panel power sw. is actaully on the right connection. 
usually a 2-pin connection it can mistaken or misunderstood labeling and thus &quot;no go&quot; when sw. is pushed. 
further, you can momentarily touch the pin contacts to act as sw. to see if starts then, bad sw. maybe or wrong connector used(remote?) as for fan twitch, a power surge can do that, a good quality p/s unit locks that down. 
good luck -----willy
