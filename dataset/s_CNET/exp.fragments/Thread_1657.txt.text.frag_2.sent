i did place a win2k drive from a tower machine into an external enclosure connected via usb and was actually able to boot from it. 
xp was able to see the drive. 
however, if all you wish to do is transfer a few files, it might be easier and cheaper to just temporarily connect the drive to an internal ide port. the only risk here is that xp will see the hardware change and put one checkmark against your quota before reactivation is needed.
