my computer makes clicking sounds as if i were mousing around and opening pages, etc -- except it does it all the time, even when no one is at the computer. 
i think it's related to some antivirus etc. apps i just installed. 
my question is, how do i get this sound to turn off? the clicks are creepy and annoying, and they come through loud and clear when i'm listening to music on rhapsody or something. 
i just want them to go away... all the posts i can find about clicking noise seem to be about a dying hard drive, which this isn't. the sound comes through the speakers and similar to the sound the mouse makes when you click it. 
it clicked 4 or 5 times as i wrote this, sometimes once, sometimes twice in quick succession, at random intervals. 
i have zonealarm security, mcafee virusscan, spybot, and microsoft anti-spyware installed on a fairly standard windows xp machine. 
any help/ideas are appreciated!
