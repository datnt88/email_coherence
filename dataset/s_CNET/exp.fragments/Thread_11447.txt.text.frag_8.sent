the 1gb card for sure and a-data gaming series it is. 
this rig is for gaming. 
i'm not too picky about the sound quality but i 'could' get a sound card if needed it would only be added luxury. 
i would get the 965be but for the 1055t it's 26$ more to add on. 
thanks for the replies everyone. 
:] though with me being in the middle of a move i have to wait till i order my computer about another two months. 
i am going to save up some more so when the time does come i can get an intel machine with the rest of the build identical.
