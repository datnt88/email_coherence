incompatibility issues are common-place with vista, but activation issues with xp aren't. 
i don't know what type of issues you had, but if you have a legit copy of xp and an internet connection, activation is transparent. 
software absolutely can't kill hardware. the bios might kill it, a component might kill it, but the os can't.
