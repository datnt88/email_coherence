get a larger power supply, its the unsung hero of your system. it has to be stable in order to support all those goodies that get stuffed in the system. 
another cause for a jittery display is either the fan you got is just plain lousy(rfi cause) or too close to the monitor itself. 
the other causes mentioned by robert are just as valid. 
next, having 512 is about as good as it gets for basic win9x/me systems. 
get the ram first than add a faster processor, you benefit more from ram. the faster processor is good but overall unless you increase its ability at 25% performance, you probably won't notice and/or appreciate it &quot;affectionly&quot;. good luck -----willy
