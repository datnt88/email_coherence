that is, connect it to some linux box that serves it up as a postscript printer. 
it's a little rough on some but the gist is that many linux printer drivers take in postscript, render it to the raster that the printer wants and that gets printed. the longest i found someone to take setting this up is a few months. 
but they really wanted to save the printer.
