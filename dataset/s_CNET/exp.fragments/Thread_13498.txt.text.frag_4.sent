any corrosion, tilting, and such and i replace. 
there are a lot of other causes but monitors have gone so cheap that repairs are more than replacement unless the display is over 1,000 bucks you open it up and give an once over before you hand it back. 
long ago i would collect models to scavenge parts but now that disposal fees are the norm i have moved out of that as a way to get such up for free. 
there are other causes such as chips on boards but you are again back to the costs vs replacements.
