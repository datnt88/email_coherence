i'm sorry bob, guess i keep misunderstanding your questions. 
how would i go about finding out what firmware is in my befsr11 now? 
as i said, i tried to upgrade to 1.46.2 since i was unsure if i had already done that when linsys's tech's were trying to help me. 
i don't know what firmware is there currently, nor do i know how to go about finding out.
