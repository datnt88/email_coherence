slow down, since you're dealing with parts you haven't gotten. 
you do have a working pc, then update what can be done as necessary for what you have. 
once done, await the new ssd and then make sure it works after installation. 
once done, you update &quot;if&quot; you like or just update it once all is working 100%. 
that should be it, no need burden yourself beforehand. 
i do suggest you get the instructions, print them out and review them. 
as for the win 7 install, is this a re-install or new one?
