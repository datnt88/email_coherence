i'm not sure if this is the right forum section or not, but here goes: on an ati radeon x1650 pro video card, i have a 19&quot; flat pannel monitor hooked into the vga port. 
there is nothing wrong with that. 
everything works fine. the problem now is this: i went out and bought a dvi to hdmi cable. 
i plugged it into my graphics card, and then the other end to the tv. when i boot up the computer, it shows images on both the monitor and tv (which is what i want), but as soon as the actual windows kernel loads, the picture on the tv goes to the blank blue screen. 
can anybody help?
