yes, i learned about slave/master when i installed my cdr drive. 
what does the &quot;cable select&quot; setting mean? 
and how would i reformat the old hard drive? 
i'm really a novice at this type of stuff, although i do know the basics about computers so i learn things like this pretty fast. 
thanks for the help so far.
