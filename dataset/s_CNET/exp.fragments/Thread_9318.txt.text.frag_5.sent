thanks for the article. 
i'm going to email logitech and see if they can give me the url for the keyboard version of that page. 
this worked great for getting rid of the mouseware program, but i need the itouch program installed. 
this is probably the closest i've come to a solution, after working on this problem for over a week and taking about it on three discussion boards. 
thanks so much. 
it goes to show that sometimes personal experience can win out over pure, unadulterated knowledge.
