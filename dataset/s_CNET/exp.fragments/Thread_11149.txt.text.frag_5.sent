if you've got one of those dual gpu 7800gt's, well, great, but if you're looking to buy one, i wouldn't, for two reasons: a) only about 1000 exist, so they're hard to find b) they aren't worth the money/time compared to whats on the market in the $150 price range, i'd look at the hd 2900gt (as has been suggested), the hd 3850, and hd 3870 (all from ati) as well as the 8600gt, 8600gts, and 8800gt (yeah that ones gonna be a strech, and these are all from nvidia) and i would not go with xp x64, driver/application compatability is horrible (and yes ramarc, i see your driver link, now find links for every other device and piece of hardware he could ever intend to use with his computer, in addition to patches and updates for every piece of software he could ever intend to use for his computer) i'd go with xp pro honestly
