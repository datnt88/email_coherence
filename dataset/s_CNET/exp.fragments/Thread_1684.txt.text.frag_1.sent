i recently purchased a lcd monitor (dell ultrasharp 1905fp) which has both dvi-d and vga ports. the video card on my pc is ati x300 which also has both ports. 
which connectors should i be using between the pc and monitor? 
should i use the newer dvi-d connection or the serial vga connection? is there any advantages to using one over the other? 
please advise. 
thanks
