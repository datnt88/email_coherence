thank you rick! i am 99% sure mine does go: cable &gt; wireless router &gt; cable modem &gt; wired desktop, because i believe that's how the instructions said to do it! 
i am going to redo the connections as you suggested. 
will i also have to change any settings because of this setup change, or should changing the connection order alone do the trick?? thank you again! 
i will be so happy to get this pesky problem corrected!!.......gina
