laymens term means i dont know much about computers as such. 
wpa2 i think is something to do with security but i could be mistaken. 
if i hover the curser over the connection the it does not say wpa2 but wpa-psk. 
as afar as the signal goes then the other laptops can connect to this signal so i would doubt that it would be this. 
i cannot connect to the signal with this laptop but when i go to my sister's house i can connect to her signal and that is why i am puzzled. 
there does not seem to be anything wrong with it help!!!
