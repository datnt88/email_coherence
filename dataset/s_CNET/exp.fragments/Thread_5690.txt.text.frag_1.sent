i am considering purchasing either a gateway 827 gm or an e-machines t6212. 
from what i can tell both have less than a 350w psu. 
i'm planning on upgrading to a pci-e video card if i buy one of these systems. 
i'd feel more comfortable with a 450w psu, but have never swapped one of those out. 
how difficult is it to make that change? 
other than unplugging, securing the psu and reconnecting what is involved? 
thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
