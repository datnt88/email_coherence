my machine keeps telling me the server is trying to acquire an ip address. the internet provider says it's my machine. 
don't have a nic card. 
used cmd command & &quot;netsh int ip reset c:resetlog.txt&quot; and got my ip address after reboot. 
next time i turned on machine same problem. 
tried system restore but no help.
