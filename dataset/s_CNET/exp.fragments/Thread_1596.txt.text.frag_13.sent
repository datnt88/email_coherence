i also forgot to mention that at bb there is a 14 day return policy and a 15% restocking fee. 
you can buy the service plan up until the 14th day of the service plan. 
the restocking fee is obviously waived if there is any defect in the laptop. 
i can understand why there is a 15% restocking fee, as to deter people from &quot;renting&quot; the laptops until the one they really want comes out.
