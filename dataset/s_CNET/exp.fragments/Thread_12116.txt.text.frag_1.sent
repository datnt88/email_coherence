i have a dell precision m60 that i purchased in 2003. 
it's got a video card problem that looks to be very expensive to fix. 
i've been told to just buy a new computer. 
this time i would like a desktop. 
i am a small business owner. 
i use excel, word, and the internet heavily for my work. 
i also use autocad. 
i need a good solid machine, but i am on a budget. 
i didn't anticipate my m60 going down and there is only so much room in my budget for a new pc. when i spoke to some of the manufacturers, i felt like maybe i was getting talked into too much computer for my needs, but i really don't know. 
can anyone give me some guidance on what i really need? 
i want a good machine, but i don't want to get something that is totally beyond my needs. 
i appreciate anyone's thoughts.
