since your looking for vendor built pc's... why not have a look at ebay? 
they have so many pre-built pc's on ebay for cheaper than from an official branded vendor. 
i bought a full system with an amd athlon 3500+ for really cheap and it runs so so so so so well!!!! ebay is a great way to look for stuff!!! ngatiaruan.prince
