i have a vista pc and have attached a samsung ml-1740 (usb) laser printer to it. 
vista found the device, and installed drivers for it. 
it completed with no errors, and vista says it is ready for use. 
when i try and print to it, it fails to print with no real specific message. 
printing a test page from control panel, simply says &quot;test page failed to print. 
would you like to view the troubleshooter for assistance&quot;. 
i have deleted the printer, downloaded newest samsung drivers and installed again...still no go even though control panel says the printer is &quot;ready&quot;. 
any suggestions would be appreciated.
