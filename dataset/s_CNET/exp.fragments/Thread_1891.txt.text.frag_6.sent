hmmm matrix is on my z-640's and the z-640's are basically &quot;last year's model&quot; of the x-530 let me look up a picture of the x-530 and see if i can identify what your version of it is hmmm can't seem to find it on the z-640's it's located next to the knob which adjusts the center volume but i don't see anything like that on the 530's hmmm go into the thx console and tell it that you have 5.1 speakers then go into windows' thing and tell it that you have 5.1 speakers then try it and if it doesn't work it might just be the sound card (i've only tried it on my audigy 2 zs plat., never even tried it on the soundstorm integrated on my mobo)
