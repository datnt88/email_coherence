my printer, hp laserjet 4, recently just stopped working. 
my computer is using xp. i have been through the trouble shooter and did everything it told me to do, but it is still not working. 
it will print a test page, so there is nothing wrong with the printer. 
i would uninstall and reinstall it, but can't find where to do that. the printers don't come up in the add/remove hardware. 
also when i click on &quot;find printers&quot; i get an error message (directory service is unavailable) i am not savvy enough to know what printer drivers to delete manually. 
sigh.... i need my printer desperately.
