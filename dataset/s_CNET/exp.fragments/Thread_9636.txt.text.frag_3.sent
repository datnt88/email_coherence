problem there is when i plug the card in there is no output at all from the onboard socket. 
it just goes completely dead. 
can i still install drivers if the card is not in place? 
i tried and it came up saying it couldn't find any hardware to match. 
as i said, on the new card everything seems ok up until the windows xp screen. 
when it disappears and you expect to see windows loading up, the screen goes black and the &quot;no signal&quot; box comes up on the monitor. 
windows continues to load as you can hear its little jingle.
