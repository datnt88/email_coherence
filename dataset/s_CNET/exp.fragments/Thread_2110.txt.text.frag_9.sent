ths is just to clarify my post. 
on the memory, what i meant was the max memory running at 1600 mhz. 
as for the bottle necking aspect, with 1600 mhz memory and the i7 2600k cpu, that won't be an issue. 
that card you have chosen, nor others will be bottle necked. 
as i previously said, an x68 based board would be a good choice these days.
