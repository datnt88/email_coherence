your comments bring up a a little problem i have. 
i have two maxtor external harddrives (80 and 120) for backup. 
maxtor says i can use both. 
both have usb ports. 
my computer recognizes only one at a time, when both are connected. 
any hints to get the computer to recognize both? 
windows xp home edition.
