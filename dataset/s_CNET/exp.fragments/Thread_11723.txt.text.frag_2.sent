at the office we have the nexus 7 (original) and at home the fire 7 hd. the nexus has the edge on the kindle as there are more book readers there and you don't have as closed an ecosystem. 
games are a few more too. 
but for amazon prime video the fire 7 hd is hard to beat as we have ours connected to the hdtv with hdmi. 
it's the best player i've seen in years. 
tough choice but i like the fact the nexus is more open and still has the kindle app.
