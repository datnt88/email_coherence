event log has this: a duplicate name has been detected on the tcp network. 
the ip address of the machine that sent the message is in the data. 
use nbtstat -n in a command window to see which name is in the conflict state. 
for more information, see help and support center at . 
there are no other machines on the net at this time... need to leave for a few hours. 
i will check back later. 
thanks for all of your help!
