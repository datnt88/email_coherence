windows media center has services that are constantly running. 
you need to right click on my computer &gt; click manage &gt; then expand services and applications on the left &gt; click services &gt; find 'media center reciever service' and 'media center scheduler service' and right click them and click stop for both. 
you must start them again when your done to make sure media center runs properly. 
do not disable these services, just stop them.
