i have gone through about 5 pc's now, and usually because out dated. 
/ with the newer computers i really believe its best to leave pc on and use the &quot;stand-by&quot; or sleep mode when not using it for longer than 3hours. the only time i turn off, is if i am not going to be using it for longer than 48 hours, or for a update-restart. 
not good for the hard drive to shut it off and on/ will shorten life. 
/ hope this helps.
