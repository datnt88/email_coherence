i work for a small company, and i'm trying to link the production area with our office, however there is a concrete wall with no wiring going through it, the dsl line we use is in the production area hooked up to a d-link wireless router (model di-624). the wireless router/access point in the office is a linksys (model befw11s4 v.2), is there a way to bridge these two routers, or do i need to purchase something else. 
any advice would be helpful. 
thank you
