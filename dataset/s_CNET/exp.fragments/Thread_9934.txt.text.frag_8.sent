well, i fixed it. 
many thanks to r. proffitt for pointing me to disk management. 
i just sort of poked around in there for a bit and my computer all of a sudden recognized that the hard drive was there. 
what i did in disk management was tell it to create a new volume within the disk that was going to be the entire thing. 
i told it to go ahead and do a not quick format, which seemed to be taking forever, so i stopped it. 
then, my &quot;my computer&quot; found the hard drive, and decided that it wasn't formatted and that i should format it, which i did. 
quick this time. 
my computer still however thinks that there is a shiny new blue ray player, but i suppose apart from not being able to use disk letter &quot;h&quot; it's not really an inconvenience. 
thanks to everyone for the help! 
sorry it got fixed just by me messing around.
