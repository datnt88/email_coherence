i think it was kingston ram...it's not marked with anything except the size of 1gb (each stick) wondering....the bios (which probably needs to be updated but i haven't done that and is version 2.058) sees one stick as 1024mb. 
according to the manual, the limit for this board is 2gb. is it possible that because it's over that limit totally with two sticks that that could be what is stopping it? 
i'd have to check the bios to see what the voltage is already at. 
it's been a while since i began putting this together and i was using ddr ram as well with no problems.
