hello, i recently purchased an old hpe-210y desktop with the ati radeon hd5450 graphics card installed. 
i would like to have a large screen display for the desktop, but i want it to be clear and to fit proportionality on the monitor screen. 
i am currently considering buying a 29 inch lcd monitor display or a 32 inch led 720p television. 
i was hoping someone on this forum could provide me with guidance as to which purchase would be a better option. 
i do not play video games, but i do watch a lot of you tube videos and surf the net. the desktop also has a blue ray player. 
thanks. 
here is the link to the hp website that contains the computer specifications.
