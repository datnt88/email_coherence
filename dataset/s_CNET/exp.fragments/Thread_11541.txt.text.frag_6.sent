thanx for your reply. 
i don't have an hp. my pc was built in local shop. 
has amd athlon 1.8ghz processor. 
winxp home, 512mb ram; don't know what mobo it has or where to find model#. 
tried removing all pci cards as someone else suggested, but no results. 
any other suggestions. 
i didn't really want to pay over a hundred bucks just to have it looked at by local circuit city or best buy. 
thanx.
