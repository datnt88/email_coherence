hi, i would appreciate your help / advice / suggestions, with a networking problem. 
i have a smc2804wbr 2.4ghz 54mbps wireless cable/dsl broadband router that apparently is not powerful enough to broadcast the wireless signals through the walls in my house and would appreciate any advice / recommendatiosn / suggestions / ...., that will allow me to wirelessily connect 2 windowsxp pcs that are about 150 feet from each other but with several rooms and maybe 10 walls, between computer &quot;a&quot; and computer &quot;b&quot;? 
thanks, bob
