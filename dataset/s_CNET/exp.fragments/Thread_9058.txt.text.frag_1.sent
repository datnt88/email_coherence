the title explains itself. 
i have had this computer since 2004 and i am surprised how long it has been before i attempted to put an expansion card or look for more ram. 
i bought an expansion card recently and i don't think it fits. 
i did not know there were different kinds, so now i need to know which expansion cards will fit into a compaq sr1053wm. 
and obviously ram chips are not the same type either. 
what is the name or whatever for the type of ram chip and expansion slot that compaq sr1053wm uses??
