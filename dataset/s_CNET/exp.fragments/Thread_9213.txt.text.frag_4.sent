been doing a lot of research online regarding this matter and from what i have found along with contacting both companies i have decided to just opt for a nas drive instead. 
seems to be the only solution for my needs so i have just ordered the seagate nas110 seeing as the kids have two xboxs they can now watch all there movies.
