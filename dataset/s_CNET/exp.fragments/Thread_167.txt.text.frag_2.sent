i don't have a clue. 
i do have a question,,,,,why? 
let's say you could o/c to 800mhz. 
i wonder if you would see a diff. 
i suspect what you might see is smoke. 
suggestion,,, work it from the other end. 
learn how to shut down all the unnecessary processes/tasks/rubbish that are of no value to you and make the machine run slow.
