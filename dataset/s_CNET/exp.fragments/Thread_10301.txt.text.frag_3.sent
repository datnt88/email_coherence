it can be difficult to find a wap that is simply plug-n-play because the existing network setup might not match the default wap settings. 
i have used small wireless routers as waps for classrom and hotel use. 
they are usually called travel routers or compact routers. 
you plug it in, configure it once, and pop it into your notebook travel bag when you are finished. 
i have had success with the following compact/travel models: linksys wrt54gc linksys wtr54g netgear wgr101 i usually travel with linksys wrt54gc because it has a lot of functions and extra ports if needed.
