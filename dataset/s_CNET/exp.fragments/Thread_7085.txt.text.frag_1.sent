am building first pc from all new parts. 
have amd 64 3000 chip, w/ dfi lan party ut nf3 250gb moboard, plus 1gb ddr400 pc3200 ram, and radeon 9550 video card. the moboard came with cd for drivers for onboard chips, also have hd maxtor 200gb sata/150. 
plan on installing winxp pro os. once all hardware is set up, what software do i install and in what order. 
thought i would only install dvd-rom and floppy at first. 
sound card is on moboard. 
do i need install video card before installing drivers on moboard and hd drivers, and os??? appreciate someone giving a brief outline of steps. 
thanks!
