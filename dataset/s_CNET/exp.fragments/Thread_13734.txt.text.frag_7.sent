you can use a 2nd nvidia card as a physx accelerator (the gpu can't be used for graphics processing and physics processing at the same time) or just get a physx card. 
it's won't speed up a game... it will just enable you to turn advanced physics processing on (just like anti-aliasing won't speed up a game).
