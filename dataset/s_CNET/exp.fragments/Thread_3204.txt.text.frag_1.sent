i am installing windows xp pro on a two year old laptop that had windows xp home. 
i have found out that i bought the computer with a partitioned hard drive, one is primary, one is logical. 
i want to merge the two into the one whole and complete hard drive. 
i am staring from scratch, so none of the files are sacred. 
my xp disk does not give the option of merging and i can't afford the $100.00 for partition magic. 
are there other options for me out there? 
sony vio, 36 gb hd, 768 ram
