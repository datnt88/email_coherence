i took apart my notebook and cleaned the heatsink. 
the problem still resumes. the computer simply locked up except much less than 30 minutes. 
one thing i noticed was that even though windows was unresponsive - i was still able to change screen brightness by pressing fn and the up button. 
does this mean that the motherboard is still functioning despite the crashing?
