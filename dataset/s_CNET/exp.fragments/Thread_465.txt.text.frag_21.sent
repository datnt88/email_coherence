i decided with the advent of walking talking grandchildren, i needed something i could do video editing on as well as work so i built a relative monster. 
started with am intel dx38bt motherboard, combined that with 4g of ddr3 memoryand q6600 cpu added a pair of ati 3800`s in crossfire, added a pvr 3000 video/tv card and 2 300g hdd`s and dual dvd drives with a memory card reader, all in chakra case. 
put the whole thing together with 2 asus pw19 monitors(the most sexy looking monitors in my opinion ever) and just for good measure and good looks a dinovo edge keyboard and an mx revolution mouse. the black beauty runs on vista ultimate sp1, and i have never had any problems with it.i would also imagine that unless it gets stolen this machine will see me well through the next windows os, with the possible exception of upgrading the cpu to a q900 series.
