i have an hp 1315 all-in-one printer. 
i'm running windows xp. the printer suddenly started getting print cartridge jam messages. 
i found a switch inside that seemed to correct that, but then it started feeding extra paper through, one or two before the print job, and then one at the end. 
then i would get a paper jam message. 
but the paper isn't jammed, it just stops half way through. 
i have written to hp and gotten loads of advice, but nothing seems to change it. 
i can work around it for now, but it's getting old! 
i cleaned the rollers, i checked the driver update, i tried doing a reset, i restarted the printer spooler (whatever that does), i made sure the printer and the computer were plugged into the same power source (what in the world does that do?), i did a thing where you hold the on button and the copies button while the printer is turning on. 
nothing seems to help. 
why would it start doing this all of a sudden? 
do i need to get a new printer? 
it's only 2 years old. 
it's frustrating to have to replace things that quickly. 
i had my first hp printer for 7 or 8 years! 
i'd appreciate any good advice.
