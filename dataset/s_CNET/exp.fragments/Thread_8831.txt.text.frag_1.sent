i'm going to upgrade my computer soon. 
so i'll have: amd sempron 3300 2ghz 1gb ram sony 16x/48x dvd rom drive nvidia geforce 6600 i'm wondering what games i could run smoothly with these specs? 
i've heard that sempron is better than celeron for gaming. 
i'm particulary interested in playing fps's, half life 2, far cry, halo etc. could i play these smoothly? 
(i'm doubting i can play f.e.a.r?)
