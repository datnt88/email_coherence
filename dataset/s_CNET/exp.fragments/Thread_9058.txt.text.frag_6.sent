i found some phrases that might help: &quot;unbuffered&quot;... &quot;set timings&quot;... after reading about setting timings, it sounds very important but i am even more confused...i found another topic on the message boards about this one person with a completely customized computer and had 2 different types of timings and that resulted in crashes. 
this new chip will be 2 of 2 chips because that is what my present motherboard has. it only has 2 slots. 
how do i read what the timings are on my existing chip to make sure they are the same as the additional chip?? which timings are the most recommended...?? i do not know the name of the motherboard. 
it is just whatever usually came with a sr1053wm machine.
