i appreciate your faith in my pc luck, but ... the p4p800 was built in the spring of 2005 and yes while my home office on the 2nd floor of my townhome does get a bit warm, (typically in the low 80s), that is not my concern because i have enough fans in this (antec slk3000b) mid-tower case to make it fly if not hover. 
likewise, i used rounded cables for both my ide and power to improve air flow. 
i have my cpu temp threshold monitor set at 140f and it has only given alarm twice in three years. 
(current room temp is 82f, cpu is 113f, mobo is 86f) my first cad workstation had two mobo failures and while the first one was covered under warranty this second failure most likely by power surge (despite being connected to an apc ups) could not be repaired/replaced. 
i've also had two motherboard failures of the second cad machine one with the p4p800 and another with the p4c800, one of those being covered by warranty. 
so not wanting to look forward to tearing apart my computers at least every couple of years to replace motherboards, i find myself asking for assistance. 
as to complaints regarding the solid state hds, i have not seen any flaming reviews of them, but then again as i am hoping this current workstation will hold out at least another year, it will give the solid state gurus a chance to improve on some of the shortcomings, including the outrageous pricing. 
my own observations:
