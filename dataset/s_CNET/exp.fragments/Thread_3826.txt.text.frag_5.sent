i am having somewhat of the same problem, only am using 512 of ram but wanted to upgrade my 40gb hard drive (as it is failing) with a new 250gb hard drive. 
i have basically the same computer, gateway select 1400cs with the 1.4 ghz amd. 
my computer will only show 127 gb of the new 250gb hard drive. 
wanted to update my bios but the only updated i could find was the one on gateway, i can't find the current bios driver i am using or the motherboard exact model. 
which limits me on finding a bios driver update. 
my floppy has never gone bad and am using new pre-formatted ibm floppy disk, at start-up comp will not read bios update from the booted floppy. 
returns with the same thing you stated...&quot;non-system disk or disk error replace and strike any key&quot; you ever have any luck booting the new bios version or finding a better download to update bios. 
let me know, thanks.
