and just one more thing... what about different countries. 
if a channel is allocated a specific frequency, will that frequency be not available for any other country as well. 
this was just an extension of my previous post but if the question wasn't clear this is it. 
also i tried to catch a radio channel which is there in some other state, but i couldn't from where i stay.
