i brought a new laptop hp dv6. the problem is the printer i am using, it is on a home network and was running fine. 
now it is real slow and it prints pages with one or two lines or nothing at all. 
i talked to hp before i even got the laptop and they said it was vista ready. the printer is not even a year old. 
it is a photosmart 7200 all in one. 
i am wasting paper like water. 
help
