i have owned,,,,and looked at several lcd monitors of different brands,,,sony, iiyama,samsung,,,,,and they all squish the images slightly. 
ie,,,a square looks slightly rectangular, and a circle slightly elliptical, as opposed to my crt which shows images as they should be. 
why is this. 
btw, there are no adjustments for this.
