??? just to clarify... are saying that i got the wrong ram? 
i'm pretty sure i got the ddr2 dimm 5300 1gb. 
which said it was backward compatible with the ddr2 dimm 4200 512mb that my computer came with. 
so, my computer needs the 4200 and is not compatible with other ram? 
or i just happened to get bad ram and this is one of the errors that can result from bad memory? 
sorry, i can be a little dense if things aren't spelled out for me... thanks for the quick reply joel
