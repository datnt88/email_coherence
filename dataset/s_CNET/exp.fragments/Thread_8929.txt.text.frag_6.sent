&quot;what about if the router is not fully utilised by me? 
for example, the router is connected to 20 people, so i'd get 1/20 of the bandwith.&quot; 
you get a portion of the unused bandwidth. 
if no one is using the internet, you get 100% of that. 
it appears you are very new at this and need to get out there and watch what happens.
