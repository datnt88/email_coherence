you can get a secured 2 gigs of storage. 
this is plenty of storage for documents, and typical office files, such as excel, photographs etc. also, files can be worked on and saved to the dropbox file, and collaborative efforts are possible however, if you mutually work on a file, you cannot work in a &quot;whiteboard&quot; fashion. 
so, it is best if one person works a file and saves it, before the person on the other end picks up and works on it.. also, it's a good idea to keep a back up copy of files in a separate folder, even if it's another dropbox. 
there are other cloud storage options, but i've found dropbox to be simple to use, and simple to implement. 
if you find it valuable for your business, you can also add storage and the price is reasonable..
