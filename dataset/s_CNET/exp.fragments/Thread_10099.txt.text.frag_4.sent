i'll monkey with it more. 
this has been the case for a long time an isn't disastrous. 
the other desktop pcs have similar user accounts/passwords on them so connecting and sharing is a no-brainer. 
interestingly, i can connect to my company provided laptop which is in a domain. 
i am presented with a login screen and must provide the necessary domain information. 
i don't have a similar account on this laptop as my desktop either. 
still, i can connect to a share i created to move files back and forth. 
as for understanding the difference between &quot;everyone&quot; and &quot;anyone&quot;, yes, i certainly am aware of that. the puzzle to me is why, without similar accounts on these two devices, i can connect from one but not the other. the other desktops have an account with her username/password and so they connect readily. 
certainly i can create an account on either my desktop or her laptop that matches an existing one and it will work as expected.
