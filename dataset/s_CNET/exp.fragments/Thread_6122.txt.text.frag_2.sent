ive had my external drives crash on me a few times in the past, and ive been able to get all me data back successfully (luckily) i use runtime get data back ( ). it comes in two version, for fat and ntfs partitions. the free trial version allows you to search your hard drive for lost files, and open the files/folders it finds, however it does not allow you to recover them, for that you need the full version. 
i have never had all my files corrupted when my drives fail and i have never heard of it either. 
hope this helps
