it depends on the disc, program and content. 
i've had movies start to deteriorate after 5 times viewing. 
pictures, some data files seem to last longer. 
as well the burning software makes a difference. 
some video burning software seems better at retaining data integrity. 
not sure why, but after numerous burns some files seem to hold together. 
even the reader plays a difference. 
some dvd players interact better with some burnt dvd's than others. 
rule #1 - you usually get what you paid for. 
i've picked up no-name blank spindles for a good deal but they haven't lasted long. 
some swear by verbatim (at usually at a higher price). 
you can check here: for a reader survey of what dvd media works best. 
in any event - this 50+ years is true - if you keep it locked up and away from heat/humidity/dust. 
but if you want to use the dvd's from time to time, i'd say make a back-up the more frequently you use it and make sure you verify to ensure full successful copy.
