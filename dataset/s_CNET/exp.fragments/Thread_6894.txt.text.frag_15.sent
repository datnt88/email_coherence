again.. i'm talking about density which shares physical characteristics on the actual form factor, only differentiating on fpga and filter bus **sometimes**(note this has nothing to do with stick form..again), and asking why they don't mark ram with usable density markings instead of ones with double meanings that lead to consumers buying incompatible ram. 
not once have i mentioned anything about changing the physical form of ram; in fact it has nothing to do with the subject of the thread you're trying to criticize..
