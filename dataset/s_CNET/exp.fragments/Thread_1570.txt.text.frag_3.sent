thanks for the perspective r. proffitt. 
it's interesting you refer to these machines as &quot;high end.&quot; both manufacturers (gateway for the intel, zt systems for the amd) bill these machines as home/home office and the prices of $499 and $599 suggest &quot;medium&quot; computers! the reviews i can find for the gateway (sx2802-03) say it's &quot;whisper quiet.&quot; 
can't find any pro reviews on the zt but other zt systems are reported to be loud as you suggest. 
i generally keep my computers for 5-7 years and don't generally &quot;upgrade&quot; them with the likes of fancy video or sound cards, or additional drives. 
i think either will meet my needs for several years so will probably go with the gateway since it is a small form factor size and &quot;whisper quiet&quot;! 
thanks again for your input.
