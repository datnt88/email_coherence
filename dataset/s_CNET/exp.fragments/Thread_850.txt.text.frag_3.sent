which after a wee bit of 'research' i understand isn't actually a 'modem' (a transceiver?). my biggest worry is getting lots of hardware rigged together and discovering that my isp wont work through it. the adsl 'modem' is supplied by them along with a disc, which i'm worried may contain stuff that only works with that modem. 
unfortunately the net is very sparse on information regarding this.
