the bios upgrade fixed the fan roar/restart issue. 
my keyboard died and gateway replaced it under warranty. 
and finally, the video card died and i just gave up after a replacement failed to work also. 
i think the motherboard may have been damaged by the video card. 
i just removed the nvidia video card use the integrated video interface (the one covered by a sticker).
