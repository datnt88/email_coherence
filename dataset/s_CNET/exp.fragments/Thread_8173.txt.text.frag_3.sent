will still not stop them taking the info, all they have to do is turn off the gps, delete the app or use a faraday cage. 
you want too set the password lock on the units & look into something like datavault, also do not let the users use any im, there are backdoors hacks for the ipad using im. in the end the safest thing is never put very important info on any networked computer or a computer that can be taken home/out of office.
