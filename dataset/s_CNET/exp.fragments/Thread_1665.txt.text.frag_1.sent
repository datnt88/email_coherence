i have a compaq v5101us laptop and im often sitting right next to a power outlet while working on it. 
my thoughts were to always just plug it in while im on it but i that that is bad for some batteries on some other types of devices other than computers and i was wandering if it is also bad for the computer. 
should i just run it on battery and then charge it when it is low and then run it on battery again, or just always plug it in when i can and run it on full like that? 
will one promote longer battery life? 
thanx for the responces
