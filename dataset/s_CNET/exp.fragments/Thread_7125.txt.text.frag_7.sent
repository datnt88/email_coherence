you can't change the multiplier on an intel. 
no motherboard that supports intel cpus gives you the option to change it because it's locked on most intels. 
i have heard of a few motherboards giving you the option *and even then you can only change it if it's one of the rare unlocked intels* but i don't remember what they were.
