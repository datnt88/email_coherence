i bought this product a few months ago and i have been presently surprised with how well it streams mp3's and jpeg's from a computer to my stereo and adjacent hdtv. the only downside is that it will not stream aac/mpeg4 files. 
accordingly, i have listed on ebay and i am going to get an ipod. 
my question is, does anyone know of a mp3 wifi streaming device that also supports aac file formats?
