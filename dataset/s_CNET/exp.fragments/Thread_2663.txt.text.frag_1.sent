i'm a photographer and i'm trying to get raw images (.cr2) from my pc to another person's mac. 
i think i have tried jpgs and they didn't work either so the file extension should be irrelevant but there you go just in case. 
it's a couple of weddings so they are huge files. 
here's what i've tried: *i put each folder on my external hard drive, 14g worth. 
when i am done i see that the images transferred fine and my hard drive is 14g fuller now. 
i hand that over to the mac person and he says the folders are empty when trying to view from his computer. 
*then i got his external hard drive and ended up with the exact same result. 
his drive was 14g fuller and everything. 
fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads i have burned discs for him and they come up empty as well what do i need to do? 
please help!
