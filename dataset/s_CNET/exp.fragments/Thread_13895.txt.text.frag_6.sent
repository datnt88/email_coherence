sine you mentioned you replaced the old psu 6mos. 
ago you maybe experiencing a 2ndary problem. the final act of a dying system. 
i can't guarantee the new psu will fix it, it's just a course of action to take when the system won't power-on. 
all too often when a burnt psu as you say, it could very well weaken or stress or outright take another compoment or device with it, if not now, later. 
try: for examples. 
yes, a bad caps situation can be corrected, but only if you're capable and/or allow a local source to fix it. 
if outside repair, it maybe more practical to just buy another mtrbd.. for money better spend.
