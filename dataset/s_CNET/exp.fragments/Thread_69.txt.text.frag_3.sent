first ask yourself; 1-is there anything wrong with my current picture?(too 
grainy, jerky, pixelated), 2-how much do i want to spend? 
a $100-$300 agp won't give you $100-$300 worth of improvement. 
if you want a good card it'll cost you a quite a bit and seeing as you don't play games, this is probably an unnecessary expenditure for you. 
even so, if money isn't an issue, sure go ahead. 
happy viewing
