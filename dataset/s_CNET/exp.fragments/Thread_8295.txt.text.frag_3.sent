file and print sharing is checked off on both puters in windowz firewall. 
as for turning the firewall off and on to network my desktop (in the basement) and the laptop (upstairs) is not only inconvenient to do each and every time i want to share files, but counterproductive to the firewall itself i think. 
so to answer your questions, no, i haven't tried that yet, but just out of curiosity i will. 
i did read another discussion about something similar, computer1 could see the shared folders on computer2 but not vice versa. 
i can see them on both but can only actually access the lappy from the desktop. the laptop is new (bought about 2 months ago) and i did have to use the recovery disk that came with it once, right at the begining when i had issues with nav05. 
i could see some of the networking settings being lost but like i said, i can see the files just not access them. 
&quot;my network places&quot; window stops responding for a min or so, then without actually opening up the folder i clicked on, it begins to respond again, where i am free to click on a shared folder again only to have it freeze again.
