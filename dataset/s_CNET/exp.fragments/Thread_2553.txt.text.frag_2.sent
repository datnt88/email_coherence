usb and parallel. 
then we have the 100mb, 250mb and maybe other models. 
i can't search for you because the details are missing such as which os, what pc, etc. however i have used a livecd call ubuntu to get the data off the zip drive media without too much pain. 
i use that method since we usually only need to get the files out then with that out of the way we can put it back in storage, sell it or give the old thing away.
