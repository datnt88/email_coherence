yes, i opened the tower and &quot;spring-cleaned&quot; it. 
there was a &quot;little&quot; dust there (i couldn't even see the fans properly), so i took a screwdriver, little paintbrush and the respirator and went on cleaning for 1 hour. 
i even asked my husband to open the &quot;energybox&quot; to get acces to that fan too. 
i unplugged and replugged all the wires as far as the cooperated easely, the others (really sticky ones) i contented to give them a little push.however i didn't found any ghosts... no electric shocks, mayby because i left the tower off for a whole night. 
so far, so good. 
till now, the pc didn't have any weird behaviour. 
one last question: i have now a hard disk of 20 giga. 
can i replace it for a bigger one (say, 80 giga) with the configuration i have now?
