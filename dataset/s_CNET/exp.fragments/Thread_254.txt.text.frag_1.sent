i own a philips 107b4 model crt monitor. 
i'm satisfied with what i've bought, but for the past several weeks the picture gets more and more distorted. 
the distorsion is in an &quot;eye&quot; shape, which means the corners of the picture &quot;move&quot; toward the mid of the monitor (upwards and downwards respectably). 
i've found good reviews on this crt model, but here, in macedonia, noone knows why the picture gets distorted. 
what should i do?
