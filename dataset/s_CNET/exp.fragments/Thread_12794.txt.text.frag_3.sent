as you know all pc's have an ip address, like a phone number or home address. 
they all are different. 
most ip address are dynamic, meaning they change every day. 
that way it is harder for spyware, etc. to catch on. 
but some places need a solid ip address, like servers. 
people are always accessing websites and it would be very difficult if google's ip address changed ever day. 
might be a bad example, but you get the point. 
to &quot;renew&quot; your ip address: start, settings, network connections. 
double click your active connection and click repair in the support tab.
