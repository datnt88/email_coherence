the whole mechanism of the grip rollers is very simple. the springs attached or part of this mechanism are flat or torque type. 
what happens over time they flatten(increased gap) for whatever reason and thus allows spring pressure to lessen and further the rollers themselves are less robust in grip power and/or adhesion of wheels to grip and the gap of paper to wheel is increased. 
many times the reason the springs flatten is too much paper in the tray makes the grip wheels be forced to grip paper and under this condition weaken springs being stressed and thus flatten during use. 
take all of this together you have a problem of paper feed. 
thus, if multiple paper is introduced can easily lead to paper jams or &quot;misfeeds&quot;. this will lead to actually paper feeds or timeouts during the &quot;pick cycle&quot;(feeds) and cause an error condition. 
overall, the cost of printer allows this to happens and having any long period of use(yrs.) is open to debate. 
i have a hp1350 given to me which is the same model overall and returned to service as i knew what to do or live with it.
