because both the hardware and software have to be compatible, which i can't be certain about, which is why media portal was suggested to me, it has the option of codec additions/manipulation being open source and yes, your post lacked details such as xp. the 4gb is interesting as i find some apps fail with over 1gb ram installed. 
another good reason to look at replacing apps. 
good points the hang you describe reminds me of codec troubles. 
if it is a codec the new software usually fails too. 
that's what i meant by &quot;hacking&quot; my own stuff. 
i'm not computer illiterate but not anything close to an accomplished hacker either. 
try this -&gt; dvd flick. 
i capture with what i have and create the dvd with that without much fuss. 
i have dvd flick also, but again you can't capture certain things with a dvd recorder. 
not recommending copyright theft but i also have problems with the law which prohibits backing up (protecting) what i already own. 
i'm not the only one that thinks that law is troublesome. 
i don't (can't) use a dvd recorder to capture also answers ahtoi about (why?) so it does hang while capturing. 
again i find this to usually be the codec issues. 
try setting the encoding during capture to something simple. 
i found it to be easier to capture, edit then transcode or encode to dvd later. 
bob that's a thought bob, i might give that a try though it complicates things somewhat, and also i'm still working with hardware/software with no support (firmware, software upgrade, etc.)
