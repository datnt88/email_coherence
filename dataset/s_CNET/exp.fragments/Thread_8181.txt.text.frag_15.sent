this has been driving me crazy. 
all of my pcs and media devices (except 1 - windows 7 x64 connected by coax through nim100) could see each other. the windows 7 x64 box could see network devices but could not see media devices. 
upnp, dlna, ipv6, ssdp, etc were not routing properly to/from this device. 
i have been uninstalling updates and software for 2 weeks. 
i've changed all of my firewall settings, disabled av's, rebooted the router, changed pc name, changed ip, ran wireshark - everything. 
nothing was fixing this. 
now up to the last month or so, everything had been fine for a year. 
i finally came across this article and changed my dhcp type and back again. 
now everything is visible again! 
for how long, though... sidenote: my router shows firmware version 20.20.0 - this shouldn't be from all the sites i went to. 
i never changed it either.... thank you for the workaround!
