i have ordered a dell m1330 with a 64 gb ssd drive. 
my thought was to buy an external 2.5&quot; drive and enclosure using usb. 
i realized that the dell has sataii but no port. 
can i use an express card with sata ports to connect with the dell for data and use an external power supply for power or use a usb connector for power. 
any specific hardware suggestions? 
will it work? 
hard drive suggestions 320gb? 
enclosure suggestions? 
thanks
