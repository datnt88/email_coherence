something in the line which announces the ownership of the flash drive? 
not sure whether the .inf 
file does that, as like sony or similar manufacturer, they produces their own particular 'signature' to it through the inf auto-run file. 
but it could be bypassed. 
not very sure whether win7 bitlocker works.
