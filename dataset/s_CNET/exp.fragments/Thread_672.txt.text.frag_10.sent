i am using my account on the users computer. 
if it were lan settings wouldn't the problem be consistent? 
this problem crops up for a week then dissapears for a month, etc. for example one user has told me that she usually will get disconnected 1 during the time people are complaining, but today it has happened 5 or 6 times to her.
