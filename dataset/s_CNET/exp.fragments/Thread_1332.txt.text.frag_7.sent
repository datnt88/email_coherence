aiw cards have always been klutzy hardware. 
ccc suite too. 
try removing ccc leaving only the hw drivers, and of course keep tv software. 
i dump ccc on any ati cards i use. 
in one installation, it caused the whole screen to be a nice shade of magnolia pink in default settings and it wasn't even spring! 
don't know why mso2003 and patches would be a problem. 
i don't use auto update but have installed mso sp3 and xp sp3 and post patches which include all previous hotfixes and some optional components from sp2. 
don't install hw driver updates shown in ms update unless you know for sure they will work (duh, how can anyone know that unless testing in a lab); been known to crash or hang up some pcs. 
auto update should not be delivering hw drivers. 
finally, tread carefully when using tv adapters because i have found some tuner and pvr sw break too easily when other hw/sw are installed/uninstalled. 
good luck with your recovery.
