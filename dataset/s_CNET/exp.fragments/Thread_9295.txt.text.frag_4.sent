for example, we have some p4 1.9 ghz machines that perform like p3 800 mhz machines all due to a mistake by me to recycle some sticks of sdram. 
since the deed is done and the machines are used for email, open office and have no payback if i was to fix this issue, i haven't changed the motherboards and ram, but i still kick myself over that one. 
bob ps. oh, if your board does sdram, you won't see the bx issue i noted.
