im in need of a laptop and i will need it for the everyday what not, but i will also be using it for dj'ing which needs speed. 
so... should i go for the... intel pentium m processor 730 (1.6ghz, 2mb l2 cache, 533mhz fsb) or mobile intel pentium 4 processor 538 (3.20ghz1, 1mb l2 cache) according to allot of research, i know its just gaming specs, but u can get an idea that these m cpu's dont suck in speed and even better than some p4's. 
but this is one of the reasons of the thread, im confused on this chip.
