i will be getting a new laptop soon and returning the current one. 
i have a question on backing up existing programs and settings so that i can load/copy exisitng programs to the new pc. it straight forward to me on copy/loading back documents, pics, etc. it is finding a easier way to copy all the programs i use for business, that i would like to find a simplier way than reload every program and so through the set up. 
current pc - xp pro new pc - xp home external hdd with plenty of space for copying. 
i am considering adding another external hdd, and have read some of maxtor and imogeainof on back up sw, would that work for me? 
what ever i use, if possible would like to be able to mirror 3 other pc's on my home network for back up also. 
i seen reviews on drive image and others? 
thoughts and suggestions from here? 
thank you
