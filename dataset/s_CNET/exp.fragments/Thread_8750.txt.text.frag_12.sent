if i were i would rather purchase a new set of mboards, processors, rams, graphic cards and other interfaces. 
i recently purchased intel core 2 duo boards and cpu, w/ 160 gig of hdd, a 2 gig of ram, and 512 mb of graphic card and its cost me around 25,000 pesos or if i convert it into dollar i thinks its around 500 usd? 
yeah its 500 usd and its worth it! 
i enjoy vista and lot more no crash down no slow boot up and of course a nice gaming environment.. dont take it seriously im just suggesting because if you upgrade yours you wont prevent any errors and malfunctions to occur. 
thanks and hope tis will you.
