i was skeptical of bkess's post since the grinding noise seemed way louder than a dirty rail would cause, but a good swipe across it with a cloth actually did stop the noise... except, where before it made the noise when it started up, now it makes the same noise on shutdown! 
at least it's briefer now. 
but it's not something we can ignore. 
this kind of noise really isn't acceptable from any manufacturer, and the fact that so many people are experiencing it is pretty damning. 
i definitely won't be replacing this beast with another canon.
