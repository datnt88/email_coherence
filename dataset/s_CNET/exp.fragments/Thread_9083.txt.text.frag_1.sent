hi, i recently posted because my sony dvd rw dw-d22a(oem,made by liteon as i learnt after i bought it)stopped writing and only sometimes read cds,not dvds.after trying everything bob gently advised and having not luck,i brought it to the technician who said:&quot;sorry,the laser is worn out like those old light tubes.its 
expected after a year of use.'' im not sure if thats totally true.how 
can a dvd burner have so short life expectancy,right? 
i mean,they are in the market for some years now.its 
not a brand new technology.so,my 
question is... what do i have to do to take care of burners?because there must be a list of dos and donts.and 
all along this year i was surfing the internet and paying attention to all the cd forums and sites around,but never found a list of dos and donts,or at least some care tips more than cleaning the media. 
would you mind giving your advice?it would be great if most of you talk about your personal experience with burners:how long did they live and how did they &quot;die&quot; and so on.hahahaaa! 
well,you understand. 
thanks everyone, claudia
