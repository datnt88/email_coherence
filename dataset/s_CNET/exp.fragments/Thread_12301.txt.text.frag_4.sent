if you did a clean install of xp, why reformat again? 
you got lost me here. 
just finish the os install and then add the drivers as required. 
then proceed to the ms windows update website and get the latest os updates, etc.. once all that is done, then add(install!) your pgms. 
and swap your saved data to the required folders. 
don't just place folders and try swapping data that way, it won't work at least for many of the more complex pgms. 
just re-install them. 
make sense?
