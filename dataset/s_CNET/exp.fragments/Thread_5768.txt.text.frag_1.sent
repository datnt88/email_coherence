systemax systems amd athlon (tm) processor 1.00 ghz, 512 mb ram windows xp home version 2002 service pack 2 last week my cdrw drive was left open and someone broke it with their knee. 
i went out and bought a new internal drive for $34 called &quot;i/o magic&quot;. the instructions say the drivers will be installed when i reboot, no software disc needed. 
i removed the broken drive (taking photos of every move i made and i marked all 3 cables needed). 
i then installed the new drive. 
it opened and closed and the light came on. 
i then went to &quot;my computer&quot; and the drive was not there. 
i put an audio disc in to see if it played and it didn't. 
i then went to i/o magics website and by it's appearance, i didn't expect much. 
i found drivers for this drive, downloaded and nothing. 
they recomended i restart in safe mode and it wouldn't. 
i removed he new drive and am now wondering if there's something i missed or shold have tried. 
any and all suggestions are appreciated.
