i think you might be getting confused with 64-bit. 
as long as the operating system deals with dual-core processors correctly, the applications don't need to do anything extra to support them. 
win xp pro can take two threads of a normal application and run them through seperate cores. 
mac os x does the same thing. 
the linux smp kernel does it too. 
some programs might crash if run on a multi-core machine on a system which supports it, but that's something different. 
64-bit support, on the other hand, needs to be coded into applications. 
----------- may i just add that dual-core processors are good for thin-client situations? 
on linux, you can have all tasks performed by a server, and have many thin clients which just transmit key presses and mouse movements, and recieve screen image in return (well, it's not actually a screen image, but that's just the easiest way to describe it). 
a multiple-core processor works wonders in these servers, as programs can then run in each core.
