i will do that tonight and thank you for the info on the heat sinks. 
hp said that cleaning out the computer would help with heat problems and even provided puctures on how to do it! 
i have done this before, but regret to say that i have not done this in a while. 
i will take the computer outside tonight and use an airsprayer to clean it out. 
i hope it works!
