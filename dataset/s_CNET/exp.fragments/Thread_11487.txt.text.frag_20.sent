one word, hacking. 
wireless networks increase the chances you will be hacked. 
internal networks are not accessable from the outside, wireless networks are accessable within 'the zone'. 
i have wanted to use this link for quite a while now what you should ask is why someone would want to hack your net. the answer is simple, simply obserbing over the air transmissions can allow a person to gain access to sensitive infromation (such as your name, credit card, and possibly your ssn). 
this, of course, would be infromation gathered though your daily use of the net. 
most people have their names associated with their accounts, many people shop online, and some people use online bill paying. 
now before you go proclaiming that it is remember that this guy is not hacking the webserver but just listining in to what you are broadcasting. 
now the real issue is the chances that a person would be skilled enough or care enough to try hacking your network would try hacking your network. 
i guess that it would better depend on where you live... personally, i say that the chances are negligable, identity theft may be common, but getting a wireless network sniffer working and learning how to filter the infromation out takes time. 
lots of time... eventually people may start making a practice of it, but when can not be said for certain.
