hello everybody my company is looking at developing an embedded isdn product for both pri and bri for use in uk, europe and n. america. 
we use our own circuit based on a freescale mpc885 core. 
we are looking for an isdn stack in source code (royalty free). 
what are the most reliable and robust isdn stacks out there (with good support)? 
thanks
