i don't see a server in the group. 
time and time again you find people try to use xp or a desktop os as a server. 
read as an example. 
about those ip problems. 
again &quot;where's the server?&quot; 
comes up as what is managing the ip assignments? 
i read where you hard assigned the numbers but without a dns and matched dhcp server most of these setups will be tedious and failure prone.
