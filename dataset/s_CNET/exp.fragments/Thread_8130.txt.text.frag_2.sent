no details i can find to start a discussion but since &quot;xp&quot; knows nothing about what to do with the fan (that's a driver thing) what you asked can be answered with &quot;sounds proper for xp.&quot; if you want to look into if such is possible we'd have to see if the unit has fan controls. 
most desktops didn't have such.
