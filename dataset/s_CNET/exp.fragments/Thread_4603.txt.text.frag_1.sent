hi. i'm sure you all get this question often, but how do i stop my computer from turning on by itself at night? 
i have built my own computer, and recently it began turning itself on around two in the morning. 
i have checked the bios for any &quot;wake on&quot; settings, and they are all off. 
any help would be greatly appreciated! 
thanks, brice smith
