sorry the driver didn't contain any update. 
ok there are other reasons for this to crash. 
let's try a few tools and scans. 
1. run winsockfix. 
retest. 
2. scan with this tool, tell me if it found anything other than cookies. 
if there were any pests removed repeat item 1. 3. i wasn't sure if it crashed everytime, but if so what else is in the event viewer?
