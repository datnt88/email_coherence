just wanted to add that i am suffering a similar problem (based on two xp pro systems). 
i thought that it would be a good idea to use a usb flash drive as a backup for my digital camera. 
thought it would be more useful for file sharing. 
i have tried two different drives (16gb and a 32gb) and the same thing happens. 
i have always taken them out correctly, used all the scan disks and recovery utilites, and still no luck. 
folders randomly empty themselves, or leave corrupt files. 
any suggestions on what is going wrong would be really helpful. 
thanks
