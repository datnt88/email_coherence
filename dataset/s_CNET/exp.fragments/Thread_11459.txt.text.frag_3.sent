thanks. 
first i want to say i feel like a putz. 
it is a c7280. 
i went to uninstall the drivers for the 7200 and they were not even there. 
so i downloaded the proper drivers. 
it is working now. 
but i keep on getting a pop up about the imaging device not being there. 
i think they are talking about the scanner which i never use. 
i know i installed all of the drivers for the printer so i do not know why it is saying that. 
otherwise it is working like it is suppose to. 
thanks again.
