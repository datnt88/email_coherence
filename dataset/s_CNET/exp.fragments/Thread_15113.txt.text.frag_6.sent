-&gt; finds knoppix and pages about knoppix in no time at all. 
plus said pages will tell you about knoppix in many ways. 
i can't guess which method works for you and as such will not write much about knoppix except to share it's how i test a cdrw before i replace the drive. 
k3b is the cd recording software included in the knoppix cd and ... very easy to use. 
again, with all the documention on k3b plus it's help pages, i see no need to repeat that content except to share it's the tool i use. 
hope this helps, if you didn't write that your nero is something bundled with another drive then you are trying to use if with a newer cdrw, then that's your loss. 
that results in the scenario you have presented. 
just so you can burn cdr/w media the nice software from is free and may help you get by until you fix your issue.
