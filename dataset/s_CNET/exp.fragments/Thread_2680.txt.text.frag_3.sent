a couple years ago i gave an old computer to a friend in trenton. 
it was like, why not give it to them instead of throw it away. 
i didn't reformat the hard drive however and the windows kept my name as the registered owner. 
i was upset because the cd-rw drive wouldn't open so i got a new computer from sears.com. 
life is good. 
you should order a computer from geeks.com or something. 
good luck. 
i don't think i could send a computer outside of my country, let alone my state. 
it would cost too much for me and take too much effort.
