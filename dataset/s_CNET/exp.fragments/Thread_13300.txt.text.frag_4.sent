has what i need to know. 
1. pcie x16 slot. 
2. psu wattage 375 w i'm going to share i used a zotac gt240 1gb fanless card from amazon.com. 
i mention this because i have it and put it on a watt meter. the entire hp d4999t with this card barely breaks 120 watts during a video game. it is under 100 watts at most other times. 
this means it won't push you into a power supply upgrade. 
here's the link -&gt; it is under 92 bucks.
