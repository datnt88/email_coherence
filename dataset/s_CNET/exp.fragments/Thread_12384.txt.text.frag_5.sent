actually willy, it's the type of switch that you can actually hear or feel the click in order to turn off the computer you have to depress the switch quickly till it clicks and release...when resetting the computer it dosent shut down automatically...the prompt jus states &quot;it's safe to turn orr your computer now&quot;...im thinking its probly the switch ...but im not a tech and dont really know how to test it
