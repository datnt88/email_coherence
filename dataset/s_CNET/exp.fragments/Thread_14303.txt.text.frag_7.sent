it should be cable &gt; cable modem &gt; wireless router &gt; wired desktop or cable &gt; cable modem &gt; wireless router if it's connected like this, your settings for your wireless router should not change. 
if you have it hooked up like this: cable &gt; wireless router &gt; cable modem &gt; wired desktop or cable &gt; wireless router &gt; cable modem this is wrong! 
hope this helps.
