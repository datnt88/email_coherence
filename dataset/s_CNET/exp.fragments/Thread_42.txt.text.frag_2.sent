i do pretty much the same thing as you and the i7 processor is excellent. 
i use adobe cs5 with no slow downs no matter what i throw at it. 
also get at least 6 gig of ram. 
mine has 12 gig, but i think that is a little overkill. 
mine is tri channel ram. 
i know there is a debate about tri channel being no faster or better than the duel channel, but i disagree with that. 
as for the monitor, get a 22' or bigger led monitor. 
they throw off very little heat and have a better picture than the lcds. 
also get a good graphics card in the computer. 
for the little added expense, you won't be sorry.
