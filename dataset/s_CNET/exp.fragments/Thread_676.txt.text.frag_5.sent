use acronis - home backup - scheduled daily to backup personal stuff (incremental) to a local 2nd drive. 
- every week or two i do a full image backup, using same software acronis. 
very easy to use. 
never done a restore, but there is a restore dvd that i created and should work fine :-/ restoring a file from backups is just toooo easy. 
just dive into the backup file, and browse round to the dated version that you want.
