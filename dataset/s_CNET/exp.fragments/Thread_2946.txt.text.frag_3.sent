there is no reason adding a second drive would slow either one down, as long as you jumper the drive correctly (probably both will be jumpered cs) then it will use udma 5 and you will get optimal performance. 
to use raid you need to have identical size drives. 
to use raid 0 you need to start with 2 new drives and build the os from the beginning, you can't just add a 2nd drive and raid them together. 
if you use raid 0 and either drive dies you lose all data on both drives.
