does anyone have any opinion; good or bad about an hp pavilion a815y or an a815n? 
also for someone like myself who isn't a gamer; will be using a new desktop pc strictly for email; web surfing; personal finances; and word processing could i get by with a machine that has both integrated video as well as integrated sound?
