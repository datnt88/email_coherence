unless you have a game *now* that you can't play *now*, you'll be better off doing your upgrade in a few months. 
intel will be refreshing the core2duo line, ati's dx10 gpus will be out, and nvidia will fill out its 8xxxx series. 
for the money you've got budgeted, you'll probably be able to get a 8800gtx class gpu and a e6600 class cpu if you wait 3-4 months. 
your 7900gs is a very good card for 1280x1024. 
other cards may give higher frame rates, but the 7900gs will still make most games highly playable. 
so if have to spend money now, i suggest you get the core2duo. 
wait for crysis to be released and benchmarked before you upgrade your video card.
