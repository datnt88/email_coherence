burn cd-r's at any lower speed if desired, your software gives you that option. 
for cd-rw's it is slightly different in that the media has a limited range of speeds that they should be burned at. the range is normally on the package. 
disks can be flawed by being unbalanced during mfg. 
seems that the biggest cause is that the center hub gets a miniscule crack in it when removing it from the jewel case. 
then at the high speed the crack propogates. 
on major mfr refuses to make 52 x media because of the problem.
