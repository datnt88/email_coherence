it appears your kybd's &quot;r&quot; has gotten stick or broke, even it works now and then. 
it's not surprising to find some issue with an older laptop won't crop-up. the whole kybd. 
can be replaced, if you're capable. 
i suppled a link in case you want to review that and many others once you google. 
you can try a usb kybd. 
and see if allowed as an ext. 
kybd. 
access or secondary human interface device for possible quick fix.
