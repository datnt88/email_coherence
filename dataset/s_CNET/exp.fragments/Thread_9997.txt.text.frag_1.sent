i am currently using a laptop with integrated nvidia geforce 7000m / nforce 610m, adapter ram 64.00 mb. how can i upgrade the graphics? 
or can i change the graphic card? 
i came across this nvidia forceware 182.50 whql vista. 
it is said to improve graphics. 
does this actually work? 
what other ways can i improve my graphics?
