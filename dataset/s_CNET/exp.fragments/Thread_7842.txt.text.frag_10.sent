when you boot your computer up,does it show what version of bios your system uses?it should be at the top left hand side,though it may differ from computer to computer.do 
you know if it is a phoenix or award bios?it is possible that if you get the correct bios for that specific computer,that you can put a new bios in it.but 
be warned,if you put the wrong bios in it then your computer will never function again,and your mobo will basically be dead.
