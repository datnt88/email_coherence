you didn't mention what type of kybd. 
connection you have, usb or std. 
ps/2 or any of its traits. 
it matters as usb tend to freak out as they're serviced like any other attached device under the os. while the ps/2 is a more dedicated one based on h/w. 
check the bios for kybd. 
buffer and/or similar label. 
to quickly test the kybd. 
swap it out and check results. 
kybds., do fail or become flaky from wear&tear. 
also, if this is somewhat battery operated, replace with new one. 
you can turn the kybd. 
over and &quot;burp it&quot; by rapping it backside to loosen any crud or possible metal object(staple) lodged inside.
