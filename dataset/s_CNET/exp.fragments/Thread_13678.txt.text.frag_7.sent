are more than usual. 
sata came out long after windows 2000 so you need to research not only if you can fit the sata card but if that card has drivers for windows 2000. 
as to the usb 2.0 it's under 1/2 the speed of ide. 
this is why it didn't meet your criteria. 
but since it's just nearline storage why would it matter? 
i use mine and can play music, video just fine. 
why such a hard criteria on speed?
