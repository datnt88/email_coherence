i have an extensive network set up between 3 sites and am having some issues now that we have added more sites in. 
we have one site with the internet connection router to wirless bridge to bridge via ad-hoc connection. 
from there we have a switch connecting to another bridge via ad-hoc to the next bridge to a switch, and this is where we run into the problem. 
we can hit the internet at the first two sites but the last cannot get on the internet. 
the last site can ping, stream video from the main router at site one but unable to connect to internet. 
any ideas? 
we have checked gateways on all bridges computers. 
we set up a laptop at site one and connected no issues, the took it to site three and was unable to connect to internet. is there some limit on ad-hoc jumps, or are we missing something. 
any inputs would be helpful.
