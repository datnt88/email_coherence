here is the short of it 1) my pc froze. 
2) i rebooted because it would not respond. 
3) i received &quot;boot disk failure load system disk&quot;. 
4) i selected repair in the windows xp home edition setup menu. 
5) i received the message &quot;setup did not find any hard disk drives&quot; i moved the hard disk drive to another pc and it booted from the drive in question just fine so this problem is not my hard drive. 
i attempted to reload windows xp using a new sata cable and a new hard disk and i received the same messages described above. 
i tried this install using all 4 sata ports and had the same errors. 
i am thinking maybe a bad sata controller on my msi amd motherboard? 
any ideas?
