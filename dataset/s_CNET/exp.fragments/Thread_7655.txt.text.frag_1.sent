i want to purchase a new all in one printer (fax not necessary) for a student. 
i want the student to be able to print wirelessly or by attaching usb cable to her macbook notebook. 
i have read some reviews on cnet that state you cannot have both conditions in operation at same time - reviews of canon mp620 (the printer i am interested in) revealed the following comments. 
a more troublesome issue is that you have to set the printer to connect by either wireless or wired network. 
allowing both is not an option. 
that means you can't have the printer set to work on a wired network, and then connect to it with an adhoc wireless connection from, say, your notebook, on an occasional basis. 
are there any all in one printers that allow both wired and wireless hookup? 
i do not need fax capability.
