1. this is my computer: is it possible to keep my processor, dvd drives, hard drives, etc. and simply upgrade the motherboard? 
i'd like to get one that has an agp or pci-e slot to upgrade my vid card... 2. i'm also looking at a new dvd burner, one that will support dvd-ram. 
it may seem like a silly question, but will a drive like this read dvd-ram as well? 
reason i ask is that i have a hitachi dvd camcorder that won't connect to my computer. 
i'd like to just take my dvd-ram discs from it and plop them into a drive on my pc to transfer them. 
will this work? 
thanks, eric
