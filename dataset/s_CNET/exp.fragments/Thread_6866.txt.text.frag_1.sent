i have a maxtor one touch 200gb external hard drive that has given me some issues. 
i use it primarily on my laptop, a dell latitude d610. 
now, i started having problems when i tried to access certain folders in the drive. 
i would double-click them, and my computer (i sound like an idiot, but whatever you call the thing you browse your hard drive with) froze up. 
this happened repeatedly and consistently. 
i was told to run a disk check (chkdsk or whatever), and many sections were found to be 'unreadable.' finally, i formatted the entire hard drive, since i couldn't access anything on there anyway. 
now, at least from some initial testing, it seems to work fine. 
however, i barely have anything on it at the moment, so the problem could still be there. 
anyone know what is going on? 
i'm kind of a newb, so feel free to remind me if i've forgotten to include anything.
