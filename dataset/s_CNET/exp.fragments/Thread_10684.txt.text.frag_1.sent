i have recently bought a sharp lc20b6e lcd tv with pc input. 
i have no problems using it with my pc but whenever i try to play a game just as it loads up the screen goes blank and the message &quot;please check pc input&quot; appears. 
i have tried changing resolutions but this has no effect and i know there can be problems playing pc games on a lcd tv, but is there any way round this? 
thanks for an help or suggestions!
