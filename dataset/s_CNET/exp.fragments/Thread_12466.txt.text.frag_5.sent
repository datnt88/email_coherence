thanks, my monitor had some problem. 
i have called the samsung service engineer they have detected some problem in pcb kit ( in sweep circuit probably). 
i will get it back may be in a week. 
now i am using a dell monitor but is not supporting counter strike czero. 
pixels are getting missaligned and colour contrast is also bad
