i agree with what was said here. 
i looked at many packages, none seemed to have quite what i wanted, building my own(with some help from a tech friend) taught me a fair bit and i am now a lot more confident about future re-builds. 
it did'nt really save me money, i shopped around a lot on the net and at computer fairs, but i enjoyed it and do now understand more about what goes on inside a computer.
