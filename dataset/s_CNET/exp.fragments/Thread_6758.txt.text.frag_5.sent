&quot;it gives a question mark in the device managed, saying there`s no drivers, even though they`ve been installed correctly&quot; this is often the result of plugging in a device before the drivers were installed. 
let's not debate this point, but move forward to the usual remedy. 
when you see those &quot;?&quot; 
mark items, use the device manager to remove them. 
then unplug the phone and do not plug it back in. 
now install the drivers for the phone. 
and then try again. 
if it doesn't work, you'll have to tell us the url of said phone and drivers so we can check these are for xp. bob
