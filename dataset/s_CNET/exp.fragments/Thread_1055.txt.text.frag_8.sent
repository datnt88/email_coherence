can you draw a diagram that shows the layout of your lan. 
just a simple lan diagram. 
use mspaint to draw it in. 
what's the square footage of your house? is it a single or two floors? 
how many walls between the router and the farthest wireless you will be using? 
do a second diagram with floor plan so i have a good understanding of your layout. 
just a quick drawing, nothing fancy. 
email it to me at philbernie@yahoo.com. 
i would love to help you out.
