i'm pretty sure the old win98 could go up to win2000 (if i still have system disks for that version somewhere). 
not that there are that many programs left that run on 2000 either probably. 
we just kept it around at win98 to run some old programs, and it is the trusty back-up everytime the new ones crash and burn - it always works! 
one of the two hard drives had to be replaced when it was 18 months old - no other problems since then. 
it is the indestructable beast - built in a local computer shop in tucson, it has outlasted 3 newer workstations (2 dells and a hp) - that is why i thought it could withstand 4 year olds. 
if i knew a good computer repair place around here i'd buy a used xp, but i'm in a small town and have not been impressed with the one i know in town - their used computers are really overpriced. 
that is why if i don't use the win98, i'm looking for something new but cheap for the kids- i'm probably going to have to buy on-line.
