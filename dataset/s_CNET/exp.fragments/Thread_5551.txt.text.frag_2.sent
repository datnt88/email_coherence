if your setup allows boot from other, network or scsi then you should be able to do so. 
don't believe you can boot from usb. 
i could be wrong but believe usb is loaded following boot to allow for hot swapping. 
there is no reason the ide connects cannot be routed to a rear connector and a hard drive placed in an enclosure with separate power. 
everything internal will need to be exactly the same as i'm sure you are aware.
