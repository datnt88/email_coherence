i was wondering if i can make my external hard drive use the same drive every time i plug it in, for example drive g: or anything like that, every time i unplug it and plug it back in, it turns into i different drive, and then i have to delete all my music off of itunes, and reinstall them, for them to play, since i have all my music on my external hard drive, thanks in advance.
