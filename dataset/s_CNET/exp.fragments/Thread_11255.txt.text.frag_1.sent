i have installed in this system md-x58i i7 xfx motherboard with triple chanel nb. on one set (3) i have corsair 1333 patriot 1.65v works fine and bios reports 1066 (or whatever#) good. 
now i add another set of corsair 1333 1.5v no boot unless i set the memory freq. 
to x06 which then reports from bios 800mhz when running cpu-z i get about 398mhz for each ram stick. 
now i read that tripple chanel will devide by 3 the nb but why does the bios set at 800mhz? 
strange system running stable but seems slower than when there is 6gb instead of 12gb if you want to see the cpu-z screen shots i can email them to you any advise would be greatly appreciated this system is driving me insane thanks danielo@bmts.com
