do not attempt to reboot your system with the bad drive. 
wait for your new drive to arrive and fully installed to try this, 1. on new drive create a folder called &quot;bad drive&quot; 2. slave the bad drive to the new drive. 
3. if the bad drive will spin up, copy/paste folders &quot;my doucments and &quot;program files&quot; (location of most files) from bad drive to &quot;bad drive&quot; folder located on new drive. the above proceedure has a 50-50 chance of working. 
do not attempt to locate the files you want. 
do that after you have them on the new drive. the longer the bad drive has to spin the sooner failure will occur. 
if it hasn't already. 
good luck bill
