bob, thanks for your reply. 
both computers i have used do have usb 2.0 cards. 
i installed one of them (the device manager shows an enhanced controller for usb), and the other is a new computer that a friend of mine has and does operate as a 2.0 for other devices that he uses. 
i am using the cable that was sent with the hard drive so i'm still puzzled about this problem.
