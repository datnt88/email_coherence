so i am better off just getting a new pc solely for the purpose of watching hd movies off the internet. 
what type of pc would i be able to buy at a reasonable price that has the capabilities i am looking for? the reason i am doing this is to save money. 
i have gone through 4 dvd players in a year and they keep breaking, i dont know why. if buying a pc with all the components is going to cost an arm and a leg then that defeats the purpose. 
if i can find one at a reasonable price than i will still consider it. 
i bought this lcd tv assuming that it was going to have &quot;amazing quality picture&quot; but it is only slightly better than my other tv i bought over ten years ago. 
a thousand dollars later, and i still have lower end of technology. 
sometimes i just feel like giving up. 
i have never even downloaded a torrent before. 
is this idea even realistic?
