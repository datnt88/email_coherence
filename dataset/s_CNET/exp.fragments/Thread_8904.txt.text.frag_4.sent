thanks guys, if it were for my personal use i'd take your offers, but this is for a customer who would expect a brand new product, not used. 
i did find an internal scsi drive from adtron which uses compact flash media ( ), but i need an external drive. 
i looked for a drive enclosure for scsi, but all are either ide, usb or sata. the scsi drive enclosures i saw were not the right form factor ... bummer.
