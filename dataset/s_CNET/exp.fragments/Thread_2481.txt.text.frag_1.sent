hello guys im having a problem with my amd athlon xp 3200+ it should be able to run at 2.2ghz, but at the moment its only running at 1.8ghz... this is the manual for my motherboard: i have 1gb or corsair ram, pc2700. 
250hd. 
bfg tech geforce 6800gs 256mb. 
windows xp home. 
heres a pic of my processor info taken with cpu-z: (its showing as an 2500+ becuase its running at 1.8 ghz, the same speed as a 2500+) in my motherboard manual, it says that it can support upto an amd xp 3200 so i dont know what the problem is. 
any help would be great, thanks. 
im running pc2700 ram, my motherboard can support pc3200, but on in 2 slots.
