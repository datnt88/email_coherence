hmm.. so evry wifi extender/booster device means a different ssid, rite? 
that means, my wifi client (eg: laptop) would theoritically discover multiple wifi networks/ssid in the house - obviously, the upstream one would appear weaker than the downstream one... hmm! by the way, should the wifi booster be placed in an area with strong signal to extend the coverage or can it be placed some place where the signal is already weak?
