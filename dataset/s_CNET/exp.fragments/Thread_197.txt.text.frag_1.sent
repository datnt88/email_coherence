i have a western digital 300 gb external hard drive we use as a media center. it is full of music, movies, and tv shows. 
i went to listen to some music and a message said i need to format the drive. 
i know formatting will erase everything. 
i cannot do that. 
how can i get it to work or at least save everything i have
