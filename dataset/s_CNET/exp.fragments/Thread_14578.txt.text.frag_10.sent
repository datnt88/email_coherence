i'm sorry -- i took your &quot;best of luck&quot; heading as a sign-off. 
-- i have service pack 2. -- i'm using the second plug on the ide cable already connected to the factory installed hard drive. 
-- jumper setting is per the drive manufacturer's instruction manual for a slave. 
-- i checked for an updated driver for the disk, but there's no newer one available. 
let me know if you need more. 
thanks for your help.
