windows explorer only shows partitioned drives. 
is that second drive partitioned? 
you need to go to the disk management tool in the control panel under administrative functions/computer management. 
it's possible xp sees it as unpartitioned space. 
you'd need to click on it and follow the prompts to partition and format it. 
once done, it gets a drive letter and explorer can see it.
