peachtree complete accounting. 
suddenly would not load.tried 
restoring to prior date used, no luck. 
went back to a restore point a month earlier. 
still no luck finally wound up reinstalling the original software, as a new company (using our same company name). 
that faked it out and i was able to do a peachtree &quot;restore&quot; from my flash drive backup file. 
it loaded my most recently saved data and i was back in business. 
i have other issues with peactree. 
i may look for help through cnet to help resolve administrator and &quot;read only&quot; files problems.
