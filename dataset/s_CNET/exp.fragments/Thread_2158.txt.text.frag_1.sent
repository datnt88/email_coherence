hi everyone, newbie here. 
i'd like to get a wireless webcam so i don't have to have my computer on all the time to have the cam running. 
if i get a wireless webcam can i view a stream of what is going on in my house from somewhere else or do i need to have server space somewhere else first? 
i'm leaving on a vacation soon so i'd like to set one up asap if possible. 
thanks!
