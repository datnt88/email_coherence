ok i am a novice when it comes to computers so i need some advice on building my first pc. 
so let me get straight to nitty..... i decided to build a pc because i was told (and i heard) that it would be cheaper than buying a mac (the industry type). 
i want to build a computer which will be great for multitasking in graphic design, music production, music recording, mixing, editing and etc. (i wont be playing any games on it). 
now the question at hand is, which intel or amd processor is the best price to performance ratio for this kind of make? 
as for a budget...not more than $2000. 
and secondly can anyone recommend a case and a motherboard to go along with that specific processor?
