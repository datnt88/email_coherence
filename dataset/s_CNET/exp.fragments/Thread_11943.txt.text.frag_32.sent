yes it applies to xp pro. 
i think that it's not possible for me to fix this one. 
with most posts you came so close to performing a step but then changed it slightly. 
drop the firewall, but unplug the internet. 
rather than create an user you renamed one. 
at this point it's time to enable the guest account and you don't do that but want more about networking. 
sorry but access control in the item noted is for shares whether it be files or printers. 
i'm going to be absent for a while so let's hope you find out what caused this not to work. 
i wonder why we can't accomplish steps without small changes but that's your choice. 
next week i'll have to try that account rename but that will have to wait.
