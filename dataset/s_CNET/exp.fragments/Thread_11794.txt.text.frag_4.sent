i read your first post and it reads as if you want to access your blu ray from other places, same about the games. 
this is a no go area or rather all the copy protections and more mean we can't use our blu ray and games from other places in the house with any reliable, published, you and i can set it up with stuff i bought at the usual store solution. 
your reply however seems to have the usual question about how to get the internet to these devices. 
that's been done many many times. 
-&gt; since wifi seems to fail you and we know n promises more but doesn't always deliver why not the usual power line hd bridge?
