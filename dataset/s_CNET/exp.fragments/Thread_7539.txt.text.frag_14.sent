well this may help explain. 
not sure what it means but i think i need a new drive. 
i did a pre boot test in bios (diagnostics) when the cd rom was tested it returned a &quot;spindle test failed&quot; result. 
error code: 2000-0147 so looks like it is in fact time for new drive unless someone has a tip on how to fix that. 
thanks!
