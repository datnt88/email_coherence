for all my cd/cd-rw/dvd/dvd burners i have only gone with lite-on. 
very fast. 
reliable. 
however if you want an extremly silent computer, sometimes these can be a little noisy when loading extreme amounts of data. 
not too loud, because i can tolerate it. 
try this one and see if it is what you are looking for: tyler
