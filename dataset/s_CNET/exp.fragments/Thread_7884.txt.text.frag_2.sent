here's why. 
i have an all too similar system that peaks out at 165 watts on the ac meter (i have a watt meter.) so that gives you a 50 percent load on the 400 watt psu. 
if you load up the machine with much more i'd shop for a new psu if you ever suffer random reboots. 
in closing ask the supplier that the motherboard be supplied with the current bios version f7 so you don't have to learn why.
