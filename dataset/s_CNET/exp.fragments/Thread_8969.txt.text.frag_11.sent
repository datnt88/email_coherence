while in the process of installing windows on a new build, i had several drives blue screen. 
when that happens, i immediately wipe/reformat the hard-drive and restart the installation. 
my experience has been that a stable install usually goes onto a clean drive. 
plus, wipe drive will not work on a disk that has serious errors--i have few tech tools and troubleshoot the old-fashioned way, one component at a time.
