about the bios, i don't know what your talking about, newbie here. 
anyway, the hdd didn't fail. the problem is that since opening the case and un-plugging the hdd, it hasn't worked. 
i doubt it was a coincidence that the drive failing the second we openned it, because it was making loud noise all month.
