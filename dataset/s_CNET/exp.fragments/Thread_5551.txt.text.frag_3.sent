i've yet to see winxp pro boot from an usb 2.0 drive. 
it's not supported. 
what is done is drive racks. 
then the drive is removable. 
what make put the kabosh on windows xp is that it's activation may kick in on each hard disk and you'll need a license for each install of windows xp. this could add some expense you were not expecting. 
do investigate this. 
dell has supplied drive racks for years.
