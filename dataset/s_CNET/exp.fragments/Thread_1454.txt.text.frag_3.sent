thank you, but that doesn't exactly answer my question... like i said i have no problem backing up what is on my lacie. 
what i'm asking is how i can reformat it once i have everything i want off, or if that will even help the issue. 
you mention my &quot;apple app for formatting it fresh&quot;. 
what is that? 
i'm not complaining about losing files, i would just prefer not having to spend $100 on a new one if i didn't have to. 
thanks again.
