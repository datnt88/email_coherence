hey this has had me thinking for quite a while now so was wondering what other people think. 
i have left all power saving options for my hard disk off, e.g. &quot;turn off hard disks after 2 hours&quot; etc. the theory behind this was that it causes more wear and tear on the hd if it powers off and starts again then when it idles, however i'm just not sure of this. 
now my pc is on 24/7 and most of the time it has ftp running and downloads going on, so hd activity is mostly active anyway, but my second hd is sometimes idle. 
what does everyone else think? 
thanks!
