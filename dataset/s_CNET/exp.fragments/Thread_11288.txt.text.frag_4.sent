they have better communication between the two cpu's by far. 
however the situation is so dynamic and intel is a far biger company than amd, yopu can be sure that they will very shortly have equal or better. 
by putting the mch [memory controller hub] inside the cpu [a great idea] amd unfortunately locked themselves into ddr memory. 
thus they are frantically working on a new set of cpus that will support ddr2 and possiblly something newer, [they just signed an agreement with another memory developer]. 
thus it will be a different socket type and thus a different mobo. 
one shouldn't make a decision until they have money in hand and ready to place the order. 
then on that day you buy the greatest and a month later it is the old slow one. 
lol keep up by going to and [as well as others] and read the test that they present regarding such things. 
fantastic source of current info.
