hmmm...not sure about the beeping pattern. 
but i'll open it up, reseat the memory and see how it goes. 
thanks for your help, i really appreciate it. 
one more question - if i figure out what memory cards are faulty - what's the best place to get them replaced? 
do i have to deal with dell directly or can i go to best buy, for example, and get? 
thanks again.
