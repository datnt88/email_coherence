hello john, &gt;also most servers have dual nics in them. the number of nics in a machine depends on what you're doing with it. 
sometimes all you need is one. 
&gt;i assume that you have a t1 line. 
my connection will be 758k upstream initially. 
that should suffice for the first year or so. 
&gt;you could upgrade to an amd64 dual core later on. 
yes a dual processor would be better. 
i'm contemplating setting up a server farm as suggested by rob. 
i'll see if my budget can support multiprocessor machines. 
&gt;if i were doing this i would put the os on a seprate hd from the raid data drives, but thats just me. 
please shed more light on this. 
what are the advantages of doing this?
