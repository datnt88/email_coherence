the machine was my daughter's before she died. 
i understand that she had replaced several of the ink cartridges. 
i have it sitting on a table and it's only plugged in to an electrical outlet. 
i do have the owner's manual but i haven't found the setup cd that, undoubtedly, came with it when she bought it. 
i would be very grateful if somebody could help me out a little or point me in the proper direction. 
- - - - - - - - - - the machine tells me, &quot;pls open cover&quot; i open the cover and it tells me, &quot;cover open. 
pls close cover,&quot; which i do. 
then it repeats itself - over & over. 
i have opened both covers, and i cannot see any paper nor any foreign objects on the inside. 
- - - - - - - - - - somebody please help. 
thanx don d
