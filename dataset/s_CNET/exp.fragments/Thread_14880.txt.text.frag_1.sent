here's the setup, older dell optiplex, 40g hd, i have added a second 40g, the original,(drive c) only has about 1.5g of room left, the other i took out of another dead machine, formatted and hooked up as a slave (drive f). (as there is no os, on it). 
here is what i want to do, when downloading a new program, or well when saving anything the machine automatically defaults to drive c. i want to either change the registry, or whatever so that it defaults to drive f. as right now i have two files called &quot;my documents&quot;, and two &quot;program files&quot;. 
but i would really rather just seperate the two ie...drive c, contain the program files, drive f everything else. 
but i am fine with having two sets of files, i just keep forgetting to change the c to an f when saving stuff, then i have to move it to f. the question is, what is the best (read that the easiest), thing to do? 
or is it possiable to seperate the program files, and everything else? 
once i know what to do, i need to know how to do it. 
any suggestions?
