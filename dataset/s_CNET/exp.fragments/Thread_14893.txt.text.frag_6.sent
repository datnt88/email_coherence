i've been doing research that suggests an amd with hypertransport is twice as fast as an intel with qpi. because the buses are always the slowest part this is an important component to my project. 
which of the front-side bus replacements would be the best upgrade? 
also, i've switched to a xeon e5-2690 for the intel build. 
now both cpus have 8-cores. the question boils down to: intel 8-core w/64gb ram and qpi vs amd 8-core w/32gb ram and ht?
