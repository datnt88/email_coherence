there will be two interfaces involved but, if you buy a packaged external drive, you need only deal with one. the drive in the external inclosure will have an interface that connects to the drive itself. 
most of these are ide. the enclosure itself will connect to your pc via a cable. 
these are generally usb or firewire but some are sata. 
your pc just needs a matching port. 
do you know if you have an available usb or firewire port? 
if so, get an external that plugs into it and don't worry about the drive to enclosure interface. 
hope that helps.
