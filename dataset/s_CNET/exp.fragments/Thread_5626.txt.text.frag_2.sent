in loading w2k, did you also go to compaq (ne. 
hp) and download the latest drivers, especially bios for w2k. 
if the w2k was not supplied by compaq, you cannot rely on microsoft alone to support your system. 
just loading w2k and driver updates will not always do the trick. 
my experience with compaq workstations, armad laptops and a presario or two. 
i use w2k and have almost always had to get something from the compaq/hp driver/software downloads.
