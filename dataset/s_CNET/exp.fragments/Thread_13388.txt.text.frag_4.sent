provided the restore feature of xp or vista was turned on, you can use a &quot;restore point&quot; to back a day or two, select *one* from the list. 
under xp: goto start-&gt;pgms-&gt;accessories-&gt;system tools-&gt;system restore-&gt;follow prompts. 
now pick a date that makes sense, like a day before the problem occurred. 
if vista very similar. 
google for restore point to understand this feature. 
don't use a resotre disk or recovery disk to reload the system. 
i hope i made this clear. 
good luck -----willy
