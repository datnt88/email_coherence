robert, have you checked to see if any other programs are running in the background that might be hogging the system either by using memory or the cpu or both? 
also, click ctrl-alt_del and click the services tab. 
click the cpu tab twice to bring the running services to the top and see if any unwanted or unnecessary services are running. 
i don't think it is the card but i am not sure.
