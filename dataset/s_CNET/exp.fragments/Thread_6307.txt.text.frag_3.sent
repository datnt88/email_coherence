if you connect your external to a router, it's attached to a network (a small network, consisting of your nexus and that router). 
that is what we call network attached storage, or nas shortly. 
so, if your external can be connected to the router, you already have nas. 
and if it doesn't it won't work. 
but i see the nexus 7 has a usb-port. 
and most externals i know (unless they are firewire of e-scsi) can connect via usb. 
so why do you think you need a router?
