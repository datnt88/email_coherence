im making a small ftp server using serv-u. 
i have an ip and a domain and i set up serv-u with it. 
when i try to log in from a different computer, i get a 401 authorization required screen. 
i checked the settings over and over. 
now when i try to log in, the sign in window just keeps popping up. 
any ideas?
