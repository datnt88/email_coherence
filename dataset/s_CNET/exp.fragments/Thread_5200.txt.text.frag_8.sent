i go by machines not going wrong in the first place, or not having obvious faults, as a measure of quality and certainly what is 'best'. 
that the hardware is readily replaced by the manufacturer is not a measure of such to me, especially as it means downtime for any reason - diagnostics, visit to the apple store, etc. i have spare machines but they are for emergencies (and for the other non-apple machines i have as spares, they are), and not for what seems like almost routine use (in the case of apple hardware). 
i of course acknowledge that people who do nothing particularly critical or worthwhile on their computers might feel otherwise. 
i suppose this is what richard dawkins feels like when he's talking to a fundamentalist christian...
