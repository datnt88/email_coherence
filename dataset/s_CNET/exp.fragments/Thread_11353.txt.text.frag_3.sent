there are many tools like the one mentioned above but it must run on each pc. 
what you need is a device that can monitor all the pc. the only common point you have is the router or the connection to the isp. 
you could buy what is called a tap and place it on the cable between the isp and the router. 
you would then run wireshark and capture the traffic. 
wireshark has good reporting but can be tricky since it has many option. 
although simple to setup it is not a cheap way to do this. the method i would recommend even though it too is not free. 
replace your router with a router that can run the open firmware called dd-wrt, mostly linksys. 
then run the tool called rflow collector. 
this is very similar to a feature called netflow used in commercial routers. 
there are good instructions on how to set this up but it is still fairly complex. 
it is fairly easy to get instantaneous data and some router/firewall will display open sessions to get historic type data you need to store the information and routers cannot do that.
