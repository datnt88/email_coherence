ok that is helpful thank you! our modem connects up to 8 devices to the network at the same time (albeit rarely more than 4) on all platforms and using both ethernet and wireless. 
i wouldn't to slow it down. 
also, if i don't need one, what kind of people do? 
i see them in ads all of the time but we were provided a modem from at&t and when it broke could only buy a replacement that was of a specific model at best buy. 
are routers if you don't get a modem for free? 
and if routers do not speed up the network, then do they make more bandwidth, increase range, or just support faster networks (depending on 802.11 a/b/g/n or whatever the router is)? 
thank you!
