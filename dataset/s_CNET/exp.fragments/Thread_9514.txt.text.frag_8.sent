hi scott, first, if you hit start, run, then type msconfig &quot;enter&quot; you will get a screen whose last tab (startup) lists most (not all) apps that start with windows. 
do not remove anything you aren't sure you don't need, but remove what you can. 
i have found a utility that allows you to proscribe the sequecnce of apps that start, and how much delay between. 
it is &quot;startup faster&quot; and i believe i got it from c/net's download site. 
i found that being logical, like starting wi-fi before starting apps that go out on the internet speeds things up dramatically. 
hope this helps, paul
