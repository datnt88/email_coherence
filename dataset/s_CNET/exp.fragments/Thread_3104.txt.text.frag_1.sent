hi, a couple of days ago my computer was working happily, then i left it for a few hours, came home and it had died! if i unplug and plug it in again the orange led on the mobo lights up for a few seconds, the lights on the keyboard flash and the case fan twitches and thats it. 
although the psu would be my first suspect its a $$ 550w thats only a few months old. the mobo and processor are both 2.5 yrs old and are the only original components i have kept in there since i built it - everything else has been upgraded. 
could one of them have blown/died? 
i have inspected the mobo & all components and there is no smells, damage etc. is it possible that if the mobo goes it could blow the psu? 
system: mobo: gigabite ga7-vaxp, 756ddr, xp1800. 
thanks very much.
