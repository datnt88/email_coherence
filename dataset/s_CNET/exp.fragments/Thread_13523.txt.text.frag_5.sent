nope, all this took place in the space of a few hours. 
see, i was going to have a friend over to watch the shows with me. 
when i started one of them to see if everything was fine and it didnt work, i freaked out. 
i happen to be one of those people who leave their computer on continuously. 
i have read that starting up is the most stressful thing a hard drive can do, so i thought i was doing my system a service by leaving it on continuously. 
how exactly is windows not made for continuous running? 
i thought the only time windows needed to reboot was when a program was installed.
