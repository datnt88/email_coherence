i don't have any detail to work with here. 
we do know that hiding the ssid and more can break wifi on some devices. 
your post has so little detail that i can't tell if it's something we know about. 
to help others we have the top posts over in the cnet networking forum and a post specific to samsung devices. 
tell more and if you can't change the router settings, i need to know that so we can stop before we start.
