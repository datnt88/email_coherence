ok get this i called hp back and asked about the analog connections in the front of the media center and how to get it working. 
i gave them all the serial numbers and model first the lady try to tell me that the connections arent real. 
i told her im starring right at it i finally got her to look on there own website and see that the connections are real. 
then she try to tell me that i need a device that would change my analog from analog to digital then back to analog again then send it to the analog connection on the media center. then i showed her on there website where it say you can capture video directly from analog devices such as vcr, or analog camcorder then she wanted to charge me $65.00 to talk to someone who would be able to tell me how the ports (that she said werent real) work.
