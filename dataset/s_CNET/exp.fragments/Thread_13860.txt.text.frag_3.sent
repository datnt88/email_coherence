if the hdcp can't be verified (sorry, i hope you will google what new terms are as i won't duplicate that here) then the display should fall back to sdtv resolution or &quot;480p.&quot; the fix is to connect with vga and forget hdmi. 
you could get a video card with hdmi output that is certified to output hdcp compliante hdmi but my bet is that would run a bit more cash and involve the vista os. bob
