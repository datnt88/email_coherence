one week ago i set up the belkin 54mbps wireless router as per the instuctions to my home office lan. it worked perfectly for 3 days, routing both the wired lan and wirless access to my two laptops - ibm t42 and sony viao 505. then after 3 days both laptops ceased to be able to access wirelessly [while the wired network continues to work fine]. 
both laptops recognize the wireless network - they just can't connect to it. the ibm says the signal is too weak - even when i put it right next to the router. the sony does not give a reason. 
i have: 1. replaced the router with a new one from the store and reinstalled it - no help. 
2. turned off the ibm automatic access software - no help. 
3. tried to reconnect everyway i can think of. 
i am completely stimied. 
thanks for reading this. 
any ideas?
