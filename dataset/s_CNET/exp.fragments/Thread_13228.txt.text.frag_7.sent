i had that wicked problem a few months back. 
first off, the ethernet card, nic, in the pc: is it internal or is it on a pci card. 
maybe try switching. 
i had to get a cheap nic for pci 'cause my internal one died on me. 
also: do you have floresceunet (the spelling fairy is going to kill me) light bulbs? 
i had the weirdest thing happen. 
with the lights on: the modem would work, with the lights off it would not. 
a pain, and a high electric bill. 
i ended up moving the pc. ~ibrahim~
