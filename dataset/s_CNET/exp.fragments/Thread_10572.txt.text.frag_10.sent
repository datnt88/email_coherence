i bought 2 of these monitors in september 2005. 
one went bad within 30 days. 
hyundai replaced it. 
in february the replacement and the other original monitor went bad. 
all three of the monitors have the same problem of vertical lines on the right hand side of the machine. 
i am still waiting to find out if they are going to charge me shipping for the replacements.
