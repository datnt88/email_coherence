i'm so used to going to best buy for stuff, cause its close, and i don't have to wait 3 days...i didn't bother to think about new egg or tiger direct.....but i will check on that. the bios - i'll have to get back to you guys on....the manuals say zero about the speeds....blah... btw, i accidentally pasted the same link twice.. is the mainboard info is the ram info for those who might be interested
