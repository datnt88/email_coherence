hi i have a cable modem gateway that works on wifi g now. the problem i have is at 100% power i only can get 45~50% signal on my notebook two rooms away. 
i plan to get a desktop on wifi g and one of them new wifi gaming system due out next year. 
i was looking at the d-link dgl-4300 gaming router. 
it looks like it's got a lot of power and range? 
than most other router of it's kind? is this as good as it looks? 
i like the 108mbps power and the gigabit stuff. 
or can you think of a better router certified by wifi? 
thank you for your help and time.
