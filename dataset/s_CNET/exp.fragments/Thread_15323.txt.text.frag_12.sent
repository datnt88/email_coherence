i also have an emachine t6420 that died just shy of two years. 
very frustrating. 
i contacted gateway and the tech agreed that emachines is not a good product and they are replacing them. 
it sounds as if emachines was selling defective computers. 
let me know if this turns into a class action suit. 
thanks.
