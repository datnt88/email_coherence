thank you all for your contributions, but i feel i need to clarify my situation, so here are my components, or what i hope they will be: - cpu: amd phenom ii x4 955 or higher processor ($120-$140) - motherboard: msi 880gm-e43 ($80 -$20 mir) or msi 870u-g55 ($90 -$20 mir) - ram: corsair 6gb tri channel xms3 ddr3 ram ($53) - gpu: have an evga geforce 8400gs 1gb card already, and once i upgrade, i'm pretty sure i can get my hands on a nvidia geforce gt420 for a small sum of money - hdd: planning on using my old 120 gb hard drive until its served as long as it will. 
- os: opting to use a copy of windows xp professional, as i am more than hesitant to upgrade to vista or 7. - case: if an upgrade to the psu is necessary, i will probably spring for a thermaltake v3 black edition ($45 - $10 mir) - psu: if necessary, something like an antec basiq 500w would probably do the trick ($50 -$10 mir) (that is, assuming 500w will adequately supply my components. 
fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads total:$348-$378, before a total of $40 in rebates. 
again, this computer will be used for only a light to moderate amount of gaming and 3d modeling, mainly to get me started on a more high-performing computer setup. 
tell me what you think, and thanks again for all the advice.
