epson now has printers out (the &quot;c&quot; series&quot;) that have chipped ink cartridges. 
however, there are &quot;ink refill&quot; web sites that sell a chip that goes on the refillable cartridges that &quot;trick&quot; the printer in to thinking there is always a new or full ink cartridge. 
check it out. 
pretty nifty. 
i think or are just two of those sites. 
i have four epsons and it is great to be able to refill them. 
plus, i have two lexmarks (z23 and z611). 
i just snap the tops off, refill and tape the tops down. 
refill kits show how - can buy them at walmart..
