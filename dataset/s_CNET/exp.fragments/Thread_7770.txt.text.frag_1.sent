i have an older notebook and the hard drive is giving some problems. 
i am considering buying an external usb portable hard drive and cloning the notebook drive to the ext.drive (bootable) before the drive totally fails. 
i will mainly use the notebook for non hd tv streaming and older gaming where the increased drive speed may be helpful. 
i thought the external drive could be used as a backup for my other notebook when the older notebook finally dies. 
my older notebook has xp, 512 mb ram , intel pen-m 735 &amp; ati mobility radeon 9600/9700.for 
a limited techie like me, when switching on the old computer how do i stop the computer using the old drive and use the external drive on a permanent basis ? 
would it be wise to remove the old drive? 
are there any other potential problems?generally 
does increasing ram improve effectiveness of tv streaming ?many 
thanks for any help offered.
