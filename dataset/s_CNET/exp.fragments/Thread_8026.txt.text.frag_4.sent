link up computer/router by ethernet cable. 
go start, all programs, accessories, command prompt at the black and white screen type ipconfig /all this will show you the ip address of all connections including the gateway which whould be the address of the router. 
failing that you could press reset button on router to get it to revert to factory default ip address -- but this may default all other settings in the router too.
