too bad i don't live/work in the uk. plextor has a write protect hdd available to europeans. 
it is not available in the usa. 
i've already looked. 
i wish it was. 
i even contacted plextor to try and find out what it would take to get some here. the guy on the phone was a real smartass about it and wouldn't lookup any contact info for anyone in the company that would actually know something.
