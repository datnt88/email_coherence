i was hoping for a different answer. 
i've got the same story: the computer worked perfectly out of the box. 
i installed and transferred numerous files. 
then, after configuring the new computer, i can no longer access wirelessly. 
of course my old computer is now being used by somebody else, after reformatting the hard drive. 
after also spending hours with ibm help, ibm has sent me a box to ship them the computer back under warranty. 
but, sometimes i can use the same computer on my wireless network at work without any problem. 
however, some times when hitting the &lt;funtion} f5 button (which should toggle the wireless radio on and off), the system doesn't even show i have a wireless radio! 
i don't have any confidence in the ibm warranty, and i really don't want to be without my new computer for weeks. 
isn't there a better solution?
