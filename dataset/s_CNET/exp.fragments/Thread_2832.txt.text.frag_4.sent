that is a great solution to jmf4x9 question. 
i have not thought of using a refurbished pc as a htpc. 
from what you described it had to have either on-board graphics or a graphics card. 
kudoos, great solution at a great price. 
i will use your idea on using a d-link wireless g pci card thanks for your post
