thanks for the input, vapcmd, i have been reading the forum and find that most folks use the terms imaging and cloning interchangeably, while other draw a distinction - apparently cloning software creates a bootable cd in case pc crashes and won't boot. 
does the imaging software you use allow you to create a bootable cd or floppy?
