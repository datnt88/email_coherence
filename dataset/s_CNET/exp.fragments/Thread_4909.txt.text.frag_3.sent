as robert stated, the signal strength is weaken due to a &quot;multiple/broken link&quot; this effect is also found in extended cabling. 
either buy a &quot;high quality&quot; cable, gold tipped or adapters specificily offered/recommended by the vendor of your projector. 
i'm not that into projector and stuff but found this issue with large monitors and ext. 
cables.
