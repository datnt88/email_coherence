yes, my wife and i both would occasionaly need to be online. 
i will probably go ahead and add more memory but leave the win98 operating system on the desktop. 
i want to leave the desktop where it is, i have a flatbed scanner (which i use often) and a printer hooked up to it. the laptop i would like to be able to use wireless throughout the house.
