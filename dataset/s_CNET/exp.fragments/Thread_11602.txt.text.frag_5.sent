since all i'm asking about and all i want to do is provide internet to my non-wireless equipped home computer using my verizon mobile broadband device i'm wondering why i can't just buy a usb wireless adaptor and plug this into my home computer and send wireless to the computer from my verizon device? 
or is there a reason to buy something else? 
thanks
