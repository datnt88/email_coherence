hi everyone! 
so, i pulled a led out of an old case of mine just to realize it is a p led hook up. 
normally, i would experiment a bit. 
however, as this is my only computer at the moment i don't really want to take the chances of messing too much up hardware wise. 
question: could i use a 3 pin connector to hook up a + and - p led? or is there a more simple way? 
any way at all? 
splicing wires? 
(the p led slots on my mobo are already filled) i've tried google but nothing is really pinpointing what i need to know. 
i would love to find a site that explains the current from the psu a bit. 
at the moment i really have no clue what the red/black/and yellow wires of my 3-pins mean specifically but i would love to (i am just now starting to mess with wiring. 
i normally just strayed from that). 
thanks in advance all!
