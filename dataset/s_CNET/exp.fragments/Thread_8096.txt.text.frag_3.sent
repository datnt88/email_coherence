thanks, chris. 
i spoke to some other people who said that it could be a problem with the internal fan - perhaps dust was collecting on the fan and its performance has been compromised. 
the cpu, they theorized, was getting too hot as a result, so the computer shut down like that to keep from overheating. the suggestion i got was to look at the fan and make sure it was clean and if needed, to replace it. 
two questions for you: 1) what do you think of that theory? 
2) why does the computer make that buzzing noise when the screen goes blank? it sounds like a warning buzzer that stops after ten seconds or so? 
what you outlined, if that's what needs to be done, is this something i can do on my own, or should i contact someone to do it for me? 
thanks for your help.
