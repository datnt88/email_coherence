daughters ibm thinkpad with xp pro (fast machine, heavy on ram) took forever to boot, forever to open a web page, slow all around, had to click shut down twice to get it to power off. 
i worked on it for a couple of days then noticed skype. 
uninstalled it and bam! 
boots in less than two minutes and all the other speed problems are gone.
