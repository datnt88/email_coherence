i've set up a home network using my work laptop, called mshome. 
i can see the other machine in microsoft windows network both ways - between pc and laptop. 
when i try to open the machine, i have to log on. 
the pc is called orangeroom and the laptop is laptop28. 
my log on username for both machines is &quot;cool&quot;. 
when i try to log on to the laptop through the network, by typing in &quot;cool&quot; with a password, it changes to orangeroom/cool but won't log on. 
when i try to log onto the pc from the laptop, i again have to log on and i get an error message: the username you typed in is the same as the user name you logged on with. 
that user name has already been tried. 
a domain controller cannot be found to verify that user name. 
i'm running xp pro sp2 and would really appreciate some help!
