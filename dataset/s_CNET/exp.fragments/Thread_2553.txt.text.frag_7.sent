since my computer has already &quot;crashed&quot;, i must assume i will be using the floppy &quot;a&quot; drive since nothing else works at present. 
most solutions seem to require a functioning cd drive. 
fortunately, this is a refurbished unit for &quot;learning&quot; purposes and has nothing to lose, although i did make a data backup for some reason. 
i have an ms dos boot disk, and the 6 floppiy win xp setup disks, if required. 
most of the repair software seems to require a functioning cd drive, which i have not. 
due to my blunder, i am past that stage.i will never again run any program that touches my registry, although &quot;cc cleaner&quot; was reviewed by cnet. 
as it is past midnight here, i will start tomorrow, after checking back at this website for further advice. 
grats!.
