you might try not using the microwave unit or remembering it will drop when its used. 
why it changes confounds many. 
remember that it could be like a recent find where the door didn't seal well. 
i used a little of the common kitchen spray and paper wipes to clean the microwave around the door. 
a seed was there and it didn't close all the way.
