i realize that ati does not yet have (to my knowledge) this exact capability, but does the gtx260/280 provide a substantial cuda performance increase that would justify the higher price? 
this is important for me, because i do a good bit of video transcoding which appears to benefit greatly from these applications that can take advantage of the gpu.
