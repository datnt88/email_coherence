thanks bill, i'm from the old school. 
i do work with computers that run xp and windows 2000 pro. 
i am from the old dos days. 
i was trying to get a clean start in my install of windows 2k. i deleted all the data with sure delete. 
it writes 0's to the hard drives. 
they are no longer recognized by anything as they were before. 
except when i boot up the bios has all the drives listed properly. 
the hd lights come on and stay on a short time like the drive is being read. 
but when i try to do anything to the drives including the cd that came with the wd drives that has the utilites on it, it does nothing. 
i have tried to boot up with a floppy and run fdisk but the software said it could not find the drive. 
everything is new, including the drives. 
i got in a hurry and wanted to check things out with my old me operating system. 
i should have waited and loaded 2k on the clean drives..... the cd boots up, but does not start the install process. 
it says there is no drive. 
i'll go back to square one and check everything. 
and try as you suggest. 
i'll see if the other drive can be accessed and installed to. 
thanks for you help.
