not a word about the pcs in the posts, the operating systems involved, firewalls, etc. this is a volunteer forum so you help others help you. 
some expected us to ask for every detail but i won't. 
if the member can't volunteer all the details then it's best they find local hands on help or call into a support link. 
both linksys and dlink support lines are quite good. 
try them.
