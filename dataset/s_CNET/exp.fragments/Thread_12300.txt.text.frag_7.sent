i have a lian li pc61 aluminum case with a blow hole on top but i'm not finished setting it up permanently. 
i just wanted a guideline (from intel preferably) to determine how well i was doing or, to what extent i needed to go because as it is it's at about 50 c or so and that seemed very high because my p3 was much lower. 
i'd really rather not have it hotter than 90 f i could.
