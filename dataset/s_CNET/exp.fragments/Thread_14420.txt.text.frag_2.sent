secureid token. 
it generates a random and changing code. 
when i login i must enter the current code that's displayed. 
occasionally it will fail and i will be asked to wait and enter the next code. 
i don't know what happens at the other end. 
i presume what i type must match what's expected. 
it's an it secret and they're not telling. 
my device isn't to access the wireless network specifically but the vpn. the device will fit on a key chain, is about two inches long and resembles a usb flash drive. is this what you mean?
