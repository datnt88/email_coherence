1. if you are referring to whether or not i took the cover off to let more air in, well not exactly. 
i did take my cover off becuase i was looking for a noising fan (what i thought was the problem), and even with the cover off and a new fan, the computer was still shuting down. 
2. i do not have a spare video card 3. while i know how to plug my parts in, i guess i don't know what it means to balance the rails or how to balance the rails. 
can you provide more information?
