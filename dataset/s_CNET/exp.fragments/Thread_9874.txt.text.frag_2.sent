i can't find the exact model but i'm finding many folk reporting &quot;it's going to sleep&quot; because the monitor shows such a message. 
what's really happening is the laptop shut down and the monitor shows a &quot;going to sleep&quot; message so let's move on. 
given the gma i have to guess the age but let's check if you are using the canned air to clean every few months.
