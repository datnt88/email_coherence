there is nothing wrong with any of the companies mentioned but have you looked locally??? i am a little biased here because i own and operate a small pc shop. 
i can offer everything the big guys do as far as pricing and quality, plus one thing they can't. 
i'm right down the street in case you have any questions. 
pre-sale, during or post-sale you have the ability to contact me. 
will dell or any of the others pre-load your favorite game and install any save points or characters from your old system??? have it up and running when you pick it up??? how about oem components with their short warranties??? give us a chance before buying on brand alone!!
