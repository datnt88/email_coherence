hi; i just bought skyrim for the pc. i fit all of the essential requirements, and the game will play. 
but for the recommended i need a better video card. 
i have an ati radeon hd 4350. 
apparently that's not enough. 
the game is a pretty laggy (enough for it to be annoying.) here is the requirements it says i need. 
any recommendations on what i should get? 
i have been thinking about upgrading for a while, so i am willing to spend a fair amount. 
nothing outrageous, though. 
i don't do that much gaming. 
here is my pc specs.
