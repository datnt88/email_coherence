sorry it took a few days to respond. 
first, reset the bios by removing power from the board and pulling the battery out and letting the board sit for 24hrs. 
then re-installed the latest version driver for the chipset and ran the tests again, and the same errors occured. 
we tried several different chipset driver versions and ran the test again after each. 
each time we got the same problems. 
reguarding the amd away driver, it is installed and we tried several versions of the driver, though windows still believes there to be a secondary ide channel. 
msi support has sent me the following response, and am doubtful that they will even do anything about it. 
&quot;thanks for your feedback and useful information.&quot; 
i hate to think that the new graphics card was a complete waste of money, but msi doesn't seem to be standing behind their products.
