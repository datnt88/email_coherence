i have been refilling my ink cartridges for years and haven't had any problems. 
i have a canon photo i960 with six colored cartridges and i do a lot of photo printing. 
the only thing i found out is a cartridge will last about a year and then the photo's do not reproduce properly. 
when that happens, i buy another set of cartridges and start refilling them. 
i estimate it cost me about 10 cents to refill a cartridge.
