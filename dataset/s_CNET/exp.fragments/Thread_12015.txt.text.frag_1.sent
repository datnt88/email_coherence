yesterday night, my house rcd tripped while i'm uploading file to internet. 
after recovered pc power, i found that my sata hdd disappeared from windows xp hdd list - other 2 ide hdd, fdd, dvd drives & movable drive remained. 
i opened device manager, selected drives icon and right clicked on it then forced it to scan for hardware change. 
device manager didn't found the sata drive. 
however, every time i rebooted the pc, bios reported existence of the sata hdd. 
i tried connect that sata hdd to sata0 then 1 of my gigabyte ga-8s655fx(-l) motherboard (my motherboard had 2 available sata ports). 
each time bios could found the hdd drive. 
was my sata dead ? 
if no, how could i make xp to discover it again ?
