sorry. did i mention that i am a novice? 
how do i 'properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another ide port until finished'? 
can you please give me a quick run down or link me to an appropriate site. 
either way, thank you very much for your help steven. 
i assume i go into 'bios' and slave it there. 
can i slave it before i connect it?
