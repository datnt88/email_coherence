i have the same problem, formatted my hp laptop that had windows media center edition and installed xp professional, now it only recognizes 256mb out of my total 2gb installed. 
i actually created a thread about this in another forum, and people are trying to help me out, go to the link below gtwilson, if i fix the problem i'll post it in the other forum and not this one.
