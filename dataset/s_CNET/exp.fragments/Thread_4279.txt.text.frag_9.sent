if you look in your manual they explain how to use the flash back feature. 
they tell you what to rename the file to. 
it looks like. 
download the bios file.....zipped. 
unzip the file. 
rename the file. 
copy the file to a usb stick.....note the restrictions about fat and partitions. 
insert the usb stick in the proper port. 
push the button.
