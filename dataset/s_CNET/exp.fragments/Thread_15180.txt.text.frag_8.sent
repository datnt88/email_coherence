if you're planning to stick with your current processor you don't need a new psu. the x800xl uses very low energy (like 60watts). 
go check out the x800xl online. 
my friend has a 250watt(or 270watt cheap psu) psu; he got an x800 overclocked with a 3500+ and 768ram, no cooling except cpu/heatsink, 1 double layer cd/dvd combo and last but not least, a 120gb hd. no problems at all. 
his computer doesn't get very hot, sometimes very warm. 
google the x800xl yourself and find out.
