i purchased a 4gb pny flash drive about three months ago. 
up until last week, it functioned ok even though it would constantly open when i carried it in my pocket. 
last week, it got bent while in our laptop computer's usb port. the plug will still snap closed, but i sometimes have to pry it out of the enclosure. 
and for about four days now, when i plug it in the usb port of our laptop (windows 7), i hear the sound that indicates the computer recognizes the device, but the device doesn't appear in the list of removable media. 
when i plug it into the desktop pc (winxp), i see the removable drive in the list of drives, but when i click on it, i get the message &quot;please insert a disk into drive [letter]:&quot; any way to recover what's on this disk?
