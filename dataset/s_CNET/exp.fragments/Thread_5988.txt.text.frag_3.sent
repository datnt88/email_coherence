hi donnie agreeing with jbking but would like to add this. 
you should plan and prepare carefully while choosing the components. 
you must get a sli ( in case of nvidia) or a crossfire ( in case of ati) certified motherboard and graphic card(s). 
also a bigger psu because two cards will need more power. 
if you do not go for a sli or crossfire certified motherboard , you won't be able to add a second graphic card , unless you change the motherboard . 
same goes for the graphic card ; it won't be useful in dual graphic card config if it is not sli or crossfire certified.
