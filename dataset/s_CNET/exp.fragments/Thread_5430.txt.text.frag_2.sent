if so, there isn't going to be adequate power to run an external 3 1/2 inch drive. 
taking current measurements with a multimeter is a tricky and imprecise process as well. 
you can't really measure what can be provided but only what is being drawn at any one time. 
as well, motors need much more current to start them than to keep them spinning. 
the rule i remember from long ago is 7x current to start. 
this won't apply universally today but might give you an idea of what to expect. 
you should be able to plug just the power connector from the 4 pin molex on a computer's ps and get it to spin without a data cable connected. 
if it does, the drive's mechanical system is ok. if not, the drive is probably beyond its usefulness.
