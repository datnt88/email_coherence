crt's are measured from one top corner to the opposing bottom corner of the picture tube in a diagonal fashion. 
you often hear the term &quot;viewable size&quot; and this refers to the amount of the tube not covered by the shroud or bezzel. 
lcd screens are what you see is what you get though i think they are still measured from top corner to opposing bottom corner. 
at any rate a 17&quot; lcd will usually have a larger screen than a crt simply because none of the lcd screen will be covered by a shroud or bezzel. 
one interesting thing i've noticed is that even though an lcd has a bigger screen it looks like it is smaller simply because of the smaller footprint of the monitor. 
it sort of fools the brain because of the small package that contains the big screen. 
we're all used to seeing 20&quot; deep and wide monitors and now they are only a few inches deep.
