the pen is definitely intriguing. 
although the cost is about the same as an ipad. 
it looks like photoshop express is the only thing compatible with windows 8 pro - which as far as i can tell is only for photo editing. 
are there other apps or software tools that go beyond just photos? 
(text on a designed background) numbers on the ipad is a positive - didn't realize that was an option. 
i assume the cloud is the easiest way to ensure changes are captured between devices? 
and does that mean that excel is available on windows 8 pro tablet? 
but what does that mean for document sharing with my mac?
