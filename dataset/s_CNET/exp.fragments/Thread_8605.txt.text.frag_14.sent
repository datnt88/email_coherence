i cant afford any router right now so checking that is out of the question, the reason i had purchased a new router was because my d-link dir-615 had just died on me. 
thats the only other router i have used besides the di-(forgot numbers) which was really old and needed to be replaced because it didnt support wireless n. unfortunately at this time i dont have any way to check interferences, but i highly doubt that its that because i've changed nearly all the channels.
