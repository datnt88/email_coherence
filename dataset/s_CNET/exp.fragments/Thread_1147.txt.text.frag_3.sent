since windows isn't that reliable i think you mean the pc. at the office we have about half a dozen netbooks and all have been reliable. 
the last one was from walmart and they work too. 
about the ecards on the machine. 
not one laptop/netboook comes with ecards so you would install some email app. 
let's hope you are not thinking about incrediamail since that's not reliable.
