testing them seperately, they both worked fine. 
so, i returned to the original configuration (dvd as master, cd-rw as slave on channel 2), and they even worked while they were together again. 
so far, the problem seems to be solved by opening the case, removing the ide cable, and reconnecting it. 
could it be a problem with one of the pins on the dvd drive? 
i don't really want to have to open my case every week just so my drives will work. 
any suggestions for a next step? 
thank you.
