if your pc has high-definition (hd) audio, then its built-in audio is as good as an inexpensive ($15) sound card. 
here's a simple test. 
buy your speakers, plug them into your portable cd or mp3 player, and listen to a few songs. 
now plug them into your pc, and listen to the same songs. 
if the pc sounds 'hissy' or 'buzzy' compared to your cd/mp3 player, get a new sound card. 
if you can't tell (or don't mind) the difference, stick with your on-board sound. 
if you do choose to get a sound card, the creative audigy 4 is $80 retail and the diamond xtreme with dolby digital live is about $60 retail. 
some walmarts have the sound blaster live external for about $50. to me, the best cheap upgrade for on-board sound is the good ol' sound blaster live! 
you can get it at geeks.com for about $30. most sound cards include a bunch of crap/unneeded software. 
when installing, just select the bare minimum necessary to avoid many of the driver/software headaches that often follow sound cards.
