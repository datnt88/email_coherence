i just noticed all the back and forth on this topic. 
i noticed bob that rjla has a good point. 
you do not know anything about this product but you are quick to judge. 
i too was a skeptic but as rjla noted its about more than just the anonymous portion, its about keeping the line clean. 
also, what do you recommend regarding the anonymous portion. 
you talk about the gov. 
and laws so that i can only assume you have a law degree or are just another conspiracy theorist. 
the man is watching. 
what are you using now to be anonymous, nothing. 
i assume using something to be anonymous is better than nothing even if, as you claim, the gov. 
can eventually gain access to it. 
using your logic, if the gov can gain access to encrypted packets then using nothing is the worst thing you can do because the gov. 
does'nt even have to lift a finger to monitor you. 
let me know how you solve this problem. 
also, why all this gov. 
fear. the anonymous portion also prevents from non-gov from looking in like your isp,riaa,etc. 
are these not something to worry about. 
i worry about these before the government or better yet, forget the gov. 
as we all know who they work for... the truth is out there
