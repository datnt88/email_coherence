i always wondered about that, so, when ink could no longer be found for my epson c-62 i went to a place that offered to fill any cartridge for $4. my printer was &quot;special&quot; so the refill did not cost substantially less. the machine stopped printing red after the first cartridge and could not be cleaned. 
i bought a new hp printer and i'm sticking to hp ink which i can get at a discount store for the same price the $4 guy sells it for.
