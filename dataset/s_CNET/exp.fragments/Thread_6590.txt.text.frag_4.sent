i am doing exactly what you are trying to do. 
transfer old lps to my hard-drive and to cds (i assume). 
i guess ignorance is bliss, because i installed realplayer (after many annoying pop-ups, etc.) and found that for $19.95 i could have (among other things) the option of recording from &quot;line-in&quot; or &quot;mic&quot; jacks on my sound card. 
all i did then was run a cable from the &quot;phones&quot; jack on my old turntable to the &quot;line-in&quot; jack on my sound card. 
after opening realplayer, i chose &quot;record from line-in or mic&quot; and followed the step-by-step procedure which was kind of intuitive. 
with a few trial & error guesses, you will be off and running! 
i have not found this option with windows media player, and queries to ms produced no satisfactory replys except for computer generated &quot;faq&quot; answers. 
if they can't be bothered, neither can i.
