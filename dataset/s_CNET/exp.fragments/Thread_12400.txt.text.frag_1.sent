hello i have a gtx 260 video card and from 1 month i have a strange problem. 
once i start the computer there is no video signal coming from the video card or at least the signal that is coming from it it is not showing anything. 
so i have to leave the computer turned on for around 15 minutes (before was less) and than at some point the video signal is start working and i can see the windows log-in box, and then there aren't any problems. 
even if i turn off the computer and start it again it starts normal. 
only if i turn it off and leave it for longer time turned off , than once i turn it back on i have to wait again. 
any idea what might be the problem ? 
do i need to change the video card or it is something else ?
