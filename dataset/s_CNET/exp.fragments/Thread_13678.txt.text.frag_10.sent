and i'm leaning toward usb2 & sata on the controller and ext hd. also, in case i want to use it with another device (don't have any right now though) that supports it, should i get a card that supports those plus firewire? 
and, should i specifically get an external hard drive, or should i get an internal + usb2 / esata enclosure? 
and, any recommendations on what specific model to get? 
i looked at newegg, and they have a cavalry caxm37500 for $122.99 (- rebate + shipping & tax) and a western digital my book premium es wdg1su5000n for $154.99. 
(they also have a seagate freeagent pro for $171.99, but that's more than i can afford. 
i do need to buy the adapter card too.) then... which add-on card to get? 
encore enladp-402 - $19.99 - 4 ext usb 2.0, 2 int sata koutech usb2.0 & firewire & sata combo pci card model io-pc820 - $49.99 (more than i want to pay) - 2 ext firewire, 1 ext sata, 2 ext usb ports or is there another one i should look at? i'd like to spend no more than $25-35 and get at least 4 - 6 external ports, distributed between usb 2.0 & sata, with at least 2 of each type. 
i am leaning away from firewire for now, cause i don't think i need it just yet. 
i may have 2 available slots... should i get separate cards for usb & sata?: the $20 encore card mentioned above, plus... bytecc bt- pci-sata150 - $21.99 - 2 ext sata ports (total combined price would still be less than the $50 card, and i'd have 2 each of internal and external sata ports.)
