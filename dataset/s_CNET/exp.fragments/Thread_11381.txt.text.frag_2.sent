sorry but the benchmarks are done and i won't duplicate that here. 
it's simply a matter of did they sell you on the features. 
they didn't for me and i have a rather nice history of many laptops over the years (more than 10) and zero hard disk failures. 
in fact all machines went on to other family members who killed them for me. 
mostly they run over them with cars or dropping down a stairwell. 
funny thing is that the hard disk survived and we got the files out. 
now why would i not use a hard disk?
