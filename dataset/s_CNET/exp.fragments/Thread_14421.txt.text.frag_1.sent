my daughter's computer has been acting up lately. 
it's old and slow anyway, so i decided to move my previously planned upgrade ahead by a few months in order to give her the dell 8200 i'm currently running. 
each system has 2 hard drives. 
the secondary drive on each holds all the data. 
the primary drives hold only programs. 
what i plan to do is swap abby's secondary drive into the 8200. 
i'll remove my secondary drive and put that into the new xps when it arrives. 
this should be just a screwdriver job, correct? 
winxp should recognize the drives all by itself? 
there is one complicating factor: the new xps ships with a serial ata hdd. the secondary drive i want to put into it is an eide. 
i already bought a controller card for the old drive. is there anything i should look out for? the whole point of this exercise is to save myself the trouble of copying all this data over our lan. by the same token, it would be a bad thing if i lost the contents of either of these drives. 
thanks in advance for any helpful advice.
