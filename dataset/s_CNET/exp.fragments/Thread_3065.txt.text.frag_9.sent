1. i'm a linux person so i'd recommend replacing a high-resource hog like windows altogether. 
linux will run on the smell of an oily rag and will usually outperform windows on the same machine. 
2. your machine has computer asthma. 
for either staying with windows or trying linux, go and buy a 256meg stick of memory. 
if that helps and you and you think it's worth it, buy another stick and put that in as well. 
ps, at the risk of starting a &quot;try this&quot; thread, i'd recommend using ubuntu as the linux system. 
if you're not sure about linux, you can run it as a 'live cd' which means you can keep your windows system but boot off the cd and see what linux looks like. 
ubuntu isn't the only linux live cd option out there but it is one of the easiest for a windows user to quickly assess. 
i have a network of nine computers at home, 5 of them use windows, the others use linux. 
one of my greatest pleasures is getting old clunkers to run like new again by running them on linux.
