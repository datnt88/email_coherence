you are dealing with the physics of radio signals. 
an rf signal at some frequency only is received by a proper sized antenna that has the matching resonant frequency. 
there are electronics courses on the subject, but in a nutshell, some want no antennas at all. 
there is a way to move the bigger antenna to another device, then rebroadcast on another freqency that doesn't require a big antenna. 
i supplied just such an solution with that fm transmitter. 
in closing, i can't teach physics or electronic design in this small space. 
you might have to take some courses.
