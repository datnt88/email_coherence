yes! the hyper 212+, that's the one. 
and i already ordered the rosewill challenger case on newegg. 
got great reviews, comes with 3 fans (not sure whether the stock will be good enough but it's a good start until i finish my build and decide to buy more or at least better ones to replace the stock.) and i'll be sure to do the bench test.
