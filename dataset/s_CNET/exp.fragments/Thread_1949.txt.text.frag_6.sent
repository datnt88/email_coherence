it's very odd and contradictary to what i've read and experienced. 
very strange. 
about messages during boot and shutdown. 
this is an area that has bothered new to pc people for over a decade. 
let me share that such displays were never standardised and you will indeed see such informational messages during the transitions. 
the apple macintosh is better at this and some will take comfort there.
