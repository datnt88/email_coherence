and what if i went with an amd phenom x4? i found a nice looking one at 3.5ghz on newegg for $190ish. 
i know intel tends to be more on the cutting edge, but i'm trying to stay under $1000, and i need to focus on the gpu more than the cpu, because the rig i want to build will be for games primarily.
