i have a computer i am trying to fix, and have run across something ive never seen before. 
according to the customer, she was trying to check to see if a disk was bootable, so for some reason she went into the bios and disabled the hard drive in the boot menu. 
now, i can get it to start with a bootable cd in it, but not without, as it is not reading the drive. 
and it will not let me into the bios no matter what i do. is there a quick fix for this?
