i am truly perplexed, but upon reconnecting the power cables, etc., i had everything spinning up as it should....so i proceeded to hook everything back up and it is working like a charm. 
what's so odd is that when i first began, prior to doing the short test, the switch (which i never reseated at all) would not invoke the slightest bit of life. 
i verified that the two box fans, the two cpu fans, and the graphic card fan all spun up, the scsi devices are all correctly recognized, etc...behavior normal. 
i am totally perplexed but very, very happy! 
i still have no clue what happened but this appears to be a happy ending to the story. 
thanks!
