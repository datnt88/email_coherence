$350 is too much for this pc. everyone else is right, you can get a new, faster pc for just around $100 more, that will out perform this one on craigslist. 
there are lots and lots of people on craigslist who fancy themselves as pc salesmen. 
they will paint a big picture of this great machine they have for only $xxx. it is better to not put out this kind of money for any used pc, unless they can demonstrate to you in person that it will indeed live up to the hype they are talking.
