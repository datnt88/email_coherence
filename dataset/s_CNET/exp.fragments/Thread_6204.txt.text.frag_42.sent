compare the 25 gb free online storage available through skydrive with the overly highly praised 2 gb free online storage available through dropbox. 
you can't do much with 2 gb and prices go up fast from there. 
i frequently post 50 to 75 high resolution photos to skydrive for family members. 
you simply cannot do that with dropbox free version.
