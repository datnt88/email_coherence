what kind of hardware would best allow me to share my pc monitor (sony sdm-hs73) with my xbox? 
i've heard tv tuner cards or special adapters (e.g. startech comp2vga game-console-to-pc-monitor adapter) but would like specific feedback if possible. 
i would prefer a solution that allows me to switch between both uses as easily as possible (i.e. don't want to have to plug/unplug stuff all the time). the main reason i ask is that i want to use xbox live but my phone jacks are limited (2 in whole house, neither near our only tv where xbox currently located). 
i would love to simply put my xbox on my desk which is huge and share the dsl and hopefully the monitor too.
