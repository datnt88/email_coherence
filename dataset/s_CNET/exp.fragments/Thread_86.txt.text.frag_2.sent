i believe this drive has a usb 2.0 interface and no power supply. 
unfortunately, your ibook only has usb 1.0 and not enough power up the usb chain to power the drive which could result in a non-mounting drive. 
if there is a connection on the drive enclosure for an external power supply, that would cover that problem and the drive would mount with no problem. 
i say, no problem. 
you would still be left with the slow usb 1 transfer speeds. 
what is that, 12mbs?
