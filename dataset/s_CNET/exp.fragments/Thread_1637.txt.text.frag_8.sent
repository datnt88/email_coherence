nero comes with a drive info tool that will rate the speed of the drive. 
check out whether or not for some reason the drives speed has been reduced from it's rated speed. 
other than that you can check out a few websites (cdfreaks comes to mind) where you can check out the rated write speeds of various discs. 
some are rated for a much higher speed than they will ever attain.
