&quot;motherboard intel cpu p4 1700ghz ram 256+256 external hard drive is connected throw usb port when i unplug the external hd it restarts normally&quot; while interesting, it didn't tell exactly where the usb port is, or the make/model of the motherboard and if the bios was up to date. 
you may want to either become more familiar with what you have or just make this a warranty issue with the machine's supplier.
