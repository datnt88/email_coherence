and we spent that much on the transformer and dock. the office picked up a windows 8 laptop asus k55n for 380 so i can't tell what the tablet attraction is here. 
ok, at home we have a kindle fire hd 7 as well and it does great at playing hd on the big screen and the sound is really good. 
my comment about youtube is that it's not the same as the pc. google has moved to monetize the tablet experience and you might not see some content on the phone or tablets. 
some folk get really upset over that. 
sorry but as the nexus 7 is about the same, i thought it was close enough.
