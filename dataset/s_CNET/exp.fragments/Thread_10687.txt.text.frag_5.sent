thanks for your help. 
and as for the old computer, i've already transferred my data. 
i am giving it to a friend and plan to reformat the hard drive first. 
i know that won't make my data completely uncovereable, but i don't know of any free programs for that, so reformating is the best i can do. 
thanks again!
