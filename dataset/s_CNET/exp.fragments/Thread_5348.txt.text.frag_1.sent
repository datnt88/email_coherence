greetings. 
i was hoping somebody might be able to help me out of a bind. 
a few days ago my computer stopped connecting to the internet. 
i'm on an ethernet network. 
i ran ipconfig at the command prompt to release and renew my ip, which didn't work. 
i checked the cables and connections, as well, which were all fine. the computer sees no problem with the card or the connection, and no other computer is having difficulties. 
i also ran adaware, winsock, and my antivirus to cover my bases. the one thing that caught my eye is on the ipconfig it says &quot;media disconnected.&quot; 
i'm not extremely network savvy, but the windows help (yes, i was that desperate) noted it was something i should ensure it didn't say (not that it said what to do about it). 
for the record, i'm using windows xp, a netgear en104tb ethernet hub, and a realtek rtl8169/8110 family gigab ethernet nic, although i suspect it's software related somehow. 
any help would be appreciated, and thank you in advance.
