hey thanks for the info, but unfortunately it still didn't help, i used my ps/2 keyboard and mouse, and cleared the bios and still no luck, the seven beeps mean no keyboard and can't initiate the post test...i tryed the ps/2 adapter for the wireless keyboard and it worked for a little bit right up the tower was shaken, and soon as the keyboard wireless reciever cut off the screen went blank no response....would it be easier to just change the motherboard as i still have the warrenty on it? 
thanks for the help....this is a learning experience for me as i'm doin a+ i can use this as an example for the future, that is why i would like to solve the problem...
