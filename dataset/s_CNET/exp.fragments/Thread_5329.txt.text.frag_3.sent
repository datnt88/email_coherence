read post no 5 &quot;even with a core 2 duo overclocked to 2.67, two dvd burners, 3 hdds, and an ati x850, i peak less than 190 watts. 
i've had much higher power requirements when i ran a p4 clocked to 3.5 ghz in the same computer and that went up to 280 watts at times yet the quality 330 watt active pfc power supply didn't even stutter.&quot;
