and offer nearly identical performance. 
since you want a lot of memory, get one with 6 ddr3 slots. the other distinguishing factor for an x58 board is the number of pci-express x16 slots. 
2 is sufficient for most everyone. 
i suggest either of these mobos. 
both top out at 24gb (6x4gb). 
msi x58 platinum: gigabyte ga-ex58-ud4p: after you decide on a mobo, select your memory from the mobo manufacturer's qualified (tested) vendor list. the x58 and ddr3 memory is still a bit finicky.
