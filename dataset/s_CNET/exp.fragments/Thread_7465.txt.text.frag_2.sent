the clue that you revealed with your 448mb memory shows your machine has shared memory video. 
such will not get any noticable speed boost with an additional 1g of ram since the video can slow or pause the cpus access to ram. in this case a dedicated video card would help if you can actually disable the onboard video. 
laptops and most i810 based boards can't do that.
