i took the time to compare your router's manual with my router (nearly the same model) and used the exact words you would see on the router's setup screen. 
i did this to make it as easy as possible and noted the one change i would do to make it work. 
all this networking stuff does seem complex but if you need to go beyond the one change i'd try then it's back to the books or get a real wap. 
hope you see i tried to make it as easy as i could.
