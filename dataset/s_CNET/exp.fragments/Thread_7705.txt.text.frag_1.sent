i am thinking about picking one up but wanted to hear some thoughts about the model and the 'n' spec (or lack thereof) in general. 
i am currently running a netgear gs gigabit switch with a pos linksys single port router. 
this would be my first wireless experience (and would provide extra gigabit ports). 
i have a work laptop with g and any laptop in my future would definitly have n.
