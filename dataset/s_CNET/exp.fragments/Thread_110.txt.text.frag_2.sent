let's just say it's not windows xp in a 4 ounce package. 
can you reduce the magnitude of your question? 
for instance some wanted to run the full microsoft office on a pda. the answer is no. where to get information? 
why not the maker of that windows mobile os or device? 
if they don't answer they are saying &quot;go away.&quot;
