i am looking to buy a multifunction photo printer.i have heard that epson are leaders in printers but now cannon has new technology. 
i think i have narrowed down the search between the cannon mp950 and the epson rx700. 
i had photos printed on the rx700 but not on the mp950. the cannon has a dpi of 9600 x 2400 and the epson has 5760 by 1440. 
what does that really mean? 
i printed pictures on the cannon ip6600d(on epson photo paper) which is also has a dpi of 9600 x 2400 and the epson pictures looked clearer and had brighter clors.will the cannon look better on the cannon paper? 
i am so confused.
