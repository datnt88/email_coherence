to a point it will. 
it has a number of reports that will work against the open collection buffer. 
simple i/o rate graph seem ok. 
you can build filters for each address pair and graph i think up to 5 at the same time. 
if you work at you could graph different protocols as well as ip addresses. 
the issue with using wireshark as a live protocol analyzer is that it really a packet capture tool designed to look at data after it is captured. 
the only live data it can look at is in the capture buffer. 
although the size of this buffer can be made large when you capture on path that has a lot of traffic the buffer will wrap over itself and if you make the buffer too large you will bog the machine down. the method i use is to let it capture for a few minutes to a file and then stop and look at the file. 
although not real time the more advanced reports are more accurate. 
the reports that show jitter in voip calls only seem to work on non live data. 
on paths that are running huge amounts of data i use 2 machines. 
one to capture the data since it can do little else and another to look at the data. 
you can set wireshark to write the data to files at a set interval of set byte count. 
i share the drive it writes to and open the files using another copy of wireshark. 
not truly live data but only a couple minutes old.
