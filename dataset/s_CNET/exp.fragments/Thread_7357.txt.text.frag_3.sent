color laser printers is no longer for luxurious office item. 
they can print faster and cheaper than ink jet printer and, most of all, they don't cause smearing problems even in 20 lbs cheap papers. 
for me, i have two old color laser printers (phaser 740, hp4500 n)which i got from local craigslist flee market ( ) and their color graphic qualities are better than that of dell photosmart inkjet printer or epson 740i inkjet. 
considering long lifespan of printer toner, consummables of color laser printers may be cheaper than those of inkjet printers. 
i recommend to check internet review first, then search for items either at ebay (nearby address) or at your local craigslist, contact nearby sellers, check the printer, and buy it. 
you won't regret!
