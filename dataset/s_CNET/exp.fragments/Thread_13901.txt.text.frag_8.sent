services performed by others. 
you see the same prices on services performed at an automotive repair shop. 
example: a pair of brake pads at pep boys is 9.99 (see ) to have them installed is no less than 20 times that in most cases. 
back to your hard drive. 
this is a cheap part. 
under 100 bucks at many stores (see newegg.com for example.) but if we don't do this ourselves then the automotive example works well here. 
if we don't do it ourselves then we get to pay for it.
