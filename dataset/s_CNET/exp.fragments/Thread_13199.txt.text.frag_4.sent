the technician said in order to replace the nic the motherboard has to be replaced! 
they told me to back up anything i don't want to lose and they said i will most likely have to reinstall the operating system. 
how do i do all of this? they are coming tuesday and i can't figure out how to backup anything! 
as for reinstalling the operating system, are they talking about the recovery disks you make when you first run your new computer? 
that is all i have, recovery disks.
