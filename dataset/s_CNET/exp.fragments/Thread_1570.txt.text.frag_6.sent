i would do with the intel. 
while rprofitt is right and lines concerning ghz have been blurred in recent years you mention that you will be doing some light video editing. 
from reviews i have read, not taking the video card into account, the intel quad is faster for video editing. 
good idea to go with lots of memory as well. 
good luck
