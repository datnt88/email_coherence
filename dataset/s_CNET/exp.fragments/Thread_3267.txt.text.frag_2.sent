he's much better off picking the right sound card, and i mean a pro-level sound card like roland stuff, not the creative labs stuff. the cpu and mainbord wouldn't matter much for music editing. 
but then, the term &quot;editing music&quot; can vary slightly. 
does he mean he want to do midi, or is he more into sound editing, like mod tracking, wav editing and so on?
