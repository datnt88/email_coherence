sorry to butt in at this late date. 
anyway, here goes. 
have same final problem, can't get past &quot;unlock scanner&quot;. 
for what it's worth, this scanner worked fine for over 2 years on this computer with me. 
(gateway laptop) i had to reformat hard drive still using me, and now it sounds like your problem. 
i tried origional installation disk and then latest drivers. 
i really want to say that i had this problem once before, but then would have to admit to old age memory loss as i can't remember what resolved it. 
have you had any luck yet?
