i would either contact or call the company if if you can't reach them on the internet and find out before purchasing the extra hard drive. 
the name is one that i don't recognize as being an apple compatible but i don;t know for sure. 
i have a lacie 200 gb connected by firewire external hard drive which i use to store all my completed or workiing folders. 
my main computer has all the programs i am using on its hard drive. 
i am beginning to store things on cd's for safe keeping, like digital photos, other photoshop items i have completd. 
the price of external hard drives is coming down and i have had mine three years and it is over half full right now with absolutely no problems. 
go with products of a good well known company with a solid reputation and you won't go wrong. 
pick up something just because of price and you may be asking for trouble. 
deal with a reputable company/dealer also. 
it does make a difference.
