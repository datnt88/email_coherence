i had a dell latitude d600 with a 1.4ghz pentium m in it once, and that thing was amazingly fast. 
it ran windows xp like my macbook pro runs mac os x. boot time was something like 35 seconds, and programs responded instantly. 
it was great. 
i'd also have to agree with the others who've said that the atom processor is not really meant for much heavy lifting. 
i've used other people's atom netbooks, and none of them run even windows xp very well, much less windows 7, even though they usually have more memory than my old latitude (netbooks generally have 1gb, whereas the latitude had 512mbs). 
plus, these old computers were the top of the line in their day, so they were meant to last a looooong time. 
netbooks are the cheapest of the cheap and not very well constructed.
