i am currently about to build my first machine. 
i know a bit about pc's, however, being that i am a bonafied noobie i would some suggestions or slaps across the face with my decision. 
my motherboard is an intel dg965wh series and my chip is an intel core duo 6300. 
my goal is to get this machine to run smoothly, as i am an avid mmo player and my machine at home is about to become my wifes. 
i guess my question comes down to, how do i pick out the right power supply so as to power my machine and get it to accept the specs i want, and are there any restrictions about the case i pick. 
my goal is to hook up a 320 gb hard drive ( most likely 7200 rpm maxtor ) 2 gb of ram ( pc4200 )and a pci-e nvidia graphics card ( 256mb or above ). 
any help or general slaps in the face would be appreciated.
