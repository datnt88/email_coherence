download can be done on other machines if that is an issue. 
installing appears to be the problem and the mention of driver update apps sends shivers down my spine as those are known to create more trouble than they cure. 
i can't tell what you did to try to fix this. 
turning off the firewall and av is common but a lot of malware blocks such updates. 
keep writing. 
bob ps. there is another thought about this. 
does sp3 have something you need?
