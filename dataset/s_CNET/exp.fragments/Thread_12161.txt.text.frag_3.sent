thank you phil, 01. the camera is web enabled as this can be set in the camera menu. 
02. i have obtained the correct firewire cable. 
03. 2 of the three pc's i have do have firewire connections. 
i'm surprised that the hp compaq (the latest purchase) does not have firewire. 
i would have though all new pc's would have this as a standard. 
i will give this a try now and see how things work out. 
i have been told that using a digital video camera as a webcam provides far superior image compared to the usual webcams on the market.
