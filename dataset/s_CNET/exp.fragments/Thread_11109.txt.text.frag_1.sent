hi guys, pc -hp dv7 4020sa os- windows 7 basically two years ago i purchased this laptop and a few days ago the computer just shut off. 
when i tried turning it on i got a black screen after the windows boot logo. 
i tried connecting a external monitor via the vga port but same thing. 
i checked all the forums and found out the display drivers were the problem, i went into safe mode(worked:d) and uninstalled them and the laptop seemed to boot up fine but the display was all grainy and big. 
so i thought the best way to solve this would be to do a complete factory reset. 
now after the reset im getting the same problem but this time i cant even boot into safe mode because it says i have to do a &quot;setup new computer&quot; process in normal mode. 
please any help will be appriciated. 
thanks again
