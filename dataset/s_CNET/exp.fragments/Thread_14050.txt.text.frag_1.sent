help, i am desperate!! i am looking for specific instructions on how to remedy the problem of random packet loss. 
i've had comcast dig up my yard, spent countless hours w/tech supp. 
for linksys & dell with no results. 
finally someone mentioned 'packet loss and random disconnect' - this is me!! i have 2 new dell laptops & 1 new dell desktop all with vista 64 bit. 
my router is linksys wrt160n. 
please tell me **how** to fix this problem. 
i need specific detailed instructions. 
i am not a pc newbie, yet not an expert either. 
i have reviewed the other threads only to see coloquial commentary responses. 
feel free to e-mail me directly @ razzzberryl@yahoo.com regards, zippygirl
