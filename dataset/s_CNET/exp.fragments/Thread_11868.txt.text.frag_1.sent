i recently installed network magic on my pc and on another in a home network. 
since the install, about 6 gbs of space has mysteriously disappeared from my hard drive. 
i have installed no other programs. 
i've already looked at the obvious culprits, such as fragmented files, clearing out the various caches, defragging, etc., and i'm stumped. 
network magic is a very small program (less than 50 mbs), so i'm not sure whether its installation and the disk space disappearance are purely coincidental, or whether there's truly a correlation. 
does anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?
