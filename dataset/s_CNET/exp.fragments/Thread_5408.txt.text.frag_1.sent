did a mobo upgrade a while back. with everything else, i got usb 2.0(also added firewire a card). 
when paying extra for usb 2.0 cables, i noticed they don't appear to be any different than my usb 1.1 cables. 
asked a knowledgeable salesperson, he said usb 2.0 cables are marked. 
i can find no difference! 
either this is just a marketing ploy or i have been using, then giving away usb 2.0 cables. 
does anyone have any info about this?
