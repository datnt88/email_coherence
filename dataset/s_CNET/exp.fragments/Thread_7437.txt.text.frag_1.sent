i recently built a new machine. 
the processors i chose was an amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core, 5200+. 
up until yesterday, everything was fine. 
i was running at optimal processor speed and when i checked properties of my computer, it reported as much. 
today, i logged in and checked properties of my computer for a totally seperate reason and saw that the cpu was being reported as running at 996mhz instead of the usualy 2.6ghz. 
my mobo came with a utility that i can run to dynamically bump the speed of my cpu up, but i am reluctant to try it, as i have no experience overclocking. 
what could cause this change? 
should i be concerned about it? 
should i make the change in the utility i have, or is there another utility i can use? 
please help, eric
