i favor best buy extended service plans. 
they are the cheapest in the business and there is no hassle when bringing something in for repair or exchange. 
i bought a laptop from circuit city and the service plan was twice what i could have had it for at best buy. the hard drive went bad and i had to send the whole computer to their service center. the turn around was one week. 
circuit city does not have &quot;in house&quot; service like best buy does. 
their sales people are not as geeky as best buys' either. 
i've had a camera ($500) and a printer ($400) replaced over the counter at best buy in less than 10 min. 
each time. 
when i had a problem with a canon photo printer that i had purchased at circiut city the tech guy at the service center had me on the phone for over 1 1/2 hours trying different procedures before finally agreeing with me that it was &quot;busted&quot;. 
we don't need the hassle. 
besides that, best buys' rebate program is a lot faster than anybody else also.
