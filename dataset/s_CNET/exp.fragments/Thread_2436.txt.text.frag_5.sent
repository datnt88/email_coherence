1. the firmware must be the latest. 
2. vpn can stress many since they don't realize the &quot;rules&quot;. 
if you are on a vpn to work, you won't see your lan... 3. you may need a &quot;vpn router&quot; since some non-vpn-routers will only support... 1 connection at a time. 
4. if you installed a firewall in your pc, then you are very much on your own. 
i can't help you at all.
