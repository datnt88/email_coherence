i run two identical desktops [xp sp2] and have four external drives: one maxor one-touch ii and three seagate ides in $30 compusa cases. 
in deference to what i have read elsewhere, i agree completely with castingrod47: i have found no difference in the speed with which i can move, access, or edit data. 
i'm a photographer and work extensively in photoshop cs2. 
whether the image i am working on is on the c drive or one of the usb2 externals makes no difference whatsoever. 
regarding what markflax said about disconnecting, i have never used add/remove hardware when swapping a drive from one system to the other. 
most externals are plug and play and are designed to function in that manner, like a digital camera or card reader. 
i just power down the drive on machine a, disconnect the power and usb connections and move to machine b--with the seagate/compusa drives i've never had an instance where either system did not immediately recognize the drive. the one touch ii is actually the most finicky and sometimes is not recognized immediately, which is why i use it exclusively for retrospect backups on machine a. dg
