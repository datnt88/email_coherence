i think the 7 day return policy from the store is enough. 
if something wrong happens within those 7 days, just return it and exchange for a different one. 
went i got mine from bb, i left it on those 7 days w/o shutting it down to make sure that any problems possable would occur within the return. 
i believe that the 1 year warranty is enough and the store warranty is just for money. 
i've never used any of the warrantys on any of the pc's in my house let alone i never bought the store ones, so i saved myself money.
