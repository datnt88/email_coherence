fyi, my 13 month old e machine t6420 motherboard just died. 
also, fyi, my e machine notebook died last year after being only 18 months old. 
i don't think it would be smart to buy another e machine....nor to repair an existing e machine. 
since 1985 i've had desktops and notebooks from toshiba, compaq, hp, e machine, ibm, sony, etc...and has always been the cheapest price but has always died on me. 
all the other computers just got obsolete.
