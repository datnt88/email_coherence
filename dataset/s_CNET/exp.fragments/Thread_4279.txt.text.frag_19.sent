about about the light turning stable after only 2 or 3 flashes? 
i've tried everything, even formatting it again to fat32. 
i've also tried doing it with a different update, i really wish i could save $15 and not have to buy another bios chip, then have to pay someone to put it in (because i have no idea how to) but that is looking like the route i'm forced to take.
