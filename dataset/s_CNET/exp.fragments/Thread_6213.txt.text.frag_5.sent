dell computers rivet in there motherboard side case so only one side slips off to add new cards.the 
front panel which is blow molded plastic has to come off in order to replace the dvd drives. 
that being said i could no see the tabs or any screws holding it on after checking and rechecking, i said to myself screw it1. 
i took a medium blade screw driver and preyed the the front panel far enough out till i could get to the tabs which had six tabs.once 
you pry out the front take a small bladed screw driver and push back the tabs till the pop out (release from the hole) now be careful here there may be a screw holding it back!. pop each tab one on each side of the front panel if you do this and the next two are real tight to the case look again and see if there is a screw holding it will be on the serviceable side of the case after all people make mistakes and they have to remove the front panel at q/c if the drives they installed are bad. 
now you will be able to remove the screws from the drives.
