ok, a few months ago i bought a 108mbps netgear router with mimo. 
today i bought a 240mbps netgear wifi usb adapter. 
i just cant get my computer to accept a 54mbps+ connection. 
i have checked: drivers usb ports software router configuration router driver what can i do? 
my internal nic, which i didnt think had to do with anything get 1gbps.
