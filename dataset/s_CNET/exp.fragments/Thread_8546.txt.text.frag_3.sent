sorry to confuse you, thanks for replying to my post! 
my mac is connected to the modem, then connected to the router. 
then i a cat5 cable is connected going from the router, to the pc. i only have one router, everything is daisy chained to each other. the pc has cat5 cable that goes from the to the router to the pc's port. 
when i had the cable installed it was installed on my computer. 
all did to get the pc online was plugin a cat5 cable. 
i had to reset my router, and i think thats when the connection got lost on the pc. i tried a repair option in windows, is there a way i can tell is what its ip address should be?
