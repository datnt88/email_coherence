i have a pentium 4 with win xp home and a amd athlon also with win xp home on it and both are connected directly to high speed internet through a speedstream 6300 router/modem using the proper cables. 
i am trying to set up my home network so that i can use the same printer for both computers. 
i ran the win xp network setup wizard and made the network disk as requested and ran it on the second computer. 
i can view both computers as being shared in my network groups but when i try to access either one from the other computer i get a message saying that i do not have permission to access that server. 
i have set both up to share their hard drives and have even tried to reconfigure my router assuming that it might not recognize them. 
they both show up in my router settings as being on the same network. 
what can i do to gain permission to access the other computer? 
what could be preventing it? 
i have searched for help but most is for wireless, i am not using a wireless system. 
both computers have ethernet cards also. 
i have redone the setup several times and still have the same error. 
what could the problem be and could you please help? 
thanks a lot.
