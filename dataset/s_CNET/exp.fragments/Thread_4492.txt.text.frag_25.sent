things always change yet they don't. 
basically, while some things have gotten complex they do try to simply the guesswork and here it always doesn't go right. 
i'll use the example of &quot;jumpers&quot;. if you read the manual you need to jumper this way and that and then apply power. 
now, its gotten to be all s/w based or interactive. 
that might be good for the basic system, but too often users then try to maximize the setting, yada, yada and get into trouble. 
as for a psu, it used to be a simple wattage applied. 
now, not only wattage and amps, but all the dang connections, rails, safety and cooling. 
so, you see it gets more complex yet we're still dealing with the same bedrock components. 
i'm sorry for your problems, but i'll have to see it in person to get anything more out of it. 
i leave you for now. 
again, i suggest you review all the specs and how they compare to each other for a good pc build. 
take your time on your repair build and assure all is going as it suppose to be.
