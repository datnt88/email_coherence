i recommend to reinstall your windows with formatting your hard disk (with backup important files to extern hard disk). 
if you don't know how to backup your e-mails, accounts, faforites etc., i can help with it. 
if you have itstallation disks with your programms, you can always install it again. 
and number of programms will be less than now. 
it always worked for me. 
i did it many times. 
of coarse it takes a lot of your time, but result will be like you have a new pc advices about increasing ram are also very good. 
good luck!
