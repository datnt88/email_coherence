i bought my desktop in march and it started shutting down after a few weeks. 
after hours speaking with someone in india, i was finally transferred to a tier 2 tech in the us. 
i sent the computer back in june for &quot;warranty repairs&quot; - at a cost of over $100 for shipping, and got it back after they &quot;replaced a faulty hard drive&quot;. 
it's powered down a few times over the past couple of months and yesterday it wouldn't stay powered on more than a few minutes - not enough time to get through the recovery discs (this is usually the first thing tech support spits out for you to do when there is a problem). 
i went to the gateway support site and sent a message for support. 
they just came back and said that &quot;it appears to be a hardware issue. 
ship it to depot repair for further help&quot;. 
of course i'm not going to waste another $100+ to do that. 
after reading this forum, i monitored the cpu temp for awhile from the bios and saw that it was running right at 100 degrees f. i placed a small desk fan blowing into the vent and the temp went down a few degrees and i was then able to perform a recovery and it's been working great for the past few hours. 
my fan is usually rather loud and runs fast most of the time too - the same as many other posters on this thread. 
it's really apparent to me that the gateway support people are truly unaware of the overheating problem and their answer to everything is &quot;send it back&quot;. 
it would be wonderful if the bigwigs at gateway (acer now??) would monitor these forums and see that their customers are having these issues. 
i'm still going to talk to them about trying to get an upgraded fan or something else instead of sending it in for warranty service. 
i doubt i'll have much luck.
