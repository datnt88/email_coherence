when the linksys is hooked up to the modem and pc, there is no internet connection. the internet &quot;light&quot; is not coming on and when i try my browser it is not connected. 
can anyone tell me what i might try to fix this? the lights are on on the router so it appears to be functioning properly. 
i think these instructions, are correct but i can't get to the &quot;configure&quot; part where you go to the ip address online. 
can i configure that before i hook up the router maybe? 
thanks again for any help, denise
