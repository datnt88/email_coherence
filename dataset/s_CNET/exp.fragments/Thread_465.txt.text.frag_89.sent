its a home built pc, most of the machine is about a year old, but i have done some upgrades to it. 
when i first build the computer, i was running an dual core e6600, and a nvidia 8600 gts video card. 
i bought a better video card this march. 
a sapphire radeon 3850 hd, and in august, upgraded the cpu to a quad core q6600. 
other than those upgrades, its pretty much the same. 
still using xp pro for my operating system. 
tried vista, hated it, went back to xp.
