you are just using this for 2d so great calculations of polygons isn't an issue. 
from what i have read of the past few years is that ati is going to give you better images but nvidia is going to give greater speed. 
going with one of their top end cards is overkill for what you are using it for. 
ati x600 is great and not too expensive.
