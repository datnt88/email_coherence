definitely, no matter what, don't ever put wires behind the motherboard!!! most motherboards have little points from the solder spots on the back side. 
i have seen cases where those points actually penetrated the wires and caused a short-circuit which burned the mobo and the processor! the only recommendation is to tape loose wires together. 
for example, the 4 wires which bring power to various components can be taped to form a single cable. 
use different colors for identification.
