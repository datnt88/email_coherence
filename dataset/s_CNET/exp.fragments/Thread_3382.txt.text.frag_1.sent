i am building a pc to mainly work with raw image converters, photoshop and create dvd slideshows, so a bit of graphic work, but not really any 3d stuff. 
firstly, can someone suggest a decent motherboard with intel 775 socket and 1066mhz fsb that would do the job. 
looking at around $150 us (&lt;$200 aus would be good) secondly, is there any need for a graphics card with the integrated graphics included with the motherboard and what is a good card to go for? 
cheers, alex
