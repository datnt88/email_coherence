not a computer expert by anymeans. 
but i did do some brief research on the 680s because they are such a new product. 
one thing of note is that they are extremely power efficient. 
that entire build could probably be absolutely fine with a much lower power supply then a 1050 watt. 
find a calculator somewhere on the internet and see what it takes to run that build with two gtx 580's. 
i bet it is still under 1050 watts and the 680s are i think use like 30-40%less power meaning you would be fine with a 800-900 watt psu. 
other then that where is this computer coming from? 
i'm in the market for a new computer and am 2 lazy to build
