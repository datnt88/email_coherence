i have a ton of old family photos to scan into my computer. 
very few have negatives but a few do. 
most are just the photos. 
my question is. is there a scanner that has an auto feeder that will work with photos? 
i didn't know if they made one. 
i know they have document feeders but wasn't sure if it would damage photos. 
thanks for your time.
