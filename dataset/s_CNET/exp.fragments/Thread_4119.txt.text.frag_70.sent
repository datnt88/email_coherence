i had symptoms - twice - like those described. 
after a lot of noodling around the first time, i took the bitter pill of wiping and reinstalling windows and everything else. it didn't work. 
but that act alone gave me new data which helped me realize that the vid card had lost its 3-d handling only and it had reverted to vga, which still worked. 
my card was under warranty and easily replaced. 
a few years later i saw the same behavior. 
armed with my experience, i bought a replacement card for my now rather elderly pc and immediately all was restored. 
the important take-away here is that the vid card would still run, but when it tried to do 3-d gaming it became a slide show and colors etc. varied from what i expected. 
other commentators have focused on things you might have done to create your problem. 
i think if you had done something and it seemed to cause the change, you would have told us. 
i think it was nothing you did - just a partial hardware failure.
