a group of co-workers on a project share all our information using dropbox. 
we each have a connection to dropbox on our computers, tablets or phones. 
we all save anything related to our group project into the shared dropbox and then everyone else can access it. 
it seems to work well. 
and i know of other groups who also use it. 
there are other similar programs/aps whatever we call them these days - but this is the main one i have worked with.
