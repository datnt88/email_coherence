have you been reading about the new atom n2600 and n2800 chips for netbooks? 
they are supposed to run on only 3.5 and 6.5 watts and work fanless (i've been searching many sites as well as it's interesting reading about them). 
it will be interesting to see how well they'll perform compared to my amd c-60 netbook...
