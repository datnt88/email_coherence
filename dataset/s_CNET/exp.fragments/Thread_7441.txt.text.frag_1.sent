hello there, on a abit / amd mobo, running win 2000, i recently installed some new software, but it was at least a few weeks after that i noticed slow performance. 
i have 3 hard drives. 
c: drive is always fine. the d: drive failed a diagnostic test, so i removed it. the e drive (device &quot;1&quot; on the secondary ide channel), keeps slipping out of ultra dma into slower pio mode. 
i replaced this drive too just to be sure, but the problem is not fixed. 
it keep slipping into pio mode. 
i can work around this by uninstalling (under ide controllers in device manager) the secondary ide channel. the driver / device reinstalls on startup, it goes back to ultra dma mode for a while. 
but this only holds up for a few days then it slips back to pio mode. 
any advice on how to fix this?? is it software or hardware related? 
is it a prob with my mobo? 
i'm really stumped. 
thanks - fj
