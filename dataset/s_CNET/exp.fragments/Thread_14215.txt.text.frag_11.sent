i have windows 2000 with an amd 2800 chip and a7v8x mobo. 
i can boot off the sata only if i have no ide drives attached. 
there is no option on the mobo to boot from sata. 
so i'm going to have to upgrade to be able to boot from sata and add back all my ide drives. 
i haven't found an upgrade for the mobo so i can make the sata (wd raptor) my boot drive. 
any other ideas out there? 
thanks, laurie
