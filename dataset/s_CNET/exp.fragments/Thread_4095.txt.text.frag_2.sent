my via cyrix 733mhz is below that, but i put on 512mb of ram and it plays dvds fine. 
that 128mb ram is about 1/2 what i would try for dvd playback. 
also, not a word in your post about os, etc so go get a geexbox (hint: google.com) 
cd and see if that plays your dvd. 
i don't offer any support for this since it's all documented on the web.
