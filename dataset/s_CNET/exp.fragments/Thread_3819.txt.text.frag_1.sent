hi all. 
i had a few issues with my belkin router, and not really knowing what i was doing, i fiddled around and enable the &quot;configure router as access point&quot; option. 
i now have an issue where some, but not all, wired devices can access the internet, and i've no wifi access at all. 
this is only temporary, as i'm getting a new wireless n modem/router from my isp, but this won't be for approx 4 weeks. 
in the meantime, how can i log onto the router's settings and disable the access point only? the previous ip of 192.168.1.0 has now been altered. 
current setup: scientific atlanta epc2100 cable modem belkin f5d8236-4 router pc (vista &amp; ubuntu gnu/linux)- able to connect over ethernet on both os's ps3 - able to connect over ethernet laptop (xp) - unable to connect either with or without network switch (shared with below) laptop (osx) - unable to connect either with or without network switch (shared with above). 
any thoughts?
