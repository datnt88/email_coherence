i see. 
i was under the impression the machine you already owned was going to her. 
if you could, and don't mind, posting a link to this pc or the nameversion and price so i can better evaluate what you are paying for. 
i don't typically give out advice about brands but i will say, emachine is not usually one of my suggestions.
