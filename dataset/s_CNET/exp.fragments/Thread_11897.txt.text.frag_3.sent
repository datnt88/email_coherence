to make life easier, how about first clean up the old computer? 
you said that you tried to clean it, but i think you should use a more extreme method: 1. download spybot, adaware, microsoft anti-spyware beta, spysubtract (including cwshredder), and use them to do full-system scan. 
2. get hijackthis 3. scan a hijackthis log and post it on aumha forums ( ) 4. wait for reply. 
5. then follow the replies to clean out your computer. 
(usually will have a lot of steps, but you have to follow them word by word, or the malicious stuff won't go. recommended: after following the reply's directions, do another full system scan in safe mode.) hope this helps
