since you ask so &quot;tactfully&quot; , i'll respond candidly. 
i know as moderator you have the upper hand, and therefore consider yourself justified, but what i'd like is for you to stop picking on me. 
had you truly wanted to &quot;educate&quot; me, then in the other forum you'd have explained the name of the 4' cable i'm seeking as per my last response to you. 
instead, you chose to vilify me, why i don't know. 
why bother to give a &quot;villain&quot; useful info? 
instead you respond in ways which cause threads to drag out. 
that way, i can be accused of ranting. 
i challenge any other hopefully-objective third-party to read the above thread carefully, as well as the below link to my recent post, and decide who posted innocently, with a basic q, and who responded in an unwarranted way. 
but again, i know you have the upper hand, so regardless, you'll do as you wish. 
here's the link referred to above:
