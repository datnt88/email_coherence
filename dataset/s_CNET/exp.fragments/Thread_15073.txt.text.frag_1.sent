help please!! my dvd-rom drive(samsung-616e) has been giving me problems for a while now, and i finally decided to do something about it. 
not too long ago, when i inserted dvd's they would play then freeze up. the problem progressively got worse, and now it wont even recognize dvd's, but it still will play cds. 
i have tried cleaning the lense, reinstalling the drivers, reinstalling my dvd player program, and i have searched through other posts and tried changing the settings for the ide contollers, deleting the upper and lowers in the registry and still no avail.....any professional help out there would be greatly appreciated.
