i just purchased this device (external usb 2.0 & firewire sony dw-u22a 16x dual layer dvd+-r/rw drive) and tried to install the driver prior to connecting the drive. 
first off, i have win xp home and the driver prompted me that the driver was for win98. 
secondly, it is showing up in &quot;my computer&quot; as a zip drive with only 35 mb of space. 
i did try doing a search to find an xp home driver but had no luck. 
nothing in the directions seemed to work. 
does anyone have this device and can help me? 
tia
