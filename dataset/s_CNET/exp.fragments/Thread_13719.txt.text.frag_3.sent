but for another person rather than myself. 
in this case, what we are seeing is the modem to randomly get out of sync and need to reconnect. 
it may cycle over and over. 
i can remove the router and connect the pc directly to the modem and it seems to be better. 
i put this other persons router on my own network and ran it for days without a hiccup. 
this person uses twc as well and i think it's at their end. the clues may be here i'm noting that the signal to noise ratio in the other modem is a much lower number than in my own. 
also, the power levels are significantly lower than mine. 
check your modem by going to it's interface with a web browser and see if you're well within these specs. 
if you have a motorola, the default ip is usually 192.168.100.1. 
good luck.
