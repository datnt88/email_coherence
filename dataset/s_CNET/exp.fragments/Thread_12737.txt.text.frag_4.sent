this is not an issue of too many users. 
what you may just be learning about is how wifi works. 
sure, what you asked can work but the gamers would grumble about ping times and the gamer with the wired connection would have the edge. 
i offered a solution to that. 
:could you help me to set-up a lan with the stuff which i already have?: sure, just do what the manuals told you to do.
