&quot;i've only tried a combination of pci cards and i thought this should work because i know others who have used a setup like what im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue?&quot; 
yes. 
i did have a few dual pci card setups. 
all were combos like a pair of ati cards that had the needed dual display capable drivers or a pair of matrox millenium cards. 
been there, done that. 
it's all in the cards and drivers.
