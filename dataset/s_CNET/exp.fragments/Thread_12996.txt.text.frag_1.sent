i was accessing my home lan on my notebook computer. 
something happened and as i tried to connect to the network i got an error message saying &quot;it can't access the network and that i may not have permission and may need to contact the administrator.&quot; it was working fine before and i'm sure i didn't do anything to change permission. 
what does this mean and how do i go about connecting to the network? 
also, on the laptop i see the other computers in network neighborhoon but i don't see the laptop when using the other computers. 
i have never done anything do &quot;add&quot; the laptop, perhaps that's the problem. 
thanks for your help.
