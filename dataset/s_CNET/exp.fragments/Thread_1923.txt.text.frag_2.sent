if you mean an internal mini-pci wireless network adapter that is found in many notebooks, go for it! 
i like them better than external wireless network adapters (usb, pc-card/pcmcia). 
range is good, no hardware to lose, keeps usb ports free. 
check with your notebook mfg to see what mini-pci card they recommend. 
newegg.com 
sells them, too.
