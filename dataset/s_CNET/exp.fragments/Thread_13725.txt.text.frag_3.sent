i have had a netgear r6300 for about a year now. 
there have been 8 to 10 devices attached at one given time with no lapse or drops in performance. 
i use a setting that will not allow other devices attach without permission. 
the band i use is on a 5ghz frequency which has less traffic and no wireless overlap. 
i also have the advantage of being close to my provider within the coverage area. 
if you router allows for the 2.4ghz and 5ghz selection, you may want to opt for the 5ghz less traffic setting. 
also make sure your firmware is up to date. 
netgear has a windows 8 beta driver you may want to get for the windows 8 os. 
i hope this helps.
