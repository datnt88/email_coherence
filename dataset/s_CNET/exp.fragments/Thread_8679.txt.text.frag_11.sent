no other apple brand has become the generic name for it's class of gadget. 
apple gets more buzz, but designs, advertises and markets their technology so as to avoid becoming a commodity, or the generic name. 
pc is the generic name, not mac. 
it's a phone, not an iphone. 
it's probably more likely that all tablets/e-readers will be called kindles.
