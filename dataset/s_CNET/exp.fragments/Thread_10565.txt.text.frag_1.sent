i have a nick in the protective coding on my monitor's screen. 
its in a really annoying place and often inturrupts my work. the screen is a mitusbishi diamond pro 900u. is there a way to fix this? 
i know there is a type of chemical you can drop on the casing that turns a small area of plastic into a moldable clay-like material that later hardens as it dries, and products that repair cd's using a chemical. 
there must be something i can buy that can fix this. 
does anyone know of such a product? 
thanks in advance, dave
