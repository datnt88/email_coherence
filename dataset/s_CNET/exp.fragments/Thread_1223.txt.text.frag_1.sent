back in feb my compaq presario 7599 hard drive crashed. 
i was running windows 98 and bought the computer in 2001. 
i got the blue screen of death. 
when i tried to boot off the floppy, it went into a diagnostics and there was a problem with the fat32 file (or something like that). the only solution was to reformat the hard drive. 
since the computer was from 01, i decided to postpone the issue and buy a new pc. 
so i bought an hp media center pc m470n running windows xp. recently i put the old compaq hard drive into the hp to see if i could read the file system and salvage my old files. the hp ran a diagnostics and fixed the problem with the old hd. i was successful in copying my old files onto my new pc. 
i wanted to have a 2nd pc so i put the hard drive back into the compaq. 
now when i turn on the compaq, it doesn't boot up. 
i can hear the hard drive engage, but the monitor is drak and the keyboard is unresponsive. 
i tried booting off the cd and the floppy, but with no luck. 
i double checked and the hard drive still works in the new hp. 
any suggestions to get the hard drive working in the compaq again? 
thanks, bruce
