help ! 
in an attempt to install xp pro sp2 in my desktop i have always the same problem for which i find no solution! 
until this day i have bought 3 (three) installation disks (2 x oem and 1 retail) to no avail. the items appearing under other peripherals are simply not available ! 
i have managed to find an ethernet adapter file in order to access internet for a possible help: consequently i have no audio or video nor multimedia peripherals and no indication why and where to possibly download them. 
why this phenomenon ? the rest of the installation shows no problems at all ! 
many thanks !
