i had a conflict with irq's, and had to move the internal card to another slot. 
sounded like fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads to me when tech support told me to do it, but it worked. 
had to reinstall all the drivers too. 
on the upside, i finally found out how to get my optical spdif to put out more than just a stereo signal... woohoo! 
thanks
