laptop: windows 7 pro desktop: windows 7 pro -external hd i currently have all my files on my laptop being backed up over the network to an external hd. i would like to purchase a portable hd to put older files that i'm not currently using onto. 
so on my internal hd i would have my important everyday files. 
i would like to have my internal hd and the portable hd backed up automatically to the external hd. any suggestions?
