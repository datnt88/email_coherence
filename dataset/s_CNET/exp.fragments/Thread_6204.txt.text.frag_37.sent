it seems that messages on this thread do not get delivered in chronological order. 
i don't know about the dates - i do know that i thought i read the whole thread before commenting and then a couple of days later i got an notify email citing your reply. 
sorry! 
oh well - at least we got the message out about team viewer. 
i set that up before my nat's ftp server. 
both are useful but the nat uses less power and is always on. 
like i mentioned - if team viewer did wake on lan - then it would be complete - then i could remotely access my computer whenever. 
now i just need a good sync solution - like ifolder!
