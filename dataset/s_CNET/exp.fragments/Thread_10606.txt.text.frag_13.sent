it's a pity they don't send to your country. 
maybe the shop where you bought this machine help you to find something that works. 
there might be a recovery partition on the hard disk. 
if no help from the shop or the local tech, see if leads to a solution. 
if not, better buy an original dvd. 
be sure you have or can download from hp.com all needed drivers for the os you choose. 
that might be difficult.
