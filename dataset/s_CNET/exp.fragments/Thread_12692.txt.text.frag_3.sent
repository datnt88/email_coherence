seems it may be the card andor didn't install correctly.typically 
you install the driver first before the card goes in. 
could be some chipset updating needed. 
if you installed your drivers and card correctly and you still have your onboard video enabled, this can cause a reboot. 
however, if you disable the onboard and have issues, you may lose your video altogether and your option would be to pull the cmos batter for a reset or fumble around in the dark hoping you remember how to reset the settings without screen.
