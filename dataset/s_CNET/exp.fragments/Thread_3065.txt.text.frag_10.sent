this system is woefully underpowered for xp, but it should be a bit faster than what you are describing. the 48mg of missing memory is an attention getter, but it may be the video reserve making the difference. 
if you have any extra compatible memory, even in a different system, use it to temporarily check out this possible issue by installing it in the same slot now occupied and seeing what is reported. 
then move it to the adjacent slot and check again. 
do the same with the old memory and compare. 
this will tell you if you have a bad memory stick or a bad slot. 
i believe that belarc reports all system memory and where it is installed. 
also make sure that the hard drive is not on the same ide ribbon as any optical drive. the ide channel will adjust itself to the slowest hardware on the ribbon, matching the hard drive to the (probably 33) speed of the optical drive. 
when you are using the page file at the rate that this system does you can really bottleneck things this way. 
this is something often overlooked, or not known, to someone doing upgrading or adding a second optical drive. 
many think that transfer is faster if both optical and hard drive are on the same ribbon, missing the synchronization issue. 
this system obviously needs to be pared down to the bare essentials for running processes at any time. 
things like smartcard and ups are probably not needed. 
look over the processes for any fluff and set to manual or disable. 
you can also apply a simple tweak to speed up the file search time. 
from the start menu click &quot;run&quot;. 
type &quot;cmd&quot; and hit enter. 
type &quot;net stop stisvc&quot; to stop the process. 
then type &quot;sc config stisvc start= disabled&quot; to disable it at startup. 
(type them exactly as shown here without the &quot;.) reboot and check for any improvement.
