i didn't expect the event viewer to show problems; instead, looking at the &quot;times&quot; between each event, perhaps there is some clue as to what is causing this delay between logged events. 
bob's idea is good. 
what running security programs are there on this system besides the anti-virus? 
for example we find many xp users still using spybot search &amp; destroy with it's teatimer component running in the background, or lavasoft's adaware with it's adwatch component running in the background and with today's anti-virus scanners those components often cause conflict. 
which anti-virus is being used? 
are any 'optmizers' or 'registry cleaners' being used? 
we often find those can cause problems.
