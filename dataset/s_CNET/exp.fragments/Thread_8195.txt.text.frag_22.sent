thanks jenifer! 
i have been having this same problem for months now. 
i tried uninstalling both scanner and software, installing new drivers, pretty much all of the advice posted here earlier on. 
i tried plugging in a ne poer supply out of desperation (after seeing your post) and poof! 
works like new, or rather like it used to. the power supply looks to be a uhi power adapter.thanks!!!
