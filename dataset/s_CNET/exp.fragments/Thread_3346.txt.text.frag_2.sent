with no os mentioned, i can't tell you any direct actions, but for xp, firewalls are the number 1 reason i see people fail at making a network. 
next are things like. 1. didn't install drivers. 
2. invalid configurations (example? 
cable modem to hub, pcs to hub, no router) 3. didn't ask the user account to the xp machine and the client... has most of this. 
i don't duplicate that content here.
