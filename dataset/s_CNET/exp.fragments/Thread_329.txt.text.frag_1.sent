i am trying to see if anyone else has this problem. 
i am a two finger typer, but type fairly fast. 
i write a lot on my computer, every day. 
generally, i look at the keyboard when typing. 
i also tend to type hard, but this issue is there even when i try to type softer. 
my problem is that i'll type a paragraph and then look up to proof my text and a significant number of characters are missing. 
this has continued with three different systems and multiple keyboards (wired and wireless). 
apparently, the problem is me, but i am still fascinated by this matter. 
i spent a tremendous amount of wasted time adding characters that are missing. 
given i type with two fingers, and i stare at the keyboard, i cannot fathom how so many characters do not appear. 
so far on this posting, i have had to add five missing characters. 
just imagine how many corrections i have to make in a year. 
this single problem must cost me days of wasted time. 
if you have any suggestions, i am open to anything. 
i have even thought of filming my typing to assure i hit each key, but could not get a good camera angle. 
i would need to use at least two cameras. 
anyone else experiencing this?
