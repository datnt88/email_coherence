i have a really old pentium 233, 160 ram, pcchips motherboard self-built computer.during the last year the screen has a tendency to go black (blank) at any time for no reason at all. the only way to fix it is to restart the computer and even then it takes quite a while for the image to come back. 
it usually comes back during the scandisk that is done before windows starts when it's restarted abrupty. the system itself doesn't freeze, but of course i can't do anything without being able to see the screen. 
the screen is a techmedia 15''. the video card is a cirrus logic 5546. the components of the computer are all rather generic. 
here's where the question goes. 
i don't know what is causing this. 
tightening the cables hasn't worked. 
i don't know if the problem is due to the screen or the video card. 
this is what i would like to know. is it the screen or video card causing this problem? 
any possible solutions? 
i'd really appreciate if you all could help me with this because it's driving me and my family crazy.
