of course they are connected to the wan port... all 3 routers are connected to a switch that is connected to the access point... to make it simpler: when i connect 3 laptops on lan with static ip it works perfectly, when i connect 3 routers instead with same static ip. all three doesnt work... is there anything else i should configure in the routers? 
maybe assign each a different dhcp range ?
