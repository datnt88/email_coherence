a few days ago a purchased a seagate 160 gb external usb 2.0 hard drive. 
i did some speed and access time tests (sisoft sandra) which showed the drive was at least as fast as my internal drive. 
i converted the drive to ntfs (it comes as fat 32) and then moved my documents across from my c: drive (about 80 gb). 
i have been using it for several days and have not noticed any degradation in performance at all. the big advantage i see is that not only have a freed up a lot of space on my c: drive, i have all my data on an external drive which can be easily ported around if needed. 
obviously, i still carry out regular backups to cd / dvd as i have always done.
