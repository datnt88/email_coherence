i have a gateway performance 1600 pc, xp home, 512 mb ram, p4. i can't get into the bios setup to see why i am getting a keyboard error on boot. the keyboard works fine and shows up in the device manager correctly. 
i just did a clean install of my os (it is actually installed as an upgrqade to me). 
i had the keyboard problem before the reinstallation.. the manual says to press and hold f1 during restart. 
i tried with a restart and a cold boot. 
i don't see anything about entering setup on the screens that flash by during the bootup process. 
any suggestions? 
thanks kay
