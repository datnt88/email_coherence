-&gt; while i do see the drivers i also see is the the pentium 4 laptops that we saw so much trouble with over the past few years. 
these machines are favorites because they can rack up quite the repair bill. 
why not cut your losses and install as a test this card? 
-&gt; you can get that one new on amazon.com if you want but i've been using these on machines like yours after the owner has caved in and has finally admitted defeat. 
i know some don't want to call it quits and i know better than to replace that internal card.
