i just purchased a &quot;msx-m4gst/x&quot; memory stick, and i've immediatly got a blue screen of death from it. 
after some investigation i've determined this stick is a counterfeit, and a very good one at that. 
there is a guide here which explains the counterfeit chips: i purchased mine on ebay so i'm going through the process of getting a full refund from the seller.
