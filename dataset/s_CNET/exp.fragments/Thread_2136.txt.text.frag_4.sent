compressed air is going to blast all the dust into the air (and possibly your eyes), it's best to use a vacuum cleaner with a small nozzle on the end of the tube. 
much of the dust in a computer (and general house dust - especially the mattress on your bed) contains a huge amount of dead skin... and the bugs that eat it... and their droppings (poo...) - we change our skin every 28 days or so but not all in one piece like a snake. 
it is very bad to inhale that stuff but please do clean out the pc and all the vents (in and out) regularly. 
if it still runs hot, get an extra fan to fit the inlet vent inside the pc and this will help to suck more air (and dust) into the areas that need cooling - make sure it blows in the correct direction... if your power supply (psu) fan blows out, the extra fan must blow in - and vice-versa. 
as linkit has already said, remove the cpu fan to get at the cooling fins (put it back on the same way it came off...!!). a pastry brush, from a cooking shop, makes a brilliant job of cleaning fins and is an excellent addition to any pc toolkit... but don't borrow one from your wife... she'll kill you if she finds out what you've used it for.
