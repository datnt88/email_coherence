i can't even begin to speculate as to what the problem was. it seems unlikely that there would be a conflict, of some sort, with classic as your device should work under os 9 as well as os x. it &quot;might&quot; be interesting to see if the firewire connection now works also, but, it may also be better to let sleeping dogs lie. 
glad you have a working burner at last, merry christmas.
