to each their own decision. 
but, let's be clear here, there are many users of 500gb, and 1tb now hds. 
you're own answer offered 3x1tb as a solution, i'm sure for others it'll be a 3tb hd. as time goes by, while fairly common now, 1tb is already starting to give way to 2tb and that wasn't too long ago, some pie in the sky. 
while on the subject, persistent releases of ssd's are qrowing as well. 
so, a typical current 250gb hd maybe replaced by a 250gb ssd as costs go down.
