i did furmark benchmarking yesterday night too, several times and it did the same as my games did, tried to reboot and then rebooted. 
then this morning i swapped my dvi-duallink cable to the other plug on the card and it's here it gave me error message instead of the shutdown. 
i've read on the internet people say this is fixable, because windows can't go with these rendering speeds, not sure if this would actually help though. 
also, i'm running windows 7 prof. 
64bit and got me thinking, maybe by upgrading to win8 would help this, if it's a win7 & nvidia driver that's colliding thanks in advance.
