my mother's old acer aspire had 64mb of ram, and uses a 335mb chip. 
i replaced one of the ram &quot;sticks&quot; (32mb) with a 128mb stick. the speed-up is awesome! 
can't say what changing the chip will do, but i think a new chip is a lot of money compared to buying a new ram stick (128mb for $59.95).
