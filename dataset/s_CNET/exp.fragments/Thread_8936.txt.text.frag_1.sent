i currently own and use 3 separate external hard drives. 
at the moment, due to limited desk space they are stacked on top of each other. 
these are all pre-bought drives, and i don't want to fiddle with opening them up etc, but i am looking for a &quot;rack&quot; or some kind of storage option to separate them with shelves or something to allow for better cooling. 
ideally, these shelves would have fans in them, similar to a laptop lap cooling device. 
does anyone know of any products like this? my google searches have failed so far. 
thanks.
