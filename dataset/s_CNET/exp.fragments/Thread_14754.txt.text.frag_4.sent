using ethernet cable directly to the modem or router, then the problem is not in the airport. 
you have to establish a connection to the internet first to rule out all the variables. 
shut down everything, modem/router/switches/airport/computer. 
connect the computer directly to the modem. 
make sure the computer is set to expect an ip address via dhcp or if you are using pppoe, that everything in that section is correct. 
connect should be via built-in ethernet. 
bring them back up in the same order, waiting for each one to become ready before firing up the next one. 
once the modem and computer are back up, try to get on-line. 
take a look at the network preferances pane and see if the computer has an ip address. 
if it starts with 169, shut it all down and try again.
