there are buckets of discussions about broken pcs and here's the bottom line. 
there is no exact process to fix a dead pc. sure we could take the old swap it piece by piece approach but let's upgrade that a little. 
1. some parts are not needed to boot. 
a keyboard, cd/dvd drive, and then one stick of ram. 
2. when swapping parts and no one knows which is bad, i have advice for our techs. 
ready? 
it's a wowser. 
-&gt; change the cheapest part first.
