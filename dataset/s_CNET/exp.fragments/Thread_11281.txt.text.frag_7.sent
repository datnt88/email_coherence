higher rated big named brand cd-dvd drive like plextor, sony, pioneer, etc.,. stick with quality optical media and use mainstream software too. 
using cheap drives, non-brand-name drives, cheap/bargain media and no name sw could lead to poor results for the long run. 
re optical drives drives....i use mostly plextor and like them because they always work for disc writes and reads (in other drives) and they update the drive firmware periodically to address anomalies observed or reported by users. 
for cd-dvd software, i use roxio and have always been pleased with it. 
let us know what you decide on on how it works.
