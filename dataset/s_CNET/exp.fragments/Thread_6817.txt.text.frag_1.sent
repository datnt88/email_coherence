hi, i hope someone out there can help me with a problem i am having upgrading my computer with some extra ram. the pc currently has two 512mb sticks and is running a bit slow, so i bought two 1gb sticks to help out. 
when i put them all in and turned the pc on, the machine seemed to be booting up (lights, fans and what not) but the monitor was staying asleep. 
i have tried the memory sticks in all manner of different combinations, as well as simply putting one of the new sticks in on its own, but with no luck. 
i suspected that the new memory must be dodgy, so i tried some memory from another pc which i knwo works, but the same problem occurred... am i overlooking something obvious here? the old memory: 2x 512mb ddr400 ram (both manufactured by crucial) the new memory: 2x 1gb ddr400 ram (both manufactured by samsung) the motherboard: ga-k8n pro-sli hope i've given all the necessary info. 
any ideas? 
many thanks in advance soundproof
