yes i have set up group policy's and when they log-in to the work station its not restricting them. 
i currently run a vt program in a federal prison. 
so i have certain inmates i wanna restrict from certain things. 
i also have tutors which are inmates and want them to have more flexability. 
when i create a user and attach the group policy to them. 
when they log in to the work station they are'nt restricted. 
i can put a work station policy and restict everyone. 
but i thought a group policy would follow with the inmates account to any computer he would log in on. 
hope this helps you understand better.
