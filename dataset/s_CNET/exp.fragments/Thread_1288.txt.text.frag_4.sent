geeksquad told me to go to the device manager and unintall the dvdrw drive then restart the pc. xp will detect it and install the drivers. the problem i'm having now is it won't detect blank dvds. 
i burned a blank cd this morning but still won't detect blank dvds. 
i burned the bios update for the motherboard from emachines. 
i'm hesitant to use it because they say the update is if you use an invivia card. 
i have an ati radeon 1300.
