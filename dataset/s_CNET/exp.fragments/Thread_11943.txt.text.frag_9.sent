when i'm trouble shooting the setting is off or disabled. 
your new techs tend to not get why we do that and stumble for days as the firewall blocks their efforts. 
-&gt; keep in mind we are on a lan behind a nat router so only the new networker seems to ask why we turn off the firewall on the lan machines. 
i'll keep trying but i'd like to read about how you set up the printer share, if the workgroup names are the same and well, in short, what web page did you consult to set up the printer share? 
lastly, a few printers do not support printing over the lan. 
i read epson but no model number so i can't check into that. 
i don't want to upset you but without the details we end up with a lot of posts. 
try adding these details. 1. how did you share the printer. 
2. what epson.
