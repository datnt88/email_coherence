find an ethernet card, either online or some local vendor. 
they're very common and see no great hassle getting one. 
understand once you connect to the adsl link &quot;you are part of a network&quot; or lan, in this case a wan. 
and yes, the ethernet connection will be much faster than usb. 
you'll want a pci type ethernet card.
