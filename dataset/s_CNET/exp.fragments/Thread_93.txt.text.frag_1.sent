i have comcast cable with a motorola surfboard modem model sb5120 installed 6/25/2005 so it's 5 years old now. 
it goes to an alphashield then to a neatgear wgt624v2 router. 
a couple times a day it will disconnect. the internet will slow down and then some of the lights will go out. 
only lasts a minute or two then it will be ok and the lights will be steady. 
does that sound like the modem going out or a comcast problem? is 5 years pretty old? or could it be my alphashield or router?
