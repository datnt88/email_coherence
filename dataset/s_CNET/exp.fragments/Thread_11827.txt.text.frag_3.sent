in combination with a call to the makers helpline i was able to access the firmware directly on the router and reset the channel. 
i never had a clue that there were different broadcast channels [like a phone] and of course this makes sense. it fixed the problem so i can connect from my ibm laptop, but my sony still does not work - it shows the network and connects automatically then disconnects about 2 seconds later. 
it flips back anf forth, connected -- diconnected every couple of seconds. 
any ideas?
