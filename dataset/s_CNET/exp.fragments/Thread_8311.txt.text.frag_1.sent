i have had this for a couple of years now without problems. 
all of a sudden the scanning and copying options are a major headache. 
every time i try to copy or scan a page, the image/copy comes out with an approx 3 inch wide black bar that runs the length of the page. 
printing isn't a problem, therefore i am assuming that it's something to do with the actual scanning hardware. 
any help or advice will be gratefully appreciated. 
ps. if there's a way i can attach an example, please let me know.
