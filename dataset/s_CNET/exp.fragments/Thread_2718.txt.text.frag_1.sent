i have an asus p4p800-vm micro atx mainboard with 4 rear panel usb 2.0 and two internal usb 2.0 headers. 
i have a usb 2.0 all in one card reader (3.5 floppy, sd, sm, cf, etc...) connected to one of the internal headers and an additional two ports on the front of the case connected to the other internal header. 
i keep getting a balloon popping out of the toolbar (win xp) saying the device can perform faster, when i click on the balloon it gives me a list of available 2.0 ports but does not identify the component that &quot;can perform faster&quot; i suspect it is the media reader. 
why is this happening when there is no 1.1 usb anywhere on my system? 
how can i identify the component that needs to perform faster? 
thanks
