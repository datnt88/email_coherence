this is my aunts computer, she brought it to me in the state it is in. 
i cleaned it out with an air compressor, but that couldn't have caused whats going on as nothing has changed in the way it is behaving. 
there are no beep codes whatsoever, hitting the f8 key after powering up does nothing, the processor fan seems to be stuck on high, but that may be it's normal speed. the first thing i did after cleaning it out was to unconnect, and reconnect all cables, the video, and sound are all on-board. 
there is only one card (other than ram) in the mobo, it has a green &quot;line&quot; phone type jack in the back, and the ethernet is also on-board. 
i was hoping this was just a virus that may have messed up the hd, and a new one may get it working? 
her kids use it, and are always getting malware on it. 
i hope this gives you enough info, if you need more just ask. 
thank you.
