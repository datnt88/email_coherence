it works well with other wi-fi connections. 
before here, i had my own router and modem that worked. 
it was a different model linksys with a different isp. 
that just makes this all the more confusing. 
it's not worth it for me to send the my lappy in to get fixed. 
everything else works and i can still connect with an ethernet. 
i'll default windows firewall settings. 
i'll also try to default whatever other settings i can, since it seems to be this specific computer. 
thank you everyone for your help! if it does end up working, i'll post why.
