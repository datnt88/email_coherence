i think dell says if u don't use their ram your warranty will be void but i'm guessing that's not a problem. 
if you go to then click &quot;scan my system&quot; it will show you the max ram, how many slots, what u have and what type you need. 
their prices are not bad. 
i'd shop around though. 
i recently went shopping for 1gb of ram at it cost $79 at staples, too much. 
i found the same thing at circut city for $29. 
just make shore you copy the info when you buy it such as how many pins it has. 
good luck
