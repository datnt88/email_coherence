i have two samsung nc-10 netbooks, one for myself and one for my wife, along with three other fujitsu standard notebooks. 
the samsungs have become our main use machines. 
they will last for +/- 5-6 hours with the 6 cell battery. 
this of course, includes utilizing power saving features enabled and tweaked for reasonable power conservation, and not having your screen up over the 2nd from the dimmest setting, which i find more than acceptable. 
in fact the brightest setting is too bright for my preferences. 
there are also aftermarket 9 cell batteries available (+/- $65.) which may give you an additional 1.5 - 2 hours or so when it's time to replace the original. 
if you set it up to go into standby when you close the lid between uses, you should have no problem achieving your time/usage goal of +/- 5-6 hours, and will probably have power to speare. 
samsung has several updates to this original machine, including the nc-12, the nc-20 and others. 
they run from about $340. 
- $500. 
on amazon, last time i checked. 
i did upgrade the ram in both from the original 1 gb to 2 gb at an addtional $23. (?). i wouldn't trade my samsung netbook for anything!
