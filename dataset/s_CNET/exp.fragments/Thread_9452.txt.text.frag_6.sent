hi i have tried 2 new psu, first one colors 500w: didn't make any different. the second one corsair 400w: has made significant change to my system! the gxf still doesn't display anything on the screen but now, the windows xp doesn't starts at all!! when it gets to the point where the windows xp logo appears it restarting the system again. 
when i've came back to the old psu and the old gfx the situation is the same it gets to the point where the windows xp logo appears and it restarting the system again. 
do you know what is wrong now??
