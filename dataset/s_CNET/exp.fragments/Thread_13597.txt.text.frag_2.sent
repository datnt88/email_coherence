but here's the gpu list i like. 
that 7750 should best the current gpu but be sure to check benchmarks. 
if you change the motherboard you are in for a lot more cost. 
power supply, os, etc. my added thought. 
unplug the modem if you don't use it. 
it's a few saved watts and you need every one of them.
