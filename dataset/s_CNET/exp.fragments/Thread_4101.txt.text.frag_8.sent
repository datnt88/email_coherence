the manufacture is evga. 
i didnt register it beofre 30 days after purchase and the 1 year is already up so i dont have any warrantys on it. 
could the card be causing the boot problem and when hte video messed up the sound messed up also which is on board. 
could the video card cause the sound to mess up and the booting/restarting problem. 
people have said the nv4_disp.dll 
sometimes isnt caused by the video card but i know its the main driver for it.
