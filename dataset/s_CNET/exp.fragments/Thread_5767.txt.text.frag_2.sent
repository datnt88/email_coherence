getting a 3dlabs or matrox card, not an nvidia or ati card something like this which is designed for what your doing, yes a more basic gpu like an fx 5200 would work, but that matrox provides higher color output (10-bit per channel vs 8-bit, it doesn't actually do much though) and true support for triple monitor, which would aid you for multitasking
