if you want a pc for multi-tasking, gaming and possibly the option to upgrade, i would suggest buying off well known computer builders, such as mesh, cube24/7 etc (uk companies) its worth a bit of research into the company if you are just searching it on the internet, but a good idea is to go into a magazine shop and look in a computing magazine, they normally have double page ads for computer builders. 
hardware wise - i would look for a core 2 duo/quad, 3gb/4gb/8gb if you want to go all out (ddr2), hdd would be up to you, you would need to know what sort of space you are going to use, 1tb+ should be fine.. and dont forget to make sure it comes with a keyboard, mouse and screen if you are not going to use your old ones. 
posting links to computer you have spotted would be good aswell, i would be happy to look at them and give you my opinion.
