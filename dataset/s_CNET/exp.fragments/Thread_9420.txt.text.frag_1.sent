please help. 
i just installed wifi wireless camera in the house. 
i validated that i can access and view video within home wifi network. 
however, i can't seem to access it remotely outside my home wifi. 
i follwowed the instruction - found my ip address xxx.xx.xx.xxx : 85 and set port forwarding to 85 to ip camera.
