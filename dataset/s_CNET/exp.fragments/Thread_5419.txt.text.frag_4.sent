read someplace that the print head will over heat and shut down the printer. 
manufacturers designed obsolescence, to get you to buy a new mfc. 
my solution is to open up, be sure no paper jams etc. then shut down computer (xp), then power off everything - computer and printer. 
wait a couple of minutes, bring up power to printer, then restart computer, all is then well, till the next time, days or weeks, if you do not give it too big of a job. 
my first encounter was trying to print 200 pictures ( 4 of 4x5) per page on photo paper. 
after 10 pages, colors were krapp & i was at a loss then. 
mine is now fine - easier to shut it down for awhile than spend $$$$ on a new printer.
