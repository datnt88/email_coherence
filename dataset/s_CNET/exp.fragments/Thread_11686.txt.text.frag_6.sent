hey bob, thanks once again. 
i installed the new bios and that works fine, did not help my problem though : i did however try to run a test on my graphics card, called 'furmark' which is benchmarking the graphicscard to it's fullest and here i encountered my problem again! 
- it shut down after less than 30-45seconds, so i think it's my graphicscard that can not handle the high-end loads as in grid 2 and metro: last light. 
although my graphicscard is a 780 and should have no problem loading these games. 
and like i wrote at first, it has no problem with the game, besides this, it runs so nice and smoothly - untill it shuts down i'm not a 100% sure if this is actually the graphicscard. 
and do anyone know if this problem could have anything to do with the fact that i bought quad channel ram instead of dual - its 4 sticks, 16gb @ 2133mhz thank you in advance.
