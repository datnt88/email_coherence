thanks for those two links, bob. 
i don't think the logitech issue applies in this case. 
as i understand it, that was about a logitech optical mouse that was installed and conflicts that occurred with something called setpoint in a vista environment. 
my mouse was manufactured by microsoft; underneath it says, &quot;intellimouse serial and ps/2 compatible&quot;. 
any drivers that are installed on my system are windows xp's native drivers. 
i downloaded the malware scanners recommended on the other page to which you referred me, and scanned my system. 
a few suspect items were detected and deleted or quarantined, but it hasn't solved my mouse problem.
