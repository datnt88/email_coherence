thank you. 
i am hoping to make a decsion on my system by the end of the weekend. 
when you said: &quot;speeds don't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo (spd) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs.&quot; 
how do you do that? 
how do you adjust the specs to get the actuals?
