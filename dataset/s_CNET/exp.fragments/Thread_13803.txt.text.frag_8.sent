just wanted to let people here know that i fixed my hp m1270n. 
i bought a new powersupply and things are working perfect now. 
my power tester is only a 20pin and one 5volt was not lit (but i know that is normal with some powersupplies). 
i was sure happy to get it back up and running especially for ~40bucks. 
fyi - when cleaning the computers you should not blow the fans so they spin so fast as this generates power back to whatever it is connected to. 
you should hold the fan while blowing them.
