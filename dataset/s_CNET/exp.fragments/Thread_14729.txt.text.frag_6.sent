verify any video card is cooling well. 
see, if the fan(is there) is working 100% and cleaned of any dust build-up, etc.. reseat the video card as well. 
plus, if the problem persists, then get your hands on any other video card to test it even if a low-level one just to get beyond what maybe a video ram or heat problem of the video. 
you can place a household fan to blow on the video card and see what the result are. 
if it is a video problem then only replacing the card will do. 
if ytou have oc'ed the video then slow it down abit fby its direct s/w or use the bios or both areas. 
it certainly appears a video problem. 
either bad ram or weak video chipset. 
there's the outside chance apossible video driver update may help if driver related. 
again, simple video card replacement can test all this.
