i am using windows 98 and have just tried to install a new samsung cd rom drive sh-152. 
i checked and re-checked the internal connections very carefully. 
even after using the &quot;add new hardware&quot; wizard, windows did not find the new device to install it. 
however, the wizard is telling me that my system does have a pci universal serial bus comnnected but that this device is not installed and there is no driver for it. 
i have failed to find the driver. 
my questions are: 1) are these two problems related? 
2) do i need to re-install windows? 
3) anything else i might try any help from you boffins out there would be greatly appreciated.
