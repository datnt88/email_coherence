that helped in an odd way. 
we know that xp64 is the worst for getting a proper install today. 
it's early version would have deep issues with drivers and usb drives over a few gb. i strongly suggest you move to an os you can get support for and forget drive encryption if you can't keep an unencrypted backup around.
