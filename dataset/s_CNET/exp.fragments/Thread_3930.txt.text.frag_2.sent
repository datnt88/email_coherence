refresh rate etc exactly. 
there is a 20.4 samsung lcd. 
remember that with lcd monitors the diagonal size is exactly the size advertised, while the crt monitors are much smaller diagonally. the native resolution for the 20.4 samsung is 1600 x 1200, since ther are 3 [thinfilm transistors per [1 red, 1 green, 1 blue] pixel, there arte a total of 1600 x 1200 x3 elements in order to fill up the lcd screen. 
to use a lesser resolution the video/monitor circuitry runs an algotrithm to color the pixels that are not included in the resolution that you may use in order to still fill up the screen. 
tft's can not be turned on and off as fast as the pixels in a crt, however because they stay on when turned on [they do not decay the way that the crt phosphur does] they can't run at the high refresh rates but really don't need to since they stay colored until the next color change. 
possibly you should try to figure out exactly which parameters that are absolutely necessary for your application. 
that monitor has both an analog and a dvi input available.
