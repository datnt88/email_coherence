thanx for your help! 
i am not upset at all. 
just want to solve problem. 
my laptop is asus eee the only info i have on graphics card is nvidia ion. the wireless is nyrius aries. 
it consists of a transmitter and a receiver. 
the transmitter is a dongle that attaches to laptop with a hdmi male to laptop female and also to the usb input on the laptop for power. the receiver is a box that attaches to the hdtv via a male hdmi cable and to the wall a/c outlet. 
perhaps you can find it on google under nyrius aries hdmi wireless connection. 
that's where i bought it. 
i send them an email but they have not replied!
