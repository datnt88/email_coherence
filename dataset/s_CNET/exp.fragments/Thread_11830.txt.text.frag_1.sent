hi all this is a problem i have been wrestling with for some months. 
my system is a dell with amd dual core processor. 
operating system vista home premium. 
i stopped using ie some time ago as i found other browsers to be quicker. 
but some downloads will automatically open ie when they are trying to install them selves. 
then the fun begins!!!! it begins by opening a single page that opens for a few seconds then closes then opens and closes again. 
then 2 pages will do the same independent of each other, then 3, then more and more until my screen is a mass of ie pages open and closing randomly and i have no option but to close down and reboot. 
i have tried all sorts of remedies as follows: - i have tried uninstalling ie but the same thing happens with ie7 i have checked on the microsoft web site and they suggested running their online antivirus and anti spy scans which has done nothing. 
i have tried numerous other anti spyware, antivirus and general utility programs which do nothing. 
i have run out of ideas can any body help?????? neil liverpool england
