my husband swears (because of what some guy at office depot told him) that we need a card that is 512 mb instead of 256. 
he was told that since 256 was the minimum requirement for his game that it would not run as well with a 256 mb card and would be &quot;jerky&quot;. 
any advice on this? 
also, just for my info, what is the difference between a radeon 1950 and 1650??
