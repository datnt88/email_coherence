i just got my new philips 39pfl4208t/12 tv set. 
i noticed the initial settings where really messed up, especially the sharpness that made everything look very &quot;burned out&quot;. 
i am mainly using the display for gaming and as a pc monitor. 
my question is if there is any good method or program on how to set up the sharpness and colour and so on?
