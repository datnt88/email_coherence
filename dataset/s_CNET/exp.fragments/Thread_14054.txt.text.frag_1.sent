has anyone successfully installed and used 2 sata hard drives of different volumes, different manufacturers and different speeds as native hard drives with either vista or windows 7? i have tried to do this for about 3 months with 2 different mobos, different memory and different processors without success. 
here is what i have discovered so far. 
vista. 
vista, depending on mobo, wont always see both sata drives upon install. 
if it does see both drives and installs correctly when my computer is opened the 2nd (non-system) drive is listed as removable and cannot be accessed. 
solutions: use only 1 sata drive and partition, use 2 sata drives on raid (requires for best performance 2 identical drives) or use 1 ide drive and 1 sata drive (works for me). 
windows 7. w7 upon install detects all drives connected and installation is problem less. 
my computer displays both drives as local discs but when the 2nd drive (non-system) is accessed the computer freezes. 
restart after restart does not solve this problem. 
solutions: as with vista, use 1 sata and partition, use 2 sata drives on raid or use 1 ide drive and 1 sata. 
i would like to here if anybody has had any success with this configuration and if so how? 
thanks.
