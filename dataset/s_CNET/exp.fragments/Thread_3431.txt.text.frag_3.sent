i have a t5026 and my dvd drive stopped workin completely. 
i called emachines and they also told me to reformat my drive. 
but i didnt cuz i know dat had nothing to do with it and they gave me a new drive and it works. 
maybe the drive in the t6212 is the same one found in the t5026 made by toshiba/samsung storage corp? 
if it is then dat drive suks
