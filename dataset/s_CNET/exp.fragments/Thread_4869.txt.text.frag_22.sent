hello everyone, i have decided on the core i7. 
i found a great deal at microcenter for $199, so that was the decider. 
some of you who recommended things to me, i am not sure if some of them will be right for the core i7. if you can update your recommendations, i would appreciate it. 
i will reread as well. 
i now need to pick a motherboard for the i7, memory, sound card etc. i will update in a few. 
if you have any recommendations, please don't hesitate to tell. 
i am trying to make my decision by tonight or tomorrow morning the latest. 
here is a link to my final build thanks again. 
i will update again.
