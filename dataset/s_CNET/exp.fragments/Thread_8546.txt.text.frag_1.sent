just got cable internet installed a week ago, and now i can't use my pc labtop( my roomate's) to get on the net, but my mac is able to be online. 
a few days i ago i reset my router, because it had blocked my school website, but nothing else. 
i reset the router, and i was able to get on my school website, but i wasn't able to use my pc. my computer is attached to the modem, (don't have internal modem) the cable goes into the modem, then i have a cat 5 cable, that connects to the router, and then had another cat 5 cable connect to the pc. i don't have the any information on the router, other than its a netgear wireless router mr814v2. 
a friend of mine suggested i had bad cables, (wasn't a problem), type ipconfig in the cmd, but didn't do anything. 
please let me know if anyone has any suggestions. 
i have a g4 mac 10.2, 867 processor 768mem compaq presario labtop, xp homeedition, amd 4, proc 489, 496 memory
