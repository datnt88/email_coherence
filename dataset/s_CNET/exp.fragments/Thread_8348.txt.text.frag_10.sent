nickhlavaty: which model vm desktop do you own and how long have you owned it? 
i'd like to buy a new desktop myself; my basic needs are word processing; email; web surfing; and quicken. 
i'm not into gaming or creating videos. 
would a vm desktop be overkill for my basic needs? 
should i go with a dell with one of their new amd processors instead because of their low cost? 
feedback appreciated.
