of ddr2-533 ram as then you'll end up with 3gbs ram running at 533mhz and not dual channel. 
that's a very very poor choice...any way you look at it. 
for about $50...you can have 4gb ram (2 dimms @ 2gb each) running dual channel at 800mhz. 
that said ... here's my best and final recommendation ...4gb in 2 dimms for $45.99 list.cnet.remains

scripts threads maximum memory using pc2-4200 or pc2-5300 is 8192mb. 
maximum memory using pc2-6400 is 4096mb.although the memory can be installed one module at a time, the best performance comes from using matched pairs of modules. 
q: will my system recognize the maximum upgrade? 
a: possibly how much memory your windows os will recognize depends on which version of windows you are running. 
32-bit versions of windows will see (and utilize) only 3gb or 3.5gb. 
to utilize more memory, install a 64-bit version of your os. more information about os memory maximums can be found at . 
q: what memory goes into my computer, and will a faster speed be backward-compatible? a: ddr2 memory with support for ddr2 pc2-6400,ddr2 pc2-8500,ddr2 pc2-5300 speeds. 
q: how much memory can my computer handle? 
a: 8192mb. 
adding the maximum amount of memory will improve performance and help extend the useful life of your system as you run increasingly demanding software applications in the future. 
q: do i have to install matching pairs? 
a: yes. 
your system requires that you install memory in pairs. 
q: does my computer support dual-channel memory? 
a: yes. 
to benefit from the performance advantages offered by dual-channel systems, you should install memory in identical pairs. 
installing a kitted pair is the best way to ensure that your modules are identical, right down to the chip count. 
q: does my computer support ecc memory? 
a: no. your system does not support ecc. because ecc and non-ecc modules should not be mixed within a system, install the same type of modules that are already in your system.
