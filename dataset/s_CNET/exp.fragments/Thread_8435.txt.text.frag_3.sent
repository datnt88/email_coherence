i got the sony ereader. the best part was the ereader app for my pc. also the epub format gives you more flexibility and a better price point than the kindle does. 
why amazon wants you to pay more than half price for an ebook beats me. 
common amazon. 
if ebooks cost you less than half to make and they're are looked down to you so you cannot lend them or borrow some-one elses book like you can with a hard copy, then you should pay alot less! 
imho ebook readers are in general too small. 
so the one thing apple got right was the size of the ipad. 
i will get the asus transformer android tablet soon as the ereaders are too small and too slow and you cannot read technical pdf files very well. 
there are also lots of cheap android tablets that would most likely give you a better experience than an ereader device and way more flexibility. 
that being said, if you only read novels and one at a time, then a cheap ereader might suffice, else the colour tablets are way more flexible. 
then it just comes down to reading at night in bed - go android or reading in daylight go ereader, and the battery life.
