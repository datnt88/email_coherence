i guess if you want to be very picky it will be slower since you must transfer more bytes to obtain the same information. 
the best way to think of this is that it is just a different name for your computer. 
it does not have any affect at all on the way data is sent between machines or the way applications process the data. 
the key benefit to ipv6 is that there are more internet routable ip addresses. 
the key reason that not much has happened with ipv6 is that the vast majority of people do not even need the one ip address their isp gives them now. 
nat along with the ability of servers to share ip with dns tricks has kept ipv6 on the sidelines so far.
