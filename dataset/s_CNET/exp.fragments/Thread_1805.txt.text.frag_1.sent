i recently converted all family videos (dating back to the 50's) onto dvd. 
i have two copies of each. 
one kept at a relatives house. 
and the other in the safe at my house. 
i know dvds don't last forever, so how often should i re-burn them all? 
is there anything else i should do to make sure they are safe? 
should i rip them all to my hard drive as well, even if its going to take 50gb?
