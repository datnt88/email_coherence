&quot;i downloaded the original crysis singleplayer demo and turned the spec way down, this caused it to look horrible...which doesn't suprise me neither does it appeal to me. the reason i now ask this is because apparently they optimized crysis warhead to run far better on a wider range of pcs (im guessing lower spec). 
so what is your opinion do you think it will run at an acceptable level?&quot; 
i'm going to write no. you may have to look at &quot;the list&quot; and see how far up you can go on that list.
