hi! i just got an asus netbook as well, and i learned how truly important nice, compact software is in the smooth performance of netbooks. 
here's a list of the programs that have been working really well for me so far: -google chrome. 
it's a speedy, lightweight browser that works splendidly in netbooks. 
it doesn't have as many features as firefox, but that's a trade-off you'll have to make for faster performance. 
forget ie! this works much better. 
-thunderbird. 
this is a nice, bloat-free alternative to ms outlook. 
made by mozilla as well. 
-avg anti-virus. 
suggested to me by the guy who sold me my netbook. 
a lot of other websites say this is the best anti-virus software for the netbook's capacity. 
i've always been an avira user, so i am yet to see how this performs. 
-utorrent. 
a really small but effective torrent program. 
works great for my torrent downloads. 
i'm replacing vuze in my other laptop with this compact program soon. 
-foxit reader. 
for viewing pdfs.
