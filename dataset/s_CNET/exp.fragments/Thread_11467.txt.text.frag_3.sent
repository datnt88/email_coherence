on most newer sata drives, you connect the sata drive to the motherboard, then you can either plug in the sata drive using a standard power supply connector (i don't know the fancy name for it unfortunately) or with a &quot;legacy&quot; power connector (thin strip like the one you plugged into the motherboard with, only wider).
