if 1ghz is 1000mhz how come the basic computer i use is five years old and a cpu speed test give s result of 1973.2mhz. 
(nearly 2ghz?) i am looking to buy a new pc, (intel core2 duo processor e6550) but speeds only appear to be 2.33 ghz. 
thats hardly any faster after all these years. 
am i missing something? 
tia.
