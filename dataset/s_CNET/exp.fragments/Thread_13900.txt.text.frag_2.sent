give this approach a chance: that approach will work with any version of windows. 
if the information is available, it will help you to get it retrieved. 
i would then expect to get a new hard drive and use the recovery discs to return the pc to operating condition. 
i do not see a mention of what pc this is in other than windows xp pro but since there are recovery discs, i have to assume it is from a major manufacturer like dell, hp, gateway? 
there may be a way to do a repair install, if more info is provided.
