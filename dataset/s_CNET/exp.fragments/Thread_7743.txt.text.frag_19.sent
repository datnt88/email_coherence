but hey, everyone seems to be so (dare i say this?) &quot;big&quot; on small; so, why not go for a 1/2 inch screen? 
instead of carrying an mp3 player, tablet, cell phone, watch, pen, wallet, handkerchief, why not make it all one device? 
dick tracy, anyone? 
seriously. 
i don't even get the obsession with smaller. 
carrying something smaller is understandable, but, let's see, there's the i-pod/mp3 player, cell phone, and gadget after gadget. 
while i am considering a tablet/e-reader, i fear the small screen will make it hard to actually read; and, watch tv or a movie from it? 
on a 7-9 inch screen? 
really? 
i enjoy the luxury of my 17&quot; laptop, for the one reason, i can actually see it. 
but, that's just me. 
on another note, i have been considering a kindle fire. 
has amazon fixed their security issues? 
or, was that update just another worthless promise? 
thanks.
