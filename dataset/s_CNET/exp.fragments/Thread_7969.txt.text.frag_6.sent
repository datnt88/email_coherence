i tried turning of the dhcp, did a hard reboot of the router did a 'netsh int ip reset' and an 'ipconfig flushdns' on all three units and still...nada. 
if i type in the ip of the router in the browser, i can see and use the router config on both clients. 
i've tried both dynamic and pppoe(?). on the router web-based config window on internet status it says no connection which i expect since it's a dial-up (only thing available). 
on internet connection lan settings i've tried both 'automatically detect' and 'use a proxy server' both together and individually. 
in advanced proxy settings i used the ip of my host for the proxy address and ports 6588 for http and secure, 110 at ftp and 21 for socks. 
i left gopher blank.
