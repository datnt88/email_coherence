i have a small question for you. 
what kind of psu is in your e machine? is it the stock 300 watt or what? 
i have a t 2616 and it has a 300 watt supply. 
there must be some pci express cards that work with 300 watts as i am looking for a video card too. the pny looked great. 
it looked as if it was a great choice. 
sorry it didnt work for you.
