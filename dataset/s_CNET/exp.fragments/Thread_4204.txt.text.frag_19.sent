i find folk new to this struggle the first time as we must remove the heatsink+fan unit then flip open a latch and well the usual. 
sometimes the new to this owner forgets heatsink compound and ends up with a dead pc. -&gt; are you sure this is a good upgrade? 
we know that for games, it's not the cpu that matters.
