i can only guess you've not learned that there is no such server made today. 
that is, once in awhile you get the new person that thinks you can hang display, keyboard and mouse on some server and make it all work. 
they usually get upset there is nothing less than 2 times the cost of a pc. so here's the company and the products. 
so there you go. 
citrix on the server and hdx thin clients. 
done. 
i wonder still if you were so new you expected no client hardware.
