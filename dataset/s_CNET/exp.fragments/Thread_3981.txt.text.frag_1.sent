i am planning on building a pc for 3 reasons: cost effective, experience, fun! the computer should be able to handle hd video and multitasking, no gaming, maybe some video editing, and i want something the will not be obsolete in at least 7 years. 
here are links to components i have selected: case- cpu- motherboard- graphics card- power supply- heatsink- any suggestions? 
what kind of optical drive should i get? 
what can i do to save money? 
how much ram and hdd do i need? 
any compatibility issues? 
thanks for your time!
