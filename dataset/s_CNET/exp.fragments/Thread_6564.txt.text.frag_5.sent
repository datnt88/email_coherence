i have been using dvdcopy express (no longer supported) and used to get great burns. 
i've since re-formatted and may have deleted some files(???); the fact is i'm having the same problem. 
don't even &quot;see a disc&quot; message. 
but plays well in the original burniong pc. i am going to try another burner perhaps. 
please let me know if you have a solution. 
thanks.
