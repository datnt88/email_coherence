when i built my comp i wasn't sure what i would finish up with so i bought a q-tec 550w dual fan gold, which was on offer anyway. 
i now have an athlon 2600+ on an abit nf7 s board with a fx5200 8x 128mb ddr graphics card. 
i have 2 floppy drives, dvd rom and a dual dvd burner. 
two hitachi desk star hard drives 120gb and 160gb, i have a canon s530d printer with a built in card reader and i have a front panel with 4 card readers. 
iv put in 8 fans and it sounds like concord and runs like a dream with xp pro sp2.
