should be about half that price, so keep that in mind, it might be a better deal the reason i added the bit about the video card, if your card can't run the games you have in mind at the monitor's native resolution, it'll look awful (especially on a widescreen) because its an lcd so if the card can't handle 1680x1050, or 1920x1200, its more or less not worth having the pixels, yes, you can run lower resolutions, but it looks a lot worse (you loose a lot of clarity due to how lcds are designed and how they operate) a 22&quot; is probably a safer choice, as 1680x1050 is a friendlier resolution than 1920x1200 (and if you have to scale 1440x900 to it, it won't look as pixelated as it would if scaled on a 1920x1200 panel)
