well i'd have to agree that the cpu and graphics card temperatures are worth checking. 
i find speedfan an invaluable tool for this. 
cpu might have become unseated, fan failed or dust has clogged the vains. the latter caused me severe game lag before. 
similarly if the gpu fan is not working or clogged with dust. 
speedfan should be able to probe and report the temperature of each. 
assuming that's ok what else is running on the pc in terms of processes, av, adware etc. some of these programs can have a pretty heavy cpu load, maybe reschedule them to run at other times ? 
worth running tak manager and sorting by cpu idle and see what are the big cpu hitters. 
also how many processes are running and do you need them all. 
finally check the health of your hard drives. 
look in the system event log for any red errors regarding bad block/disks. is the device running at full speed ? 
if you really want to be sure i'd download and burn a copy of ultimate boot cd (google ubcd). 
it's a bootable cd which contains all the manufacturers test tools including all the hard drives. 
you can boot from the cd and run a full read test on the hard drive. 
if it passes then it's ok, but the windows disk checker alone is not always right imho. 
three full read scans with no erroros with ubcd is a pretty certain way of telling the disk is fine. 
speedfan can also interrogate the smart data from the disk (assuming it's enabled in the bios) to see if any thresholds have been exceeded and reports the general health. 
windows will throttle back ide performance if the disk is beginning to fail. 
this can have the symptoms of slowing everything down, for example how long it takes to boot. 
some of this is covered in more detail in my blog , as i have had similar experiences.
