my keyboard doesn't work. 
or, more accurately, my keyboard works only before windows loads (i.e. it works to get into the bios, it works to navigate in the bios, it works if i use a boot disk to load dos, etc). 
once windows xp loads, i have no keyboard functionality. 
i've gone into device mangaer several times to uninstall and re-install the drivers, both in safe mode and regular mode. 
no go. 
i've tried deleting the drivers and replacing them with &quot;fresh&quot; copies from the xp cd. no go. 
i've run windows update. 
no go. 
i've updated the drivers for my other hardware. 
no go. 
i've even tried to do a repair installation of xp with the cd. let me tell you, entering your product key when you have no keyboard really sucks. 
and it still didn't work afterwards. 
it's not the keyboard, because it works on other computers. 
it's not the port, because it works as long as windows isn't running. 
it's a ps/2 keyboard, and i haven't yet tried a usb keyboard, i'm looking for a friend who has one that i can borrow. 
any ideas from anyone? 
i've hit a wall. 
i don't know what else to try.
