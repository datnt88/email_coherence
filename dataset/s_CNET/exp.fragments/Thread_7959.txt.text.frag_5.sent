there are two buttons, menu and power, which doubles as down. 
i figured menu might double as up, but no, it does not. 
nor does a combination of both buttons create an up ... it's still down. 
by the time i figured that out, the intensity was at 66 percent. 
there has to be a way to reset the brightness to factory. 
i'm still looking. 
someone from samsung .. please weigh in. 
it's your company's reputation that's on the line.
