this is an instance where you may get more by selling some components seperately. 
if you've got a windows license, definitely install it since a functional pc is worth more than an assembled pc. the case, power supply, mobo, cpu, ram, video, dvd and ide 300gb should fetch $250 (with an os). 
anyone buying an inexpensive pc won't be interested in your higher-end components. 
so keeping the raptors in the pc won't add anything to its price but you should be able to sell the raptors seperately for $40-$50 each. 
likewise, the blu-ray reader is worth $50 seperately. the monitor should fetch $225-$250.
