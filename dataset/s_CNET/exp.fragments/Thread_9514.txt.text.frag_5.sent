is cachemanxp.(google it, its a free download btw) it tells you how much ram your using, how much page filing your using, and tells your what process' are running and the amount of memory their using. 
also go to task manager, click processes, click user name, and close out any under owner, but not explorer.exe or taskmanager, this can free a lot of ram, i heard this as a gaming tip and is even printed in some of them to increase your amount of ram(free ram i mean) and it should give you, well on mine, over 10mb more ram. 
hope this helps konny
