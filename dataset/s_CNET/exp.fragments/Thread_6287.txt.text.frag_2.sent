is to go to drivers and downloads select model choose printer printer again now find your printer download and install the vista utilities and patches for your vista machine. 
you only need to do this for your vista machine. 
if i'm reading this correctly, your printer is hooked to the xp machine. 
also read the information on printer sharing and many other items that may apply, there are 2 pages, at our forum sticky . 
if you still cannot do all your functions, you may want to consider fixing your network first, like the forum sticky suggests. 
unsure if you'll need to use the vista patch on the xp machine, if any.
