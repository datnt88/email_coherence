i'm looking to pick up a netbook and i was wondering if anybody had any recommendations. 
i'm just looking for something i can get on the internet with, maybe watch some streaming videos and other light duty things and has a good touchpad. 
ive been recommended the asus netbooks, but when i look on amazon there are so many different ones with similar &quot;names&quot; but a few different numbers after them and the price difference is usually large. 
for instance: the asus eee pc 1018p-pu37-bk vrs the asus eee 1018p-bbk804. 
there is about a $150 difference between the two but i can quite figure out why.&lt;div&gt; can anybody help me find a good netbook. 
$350 give or take a little is about what id like to spend &lt;/div&gt;
