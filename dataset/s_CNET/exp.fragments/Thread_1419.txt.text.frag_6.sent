pc is now running fine. 
no damaged parts. 
i'm still not sure what i did wrong, but it booted up fine for the pc shop. 
since i've been going there for several years, they gave me a break on the diagnostic fee and said forget about it. 
i told them i would be back anyways in the near future to look at some upgrades for it. 
thank you to all of the quick suggestions. 
i tried several times to check and recheck the connections, but somehow i missed something. 
thanks again to all.
