can you ellaborate? 
are you saying that i have no options here. 
that even replacing the motherboard won't help me because the the restore disk won't work on a new motherboard? 
i'm lost on that one. 
i thought i would be ok if i just took the old processor and memory off of my old motherboard and put it on a new motherboard? 
my computer is working right now it just has problems and i want to replace the motherboard. 
i would like to use the 6150 chipset but it's not crucial. 
i have no problem using the stock motherboard that came in it. 
sounds as if you have fallen into this swamp yourself?
