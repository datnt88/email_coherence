put a raptor in there but i have three of the adaptec enclosures ....2 of the acs-100s and acs-200 ((?) the one for the 2.5&quot; hdds) and never had any problems with any of them. 
i use them primarily for extra image backups and data transfer between home and work pcs. 
key is they work reliably and with all my systems and handle hdds up to 1tb. 
many of the others don't work with hdds over 300 or 400gbs. 
at the time i got the notebook hdd...i had trouble finding any 2.5&quot; enclosure that handle 2.5 hdds over 80gbs. 
here's another enclosure that looks interesting...i have an external usb by bytecc also ... but this case looks interesting.
