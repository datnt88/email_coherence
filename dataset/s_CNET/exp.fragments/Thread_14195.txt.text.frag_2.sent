here i'm just copying files from a command line or sometimes explorer. 
what's with that button? 
also, i wonder if the drive's housing has an issue. 
some overheat or have other issues. 
try a better case. 
-&gt; in closing, fat32 is going to mess up. 
it doesn't have any fault tolerance but it's your only choice if you want a mac to write to it. 
just remember it's a timebomb of a filesystem. 
no fix is planned.
