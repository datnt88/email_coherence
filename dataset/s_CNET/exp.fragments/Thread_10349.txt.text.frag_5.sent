i believe your concern is well placed. 
i travelled out of the us to vancouver for 36 hours. 
careful to make few phone calls and text messages. 
unfortunately, my iphone was set to automatically check in to data network. 
at&t said i used 614mb of data during the 36hours and that i owe them $6140. 
they cut my data service off this morning. 
i have heard that there is a consumer protection law that allows a one time pass for unfamiliar use and excessive bills for wireless service. 
does anyone know of this? 
any other ideas would be helpful.
