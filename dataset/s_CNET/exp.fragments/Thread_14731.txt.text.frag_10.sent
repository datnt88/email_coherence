this is a perfect example of what a sudden power failure can do. 
i can never understand why more people do not invest in ups power supplies (although this would have not prevented your mom from unplugging it too). 
usp systems have become so inexpensive that every desktop computer should have them built-in. 
unfortunately, drive damage due to a power failure is just a matter of luck. it all depends on exactly what the computer is doing or not doing at the time or the failure. 
it the computer was idle, hibernating or in standby mode then there is a good chance that nothing bad will happen. 
but if the computer just happens to be doing something like performing a virus scan, downloading windows updates or installing new virus definitions at the exact time of the power outage then there is a high likelihood of a major catastrophe. 
usually, the damage is in the form of drive corruption and some data can be recovered with tools like getbackdata. 
in the end, if the data is really important to you, then you may need to send the drive out for recovery which is not going to be cheap.
