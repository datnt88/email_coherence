obviously i have no idea i guess. 
my aircard is a verizon wireless usb internet card. 
which means it is basically a cell phone that dials into the verizon network and then connects to the internet. 
i have found a wifi max that says it connects to the usb port and acts as a wifi hub without the need for a router... which is what i was hoping the cnet cntcua-854 wireless usb 802.11-g ubs dongle was going to do. 
but maybe not....
