i use standby all the time - except for restarting once a week or so - i close the notebook cover and it goes in to standby. 
open it, and it is back on - quickly. . 
i used to use hibernate, but standby leaves the electronics warm - better than cooling down and heating up frequently. the hard drive is off (maybe good, maybe not so good.) and, it comes back to life very quickly. . 
i think that hibernate makes much more use of the harddrive, and i know that it takes much longer to re-start. . 
does anyone know of good reasons not to use standby regularly ?? .
