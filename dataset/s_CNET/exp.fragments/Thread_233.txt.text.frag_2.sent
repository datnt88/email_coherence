other than matched pairs of equal density dimms...certainly not 3@1gb and 1@512mbs. 
the system is probably adjusting the 1gb and 512mbs mismatch by using the 1gb as 512mbs. 
so the 2@1gb plus 2@512mbs is 3gbs. 
let us know what you find in the mb manual. 
vapcmd ps...if the system isn't stable 100%, you need to throttle back a little. 
otherwise you'll be writing to us sooner than later about the parts that no longer work.
