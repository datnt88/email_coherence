i'm unsure how one could not find such information. 
and to ask what is best means that you may not know either. 
for example one person things nonglare screens are best, the next loathes them because you lose clarity. 
it's been said that best may be to go shopping at places and see what fits your price and then, if you like the display and parts, buy it.
