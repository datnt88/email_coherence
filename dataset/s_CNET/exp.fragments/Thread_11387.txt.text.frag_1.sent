ok hi all. 
first time posting on the forum. 
i dont know much about computers but im here on behalf of my 16 yr old nephew who put together his own computer about 3 1/2 months ago... so my nephew came home from school today and noticed his computer would not turn on. 
after checking all the connections we decided to go into the computer looking for the problem. 
well we think we found it. 
where all the wires go into the mother board im guessing they look burnt/melted/ripped. i took so pictures so we can take a look at them. 
i have no clue what could have caused this and does anyone have any suggestions?
