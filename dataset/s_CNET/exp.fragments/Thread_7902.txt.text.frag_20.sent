yes, i would agree that upgrading to windows 7 64 bit would be better. 
windows 7 handles hardware, particularly ram better than xp. maybe invest in a high speed hard disk. 
western digital make the raptor which is a 10,000rpm sata ii drive. 
it's a favorite with gamers for high performance and reasonably priced. 
have fun and enjoy your upgrade. 
dazza.
