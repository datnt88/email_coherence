well that's an understatement. 
with each windows release i hope the backup and restore would be without issue but so far, without fail you find folk backing up but can't get the restore to work. 
here i have a few new windows 8 laptops and the factory restore fails. 
fortunately samsung didn't rely on microsoft.
