try additional file recovery pgms. 
until you seem familiar(or like) with the process. 
a boot sector error is something that can't be dismissed so easily. 
a damaged boot sector is far worse than a erased file or folder. 
remember, some pgms. 
offer to test and go through the process but don't really recover anything until you pay for the version. 
others may proceed and actually do the work but nag anyways even freeware.
