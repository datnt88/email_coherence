im not sure that my title is clear or not, so here is my question: i just moved to a new apartment, and after a quick wlan search on my laptop, i found out that i have a few open & free wireless lans in my neighborhood (yay! 
:d). 
so currently, i access internet on my laptop and cell phone using these networks. 
now, i want to kind of expand my home wireless network using the access point feature on one of these wireless routers (cisco-linksys wrt54g2 or cisco-linksys wrt54gl). 
here is how: i want to have internet on my belkin desktop skype phone. 
it has an ethernet port on it, and i am going to connect it to the router. 
i want to connect my western digital wd tv live to both internet and my laptop. 
again, it has an ethernet port on it, so i want to connect it to my router using a rj45 cable. 
moreover, by using the access point feature on the router i want to access internet, and i also want to stream video files from my laptop (which will be connected to router wirelessly as well). 
lastly, will i be able to use my printer from my laptop (it has wireless capability)? 
im pretty sure that i can do that anyway i am not so familiar with wireless routers and networking, so is it doable? 
id appreciate your help
