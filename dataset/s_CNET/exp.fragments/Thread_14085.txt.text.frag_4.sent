well i tried steps 1-3 already, although all xp says is that the device is working fine (via the device manager). 
i can't do step 4 because i'm not that familiar with electronics and the only other hard drive i own is my sister's (who i don't think would be too happy about my taking apart her hard drive...) hopefully i'll be able to find some way to fix it though
