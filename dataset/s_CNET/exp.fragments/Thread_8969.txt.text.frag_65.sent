since i've learned better over the years, i know that the only time i ever had to reformat was also a mistake. 
i had some roll back software that had an error in dating come leap year. 
except i didn't know that was it. 
i reformatted...twice. 
while it was half over the second time, i finally called the softare company for tech support and found out they had an advisory posted on their web site along with a fix. 
my only question was... since i'm on the updates etc email list, why wasn't this one sent out? 
it had already been posted a week. 
but the email came many days after my call. 
i don't use that software anymore. 
but thank goodness for them, it was an hp and i used the &quot;restore&quot; disk. 
all of my data was always intact afterward.
