most of your questions have to do with 2d display quality and performance, which hasn't been a real issue for computers since the mid to late 90's, so i wouldn't be too worried about it. 
however, i can understand your question and where its coming from. 
the 950 does use main system memory, however it doesn't use a huge piece of main system memory (i'm guessing 128m is probably the largest amount of memory it can have allocated to it (it doesn't have free reign, the bios allocates a block of ram to it)).
