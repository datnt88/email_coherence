i use four external drives and two-usb flash drives.. .. what i have done was to upgrade my system drive(c:) and use that for my first external hd useing a external enclosure kit.. .. i did purchase a 120gb maxtor for a system drive and then went to a 40gb..then an 80-gb.. .. since i find the hdd not that expensive it was createing externals that offered more pc experiance.. .. i format my external drive at a default allocation.. .. i use ntfs file system always.. i have a 1-gb hdd that's fat32.. .. i have wondered about the purchase of a hdd that's like.....300gb's... and wonder about running the defragmentor program.. since mine are: 80-gb.. 120gb.. 40gb.. 1gb.. ............................ i figure i'm getting faster results in defragmentor.. and i can isolate files/type..by useing just one drive.. .. maxtor diamondmax-120 gb is for dv-files..wmv..dv-avi files only/.. the 1 gb is a quantom hd i found..its an mp3 file for wmp-11/.. the 80 gb is a seagate barracuda..its holding major audio files..that are part of my video movies.. .. the 40 gb western digital wd400jb..is empty..and will also hold video files.. .. i have found no differance in accessing the files to a digital video authoring and editing software program..as compared to the system drive(c:).
