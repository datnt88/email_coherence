we know from experience and the cnet moderators that &quot;we only lose what we don't backup.&quot; as to the information on this dead tablet, if it's worth that much then you take the tablet to the grinder and get a new device/thing. 
if it's worth fixing, let acer fix it. 
hope this helps, bob ps. there is no assurance any thing/device will work without error. 
is this something new for you?
