i have a dell d610 running win xp2. the wireless card is a dell 1470. 
i pulled the card and installed in another d610 and have wireless internet on that machine.i then took the good card and installed it in the 1st d610. 
no wireless internet. 
i plugged in an ethernet cable to get internet. 
no problem. 
i reformatted the hard drive ,did a fresh install,checked the bios and upgraded to a06 and still no wireless. 
any thoughts on this problem?
