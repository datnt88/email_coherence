what would be better - use an old win98 machine, get one of those marketed 'kids computers&quot; or actually buy one of those &quot;$299&quot; bait and switch models? 
looking to spend the minimum for a system useable for a couple of years - under $500 total. 
i don't have the specs on the win98 right now, but it was a top of the line system in 1998(k5or6? 
amd chip), designed for scientific research/big number crunching, and has a monitor that works, network card, etc. my 4 year old twins are using computers at pre-school already and keep wanting to use my dell inspiron e1705 laptop - no way! 
they have an older brother in another household with a playstation - so they want to play games too (as does he when he visits). 
if it was just the little ones, i think i might be able to make my old windows 98 machine do, but i don't know if it could handle power rangers super legends (what they are begging for). 
advice?
