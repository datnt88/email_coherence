the link i supplied noted a change in a setting. 
about nas drives. 
i'm still searching for waldo, unicorn or the honest man here. 
for now i went back to a pc serving up content. 
but i didn't want a 100+ watt pc on 24x7 so i found a netbook that sips under 9 watts (i think closer to 7) and serves up content and more.
