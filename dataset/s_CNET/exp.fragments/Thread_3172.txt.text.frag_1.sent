i removed the option of broadcasting my ssid and now my wireless card is not working (was working before i removed it). 
i do have a wep key (128 bit). 
it does show the ssid on my laptop as a wireless option but has a red x through it and will not connect to it...i even went into the add option and updated all the info like what the ssid was and added in the wep key and hit ok but still won''t recognize it? 
can you help? 
thanks, michael
