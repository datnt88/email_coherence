you have dsl so your router 1 logs into the dsl via pppoe. 
i don't need that since i'm on cable. 
so adjust as you see fit. 
but i did have to make sure the lan on router one was not the same ip range as router two. 
i used 192.168.1.x for router 1 and 192.168.2.x for ... besides that, it's just the default settings. 
&quot;i am looking for the proper device to connect to one of the router ports&quot; that would be a wifi router or wap. 
today, the wifi router is the cheap solution.
