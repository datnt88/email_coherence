with new inkjet printers under 99 bucks, a refurb is unlikely. 
however a factory refurb (hp for example) for 1/2 price may be acceptable if you can accept that 100 dollar printers tend to last 2 years. 
-&gt; in the big printer market such as 1,000 buck lasers, factory refurbs are not a bad deal since again you can save 25 to 50 percent and again you must accept you may get a shorter lifespan. 
many will expect as new life and performance so those should never consider a refurb.
