if you are not intending to add a lot of extras, ie..high-end graphics, two or more hard drives, a few usb devices, high-end processor then a 400w should be the minimum. 
otherwise get a 500w. 
excess wattage won't bother the system. 
and very few power supplies actually get all that power to the motherboard and devices. 
these values are pretty much the rule of thumb for those of us who build computers. 
manufacturers will put in the lower wattage units to save money. 
hope this helps a bit. 
and life goes on... jack
