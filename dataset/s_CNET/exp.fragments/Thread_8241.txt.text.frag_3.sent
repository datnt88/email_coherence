bob thanks, regarding the psu, it is not a problem. 
i could replace it with new 450 - 650 watts. 
sorry, i forgot to tell my job. 
i am freelance graphic designer. 
so working in photoshop and illustrator (and dreamweaver for coding) is the main purpose. 
gaming is not at all there. 
sometime i edit videos (i am using ms expression encoder 3 for now). 
and i like watch movie using my system. 
i hope these information will help you to suggest me the right one. 
thanks, ram.
