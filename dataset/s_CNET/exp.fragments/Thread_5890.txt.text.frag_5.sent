this is not a common feature on home gateway products. 
the basic concept works like this. 
i boot my pc and i get a dhcp assigned address. 
if i try to ping anything on the internet i am blocked. 
if i try to browse the internet my browser is hijacked or redirected to the &quot;captive portal&quot; web page. 
this page may live on the router or may be a separate web server. 
at this point i need to login or click some usage agreement to get the portal to release the hijack. 
once i login, i can surf normally. 
here is a link to some linux based captive portals. 
i believe this router from sonicwall will do the job. 
they call the feature &quot;wireless guest services&quot;.
