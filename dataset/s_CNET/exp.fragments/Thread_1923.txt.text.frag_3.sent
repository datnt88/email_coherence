1. internal (usually pci) 2. external (usually usb and/or firewire) 3. pcmcia for a laptop, you certainly can not use pci card. the external usb adapter, mean one more thing to carry around. 
so pcmcia card have the advantage. 
now its up to you, which connection you want, and there are so many brand out there... d-link, linksys, netgear, belkin, motorola, 3com and many other.
