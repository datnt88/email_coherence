i own a maxtor onetouch iii mini edition, and have all of the software. 
whoever had the brilliant idea of putting the unlocking software on the locking device should be shot. 
kinda like buying a safe with the keys inside. 
anyway, the files are about 150mb, but the adobe reader folders that is included takes up about 100mb, but i don't know if the setup will work without them. 
i can offer to zip and email the 50mb (w/o adobe), but if you want the full file set, i'd have to send you a cd, but if you are willing to wait...
