hi, thanks for your reply, it looks like i have some problem with the wifi router. 
it is strange that: 1) i can connect to the network (local and internet) via wifi using my laptop 2) i can use other machines and connect to the internet and tothe local network wired 3) this specific machin can connect to the internet using other wifi network 4) my os is win xp and i reinstalled it 5) i also reset the router 6) still with this machine i can only brows my local network and cannot brows the internent via wifi anyway, i changed the connection technology for this machine and now i use the: &quot;powerline 200 adapter&quot; it is work great!
