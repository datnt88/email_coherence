by tablet do you mean only ios and android? 
if so, no. if you're including windows tablets, yes. 
i love my ipad, but it can't do everything, not to mention my it work. 
i was playing around with the samsung series 7 at the local microsoft store, and with it's 4gb of ram, ssd, and core i5, i can survive.
