good thing for me. 
so all i need to do is set it up as a slave and then i will not have any other files? 
one thing though. 
on my pc that got messed up i had accounts with password. 
someone could not see someones else accounts(like thier desktop, documents, folders) will i be able to see them after setting it up as a slave?
