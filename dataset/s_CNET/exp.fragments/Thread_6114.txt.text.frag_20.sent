lets face it bob, of course you must let the law tap the line if they request it. 
they are not monitoring all lines at all times. 
what is being said here is that the everyday guy is protected. 
if you are the mafia, or a online psyco, then this is some protection. 
most of us do not fall in this extreme catagory. 
most are like myself, being encrypted protects against others besides the law. 
its protects you when you go to a hotel and plug into that network. 
things like that. 
if you are being monitored by the police, tapping you internet line is the least of you worries and definatly not going to be the only thing they are listening in on. 
they would have tapped your cell, home phone, work, bank account,etc. 
this idea you have that this is going to get you caught it just out there. 
lets face it, these guys have a good product, good support, nothing out there that i have seen at even close the price. 
can you get over your negativity and agree that its a good device. 
again, what do you suggest?
