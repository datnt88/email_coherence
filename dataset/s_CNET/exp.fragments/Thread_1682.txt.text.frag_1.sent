i have a netgear 108mbps super g router, it has worked great with my laptop. 
i have just purchased a hp desktop dualcore amd 64x2 4600+, which runs xp media and want to connect to my wireless network. 
any suggestions if i should get a pci card or usb adapter? 
i have read reviews for netgear and they weren't too favorable. 
can i use another brand or will i suffer compatability problems
