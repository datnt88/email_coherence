i have been using a maxtor for about a year. 
the prices have continued to drop, and the units are very durable. 
i store video and pictures on the unit that are either being work on or being preped for more permanent storage. the unit has been outstanding. 
write speeds are reasonable, and extra storage is great. 
one important issue is stop the drive before you turn it off. 
easy to remember on a notebook, but you need to remember to do it also with a desktop.
