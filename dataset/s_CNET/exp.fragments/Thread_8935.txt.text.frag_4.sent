i'm thinking the same thing as vapcmd about the memory. 
i know that, with a mb with 4 dimm slots, when they're all populated, it drops to 333mhz or 400mhz at a 2t command rate. 
i don't know if that's the same case as with two slot boards or not, but it wouldn't surprise me. 
see if you can run 400 2t. if you can, run some benchmarks to see which performs better for your system.
