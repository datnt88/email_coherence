i've got an x700 pro and actually it came with software to oc the ram and the gpu seperately. 
not going to do that til it's lagging well behind what i need tos tart with but it should be intereting when i do need to. the slider sits right in the middle so depending on how far it'll let me go i've got a ton of room for either upping or dropping the speed on both compoments.
