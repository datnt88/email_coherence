this is getting very strange ..... the dvd drive will now play dvd movies , but will not read dvd-r discs that have been burned on a friends machine ( these dvd-r discs do play on other pcs ok though),nero info tool says it should play them.now when the dvd and my samsung sw-252 cd-rw are both connected the samsung will not work - there is an exclamation mark in device manager and it does not show in &quot;my computer&quot;.when it is connected on its own it is fine , but when both are connected the cd wont work.why 
wont both work when both connected?
