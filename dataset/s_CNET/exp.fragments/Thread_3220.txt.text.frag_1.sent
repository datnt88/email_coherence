i recently acquired a fairly old 40 gb hard drive which connects using a wide ribbon ide cable. 
i opened my dell computer, and found that it has no such thing. 
the only things using a ribbon of any kind are the cd/floppy drives, but those ribbons are less wide, and don't fit. the newer hard drive connects using some really thin blue cable and a power cord. is there some type of cable that will convert the thin blue cord to a wide ribbon ide cable?
