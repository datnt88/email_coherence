your sata/ide to usb adapter idea sounds interesting. 
i appreciate the info. 
i better understand your earlier comments about this issue. 
i checked and see that local microcenter has four different models. 
it has been nothing but a pain since that windows auto update back in february. 
wife lost her tv feature she used to record shows. 
system restore didn't even work. 
google &quot;remove ms office 2003&quot;, some time, and you'll see what i mean. 
nothing. 
can't remove the update, can't remove office, can't get old or new video drivers to work. 
i'll be glad when my wife gets all her necessary files saved to the new hdd. 
i'll see about buying one of these adapters try it out next weekend when i am off work. 
thanks, dan
