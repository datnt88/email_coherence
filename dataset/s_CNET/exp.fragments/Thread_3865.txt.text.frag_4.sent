no sp 3 does work with lexmark printers, i was stating that that would not be the cause of your issue. 
an sr number is something that the agent would give you at the end of your call so if you call back it can be looked at. 
i was wondering what troubleshooting they have done. the printer you have is one of lexmarks newest printers. 
have you tried updating the firmware which is located below.
