hi friend, my suggestion is better to buy google nexus 7 tablet...which is developed by asus hardware motherboard. 
nexus 7 is designed to go wherever you go - and now with up to 32gb of storage and the ability to connect to mobile data networks - nexus 7 can take you even further. 
nexus 7 can now operate on more than 200 gsm providers worldwide.
