you do need to install drivers from that. 
you didn't mention your os but let's assume it's windows. 
windows won't have all the needed drivers. 
a trip to &quot;device manager&quot; will probably show you what hardware has been found but not configured. 
here's where you do this from the cd. you start by installing the chipset drivers and then add the on board devices. 
the cd might have an autorun feature to help guide you.
