my personal experience is good. the only thing i'd have to say bad is i hang/freeze in my browser's e-mail. 
this didn't happen on the a6077c. 
but i asked here, and ppl don't seem to think it's the graphics card. 
but more the browser itself. 
i also asked if ppl thought the $300 savings over the a6077c was worth it. 
so far, ppl thought it was, because better graphics cards can be installed by yourself cheaper. 
you are getting a smidge less in the hard drive too on this one. 
i'm going to try a movie soon. 
i'll let you know how it is.
