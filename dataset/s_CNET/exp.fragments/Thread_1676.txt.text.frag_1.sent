let me say in advance, i thank you for any advice you may have for me. 
i currently have compaq sr1910nx that has an asus a8n-la (nagami2l) motherboard with 2 gb of ram. 
i am having trouble multitasking so i did a little research online. 
i have learned from multiple sites that the a8n-la motherboard will support an amd athlon 64x2 cpu. 
i would like to know if this is in fact true and if i would gain any noticeable difference in my computer with the swap. 
i am confident in my ability to swap the cpu's however i am concerned that i will need to alter the bios settings. 
can anyone point me in the right direction? 
again, thank you for your advice.
