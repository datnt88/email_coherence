i checked at the intel site and found his mb. as you mentioned it is a pci express slot on his mb. 
i did not go to the site and should have trusted the model # that was given. 
thank you for reminding me trust first until proven wrong, in this case the model # was correct. 
i would have given the same info if there was know model #, but there was. 
thank you very much: wendell h
