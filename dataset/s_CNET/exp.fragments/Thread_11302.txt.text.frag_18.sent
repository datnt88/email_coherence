i regularly burn dvds which is not easy ( possible ) with my ipad generation 2 and 3 ( i have both). 
i use my quad core laptop for that burning dvds and a few other things. 
i use my ipads and ipod touch for everything else. the apple products are much easier and enjoyable to use while the windows 7 computers are much more flexible. 
i am a retired electronic engineer and have used personal computers since they were first introduced. 
before that i used unix based main frames. 
i have used pcs with assembly language, dos, and windows. 
i enjoy using windows 7 and ios 5. i have tried some of the linux operating systems but prefer windows and ios.
