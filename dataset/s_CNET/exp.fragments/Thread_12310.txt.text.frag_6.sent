yes i checked and the firmware on my modem and router are up to date. 
i have another question since nothing i have done has worked. 
the problem is not the belkin router or the westell routers (i tried 3 of thes) but yet i have the same problems with all 4 routers, so all routers can't be bad. 
i did all the troubleshooting i know how to do including starting with no security and then working it in. 
i still get a bad connection 90% of the time. the times it works, i don't know why but trust me it doesn't last long. 
as stated previously, i am sometiems able to connect to an unsecured network in my complex. 
could there be interference in my apartment that i have no control over or is my card bad? 
how would i know if my card is bad? 
i have the belkin pre-n router and was going to get the pre-n card but of course my laptop won't take that card so i need a usb adapter. 
i am considering getting the netgear wg111u 108mpbs. 
do you think this will speed me up or is it worthless to give it a try? 
i am frustrated.
