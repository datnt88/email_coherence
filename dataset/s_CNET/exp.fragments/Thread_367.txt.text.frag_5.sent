hi willy, my current psu is an enermax 550w. 
i have tested everything like you and r proffit suggested. 
if taken down the the bar minimum of psu and motherboard, connected outside of case then i maybe get a second of power to the fans. 
but then nothing apart from a bad smell. 
i guess the next step is to try a differant power supply with the motherboard. 
what do you think?
