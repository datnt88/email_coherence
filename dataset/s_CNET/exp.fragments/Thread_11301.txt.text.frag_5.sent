i'm not sure what you are insinuating here, i certainly do not &quot;know more than (i) let on in this post.&quot; 
i did buy the dell mini 10v a couple of months ago, but i returned it a week later. 
i didn't care for its keyboard. 
the mini 10v had the atom n270 cpu with the 1024x576 screen. 
the aspire 751 has a slower atom z520 cpu that must drive a higher resolution 1366x768 display, which has nearly 50% more pixels. 
i think it's perfectly fair for me to ask whether there's a significant performance hit between these two machines.
