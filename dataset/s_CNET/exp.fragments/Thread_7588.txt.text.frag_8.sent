the biggest thing with hp computers is the extra software installed on them. 
i sell hp, compaq, sony, gateway ( and emachines) and i know a little about the inner workings of the hp prebuilts. 
first of all they come with alot extras you dont really need, software wise which is hard to wipe out of your system, also the support for hp's is really bad, hard to understand and even harder to get warranty service. 
if you do run into problems most computer repairmen(shops) will run away from you when you tell them its an hp. to be honest with you, and this is going to catch alot of flack from everyone else, i would purchase the emachines athlon 64bit system, they are immensely easier to work on, they are now owned by gateway and they are more properly priced. 
if you must go for a prebuilt system, go with the emachines t6524: brand name emachines manufacturer emachines model name t6524 processor type amd athlon 64 3500+ processor speed 2.2 ghz frontside bus 2000 mhz memory 1.0 gb maximum memory upgrade 4 gb memory speed pc3200 memory type ddr sdram hard drive capacity 200 gb video memory 128mb shared video hardware ati radeon xpress 200 audio hardware ac '97 6-channel audio modem standard 56k v.92 wi-fi capability included (wi-fi ready) no ethernet port yes infrared port no included integrated drives dvd+r dl/dvdrw; cd-rom integrated memory card reader yes number of firewire ports 2 number of parallel ports 1 number of ps/2 ports 2 number of s-video out ports 0 number of serial ports 0 number of usb 1.1 ports 0 number of usb 2.0 ports 7 number of vga video ports 1 peripherals included keyboard; mouse; speakers operating system windows xp media center edition 2005 software included yes warranty 1-year this would be a better deal in my e-pinions.
