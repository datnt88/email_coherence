dear sire or madam, i bought a cnet c56k data/fax internal modem. 
when i firstly tried to install it, it said that it's not compatible with windows xp(mine is windows xp home edition). 
then i followed the quick star guide page9 regarding how to set up modem for windows xp. but i couldn't find &quot;system properties&quot; or &quot;device manager&quot; so could you help me solve this problem and let me get online as soon as possible please? 
thank you so much for your help! 
star.
