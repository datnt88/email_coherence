i am using intel pro wireless on my dell inspirion 6000. 
after installing a netgear router wndr3300 (junk) i began getting a new pop up when trying to connect wireless. 
using intel pro wireless i choose my network like always and hit connect. 
i am now being asked for a device owner password. 
says it should be written on the router somewhere. 
nothing would work, found a 8 digit number inside the router that allowed me to get to the next step, which failed anyways. 
i read horrible reviews about this router so yesterday i installed a trendnet tew-633gr. 
i have uninstalled all netgear products on the laptop. 
uninstalled and reinstalled intel pro wireless from dell's site and i am still being asked for this device owner password. 
anyone know what im talking about?
