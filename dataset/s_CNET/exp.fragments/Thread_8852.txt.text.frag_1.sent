i have a sony vaio model pcg250. 
my network connection is fine. 
my wireless connection status says i am connected at 53.0mbps. 
but it says i have an invalid ip address. 
i am currently using a wireless router (dlink) and a wireless pc adapter (asante). 
i am connected but my internet explorer does not work. 
i went to command prompt to look at my ip configuration, but it says 0.0.0.0 i tried to manually input an ip address but my computer does not seem to accept it. 
i tried to release my ip and then renew (my friend showed me how) but i get an error message saying &quot;an error occurred while renewing interface wireless network connection 3: the system cannot find the file specified. 
please help!
