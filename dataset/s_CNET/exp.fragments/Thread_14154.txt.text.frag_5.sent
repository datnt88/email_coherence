if i remember correctly, you have to disable the 'jumperfree' mode and use the swithes on the motherboard to configure the cpu (this has been on the german asus support site a while back). 
apparently, the athlonxp series are a bit more picky about signal quality than the athlon tbird series. 
when using the dipswitches on the mobo, a different circuit, that should have better signal quality, is used. 
there has been a minor update of version '1.05', namely the '1.05.' (trailing dot!) to improve signal quality. 
this one has official athlonxp support. 
i can't confirm whether or not the 'dipswitch trick' will work. 
i hope it will because i'm expecting a 2400+ i bought on ebay. 
i won't be dissapointed if i have to run it at a lower busspeed, as long as it runs at a higher clockspeed than my (t)rusty old athlon tbird 1.2ghz.
