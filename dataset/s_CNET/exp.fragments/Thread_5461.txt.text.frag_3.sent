thanks for the reply, how about i move partition 3 past the unallocated so the unallocated is inbetween partition 2 and 3. then give the space to partition 2. are there any other programs i could use to do this? or is partition magic pretty reliable ? 
any further help and advise will be gratefully appreciated. 
thanks.
