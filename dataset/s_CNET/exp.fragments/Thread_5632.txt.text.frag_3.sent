its a dsl connection. 
all my lights on the modem are solid. 
my card is securely seated. 
i did not mention something before. 
after a while if i open up firefox i click on a link or type an address nothing will happen. 
sometimes after clicking a link several times it might go. 
people are telling me that this could be a problem with verizon not the motherboard. 
they say if it was the motherboard it would not work at all.
