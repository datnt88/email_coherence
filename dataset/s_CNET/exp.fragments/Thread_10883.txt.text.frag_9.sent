i went to the mac store today and the sales guy told me that i should base my decision on what i can afford . 
i decided i am going to get an imac for now and then in a year or two when i have more $$ i will invest in the mac pro.i am going to research and see if i can sell my g4 and get something for it. 
plus i just applied for a mac visa credit card and well see if i am approved.
