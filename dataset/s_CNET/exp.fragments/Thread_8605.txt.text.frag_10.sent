so if you have replaced the router multiple times it may be time to look at the pc side of things. 
since you indicated your pc works when plugged directly to the modem it implies your software and the ethernet port is good. the only thing different would be the wireless nic. 
since you can get a usb wireless nic for less than $10 it is a cheap thing to try. 
if you still have problems the last test would be to prove if it was the wireless signal or something else that is causing the problem. 
if you hardwire your pc to the router for a test it would eliminate the wireless. 
if you still have issue then i would be suspecting some software on your pc that is sending traffic your router does not like. 
could really be any application but torrents tend to be the ones that open lots of ports and may exceed open session capacities on some routers. 
if it works wired but not wireless and you have replaced both the router and the wireless nic you pretty much have proven it is some signal issue in your house. 
now the challenge will be to find the device causing the interference without paying a fortune for equipment that can locate radio signals.
