well the only laptops offered by apple are the macbook and macbook pro. 
looking at your requirements, a mac would be best. 
you havent yet told us what your price range is. 
please do that so it will be easier for us. 
now what i would recommend to you would be to max out your ram to as much as possible. 
thats what you are going to need most. the integrated graphic card should be alright for light photo editing. 
as far as i know, you dont need a powerful graphic card. 
and thats what sets the macbook and the pro apart mostly. 
your no 1 priority would be to get as much ram as possible. 
if they come out with bigger ram sticks then in the future upgrade to those. 
if you dont mind carrying an external hard drive with you, then it would be cheaper for you to buy one as they would be faster and cheaper and the chances for damage from drops would reduce. 
but if you would prefer the mobility of an internal hard drive then go for those. 
looking at your needs you need a big hard drive so get the biggest possible. the decision of which hard drive to get would be yours as you know how much music, videos etc you have and in future how much more you would need. 
currently the macbook can only have upto 2 gb of ram if you buy form apple. and the hard drive has a maximum size of 200 gb @ 4200 rpm. 
if you go for a smaller hdd then the speed goes to @5400 rpm. 
i would recommend going for a 160 gb hdd and storing all your stuff on a high speed external firewire or usb hdd. 
i hope i have helped you.
