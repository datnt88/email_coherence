hello all, i am trying to copy some files from an external hard drive to another drive. 
at first i have to wait for a while as it says &quot;preparing to copy...&quot; and then it copies very slowly. 
after copying a few(different number every time i try) files, it gives me the following message: &quot;cannot copy file: cannot read from the source file or disk.&quot; i have also received the following message a few times while trying to copy: &quot;cannot copy [filename]: the request could not be performed because of an i/o device error.&quot; 
i am receiving these errors when i either copy to an internal hard drive or external hard drive. 
i ran a check disk, and it came back with the following message &quot;windows was unable to complete the disk check.&quot; 
i am very confused as i can access the files on the external drive, but it runs slowly as i try to open or navigate through the external drive. 
also, i am confused, because it lets me copy some of the files, but then at some point gives me a error message. 
what can i do to copy files from the external hard drive? 
i hope you can help me as i have some very important files on the external drive, which i ofcourse didn't backup. 
also, please let me know if there are other options available to me such as recovery services or recovery programs if i cannot solve it on my own with your help. 
thank you in advance!!!
