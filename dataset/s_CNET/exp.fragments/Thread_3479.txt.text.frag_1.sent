how loud should a 120gb 7200 rpm hard drive be? 
i put mine in and it shakes the computer desk, although not too much. 
in all fairness it's a cheap computer desk from wal mart to begin with, but still it makes a humming sound, and every second it goes up for a bit and back down. 
imagine a car going by you in a race.
