i have a motherboard in a pc that has an extremely compact case, and it's getting very frustrating to get inside to the internals to adjust a pci card or install something new. 
last time i tried to install something, i had to remove the entire back end of the computer. 
my question is, if i move it to a more spacious enclosure, is there any catch or difficulty that i might encounter? 
i'm not trying to change the motherboard, just the case and add a second dvd drive.
