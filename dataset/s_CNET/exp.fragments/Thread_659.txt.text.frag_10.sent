o.k. looks like problem solved. 
has been running on dvi for few days without a problem. 
just updated driver on ati all-in-wonder 7500. 
first time it started failling againg after i fiddle with some settings. 
re-loaded driver (ati catalist) left it almost as is. 
using just one of the windows original screen saver (starflight)- works great.
