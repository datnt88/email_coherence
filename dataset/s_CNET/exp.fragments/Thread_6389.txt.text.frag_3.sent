i do agree that it is really convenient talking about the actual size. 
but i was disappointed to find out that you can not reuse it when you try to delete old files from the usb and replace it with another file, a message will pop up that says you can not store anymore because there is no enough space. 
when i checked the general preference the capacity showed used: 7.69 gb on disk (7,685,210,112 bytes), where in fact the only data stored left is (micro usb quick start up guide) only. 
unlike my other usb which is of course another brand, i can always delete old movie files and replace it with new ones. 
but i will appreciate if anyone can tell me if there is a way to reuse the drive. 
by the way i am using mac. 
thank you
