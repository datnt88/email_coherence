you need a load in order to test, otherwise the p/s unit will shutdown or simply not work. 
i assume when you say, &quot;does it have to be installed?&quot; that all the required wire harness were hooked-up and if so and it still did that either an improper connection or bad unit. 
i exclude any possible mtrb(system) problem besides the p/s, as if that's the reason you brought it the 1st place?
