i installed the new mb drivers first, when win98 asked for them as finding new hardware. 
i got all of them installed (no new hardware found on boot), then decided to update video drivers from cdrom. 
everything went fine, then advised i must reboot, so i did. then no video. 
it does post and continue, but no video at all, not even showing cmos etc. thanks for your help.
