hi i am a tad confused. 
i have a generic desktop pc running an asus h61-mx-usb3 board. 
to date i have run this wired to my router (a d-link dsl-2680) but as i now have a multitude of other (potentially) wireless devices, such as games players etc i wanted to re-rig to run wireless. 
i have two old redundant (generic) desktops both with asus boards and pci cards installed. 
i took one of the cards out (a belkin g) to use but the motherboard ports are different? 
no amount of google etc has indicated when they or if they changed. 
i realise having read elsewhere on cnet that i could use a usb adapter (but which one?) but the consensus seems to favour a card. 
i am a simple soul and your advice would be appreciated; greatly!
