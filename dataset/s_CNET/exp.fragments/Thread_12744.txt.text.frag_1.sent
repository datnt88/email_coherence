my hp laptop of 4 yrs died this last summer and at the time i was pretty sure that something on the motherboard or power supply had burned up because of the awful smell. 
i thought i would pull the hard drive out of it and use it for a backup drive. 
i went out to newegg and picked up a nexstar cx external enclosure and put the hard drive in it and connected it to my desktop via a usb cable and my desktop won't even recognize it - its like its not even hooked up. 
so then i tried hooking it up to another laptop i have and got the same results. 
is there anything in windows 7 that i need to do to get it to recognize it?? or is the hard drive just dead?? thanks
