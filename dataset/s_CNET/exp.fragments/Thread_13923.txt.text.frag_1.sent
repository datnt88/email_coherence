i have four hds from different computers: 15gig with win98 fat32, 80gig xphome ntfs, 80gig xppro ntfs, and 4gig win95 with fat32. is it possible to backup each drive all with their individual files, settings, etc into a separate partition of a large hd? my plan is to be able to choose to boot into the drive i want as if i had four separate computers. 
can this be done or is this a pipe dream? 
thanks for any response.
