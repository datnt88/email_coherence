do you run windows? 
then i have to dismiss firewire. 
why? 
people bring me too many corrupted file systems. 
however for the mac you'll get firewire. 
let me wrap this up in a nutshell. 
pc = usb 2.0, apple = firewire. 
about sata and esata. the only problem here is the os and drivers. 
if you can find good support to get it working this it can be exactly the same speed as the internals. 
i've seen some that never got it to work.
