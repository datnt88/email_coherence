what would you say it's the best buy? 
has anyone experience with the new intel-pentium d? i like to buy a new pc (tower) but i hesitate between intel pentium 4 or d. what is the difference between pentium and celeron? 
i have now an amd athlon 1300 (an upgrade after a pentium 2) with xp professional, but i suspect that the amd athlon isn't compatible with all the microsoft programmas or do i see this wrong? 
since this upgrade,2 years ago, my pc acts like a lunatic (i mean it!) after uncountable formatting i always manage to let the him work (properly more or less) for a month or two, then the troubles start all over again. 
no virusses but crossed &quot;things&quot;, keyboard that jumps between azerty and qwerty in the mids of a sentence, the pc blocks,the pc restarts on his own,he says the hard disk is full but indicates 10 giga of the 20 i have thats taken, blue pages, no more the possibilty of ctrl-alt-delete (he forgets this things!!?) and so on. 
now i have had it, i want another pc but wich one? the printer i have is new, screen and cd-rom + scanner dates of 1998. 
thanks
