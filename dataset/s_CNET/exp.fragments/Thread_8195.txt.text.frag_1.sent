this scanner is driving me nuts!! i am hooking it up to a relatives computer running win xp home. 
it worked perfectly when they had win 98se. 
i am getting an error message saying to unlock the scanner. 
there is no physical lock on the thing. 
i went to visioneer's website and they talk about this error message saying that the scanner can not calibrate and that is the default message the driver gives. 
they suggest updating the driver. 
i did that, and i still have the same message. 
i even tried to install it in my laptop and i received the same message. 
per their website the scanner is compatible with xp. i am at my wits end. 
since the scanner is over a year old there is no free support for it now per their site. 
has anyone experienced this and gotten anywhere? 
i would appreciate your help. 
thanks!!
