when you build it yourself, there are risks. 
new builders often do odd things like bolt the motherboard to the case without the standoffs and then take a grinder to the case to make the cards fit. 
even seasoned builders will often pick an undersized power supply and the machine will not boot or will develop problems shortly. 
are you really ready for all this? are you willing to replace a bum blown board or two? it happens... bob
