hi all i bought a new usb today, and when i tried at, my pc did recognize the device but the problem is that its icon isn't showing in my computer. 
i tried to solve it by changing the path name, but whenever i connect the usb, i can't access disk management because the pc get stuck and i get a not responding message. 
and then i have to restart it again. 
does anyone encounter a similar problem? 
thanks in advance.
