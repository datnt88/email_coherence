don't get hp. it's worse...trust me... today i had 2 bsods already (blue screen of death) and it takes not 6 or 10 but 15 or 20 mins on average to load up, 10 if i'm lucky... i don't even get the bars loading or any screen it's just blackout until it loads vista, and that means i can't even run safe mode. 
i've tried everything, including going back to old drivers, they said the new ones through windows update are not good, but it hasn't worked for me. 
i'm suggesting a toshiba, as uncomputerly as it may sound, they have a new system which is twice as fast than your average pc. (my boyfriends a technician, he basically sets new pc's up and running and he said for an average laptop it takes him 2 hours to set up but for some reason the way toshiba's made it's set up in an hour!) so consider that, and they're cheap, my mom bought one for 950 dollars with decent specs, 2gigs ram, dual core etc... and i'm getting myself one too, this is too much for me, the bsods are killing me) so if you still want a hp or any other computer for that matter make sure it's got mmore than 2gigs of ram ideally 4 is vista's soft spot!
