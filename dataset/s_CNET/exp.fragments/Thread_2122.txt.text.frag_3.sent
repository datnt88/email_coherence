ok. let me rephrase this question so i can get some useful answers: 1) what phrases/words to i search for to find more info on this subject? 
i searched but i couldn't find anything that applied to what i was trying to do. 
2) how do you get the best wireless data transfer speeds? 
i have no interest in a wired connection. 
if a router advertises that it's capable of transferring 450mps wirelessly, there must be a problem if i'm only getting 256kbps computer to computer and 4mbps from the internet to the computer. 
looking for the bottle neck, because i can obvioulsy trasfer satisfacty data from the router. 
if i could break the 1meg barrier, i'd be happy. 
also, i am using wired connections as well as wifi. 
just not to this particular computer. 
90% of the time there is only one computer on the wireless network. 
that should not slow my connect down to 256kbps, whether shared or not.
