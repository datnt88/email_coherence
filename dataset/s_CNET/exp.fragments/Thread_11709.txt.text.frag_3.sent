unconnect the printer from the system. 
now run a printer self-test(review manual) and check results. 
if no black output, its a printer problem. 
in most cases, inspect the innards for any possible massive leaks or clogs. 
i like to tear apart the printer and test connections and such, but in many cases inspect the printhead wire harness is fully seated and properly aligned. 
lexmark, tend to come apart or break for whatever reason. 
a cracked wire harness of the flat ribbon is very possible. 
as mentioned by robert, the cost of repair is too much and actual replacement is the best course of action to resolve problem(s).
