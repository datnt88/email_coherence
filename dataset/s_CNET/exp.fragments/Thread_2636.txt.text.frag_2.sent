i to am noticing a problem with my system. 
i just built it w/parts from newegg. 
amd phenom ii x4 925 asus m4a87td evo g.skill ddr3 1600 running 1333 palit geforce gtx 460 1024mb gddr5 sonic coolmaster 212 plus hdd seagate 1.5 tb i have tested my system and have found it to be unstable. 
it must be the graphics card. 
although, i can't confirm this i think we are having problems with the same palit cards. 
i have had system failures and blue error screens due to hardware failure. 
when watching a movie or playing a game with high graphics or low graphics i notice sound and video corruption. 
simultaneously, video slows and skips frames and sound makes a data dial up sound (like dialing up to get on a 56k connection). 
i can't describe the sound with words. the sound when playing a movie is like a game freezing and repeating. 
the same thing happens to frames in a movie, they skip and repeat and hang up until a process is released.
