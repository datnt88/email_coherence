yes, bob, this helps a great deal. 
i just got off the phone with d-link and since my router is discontinued and end-of-life there is no technical support available for my router since march 1, 2008. 
i would come out way cheaper just to purchase a brand new router and call it a day. 
it's not worth my stress level at his point. 
i did, however, get my money's worth since it was about 5 years old. 
tech support recommended that i upgrade to the wbr-1310 or the wbr-2310 router. 
i googled these units and both are considered pieces of crap and junk by a lot of the reviewers. 
i will have to steer clear of these units when shopping for my next d-link router. 
thanks for the advice and the link.
