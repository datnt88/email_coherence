you have a p-4 hyperthread, socket 775. 
as far as motherboards go, the prior poster listed new egg, good choice. 
good motherboards to look at, msi and or gigabyte in socket 775. 
use at least 1 gb of ram, preferably 2 or even 3 and you have a start to a very decent hook up. 
good luck and have fun!
