well, success!! i finally solved my printer problems with your help. 
i followed all the instructions you gave me, virus scan, scandisk check, windows and office update, downloaded a new driver, gave my printer a good clean, then installed a new cartridge and for the first time in months i did not get the error message ''trouble communicating with the printer'' it printed beautifully! 
thank you so much for your help, (its also worked wonders for my stomach which clenched in a tight knot every time i attempted to print something out) good work.
