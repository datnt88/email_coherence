i downloaded the inf file and when i ran it my system told me i didn't need it. 
i also downloaded a usb patch from the usb site and that didn't work. 
i followed the instructions to the t on visioneers web site and i still can not get the stupid thing to work. 
i think i am going to end up ripping the thing apart and just make sure there is nothing jammed in there. 
i appreciate your help on this.
