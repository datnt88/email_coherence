i have the same problem. 
i'm using a d-link router with an orinoco network card. 
i've tried disabling wep security, as well as mac filtering. 
i've also tried ipconfig /release and /renew. 
windows wireless client detects my network, with an excellent signal strength, but fails to connect to the network. 
i'm getting the same &quot;media disconnected&quot; message. 
help would be appreciated. 
thanks!
