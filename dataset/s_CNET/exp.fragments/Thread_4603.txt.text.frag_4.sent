well, i've had this happen, too, if you're referring to the computer coming out of sleep mode some time during the night. 
i assume that you're not talking about it actually turning itself on after being powered off, in that case it suggests sleepwalking *smile*. 
what i've done for the problem of my computer coming out of sleep mode when i didn't do anything to cause it, you've already done some of. 
when you disabled the &quot;wake on&quot; settings, that's a start. 
there are also wake-on settings associated with your network driver that are accessible via the device manager, and you also need to disable wakeup via usb devices (mouse and keyboard). 
you can find these settings, too, if you search for the them. 
they're also available in the device manager under &quot;mouse&quot; and &quot;keyboard&quot; when running it as admin, in the &quot;power management&quot; tab for those devices. 
once you've turned off the ability of the network, and keyboard and mouse to wake your computer from sleep, you'll be good. 
then, in order to wake your computer from sleep, you'll just need a quick press of the power button, and that's the only thing that will wake your computer. 
that has worked for me with several computers that seemed to like to wake up due to usb hid devices.
