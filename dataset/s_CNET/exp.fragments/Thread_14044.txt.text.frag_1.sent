i have an hp 7200 series all-in-one printer with usb and ethernet connections. 
i have 2 wireless laptops with access to the internet. 
i want to buy some kind of wireless print sharer that will allow me to print from both laptops. 
i do not need/want the printer itself to be hooked up to the company network. 
all i want to do is print wirelessly from 2 laptops. 
i guess i want to plug the ethernet connection on the printer to an ethernet connection on whatever wireless device i should by and thats all the physical connections i have to make. 
i then just want to be able to print wirelessly from both laptops. 
i have a wireless router that came with my laptop and couldn't make that work for this job. 
what kind of hardware do i need? 
regards, andy
