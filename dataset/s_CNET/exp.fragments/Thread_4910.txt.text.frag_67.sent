frank6760 gateway has released an updated bios for the schroeder town board: although this file just came out, the installer utility detects it as older than the intel bios. 
however, the update worked successfully and now no &quot;aa&quot; error! the operating system(s) did however want to reinstall all the hardware drivers during startup. 
thanks for everything frank6760!
