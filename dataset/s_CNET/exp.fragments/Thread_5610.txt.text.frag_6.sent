i have msi p35 and its good. 
no sli which is useless anyway, its also small sized so it will fit in any case. 
its bios system is also very good. 
i drop my screw driver on it and somehow it wasn't even scratched. 
anyway if you are looking for a good for the money cpu, get the core 2 duo e6550 you can overclock it well with a good cpu fan. 
if thats too expensive get the intel dual core series and you can upgrade later anyway. 
they are about 90$ and have decent performance. 
as for video card dont waste money on 8600gts get the 8800gt which is better than 8800gts and if overclocked properly can match the 8800gtx. 
also costs half the money.
