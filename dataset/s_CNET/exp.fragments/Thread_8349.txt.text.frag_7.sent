don't advertise or offer it now. 
i just checked ebay and a 1gb kit of 184pin, pc1066, ecc, was available for $279.95 with free shipping. 
&quot;dell dimension 8250 8200 1gb rdram rambus pc1066 32ns samsung ecc for all rambus systems, 400mhz/533mhz fsb&quot; a few years back i remember seeing a 4gb kit of 184 pin pc1066 rdram, ecc and the price was listed as $12,999.00 but it was 'out of stock'. 
at that prices...really wonder if it was ever in stock or if they ever sold any at that price. 
looks like pricing severely limited widespread use of rdram and ultimately gave rise to the design, manufacture and sale of ddr, ddr2, ddr3 and so on once the agreement between rambus and intel expired. 
cheers.
