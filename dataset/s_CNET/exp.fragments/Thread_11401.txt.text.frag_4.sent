i too have a dell and when the external hard drive is plugged in and i connect the ipod the hard drive locks up. 
my dell can still detect them both but the hard drive becomes useless because i cannot move any files that are related to the external hard drive around, and the point of having one was because i have to much music to store on the regular computer. 
i tried updating my computer by installing &quot;usb 2.0 driver version 2.7&quot; but when i restarted the computer the problem still existed. 
i would appreciate it greatly if anyone knows what to do.
