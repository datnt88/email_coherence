it's quite the little performer as i demo our company applications. 
it's running office 2003, visual studio, our apps and so much more. 
i can say i won't be upgrading its ram or anything else. 
our application is bluetooth centric so i did add the small bluetooth adapter. 
it's the same size as the logitech v450 nano mouse's adapter. 
there are zero performance issues to date. 
and the 6 cell version is hovering at 300 bucks so not a budget buster.
