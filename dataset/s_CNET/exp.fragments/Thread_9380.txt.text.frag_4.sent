after following twestsh &quot;kingston link&quot;, i see your problem. the 256mb install works only by itself and/or with added yet another 256mb ram stick. 
it can *not* work with a 64mb or 128mb in concert. 
follow ling and see ram map&quot; of how memory is installed. 
sorry ...but buy another 256mb ram?
