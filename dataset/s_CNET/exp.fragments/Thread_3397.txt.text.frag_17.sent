you might want to put some extra material inside the case to prevent it from shifting during transit. 
i've read where folks would simply set the case/system down too hard dislodging the hs fan causing the system to start but then shut down very quickly after wards. 
you'll want to remove that packaging/shipping material before starting/using the system. 
let us know how that works out.
