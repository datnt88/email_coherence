thank you for your reply. 
i don't know anyone who has a gateway computer, but i sure do know the name. 
i was hoping i didn't have to spend $1,100.00 and more on a computer, but it looks like i will have to. 
i will go to best buy here and talk to someone and i have someone who will go with me who is very knowledgeable about computers. 
this way they won't give me nonsense about the computer, especially because i am a woman. 
thanks so much again and enjoy your computer.
