hi, thanks for making the distinction about the cpu. 
i should have used the term &quot;console&quot; or &quot;just the computer without peripherals.&quot; 
i know about some quiet computers, e.g., dell &quot;hybrid.&quot; and &quot;endpcnoise&quot; makes quiet computers. 
and thanks for the info about the quiet cpu (dual-core). 
i'll add that to my list of specs.
