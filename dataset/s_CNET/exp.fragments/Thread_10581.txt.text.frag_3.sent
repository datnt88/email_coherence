let me first say that i am not as computer literate as i'd like to be, but i'm trying to learn. 
so forgive me if i ask stupid questions. 
-oh don't i wish burning to a cd was an option. 
it is not. the current computer i use does not have a cd burner. 
this is one reason i can't wait to upgrade. 
-as for a usb stick...these can be purchased inexpensively? 
-can music from an mp3 player be easily transfered on to another computer? 
i've never tried it in reverse. 
i have a sandisk 1gb mp3 player (which i love) that i also use microsd cards with so it's capacity is expanded. 
i'd say i have less then 3gb worth of music at this point that will need to be transferred. 
what do you think my best/easiest option would be? 
thanks!
