try connecting your usb devices: mouse and keyboard at the back of your computer (the usb port built in with the motherboard) not the usb ports that are extended and housed in you casing. 
if the usb port on the motherboard works, then that means the connection of the extension usb ports that are located on your casing may have been loose or disconnected. 
if it still doesn't work then it's either your mouse and keyboard is deffective or your motherboard needs replacement. 
to be able to take care of your pc components, you must understand them well.
