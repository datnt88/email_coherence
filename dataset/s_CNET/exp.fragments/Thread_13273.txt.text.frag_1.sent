i'm using a linksys wireless &quot;g&quot; 2.4ghz, model wrt54gs router along with my cox supplied webstar scientfic altanta modem. 
my wife & i both access our companie's vpn to work from home. 
also using our individual laptops. 
so at any one time we have 4 laptops in use. 
have no problems. 
i'm thinking of adding directv vod into the mix & am wondering if i should have any performance concerns prior to doing this.
