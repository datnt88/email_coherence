i have tried usb and it works good but sticks out the back quite a bit and i only have usb 1.1 so i prefer the pcmcia card for better speed. 
i prefer netgear and if that is the router you have i would match it but not necessary. 
i use a d-link router and a netgear pcmcia card and they work fine together. 
the d-link pcmcia card i got in my combo kit had driver issues and did not perform well for me. 
this is only my opinion so check around. 
good luck
