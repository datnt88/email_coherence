just bought an hp notebook with an a/b/g/n adapter and i am looking to add a wireless router to my network. 
i am considering the d-link dir-655 xtreme n gigabit router. 
i am wondering if it would be an issue that i live in a 3 story townhome with the networking equipment hub in a closet on the 3rd floor (max height of the home is 40 feet). 
the only other piece of equipment that would be wireless would be my wii (second floor) and my psp, my remianing two pc's have a wired connection. 
we use cable dsl btw. 
thanks for any help.
