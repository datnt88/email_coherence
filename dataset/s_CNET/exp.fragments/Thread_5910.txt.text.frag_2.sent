it's limited by the fcc in this country and being a tablet is a bit of a problem since you're never sure of orientation such as a laptop screen would be. 
figure that all tablets get a few feet less than a laptop in the same setting. 
at the office we have many tablets but not this one. 
frankly if i had a choice i'd get the ipad. 
once you have a few you'll know why.
