i have a five year old medeon computer with p4 2.2ghz, 250w power supply. 
the fan on the video card is making all kinds of noise and rather than replace the whole computer, i'd rather find a good replacement for the video card; however, i'm not find any replacements when i google it. 
does anyone know of where to find these older generation cards and maybe even an upgrade to the one i have.
