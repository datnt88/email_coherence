oh yes i have used limewire. 
my connection was bad before limewire though, but i will mention that it did get even worse afterwards, that is not to say limewire was a factor but it may have been. 
i will mention that at one point i used kazaa. 
it installed all types of junk and i immediately took it off. 
but i will admit limewire has become a bad habit of mine although not lately because i can't get online.
