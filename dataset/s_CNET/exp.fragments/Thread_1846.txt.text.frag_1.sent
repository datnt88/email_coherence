i am trying to decide whether or not to purchase an external hard drive and i am looking for some advice. 
which ones are the best? 
i would like something that is easily portable and that i can have access to whether i am in the office, car, beach, coffee shop, etc. how secure in a sense are these drives. 
for example if i drop it is data going to erase? 
my flash drive has been through hell and back and still works (drops, wash machines, step on, etc.) so i am looking for something like that. 
thanks in adavance.
