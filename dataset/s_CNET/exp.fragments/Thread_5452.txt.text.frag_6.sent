i did a clean windows install when i reformatted, don't have a chipset driver. 
i did check for available bios updates, but the only one available was for the pc series i have, but not for the model itself (it mentioned 'specific for...'. i've never had to reinstall those particular drivers before, so i might be missing something there. 
how would i go about finding this information?
