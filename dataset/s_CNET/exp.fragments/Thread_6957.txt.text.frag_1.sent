i just recently purchased myself an ssd, a 128 gb crucial m4 solid state drive to be used as my boot drive in my next computer. 
i found this guide here: along with the official firmware update from the site itself: but both of these are quite confusing. 
first of all, they don't mention how the ssd is plugged into the motherboard. 
do i just plug the ssd into my old motherboard and update first, before starting the build? 
or do i plug it into the new mobo and use external storage to supply the firmware? 
(like a usb stick or an iso file burned to a disc?) do i install windows 7 first, then once i arrive at the desktop i start up crucial's update tool? 
should i update the motherboard firmware before the ssd's? 
i haven't actually received the ssd yet, so i can't read the instruction manual. 
i would just like a general handle on how it will work before i get it. 
i knew it would require messing with the firmware going in, but i didn't realize it would be so complicated.
