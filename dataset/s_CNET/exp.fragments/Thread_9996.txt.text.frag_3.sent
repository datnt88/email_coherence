this is actually a manufacturer replacement for the the first computer i ever owned (that was an older pavilion series). 
that one kept crapping out so they finally replaced it with this, &amp; everything, including the ram, was installed by hp. i haven't upgraded it @ all. 
that aside, how do i fix this? 
what will this problem effect? 
can i just disable it &amp; forget about it? 
there is another device listed under storage controllers: microsoft iscsi initator &amp; it's working fine.
