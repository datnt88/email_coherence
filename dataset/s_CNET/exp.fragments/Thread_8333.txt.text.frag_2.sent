hi scott, the easiest solution would be to install a vpn/firewall at the nj site and allow users to vpn in. the vpn/firewall would serve as the vpn termination and once the clients sucessfully authenticate to it, have them get the files from the vista pc. (server) vista business and ultimate can handle 10 concurrent connections so you're okay there at least for now. 
i understand price is an issue as we're all hurting. 
if you can swing it, my preferance would be to use a sonicwall firewall as they can be easily set up and running with ipsec vpn access in no time. 
sonicwall has their own vpn client software so all you need is a downloaded vpn policy file from the firewall, import it and you're done! 
second choice would be the progear series vpn/firewall from netgear. 
they are cheaper, but not a solid as sonicwall. 
i've had a netgear vpn/firewall literally take a dive already. 
if i use sonicwall as an example, the tz190 can handle site-to-site vpn's as well as client-to-site vpn's. 
buy additional client vpn licenses as you go. and in either case, (sonicwall or netgear) you'll really only need 1 public ip. hope that helps...
