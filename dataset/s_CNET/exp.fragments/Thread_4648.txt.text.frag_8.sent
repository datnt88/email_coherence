hello: i have a powerbook with a firewire 800 port. 
i use it to connect an external hard drive. 
you may want to add an external drive in order to back up your videos. 
using the fastest possible connection for the external drive may gain you some speed. 
hard drives with firewire 800 connections are readily available.
