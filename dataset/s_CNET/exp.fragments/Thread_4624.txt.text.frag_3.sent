i work at a historical society and use a couple of portable usb-powered scanners (canon, xerox) with a laptop to do just as you say. 
either brand and others can be had for &lt;$100. 
by the way, scan black and white photos as full color, not greyscale, to get a good quality scan and be sure to save as tif files. 
you may want to scan at 600dpi as well to get the best image.
