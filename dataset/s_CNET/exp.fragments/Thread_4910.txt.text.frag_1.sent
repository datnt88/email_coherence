the gateway gm5478 (running windows vista home premium) looks like a great pc ( ) for a pretty good price. 
and i do really like mine, except for one serious issue that i've noticed other people have encountered as well. 
about a month after purchase, the fan in the power supply sped way up (which was really loud and made me practically jump out of my skin) and then the pc spontaneously rebooted. 
at first it only did it a few times. 
then it started doing it all the time. 
i've blogged about the experience here: . 
due to the fact that other people are saying the same thing about the issue, i'm thinking this is a design flaw. is anyone else seeing this problem? 
has anyone had any success in getting this issue resolved with gateway or best buy?
