i also found out today after talking to a sales rep at hp shopping.com 
about purchasing an hp desktop computer to replace my windows 95 machine that i'll also have to purchase a new printer because the hp deskjet 895cse inkjet printer which i have hooked up to the old computer is 9 years old but it's still working good. the guy at hp said my old printer wouldn't have the drivers to work with a vista machine. 
i hadn't even thought about having to buy a new printer. 
i've had my mind pretty much set on buying a dell vostro desktop to replace the old win 95 machine but my neighbor down the street told me to take a look at hp desktops. 
the hp desktop that the guy at hp configured for me was going to cost about $100.00 more than the desktop from dell. 
he had it with a quad core processor, a dedicated video care, 500gb hd, 3gb of ram, all much more than i would need. 
he was kind of a high pressure sales guy too, something i didn't like. 
he was quick to tell me that he worked on commission, that i had already asked him lots of questions and he wanted to know if i was ready to buy a computer today, i told him no and thanked him for his time. 
that in itself kind of turned me off. the rep at dell's small business division who i spoke to yesterday didn't act like that, he was much more professional. 
as for hp i think hp printers are great, i've owned 5 since 1999 but i have never owned an hp computer. 
if you had to choose, which would you choose? 
a computer from dell's small business division or one from hp shopping.com? 
thanks for your post on my quicken question.
