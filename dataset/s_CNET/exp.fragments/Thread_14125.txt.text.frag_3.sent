actually, i solved the problem by packing up the tower, with an eye toward sending it back to the builder for a refund first thing monday morning. the builder/seller, bless his heart, has been incredibly helpful, but the tower just wasn't working. 
the fact that the computer runs perfectly well, so long as i don't add that &quot;one last thing,&quot; made me consider the idea that this issue may not have anything to do with the psu or the video card, but something underlying. 
truly the number of items i use shouldn't take up more than a absolute maximum of 325w, or so i've been told. 
in any event, my work has reached a stage where i have no more time i can spend testing and trying things to make a tower that should have worked out of the box actually work. 
at this point, i am debating whether or not to build a box myself, since i still have the corsair (by the way, it turns out that the raidmax was actually 450w, not 500). 
i could return it, get a refund and look at buying a higher watt psu, but the cost of both sending back the tower and having a 15% &quot;restocking fee&quot; chunked out of the psu return is going to put a dent in what i can build at this point. 
i've suddenly gone from having between $650 and $700 to work with, to $550 to $600. 
not how i was planning to spend my little birthday windfall, let me tell you... anyway, i'm still looking to buy/create a tower that will put up with some fairly extensive video and graphics work--and which can be upgraded as time goes on. 
it doesn't have to be the fastest (though i do want it to be pretty :-d ); it just has to work when i turn it on and have the nerve to want to access the storage drive, run firefox, and watch a video at the same time.
