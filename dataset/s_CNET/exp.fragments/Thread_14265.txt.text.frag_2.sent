whether you wish to. 
it's personal preference, and for me, i do have an external for storing not just my mp3s, but photos taken, documents created and downloaded drivers/softwares, if i'm heading to a place where i won't need or can't use my laptop, i'll just bring the external hdd. 
as a backup also is not a bad idea.
