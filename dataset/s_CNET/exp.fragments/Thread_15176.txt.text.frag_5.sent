when i checked my video drivers on my system it showed that they were operating properly. 
i was able to ask my system to go to 256 colors but when i restarted my computer, it went back to 16 every time. 
after talking to our it server guy, i found our box of software and located the cd that had the original video drivers on it. 
i installed it (it kept asking if i wanted to keep my current files...they were newer...i said yes each time until the process was complete). 
after the install was complete it automatically restarted my computer and i was set up with 256 colors. the last thing i did was go back into my display and change my screen area to 800x600 pixels. 
hope this helps.
