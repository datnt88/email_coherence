i first used a sprint overdrive (see google.) later, after sprint backed out on a discount i swapped it for an evo 4g which costs about the same. 
i then used easytether to get internet access to some laptop and then ics to a wifi router. 
this is not an offer to write in detail how to set this up because if someone can't make it work with that much detail they won't be able to troubleshoot it when it doesn't work. 
i can say it worked great as a stand-in while we waited for our internet connection.
