almost any on board raid is a crap shot if the drives will transplant. 
in fact it rarely works making a fine business for those in the recovery business. 
given what's at stake, why didn't they make a backup? 
or were they lulled into believing by someone that raid 1 was a backup? 
and i see a mention of raid 0. with those i have yet to see but a few transplants over the years. 
folk try it and learn the bitter truth.
