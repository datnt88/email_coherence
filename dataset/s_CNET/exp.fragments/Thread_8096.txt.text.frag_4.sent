the diagnostic lights were for the memory: warning sound? 
does it match any of these: after 3 years, it would be a good idea to open the case and use compressed air to blow out the dust. 
i would do this in the garage. 
you will be surprised at how much will come out. 
while it is open i would reseat all memory, cables, cords and connectors. 
just use those instructions in the link below to open the case and reseat stuff.
