i'm planning on purchasing an asus rampage 2 extreme and an i7 975. the problem i have is regarding which ram to go for. 
although i will be overclocking eventually, this will be way off in the future and for now i just want to be able to plug in and get it running asap after purchase. 
i'm going for 6gb corsair ddr3 triple channel dominator ram 1600. the problem is that the board specs say that it can run 1600+ ram but has (oc) next to these figures. 
i presume this means overclocked. 
i don't want to have to mess around with any bios settings if possible and am hoping to just install the ram with minimal work (lazy, i know!) can i run 1600 mhz on the rampage 2 extreme without having to change bios settings, or would it be easier to go for 8 gb dual channel corsair 1333 mhz? 
thanks in advance for any help you can offer!
