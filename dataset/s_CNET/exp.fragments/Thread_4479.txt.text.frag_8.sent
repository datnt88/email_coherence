thanks for your advice; i already have the video card, bought from dell for a great price. 
i just started building around that...as far as the ram i understand what your saying but i dont plan on cranking up the ram, just tweaking it. 
forum users have been having great results with the crucial value and for $100 a stick thats a great deal, trying to keep build under $1500. 
im still thinking of scrapping the raptors like you said but still want the raid 0 for speed reasons.i 
changed the psu to a sp500 by antec...thanks for your input
