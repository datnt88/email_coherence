yes, i have the (v2) with the newest firmware...i purchased this model because it was on the xbox list. 
i never use my wireless, so i took the advice and disabled it. 
looks like i am getting better speeds (high 3000-low 4000 kbps). 
my home backs up to a school parking lot, maybe i did have some moochers. 
still curious on what routers are recommended. 
my router is about 4 years old.
