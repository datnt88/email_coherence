the x2 is just the dual core version of the athlon64. 
whether it is worth it is up to you. 
if you want the best performance in general, you will want to go for a dual core (if you have the dough - like he said, if you go x2 definitely spring for a good mobo and ram, itll be worth it then). 
however, if you want the very best gaming experience that today's tech has to offer, go with the athlon64 fx series. 
but i don't recommend that route, too expensive, and for a first time build, probably not worth it. the processor that i have my eye on is the athlon64 x2 3800, but thats just my opinion. 
it will, however kick butt for some time to come, especially if you aren't a hardcore gamer.
