hello rob. 
i recently bought two of the same pc that you have, and let me say i love it. 
just to answer the question of the video card, yes you can install in internal video card. 
i bought the 8800 gt for both of my systems ($279), and upgraded the power supply as well, but that was just for safe measure. 
i just tracked down a card that would work perfectly for you. 
since the onboard graphics are nvidia, i would stay with a nvidia card as well. 
here's the link for the card you might want to toss in a power supply as well. 
the card doesn't need one, buy a 400w supply would make your system more stable. 
and here's a link for the supply i would recommend. 
like i said, don't need the power supply, but it would definatly help. 
i hope this helps.
