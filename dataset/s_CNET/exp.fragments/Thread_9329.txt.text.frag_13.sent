try it first? 
i have it now. 
i am waiting for the computer. 
they sent everything out in a separate shipment--very strange. 
i have no idea when the mbp will be here. 
on a website as i was looking for the e-mail addys or how to contact the executives of apple, i came across a forum that was giving a 420 or $25 rebate on it. 
a guy on here or download.com 
kept trying to &quot;sell&quot; me parallels. 
he would send me to all these websites to see how awesome it was. 
i never saw that so i never felt good about getting a mac. 
this is my first mac. 
i have some microsoft or i should say windows programs i have to run for my work. 
they are not microsoft programs, they are 3rd party programs. 
i am hoping installing vista or the xp that came with my gateway that dies will work in the mbp. 
i have all the cds and the origional computer does not work anymore. 
either that or i will get vista. 
all of these add-ons is the reason i was wanting to upgrade the ram.
