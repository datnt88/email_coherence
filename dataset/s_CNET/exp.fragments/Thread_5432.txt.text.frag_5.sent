the computer itself is not for me. 
i'm buying it for a relative. 
their new job requires that they have enough memory to download all of the their company software, customer files etc. i have a refursbished hp computer myself. 
about 8 months strong now. 
i'm just a little wary of getting them one because this is for a job and not just regular activity. 
p.s. my handle was made years ago when i didn't know better.
