just find a case that will support the drive you want. 
my preference is seagate because of their pmr technology. 
perpendicular magnetic recording takes up less space on the platter making data access faster. 
i have at least 8 drives between my pcs, and my nas and they are all seagate pmr. 
i can tell you this, for a fact, they are faster than standard lmr drives.
