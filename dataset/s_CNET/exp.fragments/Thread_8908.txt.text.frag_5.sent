i use clonezilla to backup the entire image to a file on my usb external ntfs formatted hard drive. 
and it's free. 
sorry if i don't write a tutorial but it's a little easy to use. 
i also use gparted as well as easybcd for other minor duties. 
and those are free and well discussed on the net. 
hope my sharing helps you save a buck, bob
