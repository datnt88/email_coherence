when i shut down my pc, the operating system etc. turns off fine. 
however, the pwr and hdd leds as well as front of case illumination and internal cooling fans do not, this causes me to have to use the switch on the power supply at the back. 
this problem started happening all of a sudden without me changin any bios settings or settings in windows. 
since i have tried re-installing xp professional and take out ram, hardrive, graphics card, sound card etc. my system is running an amd 64 3200+ processor mounted on a gigabyte ga-k8nf-9 (k8 triton series) motherboard. the os is xp professional sp1 (was sp2 until re-install). 
i have tried updating the bios with no luck. 
any suggestions? 
jonathan.
