anyway i am having a problem with the computer power switch. 
i have an emachines w3080 and it's about two years old. 
lately the power switch seems to be getting stuck in the case a lot. 
when you push it to turn it on, it's not coming back out it stays there for some reason. 
not all the time but a lot. 
i was wondering if anyone else had this kind of problem and what they did to correct this issue? 
thank you.
