at the shop we swap cpus. 
but today we rarely do that since a few shops were taken to small claims over this. the owners will not accept the cpu was dead and went to small claims. 
so at the shop we rarely do more than both cpu and board anymore. 
it's a long sad story of consumers that ruined it for everyone else. 
bob ps. why not one dollar of compound?
