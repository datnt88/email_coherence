fans, even after cleaning can have stop/go intermit operation, replace it to be 100% sure. 
also, thr power supply fan can be the same way, so verify its working plus *all* fans. 
as for hds, you can add any hd vendors model. 
dell, has a help guide to &quot;upgrade&quot; adding a 2nd hd, but use that as if installing a new replacement hd. if the hd happens to be under warranty use that. 
you can leave the side cover off to help pin-point the noise source.
