the manual on the s27c230b says i can adjust the brightness, but once it goes down, there is no &quot;up&quot; button. 
i chatted with samsung support, and they told me to use the + and - buttons. 
umm, there are no + and - buttons. 
so i am told that once i turned the brightness down, there is no way to turn it back up. 
i did a reset to &quot;factory settings&quot; but the brightness didn't budge. 
what is the trick to turn the brightness back up?
