your subject line says your burner doesn't recognize media. 
in your post you say you can burn music cd's (but no data cd's). 
that seems a contradiction. 
and isn't the recognition part of the burning the same for burning a music cd or a data cd? 
so where in the turn of events does it differ. 
you can try to burn using a free program called cdburnerxp. 
if that doesn't work either, i'd replace the drive and try again. 
replacing is a rather easy job and the drives aren't expensive.
