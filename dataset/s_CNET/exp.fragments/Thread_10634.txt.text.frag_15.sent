did you ever figure out how to connect to wifi with the katalyst. 
we had a belkin g router and we had the same problem. 
we could call using wifi and the person we called could hear us, but we could not hear them. 
now we got a d-link dir-615 and we cannot even get connected. 
now a clue as to the problem. 
its very frustrating because samsung and t-mobile know nothing either, nor does their manual help.
