so i'm looking to purchase my first tablet and acknowledge up front that technology has never been my thing. 
however, i think i've narrowed down my decision to the google nexus 7 comming out this month. 
my questions are these: 1. does the tablet i purchase necessarily limit from where i can purchase ebooks and other media? 
my concern is that if i buy a particular tablet that i may be limited it's proprietary online store limiting either my selection or charging unfair rates for ebooks that might be offered elsewhere cheaper. 
2. if i am limited, how does google (for nexus 7) compare with amazon (for kindle fire). 
please explain if i'm not understanding issue properly. 
thanks!
