hi all, i recently purchased some new ram for my computer from staples, at the same time as i purchased the new computer that i bought. 
at staples they assured me that the ram was compatible with my computer. 
however, after installing the ram myself i have found that my computer is not recognizing that there is any ram. 
i was wondering if anyone could help me. 
i already had 4gb of ram installed, and i installed another 4gb of ram. 
i am using ubuntu x64 so it will recognize more ram, and i checked in my bios to make sure. 
only 4gb is showing up. the ram is pushed in &quot;all the way&quot;, and i know that my ram port is working. 
my computer is a hp pavilion g6-2235. the ram that i purchased has the information below. 
i am somewhat of a beginner and do not know what all of the data below is for, but if you can make sense of it then let me know. 
l/4g-ddr3-1066 sodim 4gb pc8500 ddr3 1066 mhz 9857462 i read online doing bios updates maybe, but i don't know how to do a bios update (or how it would be useful). 
let me know if any of you can help me! 
thanks
