i may need to replace a cooling fan on my computer but i have no clue what type of fan i need to get. 
i know it is the processor fan and i got the part number off the fan but i can not seem to find that same fan. 
i am not at all a computer wiz, but i am learning. 
how do you tell what type of fan fits your computer? 
i have a v2 premier pentium 4 proc. 
3.0ghz an810[e] motherboard the cooling fan is: foxconn dc brushless fan model#pv702012m i hope i have given all the important info not sure what else to give. 
thank you everyone for your time
