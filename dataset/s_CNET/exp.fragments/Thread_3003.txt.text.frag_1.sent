guys, i want to try to build my own desktop. 
i am sick of ungrading my old computer. 
i am ready for the challenge of building my own, and save some money in the process. 
i want to be able to play world of warcraft, do wordprocessing, and internet. 
any suggestions on what i should do. 
want to spend no more than $750.
