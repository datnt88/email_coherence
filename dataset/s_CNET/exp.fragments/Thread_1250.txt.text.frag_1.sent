hi i have a very strange problem and cannot work out what is causing it. 
so i really need some help. 
we have a wifi network @ our school where 7 wifi access points are via cat5 cable connected to a 8 port switch and then to a wifi adsl modem. 
every now and then we loose all connections for no reason at all. 
3to4 times a week. 
all other times it works perfectly. 
each wifi ap has its own fixed ip addr and i have no problem connecting to the ap but the ap cannot ping the modem. 
nor can i ping the modem if i connect directly to the wifi modem. 
i have to reboot the adsl modem and all the wifi ap from the switch, turn of all ap's and wait for the modem to reboot. 
now i have to connect each cable one by one back into the switch and one by one turn the ap back on. 
then all is fine again. 
i have replaced the switch but no difference. 
please please help
