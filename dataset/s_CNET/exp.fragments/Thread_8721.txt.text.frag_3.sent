now you see why i am confused! 
i use the same burner w/out any problem when i burn music cd's. 
but when i want to burn to a dvd media, my software (no matter which one i try) says to insert media. 
by your reaction i'm getting that this is probably a user error? 
or could it be that the drive just needs replaced? 
i was hoping there was a missing driver or update.
