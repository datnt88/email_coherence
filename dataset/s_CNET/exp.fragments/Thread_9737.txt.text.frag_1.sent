hi, i have 2 (1 old, 1 new) computers (the old one running windows xp professional and the new one running windows xp professional sp2) that are sharing the same cable net connection through a linksys wrt54gc router. 
this configuration worked for a couple of years but now, only the new computer will connect to the internet. 
the old computer doesn't connect at all. 
i have already tried: 1) restarting the computer 2) powercycling the modem and router that didn't fix it. 
also, i notice that when i restart the old computer, in ipconfig, everything seems correct, but the internet connection doesn't work. 
here are the settings: connection-specific dns suffix: ok.shawcable.net 
ip address: 192.168.1.101 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 default gateway: 192.168.1.1 then, i enter the command ipconfig /release and i get this connection-specific dns suffix: ip address: 0.0.0.0 subnet mask: 0.0.0.0 default gateway: then, i enter ipconfig /renew and i get this error: an error ocurred when renewing interface local area connection : unable to contact your dhcp server. 
request has timed out. 
then, i enter the command ipconfig again and i see this configuration: connection-specific dns suffix: autoconfiguration ip address: 169.254.78.32 subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 default gateway: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- i just think its weird how one computer can connect to the net and one cant. 
thanks in advance
