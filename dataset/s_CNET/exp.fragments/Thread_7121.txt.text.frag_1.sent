i am running vm fusion on my imac for a windows only share trading software program. 
i have inserted a data cd for updating some trading data but none of the 4 listed drives recognise the cd. the same cd's however are recognised on my macbook pro ok in the windows emulator. 
do i need to update the cd drivers on my imac? is there a free driver update, seems like most require payment?
