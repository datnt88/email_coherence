there have been a leak or two flying around but they all seem to concentrate on the machines ability with windows. 
there was a mention of os x not suffering but no details. 
i think the g5 has a little left in it, witness the quad version which seemed to have come from left field, but i'm not sure that ibm will concentrate too much on further development of the g5 or it's production. 
i'm sure there will be further development but not enough to handle a complete product range. 
maybe just the high end pm's until intel revs up the development of a consumer model high end 64 bit processor. 
i note that there was no mention, that i saw, of the new yonah processor from intel. 
i guess we will all find out what's going on, next week. 
should be interesting.
