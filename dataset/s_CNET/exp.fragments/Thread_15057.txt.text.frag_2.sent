this thread was started so people would have an idea of what to look forward to with vendor built systems vs home built which have much more control over. 
i don't know much about pciexpress so can't comment much about it yet as i'm still reading and learning more about it myself. the initial cost for home built will probably be more than a vendor built 'off-the-shelf' type system, but i personally believe they are less troublesome and replacement parts are a snap if you need to go that route later for upgrading. 
you even have choices of going with retail versions or oem versions to save cost since all that you're out of is a manual (included on the disks instead of paper type) and a fancy box you have to toss out. 
you also normally don't get cables and screws to mount harddrives and/or cdroms so those have to be purchased separately. 
most vendors who you order parts from can also supply a new windows installation disk as well.
