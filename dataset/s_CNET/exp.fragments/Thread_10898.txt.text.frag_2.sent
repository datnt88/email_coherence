im not quite sure this would work, but with my hdd [just a normal sata hdd] i go into cmd type convert [drive letter]:/fs:ntfs then if it says convert cannot gain exclusive access to the drive_letter:, so it cannot convert it now. 
would you like to schedule it to be converted the next time the system restarts (y/n)? 
press y then restart your computer and then it should be done. 
may go through a screen before the welcome screen
