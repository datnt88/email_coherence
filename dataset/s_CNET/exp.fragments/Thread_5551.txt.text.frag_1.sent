i'm looking into setting up a system for a customer that wants to boot from an external drive and have no internal drive. 
this is the control computer for a device that will be used in several locations. 
they want to isolate the use of each disk drive to a specific location for security purposes. 
i'm using a dell optiplex gx270. the system has usp 2.0 ports, but i'd consider ieee 1394. 
has anyone tried this? will the system recognize the external drive as the only drive and boot from it? 
are there any special considerations for the installation of winxp pro? 
thanks, dan .
