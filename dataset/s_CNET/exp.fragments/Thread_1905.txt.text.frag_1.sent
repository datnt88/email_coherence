hi, it's me again. 
i have chosen what to update with but am not going to order it until i get a second opinion. 
i really need help here, i need to get a new hard drive. 
this one and my comp in general just keep crashing and i know it's the drive. 
maxtor maxline plus ii 250gb 3.5&quot; serial ata150 hard drive - oem ram- here's another question. 
if i could buy either on ebay, which one should i buy? the only reason i would do this is so that i can buy more ram or more hard drive space for my 200 dollars worth. i need some opinions here! 
questions: 1. how do i install the new hard drive and do i need to buy a cable for it? 
if so, which kind? 2. circled in black in the picture below (go to that url) are these green things. 
are they used to install the hard drive? 
3.circled in red is my existing hard drive. 
how do i take it out?
