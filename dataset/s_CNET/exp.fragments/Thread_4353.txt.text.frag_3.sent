hi bob, thanks for the advise. 
i have tried replacing the power supply box but now the pc just wouldn't boot up. the hdd led light just kept on flashing but nothing happened. 
so i hooked back the old power supply box and back to my old problem (cmos checksum error). 
i have also did an &quot;eye-ball&quot; check on the caps like you said, all seems ok. no bulgging or leaking caps. 
any suggestions with regards to the power box replacement? 
thanks sk
