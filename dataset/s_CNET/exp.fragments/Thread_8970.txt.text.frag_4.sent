and most speakers do have fixed magnets. the volume at which you play the speaker isn't, itself, an issue but excessive vibration can damage just about anything. 
much will depend on just how close the speaker is to the crt and whether or not it's magnetically shielded. 
symptoms of damage from magnets are color and image distortion. 
you can easily see this by moving a smaller magnet around near the screen.
