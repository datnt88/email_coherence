open the case and find out what the p/s unit wattage is, it better be 350w or better. 
when a p/s goes, it does so w/o warning, it just does. 
replace it and install at least 400w+, 500w is becoming common and you can find a cheap one, but look for a namebrand like enermax or antec and pay the $$$. 
even if see some led on that suggests only that voltage is present, all voltages at stable and required levels are needed, don't fuss, just replace. 
it's good insurance too even if not the problem and allows room to grow on. 
if a bad mtrbd., check for damaged capacitors or obivious damage, inspect closely. 
find some, replace if not, reseat componets, etc. to try a reboot. 
mimimize the system to basic componets and try again. 
keep notes if need be, but if nothing seems to work, consider the p/s went bad and then took out the mtrbd. 
in the process. 
yeah, not good news, but beware, replacing one and not the other may cause the new componet(s) to fail too. 
i would change the p/s and have a basic system and start anew, add componets and expand system until finished. 
don't rush the process don't take anything for granted, otherwise pay someone to fix it. 
good luck -----willy
