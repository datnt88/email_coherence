i have 1680x1050 on my 15&quot; laptop. 
i find it to be a good compromise in size. 
i don't want too high a resolution because i'm afraid everything will be too small and lower resolution means i can't fit as much on the screen. 
unfortunately newer laptops don't seem to offer this resolution anymore.
