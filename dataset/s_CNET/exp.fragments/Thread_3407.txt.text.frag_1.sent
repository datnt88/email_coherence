i am looking to buy a new computer and i am wondering what are the best desktop vendors out there? 
i currently own a computer from cyberpowerinc (3 years old) which has been a great computer overall but their customer service sucks. 
still, i have still been unable to beat their prices. 
keep in mind, i am not looking to buy a computer that includes windows or a monitor (since some vendors make you purchase windows). 
i am looking in the $500-$600 range. 
as a side question, is it worth it to get a amd 64bit processor now? 
also, any recommendations on the best value brands for motherboards, harddrives, dvd burners, ect. 
are welcome. 
thank you.
