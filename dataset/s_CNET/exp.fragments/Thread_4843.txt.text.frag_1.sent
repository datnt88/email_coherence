we had a home network set up for us about 1 1/2 years ago. 
we mostly just use it to share the dsl internet connection as well as access a printer from one of our computers. 
i am having difficulty accessing the internet and believe that i have isolated thhe problem to a router that has gone bad (i.e., if i bypass the router the internet works fine). 
so, i will be buying a new router. 
question is . . . 
can i just buy the same one and plug everything into the new one the same as the old one? 
or do i need to find someone to re-set up the network again. 
(the last guy went out of business and i don't have another computer guy yet.) many thanks in advance for your advice.
