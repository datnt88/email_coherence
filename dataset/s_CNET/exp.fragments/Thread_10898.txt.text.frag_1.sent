hi i wanted to know what the best way to reformat a lacie hd from a mac format to a windows vista format is? 
i have the lacie big disk 500gb with firewire and usb. 
i'm using a format program on my mac thats making the lacie into a ms-dos file system. 
will this work or do i need to try something new? 
thank you for your help.
