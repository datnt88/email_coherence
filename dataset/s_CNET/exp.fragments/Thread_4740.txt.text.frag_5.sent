my apologies for the late response. 
i also bought a 600w psu, which works perfectly fine. 
i only have one power connector from the psu to the card, though. 
if what bob b says is true, that i need two, that could very likely be the problem. 
i'd like to hear from more people first, though. 
also, sorry for being vague and not giving enough information. 
i'll get the hang of it eventually.
