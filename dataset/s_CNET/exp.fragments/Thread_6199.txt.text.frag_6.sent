that on my wife's ibm that typing ipconfig or ipconfig /all in the command window does not give the ip address for the wireless connection. 
that is because she uses the ibm utility rather than windows to configure the many connections she uses and can click on the one of choice for a specific session. 
if i let windows set up the address, ipconfig does work as you say. 
i just tried and verified this within the last few minutes. 
it was only a thought. 
i do believe it's correct that you cannot ping or access a device on another subnet without passing through such as a router. 
in my own home, i've found static addressing to give me fewer problems and aid in troubleshooting network problems.
