about an ip conflict and now you write it freezes. 
that's two different issues unless you meant something else. 
review and then consider changing the dhcp range in the router. 
now that i know .14 is conflicting, we can change the dhcp range to .100 to .200 -&gt; as you are running a modded dd-wrt i have to think this would be trivial for you. 
if not, supply a link to your modded dd-wrt's manual so i can find the config screen.
