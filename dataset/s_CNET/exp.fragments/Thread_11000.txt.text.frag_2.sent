play the clip from the camcorder to some hdtv. 
this sidesteps all the issues of playback on a netbook. 
and if you ask if it will play, it might but only you can tell by testing it. 
i know i could use a video converter (i use super) to make it into something playable but if we skip the netbook for playback we now have a cheap uploader.
