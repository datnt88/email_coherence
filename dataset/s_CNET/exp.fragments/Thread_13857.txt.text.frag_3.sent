i have the router set to hand out 10 ip addresses. 
the most computers i have hooked up at a time is 3 because we have only 3 cables. 
as for the problems our personel office is having, it could be that they don't have enough ip's set in the router they are coming off of. the computers they can't get to connect always gets acquiring network address. 
thanks i'll look into that for them. 
do you suggest anything else it could be.
