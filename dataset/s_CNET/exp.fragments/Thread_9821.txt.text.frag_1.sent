i'd like to learn more about voip. is there any articles to recommend for reading? 
and is application like skype, pc telephone also considered as voip? 
and i came across an advertisement of d-link dvg-g1402s wireless router with embedded voip functionality. 
does this router provide the same functionality of a traditional router (that is to provide internet connection to the pc) and at the same time, you can connect a analogue phone and fax machine to it if a voip service is engaged? 
thank you.
