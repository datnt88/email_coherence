hi there i have just put new ram in my hp pavilion t620a, it had 266 ddr sdram at 226mhz, in the second slot i put in 1gb ddr sdramat 400mhz. 
is this ok? when it boots it is fine, it recongises both ram chip when i open the setup menu, but when i got to boot the nothing happens. the hp screen will show up, then it will go blank, then my screen shows no signal then it repeat the process. 
so im thinking my harddrive is not booting? 
its was fine up intill then... please help, i am sort of teaching myself as i go... yea might not be the best way to go... thanks
