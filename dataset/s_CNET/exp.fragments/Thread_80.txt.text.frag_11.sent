to make a long story short, contact the supplier or vendor of the laptop. 
-or- have a friend in the business get the manuals for the product in question. the repair maunals have the specs and such, but prepare to pay. 
if you find some sams listing on just laptops, don't expect to match entirely the end product just a generalization at best or get lucky. 
in the longrun, you maybe making an &quot;interface&quot; adapter not just a wiring adapter for a simple pin1-2 whcih should be part of the overall solution. 
put it this way, its a long way until completed and yes you'll need the specs. 
manual and of course understand the engineering involved as you've seen the basic output wasn't what you desired, you duplicating the laptop interface for a more hands-on connection. 
fyi - laptops are such a pita, i readily pass it on to the authorized centers if a quick fix can't be made. 
good luck -----willy 2-cents spent
