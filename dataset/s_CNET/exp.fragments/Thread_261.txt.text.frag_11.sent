the control panel of your video card (not the control panel of windows) should have a built-in option for stress testing your video card. 
since you use radeon instead of nvidia, i don't know if your video card's control panel has such an option, since i don't use radeon cards. 
you should check your monitor also to see if you have the latest driver for that. 
and you should check your connection by unplugging the monitor from the computer and then replugging it again.
