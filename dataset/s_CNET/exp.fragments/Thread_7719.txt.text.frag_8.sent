ok i'm getting somewhere now. 
it seems that powercom makes these upss. 
could be one of those cases where they produce a bunch of them and then relabeled them for some reason (maybe quality or age). the whole thing is crazy. 
it came in a philips box, was labeled power sentry, but was manufactured by powercom.
