i use windows xp. i have saved, sent to, and copied numerous files from my zip drive,and c drive to my flash drive. 
i have lots of space left on the flash, approximately 90%; however, when i attempt to copy or send addditional files to the flash i get a error message which does not let me send additional files to it. 
i.e.cannot recognize file&quot; i don't have this problems when copying files between other drives. 
please help.
