according to you: 1. you're missing your internet connection 2. it doesn't seem to be virus that caused 1 3. reinstalling restore internet connection 4. possibly not hardware (modem) problem my guess is it's a corrupted tcp/ip stack. 
it is possible that your antivirus might done a scan, removed a virus that is meddling with tcp/ip, but didn't repair the tcp/ip stack. 
most trained techies wouldn't know about this, as they're trained to answer from the lists of common problems they have. 
some programs exist to rebuild the tcp/ip stack. 
we can't know whether tcp/ip is the culprit though, since your problem has been solved.
