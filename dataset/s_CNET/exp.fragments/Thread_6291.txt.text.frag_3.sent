best case it could just be a loose connection, so unplug the video cable and plug it back in, making sure the screws are tightened. 
if that's it, it could be either your monitor has died or your video adapter has. 
if you can plug in another monitor, you can see if it's your video adapter. 
if the adapter is working, that narrows it down to the monitor. 
i have an acer monitor i bought a couple of years ago that has a light below the lower right corner. 
fwiw, when it's not receiving a signal the light is amber, when it is, it's blue. 
good luck.
