if it hangs, let it be. 
give it at least 10-15min. 
more and see what happens. 
-or- walk away and enjoy a drink of your choice. 
come back and check results., 
maybe it will finally error out and report what happens, but rebooting beforehand will only create yet another problem sooner or later. 
if you're running xp, check the log report for errors/status during that time. 
here's link for such info: it maybe time to replace the power supply(psu), hangs at such times and a reboot pretty much suggest you have a failing psu, no &quot;upphh&quot; during initial boot-up.
