i just found out the solution to my problem, or what is affecting my results. 
apparently, one side of my house is on a different power line than the other side, and the 2 outlets i'm trying to use together with the powerline adapters won't work together (after a long series of tests with my laptop). 
this is uber-strange, as it was working all over my house just a few months ago. is this possible to fix or are the powerline adapters basically useless now?
