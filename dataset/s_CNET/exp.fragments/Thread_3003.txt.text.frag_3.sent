do you need a complete system (complete computer box, keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor)? 
or do you already have a good monitor or speakers that you wish to add to a computer box that you will build? 
btw, congratulations on taking on this challenge. 
i find it is quite rewarding to build a new machine. 
i trust you will, also.
