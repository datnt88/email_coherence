i want to build a pc but i have no experience with hardware. 
i've watched tutorials on how to build a pc and done some research on hardware and this is the build i came up with. 
i'd appreciate some feedback before i spend $900. 
i want to be able to play games like skyrim on at least high settings with a ton of mods. 
this may not quite pull that off due to budget issues (or will it?). could you rate my build 1-10 for how well it should work for that? 
motherboard cpu gpu hdd ram dvd psu case os $861 + shipping. 
how does this look? 
am i missing anything (besides monitor/mouse/keyboard)?
