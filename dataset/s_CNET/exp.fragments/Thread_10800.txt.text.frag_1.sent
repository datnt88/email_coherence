acquired a cast off dell that was on a network somewhere. 
processor shows up as x386. 
doesn't have blazing speed. 
ram expressed as 250,000+ kb. 
runs win2000 for networks, service pack 4. has a bunch of adobe editing stuff installed. 
if i fill up the ram with as much as i can find do you think it will make a good backup?
