while you didn't share the message about the bios not installed, there is a common message like that but it is not a failure but informational. 
i often disable the message so the owner isn't confused by it. 
many don't know a new drive will have to be prepared for use. 
with xp we use the drive management tool noted in xp's start, help and support. 
this preperation is not optional.
