gskill probably would have worked but when a mb has been out as long as the 680i has and that memory, gskill, is not listed...best to stick with something listed as compatible. 
gskill is good ram in fact i have 4gb of the pc1066 in a gigabyte mb. re the mb...i'd recommend looking for something with a newer chipset. 
if i recall correctly at one time there were problems with the 680i and the q6600. 
maybe the 780i re the hdd...take a look at the wd6400aaks...640gb re the pcp psu....you'll like that !
