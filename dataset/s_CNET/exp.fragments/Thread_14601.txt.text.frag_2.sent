if your graphics card has a vga output and you have an adapter and the proper cables the hook into a tv you should be ok. if this is true what graphics card do you have. 
some older ones have vga output and won't be able to support that awesome 1080 p resolution. and also i think all tv's can support as a screen. 
don;t quote me on that because i might depend on your operating system and system specs, but your a computer programmer so i suspect that you have a pretty nice system.
