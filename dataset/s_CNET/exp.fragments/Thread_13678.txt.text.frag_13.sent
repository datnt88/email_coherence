esata has not reached the point i would consider this. 
with each machine you have to not only obtain the esata card and connectors but do battle with the os to install sata support. 
if you haven't installed windows 2000/xp onto a sata drive you may be in for a rude shock. 
-&gt; i also get the feeling you want to put a game that you want to run on various machines. 
even with the drive being portable the big problem is that with windows programs rarely move with the external drives. 
that is the owner installs an external drive, installs battlefield on it and then takes the drive to a friends house. 
bf won't run! let me be frank, honest and offer my best advice here. 
go get your usb 2.0 card and your usb 2.0 drive and let it work without you heading down a dark path to a blind alley. 
you will read those that will push esata but did they get it working on your windows 2000 machine?
