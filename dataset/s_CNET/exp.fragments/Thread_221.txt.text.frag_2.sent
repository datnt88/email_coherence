i have a scsi cd burner that did not like any disk produced by vertabim. 
couple that with a g3 that would not read any disk that was gold and a g4 that did not like reading disks with a white, printable, top. 
it's, apparently, something to do with the way that the laser light is reflected back. 
not all optical devices are created equal and yours may be just a little under spec. 
if there is an apple store close to you, or you know someone else with a macbook pro, take your machine and some of those black disks there and see if the other machines can read them. 
oh yes, apple did not do anything to make black bottomed disks unreadable.
