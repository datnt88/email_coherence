i have an industrial application (measurement instrument) which has a scsi-2 connector (hd-50 male) which is used to connect to an external scsi drive. 
since the external scsi drive we used is no longer available, i need to find either: (a) an external drive that has a scsi-2 interface (or one which i can adapt to), or (b) a scsi-2 to usb converter to allow the use of a usb drive or stick. 
for (a), i have not been able to find anything other than scsi drives which have vhdci connectors, which i'm told cannot be adapted to a 50-pin scsi-2 interface. 
is this correct? 
for (b), all i can find are adapters which treat scsi as the peripheral, not the host (i.e. the host is our instrument with the scsi interface, and the peripheral would be a usb device). 
any suggestions for either solution? 
no, we cannot re-design our product to use a different bus architecture (too costly, and the product is going eol shortly). 
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
