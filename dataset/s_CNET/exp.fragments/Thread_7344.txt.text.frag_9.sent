thanks every one for the all your helpful advice. 
the usb flash key is not my only backup. 
i do have cd rw and cd r backup. 
there could be something bob mentioned about the media that i backed up and with the music license that i backed up the write protection and copies. 
there is also a possibility what mikebliv said about window explorer doing a quick scan of what drives are available on the system making the usb drive blink. 
my usb flash key has 4gb it is a ready boost available. 
i do find using it convenient easier than a cd. i will now not leave the key plugged in the pc as a precaution. 
thanks hele
