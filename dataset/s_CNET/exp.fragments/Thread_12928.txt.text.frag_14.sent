hi,i'm not saying all the other responces are wrong,but i'll tell you experance i had.i took my computer in[12/02] once after fooling around with on and off for mo's and they sayed it was the motherboard or power supply.i 
brought it home and fixed it myself.it was the fan on the cpu.it was running but full of dust/durt.i had a can of air and blew it out plus everthing else.and its still running.way 
did it get so durty,i have a fireplace for heat.
