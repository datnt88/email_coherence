as though your system has integrated video. 
that means it uses some of your system ram (only 1gb) for video. 
so bottom line ....you've only got 1gb of system ram (too little in my opinion) and some of it perhaps up to 256mb is being used for video. 
my suggestion ... try adding system ram to bring your system up to a total of at least 2gb or budget permitting, 4gb. 
if you want more speed, then look at some of the video options offered....just keep in mind you system psu must provide enough power, watts and amps, for the video card you select. 
let us know how it turns out.
