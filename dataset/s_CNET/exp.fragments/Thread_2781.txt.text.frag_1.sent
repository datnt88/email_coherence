hi my computer is 3 years old and i am thinking of getting a new one but i am considering two options. 
i have some idea about what goes on inside the case and am pretty sure that i could break the comp down and build it back up. 
i have removed and reinseted my modem, my video card, my burner and i have installed a new hard drive and have dual booted my system (not anymore though, cause i have a new scanner and don't need win me for my scanner). 
i want to use back some parts from my old machine: 1. modem 2. hard drives (i have two of them) 3. i have a 32mx nivda card, and i think that its good for me. 
i think thats about it i want to get some new parts 1. upgrade from a 1.3 ghz to something faster (not sure what speed is best) 2. i have 2 x 64mb rd-ram. 
need new ram not sure what brand? 3. dvd/cd-burner so i think that its time for a new comp and was wondering which method is cheaper and why i should choose to buy or build my system.
