don't know much about mac addresses. 
i've determined not to do any secure browsing on my notebook, but i don't know how to determine its address. 
i see the numerical entry spaces to enter them, but how does one determine a notebook's mac address? 
again, thanks all. 
seems like wap security is a bit of a oxymoron.
