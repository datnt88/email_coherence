maybe this drive is not ready to use? 
all these posts and i can't find what this usb thing is. 
it could need preparing for use by deleting any partition on it, create a new partition then formatting it. 
you bring up a good point here. is this asking a lot of today's users? 
that is, should products arrive ready to be used?
