i have 2 harddrives. the one that is usefull is a 2gb harddrive that has win98 and a handful of other programs on it. 
dont ask me how they got all of that on a little hd. my problem is that the 20gb harddrive i got was formatted. 
i use the 2gb to boot the gateway system that the 20gb came in, and im trying to create a new operating system on the 20gb. 
i need to find new drivers so i can use the cdrom, and i need to find either win98 or xp to put on the 20gb after i get the new drivers installed. 
the problem at hand is the jumpers on the back of the hd's. the 2gb has 3 sets of prongs but no jumper. the 20gb has 4 sets of prongs with the jumper on the second set away from the ribbon. 
i want to know where the jumper needs to be so that the 2gb harddrive is the primary and the 20gb harddrive is the slave.
