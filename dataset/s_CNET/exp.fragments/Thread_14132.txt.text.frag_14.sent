while some may take offense at seperating discussions into specialised forums, this question is better fielded in the browser, pc applications or the os forum since it's unlikely to be caused by pc hardware. 
be sure to post the os version, browser version and printers so the responding forum doesn't have to ask for that in their first response. 
i will note that an ongoing issue with html is that there is no print control. 
that is, what you see on the browser may have little to do with the printed output (or even the print preview.) this can rattle people that are new to html, but you will find that such is under discussion at bob bob
