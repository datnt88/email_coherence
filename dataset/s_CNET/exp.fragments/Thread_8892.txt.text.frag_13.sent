ok don't buy a geforce4 mx or geforce mx 4000 while they have dual ramdacs (what you need for dual monitors) the ramdacs usually won't run 100% in tandem (i've tried it with a gf4 mx, and proven it, the issue is that demanding thigns, like video playback, won't run on both screens) another note if the card has dual ramdacs it'll do dual output also given the increasement in analog signal quality, dvi-i won't improve the image (about 3% improvement) and it limits you to 1600x1200 max (but i'm guessing this lcd isn't that big) i'd say just go with dual analog out a lot of video cards have issues metting true dvi-i spec (they don't send a strong enough signal for digital, as most people use them converted back to analog for dual monitor, as dvi monitors used to be so amazingly expensive it wasn't even funny) when dvi-i was new it was great but now, it's not much better it used to be better back when analog output quality wasn't up to snuff
