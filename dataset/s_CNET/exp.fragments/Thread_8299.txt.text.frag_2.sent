most likely all that noise is coming from the case fan i just build a sempron based system with the help from my cousin. the cpu fan is really quiet, so i'm assuming it is coming from the case. 
lets say it is the cpu fan or the case fan or both you do have the option of using watercooling devices this site has a good how to about purchasing and installing a watercooling device if that is not your cup of tea then i would get something in between an internal liquid fan. 
you might want to check the section about watercooling and check it out. 
i was thinking about doing it myself but i don't have the guts to do it myself.
