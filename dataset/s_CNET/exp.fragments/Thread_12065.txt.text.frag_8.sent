i read the link you sent. 
i can't change to the bridge mode beacuse the modem isn't with the default admin/password fields. 
i don't have access to change the configuration. 
i think my internet provider changed that. 
i tried reset (according to the siemens website - ) the modem to the factory configuration but the reset doesn't work too. 
i don't know what to do... thanks for your help.
