i have laptop running windows xp pro and a desktop with windows98 that i would like to network together. 
ive tried with no success. the laptop is wireless and i use a linksys router. the desktop ,however, is connected through the modem via usb due to the fact it does not have ethernet. 
on both when i go to the network they just have themselves on there and not the other. 
another problem is i can ping from my laptop to my desktop but i cant the other way around. 
can anyone tell me how i could network these together?
