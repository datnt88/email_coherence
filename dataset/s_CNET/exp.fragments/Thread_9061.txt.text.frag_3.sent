on the system bios and the os .

down to the service pack. 
one way around an old or outdated system bios... is a hard disk controller with a bios that allows large hdds. 
that circumvents the hw problem ... you still need to address the os limitations. 
re a utility that tells you exactly what's the largest hdd you can install in any system (and access all the space), there isn't one that i know of.
