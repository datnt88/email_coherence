is it running ? 
generally speaking....i lean towards the largest, fastest hdd my system will support. 
the size in gbs depends... but mainly i go for as big as i can get without paying a significant premium for the next size up. 
if a 200gb was $50 and a 300gb was $55 or $60 same quality speed, i'd go for the 300gb. 
if a 400gb was only $10 more....i'd probably opt for that too. 
but if a 500gb was $100 and i didn't really need 500gb...i'd get the 300gb or the 400gb. 
my current laptop has two 750gb 7,200rpm hdds and i use the 2nd hdd as a backup for the everything on hdd number one. 
vapcmd.
