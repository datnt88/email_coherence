xp pro- if it's a website build it'll only cost 50$ or less to do it now and you'll like the features / controls better right off the bat ( some builder / suppliers if leaned on will upgrade to pro for no charge.) make sure it comes with real recovery disks-not a partition on the hd, bigger hard drive ( you'll wish for more space in less than 6 months) perhaps the ati agp card instead of the geforce-more ram up front-1gb at least.
