i have a problem on one of our home's computers. 
last night the computer was working fine, but this morning, when the computer was turned on i got this error on the bios screen: &quot;remove disks or other media and press any key to restart&quot; the only problem is, there is no media in the only drive on the computer. 
it doesn't have a floppy drive and it only has a dvd-rom and there's nothing even in that drive. 
i hope someone here can provide some guidance on this. 
thanks. 
oh, btw system specs are: athlon 64 x2 5600 msi k9mm-v mobo 2gb ram winxp home sp2 if you need any more info, just let me know. 
once again, thanks!
