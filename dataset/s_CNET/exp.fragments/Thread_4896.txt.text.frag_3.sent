well to begin the process you said the dvd drive has worked fine since you installed it, this could mean your only looking at a loose ide cable either on the back of the drive or on the board itself.verify 
if it shows in the control panel...go to start, settings, control panel...double click system then look in the device manager for cd roms. 
if it shows correctly you might have a defective drive or the software to play dvd's might be the problem...try playing a audio cd. let me know what you find!!
