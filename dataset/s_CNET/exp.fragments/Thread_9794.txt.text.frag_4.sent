you've tried multiple known good devices to attempt a connection. 
you'd also need to get into the router's web interface and check its settings as far as ip addressing, its address and security settings. 
you'd start by using the &quot;no brainer&quot; dhcp function and disabling any security. 
you'd do the same with a laptop/desktop. 
if all goes well, they should connect automatically and you can watch the process. 
there are other things you can check in pcs such as running &quot;ipconfig&quot; to check your address and make sure it matches the range of the routers. 
you can attempt to &quot;ping&quot; other devices on the network and see if you get a reply. 
i won't get into the details of this yet but it's a fairly simple troubleshooting method to get things started.
