all firmware and bios' are up to date. 
drive is brand new (lens cleaning should not be an issue) and the media is unhandled until placed directly into the burner. 
i have never &quot;failed&quot; a burn, they are all &quot;successful&quot; just the data on it does not appear... like i said, programs show that there is data on the drive (alcohol 120% has something called a cd/dvd manager that allows you to read in hexidecimal, every sector of the disc... it shows data throughout the entire disc) but windows itself cannot see the files on the disc... i also burn the discs not at full capacity since this is cheap media... what else could be an issue?
