most modern motherboards are equipped with connectivity for 2 sata drives and the usual ide complement of room for 4 ide devices. 
therefore most people can run 6 devices note that each sata connector must not be shared you may only connect 0 - 2 sata devices and 0 - 4 ide devices.if 
you need more devices you can add more device controllers in a pci slot and you can add data storage devices as usb devices, if you get crazy don't forget to upgrade your power supply. 
there are two things to keep in mind, do not overload your power supply or strange difficult problems will begin to occur and make the correct bios settings for your data storage device complement. 
i'm using an asus p4p800-vm mobo and it requires an advanced (not for beginners says the user guide) bios setting to use both serial-ata and parallel-ata devices. 
enhanced mode device support must be set on to use a mixed device configuration. 
my best advice is read your documentation if you don't understand it have your dealer help you and then do what it says, and really be certain to use an adequate power supply. 
i'm using 3 maxtor hd's 80 & 120 gb sata + 200 gb pata, and 3 dvd burners benq 1625, & 1610, + lg gsa 4163b. 
an ati aiw 9600 video & creative sb audio card + web cams and dual monitors + tv, logitech thx 560 watt surround sound and serving a small lan and sharing my hp1210 psc on the lan. 
oh yes and too many fans trust me about the power supply problems i'm removing some fans so i hope that i don't have to replace my power supply, mixing sata and pata is great otherwise.
