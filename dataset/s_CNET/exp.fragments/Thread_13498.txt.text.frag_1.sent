i am attempting to see if an hp 1702 can be salvaged. 
the monitor flickers even before the pc is turned on, and continues to flicker after the operating system has loaded. 
i opened it up. 
checked the capacitors on the main board and the power supply. 
they look good, but could they still be the cause, or is something else more likely?
