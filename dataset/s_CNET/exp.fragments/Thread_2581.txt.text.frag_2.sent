windows internet connection sharing (ics) will do it. 
just run the windows network setup wizard. 
however... i highly recommend purchasing a broadband router. 
it adds an extra layer of security (firewall, filtering, etc.) between your computers and the dsl modem. 
also, a router will allow your laptop to use the dsl internet connection without having to turn on your desktop, as ics requires. 
i recommend purchasing a wireless-g broadband router. 
most allow you to make 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time.
