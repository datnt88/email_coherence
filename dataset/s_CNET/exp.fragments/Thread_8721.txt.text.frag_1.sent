hello to all! 
i am hoping for a little help again. 
here are my specs model : dell dimension 2400 chassis type : space saving service tag : fr99741 operating system : microsoft windows xp home edition service pack 2 (build 2600) hard drive 1 : st380011a serial number : 3jv94tcb size : 76.29 gb buffer : 2048 kb hard drive type : ata current transfer rate : udma-100 max transfer rate : udma-100 volumes : c : size : 76.25 gb (34.95 gb free) optical drive 1 : hl-dt-st dvd-rom gdr8162b type : dvd-rom drive current cd read speed : 20x ( max 48x ) optical drive 2 : teac dvd+rw dv-w58e type : dvd/cd-rw combo drive current cd read speed : 40x ( max 40x ) current cd write speed : 32x ( max 32x ) problem : i can only burn music cds with my drive. 
i used to be able to put pics on either cd or dvd disks. 
i also used to be able to put video onto a dvd (home movie) i have dvd decryptor, dvd shrink, and windows(for my pics). 
most forums that i have read say that my drive has gone bad; they dont tend to last very long. 
i guess my question is why can i burn music cds but when i try to burn pictures or movies my software doesnt recognize that there is media in the drive. 
i have tried dvd-rw and dvd+rw , cd-r and cd-rw media. 
i have also tried to troubleshoot using windows but i dont get anywhere. 
i am hoping there is a simple fix that i have over looked.
