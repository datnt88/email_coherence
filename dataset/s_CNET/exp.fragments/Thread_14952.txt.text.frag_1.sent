i have just bought an inspiron e1505 with intel pro 3945 and dell 350 bluetooth internal wireless cards. 
i'm thinking about setting up network in my house. 
so i 'm consider between a wgu624 with a wgt624. 
i'm a newbie at this, so i need advice about seeting these things up. 
which device do you think have simplier setup. 
if you have another recommendation, please go ahead. 
i am seeking for help and advice. 
thanks!!!
