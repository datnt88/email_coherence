oem operating systems are locked to the motherboard and generally cannot be transferred. 
you can call emachines about that and see if they'd be willing to help you out, but chances are you'd need to start looking into purchasing a new copy of windows. 
other than that it should be a relatively smooth transition. 
john p.s. for those wondering, that is an emachines t6420, not a t640.
