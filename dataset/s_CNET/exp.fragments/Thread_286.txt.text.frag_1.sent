i had a bad virus in my comp. 
so i did a clean install using a new xp sp2 cd, not hp recovery cd's. 
everything works fine now, video, ethernet, sound, usb (front and back). 
but when i go into my device manager i have a yellow question mark on &quot;unknown device / pci standard isa bridge, driver not installed&quot;. 
i have been searching high and low all over the net for 3 day's trying to find the correct driver needed. 
i have updated all my chipset with latest ati and hp drivers, windows update is up-todate. 
i have used the unknown device program to help find the correct driver but none on them have worked? 
i would preferr not using a driver robot partially because they charge and have used in the past and have not had good results. 
i have also tried uninstalling device and rebooting, still shows up. 
and i have not installed any other hardware. 
i have also searched this site looking for answers and tried a few drivers in downloads but cant seem to find exactly what i am looking for. 
since everything is working properly do i even need a driver for this and can i just disable it? 
i'm a little stumpted here on what to do?
