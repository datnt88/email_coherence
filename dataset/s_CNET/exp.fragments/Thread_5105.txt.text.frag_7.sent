in outline format. 
1. i would create an image of the raid 1 array and store that on another hd. 2. i would create the raid 5 array on a new set of hds using the bios utility to do such. 
(this will break the raid 1 array) you will also want to make sure your hd selection is designed for raid operation. 
3. i would restore the image to the new array. 
4. i would attempt to boot the pc. with a little luck and cooperation from the imaging software, this should work since the array is considered as one drive. 
i have used this method to move an os on a single disk to a raid 1 array and it worked fine with xp. i've not gone from one raid configuration to another, however. 
your mb claims to support raid 0/1/5 and jbod. 
good luck.
