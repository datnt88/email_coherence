you don't have nvidia hardware in your laptop. 
if the micrsoft ugprade advisor says you can run aero, you can run aero. 
and i'm typing this message on a laptop based on i945gm + gma950 running aero with vista ultimate. 
download cpu-z and gpu-z if you want to find out precisely what your laptop has.
