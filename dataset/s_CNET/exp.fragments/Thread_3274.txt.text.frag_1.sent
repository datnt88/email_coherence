hi, we are looking to buy a new desktop urgently. 
we use our pc for internet browsing, email, photos, watching videos/movies/live streams and word, excel, pp etc. we are not technical people at all so are unable to for example, build our own pc or even install windows by ourselves. 
we recently moved to paris so we don't know any local recommended shops who can build a pc for us. it also seems uncommon here in france to find a pc with an english operating system. 
we want a pc were the menus and dialogue boxes are in english, but that supports other languages that we use (incl. 
french, list.cnet.remains 
more_fragments more_threads pre_process.sh 
s.cnet.dev 
s.cnet.test 
s.cnet.train 
scripts threads and hebrew). is windows pro the right choice for us? 
this is what we were offered today in one shop. 
if anyone has any advice on shopping for a desktop in paris and/or in general what brand/specifications to look for and where we can find reasonable prices, kindly let me know. 
many thanks!!
