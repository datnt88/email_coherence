it all worked fine when i first hooked it up. 
i went through netgear's smartwizard, and configured everything for the first time. 
it worked great for a few days, then all of a sudden it started dropping the connection and then reconnecting, now it won't even renew the ip. the router is still working just fine wired, and my computer recognizes the network on wireless, but refuses to acquire the network address. 
maybe just a setting somewhere?
