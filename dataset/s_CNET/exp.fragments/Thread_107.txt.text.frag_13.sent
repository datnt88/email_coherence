move the drive to another machine and partition it there. 
diskpart commands are documented on the web. 
it's not hard to use and the only issue could be you forget to select the right drive. 
with no disrespect intended i think its best to learn the os you are using even if one command at a time. 
my guess is it's the software installed after the os that is at play here unless there is flighty hardware. 
one member revealed the drive had been dropped after we went through all the steps.
