with a corrupted hard disk, defragging is one of the things you certainly should not do. 
chkdsk with repair option is the only sensible thing. 
all you can do now: format the drive (the partition) and start all over. 
and, yes, you'll lose everything that you don't have a backup of. 
that's a very common thing with external drives. 
there are several reasons this could have happened: 1. bad disk, bad case, bad cable. the best thing to do then: throw away the broken component. 
2. unreliable usb-port on the pc. the best thing to do then: use another usb port. 
3. you didn't 'safely remove hardware'. 
the only remedy: don't do that again. 
4. a one-time power interruption. 
difficult to prevent except using an ups. 5. a one-time software fluke. 
can happen. 
difficult to prevent. 
sorry to read about your loss. 
be more careful in the future. 
maybe the bones collection on dvd (see for example) is a nice birthday present for this year?
