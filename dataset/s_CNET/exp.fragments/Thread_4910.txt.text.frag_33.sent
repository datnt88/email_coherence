i have 10 minutes to finish this posting before reboot &lt;insert wry laughter here&gt;. 
i have a gateway gm5485e and it also has this problem. 
one way to diagnose if you have it to is to check your event logs to see if your system is rebooting almost exactly every hour. 
do this: from the start menu, choose control panel, then click on classic view on the left side. 
open up administrative tools, then open event viewer. 
give your permission to run event viewer. 
within event viewer, on the left side expand the windows logs folder, then select system. 
now on the right side in the &quot;actions&quot; pane, select &quot;filter current log&quot;. 
in the field that says &lt;all event ids&gt;, type &quot;6008&quot; and click ok. now take a look at the list of errors. 
on my list, i see many 6008 errors in groups of typically 3 to 8 that are almost exactly 1 hour apart. the 6008 error code specifies that the system shutdown &quot;unexpectedly&quot;. 
if you see this pattern too, congratulations -- you are the proud owner of a spontaneous reboot problem. 
just as is the case with the others who have posted in this thread and in other blogs, the times when i've been near the computer when the reboot happens, the fan races for 1 to 3 seconds and then comes the reboot. 
my plan is to spend black friday backing up my data and taking the computer back to costco. 
too bad - the price was very good, but i guess you get what you pay for. 
perhaps an hp 9080n is in my future.
