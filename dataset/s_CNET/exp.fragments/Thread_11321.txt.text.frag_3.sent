do a little more reading in the storage forum and you'll find a multitude of ideas on drive or partition backup including imaging. 
personally i don't want to spend the time to find all the cds, the key codes, reload the os, reload the drivers, reload the os and download all the updates, register the sw, reload the application software, set the preferences and defaults, reload the data, etc., etc., etc., just ain't gonna happen here so i use drive imaging sw to create images of drive c: (os and apps) and d: (data). 
i also use a full backup program that does the incremental backups daily. 
while disk corruption or failure is a pain...it's much less a pain when you've got a quick easy way to get back up and running. 
good luck vapcmd
