only you know the end use of the laser printer. 
we have no idea other than you're looking for a deal. 
it's no deal if the need requires a parameter you finally needed, like for labels, color, legal size, duplex, paper trays and wifi, etc.. you get the idea of what your real needs are, otherwise just shop for what feels good, we have no clue. 
you cam always look online from the manufacturer to see what they offer and then on to some vendor(s) to a deal or wait for one.
