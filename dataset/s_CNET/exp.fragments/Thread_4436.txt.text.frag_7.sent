this zar recovery program was great. 
i did not buy the full version but used the free trial one. 
i think its a great item and i'll proably spend the money for it anyway. 
it ran for like 3 days and required a few clicks in between as well, but after itw as done verifying the data, my harddrive was recognised again and i was able to retrieve some data. 
i lost some data, which is unreadable now, but lets say 75% of the data is there, which is great news! can only recommend that link. 
thanks mate. 
helped a lot!!!
