i previously posted on my inability to boot to win 7 with nexxtech 03a10 7-port usb 2.0 hub connected. 
it appears there is a basic problem with the mob of this pavilion computer. 
i found some info indicating this device was only compatible with win xp; the vendor failed to tell me this, i had assumed he would. 
maybe he didn't know either. 
so i acknowledge i must purchase a new usb hub. 
but how do i ensure my next hub purchase is compatible with my hp pavilion desktop? 
there is no mention of os's on the websites, only pc and/or mac. 
i cannot afford to waste more money on dubious computer peripherals. 
any input as to what (brands) to look for would be appreciated.
