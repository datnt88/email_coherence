i installed a program called speedfan 4.32 just to check my computer temperature. 
when i installed it and it first ran, the temps were: cpu 51c ambient 37c hd0 41c hd1 39c when i turned the computer off for the night and restarted it, the temps were: cpu 42c ambient 23c hd0 20c hd1 19c i let the computer on while i was out today and when i returned, all the fans were running in the computer normally, the computer is almost silent. 
with the fans running, the temps were: cpu 38c ambient 28c hd0 32c hd1 31c should all of the fans be running 100% and is it possible that i lost a hard drive because it overheated?
