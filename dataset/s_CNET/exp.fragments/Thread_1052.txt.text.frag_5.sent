if both your usb and ps/2 ports don't work then there is something drastically wrong with the system. 
there is no correlation between usb and ps/2, so if both broke it is not surprising that the serial mouse doesn't work either. 
are you having any other problems with this system? 
how old is it, what hardware are we talking about here, is this a real old system?
