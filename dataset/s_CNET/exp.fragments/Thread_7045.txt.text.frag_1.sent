hello! i have a wd external hard drive. 
it works well all the time. 
however, to my surprise, i could not open it yesterday. 
it only displayed this message: &quot;the drive is not formatted. 
do you want to format it?&quot; i don't know what is going on here. is it failed or corrupted? is it still possible for me to access the contained pictures, videos and documents? 
i know i should have backed up all of them. 
but, this drive is my backup drive. 
help please!
