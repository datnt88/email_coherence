hey dude. 
you are absolutely right about the size and overheating. 
now i have seen the 8800 gtx with my own 2 eyes. 
it measures exactly 10.5 inches in length. 
i measured it because i'm planning to have one in my new system. 
so i would suggest you measure the distance from your available pci-express slot (the one u want to use) to whatever the graphics card may touch. 
if it is less than 11 inches, you probably can't put the gtx in there. 
also, since the gtx is power hungry, it requires two 6-pin pci-e power connections from the power supply. 
make sure your power supply has these connections. 
and, how many watts does your psu output ? 
i would want at least about 700w if i'm planning to have a gtx. 
finally, what kind of cooling does your case have. 
make sure it has good air flow and ventilation, or perhaps you may think about water cooling. 
bottom line is this (for 8800 gtx): about 11 inches clearance, two 6-pin pci-e power connections from the power supply, at least 700w power output, and good cooling. 
about nvida vs ati, i'd go with nvidia. 
i believe its more popular and widely used than ati. 
but go with whatever works best for you. 
hope this helps.
