i only have 5gb of music on my macbook, which i backed up using a flash drive and that's it. 
my macbook is used primarily for surfing the web and not much else. 
i was able to erase my hardrive and reinstall using the osx disc provided to me by apple when i bought my macbook. 
i came out of it just fine, so i'm wondering if i need to buy an external hd considering i don't have much of anything to backup?
