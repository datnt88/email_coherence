but has that computer seen this external box as when it was containing the cd drive? 
it could be the os is assuming it is the same as it was when it was connected before. 
check the device manager under &quot;dvd/cd-rom drives&quot; when it is connected. 
if it shows up there as a cd, delete it by right clicking on the drive and then let windows reinstall it. 
if that does not work, try a different computer. 
another thought would be try a linux live cd. 
boot from that to see what that os does with it. 
if that still shows as a cd drive, then the external box must have an identifier built into the front end. 
in that case, a different box will be needed.
