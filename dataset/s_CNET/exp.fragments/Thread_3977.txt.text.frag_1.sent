hi! i have an old [but great] olympus digital camera. 
it has an 8 mg smart media card. 
i took about one hundred sixty pictures of my students at camp this week. 
i checked from time-to-time to ensure that my pictures were good. 
on the last day of the camping trip i noticed that my camera screen showed a giant exclamation point. 
i could not take anymore pictures. 
i could not view any of the previous pictures. 
when i got home from the trip i inserted the memory card into my computer reader. 
it wanted to format the card. 
i went to rite-aid to use their reader. 
it was not recognized the memory card. 
what can i do? 
i have thirty students whose week of memories may have disappeared. 
again, please help!
