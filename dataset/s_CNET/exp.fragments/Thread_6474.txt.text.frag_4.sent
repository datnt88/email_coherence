i tried the permissions route but for some reason although it recognized the desktop pc it would not let it print. 
any way, after dickering with it for some days i accessed hp, the printer manufacturer, and presented the problem. 
they directed me to download an specific wizard for that printer which i saved on a cd and ran on the desktop pc. it worked perfectly and now i can access printers back and forth between both computers. 
thanks for the input and help.
