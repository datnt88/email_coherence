it was strange after i posted problem i downloaded the latest update to my card--but this time included complete bundle {driver,control centre ete}.it improved but after restart next day zi ended up at square one.this 
seems to continue now over and over~so i guess i may need a new card.any 
suggestion would be welcome.thank 
you for your input.
