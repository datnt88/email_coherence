yes, the only difference i can think of was that i had an older ati card before, with its drivers and catalyst. 
but even then, i had to install the drivers from the cd. i tried it again, this time using the ati driver found on this site, but the same thing happens. 
windows freezes at the same command line. 
i just went through some boxes and i found my old ati, so i'll load it up again and see if i can get those drivers to work. 
would there be any issues if i then try to load the hd2400 again as an upgrade to see if it'll be recognized then?
