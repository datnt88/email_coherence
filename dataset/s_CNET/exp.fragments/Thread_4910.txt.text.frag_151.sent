i bought my lame gm5478 in 8-07. 
this thing has been a nightmare. 
it broke down within the 14 days, but my husband simply thought it was a flawed computer and got another one. 
our second computer has done the same thing multiple times. 
we have replaced the mother board, video card, and fan. 
i sent my computer in 12-10 for repairs, as it would not start up. 
gateway has my computer again, as i had to send it in on 1-19 for the hourly reboot issue. 
honestly, i have read multiple posts about this issue. 
fixing bios, replacing power supplies,etc. 
however, i know nothing about computers really. 
i paid $1600 for a fast running computer that was supposed to be able to handle playing some video games and for a mom like me to store her photos. 
i should not have to be an expert on computers. 
it should work. 
after the multiple times i have sent this lame computer in, i have lost a lot of data, photos, had to reinstall every game, program. 
it is time consuming. 
i do not think i should have to pay geek squad $150 every time this computer has a flaw to back up my data when it is a design issue. 
moreover, getting customer service is a joke. 
if you go to their website and google gm5478, you can't even find it. 
getting a live person on the phone is even harder. 
i do have the extended warranty, so if this thing breaks down one more time, i am demanding they junk it. 
i will never buy a gateway again. 
they pretend they have no knowledge that my computer's symptoms are a common problem. 
they have &quot;never heard of such a problem&quot;. 
sorry to vent, but this last time i got my computer back, i didn't have all my stuff reinstalled for more than a week before this computer started rebooting. 
sad, because when this thing actually works, it is fast. 
i would rather have a reliable computer.
