the neighbor's netgear needed a firmware update, then he had to configure the wireless to turn it on and enter a network name. 
that's all i can offer. 
i also have some linksys wap and another dlink wap and those units underperformed until the firmware was updated. 
in closing, make sure that the wap and your client are on the same rf channel. 
and i won't know how to do this since there is no standard as to the user interface.
