how i solved this before. 
my advice is to use hp.com and their chat or research more on the web (i haven't done this recently so maybe folk have found a better way.) what i did was a factory restore and then install the newer drivers. 
it appears there are other drivers and apps that are required to make this work but hp did not document how to perform a clean install of windows so i can't see what else is required. 
it's usually some chipset (not the gpu!) driver and some helper app.
