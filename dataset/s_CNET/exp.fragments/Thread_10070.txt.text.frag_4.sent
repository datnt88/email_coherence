this problem cannot be because of bad ac power, since it has been in the same room as my computer without any problems and it has done this in both my house and our apt. 
i doubt it is heat stress since it is so bare. 
amd 3200 with one cd rom, 2 sticks of ram, one hard drive and one pci card. 
it is a roomy aluminium mid atx case and 3 fans (one intake, bottom front, one exhaust in the back and one side out.) the psu is an interesting idea. 
this thing uses so little power though... it doesn't even have a floppy drive. 
i guess i'll just get a new mobo...
