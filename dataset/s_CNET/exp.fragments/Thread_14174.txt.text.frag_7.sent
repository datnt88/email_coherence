the emachine you are describing is the t3103 ...simpron 3100 processor and is on sale at circuity city until saturday night with 17&quot;crt(large-not lcd) monitor and printer for $419.97. 
this is apparently a new product as emachine does not have it listed yet, and i am unable to tell if it has a agp or pcie slot for graphics upgrade. the compaq intel pentium4 processor 515j (2.9ghz) desktop package that you describe is shown in the circuit city flyer, but not online. 
it is also on sale with 17&quot; crt(large-not lcd) monitor and printer for $549 until saturday night. 
it has integrated on board graphics with the intel 915gv chipset, so does not have an agp or pcie slot. 
when you see media or digital reader 8-1 or 9-1, it is the same as memory card reader. 
as others have suggested, i would also suggest waiting on the t6212 sale package to reappear. 
it was on sale around the 1st week of last month for $549.98 with 17&quot; crt(large-not lcd) monitor and printer at circuity city and best buy.
