for the typical user there's no need for wd40 use inside the system. 
unless, you're stuck in the jungle or artic circle, forget about it. 
if you want to spray your lectronics, then get one &quot;intended for such usage&quot; and even then more than likely for contact surfaces. 
good luck -----willy
