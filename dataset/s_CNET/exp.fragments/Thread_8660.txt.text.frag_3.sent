your building your own,so your not stupid,and you believe in yourself...that's all i need to know.you've read the specs on each part to insure compatibility. 
i looked up what i'd get on a $394 budget: -msi mb w/o video.has 4 ram slots,and two pci-x 16x slots. 
$49 -amd phenom 3-core 3.0ghz cpu..crap,out of stock for good. 
$70 -rosewill green 700wt power supply w/crossfire . 
$79 -1gb video card (might grab two) $68 ea -seagate barracuda 7200rpm 1000gb h.d. $69 -g.skill ripjaws 4gb ddr3 1600mhz ram (2 sticks for now) $59 using my old hardware & operating system,4-bay case,burner,and roms. 
[not buying a 6-core cpu,too much $] $394 complete.
