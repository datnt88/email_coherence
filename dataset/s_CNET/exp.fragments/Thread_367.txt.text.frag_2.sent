when faced with no power on... i first use a screwdriver or metal pen tip to tap the power on pins rather than rely on the power on switch. 
it it comes up, then the push button switch died. 
next i strip the machine down to just motherboard and power supply. 
if it doesn't power up, then i'm looking at the two possibly bad parts.
