i have a dell dimension 8100 desktop running with xp sp2 with all the new updates and drivers. 
my usb printers are constantly going offline. 
i've updated the drivers, bios, checked cables and uninstalled and reinstalled the usb card and deleted and reinstalled the printers and even moved the card to different slots. 
occasionally i can not see any jump drives when plugged into the 2.0 card. is it the card or is it windows? 
i am hearing alot of bad things about windows xp compatability and usb 2.0 cards.
