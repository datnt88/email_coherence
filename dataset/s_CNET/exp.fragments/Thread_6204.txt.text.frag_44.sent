go to logmein.com. 
they have a free version and then a pro version. 
i use the pro version because you can tap into his or your computer from either one and use it like you are there. 
we have the pro version for three computers and have five computers accessable through the program. 
if one computer just has the free version i transfer the pro version to it until i get what i need. it works perfect for us as there is nothing online it stays on or just between your own computers.
