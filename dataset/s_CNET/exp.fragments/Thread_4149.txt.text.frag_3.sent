well there are 3 reasons i didn't update the bios, 1) i was not totally convinced that this bios chip is the right one for this board, even tho it worked 2) the previously owner had a meltdown after doing a flash 3) it is acting so strange, i.e., running like a much older slower board, the speed of the mobo should be what it is, even with an old bios, yes? 
but i'll do it if you think i should. 
will a bios update make the basic board speed faster (as seen in the memory check at startup)?
