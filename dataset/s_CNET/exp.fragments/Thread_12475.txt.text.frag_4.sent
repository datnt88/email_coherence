it's hard to believe they didn't furnish a cd with a backup copy of the software and a manual. 
that would have cost them just pennies -- i think most companies are now going too far to shave costs. 
then, not to have the software available for download from the web is almost criminal. 
there certainly should have been a big warning about this. 
things like this may be what drove maxtor down to the point they had to sell out to seagate. 
i suggest you contact seagate by email to their customer support people. 
surely they can furnish you the needed software or a workaround. 
if they can not or will not support you on this, it is time to start passing the word about their poor customer support.
