i might expect a driver to improve the performance by at most 10%. 
that means that 10 frames per second will go to 11. -&gt; as to video cards for laptops there are only ones that your laptop maker makes. 
if your laptop maker does not offer such cards then it is not upgradeable. 
if you find people that ask if they can upgrade their laptop video, it just means they haven't been told no enough times. 
-&gt; do the usuals to get by. reduce the game resolution and features.
