the multiplier is fixed and even if the mobo offers settings the cpu will simply ignore them. 
what has likely happened is that you had a &quot;bad&quot; shutdown as interpreted by your mobo logic so it reset the memory bus speed to the lowest setting as a protective measure. 
you should be able to simply go into the bios and set the memory bus speed back to the desired setting. 
various bios's have different ways of referring to this setting. 
some call it fsb, for ddr memory they may memtion the basic speed or the doubled speed [example 133 or 266, for pc 2700 memory].
