add this. 
maybe it'll help with the cpu choice between intel 4-cores & amd 8-cores. 
3 things i basically do: 1. i game. 
never on-line. 
my games are almost entirely simulators. 
simcity4, upcoming simcity limited, trainz 2011, cities-xl, tropico-4, civ-5, junk like that. 
i'm not running & shooting, but sometimes (often) build up humongous maps & metros. 
2. i'm an author. 
my books are almost always 1 of 2 genres. 
#1 is novels built around events which could, or have, happened. 
these require lots of research, so sometimes i may have 50 tabs open on 2 different browsers + my text editor open somewhere else. 
i figure this type usage is more bandwidth/memory intensive, but it does use processor power also. 
#2 type is big eye-candy books, the expensive type with large pretty pictures & little writing which you leave open on the end-table to impress your friends. 
here i may have much fewer tabs open, but they will each contain large hi-res images. 
i may also have 1 or 2 image editors going (photoshop, ultimate-paint, format changers, etc.) so i figure this type is more graphic intensive, less bandwidth, about the same memory. 
3. i'm a very active & somewhat advanced astrophotographer. the images i take through the scopes via ccd are b&w exposed through 4 color filters. 
the result is a set of &quot;fits&quot; files, usually around 1500x1200, & often up to 300mb each, depending upon how long the exposure was. 
all 4 of these will be open at one time in photoshop, while i align, crop, adjust, etc. the final, usually 500mb'ish, then goes through a converter to make it into hi-res tiffs or lower-res pngs. 
very high memory usage, cpu, gpu, everything. 
maybe that info will help a little on which cpu-type is better.
