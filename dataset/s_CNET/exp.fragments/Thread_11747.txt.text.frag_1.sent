at the moment my computer doesn't recognise when devices are plugged into my usb ports (not a hub). 
so now my printer, mp3 player and external hardrive aren't recognised when they are plugged in. 
this has happened without them being removed or in any way altered. 
i run windows xp sp2 and all unused usb ports in the device manager claim they are working properly, however when i get to the &quot;unkown device&quot; (my printer and.or external hardrive - both are listed as unknown devices) i get told the drivers aren't installed - yet when i try to intall them the computer won't recognise the device i want to install drivers to..........any ideas?
