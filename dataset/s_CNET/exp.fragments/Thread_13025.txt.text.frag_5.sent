&quot;if i can talk to knowledgeable tech i will learn what i don't know and may be successful.&quot; 
you ready to go to work? 
start here re-read bob's post. 
a full and complete understanding and history of h/ds' is needed, not just talking. the talking comes after, to clarify understanding and proceedures. 
you will not be succesfull swapping controller cards, period. 
open the h/d case outside a clean room will destroy the drive. 
drop a h/d more than 1&quot; you might get lucky and not destroy the heads. 
trying not to sound harsh. 
just trying to get your attention. 
cause their is no easy way to gaining knowledge.
