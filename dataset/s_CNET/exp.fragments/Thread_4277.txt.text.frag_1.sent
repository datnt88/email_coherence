i'm running a dual-boot setup with windows xp and windows vista home premium and i've gone and put all my documents, music, pictures, and other garbage onto my external hard drive to put it in an easily accessible common location. 
now under windows xp, it works perfectly just as it should. 
in and out of standby, running for days on end, it just works perfectly. 
however, under windows vista, it'll work just fine to start, but it seems that at a certain point, whether it's going into and out of standby or whatever, it'll start up for a brief moment and then spin down again, so when i need something from the drive, it needs to spin up again. 
i've even set turn off hard disks in the power options to &quot;never&quot; and it still idles itself. 
is there anything i haven't though of to solve this problem? 
relevant specs?
