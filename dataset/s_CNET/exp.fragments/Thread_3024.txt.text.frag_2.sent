for now, i've yet to find folk happy with dlna. 
well there is one that frequents the forums but i suspect they are here to disagree at times. 
to answer your question you would have to test both and see if they deliver what you expected. 
for example, many expected fast forward and rewind to work but (surprise?), that's not in the basic dlna specs.
