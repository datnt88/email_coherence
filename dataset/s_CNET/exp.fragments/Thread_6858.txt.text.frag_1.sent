i just built a new vista business 64-bit rig, and i have hooked up my hp photosmart 7960 series printer to it. 
previously, this was hooked up to a xp desktop, and my other xp laptops printed to it fine. 
now that i have my vista rig hooked up to it, my xp laptops can't add the printer. 
when i try to add the printer from the local network, xp says... &quot;the server for the &quot;hp photosmart 7960 series&quot; printer does not have the correct printer driver installed. 
if you want to search for the proper driver, click ok. otherwise, clock cancel and contact your network administrator or original equipment manufacturer for the correct printer driver.&quot; 
after clicking ok, it asks my to located the file &quot;*.inf&quot;. 
i've tried inserting the hp disc that came with the printer and location a driver from there, but that does not work either. 
i've also tried downloading the latest xp drivers for this printer and installing them on my xp laptop, but that doesn't work either. 
help, please!
