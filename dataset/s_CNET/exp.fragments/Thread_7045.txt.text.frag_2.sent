please goto the &quot;storage forum&quot; find the sticky post. the uppermost post on that forum has much info and required details in *possible* rescue of your data. 
understand, any attempts may further reduce recovery of data, the choice is yours. 
also, i like to part that any critical data should be saved to cd/dvd/bd discs as a more safe storage method. 
practically all ext. 
storage media will fail in some way sooner or later, even if yours is a back-up it shouldn't be the sole backup, you now understand why. 
good luck tada -----willy
