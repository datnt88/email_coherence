the data rate of usb 1.1 is too low for dvd recording. 
let's attempt a dvd write at about 600 kbps? 
that's about 4 hours. 
a cd-r at 4x is some 700 mb that at top speed completes in about 25 minutes. 
i actually see 30 minutes. 
so at usb 1.1 and 4,700 mb to a dvd that would be 4,700 / 700 or 3.3 hours. 
and this is if all went well... you'll want an usb 2.0 card since for a pci card it's the cheap solution. 
here's one i used -&gt; be sure to read more at about usb 2.0 on the os in question.
