the idea of these ram memory kits is that all components in it are tested to be as nearly identical as possible. 
this would mean that putting all three sticks from one kit and then putting a stick from another kit could have one odd stick. 
i've personally had no trouble with dual channel systems buying two sticks of the same pn ram rather than in kit form but, technically, that's the idea of the kit. 
so, popular advice would be to buy what's made for mb and do check with the mb manufacturer for ram that's been certified as compatible if you want the best results. 
good luck.
