thanks for your reply, r.profit. 
so what is cloud printing then? 
i honestly don't know exactly but from what i understand it allows you to send a file to a cloud account such as gmail, which i have, and the printer will automatically print it instantly. 
may be i am wrong - or am i correct and it is just that my printer doesn't support cloud printing. 
i don't know.
