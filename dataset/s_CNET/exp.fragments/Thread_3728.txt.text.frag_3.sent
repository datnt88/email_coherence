do replace the bios battery. 
before doing so, enter the bios area and make notes of what the setting are. 
check your manual or upon boot-up if displayed what the &quot;bios key sequence&quot; is required to enter the bios area. 
understand, once you replace the battery in all likeyhood, the bios will reset to default values, thus the reason note down what the previous values were. 
it should make sense once you delve into this. 
good luck -----willy
