note that the system brandon listed does not have a dvd burner and therefore you wouldn't be able to make any dvd's. 
it's a $400.00 system, add approx. 
$75.00 for dvd burner/installation, add another approx. 
$50.00 for an additional 512mb ram (which you should have) and you've $525.00 in the system. 
this is $40.00 less than this system which is a much better deal all the way around for you: the same system here at circuit city only cheaper: other systems at circuit city in that price range: check office depot/staples (especially the gateway systems as they are turning out some really good pcs)................
