so a few months ago i upgraded my ram to 3gb, my power supply to 600w, and put in a diamond viper radeon x1950 pro (pci-e, 512mb) card. 
my problem is that there are games that i would like to buy...(ie: gears of war, crysis, bioshock etc...) however the box requirements list graphics cards for nvidia geforce etc...and that's not what i have... so does anyone know what nvidia cards are = to what i have? 
mine does support direct x 9.0 and i think even 10....
