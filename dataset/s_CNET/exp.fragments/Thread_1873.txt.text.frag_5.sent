for my dell printer. 
i used the cd to set up the print server after i installed the router. 
when i was finished, i had to put in the cd for the printer and tell it i was setting it up for a network printer. 
it will then ask you how you have it setup. 
after you select the right answer, it will then install the drivers for you. 
i don't know if this is what you are looking for or not.
