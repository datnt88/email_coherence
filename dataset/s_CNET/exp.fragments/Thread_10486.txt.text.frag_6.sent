playing around with the file system could leave xp in some need of repair. 
without your cd you can't fix it. 
a simple issue balloons into one big problem and could be costly if you can't get your restore cds made or supplied. 
for example a call from the geeksquad puts in into the 200plusplus range to get the machine working again.
