after discharging any static electricity (see note below) and unplugging the pc get a straightedge and see if somethings bent. 
you my need to replace the motherboard or video card. 
listen for arching electricity. 
a sure sign the gap is too wide. 
look for a black sooty residue on the agp/pci/pcie slot, this means it's been arching. 
arching is bad news. 
what temperatures is this card running at? 
over 70c and you have a problem. 
approaching 70c might be a problem for some boards, over 66c or more. 
check with the manufacturer of the card for the upper temperature limits for this card. 
high operating temperatures might be a sign of poor connectivity between the card and the board. 
the note &gt;&gt;&gt; removing static discharge: care should be exercised whenever dealing with electricity. 
you have not given us your age. 
if under 18 years old your parents must assist you.
