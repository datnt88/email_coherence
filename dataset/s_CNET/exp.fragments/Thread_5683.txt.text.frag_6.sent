i often change the ssid of the router. 
this forces new ips to be handed out. 
then again if someone has hand assigned ip numbers and used one that is in the dhcp range, they created a problem. 
fix? 
don't do that! 
i wonder about your roku. 
i can not check mine today. 
i just moved and i have my roku remote but we haven't found the roku unit. 
i'm left to guess you have not explored all menus. 
as to the laptop, changing the ssid should help. 
if not, the os may have been damaged by malware or registry cleaners. 
-&gt; i asked for which windows os and can't find an answer. 
this severely limits me since i can not write tcpip resets for all 5 versions.
