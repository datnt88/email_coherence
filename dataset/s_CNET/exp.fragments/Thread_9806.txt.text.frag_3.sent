if you know how to build a pc (or know someone who does), shuttle and asus make barebone systems that can be configured to good media center pcs (asus spressoo deluxe even comes with a tv/fm tuner and remote) in fact, i'm assembling one for my sister to take to college soon. 
as for store-bought...i've got no idea there. 
i stopped following the pre-assembled computers a while ago, so i've not kept up wih who's good and who isn't.
