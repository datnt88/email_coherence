thanks for the reply. 
but we just couldn't get it set up. 
so had the geek squad from best buy set it up with all the security and things. 
seems when the qwest dsl set up my dsl account they put a static isp address instead of automatic and that was causing a problem. 
it was worth the $89 i paid the geek squad to set it up for me. 
working great now.
