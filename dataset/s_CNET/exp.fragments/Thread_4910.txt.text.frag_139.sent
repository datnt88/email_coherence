ok, so after applying the bios updates to my gm5478 last year i haven't had any more reboots, and i've been happy with it for several months. 
now, though, when i boot it up (or sometimes just when-ever) i get this weird hum/buzz funky sound like a fan is bound up or something. 
any ideas what this may be? 
did yours sound like this before the 8500gt went out? 
anyone else have this issue? 
what's really great is that the only way i've figured out to deal with it is a sharp blow to the top of the case. 
this usually makes the sound stop. 
i've added another 500gb drive, and am about to switch to 64bit os and 8gb of ram, but i'm thinking maybe i'd better just scrap the thing rather than deal with anymore issues. 
i'm a freelance software/ web developer, so i run lots of stuff most &quot;home&quot; users don't (jde, visual studio 05 and 08, sql server, adobe cs4, virtualbox and vmware for linux virtualization, apache, mysql etc.) and it's been great since the bios update but i'm getting a little sick of never knowing what's up with the damn thing.
