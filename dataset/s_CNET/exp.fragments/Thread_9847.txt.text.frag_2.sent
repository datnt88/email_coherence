yes. but we cure it with bios updates and if the maker doesn't fix it... then we get a new motherboaard or a drive under the magic 127/137gb size. 
there is no cure if they didn't do the bios proper. 
---------------- some fight the jumper settings tooth and nail. 
i'm unsure why people insist that a jumper setting be &quot;this&quot; when &quot;that&quot; works. 
you didn't share the ide cable type you used, the jumper setting of the ide drive and what you tried.
