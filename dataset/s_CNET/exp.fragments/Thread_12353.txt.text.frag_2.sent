&gt;&gt;&gt;all i know is that i want 1 or 2gb ram, been able to play my games online and not having problems with a slow pc. i bet you dont even know why you want 2 gb of ram? 
all i can tell you is do your research. 
a couple of things to look for. 
most ram is pretty much the same (at least with ddr 2). the main difference is how fast the ram is, that is what the 667 mhz, or 800 mhz means. 
usually try to get faster the better. 
667 mhz or 800 mhz would do just fine. 
most of your list seems like it is for a micro computer ( a really small computer). 
is that really what you want? 
go to this site and compare the different processors and see which one would suite your needs. 
if it is not on the list then you probably shouldnt be buying it (its to old). 
i would at least make sure you get a dual core cpu (either one that says x2 or intel core 2 duo). 
what type of games do you plan on playing? 
this is where your graphic card would come into play (pun intended). 
if you want one of the bigger graphic cards (8800 or 2900 xt) then you probably cant go with a micro motherboard/case. 
this well help with game performance but really your internet speed is the biggest with online games. 
you probably are better off picking out what you think you want and then post here and we can make fun of you or praise you for your choice.
