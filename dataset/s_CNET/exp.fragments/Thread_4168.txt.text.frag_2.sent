the wireless adaptor of my laptop detects my home access point and log in automatically. 
taken outside the house, it detects some networks. 
some of these ask for a password forloggin-in. 
my questionis-how do i get of these ? 
how do i protect my access point so that a password is required to access it ? 
(other than not broadcasting the nat address (ssid) ) thanks.
