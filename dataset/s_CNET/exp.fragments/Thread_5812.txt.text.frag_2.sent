if you are spending money, just build it yourself. 
the only time you would ever want to have one prebuilt is if you are going for something that is dirt cheap, or you are incappable of figuring out how to build one yourself. 
since you know what the specs on a machine mean i am fairly confident you know what you are doing and since you are ordering online i assume you purchase things too. 
i would, in your shoes say to hell with it and just build yourself. 
you can save enough money to buy a damn mac mini just to fool around with.
