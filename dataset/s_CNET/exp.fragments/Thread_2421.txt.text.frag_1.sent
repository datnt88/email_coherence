i am using windows me, gateway performance 800 desktop, and generic floppy disk drive. 
floppy drive (a:) has disappeared from my computer and search for files and folders. 
system properties shows the floppy disk controllers/standard floppy disk controller and that there are no conflicts. 
the bios recognizes the floppy drive a and reflects that it is enabled. 
system information recognizes the floppy drive and reflects status ok. in search for files and folders when i search for a: in hard drive c: the &quot;search for&quot; field changes to list.cnet.remains 
pre_process.sh 
s.cnet.dev 
s.cnet.test 
s.cnet.train and the contents of inserted diskette are found. 
does anyone know how i can get the floppy drive back into my computer? 
i have no idea how it got out. 
reverting the hard drive to an earlier date/time doesn't fix it. 
thank you. 
have a great day.
