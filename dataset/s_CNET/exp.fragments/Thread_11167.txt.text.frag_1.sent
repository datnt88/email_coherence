hi there i'm hoping someone can help me with a very annoying problem i recently found. 
there i am enjoying myself playing a game and then the monitor suddenly goes back to the desktop. 
it happens with all the games i've been playing and it happens every 10 mins or so. 
ran a virus scanner but it's still happening. the monitor is a videoseven 17&quot; tft panel and the graphics card is a 9600 pro. 
cheers
