is the server actually a server like the windows home server or the windows server 2003 or 2008? 
are you simply using an xp home edition to share it's folder to the other two computers. 
are all these devices connected to a router or just the hub? 
where is your dhcp or are you using static numbers? 
need more info please. 
how are the two computer connected to the internet? 
unless you are using static numbers, you should have a dhcp running someplace either with the router or your windows home server.
