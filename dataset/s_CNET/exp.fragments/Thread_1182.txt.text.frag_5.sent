thanks for the help. 
i have realized the same thing, the pc works on channel 2, 3, or 4, and my dish box is programmed for channel 116. 
talked with dish, and they say that tuner 2 on the box can only output to channel 60, 73, or 116, tuner 1 outputs to channel 3 or 4. our local dish installer is a neighbor who will stop by to correct for me. 
his price quote was &quot;some beer&quot;. 
again thanks for the help.
