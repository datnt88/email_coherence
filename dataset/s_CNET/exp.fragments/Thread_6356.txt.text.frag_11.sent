im kinda jumping into a convo that i odnt know about cuase i havent read any of the replies, but i had a computer kinda like that and it would reboot autotmatcally when would try to load a level in call of duty. 
i never found out what the problem was, becase i bought a new computer. 
but, i have had the problem where you reboot, and you can see the bios menu and stuff but but when the login to windows starts, your monitor turns off. 
if this is your problem, boot in safe mode. 
then reinstall your graphics card's driver. 
then reboot not in safe mode (normal mode?) then you will get back into windows. 
lol and if your problem has already been solved by these peoples replies then sorry for butting in, and if this has nothing to do with your problem, sorry
