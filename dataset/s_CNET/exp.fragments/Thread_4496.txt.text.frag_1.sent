hello, i am looking for a washable, flexible, 109-key, usb full sized keyboard with, preferably, normal placement of the arrow keys, an enter key that is of a decent size (and is the backwards l type), a full sized backspace key, the full top row of f# keys, etc. etc. i don't know which brand of &quot;flexible and washable&quot; keyboards to get, or which model to get if i *do* decide. 
has anyone done a comparison of any of the keyboards from seal shield, tripp lite, adesso, grandtec, true touch, modtek, targus, etc.? also, how can i figure out if one of these is just a rebranded version of another? 
which of these companies is still alive and supporting their product? 
do any of these keyboards have anything physically different with the f and j keys, to find the home keys by touch? 
if so, which? 
which brands have the lowest incidents of stuck keys for their latest models? 
i am in the states, and would like to pay under $40 for a keyboard (these seem to be relatively inexpensive, which does help!), and i don't know what to get. 
any help would be appreciated!
