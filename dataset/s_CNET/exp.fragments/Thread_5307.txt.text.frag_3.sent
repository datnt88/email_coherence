new video card would be replacing a diamond radeon 9550 agp on a pcchips m825lu micro atx mobo (micro-atx form factor, 244*190mm). 
mobo has agp slot with two pci slots (both slots being used). 
conventional mid tower case. 
as mentioned before the 9550 video card sits next to a pci card slot with a lan card for my wireless internet connection and the fan on the 9550 clears the underside of lan card (or any other card) by 1/8 inch. the height of the fan/heatsink on the diamond 1650 is taller/higher by at least 1/4&quot; than the fan/heatsink on the 9550 video card.
