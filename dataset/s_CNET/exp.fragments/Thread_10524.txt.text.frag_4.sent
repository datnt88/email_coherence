xp, windows 2000, linux all have pretty good disk cache systems. 
if i look at my system, it's 283 megabytes of disk cache which the difference of that 2, 8 or 16 mb on the disk drive would not make much difference. 
may have some benchmarks if you want to look further. the rpms seem to be what you can't skimp on.
