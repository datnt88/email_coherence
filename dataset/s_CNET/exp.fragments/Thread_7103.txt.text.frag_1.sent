the door on my superdrive won't open using the button on the door or with eject from toast software, i have a firewire drive attached and it does open from toast. 
superdrive is a pioneer dvr-103. 
computer is power mac g4 733 digital audio running os x 10.2.8. drive shows up on system profiler and on toast. 
do i have a bad drive?
