i'm having similar issues finding the right printer. 
i'm looking for a black and white printer that can handle the 110lb paper but also has a low cpp because of all the other, normal office printing we do. 
also (because it's a small office), it needs to be relatively small and fit on a desk. 
so far what i've seen is the hp 600 series or p3015n, the oki b700, or the cannon 6780. 
any reccomendations on these or any others that may work? 
thanks!
