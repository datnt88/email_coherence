hi everybody. 
my first post here. 
i have several old computers - everything from 386 to pentium iii and a hp pavilion 6535. 
i no longer have space to store them and so will be getting rid of them. 
i want to strip out the components worth saving. 
i 'm keeping the hard & floppy drives and the dvd/cd-rom drives. 
the batteries - most of them still keep excellent time. 
ide cables and removable power cables. 
what about the following for the pentium 1 and up? 
psu (power supply unit) fans mother boards video card sound card anything else? 
(i know that these components in the 386/486 aren't worth saving. 
or are they?) if you're scratching your head wondering why i think a pentium 1 component may be worth keeping, it's because i'm using a pentium 1 (windows nt 4.0) for non-internet use. 
would be perfect if not for the paltry 2gb hard drive. 
one final question: how does hp pavilion 6535 compare to the pentium 1? i have searched on the internet, but can't find the year the hp was released. 
i will say this, though - the hdd is in an upright position and everything is jammed together to make it impossible to remove and insert cables, power supply cords, etc. several times i wanted to take this particular computer out onto the street and smash it apart. 
thanks!
