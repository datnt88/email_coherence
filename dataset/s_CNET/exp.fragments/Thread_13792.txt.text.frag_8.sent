what happened was i had two different models of the gtx460... an msi cyclone and a pny xlr8 (both 1 gig) the pny one tended to be quite audible vs the msi due to its heatsink design being different, as well as the heat lvls being a little bit higher, so thats why i decided to change the paste. 
it was absolutely caked on both of them, probably more then 4x more than needed when i removed the sinks so it was definately in my interest to do so especially since i use mx4 paste which is pretty good quality vs what the manufacturers use i'm sure
