hello, i tis not anti virus problem. 
those anti-virus i use are just online scanner that i use to scan my computer. 
after i done scan, it all have been uninstal. 
the only one antivirus i have in my computer is norton, and i know is not norton problem because i have use norton for many years. 
i have try update all the drives (it say all your drive to up to date) and i try unplugging modemn for like 2 hours and plug it back in. the verizon dsl also reset my whole modemn, and the problem still persist. 
(so it definately not modemn issue) something is going on in my computer. 
it is not software issue since i have try safe mode networking many times, and my internet speed still fluctuates, so this rule out the software conflict problem. 
i scan my computer with all of these: norton, mcafee, kaspersky, housecall, esset, including malwarebyte and lavasoft, and found nothing!! if there is a virus in my computer, then it super powerful then since all of these anti-virus cannot even detect them. 
(unlikely it is virus issue) my computer is very hot though, and it have some sound like something is running inside. 
maybe my computer is overheated? 
how to know if the nic or network card inside my computer is not working correctly? 
my internet is so slow right now, i am so frusterated, thank you for helping me.
