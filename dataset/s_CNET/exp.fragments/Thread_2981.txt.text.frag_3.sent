i had the same problem: i'd set the registry key hkcucontrol paneldesktopwheelscrolllines to 1 and it would change to 3 on reboot. 
well, something would change it to 3 on reboot. the challenge is to find out what is doing this. the solution: load a registry monitor that will do boot-time monitoring, like sysinternals regmon ( ), and check the log to see what is changing the registry key in question. 
be sure to read about regmon's boot-time process here: as the boot-time log can be large. 
mine was 75mb. 
my culprit was a pointing device driver for my laptop that was configured in control panel to be disabled, but was still applying some of it's settings. 
good luck.
