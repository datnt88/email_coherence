usb devices can be flaky and there's no end to stories like yours. 
i've had a couple, however, that were resolved by simply going into the hardware screen, removing the device, restarting the machine and letting windows redetect it. 
it should have retained the driver and will reload it. 
now, it does sound as if your device needs more power than most. 
such could be the root cause of your issues. 
what xp will detect is the controller for the drive and the controller will then configure the drive itself. 
at this time, windows should see the drive. 
can you tell if controller is seen but not the drive? 
these devices need a bit more current than most others and the lack of power from the 5v to the usb header might be a clue.
