when oc'ing you'll need to tweak your fsb and ram speed seperately. 
a 400mhz fsb is the simplest oc for that processor. 
it will raise the cpu from 2.66ghz to 3.2ghz and you'll still be able to run your ram at ddr2-800. 
any good motherboard will be to do this with a good cooler(like the noctua) and all that might be necessary is a gentle vcore push. 
if you want to go higher, you should probably opt for ddr2-1066 and be prepared for a lot more tweaking. 
with a 420mhz fsb you could run at ddr2-840 or ddr2-1050 depending on the ratio you choose. 
heat will also become more of an issue over 400mhz fsb.
