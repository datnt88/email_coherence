thanks to the person who has taken effort to reply- thanks bob. it maybe hard to understand, but i did what i was trying to do- and learned more about drives. 
sata controllers work independantly- i was pretty sure. 
there was no reason why my old formatted drive should not show up. 
but only my new drive that had been formatted showed. 
i just fooled with the windows cd and loaded some of the drivers from the cd. and low and behold this drive is now reconized in my computer. 
i put both on the sata master inputs(the red ones)- i did this before so i think the drivers on the windows cd helped the windows install reconize the drive. the bios has always reconised it (drive that wasnt seen in windows). 
now if i could just find a good program or find a way to transfer files- but now that i think. 
datalifeguard will probly work. 
thanks, bye.
