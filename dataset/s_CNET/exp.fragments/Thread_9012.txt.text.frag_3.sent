i had two adapters (external and internal), which may have conflicted with each other; disabling one didn't work. 
i opted to using the internal adapter only; threw the external card into my laptop bag. 
i had to uninstall, then reinstall client and drivers. the installation process is automatic if you're using xp. after reboot, everything was fine. 
hope this helps.
