i thought i had also covered all the bases...i still think this is the simplest of issues: an altered bios setting of some type, but i cannot seem to enter it. 
i researched the combination of keystrokes to enter on this motherboard and it is just supposed to be the 'del' button. 
i have attempted this a couple of times already and still no data being transferred to the screen. 
i have also used a couple of different monitor cables. 
i haven't actually changed anything as far as layout goes, all i did wass reseat everything and clean it up. 
does anyone know if maybe there is a different keystroke to enter the bios? 
i should be able to see what i am accessing since it isn't even running the drivers and such right? 
omg! 
i am so frustrated lol. 
thanks so much for the help so far, fellas.
