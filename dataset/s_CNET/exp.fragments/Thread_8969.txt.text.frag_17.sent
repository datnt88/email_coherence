i wipe and reformat about once a year or if i choose to change what i am using my machine for something else. 
i had a home network with a printer connected to my machine shared by the other four wired machines and one wireless connection to a laptop. the issue was when the vista laptop was hooked up to the network, wired, all the other machines could no longer see my machine. the vista machine could see every machine but mine. 
i went through all the network troubleshooting i could and spent hours doing methodical changes, one at a time. 
nothing fixed the issue. 
i finally decided i wanted a clean machine again, so i wiped my drive and did a fresh install. 
when i booted into windows, every computer in the network could see and access each other. 
there was something hidden that even savy network troubleshooting couldn't find. 
i went so far as to cascade switches as i only had four port ones and had six machines to network. 
no matter what network topology i used, everybody could access everyone else's shared folders. 
sometimes it's the only way to fix a nagging problem like that. 
funny, though, except for networking my machine was working fine.
