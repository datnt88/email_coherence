i've know a lot of people that have installed linux on their usb drives. 
i have a walkman nwz-a818 and it shows up in &quot;my computer&quot; like a hard drive. 
it doesn't have a letter though, but it's just like a hard drive and i can put any types of files onto it, make new folders and stuff. 
so, is it possible to run linux on it? 
thanks
