im sorry bob i am not the best with wording. 
i was going to get a pcmcia card with usb2.0 and sata connection for my labtop so i could hook up a esata hard drive, the guy i talked to said to get the esata combo drive with active cooling( i dont know what that is). 
i can find the pcmcia card but was wondering what your take is concerning the esata drives and if you could lead me to a good manufacturer of them 200-300gb with this active cooling, is this for the hard drive or for the labtop as you suggest?
