what bloatware? 
i own the aspire one atom powered unit and didn't find such. 
what did you consider bloatware? 
and i see no reason to bump the ram. 
i only use it for running out of the office for demos, patching up our applications so my view is that it is no laptop replacement. 
it's a fine get out there for cheap spare laptop (but it's no laptop!) bob
