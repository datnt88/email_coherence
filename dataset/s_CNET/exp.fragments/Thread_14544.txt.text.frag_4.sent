thank you ! 
strange how i would notice - over many years - the 8 larger black chips - but never notice that one, much smaller, tiny black chip. 
so &quot;registered&quot; chips are the ones with the &quot;u&quot;. 
these chips have a clock cycle delay. 
the unbuffered chips are the one without the &quot;u&quot; (sounds like reverse polish notation). 
it also means i can not &quot;mix and match&quot;. 
but in this case: i can remove the 256mb unbuffered chip, and replace it with two 256mb registered chips. 
thus putting 512mb safely on the computer - a step up. of course, this all assumes the chips &quot;fit&quot; (one versus two notches - and not on a dell which moved the notches thus making their memory &quot;propriatary&quot;).
