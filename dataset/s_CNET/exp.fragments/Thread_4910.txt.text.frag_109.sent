since dhl dropped this pos out of the cargo bay and i stuck the plastic trim pieces back on with silver tape....well not once did it take over the on off switch, not once did it reboot. 
what did happen is the power supply just failed and i put another ps in ($27) not warranty, gateway voided it remember. 
going on 2 weeks with the new power supply so go figure.
