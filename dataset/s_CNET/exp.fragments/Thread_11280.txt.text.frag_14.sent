get this. for some reason now i can not burn cd's, but can burn dvd's fine on the same drives. 
i was using nero 6.6. 
upgraded to 7.0, still doesn't work. 
i verified drivers and that dma is turned on. 
the nero people told me the intel iaa is causing the problem, but it's only installed for the sata drives. 
any ideas?
