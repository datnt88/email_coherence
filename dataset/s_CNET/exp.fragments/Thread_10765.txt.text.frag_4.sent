if you have opened up a case before and changed gfx cards etc...then you can build it. 
ive done it 3 times, and it takes around 2hrs + time to install stuff. 
like the above poster said at 500$, you cant beat the store ones (unless you find a free copy of windows). 
above 700$ and you can definitely out do any walmart pc. plus, you will have a cool (both temp and looks wise) case, your components will all have individual warranties etc.. like i said, my experience prior to my first build was changing gfx cards, changing a psu and adding a soundcard. 
my last advice: id check out forums. 
find the homebuilt section and people often post deals of the best equip at the best price and where to get it. 
also, you can see if what you want is all compatible.
