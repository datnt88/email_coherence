the ep35 mainboard has the intel p35 chipset which is to my understanding inferior to p45. 
to the psu, well the whole case is $60 including psu with 12cm fan, i dont want to spend another $60 on a psu if its not absolutely needed... what can happen if the power supply gets overpowered? 
can this damage any of my components? 
ok and last question, is there any noticable performance drop by running the ram on different clock than the cpu, or it does not care? 
in my original configuration they both run @1066mhz. 
thanks again, j.m.
