hi bob, i replaced the guest (win mn.) computer only. 
i should tell you that a few days ago, i had the system working fine on these same two same computers with a 100% signal. 
i then decided to reformat the hard drive on the guest computer. 
i did that and then replaced the software etc. it tells me that i'm getting a 67% signal but won't log on to the internet.
