it is extremely unlikely you can recover your system after all the errors it found and corrected, you may have already lost all your data because of running the repairs you ran. 
your only real hope of getting your data off is to get another drive, install windows on it and then put this drive in as the second drive and try and copy off the files that have not been damaged.
