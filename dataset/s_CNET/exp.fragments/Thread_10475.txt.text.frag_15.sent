i want to add my gratitude for your patient and sagacious advice. 
i have to confess that at the end i am returning to your original advice:get a spank new dvd drive! 
once i saw how inexpesive they become since i bought mine i feel i can buy one every month and chuck them out like a used lollypops.thank 
you again,with my best,henryk.
