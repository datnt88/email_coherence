i have had a similar problem twice recently,the first time about 3months ago was a virus(i had to format my os harddrive)and more recently a faulty usb device (my webcam),if your sure its not a virus unplug all your usb devices (incl.key board & mouse if necesary-use non usb devices) if no joy it could be your psu loosing/low power output? 
good luck maurice
