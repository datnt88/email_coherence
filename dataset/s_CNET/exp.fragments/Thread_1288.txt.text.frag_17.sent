hi, i apologise for the scrappy grammar but im real tired an bin up 4 wot seem like weeks and jus cant remember how fixed this last time, sumhow i got a hotfix but cant remember where. 
my partners daughter plugged her ipod in2 my comp and then booted up, i walked in jus as it went black safe blah blah. 
i thought the worst(afta all ipods r hdd's now an it looked like it tried bootin frm that but wen i turned off an on it booted normally wiv no prbs. 
only whilst tinkin i might not actually hav 2 murder my man's eldest i saw i now had a cd drive instead of a dvdr/rw drive. 
an nothin i can do rollbacks etc will change its mind, its either goin thru identity crisis or its bin completely knocked out of system since i now have no dvd drivers in windows wotsoever only cd ones, lite on site is rubbish since wen u try an get drivers its nowhere to be found (it turns out its called a completely different model and number an i have 2 guess which. 
i seem 2 remember last time i was searching 4 the solution lots of people saying same thing so i know its fixable and without reinstallin bloody windows, i jus cant remember where i finally found help last time plz help, i built this computer myself and hav been learnin on a need to know basis and ive learned loads cos nowt like takin things apart an puttin back 2gether to c how they work but i didnt save this fix an am in a rut.
