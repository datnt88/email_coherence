sounds proper to me. 
it's simple physics. 
with that omnidirectional antenna, the power emits in all directions and exponential decreases as you move away. 
another router/wifi unit has the same laws to contend with. 
if you are the only user, fashion an deflector like this -&gt; parabolic antenna for wifi found with this google.
