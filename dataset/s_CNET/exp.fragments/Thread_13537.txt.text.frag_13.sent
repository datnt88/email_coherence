using a mounted drive. 
we create very little material to backup so this method works for us. 
we started doing this after repeated failures using cds/dvds and acronis. 
takes about 10 minutes and can backup everything but settings and programs, emails are a little more complicated but everything else is very simple and quick to backup. 
this thread is untracked. 
bang!
