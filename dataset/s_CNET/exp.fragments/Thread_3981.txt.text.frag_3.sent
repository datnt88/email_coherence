i have made some recent changes: motherboard: optical drive: usb 3.0 card: i want the desktop to be able to handle 1080p movies (blu-ray or not). 
should i still go for a cheaper mother board with built in graphics? 
also, is the stock heat sink enough? 
the case comes with 2 fans but i was thinking of adding another. 
what do you think?
