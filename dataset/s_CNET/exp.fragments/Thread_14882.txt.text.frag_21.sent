if yes, get 2 fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads 2gbs=4gb or better yet 2 fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads 4gb=8gb.....otherwise if/when you want to add ram...you won't have to pull out ram to install the new ram. 
better you get 8gbs (2*4gbs) now that have to do it later. 
let us know how it turns out.
