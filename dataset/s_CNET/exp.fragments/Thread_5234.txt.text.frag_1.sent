i was updating my hardware drivers last nite and did the one listed for the bios from the hp website. 
upon doing this the computer froze. 
when i started it back this message comes up on a black screen. 
award bootblock bios v1.0 bios rom checksum error detecting floppy drive a media insert system disk and press enter wireless keyboard and mouse wont work so i was forced to hold down the power button to shut it back down. 
i have tried restarting pc and pushing f keys. 
nothing but the same message would come up. 
i think went on another computer and had a chat online with a hp tech. 
they suggested i start it up and push the f10 key every second and the bios setup screen would appear. 
tried this numerous times with no success. 
i have also tried putting in my vista recovery disks that i created from this computer. 
still doesnt work when started up, and the light on the dvd/cd player is on and working. 
after pushing the f10 key and nothing happening. the tech then suggested i send the computer to them for repair. 
i was going to see if anyone had any answers before i look for outside help at some repair place. 
please help me if possible someone.
