np jbking2 i see what u mean there remarc. 
i really was hoping to keep it under 1k but this duel monitor set up idea has me intrigued, and if i can make a 22&quot; work with my 17&quot; i think i might get one, but what will i need? 
do i need another gfx card for the new monitor? 
if i do then should i buy 2 8800s or what?
