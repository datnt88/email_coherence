hi it sounds that you are maybe not aware of what components you computer is made up from. 
either try getting someone you know who knows what they are doing to look at it for you or alternatively take it to a computer shop and ask them what if anything you can do with it. 
not the best advice and probably not what you wanted to hear but i think probably the most sensible in this case.
