make sure that all the devices are of a similar protocol. 
if you have an odd 802.11b device (like a built-in wireless on an older laptop) lurking in the mix, that could slow things down on the whole network. 
furthermore, the security encryption takes a small toll. 
if the transfer is between two wireless links, the available bandwidth is divided between them, e.g., a 54mbs nominal network will spend half its time communicating to system a and the other half its time to system b, so only 27mbs can move in either direction. 
add to that the crosstalk for operating system error checking, etc. and pretty soon it slows to a crawl.
