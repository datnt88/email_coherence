i am currently looking for a new desktop and don't really know which one to get. 
i am currently looking at the new sony vaio, the dell 8400, and the power mac. 
if you have another suggestion than those listed please feel free to let me know. 
i will primarily use the computer for gaming, downloading music, burning cds, and surfing the web. 
money is not really an object, so which desktop do you think is the best out there? 
any help is much appreciated.
