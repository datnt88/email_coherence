use the finder and input your pc's specs. 
crucial will tell you what you need. as another/repeat thought, two gig is still waaaaaayyy overkill. 
unless you're mapping the human genome you'll never use or need two gig. 
if it works with one gig, return the other stick. 
i really forsee problems in trying to make this work. 
if the pc was happy with two gig, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
