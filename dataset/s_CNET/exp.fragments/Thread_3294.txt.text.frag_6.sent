that emachines use to get into the bios. 
it varies. the option only happens during early parts of the booting process. 
many computers show a message &quot;to enter set-up&quot; hit {they then give the name of the key]. 
as an example for most non proprietary computers it is the del key. 
hopefully the manual will tell you what key to hit and when. 
surely someone else in these forums will know. 
just realize that even though the actual function you want is set-up, it is usually referred to as the bios or as the cmos. 
they're really slightly different terms but not worth worrying about is you get into that place. 
lol
