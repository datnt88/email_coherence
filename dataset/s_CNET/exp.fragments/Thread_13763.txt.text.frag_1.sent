i'm replacing my old sound card. 
i just bought a set of logitech z-5500 thx speakers. 
i almost bought this card but i found out i couldn't make a direct digital connection to the speaker systewm via optical or digital coax. 
so i'm seriously considering getting this card i have seen some reviews where people had problems with crackling popping etc if they use a mobo with an nvidia chipset. 
here's what it says on auzentech's site &quot;q: why do i hear cracking and popping in the audio? 
a: apparently this problem can affect a portion of users using soundcards based on the x-fi chipset in computers that include nvidia hardware. 
below is a quote from nvidia: creative and nvidia have been investigating reports of performance issues in some systems that have nvidia components as well as creative's sound blaster x-fi soundcard installed. 
there were complex, bandwidth-related issues involving memory allocation that made isolation of the issue and subsequent resolution time consuming and difficult. 
after thorough qa and testing, nvidia released a bios update for motherboards designed by nvidia and based on the nvidia nforce 680i sli mcp, which has resolved such issues. 
for any x-fi owners using these motherboards but are still experiencing issues, we advise you to contact your motherboard manufacturer regarding the availability of an updated bios.&quot; i am using an asrock 939 dual sata2 mobo which has the uli 1695 chipset (uli m1695/ uli m1567) . 
anyone think there would be any problems using this sound card with my mobo? 
i'm running xp sp2 thanks
