but the reasons why windows takes a dive is fairly well discussed. 
the repeating issues i encounter are motherboard chipset drivers and that setting. 
you may have seen me write about the dma flip many times. 
it's a simple procedure and one that must be done even if you see xp report &quot;dma.&quot; 
why? it lies.
