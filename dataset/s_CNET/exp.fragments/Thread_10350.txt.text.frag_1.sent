hp deskjet 3420 model printer, very new and the printer head won't move when sent a print job. 
can hear a spinning sound like it's trying to move. 
was working fine. 
have checked all settings and all appear to be correct. 
any suggestions? 
i'm not a techie so simple answers would help greatly. 
thanks!
