the actual recording time should be about the same with your cpu and some 2+ ghz cpu. 
what will change is the encoding time. 
it's very linear to cpu power. 
if you had a twice as fast cpu, it would take 1/2 as long. 
any under 1,000 buck desktop will do this much faster but none (at that price) will break it down in less than say, one hour.
