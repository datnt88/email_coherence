there is no answer to the telephone number - just the same recording saying it is &quot;faster&quot; to contact them by email and then goes on to say that they can/will take no calls. 
i'm having the same experience as a previous post of slow to no response (though they responded saying there's been a problem with their email system.) i did get an email acknowledgement confirming the order# - though no indication of shipment status.
