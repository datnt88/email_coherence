a non-wifi tablet will cost $$$$$$$$$$. 
laptop magazine listed subsidized 3g/4g tablets in the top 10 charges you'd be an idiot to pay. 
they took a galaxy tab from verizon selling for 429 with a 2 year contract (which is 30 a month). 
they calculated that 949 over the life of the contract and the wifi version is 448. 
i suggest a wifi tablet and use your phone for gps. 
now if you don't have a smartphone thats a different story. 
i know my phone gps helped me in pittsburgh when the cd in the dashboard gps failed.
