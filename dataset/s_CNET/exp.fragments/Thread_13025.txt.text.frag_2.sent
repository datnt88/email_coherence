changing the pcb rarely works. 
here's why. 
not only must you match the make/model, but the firmware version and pcb revision levels. 
many will not find a working drive to steal the pcb from. 
they'll get another dead drive and hope it works. 
companies like drivesavers and ontrack (dot com) offer data salvation services every day.
