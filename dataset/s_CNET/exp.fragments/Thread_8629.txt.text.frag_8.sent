i plan on reformating the drive as ntfs, the problem is that i need to transfer the data temporarily to another drive, and the other external drive looks like it is failing, so i am just going to buy another external hd and use that as a dual backup. 
also people on this forum have convinced me that backing up to a dvd is also a good idea.
