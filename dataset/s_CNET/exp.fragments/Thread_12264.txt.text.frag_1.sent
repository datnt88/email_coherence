attempting to convert an mpg file to avi in order to burn it to dvd....get an error message i've never seen before and haven't got a clue about what it wants me to do. 
can anybody help? 
error message: connect video stream to tee filter it's a file on my harddrive and not being streamed via the pc so i'm clueless. 
attempting to just burn it straight as mpg to dvd isn't working, and i have all the correct codecs installed as far as i know.
