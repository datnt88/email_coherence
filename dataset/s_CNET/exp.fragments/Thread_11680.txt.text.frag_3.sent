you could have also set the autoplay/autorun feature to run when usb is plugged-in, what pgm. to run. 
to change/disable that or make at least ask again, try: once done and disabled, it won't autorun. 
however, you still need to close the pop-up, do that and then the plugged-in device will be available. 
if for some reason you want to act upon certain type files(association) then whenever those files are part of the autorun mode, this is what i believe what has happened in your case, imho. 
now that autorun is disabled, no pgm. 
will autostart again, unless you change it as it will always ask during that pop-up.
