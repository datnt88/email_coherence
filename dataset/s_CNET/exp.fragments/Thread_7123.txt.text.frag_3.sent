buy an under $100 mono laser and be done with it. the big plus if you truly do occasional printing, it'll be ready to go and the toner cart. 
will last as well for a very long time. 
buy any cheap inkjet printer then expect cheap results over time and any refills you're at the mercy of the source of those refills, false economy.
