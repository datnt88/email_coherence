that's a little clearer. 
here's what i see happen daily. 
people format a drive and install &quot;windows&quot;. 
what they didn't know is that drivers for the motherboard, usb and other items are not installed for them or don't exist on the microsoft cd. it's become a bad problem in that years ago we were expected to know this. 
today, newer owners are handed working machines and not instructed on how to install an os. bob
