i had to reformat my entire hard drive when i downloaded a rogue program that screwed up my registry. 
i had no access to my optical drives, even external usb ones! 
i eventually had to reinstall my xp os. i didn't have anything important on it anyway since it was only my desktop that i used for gaming. 
i've had no computer problems since.
