you won't save much money by building your own, reason being builders like dell get their parts in huge quantities much cheaper than you will be able to buy them. 
building your own is fun and you get exactly what you want. 
keep in mind, the most expensive parts of any computer are the processor and the ram. 
suggest for your first build, you buy a so-called &quot;bare bones&quot; system from any number of online suppliers. 
they get the same big discounts as dell so you are not disadvantaged going this route. 
you'll get the case/powersupply/fans/motherboard/processor/heatsink, all compatible and all assembled and tested. 
your old ram won't work so you should probably buy your ram from the barebones supplier. 
do the research and compare bare bones packages terms of cost and processor speed, get the best motherboard money can buy (they're cheap)and then add video/audio/modems etc. depending on which on board features you have on the motherboard. 
add drives of your choice and you're done. 
for an operating system, suggest buy and oem version of windows xp for about $100.
