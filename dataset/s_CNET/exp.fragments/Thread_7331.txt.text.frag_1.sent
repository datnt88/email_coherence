i recently bought a usb3 portable hdd. 
case. 
from my unscientific observation, it seem to me it is as fast as my esata hdd...it might even be slightly faster. 
i transferred 3.8gb video as a test and it took about 3 minutes, and my esata takes about 4 minutes. 
oh the usb3 case is connected to the usb2 port of the computer only. 
i didn't have a usb3 port to connect it to (another story for later).
