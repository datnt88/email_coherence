i have an epson workforce 630. 
i am using it to temporarily replace our main office copier/fax machine until its repaired. 
initially i could not send or receive faxes, but then i was instructed to turn off error correcting mode (ecm) and turn off v.3.4. 
after i did this i was able to receive faxes and i was able to send a test fax to epson which they received, but when i try to fax to other numbers it does not go through. 
any ideas as to why this might happen?
