i have just successfully used logmein hamachi to setup a vvpn (not sure if that is a new acronym, but it works) virtual, virtual private network. 
instead of using a vpn box where i had to configure it past the firewalls at each office, i just installed the free version of hamachi from logmein. it worked like a champ. 
even if you use the paid version, which is 32 connections, its only $19.00 a year. 
i connected two offices shared drives. 
one in dallas one in florida, mapped the drives on each pc and it worked like a champ. 
very easy to setup, anyone can do it, it uses port 80 and 443, so its no problem getting past firewalls. 
norton gave me trouble on one pc, but i just added it to the exception list. 
i was very impressed at how well it worked and even more impressed with the price.
