1. some, yes, some, no. when i got my 160gb hdd i formatted it to ntfs first just to be sure that it was in ntfs. 
it will take a while (that took me about 2 hours) and more for larger drives. 
2. if you don't plug it in when the attack takes place, it is safe. 
but the next time you connect it, some trojans or viruses may attept to enter the hard drive. 
the best solution is to back up your data at least weekly, if not daily. 
3. yep, you can use the hdds on both windows and mac to exchange data.
