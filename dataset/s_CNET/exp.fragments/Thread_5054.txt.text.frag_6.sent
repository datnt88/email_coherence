i had tested my ram with memtest and also installed and checked them individually...came out with no errors some 8-9 months ago i had replaced my previous card 8400 gs...then they had applied the compound on the heat sink and also updated the bios should i do that again? 
i mean checking the thermal grease and updating the bios?
