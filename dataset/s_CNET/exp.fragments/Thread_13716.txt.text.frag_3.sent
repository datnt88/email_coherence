your wireless connection on the router? 
if the laptop will access the router you're done. 
mine works perfectly. 
did the router come with any instructions? 
have you installed it properly? 
have you contacted linksys? 
but do not attempt any router maintenance wireless, use the cord. 
set everything up wired, then unplug and go wireless.
