apparently whatever you are connecting to the powered usb port [it the powered port is mandatory], is something that draws considerable current from ther 5 volts. 
if you connected the device to the powered hub, but did not have the hub power adapter plugged in, the device may have drawn too much current from the 5 volt usb connection within the computer. 
this may have caused the computer shutdown. 
the amount of current required for the device certainly shouldn't be too much for the main 5 volts from the power supply, however, the computer's usb circuits may have built in protection to prevent getting burned out by overload. 
[of course, it is possible that the device has failed and is shorted] this is simply a wag, because i see that no else has answered for quite a while, although on summer weekend days many people that normally reply are enjoying something else. 
i am not absolutely sure what device was being connected. 
possibly a little more precise explanation of what you were doing step by step would clarify it further. 
good luck.
