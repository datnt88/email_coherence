so i can't know if they hid the drivers like they often do. 
and it appears you missed a nugget. 
here it is again. 
driver install order matters. 
again, motherboard drivers may need to be installed before a video driver. 
this is true for almost any system i've encountered. 
more? 
sure. 
i find a lot of folk lose months over this. 
after a few years of this my best advice is to use the recovery media for this laptop.
