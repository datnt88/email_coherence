i have tried installing the setup software and it stalls/hangs at the point where it detects the drive. 
an unlock dialog box never appears, it just sits at the dialog box that detects the drive. the drive shows up in device manager correctly but does not appear in my computer and i can hear the drive whirring but again no password dialog box appears. 
i suspect this may be because the setup software was not designed for a locked drive as the drive ships in an unlocked state. 
that is why i was wondering if there is some way to get the lock/unlock software separate from the setup software. 
my other alternative is to find someone with a maxtor drive that has the software already installed and trying to unlock the drive using their computer.
