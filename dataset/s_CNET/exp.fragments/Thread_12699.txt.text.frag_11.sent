thanks for your advice. 
i'm getting a new toast 6 lite cd and a 6/6 pin fw cable to see if that does the job. 
to be honest, having never found problems with usb before, i thought it was usb2, hadn't heard about usb1 until more recently.....learning curve ! 
i've only ever used fw for downloading video from a camcorder, with no probs. 
when i have the 6/6 firewire cable and cd, i'll post my results. 
thanks.
