now that you used that to get items such as &quot;module voltage-sstl 1.8v&quot; did you check the maker's web site to see if that matched then head to the bios to see if you set the bios to match? 
build your own pcs have taken a turn to more complexity as i find build after build with incorrect bios settings. 
people seem to think this is automagic.
