okay, your limitations make the list rather narrow to look at. the hardest two features are the networking and the size. 
now if you have a print server that you can attach to the printer that will make things easier. 
they run around 30-60 dollars on the web (i think, haven't looked in a while). 
now while lexmark does have some printers that have networking functions, i do not recommend lexmark due to the cost of ink and quality of printouts and the quality of the printer. 
some to look at canon pixma mp610 canon pixma mp600 hp photosmart c6280 (has all the features you want) i would go to the c6280 if i was you
