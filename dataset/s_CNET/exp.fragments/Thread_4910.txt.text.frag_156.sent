i am a pc repair technician with a major retailer in south texas. 
recently i had to work on a gateway gt5628 that was having similar problems to the ones you all have discussed in this thread. the processor fan would start running very fast, then the computer would turn itself off. 
i have resolved this problem, and i know what caused it. the gateway gt series uses a modified intel desktop board. 
the board itself is made by intel, gateway merely puts their own limited (and flawed, in my opinion) bios on the board. 
the board that was in this faulty gt series pc was the dg33sxg2. 
i replaced it with a dg33sl desktop board, which is almost exactly identical to the dg33sxg2. 
after making a minor adjustment to switch the sata mode to raid, the pc booted right up to a vista desktop, readjusted its hardware resource database, and proceeded to work perfectly. 
the cost of the new motherboard (retail) was $130.00. 
you can probably find it cheaper on the web from many sources. the only practical difference between the two boards, aside from one having ps2 ports and one not...was their bios. the intel dg33tl of course had intel bios. the gateway board had a proprietary, stripped down &quot;gateway&quot; version of those bios. 
i am concluding that the entire problem with the gt series is nothing more than bad bios programming on gateway's part. 
or perhaps it was done intentionally, a &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; marketing tactic. 
make the boards bomb after a year, when they are out of warranty, and force the customer to buy a new board or a new pc. 
you be the judge.
