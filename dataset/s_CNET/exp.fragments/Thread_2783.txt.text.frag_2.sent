you would need either a router designed with that capability or a compatible adapter kit that can provide the dc input your router needs. 
baring that, you get creative and fashion your own. 
you need to add the dc from some area near your modem. the device used is called an &quot;injector&quot;. you then need to split the data and power signals at the router. 
typically injectors produce dc at a higher voltage than that which is required for the device they power. 
this is the hangup you'll run into. 
if your router gets 6v from it's external ps and your injector produces the typical 48v, you may fry something. 
have you checked to see what the dc requirements are of your router and if a kit is available to match? 
while i've no real experience with such fabrications, i do suspect there is a reason for poe to need the higher voltage and that is to ensure delivery of enough current over longer distances such as one encounters over longer wiring runs.
