&quot;it looks like photoshop express is the only thing compatible with windows 8 pro&quot; windows 8 pro can run the same photoshop as you do on laptops and desktops. 
this is the surest way to assure that you get everything you asked for. 
ms office is available and since it's windows 8 pro, you should be able to run windows office 2003 to today's current version as well as the free libreoffice. 
can you define document sharing? 
here i just put my docs and such on dropbox and can access them on all my machines. 
to me that's document sharing.
