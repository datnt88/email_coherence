hp mini 210-2072cl 32bit 1.66 ghz 2 gig ram. 
recently while on a newspaper discussion thread commenting on a post the group of keys to the right stopped working. 
that will be the p,0,-,/,&quot;, keys and maybe a couple more. 
i did a system restore and they started working fine until once again while i was online they just suddenly stopped working again. 
if i play with several at the same time the keys come back. 
weird. 
so i bought a wireless ps/2 in order to type without the worry but that defeats the purpose of having a netbook when i have to haul the ps/2 around. 
i was wondering if this problem was a software issue, a keyboard issue or a virus type problem. 
could i have picked up something on the internet or from one of the newspaper discussion threads? 
browser - firefox w/private mode and session only cookies on the exceptions list. 
clear cache on exit. 
ms windows defender. 
i'm ready to buy another laptop but rather not spend the money if i could fix this problem. 
anyone know of this keyboard issue? 
what to do? 
your advice is well appreciated - thanks!!
