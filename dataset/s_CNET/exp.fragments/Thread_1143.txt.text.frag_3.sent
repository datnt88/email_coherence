thanks for your reply kees. 
i will never have more than 2 or 3 computers on the network. 
i have got all the ethernet runs in order to connect televisions in different rooms etc, giving them access to my nas media. 
there will not be a lot of traffic on the network, usually only 1 or 2 devices at a time. 
i need a setup that is more for the home user. 
i am hoping to spend about $400 or so on my switch. 
would i be better to have a standard 24 port gigabit switch, and use poe adaptors? 
thanks barry
