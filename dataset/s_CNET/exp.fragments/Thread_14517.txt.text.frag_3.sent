the xp drive management whatever you said probably won't help since xp won't install. 
i believe the problem is that a raid driver needs to be installed from a supplied cd, but the computer in question has only one cd drive. 
when the xp cd is taken out, it won't continue with installation, even to install the drivers from the supplied cd. it looks like another cd drive is going to be in order.
