both the time when i had to format my computer it was the same old problem. 
a virus infecting the pc. first time i did not have an antivirus but the next time i had mcafee installed but it wasn't updated , so it was a new virus this time and i was left with nothing but to format because i only had old software with me that time and i also live in a remote area so, i don't have access to all this software stuff. 
but now i have access to internet and i also have subscribed to a magazine that provides you with new stuff and softwares. 
so, life's good for now!
