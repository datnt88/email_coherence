i've been researching network hardwear for three days and can't find a highly rated pci adapter. the linksys wrt54g router is high up there, but the wmp54g pci adapter has been having problems. 
looked at a usr 5416 it lacks wap, anyone have any ideas on a good combination for a router and pci adapter
