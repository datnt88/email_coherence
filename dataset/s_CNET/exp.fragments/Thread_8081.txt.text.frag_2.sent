ok i figured out something. 
since i have an nvidia video card and the latest drivers, i was able to create a custom resolution of 1280x800 so webpages and text is much easier to read. the directions are here... but you have to use the classic nvidia control panel to do it. 
here are some standard aspect ratios for 16:10 computer monitors... 2560x1600 1920x1200 1680x1050 1440x900 1280x800 1024x640 800x500
