as mentioned, you'll need to use recovery software. 
here's an article describing the software with reviews and links to freeware recovery software available on this site: now the smartmedia card was, if i'm not mistaken, the first flash card. 
also if i remember correctly, these cards were not really designed to be durable and last forever (few years max). 
i'm surprised yours was still working properly. 
would highly recommend considering a new camera with new media.
