i just decided &quot;what the heck&quot; and bought the 8800 gts. 
my question is about my processor. 
i am confident with my other system specs, so they are not important. 
but currently i have an amd 64 3200+. is it stupid of me to spend that much money on an 8800 gts when i have this processor? 
i dont want the card to run slower because of my processing power. 
so what should i do? 
spend the money to upgrade to a dual core processor? 
or should a game like crysis use the card fully with the processor i have now? 
also, if i was to upgrade, what is a recommended processor that wouldnt bottleneck the 8800 gts? 
any helpful suggestions are welcome..
