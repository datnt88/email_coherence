this morning when i turned on my old desktop computer, my acer lcd monitor was displayed nothing. the only thing i can see is the light on the bottom of the lcd keep flashing. 
normally, last time when i pushed the power button i can see the acer logo appeared on the lcd screen but now no more acer logo appear, it just no response. 
my pc can post with a single beep sound and i can heard the melody when my computer enter windows. 
what happen to my computer? 
thanks
