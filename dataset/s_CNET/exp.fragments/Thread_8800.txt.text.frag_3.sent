comes with a utility cd which includes the drivers. 
i would (a) see that the usb connectors are properly attached to the motherboard (check the manual schematic) and get the utility cd from the vendor. 
one other thing is you might check driverguide.com and other sites to locate the drivers remember usb 2.0 not supported until xp sp2
