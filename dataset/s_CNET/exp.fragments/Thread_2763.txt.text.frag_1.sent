i am looking to purchase a new printer and am unsure as to whether i need a network ready printer or a wireless printer. 
i have an older desktop connected in my kids room which is connected to a wireless router and then to the dsl port in the wall. 
i also have a dell laptop which i use wirelessly in a separate office room. 
i want to be able to print from both computers, but i want to set the printer up in my office not next to the desktop with the router. the way i understand what i have read so far is that a network ready printer would actually need to be wired to the router, and a wireless printer would not, but would pick up the signal from the router. 
in either case it seems i would be able to print wirelessly from the laptop. 
but if i buy a wireless printer, would i be able to print from the desktop to the wireless printer if it is set up in another room? 
i hope i explained this clearly enough....
