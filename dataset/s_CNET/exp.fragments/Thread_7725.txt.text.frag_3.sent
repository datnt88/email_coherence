given that your not doing any sort of graphics the purchase of 128mb boards will chew up between $40-$250 depending on the boards you select which is $40-$250 better spent elsewhere since your doing mass multi-tasking and the like i would suggest a machine of the following set-up, and it will cost around the same as his suggestion, if not a little more, but it would get the job done (i always start the most expensive position, and work my way down, most people start the ground and build up) cpu - pentium 4 3.2ghz with em64t (it's an lga 775 chip, 630 i believe) ram - 1gb dual channel ddr2 (idk what speed is correct, i think ddr2 533 is though, or ddr2 400) hdd - ^ avliable in ata-133 for about $30 less, the only difference between ata-133 and sata (at this point) is that everyone will say to get sata due to it's &quot;future proof ness&quot; and higher data transfer rates it's 133mb/s vs 150mb/s same cache and same rpm/drive your not gonna notice much...maybe a .5% performance decrease as for a monitor i'd suggest a 17&quot; lcd or a 19&quot; crt (a 19&quot; lcd is comparable to a 21&quot; crt) and given your desired job, i'd personally get a high end viewsonic 19&quot; crt, and run that refresh rate at over 80hz (lcd's strain my eyes, like, me personally, but for you it might be different (just goto the local store, and see which you prefer, lcd or crt) also, i would suggest including some form of decent-ish 2.1 or 2.0 speakers as long hours of work are passed easier with music newegg just realeased these for sale i would strongly consider them while they will cost much more and take a bit more to cool/power it will provide a better multi-tasking set-up in addition, for gfx i'd go with intel's gma 900 it's more than enough for your needs
