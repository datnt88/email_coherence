ok, here's my problem, i think this is a sign but i don't know. 
my internet connection is not working as fast as it used to, and my other computer is a pc and it's working just fine, i feel like it is the wireless card in my laptop, because it connects ok, but when i hit internet explorer or mozilla it lags and is very slow, any suggestions on how to fix this, or any updates i should know about, here are my system specs: dell inspiron 6000 2.0 gb ram 50 gb hd space intel(r) proset/wireless card, windows version 9.0.4.33 windows xp media center edition
