you need to download the firmware from netgear and save it someplace like c:temp wnr834b_fw1035.img is the actual file name that i downloaded from netgear. 
1. change your pcs ip address to 192.168.1.10, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.1.1, preferred dns 192.168.1.1 2. from the command prompt ''cdtemp'' then from c:temp&gt; type ''tftp -i 192.168.1.1 put wnr834b_fw1035.img'' the netgear documentation states it will take 3 minutes but just wait for the lights to look normal. 
if it takes 3 minutes it is beyond fried. 
3. if it works, change your pcs ip settings back to obtain. 
i hope this helps.
