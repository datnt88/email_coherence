hey, i was wondering if there is any possible configuration for a powerline adapter to be connected to a router (that is connected to a modem) at one end, and be connected to another router (ethernet line connecting to the &quot;internet&quot; port) in a different part of the house at the other end. 
so basically is it possible to &quot;broadcast&quot; the internet on the base router to another router via powerline adapters? 
i tried this experiment and it showed up another ssid (&quot;default&quot;), with excellent connection but it wouldn't connect successfully. 
or could it be that the router is a little outdated? 
my base router is a just-released wireless-n linksys, and the one i am trying to use in a different part is a (3-year outdated) d-link b/g router. 
thanks a lot in advance!
