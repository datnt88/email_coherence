i don't have that specific option but i set the ''my documents'' folder to allow sharing by other computers on the network and it still doesn't work. 
thanks..any other ideas? 
i can ping each computer using the ip addreses assigned to each computer by my router and i can see the other computer's shared files in my network group but when i go to open them i get a message stating ''access denied, i don't have permission to access those files'' my computer doesn't seem to recognize me at the administrator when i go into the computer management section and try to share from there. 
i am the only one on this computer and when it starts up and i check the ''users'' section i am designated at the administrator...
