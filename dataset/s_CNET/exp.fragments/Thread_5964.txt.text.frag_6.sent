i'm having the same problem with my hp pavillion f1703 lcd. 
it'll go dim for a second, the go black. the power button seems faint, but still lit. 
i can have the pc off all night, turn it on in the morning, and it still doesn't work. 
turn it off, run some errands, turn it on, works for hours before it goes out. 
for some reason i was thinking it was a power issue, but not sure. 
i bought a used crt today and it's working fine. 
it's the size of my car, but it works great.
