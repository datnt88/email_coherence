most linksys devices use reverse polarity sma (rpsma). 
other possible connections are tnc and &quot;n-type&quot;. the picture looks like rpsma but it is hard to tell. 
if you are lucky the antenna is male and the ap is female. 
if this is the case, you can connect directly or you buy an extension cable. 
every cable and connection adds some loss.
