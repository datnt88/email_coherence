hi bob, just briefly: i don't like laptops, and do like pcs with the separate keyboard, big screen, mouse, etc. tell me more about win 7. in a brief search for reviews, there are a few beta reviews, but nothing really too substantial yet. 
do you think it will be (a) as good as, or better than, xp; and/or (b) fix all the bugs / better than vista? 
thanks for any info.
