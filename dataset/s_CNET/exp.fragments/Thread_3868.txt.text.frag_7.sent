&quot;if original holographed windows xp cd won't install, it's a hardware issue.&quot; 
yep, that's true. 
nothing in your post reveals what could be busted here. 
it could be bad anything to issues like someone trying to format a drive ahead of time to too much ram for the xp in question. 
or simply trying to use a dell, hp, gateway xp cd. bob
