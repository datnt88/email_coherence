i've tried refills and also staples cartridges for my two hp printers. 
neither worked at all! the re-fill attempt was several years ago and i can't explain why it wouldn't work. 
(maybe hp has some super chemical sensor that detected alien ink?) with the staples ink cartridge on my 3 year old multifunction printer, the mechanism for moving the cartridge just wouldn't go. 
i was afraid it broke, but when i replaced the cartridge with the hp brand, it worked fine again.
