i saw this at fry's on today paper. 
it's call &quot;vga video splitter&quot; with 4 ports up to 1920x1440 resolution and it's made by iogear. 
$45 with $10 instant saving. 
i did see another devices for such purpose but i forgot the name or where i have seen it. 
so it's out there. 
this one could be use as clone or display extension.
