i believe the computer that you have is shipped with a sata connector for your hdd and that the optical drives (dvdrom/cdrom) are actually attached to an ide connector using an ide cable usually a flat and gray cable, the other one or the middle socket of such cable (usually for the slave) should not be in use, so that you could use/attach the old hdd. 
anyway, it's just a matter of connection availability. 
can i have the specs of this xps? is that from dell? 
i believe it has an ide connector native to the mobo. 
goodluck.
