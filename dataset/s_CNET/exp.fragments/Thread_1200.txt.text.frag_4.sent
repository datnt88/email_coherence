i was thinking of installing linux on the second hard drive. 
i currently have windows 2000 server. 
haven't gotten around to upgrading that since i don't upgrade unless i am forced to upgrade. 
i built the pc myself. 
i'll need to post the specs when i get home since i don't know off the top of my head.
