grouch??? well maybe old and crusty. 
i recall a thread on the old boards where he was a &quot;diseased rat&quot; that was a hoot. 
maybe someday when i get to the knowledge level of the d-rat i'll want a post to contain all the questions/facts/pieces etc. so that i get the complete picture instead of having to play 20-questions. 
for now, i find a post with multiple questions and multiple answers to multiple questions rather difficult to follow. 
however i'm looking at this from the receiving end and not the giving end.
