thats the problem. 
im not getting this screen anymore. 
i've actually done this before when i was using a different monitor, and used the &quot;computer wasn't shut down properly&quot; screen to boot into safe mode and change it back. 
this time though i don't get that screen. 
do you think i might have done something to the graphics card? 
could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?
