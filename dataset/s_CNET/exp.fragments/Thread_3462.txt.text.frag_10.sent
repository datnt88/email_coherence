i thought your mn-510 is a wireless-b adapter? 
you are supposed to use it to connect to some type of wireless access point. 
therefore, you need to use the &quot;network setup wizard&quot; and not &quot;create a new connection.&quot; 
what is your setup? 
do you have a wireless router? 
if you need help in finding it, just type &quot;network setup wizard&quot; into help and support.
