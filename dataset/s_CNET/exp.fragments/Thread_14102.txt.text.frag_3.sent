thanks for the quick reply.. it isn't that old,, about 3 years i tried using wd diagnostics.. after couple of times freezing, it completed the scan progress &gt;&gt; result: no errors or bad sectors chkdsk also has completed the scan (finally).. saying that there were errors fixed i tried to boot but this time.. it doesn't reach windows logo.. it shows an error message (( error in the file system windows/system/... ))
