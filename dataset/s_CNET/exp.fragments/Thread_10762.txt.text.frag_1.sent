hi, i am trying to install an old hard drive into my pc and every time i do the computer acts funny, it caused the battery in the motherboard to fail, and it stops other hard drives from working. 
but when i uninstall it the computer returns to normal. 
this hard drive has data on it that belongs to my dad, so i want to return it to him, but don't want to cause serious damage to his pc. the drive was put into an enclosure a while back, but it got damaged. 
what i have tried i have changed the jumper settings to &quot;cable select&quot; which stopped the drive from interfering with my hard drive. 
but this caused the battery on the motherboard to fail. 
i tried changing the jumpers to &quot;slave&quot; but the same issue continued. 
the hard drive is a pata drive, and the details for the drive are as follows: manufacturer: excelstor model: t880 i found details on the manufacturers website which advised on how to change the settings to the above stated. 
as my dad wants the drive back and i can't currently afford a new enclosure i'm hoping someone can give me some advice on what to try. an important thing i forgot to mention is the drive had been installed in my old pc of which my dad now owns, the drive was set as master but it wasn't set to boot as it's just for storage not for the operating system.
