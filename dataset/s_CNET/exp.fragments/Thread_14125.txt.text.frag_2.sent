the builder may have very well sent you a working pc provided you &quot;added&quot; those ext. 
usb devices when it arrived, etc.. that is an added burden but it should have worked. 
your comment on the siig soundcard does provide a clue if still connected. 
remove it, if so at least during the testing. 
if your biostar mtrbd. 
has audio on-board disable it via the bios setting. 
you do have a better psu but!!! you remained with 500w unit. 
you should have upped the ante and gotten more due to your past problems. 
let's be clear, better pcs now have 700w psus or better maybe a 650w or similar. the point being you don't want to stress the psu to its upper tolerances even a good one. 
i suggest you use the rear usb ports. 
if the ext. 
usb devices are powered by usb port, find a powered ext. 
usb hub. 
just how many usb devices are attached, don'e exclude any mouse, etc.. the whole usb list. is the video card cooled by fan or totally quiet type with heatsink only? 
have you applied any bios updates? 
place a household fan to open case and try to run it? 
goto intel and check for any sandy bridge issues, yours maybe an older cpu even if i5 type.
