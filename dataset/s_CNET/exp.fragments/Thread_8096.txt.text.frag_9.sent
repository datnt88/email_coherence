chris: i reseated the memory and it seems to have done the trick. 
however, when i opened the computer, i discovered i only have two sticks of memory, each of which is located in the white tabs. 
i thought, based on the links you sent me, that the memory would be in the black tabs, if anywhere. 
i haven't added memory to it before, so i guess two sticks is the default for the xps? 
my question is, if i buy two more memory sticks and seat them in the black tabs, will it make much of a difference in the computer's performance? 
i don't have a lot on it, aside from music files, and it seems to be working well now. 
but if additional memory will make it faster, i'm all for it. 
what do you think? 
thanks again for the reseating suggestion - it saved me some money. 
i appreciate it.
