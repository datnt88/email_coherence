i guess the only thing we can go by is our own experience. 
my experience has been fine with my dell. 
i had a gateway and it was your worse nightmare. 
after the first month i had a rebuilt computer. 
everything went out, speakers, mother board (2 not the first month), power pack. 
finally bought a new one that i had built from a local dealer. 
nightmare again so i paid a restocking fee 3 weeks later for him to take it back. 
i gave him my old pc plus his charges to fix the computer so i decided to count my losses. 
then i ordered a dell in fear and trimbeling. 
thank goodness i lucked out as far as it is still working and i have had it since dec. 
13, 2004. the only reason i ordered a dell is because i knew a lot of people who had one and seemed pleased. 
anyway glad to hear when people have pleasant experiences with their computers no matter where they purchase one. 
if i was a teck i would build my own and fix it.
