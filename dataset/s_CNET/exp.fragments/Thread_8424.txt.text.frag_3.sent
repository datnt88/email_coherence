thanks for the info. 
i figured that prices here were more quite high compared to back in the u.s., but i guess there's no way around that. it looks like that gateway pc doesn't come with a monitor. 
according to the same website, monitors look to be about $300 and up so i guess that takes a little bite out of the price difference. 
couldn't tell from the page, but does that pc include dvd-ram as well? 
and, did it have tv capability? 
thanks again for the link.
