i have a very good question that needs answering.. can i use my 'wd mybook 500gb' or any other external hardrive to listen to music/view media on a regular basis? 
in other words, can i use my external hardrive just like any other hardrive? 
the reason for this type of question is that i feel a little uneasy about seeing how hard my hardrive has to work.. or how it heats up after long periods of time. 
it's enough to get anyone a little concerned.
