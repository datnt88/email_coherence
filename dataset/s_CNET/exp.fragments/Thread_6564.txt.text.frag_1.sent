hi. i've a sony dru-530a dvd burner(with recently upgrade firmware 2.1c) on a dell dimension 4550. 
i've 640 in ram and the processor runs at 2.53mghz. 
well, the problem is that i've ripped some dvd movies, and then copied then on dvd -r media, i've tried(memorex, tdk and verbatim), and when i finish, they all play well on the computer dvd, but when i put them on my sony dvd player in the living room, i get some still screens and some skips. 
all of them are like that, and i've tried in different dvd player that support the dvd -r/+r and so forth. 
i've use cyberlink dvdcopy, dvd shrink, nero burning room. 
i've burn at different speeds also, and i got the same problem. 
i've disable any background program while burning, and leave the computer alone to do its job, but it is the same. 
i go see the movie, it plays really well, but then some scenes in the movie get still for seconds or skip. 
i would love help, since i don't know what to do. 
i just feel like throwing my dvd burner to the garbage. 
thanks.
