do i have to defrag the raid? 
and if so do i need a special program for it or just use anything? 
(i prefer ultimate defrag) obviously i have no experience at all with raid's, as i said in the original post the only time i've made a raid is on a mac and that was as simple as &quot;click and drag the hard drives you want to be in the raid to this box.&quot; and i was done. 
lol. 
i just don't want this to be like when i bought a video card completely clueless and ended up with a &quot;cheap&quot; $120 card.
