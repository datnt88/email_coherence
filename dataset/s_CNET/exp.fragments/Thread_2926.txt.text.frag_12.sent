while creative labs did put midi on the db15 of the sb16 card, no game controls are in play here. 
you'll confuse those less in the know by asking for a game port for your pc. and we can't talk about adding the sb16 since, and i may have missed it where you told all about your pc. to get this put to rest, you have to tell at least what the words in red ask when you post. 
--&gt; also, why not use the old machine since the software is not known to run on today's machines.
