since this would be the first webcam i'm getting obviously i haven't any experience with them. 
i'm not panning your lighting tips though. 
sorry if you got that impression. 
what i was getting at though, was you said that the camera i saw was no different from the ones you owned. 
so i'm asking, what would be different? 
thanks for the link. 
unfortunately, i am at work now so i can't view youtube links. 
but i will check it out at home.
