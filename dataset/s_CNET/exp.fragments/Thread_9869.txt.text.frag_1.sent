hello, i just wired each room with 3 cat5e cables (2 for internet and the other cat5e cable to wire 2 telephone lines), 2 rg6 cables. 
all this wire terminates in one location in the basement where i am going to make all my connections. 
i thought i would wire all my cat5e connections to a patch panel, but that does not seems to be all that i need to make all the connections work. 
do i need a switch? 
i take my connection out of the modem an run it into the switch? 
managed/unmanaged switch...i assume unmannaged. 
i will be connection to comcast internet...something else i need? 
for cable, i just run my source signal into a splitter and then make all my connections to the other end of the splitter? 
something else i should consider?
