but you'll wind up with a pc that has exactly what you want and has better expandibility. 
that $500 walmart pc probably doesn't have a graphics slot or has a dinky power supply that couldn't handle a decent graphics card. the ram is probably slow and split between 2 slots so you'll probably be better off just tossing it if you add more memory. 
your car analogy is bang on. 
just be aware that you can't build a pc that's cheaper than the $500 special. 
but you can build one that's faster/better than the $1000 system for about the same price.
