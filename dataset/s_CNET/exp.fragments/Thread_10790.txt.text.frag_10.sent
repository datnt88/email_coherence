well, it's a few months later and the screen has all but healed itself. 
the larger (and remaining) of the two dots has recently disappeared, after growing and shrinking for a few weeks, so the only fault left with the screen is a small bit on the extreme upper right corner. 
still not happy with having to wait over a month, uncounted calls and more than a few hours on hold, being transferred, etc. with sony's customer 'service' team, but at least my screen is almost back to it's beautiful self, and without having to pay the extortionate can $1,700+ they wanted to replace it. 
am still too afraid to travel with this thing given how fragile it turned out to be, but at least now i have a beautiful desktop, albeit in laptop form. 
thanks to those who offered their insights. 
hope my problem and 'solution' is of help to others.
