i just read that wd recently came out with a single platter sata3 160 hdd with 16mb cache (last october 06?). it's supposed to be the fastest and coolest hd out there, which may be ideal since i don't expect to go over 20g with os & programs (that leaves alot of room for the unexpected). 
this 160 is supposed to have the same density as the larger hdds since the 250 & 320 use 2 platters (the 250 doesn't use the max density but the 320 does 160x2), the 400 & 500 use 3 platters and the 750 uses 4 platters. 
i definitely agree that an older smaller drive will be much slower than a large new drive, but this may address both sides of the arguement...am i overlooking anything?
