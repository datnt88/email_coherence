my 2-year-old logitech optical wheel mouse (m-bj58) seems to be less responsive for the past week. 
it will be working fine, then it will become lazy and barely follow my movements. 
is there any maintenance i can perform to bring its performance back to standard, or must i buy a new mouse? 
if so, which would you recommend for a: hp pavilion pentium 4 cpu, 2 ghrtz, 512 ram running winxp home, service pack 1?
