many members would be happy to help i would look at this video guide: if that looks like its for you, then i would suggest building your own if not, then i would suggest looking at dell or hewlett-packard/compaq (or maybe apple, if you have no qualms about that (apple would handle what you've described just fine, but os x isn't for everyone)) generally, the bottom shelf systems from dell (as i recall its still a dual core athlon64 x2 3600+, with something to the tune of 512mb or 1gb of ram, and a hard-drive in the multi-hundred (i wanna say 250) gigabyte range with integrated graphics, all for about $399-$499 with some sort of monitor included (or offered at a discount)) will handle your described workload flawlessly if you are interested in building you own, look at (also a good place to find acer computers) and for parts
