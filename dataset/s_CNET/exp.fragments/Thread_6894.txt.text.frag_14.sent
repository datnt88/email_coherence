but the form factor of the memory stick, if we change that would require new sockets and yet another connection/board standard. 
since we can use, for example, the ddr2 stick profile and make a cheaper stick for most but all machines we would do that. the few with the amd k8 may want to use the cheaper stick but find it incompatible. 
this is why the same stick profiles are used. 
as to fpgas, those are not &quot;ram.&quot;
