...doesn't require a modern 20pin + 4pin power supply. 
with one of these older boards you simply plug in the normal 20pin plug and shove the the 4 pin plug out of the way, and forget about it for years! 
there is of course a method to test your psu (and it's the best way to test a water cooled rig safely for leaks too) safely, but first unplug all devices such as motherboard, drives, cd-rom etc. then go to this url : be very carefull, and double check which two pins you are connecting, before powering up the psu!!!! we await results... good luck, geebee.
