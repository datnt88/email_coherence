a damaaged boot sector can be fixed with a reformat, but if the diagnostics say the drive is bad they are detecting a hardware issue and the drive is close to toast. 
here's a cheap sata-to-ide adapter: no drivers will be necessary. 
if the pc has usb, consider this case: if you want a controller, here's another inexpensive choice but you'll have to install drivers. 
as for newegg's customer reviews, you'll find many folks complaining because they didn't know what they were getting. 
&quot;it won't work with my 1tb drive; the drivers are buggy; it won't work with this drive, it's slow&quot; etc. adding new tech to an old pc can be a challenge.
