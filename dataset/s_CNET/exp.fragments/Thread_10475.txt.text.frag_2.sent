if i find a dvd drive that shows a drive letter, but can't read any disks, then i save people time and money by trying a known working drive. 
try a known working drive. 
oh! you want to test this drive? 
here's the test. 
try to boot from said drive. 
if it can't boot a cd, then it's 99.99% likely to be dead.
