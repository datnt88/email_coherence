well, as i've said, i can easily back it up - i just need to copy the files over to c. that's a backup, yes? 
i don't want/need to reformat c, it's ntfs already. 
so really i'm not taking any risks. 
i'll certainly make a backup before messing around with my external. 
ok? thankyou for your advice. 
you are right about my irresponsibility regarding the drive.
