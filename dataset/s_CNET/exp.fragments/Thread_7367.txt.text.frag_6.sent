the card seats fine, as i've inserted it 3 different times. 
yes, i'm using the same monitor. 
i will look around for a dvi cable. the old machine, where it worked, is now in use at my son-in-law's house. 
no other extra vga card on hand. 
but one way or another, i'll dig up a piece of hardware so i can prove whether the card is bad or not. 
i still have mfg. 
warranty time. 
thanks for your suggestions. 
my biggest concern was that it was something i wasn't doing right.
