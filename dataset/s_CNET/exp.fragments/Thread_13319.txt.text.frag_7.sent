emulator, how would that effect the performance of os x? if apple do not put intels into the existing power mac cases in january 2006, are you advocating that everyone wait until they do? 
as i said earlier, not everyone wants windows and intel do not have anything that touches the quad g5, right now. 
in the future they certainly will do but that will not make the pm g5 unusable. 
for the average mac buyer, not the switcher, the fact that a mac can run windows is moot. 
their main concern is how well does it run os x. that would be the only thing that i would be concerned with. 
if i need a new mac now, and are not concerned whether it runs windows or not, how long should i wait before intel produce something comparable to the quad g5 and apple put it into a machine? 
of course, intel may have some secret processor that they have not mentioned but i think that apple will wait until the change to intel, on the pm range, does not mean a performance drop.
