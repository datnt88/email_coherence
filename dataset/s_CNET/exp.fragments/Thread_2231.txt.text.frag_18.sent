i use wqxga, that is 2560x1600 on 30&quot; dell monitor. 
such displays are expensive but the compfort of work is extreme, especially if you are a professional designer, programmer or you worh with many open windows. 
i'm really unhappy if i'm forced to work on a smaller display or lower resolution.
