i have a samsung 19 inch led flat panel monitor. 
model 940bw, model code: ls19hawkby/xaa, sn # ha19htap110095b. 
when i start up my pc, the monitor will flash what is on the screen and then go blank (black). 
if i shut the monitor off and turn it back on it'll flash again and go blank. 
i know it's the monitor with the problem because i hooked it up to another computer and it does the same thing. 
i've checked the connections on the cord and everything seems tight. 
i even reversed the cord (unplugged it from the monitor and plugged it into the pc). 
can you tell me if this can be fixed or should i trash it? 
it's only a couple years old. 
i thought it would last longer than this.
