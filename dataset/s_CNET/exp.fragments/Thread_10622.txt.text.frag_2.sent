when you go to any website, the lights will blink on the router, this is normal. 
second thing, the wireless router you have, go to their website and download and install the latest firmware. 
most routers come with out dated firmware. the latest firmware helps to keep you connected. 
third thing, set up wpa security for your wireless router. 
this also helps to keep you connected and keeps leaches off your internet connection.
