i have a western digital &quot;my book essential edition&quot; external hard drive. 
when i plug it into a usb 2.0 port (i've tried it on numerous computers that have usb 2.0 ports), i get a message that says the drive will run faster if connected to a usb 2.0 port. 
if you use the hard drive, i have determined that it is operating rather slowly, as if its a 1.0 drive. 
its as if the usb port is not recognizing the drive as a usb 2.0 device. 
not sure what to do next as it does not appear that there is a new firmware download available and the unit is out of warranty. 
any help would be appreciated. 
thanks.
