typical hd install doesn't require a driver, though the system should be ready for it. 
i suggest you check the dell support website and verify what bios updates maybe present for your model#. 
while there query their support forum on this topic. 
if bios status is behind, do the update it *may* address the problem. 
if possible see what the bios update actually addresses. 
but since, you have a 2.1tb hd, that alone makes it somehow unique. 
to add further all the other devices just stacks on the issue if they are related at all. 
it maybe treating the hd as a br drive only because the capacity issues or is close to what br is and defaults to it. 
samsung may offer a faq on this topic, query or review their support website. 
how is it treated as a br player, is there an actual message/error/display to that effect? 
edited from www... -- start your computer and enter the bios. 
-- get your motherboard manual and check sections -- do you see the blu-ray and the hdd on your computer screen? 
if not, try changing your sata configuration - open screen in your bios. 
-- configure sata as ahci(if present) -- save and exit the bios.
