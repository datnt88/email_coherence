have you monitored your graphics card and cpu temperature? 
i'm willing to bet that if you did, you would notice that your cooling for either the northbridge, the cpu or the graphics card (although unlikely) is inadequate. 
if the cpu overheats, it will reset or shutdown the computer. 
that's a protection built into most motherboards. 
the fact that it occurs about 15 minutes after starting up the computer also points the overheat situation. 
memory could be an issue, but failures due to bad memory are usually less predictable than what you are describing.
