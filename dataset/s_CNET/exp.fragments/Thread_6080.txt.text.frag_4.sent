i know better than to convert it to ntfs. 
yes it should fix it but since there is no backup the conversion while it works 99.99% of the time is it worth the risk of no backup? 
only you can answer that. 
since i know the risk i won't tell you how to convert. 
but you can find out with a google like &quot;windows xp how to convert to ntfs?&quot; sorry to hear another no backup story. 
these rarely end well. 
need evidence? 
look at entries in this very forum.
