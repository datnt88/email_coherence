far from scientific, but my method is 100 watts per big device. 
10 watts for little things (webcam, scanner.) the laset is all over the map from 1000 watts when printing to some under 10 idle, so the 100 watt number evens out the numbers. 
you can also go to radio shack and for under 20 bucks get a ac wattmeter if you want to be accurate, but you may be surprised how close i am. bob
