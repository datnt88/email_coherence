if you want the ultimate image processing machine right now..the quad...if you want to be certain that five years down the road, you will still be happy...wait...i was disappointed that there was not a new quad but i was also certain that there would not be as that is going to be the very last machine to change over as most of the pro software will have to go to a universal binary before professionals will change. 
i will wait for an intel powermac. 
instead, in the meantime, i ordered a 30 inch screen (!!!) and the new macbook pro laptop so that i can work with a faster machine than my dual 800 powermac which is long in the tooth and feels so very slow compared to pretty much any other machine nowadays. 
with the laptop having rosetta and four times faster than the old powerbook, i figure it has to be about as fast or faster than the ldual 800 even in emulation and when the new software is intel native...it will fly. 
i will then get the powermac and end up with a nice laptop for work on the road and take it with the camera for on sight work...the best of both worlds. the screen naturally will go with the intel powermac. 
all of this to say, if you are going to work with large files which require a lot of ram, you have no choice but to go for the old quad (!) or wait. 
if you do not stress the ram levels of an amateur machine, get the new imac intel which holds the same ram level as the macbook pro and is slightly faster overall...insignificant but cheaper machine. 
if you need the ram then ...wait for 8 more months..the baby is in the oven...
