living offgrid, no landlines likely in my lifetime, got the gamers 17&quot; artorius laptop from vigor, 18 mo. 
old for desktop replacement loads of upgrades and addons and seller left almost all his stuff on, so have been cleaning alot. 
using ccleaner, defraggler,(same site) and revouninstaller, too much stuff sharing to reformat with os. had it a month now and runs like new except startup still abit slow, have more to get rid of...and we will live happily with no bugs. 
and i'm an old slow brain ...
