thanks for this insight. 
i thought, it might have something to do with &quot;n&quot; but not enough to know that my interface cards need to support &quot;n&quot;. 
i have not changed any interface cards on the computers and do not plan to. 
so, i will be getting the &quot;g&quot; router. 
any suggestions one better than other. 
i have ordered the linksys (as i used to have that). 
if there is another suggestion, please advise. 
thanks..
