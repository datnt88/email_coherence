hi, my girlfriend has a garage apartment about 35 yards outside the house. 
she has a wireless modem, with time warner roadrunner, as a wireless network in about a 3000 square foot house. 
i can find out what specific modem she has if need be. 
what would we need to get the wireless internet out to the apartment? 
i want to setup some computers and she also wants to be able to offer internet to her prospective tenants. 
thanks for you help!
