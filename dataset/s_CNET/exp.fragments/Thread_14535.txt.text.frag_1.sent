three weeks ago i purchased a 19 inch widescreen monitor model #s199wfp from dell. 
starting last week from time to time a thin purplish vertical line appears in the left quarter of the screen at various times and then disappears, sometimes for a few hours at a time but it always returns. 
tech support at dell has been very poor, they requiring i keep a journal for a week to note every time the problem occurs and what i'm doing at the time, despite the fact it came with a three year warranty and i'm to call them at the end of that week if the problem continues. 
my question is could it possibly be the video card causing the problem and not the monitor? 
my system is a dell inspiron 530s which i bought five weeks ago. 
or could it be something else i'm doing? 
i would rather not have to deal with the rude tech support from dell of india. 
anyone else have issues with dell tech support or is this just an isolated case? 
any help appreciated.
