hello, i currently have a 2002 dell dimension 8200 with 256k ram and am running xp professional. the type of ram the system has is rdram, which i found is quite expensive to upgrade even to 1gb. the computer runs very slow when multiple applications are being used. 
at this point i'm debating whether it would be best to upgrade the memory,purchase a new computer or even build my own. 
i've also been suggested to replace the motherboard so that a different type of ram module can be used. 
any suggestions would be helpful. 
thanks.
