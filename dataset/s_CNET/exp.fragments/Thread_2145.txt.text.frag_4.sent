thanks for the replies bob and anmor. 
i checked to verify that the printer was connected via a usb port again and came up with the same error i was getting yesterday: &quot;an error occurred during port configuration. 
access is denied.&quot; 
btw, this port is listed as a virtual port, the same as my other printer. 
i told epson about this error but they had no clue about it. is that error familiar to anyone? 
thanks again for taking the time to reply. 
cheers - kalli
