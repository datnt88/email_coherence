the basic machine is a very stock hp d5000t (not sure about the letter t) but it is some hp intel quad core. the overall number is 5.5 with the video being 6.5. 
sorry but i won't install everest today. 
the pixel shader the last time i looked was 2.0 or greater. 
but we never looked at that since all games play fine. 
hope this helps.
