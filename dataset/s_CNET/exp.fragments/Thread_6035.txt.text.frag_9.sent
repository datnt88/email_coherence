sorry i said use arctic silver thermal glue (adhesive) - do not use this on a cpu - you must use the arctic thermal silver compound clean the surface of the processor and the heat sink with alcohol. 
all clean out the fins of the hs with a thin cloth - it is a bit of work, but worth it to get of every piece of dirt and fluff which wil retain heat. 
see the website for instrucrions good luck with it newkid
