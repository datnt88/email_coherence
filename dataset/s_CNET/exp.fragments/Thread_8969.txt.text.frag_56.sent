a few years ago my 15 gb disk started failing but only after it was on for 1 or 2 minutes. 
the system could not read or write anything to it anymore. 
i wanted to copy all 'important' information on it, so i took it out and placed it in the refrigerator at 4c for an hour. 
i connected it back to the pc, and it gave me 10...15 minutes now. 
i did this twice and had my copy. 
second case: the mechanical part of the disk were still ok, but something went wrong with the electronical part (the pcb of the hard disk). 
i could replace it with an identical one from another drive, and could get back all data without problem.
