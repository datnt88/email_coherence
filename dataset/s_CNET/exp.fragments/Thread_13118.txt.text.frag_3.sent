i don't see this pc as the greatest out there but it is respectable. 
however, i do see this as a dated pc when compared to gaming usage. 
if this pc was in fact used as a gaming platform, it got used under stressful conditions and you're left with what available provided it still works well. 
it's used, you take it all with a grain of salt. 
if you plan to re-use as a gaming platform, then you must before you actually do, tweek it up or assure that what you can is at a level to do all it can do as a &quot;stable pc&quot; platform. 
i would see this pc at the $250-300 range and prove what is new is new if not, reduce the cost more. 
that's imho.
