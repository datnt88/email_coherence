i saw this on the ati radeon site; &quot;ati eyefinity technology works with games that support non-standard aspect ratios, which is required for panning across multiple displays. 
to enable more than two displays, additional panels with native displayport connectors, and/or displayport compliant active adapters to convert your monitors native input to your cards displayport or mini-displayport connector(s), are required. 
ati eyefinity technology can support up to 6 displays using a single enabled ati radeon graphics card with windows vista or windows 7 operating systems - the number of displays may vary by board design and you should confirm exact specifications with the applicable manufacturer before purchase. 
systems using multiple ati radeon graphics cards can support a maximum of 8 displays (total across all cards in system) with a maximum 6 of those displays being used together in a display group (also known as a single large surface mode)&quot; {note 2). 
seems you may need something extra.
