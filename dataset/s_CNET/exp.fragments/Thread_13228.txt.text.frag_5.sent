upon initial install the verizon software might put certain items on the pc that set it up. 
it's been awhile but you enter a lot of information to get it working. 
my point is without a router your wifes pc might have this information on it and your desk top doesnt so it's not recognizing your pc as being legit. 
i use a 4 port wired router and 2 pc are connect constantly with a 3rd work pc connected occasionally. 
i have not problems with this setup and was the best $50 i ever spent because the router is a spi firewall.
