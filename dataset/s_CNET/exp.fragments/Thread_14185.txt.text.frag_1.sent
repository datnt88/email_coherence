i would like to set up a computer in a public area, and i'd like to attach a printer. 
however, it would have to be one which was coin-operated, as otherwise it will be impossible to fund, and without the need to pay, it would be taken advantage of. is there any printer that could handle the hardware and software aspects of a pay-per-page system? 
as it would be in the uk, it would (ideally) need to recognize english currency. 
obviously, the lower maintenance and running cost, the better. 
black and white would be fine. 
any suggestions? 
thank you
