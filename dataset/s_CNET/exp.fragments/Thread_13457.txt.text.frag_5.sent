from what i can gather from the sis support site, even their newest igp chipsets only support up to 1600x1200. 
this doesn't meet your demand. 
if you do intend to then upgrade to an agp card, when you purchase it, make sure you go to a reputable dealer and explain to them that the agp slot is 2.0 2x 4x. the card &quot;should&quot; state if it's backwards compatible. 
make for darn sure the guys or girl knows what their talking about because if they're wrong, bye bye motherboard. 
it appears from what i can determine that a msi agp in the range of e would suit your needs and i believe would be compatible. 
this may be hard to find, but as i've said, just make sure it's compatible. 
in addition you'll probably want a card with 256 mb of ram to keep that kind of resolution running smothly. 
good luck, feel free to contact me if you decide to make any purchases.
