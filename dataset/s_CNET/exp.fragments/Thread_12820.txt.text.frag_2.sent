i'm just a consumer, not a computer geek. 
you can have a look at the benchmark test results which will tell you what cards are &quot;better&quot;. 
whether getting a more powerful card would be noticeably better for you, i'm not sure. 
i've got computers with old hardware and computers with &quot;good&quot; graphics. 
i'm sure there is a difference &quot;under the hood&quot; but for everyday things, i can't really tell the difference. 
hopefully, it would make a difference for your photoshop and art design. the extent of the improvement might be impacted by your processor. 
also, what type of monitor do you have? 
a mediocre monitor might not give you the results you want from a better video card. 
i'd start with the cards available at your local computer shop at a price you like the look of, then check it on the benchmarks ranking and then google some reviews and see what the reviewers have to say. 
you might also be better off looking for a secondhand card.
