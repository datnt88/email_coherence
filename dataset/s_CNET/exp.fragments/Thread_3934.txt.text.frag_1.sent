i'm sure this is one of the most simple things in the world but after hours of trying i still cannot print an enlarged (600% - or any percent!) copy from my scanjet 4370. 
i've tried via the image zone as well as the so-called solution center but without success. 
does anybody have a real solution??! any help gratefully received!
