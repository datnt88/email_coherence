so i installed the two programs you mentioned and at idle my temp seems to be around 20 c and when i turn on prime 95 my temperture quickly climbs to over 50 c and a little fire icon appears...i assume this is a bad thing. 
so i figure i will try what was suggested by kestrel731 and go and buy some thermal grease to see if it helps any. 
please feel free to post any other suggestions or tips, and thank you very much so far. 
i'll update my status when i try the thermal grease. 
thanks again.
