just google for hd erase/wiping clean type of search, much of it is free. 
these same pgms. 
work on ext. 
media, unless stated differently. 
you can still reformat as a basic cleaning operation and unless the new user is keen on recovery, will do fine. 
if you have no secrets then the typical cleaning s/w will do. 
as for writing 0-1's to the cleaned drive, well again unless you have a nosy character, no one going to the trouble of reclaiming old data. 
reloading an os or other s/w can make recovery difficult as this is a different yet somewhat random pattern of 1-0's. 
then again, look at who you give or sell to as a guide. 
i've used killdisk and dban on much of cleaning/wiping media and its done well by me. 
if you're that worried about it, don't sell/give it away, destroy it.
