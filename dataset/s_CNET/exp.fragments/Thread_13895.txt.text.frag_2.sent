you could have a weak or failing psu(power supply) or the infamous bad caps on mtrbd.. google(for example) for bad caps, but inspect the mtrbd. 
for leaking, distorted or bulging caps(capacitors). 
since, you have a 1.8mhz system that suggests you had it for awhile as that's dated and/or been around. 
in that time the psu has aged and possibly on its last legs. the bad caps is known problem from bad manufacture of caps. 
in either case, replace, i suggest the psu, first unless you see bad caps.
