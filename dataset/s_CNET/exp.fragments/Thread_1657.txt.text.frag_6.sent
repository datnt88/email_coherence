well i hooked up my old hd as a slave in the new machine and just moved the files over that way. 
now since that part is taken care of, i need to format my old hard drive and still buy an enclosure to mount it in so i can have a good backup system in place in case of any future problems. 
what's the simplest way to format a drive and handle this task? 
can it be done while in the enclosure or will i need to hook up the old hd as a slave again in the new machine to do it?
