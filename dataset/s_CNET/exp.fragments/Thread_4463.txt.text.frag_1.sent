ok, so i had a 2.4ghz cordless phone in my kitchen and then i went wireless and installed a di-614+ router in my living room. 
the problem that i'm having is simple. 
when using the cordless phone, i notice a pulsing sound in the background, which i'm sure is the routers signal. 
that i can deal with. the real concern here is that sometimes when the phone rings, i'll go to answer it and it won't pick up. is a 2.4ghz router supposed to work alongside a 2.4ghz phone (except for the pulsating noise)? 
should i consider paying more for a 5.8ghz phone or can i just get another 2.4 phone that isn't a piece of junk?
