i have joined sky and today i tried to set up their router, it has connected to the laptop (which is vista) but not to my desktop (which is xp). 
i have called sky and they were very unhelpful. 
i dont have time to argue with them to get it working so i was hoping to get some help from this forum can anyone direct me to where i can get some troubleshooting tutorials to get around my problem. 
i have been looking but so far haven't found anything that has helped
