hi, i have a little problem, and i've been trying to find some answers on the net, but nothing. 
i have put a new cpu cooler - coolermaster hyper 6+ in my computer. 
it's a 4-pin cooler connected on a 4-pin connector on the intel d975xbxlkr bad axe motherboard with 975x express chipset. 
i have intel pentium d 930 processor. 
so, the problem is that the temperature of my cpu is 46 degrees with opened case, and 51-58 with closed case and the fan speed is max. 
1750rpm. the cooler specif. 
says that the fan speed is from 1800-3600 rpm. 
i have installed speed fan and all the fans (front, rear and cpu-fan) are monitored and controlled trough emc6d103 chip and as i understand, pwm function. 
i've tryed to change the speed with speedfan, but nothing happends. 
with the default processor fan i had the same temperature results, but he changed the speed normaly, from 1900-2500 rpm. 
help please, if you have any idee. 
thx!!
