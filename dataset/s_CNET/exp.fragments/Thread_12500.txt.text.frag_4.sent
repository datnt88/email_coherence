well, thanks for your answers, appreciated. 
i will cool the thing with an additional 150mm fan blowing filtered air through the side panel at the cpu fan intake and some should go (the extra being bigger) over the ram, too. 
so i thought i could get away with the stock cooler... can't find a tray cpu here at the moment, but if any uk readers have a source, i'll be grateful for that! the ram is that low because, frankly, i'm running a bit low on money; it's going to get some more in a few months. the system is planned to run a dual boot of xp sp3 (is there an issue with 6 gb ram other than it being not used?) and 64 bit ubuntu lucid. 
i heard something about the ati drivers on lucid not being all that good, is that true? 
because i would be tempted to reconsider and go for a nvidia gpu, although for the price i wouldn't get a comparable one over here.
