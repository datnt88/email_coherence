i just got an external hard drive with a 160gb hitachi hard drive in it. the enclosure is a usb 2.0 pm-350-u2. 
i hook it up to my computer and the drivers install and report no problems. 
i have 3 usb 2.0 ports and tried them all. 
i also have windows xp pro sp2. the disk also does not appear on the disk management utility. 
can someone please help me.
