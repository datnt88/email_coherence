thanks for the info, bob. 
i've read microsoft's cautions about that utility and it makes me nervous. 
by the way, my sound came back after i bought and installed registry mechanic. 
it found hundreds of errors which have now all been repaired. 
i still can't get backup to launch but at least i've got a clean registry and have sound.
