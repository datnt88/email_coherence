about pc.. to wit...i know nothing about programming. 
some know both but it's hard to keep up with...change is the only constant. 
anyway...if you get a chance....try testing the old ram. 
and by all means test the new ram immediately on receipt...remember to unplug the ac power and remove the laptop battery before removing the old ram or installing the new ram. 
let us know how it works. 
vapcmd ps&gt;&gt;&gt;while you've got that laptop open, try blowing out any dust bunnies with some compressed air. 
heat is a common problem for laptops. 
download and run pc wizard 2008 and then minimize it....you can watch your system temps in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
