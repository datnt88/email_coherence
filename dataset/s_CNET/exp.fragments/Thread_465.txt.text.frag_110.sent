i'm very happy with my hp xw4600 workstation (purchased for similar price to a desktop) and the samsung 22&quot; wide screen monitor attached. 
i find that having two built in hard drives very handy in keeping data on one drive and the op system on the other (especialy with respect to unstable vista in the first week - had to reinstall it completely). 
installed an all in one media card reader (dirt cheap) and also added the linksys n series wireless adapter - very fast wireless broadband connection which makes the g look like a snail. 
trouble is i will now have to upgrade all the other wireless adaptors on other pcs i have to the n !! cheers, graeme.
