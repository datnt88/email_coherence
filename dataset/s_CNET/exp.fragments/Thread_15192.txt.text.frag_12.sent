for a resolution at or above 1280*1024 (most lcd's) you need at least a 7600gt or ati based x1650xt -- preferably a 7950gt nvida based card (bfg card) or ati x1950 pro or xt to run any intensive flight sim at respectable frame rates -- you can get away with a 7600gt or x1650xt for lower budgets if you're using a crt wherer you can scale resolutions anytime you want from 800*600 to 1600*1200 at a 5:4 ratio. 
most lcd's are 1280*1024 or above and need to be run at the native resolution only to avoid scaling issues. 
lower end but doable higher end and better yet a bit higher and much better
