hi bob - i just bought this system from dell (xps 410) in june. 
i believe i am logged in as the admin. 
i am the only one who uses the computer and i have to log in when it starts up. 
i tried checking under administrative tools via the start menu, but it didn't give me any info. 
about the administrator (which could be totally user error on my part, i am not familiar with admin.). 
sorry i missed telling you all that before cheers - kalli
