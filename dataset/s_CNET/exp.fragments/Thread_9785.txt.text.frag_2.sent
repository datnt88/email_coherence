before i begin, that machine looks solid: good job! 
let's go! 
i'm gonna skip the cpu and talk abt in the end. the 2gb is good, very good actually. 
storage/removable storage looks good. 
for clarifcation, this is your motherboard, correct: motherboard looks good, i like the hybridish combination of agp and pci-e. 
(btw, is that a typo in the mobo description?) the only thing that isn't very very best in it's field is just the cpu and gpu. 
if you are getting solid numbers in games, i would upgrade the cpu. 
if it is sluggish in non-gpu intensive apps, like uh... word? 
(lol) jk, but you know that i mean, right? 
also, whats the wattage, make, and maybe rails of the psu? 
name and series would work, too. 
a reasonable upgrade for the mobo would be either semi-entry line x2, maybe the 4200+ or if you look hard enough, you could squeeze in a 4400+. 
(mobo does support x2) i think they have the same clock, not sure though. 
think it is more advanced in other things. 
anyways, if you get a gpu i'd go for a 7800gt, easily in your budget. 
or do want to buy both a gpu and a cpu? 
otherwise, the machine looks good. 
good luck, and remember in the end: its your call.
