i'm sorry, i did not understand your message about hard drive, usb port. 
my problem is with a pci card that is supposed to give me usb 2.0 & firewire ports. the card seems to have major driver issues with win xp and i do have sp2 loaded. the people who sell this card seem to play dumb. 
just looking to see if this is a lousy generic card and that there are in fact no legit drivers out there for this. 
i can't seem to find a legit tech support site for this as well. 
maybe someone can even recommend a bargain usb 2.0 card out there. 
-thanks, russ
