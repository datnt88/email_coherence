like tomshardware.com, 
anandtech.com, 
etc., and others. 
read the buyer reviews at newegg.com ... very very few products never mind motherboards, get such positive initial feedback. 
it's not that i don't like msi, asus, gigabyte, etc., the positive comments and reviews across the board are just great ! 
your call...just thought you might be interested in what appears to be better. 
let us know.
