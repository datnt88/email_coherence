i am of the understanding that your motherboard has 4 usb 2.0 ports, and 4 usb 1.1 ports, no? anyway, you have a 66 mhz pci controller. 
depending on the speed of your internal drive, you could get up to 200 mb/s transfer rate, compared with only 60 on usb 2.0. 
on 1.1, it's much, much slower. 
your transfer rate on a usb 1.1 port maxes out at 12 mbps, or 1.5 megabytes per second. 
that's slooooooow.
