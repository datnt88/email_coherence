you've got the wrong idea here... one harddrive does not read another. 
it's the os. older os, such as windows 95, cannot read ntfs because it does not support the newer file system. 
if you have windows nt, 2000, xp or above, it doesn't matter what kind of mix of file systems you have. 
you can partition one harddrive into two drives, one running on fat and the other on ntfs, and it will work fine.
