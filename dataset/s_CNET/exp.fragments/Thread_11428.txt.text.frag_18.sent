i agree with all the comments about price. 
microsoft and adobe think most of us have more money than we do. 
however, i use my android tablet to take minutes for meetings, and i'd love to have the full, or nearly-full version of office on my tablet. 
at this point, i use evernote to take notes, then copy/paste them into word. 
evernote is great, but limited to simple text formatting. 
i want a multilevel outline framework, for example.
