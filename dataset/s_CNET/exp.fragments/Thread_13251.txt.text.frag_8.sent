wifi connections can be tricky. 
for instance whatever drivers are in the box are often out of date. 
if the device has firmware, it's likely out of date too. 
and to top it all off, unless those antenna can see each other within 99 feet and even then the connection can drop due to interference. 
if you need a connection that doesn't drop, then don't use wifi. 
it's that simple.
