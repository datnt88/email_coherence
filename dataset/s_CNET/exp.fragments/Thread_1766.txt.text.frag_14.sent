ok... after much review i think i should buy the geforce 6800 ultra. 
i'm not sure if this card would be compatible with inventor but i think it might be. 
i would like to find a 6800 ultra with 512 mb oof ram but i can't find one anywhere. 
in fact i can't find any 6800 ultras anywhere! 
anyone have any idea if this is a good card for inventor and games and if so where i can get one??
