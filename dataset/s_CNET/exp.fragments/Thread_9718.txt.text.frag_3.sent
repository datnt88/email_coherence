so it isn't their problem anymore. 
that's understandable. 
you might tell more, such as: - if the desktop connects wired (did you use the right cable, do the led's light up) or wireless. 
- what the xp troubleshooting tool told you. it should come up in ie if it can't connect. 
- if it did work with your previous router. 
- what ipconfig tells you (run from the command prompt). 
- what exactly you mean with &quot;connect&quot;. can you ping the router, for example?
