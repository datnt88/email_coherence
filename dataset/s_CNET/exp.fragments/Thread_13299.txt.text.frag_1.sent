it seems there is a very wide difference in opinion between cnet reviewers and and consumers regarding printers. 
i'm looking for a aio wireless for a new imac and once i access a review the opposite seems to be the case made by actual users which is confusing. 
anybody have any suggestions? 
thanks.
