that was a problem about this version of tweakui. 
once you read how to install tweakui, proceed to the panel that allows you to show/hide drive letters and make sure all are allowed. 
tweakui installs by a right-click on the .inf and then selecting install. 
maybe you tried that, but didn't write you did. 
always elaborate as much as possible.
