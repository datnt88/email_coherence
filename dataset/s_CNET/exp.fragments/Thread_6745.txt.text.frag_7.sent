if the temp was really 240 your cpu would be fried. 
i hope you meant a pea sized dot of paste instead of an amount of paste the size of a pea. 
once you spread it out it should be thin enough that none squirts out the side when you mount the heatsink. 
did you visually verify that the cpu fan was spinning? 
personally i would be very suspicious of the power supply. 
i would not go for more watts i would use a better company. 
seasonic, fortran, silverstone, antec, enermax all make pretty good power supplies.
