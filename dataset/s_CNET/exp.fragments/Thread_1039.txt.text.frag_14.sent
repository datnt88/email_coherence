a friend i used to know who is the sharpest pc guy i've ever met (yes employed in the industry) stated it quite simply, unless you keep the environment pretty close temperature wise to what the motherboard and other boards see while it's in operation, don't ever shut it down. the expansion and contraction due to temperature differences eventually causes fractures in the circuitry. 
worst case scenario, if your pc is in a spare room you keep closed off in winter rather than heating with the rest of the house and you're in the upper midwest, what's the nighttime temperature, well below freezing? 
what happens the next day when the sun and furnace heat the room and you use the pc, what's the temperature spread? 
now repeat this daily.... not alot unlike the way aircraft track flight hours and takeoff/landing cycles, the expansion and contraction of the fuselage reaching cruising altitude then back to ground level due to atmospheric pressure is abusive.
