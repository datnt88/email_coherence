i have run dx diagnostics and it comes up with no problems. 
i did change my agp setting to 4x instead of 8x and it seems to be working ok. i have been on sites that have made it crash without trouble such as youtube. 
i think i'll just have to change to 4x mode when i'm surfing the net for a while and go back to 8x when playing games. 
thanks for the help. 
if changing to 4x does not fix it, then i'll post here again
