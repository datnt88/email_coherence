yes is the answer. 
almost all products referred to by the brand name have been recognised by the public due to the massive publicity generated about them. 
they have to be a good product which lives up to the hype about it and there is no doubt apple have a very effective publicity machine pushing their brand name in front our faces. the product doesn't have to be the best on the market, just needs to have the best sales pitch. 
personally i see no use for a tablet and detest touch screens of all kinds.
