so i replaced the mother board and everything is working now. 
however, when i'm trying to reinstall the os i'm getting an error that the hdd isn't installed. 
the computer has a 1tb seagate barracuda, it has three different plus however only one of cables fits, the other 2 ports i don't have a cable for. 
any suggestions?
