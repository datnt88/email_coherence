if you want to be done with it, sell it for $50-75 to include the s/w bundle that came with it, to include the restore/recovery cds if so supplied. 
because, once you've reformatted or wipe the hd clean 100% you will be cleaning out also the &quot;hidden partition&quot; of the hd supplied recovery/restore process. 
in such cases the extra cost of getting the cds if needed will go against you if the buyer needs them. 
your system or similar is very common, so don't be too high on sale price and remember its old stuff. 
understand a brand new system of entry offerings to include laptops are in the $300+ range on sale or not. 
to wipe clean the hd of any install entirely use dban or killdisk, google for them. 
of course, save any critical data you deem important.
