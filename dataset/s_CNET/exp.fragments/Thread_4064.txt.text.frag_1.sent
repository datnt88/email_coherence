i just installed hdd thermometer and am concerned at the results that i'm seeing. 
5 year old maxtor 7200rpm 80gb ultra ata drive runs between 49 and 55 degrees c new seagate 7200rpm 320gb sata drive runs between 43 and 49 degrees c this while running very few programs. 
zone alarm free edition and avg free edition, windows messenger and aim, as well as firefox to write this post. 
as far as hard drive usage is concerned, i would imagine that's fairly low. 
how big of a problem is this? 
i didn't monitor my hard drive temperatures before installing this new drive. 
however, as i installed it i noticed there was very little clearance between my 3.5&quot; devices and i thought it might cause a problem. 
i'm assuming the maxtor was running cooler before putting the new hard drive in but i cannot be sure. 
if i look for a cooling solution it will probably have to be a new case. 
my case currently has no fans as far as i can tell. 
it appears that there is room for a fan below the hard drive tray and also room for a fan at the back. 
i don't really see how a fan below the hard drive tray will cool the hard drive down. 
i could see how one at the back sucking air through might though. 
anyways, if i were to get fans, i'd have to get a new power supply. 
i have a crappy power supply and it only has enough connectors for what i already have installed...two hard drives, a dvd drive, a cd-rw drive, and a floppy drive. 
anyways, i guess at a minimum i'm looking at buying a fan and a better powersupply if this is a serious issue. 
possibly a new case and a new power supply. 
what do you guys think? 
is this really serious? 
should i be unplugging one of the drives until i can get it sorted out or just get it sorted out within a week or so? 
thanks.
