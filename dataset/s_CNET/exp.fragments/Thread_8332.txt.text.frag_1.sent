i am thinking about buying an external hard drive to save mainly my music, pictures, and word documents. 
i really don't have anything else that important to back up or worry about. 
but i have a few questions i can't seem to find an answer for. 
1. if i buy a new external is it as simple as plugging in the usb and begin copying and pasting files to that drive? 
2. i have noted from other threads the external would not be safe from being infected with viruses and such and being completely wiped out. 
would simply unplugging the external drive when not in use protect it from the bugs? 
3. i can use the external to shuffle information between two computers right? 
(ie. 
desktop in my dorm room and desktop at home) i know this is a very basic and simple question, but i'm a computer newbie and just overwhelmed with all the different ways of storing info. 
thanks for any help i can get.
