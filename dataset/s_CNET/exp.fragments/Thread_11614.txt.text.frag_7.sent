hi col & toni, i tried to reseat the ram, the cpu fan/power connection to the mobo, and the hard disk cord connection. 
i don't want to re-intall the cpu itself coz that is too much. 
the cpu is tightly connected to the motherboard, its too tight it may not even be bothered at all if you moved the case a lot. 
now regarding the cords, maybe you are right col, as i've said to ray, my computer works with two pronged extension cord than three pronged extension cord, i don't know why. 
although it is working before in the two pronged extension cord, now it's not working, no power at all. 
its only a split second spin of the cpu fan and case fan when pressing the power switch. 
i'm not sure whether to replace the computer's power supply or just buy an avr automatic voltage regulator would solve the problem. 
there seems to be no burnt smell on the power supply though.
