when we talk windows i go back to usb. 
you are more than welcome to try firewire but what risk is there since you'll keep a backup for the day it fails or goes missing? 
and the same for usb drives. 
this forum is flooded with folks that thought usb and drives in general were &quot;storage&quot;. 
all externals seem to fail sooner than internals.
