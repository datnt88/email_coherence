im going to build a new desktop and need help selecting the components within my price range. 
i play a lot of mmo's so im going to need pretty powerful system. 
my budget is somewhere around $1,300 give or take a little. 
so far i have decided on the processor (amd athlon 64 x2 duel core 6400+) and the video card (geforce 8800 gt). 
i am open for suggestions on different processors and video cards if they will be better suited for the overall computer. 
thanks in advance to anyone responding.
