nope, that's not the primary purpose of the raid connectors. 
you have to use the either the primary/secondary eide ports, not the raid ports. 
unless, it is configuarble, then maybe and that's a big maybe. 
your bios setting should explained in the manual or support website thier usage of all ide ports. 
if you have 4 ide devices already installed, then consider what has to be swapped or gone in order to use your new drive. 
if you have small hds, now is the time for a larger hd to complish the same mbs is not more. 
sorry... tada -----willy
