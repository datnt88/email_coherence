i was thinking this morning of taking it back in favor of another, and on a lark decided to try the s video port. 
it worked, though at s video resolution. 
shut everything down, plugged the dvi port in again, and blammo, everything works perfect in full hd. i have no idea why or how, but i'll take it.
