the other network was not setup per our forum sticky. 
that is something like ssid not broadcasting and the next connect fails. 
i can't explain why this doesn't always work since you can imagine the number of times this comes up in the forum. 
so here's my advice. 
read the forum sticky on what we have found to work in most cases.
