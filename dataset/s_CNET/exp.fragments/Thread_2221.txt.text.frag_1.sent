i just fixed a pc that belongs to a friend of mine. 
basically, i formatted the hard drive and reinstalled xp. though i don't know if the computer was slow before, it's slow now. 
well, it's slow when there are webpages involving flash, and slow when i try to resize any window. 
i have narrowed down the problem components to the processor and video. 
i wonder if the slowness is due to the intel celeron socket 478 @ 1.73ghz, or could it be the integrated sis 650 graphics? 
i'm leaning towards the graphics being the culprit. 
what do you think?
