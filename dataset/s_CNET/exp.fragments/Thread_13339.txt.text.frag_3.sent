a $50 keyboard/mouse with a $66 cpu on a $130 motherboard. 
consider a biostar tforce 8200 mobo for $90, microsoft wireless desktop 4000 includes a laser mouse for $20 less. 
use the $60 savings to upgrade elsewhere. 
at least get an x2 6000+ since it's only $10 more. 
use the remaining $50 on this 20&quot; monitor for $140: an antec basiq 500u power supply is the same price as your selection but a better brand. 
this bfg 9800gtx is a smidge faster than your video card selection but $20 cheaper. 
this bfg 9800gtx+ is faster still and the same price as your card.
