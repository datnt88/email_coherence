i had a scsi scanner installed in my old computer but don't see a port i could use to plug it into on my new computer. 
my current computer is a dell model 4700 p-4 with win xp home operating system with 512 ram. is there any type adapter that would allow me to use a pci card slot for a scsi scanner? 
as you can see i'm not all that knowledgeable so if my question is ridiculous try not to laugh. 
thanks
