don't take this hard but if you ask this question, you won't be doing this very soon. 
besides the equipment to do so can run past 4 figures. 
as to finding the pcb, i re-read your first post and you seem to claim you already did this. 
if not then you get on google.com and search for who sells said drive, or on ebay. 
you might even buy a complete machine that has the drive. 
you do the search... as to ebay data recovery. 
i wouldn't do that. 
i'd stick with the names such as drive savers or ontrack. 
best of luck, bob
