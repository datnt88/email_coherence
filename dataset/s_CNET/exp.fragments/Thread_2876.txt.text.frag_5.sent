it doesn't have lightscribe but it's getting great reviews from buyers. 
might want to check out lightscribe before you get to set on it... it might require more than it's worth. 
you should probably get an ide cd-dvd drive if your mb is the asus a7n8x mb....the a7n8x-la is an asus mb made for hp we need more info about the hp model number and series to assist further. 
happy computing vapcmd
