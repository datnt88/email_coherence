okay now i have a laptop but take it to my dorm and at home. 
when im at home i want the sharing but when im at the dorms i dont want to share. 
im using vista premium. 
am i able to make it share only when it connects to a certain network...for example my network is called guard(its private). 
am i able to have it only enable when it connect to guard?
