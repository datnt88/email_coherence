i just upgraded to verizon's mifi 2200 because i was tired of having to wrestle my partner for the single use usb modem i used to have. the problem was that neither of our desktop computers had wireless capability so i went out and purchased two belkin wireless g 7050 adapters. 
after installing the drivers i found that both computers would connect, then disconnect and would or would not reconnect when hitting the repair option for the network icon. 
i decided to try using my laptop, which has a built in wireless device, to see if it was the belkin adapter. 
i learned that if only one of the belkin adaptors is in use, everything works find. 
so, the laptop and one desktop can be on line, but not the two desktops at the same time. 
i wrote belkin about this but have yet to hear back. 
does anyone have an idea as to why the mifi will not connect through two belkin adapters at the same time? 
any suggestions would be appreciated.
