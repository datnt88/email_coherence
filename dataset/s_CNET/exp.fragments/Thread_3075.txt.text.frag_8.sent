i got an retail memorex 512mb usb flash memory from staples just under a year ago. 
it costed $20 w/o requiring any mirs. 
came with driver cd, lanyard, and warranty info. 
one day, i couldn't find it. 
searched everywhere i could've thought of, but nowhere to be found i got an oem memorex 1gb flash mem for $32 back in early april this year from 3btech. 
it's just the module and the protective cap over the plug. 
bought some lanyards from a one-dollar store and strung that up. 
as of now, it hasn't failed on me yet.
