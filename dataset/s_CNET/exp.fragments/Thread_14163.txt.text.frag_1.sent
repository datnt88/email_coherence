i just recieved my sapphire x1800gto today and installed catalyst 6.4, restarted, then loaded call of duty 2 after about two minutes of playing multiplayer, vpu recover came up and forced me to shutdown call of duty. 
sometimes i will be at the menu to start a server and it will vpu recover. 
tried on other games, same problem. 
i have tried the following drivers, uninstalling the old one first: catalyst 6.3 catalyst 6.4 catalyst 6.4 beta x1800gto crossfire remember that this is a fresh installation of windows and call of duty. it will never vpu recover when i am using an application or on the desktop, only 3d games. 
i have sent numerous error reports to ati. 
specs: athlon 64 x2 3800+ @ 2.25ghz dfi rdx200-cf 2gb corsair xms memory 250gb seagate sata1
