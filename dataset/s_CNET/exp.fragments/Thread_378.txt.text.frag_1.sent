i formated, then istalled windows me in a computer. 
now i can't get the modem working. 
it is an ambient data fax voice (md-cn5614ch). 
i've tryed quite a few drivers already. 
while intalling the modem a message appears, &quot;confix has caused and error in kernel32...&quot;. 
i've tryed it in windows 98se too already, and it does the same thing. 
if i go to control panel - modems - diagnostics - select modem - more information, after a while a message appears with something like this. if it is an external modem, make sure it is connected and turned on. 
if it is an internal modem make sure the interupt port is properly set. 
if i check the interupt port, there are on conflicts, neither can i change it. 
also if i check the &quot;diagnostics - more information&quot; i can hear the modem making a few short and very silent &quot;chirps&quot; (sounds). 
can you help me figure it out?
