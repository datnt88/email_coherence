i also see errors in the event log in admin tools. 
event 1001- your cpu was not assigned an address by the dhcp server. 
do i need to have dhcp activated? 
why am i the only one with the problem? 
shouldn't messing with my router settings affect all? 
ths prob is unfixible. 
i also don't know what wps is...s
