i beleive that we should shoot for total lock downs. 
we should find every means of protection to secure our computers and lives. 
purchasing the iphantom only increases our security along with other measures. 
i am glad to see that you agree the combination of software security along with that of the iphantoms gateway security is a good thing. 
nothing can protect you from everything, but this combination is the best i have found out there.
