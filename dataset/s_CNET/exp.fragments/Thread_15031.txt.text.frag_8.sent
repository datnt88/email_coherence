my modem uses either usb or ethernet connection. 
originally, i had a usb connection via verizon dsl. 
never had a sign on id; went directly to internet explorer. 
i hooked up the new computer to the modem via usb, just to see if it would work; it did. 
disconnected everything, attached router and modem ethernet cables accordingly. 
all indicator lights work, but no connection to internet. 
when i ran cd both for router and verizon, states no connection. 
tried this repeatedly. 
went to best buy to have the geek squad come in and fix, but if i can do it and save $170, would help. 
also now it appears the ethernet cable light on the back of the computer is not coming on. 
any suggestions appreciated. 
thanks
