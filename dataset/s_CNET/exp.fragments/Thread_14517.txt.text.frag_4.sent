i was under the misimpression this was a new drive added to a working system. 
-&gt; here's the deal. 
with your new information it appears you have some custom machine that you placed a hard disk on a nonstandard raid ide connection. 
since you don't have multiple drives this is a mistake in setup. 
also your post is void of all makes and models so i can only offer the best move is to move the drive to the normal first ide channel and attempt a normal setup.
