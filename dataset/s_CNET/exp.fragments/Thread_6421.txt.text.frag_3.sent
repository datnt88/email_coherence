there isn't a massive gap, the x2 5000 will bench faster, and you might notice it by a hair (if you owned both and could compare them side by side) in a few games (fear, supreme commander, hitman 4, ones that load onto the cpu with some force) however between the two, if you just owned one, you wouldn't likely notice it, if theres more than ~$30 between them, i'd go for the 4400 unless you can afford either the 8600gt is going to be faster than the 8300gs by something like 2 or 3x, its a much more capable board, if gaming is your goal, i'd go with the 8600 (other boards to consider: geforce 8600gts, radeon hd 2600pro, radeon hd 2600xt, radeon x1950gt, radeon x1950pro)
