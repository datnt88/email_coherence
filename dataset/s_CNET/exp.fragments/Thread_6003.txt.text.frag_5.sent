you will need to connect to the router through one of the ethernet ports (with a network cable). 
from there you can access the routers features by typing the routers ip address in internet explorer or other browser. 
most have firewalls or a permitted list of mac addresses. 
connect with a cable then read or download the handbook for the router. 
good luck and don't give up, been there, done that, with my first router (motorola).
