yes, it is possible to use the two hard drives in conjunction. 
the thing is though, that sata drives do not have jumpers to set one as master and another as slave. the reason is because each sata drive has its own connection slot, as opposed to a uata drive. 
although i do not have a sata and uata drive in conjunction i believe setting it up should be fairly simple, just plug them in, and off you go.
