i'm not sure if this is the right forum, but bear with me, i'm new here. 
that said, here is my problem: i want to find a wiring diagram for a laptop lcd/tft screen so i can make an adapter to plug it into my graphics card and have a secondary monitor. 
where would i find info on this? 
thanks for any help in advance!
