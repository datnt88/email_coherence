are a big manufacturer of electronic components for computers and other devices. 
theyalso make scanners, motherboards, cdroms, dvd burners, just to name a few. 
however, i cannot find any reference to a scsi board. 
adaptec were always the scsi board of choice for the mac and probably still is. 
they have a 2906 model, part number 1772900, which may be suitable. 
it mentions os x (10.1) but it would be worth the price of a free phone call to find out. the card is $65 p
