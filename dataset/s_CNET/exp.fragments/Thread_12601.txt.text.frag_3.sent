i personally use an ultra external hdd case with a seagate 120gb hdd inside. the external hdd case does not come with a hard drive. 
i had to purchase a separate hard drive for it - chose the seagate 120gb, 7200rpm hard drive because the seagate is more reliable from my experience and the 120gb takes care of all my files. 
this combination was less expensive than any complete unit on the market at the time and it has both usb 2.0 and high speed firewire. 
this ultra has both a usb 2.0 and firewire connections. 
i use it to backup both my office and home machines. 
i purchased it through tigerdirect.com 
for about $50. 
i have used it for a year. 
i would recommend the ultra product to anyone. 
do the research and find what you like.
