i found a utility (flash check v1.08, freebie) on the internet. 
i ran tests on all my flash drives, and all had zero errors except the noname 2gb drive which was giving me trouble. 
this drive gave me about 260 errors! 
this flash check utility seems to be a very handy item. 
if anyone knows of a better checker, please let me know. 
i also observed that the board and usb connector on this troublesome drive is somewhat loose in its case. 
i suspect the following: i have a clock radio next to my bed which permits playing mp3 files stored on a usb flash drive. 
i had used this drive the night before. 
it is quite possible that sometime during the night i hit this drive while it was still plugged into the radio and did it some damage. 
it sticks out like a &quot;sore thumb&quot; and could easily be harmed. the lesson learned: don't leave the flash drive in the machine over night if it is within reach.
