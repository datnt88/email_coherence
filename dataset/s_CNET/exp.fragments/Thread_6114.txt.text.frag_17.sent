bob, as they said earlier in a post. 
i do not think you read the post but just reply. 
i do not know if it is because that is the only answer you can give. 
i just finished stating that the gov. is not who i really care about. 
most people are not doing anything so grave that they are worried about the gov. the riaa and is not the gov. 
they do not have the power to tap lines nor do i believe the gov. 
will give them access to tap because they feel someone is violating them. 
what is with this gov. 
tie up. 
give up the gov. 
comments. 
why do you not comment or give credit to the products full potential and give up the gov. 
hang up. 
forget the whole anonymous thing and let me know what you think about the product as a network device regarding the antivirus,spyware,etc and its ease of use. 
this in my opinion is worth every penny. 
no hassle if my kid antivirus is up to date and the no brainer set is awesome.
