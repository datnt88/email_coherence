i just finished building my pc and everything works; power switch, fans, leds, you name it. 
i connected the monitor to the graphics card using hdmi to dvi respectively, and i get no signal on the monitor. the cpu led is also constantly on red. 
i'm 100% certain the cpu is put in right. 
it is an amd phenom ii x4 3.4ghz. 
is the bios on the motherboard compatible with the cpu? 
do i need a new motherboard? the motherboard and cpu are both socket am3+. 
i'm also using an ssd, which i know is working because of the led inside.
