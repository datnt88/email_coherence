with all due respect, sir. it doesn't matter if it &quot;sounds&quot; like it is the first machine i've built. 
it is not. 
i am just trying to put the point across that i did build my own machines before and that i never experienced this problem before. 
on the other hand, though, i am certainly not a professional.
