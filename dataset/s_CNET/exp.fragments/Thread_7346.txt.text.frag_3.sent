good post above. 
what you are looking for is what is called pxe(&quot;pixie&quot;)-booting. 
this is more than just the protocols on typically consumer nas devices. 
it is possible to do, but you better have a good background in it and ready to spend a good bit of money for products that aren't commonly sold in consumer applications. 
good luck!
