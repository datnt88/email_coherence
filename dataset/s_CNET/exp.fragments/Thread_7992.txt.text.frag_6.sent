you've mentioned practically every cutting-edge pc component, but until you set a budget you won't be able to really decide if x is better than y. for a gamer, the key component is the video card, but an 8800gts can't overcome an underpowered cpu or cramped ram. 
likewise, a strip-set of raptors (raid-0) won't help much if you pair them with a wimpy video card. 
set a budget and then decide what components you can afford. 
if you've only got 1500 to spend, a quad-core is out of the question so you don't need to anguish over one. 
lastly, get the fastest pc you can afford and forget the 'future' unless you plan to build your pc in phases. 
with a phased build you could spend 150 now with the plan to spend another 200 later and wind up with a faster gaming pc going into '08.
