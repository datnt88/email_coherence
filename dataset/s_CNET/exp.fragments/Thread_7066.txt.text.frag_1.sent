i have been looking into getting a wireless g pc card (not the at&t/phone carrier ones, the netgear and linksys ones). 
i know that the pc cards boost your bandwith and help you to get a better internet connection. 
now, i've noticed that these handy gadgets can be very expensive. 
does anybody know a good, not pricey pc card that works great?
