go google &quot;how to overclock&quot; hard part- open up your case somewhere near your processor there will be a silverish thing(about 1 cm in size) next to it is a black thing, copy everything down. 
that will be your pll-stuff easy part- go to your bios and adjust your fsb if you can. 
don't blame me if it frys your computer
