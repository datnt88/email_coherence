so what do you think i should do to help avoid these bugs? 
did i do something wrong when i initialized it? 
or do you think they are inherent bugs with the setup? 
because none of the reviews mentioned anything like this... of course it could also be a failing on my cheap-skate computer itself. 
bad news if this is the case, i will need to get a new comp sooner than later. 
good news, the drive itself should be fine, and when i do get a new comp it should run perfectly.
