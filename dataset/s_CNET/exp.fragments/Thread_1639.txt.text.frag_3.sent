my goal is to replace my current 500 gb external hard drive because it is getting full. 
i feel that 2 tb will be sufficient and i would like any connection type faster than usb 2.0. 
i need this external storage to do 2 things (2 partitions): store time machine backups, and store my large files that would clog up my laptop's hard drive. 
i would like to have raid 1 so that i have a backup for the large files which are only saved on the external storage, in case one external drive failed. 
like i said, i have no experience with raid. 
if you know of another way to accomplish these goals please let me know.
