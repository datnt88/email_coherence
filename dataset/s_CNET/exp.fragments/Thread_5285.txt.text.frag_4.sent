i think you are referring to total system price and not just the cpu price if you were building it yourself. 
of the two i mentioned earlier, the amd cpu costs about twice as much as the intel cpu. 
care to share any details on the systems? 
system model name cpu model video card model amount of ram hint: nobody can tell you which is the ''fastest'' for gaming until you tell us the specific cpu model name. 
amd and intel make many dual core processors. 
hint hint: video card model usually has more to say about how good a gaming machine it will be.
