e6750 is about $205usd compared to $300usd for e6700: go with 2gb right off the bat since it's so inexpensive. 
ocz gold ddr2-800, 2gb kit, $90 before $30 rebate: the asus p5k motherboard series is a good choice as is the gigabyte ga-p35-ds series. 
both have mobos in the $125-$150 range depending on features. 
but if you don't need advanced 3d graphics, this gigabyte ga-g33m-s2 has the latest intel chipset, onboard graphics, the features that most people actually use, and is only $118: hard drive wise, 320gb and 500gb are the 'sweet spots': 250gb: $67 320gb: $75 ($8 for additional 70gb) 400gb: $100 500gb: $108 ($8 for additional 100gb) raid is a matter of preference.
