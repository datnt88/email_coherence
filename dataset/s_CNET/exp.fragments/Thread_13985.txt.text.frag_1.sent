i have two wpn802 (netgear rangemax aps) one acting as a repeater. 
i live in a large(ish) bungalow with many walls and doors from last september (2006) until june 2007 the combination worked very well. the recent summer in ireland was poor. 
lately (august) with an increase in atmospheric high pressure the repeater is having difficulty connecting with the primary ap are there better products on the market now that will enable me to get very good range without being too badly affected by high pressure conditions? 
(netgear wpn802 was a huge advance over my earlier smc products) do i have to revert to a wired solution? 
does the new 802.11n standard help in any way (i am more concerned about range than speed).
