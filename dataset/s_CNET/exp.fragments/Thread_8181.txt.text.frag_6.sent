and in the cnet networking forum we have a lot of fixes collected. 
the firewall always comes up first. 
then we look at changing the dns to a google dns (google google dns) but the clue is not in your posts. it could be there is no dlna server to be found. 
or a windows/antivirus update blocked the server on the pc. the clues are not here. is a long technical reading but the bottomline is this is not consumer friendly today.
