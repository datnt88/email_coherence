my tablet has crashed and died. 
unable to boot. 
black screen, will not power on. 
also, now unable to erase personal financial data and files... backup files accessible wherever i had the tablet. 
tablet crashed within warranty after 9 months. 
acer did ask me to send to a texas repair facility, except will not assure me personal data will not be accessed by repair people. 
advised me to take to local technician! 
then what? the thing does not work! 
anyone out there have any answers to my quandry, any advice? 
think twice when looking at acer.
