on your video card. 
my main pc's video card has a lot of resolution options and i was able to find one that worked. 
my other pc's video card did not have the proper resolution and the screen was stretched. 
a wide screen monitor will need something like 1440 x 900 resolution (wide screen). 
if your video card does not have this available, you'll get a stretched picture.
