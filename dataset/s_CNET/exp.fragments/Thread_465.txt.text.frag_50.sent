i've been lucky i have a friend who steered me in the rite direction off the top. 
he told me pc's are like cars they will all get you there .i was a compaq die hard . 
so i went to the store with a list of what i wanted /needed. 
my first and only computer. 1 gig ram cd-rewrite, dvd player/burner etc but they gave me a bootleg windows os. well now 4 yrs later the only original part is the mobo. 
i've cut holes in the side panel added additional ram, fans & lights recently a new heatsink fan. 
i found out about thermal gel by accident actually purchase some before i needed it, i've learned a lot,just dont ask me to count ram.
