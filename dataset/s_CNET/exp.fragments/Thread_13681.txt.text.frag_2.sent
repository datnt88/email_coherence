1. can they afford $30 for a router? 
less problem 'cuz you won't have to have ics and have it on everytime you want to access internet. 
from the standpoint of remote control, this layout would be a lot easier to work with. 
2. try logmein. 
it's free but you have to install a client application on the the two computers.
