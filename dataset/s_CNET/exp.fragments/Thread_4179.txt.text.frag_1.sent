i am runnning winxp. 
i am trying to format my slave drive. 
i have a win 98 bootdisk floppy . 
i disconnected my primay drive because i did not want to make any mistakes. 
when i run fdisk i get these questions asking if i want to enable large disk support. 
i chose yes. 
but after that it just goes to a black screen with the line just blinking. 
is something wrong with the disk or should i just be more patient.
