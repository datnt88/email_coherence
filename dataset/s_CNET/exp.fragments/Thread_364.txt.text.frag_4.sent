excuse me proffitt and thanks jmarchi, i was really desperate. 
i hope you understand. 
i would be careful in future. 
after posting my message and i immediately reinstalled win 98 after reformatting c: and the printer was visible to os under plug and play after that [before i tried uninstalling the printer but os would nt see it.] but once again when i start printing, printing starts but after printing half a inch of 'test page' it stops. 
message i get is unable to comm- unicate with printer port lpt1. 
i now try other options as suggested by you and report back if something positive comes out. 
i have one more apprehension that it might have something to do with ink refill in my black ink cartridges. 
color is empty. 
i should nt ve gone for refills thanks for your help. 
aron.
