i had a similar problem after fooling around with a pirated nero 9 (may the cyber gods forgive me). 
eventually i had to uninstall it and ended up with a similar problem to yours. 
in checking for a solution i noticed that someone had reinstalled some media programme and solved this problem. 
i decided to reinstall the roxio 9 that came with my dell inspiron and bingo. 
my internal and external dvd/cd burners returned to the fold. 
hope this suggestion is of use to someone. 
gerry donaghy
