i'm a senior, retired, but very atypical, in that i'm a long time computer & smart phone guy. 
i also provide it support for my church and i get this kind of question pretty often. 
like bob, i have a preference for windows and android over apple. 
but if you surveyed the population you're talking about it's probably more iphones & ipads than anything else. 
if that is the case, then i'd say go with apple and let them help each other. 
iphone, ipad, ipad mini, ipod touch offer a consistent experience. 
refurbs, ipad mini, previous generation ipads are all ways to get in at a lower cost. 
on the other hand, kindle and nook are both good tablets, too. 
both offer a curated app store so there are fewer choices, and that's important for people in a retirement village. 
both do wifi and email very competently. 
i prefer the nook line (nook color, nook tablet and the new nook hd and hd+) because they are more open. 
kindle has a strong preference for the amazon ecosystem for books, movies and tv. nook relies more on commercial apps like netflix, hulu, etc. significant differences in the latest offerings are: - kindle has a front facing camera; nook has no camera - kindle's low priced tablets are ad supported, nooks are ad free - nook tablets have a micro sd card slot for added storage, kindles don't have a way to add storage - both nook and kindle highlight their email and calendar apps for what it's worth, the other bob
