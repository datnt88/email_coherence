hello everyone i just got a new computer (i am not a computer pro btw) and it has a agp slot. the problem is i am not to sure to know which one i have. the computer user manual don't tell, neither it says so on the mother board or in the computer periphical section. 
i checked a few sites about agp cards but they made me confuses even more. 
my card is brown and has a key in the middle near the front of the computer. 
i found a site that might be usefull: it looks like the green one model, but it's brown. 
i supose color doesn't mean anything but i just want to be sure before buying any cards. 
let me know please. 
thank you!
