dear bob, my point is that i own and control the asus wl-700ge and would like to use it without any need to make changes on the work laptops. 
i fail to understand what my bona fide quuestion has to do with forum policies. 
since i am using my work laptop via vpn it would be detrimental to mess around its setup in any way. 
i hope someone can help me with this.
