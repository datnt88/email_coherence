so i have two linksys adapters and one netgear. 
all three can see the network, but only one linksys one will connect. 
i tried resetting the router and it still doesnt work. 
according to cnet, this router has great backwords compatibility, which was why we bought it. 
so when i try to connect to the network, it says 'waiting for network to be ready' for like 30 seconds, then it stops trying, so it doesnt even get an ip address. 
however, the one linksys adapter that works connects almost instantly. 
does that help? 
thanks!
