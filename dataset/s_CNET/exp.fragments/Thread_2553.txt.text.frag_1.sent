i have an elderly 10 year old dell 5150 dimension computer.i 
wish to use my 9 year old iomega zip 100 magetic storage drive with this computer, as i had done previously. 
i accessed the information on this website, which instructed me to download/run a program called aro 2012. 
after running this program, i was confronted with instructions to buy this software; i declined. 
there were no further instructions as to installation of the requested drivers. 
was this another internet scam?? i only wish to reinstall the drivers foe my admittedly old component. 
perhaps my attempts are futile. 
there are several websites claiming to offer these drivers. 
can i find a place to simply download these drivers which i purchased previously with this device? 
any input would be appreciated. 
i have looked in many websites.
