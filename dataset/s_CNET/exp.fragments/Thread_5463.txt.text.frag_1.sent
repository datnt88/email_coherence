hi all! 
i'm looking to buy a new desktop computer because right now my laptop keeps over heating and shutting down. 
i tried buying a fan but that didn't help at all. 
i have found 2 desktops that are in my price range and look good. 
i have to run autocad and i want the computer to be good at gaming. 
something that could run battlefield 2, or battlefield 2142, and have it look nice and run great! 
i'm ok with upgrading the video card eventually. 
i really don't know which computer is best from these two. 
here is a side by side comparisent from compusa.com i'm leaning toward the gateway but i've never owned a gateway before, just hp's...i have no idea if there good quality pc's and i really can't tell which is best for my needs- upgradable,gaming, autocad, and have multiple programs open at once! right now my laptop shuts down if i have autocad and windows media player open... i could really use the help, since all of you are smarter at computers than me! 
side by side compared. 
here are the two at bestbuy.com hp gateway thanks again all!
