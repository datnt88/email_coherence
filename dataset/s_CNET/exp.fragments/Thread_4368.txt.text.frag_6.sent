thanks for all the suggestions everyone. 
i actually talked to the man who diagnosed my computer about the fans. 
in his opinion he thinks that what i have now is perfect and the top doesnt need anything extra because the heat already rises out of the case and installing a top exaust may screw up the exaust areas air dynamics where the cpu cooler is spitting air out the back
