i have a ibm aptiva, p2, 350mhz, with a maxtor 10gb hdd. 
when i replaced the 10gb hard drive with a 60gb hard drive, my computer won't boot up. 
i have tried using a boot disk in the floppy drive. 
there is a blinking cursor after i start the computer. 
changing the boot sequence in the system setup has no affect. 
i am still unable to get the computer to read a disk in the floppy drive or the cd rom drive. is there a limit to the drive capacity in the computer? 
my original hard drive is getting ready to fail. 
should i look aroung for a replacement hard drive with the same disk capacity of 10gb? 
thank you for your help.
