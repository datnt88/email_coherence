can i use the cnet cntcua-854 wireless usb 802.11-g ubs dongle to create a hub. 
much like the nintendo usb wifi hub for ds and wii. 
there are others out there like it as well. 
nintendo is no longer selling the one they had and i wanted a better brand name than some of the ones i am seeing. the others allow you to plug it into any pc with an internet connection and it will send out a wifi signal to be picked up by wii/ds/psp/ and other pc's in the home. 
thanks, tina
