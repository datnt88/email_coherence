i just double checked and it says agp slot available. 
as far as the cpu on this machine i guess i was just relating stuff i had read on other forums. 
believe me i'm no expert on computers. 
if i was i wouldn't be asking so many questions. 
lol. 
would you be kind enough to tell me how to check the bios to see if the card can be disabled? 
i have never ventured in there. 
and, thanks for your feedback.
