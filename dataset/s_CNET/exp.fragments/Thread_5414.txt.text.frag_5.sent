just be aware that you will probably notice only a minor difference in performance with all you are talking about doing. 
you are just not changing much that will give you a noticeable boost in performance. 
you are overdoing it with fans, you won't get any extra performance from that and pushing an amd processor is asking for a burnout, no matter what fan you use. 
systems running 3.6ghz p4 processors run just fine and will last for years with a single case fan and a power supply fan. 
if you were to go to scsi then go to the 15,000 rpm drives, not the 10,0000, though now you say you will go sata and that will not really make a major difference in overall performance. 
you would be better off waiting and replacing the whole system with a new faster 64bit processor with a significantly faster ghz rating....shoot for 3ghz or higher to really get a boost in performance. 
also shoot for more cache than 256mb, like the 1gb of the 64bit processor.
