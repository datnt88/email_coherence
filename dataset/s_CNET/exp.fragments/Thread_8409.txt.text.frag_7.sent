what does a laboring disk sound like to you? 
if a disk becomes noisier (louder) as it ages, it can signify impending bearing failure. 
this type of failure is perhaps one of the very few that does give some (audible) warning. 
when you hear bearing noise,it's time for a new drive. 
a stethescope can help to isolate the source of the noise, a failing bearing will have a knock, or ticking quality. 
a good bearing will sound relatively smooth. 
caveat: there can be a 20 decibel difference in noise level from disk to disk, just hearing noise isn't sufficient reason for concern, an increase in noise level is cause for concern.
