haha, the last place i would have looked. 
but the first place i should of. 
i have never had this problem before, i am surprised someone else has. 
i am not at home right now to try to test that. 
i mean i could undersatnd if media player is the default under autoplay to play dvd's but i have the take no action selected. 
thats microsoft tying everything to the os benefits at work for you. 
if i can't get that fixed fairly quickly i am going to just reinstall the os from scratch. it is about time i do that anyway as i have gone through several hardware upgrades and driver revisions. 
so it might be good to start from scratch anyway. 
but i am going to definetely try to figure it out and post what i find. 
thanks for the idea of where the problem could be!
