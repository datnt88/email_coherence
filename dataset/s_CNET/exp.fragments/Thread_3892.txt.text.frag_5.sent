i read through the sticky. the only program i thought would really help was disk warrior, and that's only osx. 
i think that all the data is still there, but i'm just unable to access the drive. 
i have emailed a few local recovery places. 
one question i have though is that i'm getting the impression that there is a difference between storage and backup. 
what works best for each of them? 
thanks.
