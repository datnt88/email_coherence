i have dsl with at&t at home. 
they gave us a modem (2wire logos included) and that is what we use to connect to connect to the internet, no signal amplifiers or anything. 
we pay for the 3 mb/sec plan. 
my question is twofold: one: how would a router play into this and what do routers do differently from modems, and two: if the router increases speed and we only get a certain speed from at&t, how does that work or is the 3 mb/sec bandwidth. 
can someone help explain all of the different parts of a network (and yes, i know what an ethernet cable and wi-fi are). 
thank you!
