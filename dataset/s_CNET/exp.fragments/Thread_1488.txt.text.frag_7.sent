words from you: . 
slightly older laptop . 
has xp . 
upgrading to vista home prem . 
run aero i/f . 
what if aero doesn't work is this an academic exercise or are you spending $100 for frustration to prove that if you got it, flaunt it? 
lots of consumers buying laptops today would give an arm and leg to have xp on it and you are going the other direction? 
is ms giving a better deal for vista to w7 upgrade than xp to w7 that i don't know about?
