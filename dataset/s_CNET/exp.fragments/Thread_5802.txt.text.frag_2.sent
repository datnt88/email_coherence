if i am not mistaken your video card is agp, (if it is) there are still a few agp motherboard out there. 
as far as the memory is concerned it all depends on the motherboard you chose, and if it supports the fastest memory that can go on an agp board (pc 3200). 
(and then there is duel channel memory motherboards). 
move fast there are getting to be less & less agp motherboards out there. 
there are a lot of good brands out there so it is all up to you and your wallet. 
(enjoy your new build) good luck wendell h
