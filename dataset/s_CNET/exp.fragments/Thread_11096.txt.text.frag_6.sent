i've found another fix - i went into device manager and uninstalled my card, i then restarted my laptop and sure enough all is well - zero configuration starts every time. 
a friend suggested this he thought that during the original installation something had gone wrong and zero configuration hadn't been configured correctly. 
by uninstalling in device manager you just remove the cards driver it seeems. 
you learn something new every day!
