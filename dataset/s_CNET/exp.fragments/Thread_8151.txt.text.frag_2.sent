since the pc seems to be ok when you leave it plugged &quot;into the mains&quot;, i would also suspect the power supply or motherboard. 
even though the pc is off, there is still power being supplied to the pc. i have an intel motherboard that started to mis-behave when the power was turned off to the power supply, so have learned how to get around the quirck. 
is there a reason you like to turn &quot;the mains&quot; off? 
btw: since that way of saying it must mean you are not from the usa, i have to assume you mean turning off the place where the pc is plugged in, correct? 
either by unplugging or with a switch to turn off the plug, like a power strip.
