indeed, but when it comes to monitors the best resolution will always be the one native to your display (in my case 1920x1080). 
there are some exceptions such as system resource heavy games. 
if you don't have a powerful enough setup (modern gpu, atleast 4gb memory etc.) the game will perform much better if you lower the res., while keeping the same aspect ratio. 
other than that, always set to native resolution.
