a little more info, please. 
was it a ps 2 mouse? 
have you tried leaving the ps 2 mouse port disconnected and using a usb mouse?? will your system boot up to the first video screen with nothing connected to the mobo except video card, memory, cpu/hsf, the power supply and the front panel connections? 
no mouse, no keyboard?? you may have zapped the i/o chip on the mobo, and possibly the southbridge chip. 
sounds as if you need a new mobo.
