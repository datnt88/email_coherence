i have a new(ish) pc it is 3 years old and i have had problems with it since day one. 
first the psu failed then the mobo. 
lastly i've had three hard disk failures. 
this is not fun at all, currently my comp is down and i need to get it fixed. 
my specs are: intel core 2 duo @ 2.13 ghz, evga 680i, evga 7950gt, 750w psu, original hdd was 250gb seagate sata, current is 750gb seagate sata. the symptoms are recurrent blue screens where it says that it is deleting physical memory. 
then it turns off and turns back on just to get to the windows xp screen (the one with the blue bar) and then go blue screen again. 
i have tried to reinstall windows and that works for a verry short time. 
then the blue screen comes back except this time it turns back on and the blue bar just keeps going across the screen. 
finally i shut it off and when it turns back on it doesn't even go to the windows screen cause it goes to the one where &quot;windows encountered an error and the start with safe mode (with or with out networking) pops up. 
lastly it does nothing and i turn it off till i can get a new hdd. 
thank you for all your help.
