hello, i wonder if anyone can help me with this. 
i have an old dell optiplex 170l (service tag dmz491j) on which i've just reinstalled windows xp on. 
i would also like to upgarde the processor on it as at the moment its only a celeron 2.6. 
i have done a little research but just need someone elses experienced confirmation. 
i have found one of these for sale: i think that will work according to dells web site. 
i also would need a little advice on the memory as i'm sure i'll need to change it. 
currently it is running pc2700u-25330 333mhz cl2.5. 
what would i need to change the memory to? 
thankyou for your assistance
