i opened up the case and looked for anything obvious that was possibly interferring with the fan and didn't see anything. 
blew out a good amount of dust from the heat sink fan. 
both that and the fan in the power supply rotated from the canned air, but i will have my brother inspect them as he knows more about this than i do. 
i am going to assume you are meaning to check them while the computer is running, so i will crack her open again to see how both of them look. 
i know that some air was coming from the fan in the power supply when it was on, but perhaps it's not up at the correct speed.
