the simplist solution is to just drop dhcp and hardcode the ip address all around. 
use the same ip, gateway, dns entries and change the netmask to 255.255.0.0 and it will work fine with internet traffic still going to each respective dsl and cable box. 
if this isn't a solution for you, then you will have loads of fun with net route commands and another (real) router. 
but i won't be doing that because it's too much for this small space.
