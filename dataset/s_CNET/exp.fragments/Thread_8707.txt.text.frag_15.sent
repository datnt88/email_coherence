sorry i haven't gotten back sooner about this tanzangel777, meant to post after i saw that you responded, but didn't have the time, then i forgot all about it. 
problem with getting older! 
i still haven't gotten the c711 series, but hope to do so sometime in april or may of this year. 
as far as printing on metalic or vellum, i don't know if it can. 
i'd try and contact them directly.
