sorry i missed it out. 
my desktop is 2 1/2 years old, and runs xp sp1 - i was put off by all the probs with upgrading - maybe that is not such a problem now? the new notebook runs sp2. 
i have btw found an answer on another forum found out how i can swith the print spooler off. 
i am still, however having major problems, in that neither computer is seeing each other, despite each being able to connect to the internet. 
i will try again later......
