hi big steve, i see you are concerned about your new computer's security especially since you recently posted the other day: steven haninger is an excellent computer tech and has given good advice along with others, but since you have made two different threads showing your concern, may i suggest you post in the virus & security alerts forum. 
there are many experts there just waiting for someone concerned like you to post. 
as for myself, on my best desktop (winxp sp2), i have nortons systems works (it has the antivirus included along with other great stuff), and two free spyware detection programs (adaware & spybot), and the new beta microsoft anti-spyware (currently free until around july). 
i have the firewall in winxp sp2 disabled to use the free zone alarm firewall as it gives coverage on the in and out. 
on my other computers i use the free avast antivirus program instead of the free avg, free spyware (adaware & spybot) and the free zone alarm firewall. 
regards,
