has anyone used dban, how long does it take to wipe your hardrive? 
(please specify capacity etc). 
reason i'm asking is because the airport in my country normally checks all computers. 
i don't have anything immoral, only some pirated software (and the airport here makes issues and fines about that). 
i simply cannot afford to buy software!! so my plan is to launch dban when the authouraties decided to check my computer? 
do you think this could work in time? 
please advise. 
thanks dean
