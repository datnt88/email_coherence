i have had no problem with the video cards that i have used, however, i was going to purchase the ati tv wonder elite to use for video capture. 
but, that was before reading all the reviews and how disgusted people that have actually used the card have been. 
i do realize that the only way you can make a true decision is to purchase &quot;said&quot; merchandise and experiment for yourself which can become expensive and time consuming. the below review is a good one that tells how ati has compromised in the software area on the tv wonder elite with the theater 550 chip, hopefully it will improve.
