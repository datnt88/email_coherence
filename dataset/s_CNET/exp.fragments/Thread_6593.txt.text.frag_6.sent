no steve, i'm sorry. 
i don't know for sure that xps support is based in the us. 
i was told that through a rep i spoke with in alabama so i would say that yes, buying through a business account would probably be best if your main concern is support. 
but be aware, dell does not offer the &quot;deals&quot; they offer through their home unit on most business purchases. 
sure, you can still get a pretty good deal if you watch the sales, but i have found (though i can't say all the time, or that i really pay that much attention to it unless i'm in the market for something) that the home prices are usually better - or you get something better with your purchase. 
i recently bought a media center pc (decent upgrades, but nothing crazy - i'd rather upgrade it myself later anyway) for my home for less than $850 including tax, shipping, etc. and i got a free 19&quot; monitor. the same configuration from dell small business was over $900 without the monitor.
