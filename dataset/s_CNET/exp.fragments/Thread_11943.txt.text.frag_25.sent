and hope you understand that i don't want to upset folk as we work networking issues. 
there's a lot to go over and something is blocking the shares. 
i forgot something. 
sorry. 
after some of those changes we have to reboot. 
again, xp is quite an old system and may not tell you need to do that. 
let's work the clue about the access to the computer. 
that is. 
&quot; \home is not accessible. 
you might not have permission to use this network resource. 
contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. 
access denied&quot;. 
this is almost always the accounts issue. 
you see a lot of folk try to network with guest, limited user accounts or accounts that don't match up across the pcs and end up with no network. 
again, if i am to access \home, i must have an account there that matches the machine i'm logged into. 
so if i'm bob here i must have a bob account on the other pc. 
-&gt; yes you could enable guest access if you want to forget all that. 
your choice on that. 
bob
