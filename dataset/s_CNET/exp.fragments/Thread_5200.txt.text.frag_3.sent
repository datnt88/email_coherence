that gives more reason to improve other components, but with things like the air, you are trying to get a package that is too small for current technology. 
and with that, you still make a lot of compromises. 
sure 1.6 or 1.8ghz is pretty good for an ultraportable, but if you're using leopard, you may think otherwise. 
this concept won't advance for awhile, unless intel really does a good job with the new atom cpus. 
smaller processors will go a long way in ultraportables, no? -bmf
