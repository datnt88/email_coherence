i am running winxp prof and have sp2 installed. 
i purchased a belkin 802.11g wireless card for the desktop but it is not recognized as a device. 
i tried to search for new hardware and no luck. 
can this be a sp2 problem? 
i know the slots are working because it will recognize other cards. 
(nic and sound card). 
i also know the wireless card works because i installed in another machine and it detected. 
the only thing was the 2nd machine was a dell without sp2 installed. 
any help would be appreciated.
