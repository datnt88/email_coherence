thank you bob. it has hardware version b2 and firmware version v1.18. 
i had a brief look at the advanced settings but see nothing about networking. 
i do see, though, that in a couple of those links, it says &quot; ... sometimes even the windows firewall has to be told that you have a new trusted device on the network.&quot; 
ok, how do i tell that to my firewall? 
oh, by the way, i noticed that in their description of it they say that it has a &quot;non-detachable diversity antenna&quot;. 
yes, it's not detachable, but since it's on its own it ceratinaly ain't one of two or more antennas which are necessary for (space) diversity reception. 
i wonder where some of these people get their ideas from?
