i understand the processing power will be greater but how about the price range? 
(price maximum of $300) what speeds do they operate at? 
do you know where i can find information on this product? 
also what kind of motherboards will support this dual core? 
another question unrelated to cpus, do you suggest that i buy a pci express motherboard and gcard? 
i'm leaning toward agp 8x because of its value but i'm not sure of the agps longevity.
