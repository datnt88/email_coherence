i pulled the old ram out, assuming it had 2 sticks of 256 because it showed in bios as only 1/2 gig, to my surprise it had 2 sticks of 512. 
i put the new sticks of 1 gig each in and it is only recognizing 1 gig and single channel, can anyone shed some light on how to get this motherboard to recognize both gig and as dual channel? 
thanks!
