if you want to leave it open, i.e. w/o pw, go into the router and set the broadcast power to 10%. 
this usually enough for one room and has little or no leakage. 
turn it up 5% at a time until you have no complaints. 
ideally the router sit in the middle of the room. 
if you have more than one room put it in the doorway between them or the wall between them. 
if the router must be on an outside wall then put tin-foil behind it to block the signal to outside. 
i do hope you have two system in your pub? one for business and one for customers.
