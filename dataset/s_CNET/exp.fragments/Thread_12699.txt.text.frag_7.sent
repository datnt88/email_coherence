did i mention, firewire. 
ok, i went back and reread your original post. 
i will accept that your roxio cd, the one with toast on it, is defective. 
your mac is an older g3 imac and does not have usb 2.0 ports on it, only usb1. 
this really is not fast enough to be burning cd's with, especially if the burner can burn at a decent speed. 
there is also the possibility that the lite-on usb interface is not backwards compatible with usb1 and is therefore not recognised, as a burner, by your mac. this device will almost certainly work if you purchase a firewire cable for it. 
again, firewire is the connection of choice with a mac. 
if you purchased the device from someone who told you it was working with a mac, then they almost certainly had it connected with a firewire cable. 
please, no waffle about firewire cables being expensive in the uk. check this out and tell me if you consider one penny to be expensive. 
check out the online stores for other pricing.
