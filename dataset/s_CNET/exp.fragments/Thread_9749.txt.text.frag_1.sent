i am having a problem with my wintv-pvr-250 tuner card, has any one seen this kind of problem? 
think it maybe hardware. 
no error message just distortion in the live tv. 
sometimes its vertical lines and sometimes its horizontal lines. 
i have updated wintv pvr-250 software and drivers all the way through too wintv 6 and have the same problem. 
thanks kirkwa1
