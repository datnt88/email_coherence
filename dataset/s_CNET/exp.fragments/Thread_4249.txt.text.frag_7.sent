this is my second r3000. 
i bought one about 6 months ago and then a new one 2 days ago. 
from what i can see in the system information (sandra), it looks like the broadcom chips are different. the first r3000 has worked perfectly since i got it. 
i'm expecting a call from hp tech support around 4pm today, so we'll see if the tech knows what's talking about. 
i was suspecting a bad wireless card until i found the posting from mike and talked to tech support. 
i'll keep you informed.
