hi, so the power supply no problem, good to know, thanks! 
i play wow also and will be using it with this same machine. 
i will add 1gb of ram, for a total of 1.5gb. 
i am wondering though, have you upgraded the ram, if so what did you add, please? 
i saw your previous posts that you included a link for the 2x512mb sticks, did you get those and add them then and still you get some problems like you described? 
i would not be happy i think, especially since i will only be getting a 6600gt or x700pro. 
can't really afford the one you have. 
i will just not be able to play on full settings i guess. 
more ram wouldn't help i don't think. 
btw i have read ati does crappy on doom3 as well. 
thanks, seaninwa
