hi melati, when i plug in the airport express unit i always get the flashing yellow light which means that its out of range or something's not right. 
anyway when i run the airport express assistant it says that it can't find an existing network. 
this is weird since on my pc there clearly is a network yet it doesn't show up on the mac. 
i'm puzzled as the manual is no help at all. 
ta.
