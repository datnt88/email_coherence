where do you find what cpu's are compatible with an asus board? 
i know on the asus website but where? 
anyway i'm just trying to find out if a pentium d925 is compatible with an asus p5wd2 premium. 
i think it is but i'm not 100%. 
plus what do you think about that processor as an upgrade for that board as from a single core. 
i would also like to find out what the maximum processor is that i can put in there is, within financial reason. 
of course that changes with time so i would like to find the list of all the processors that go in there so i can watch as the prices drop. 
thanks jw
