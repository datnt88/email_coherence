i had a similar problem with the same card, turned out it was the fan on the card was bad. 
in the beginning it did whar your did, then the fan totally died. 
had to rma the board. 
my experience leans towards a heat issue somewhere in the system. 
first place i would look is the card. 
i have opened the side a put a big fan on it to see if it solves the problem.
