the problem could lay on the fact that you need user accounts set in both computers. 
this is for networking authentication reasons. 
try this: go to computer a and set up a user. 
to do this go to control panel and select user accounts and then create a new user. the user name being &lt;xxxx&gt; and password being &lt;yyyy&gt;. 
then go to computer b and repeat the same step as in computer a. the user name and password must be the same in both computers, so be carefull so you dont mistype it. 
after this has been completed restart both computers and try to connect to each other through windows explorer. 
remember the workgroup name should be the same in both computers. 
let me know if it works or if you have any other problems.
