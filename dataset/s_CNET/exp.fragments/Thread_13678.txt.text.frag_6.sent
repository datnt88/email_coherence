windows 2000 professional sp4. 
dad may consider an upgrade to xp, but i don't know when/if (within the next year or so) that'll happen. 
so with the software and hardware (plus an add-on adapter card (all we have now is usb 1) that we currently have, should i try sata/esata? 
and how much slower is usb 2 than internal ide?
