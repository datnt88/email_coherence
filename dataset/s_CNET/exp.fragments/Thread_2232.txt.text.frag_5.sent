i'm sorry fellows,i forgot to thank my namesake michael for the advice but i didn't do it because i knew that the problem with my peripheral wasn't physical it was a software thing i knew it, in fact i just installed some dvds utilities and my dvd works fine with both soundtracks, please don't tell me of alan, i forgot to include that i have windows 2003 server standard edition and so on. 
but i'll inlcude this kind of information every other time that i need some advice or help. 
thank you both guys, for your time, for your advices. 
this community rocks, computer science rocks, the internet rocks. 
thx.
