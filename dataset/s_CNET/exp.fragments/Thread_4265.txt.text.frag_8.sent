hi all new to this site. 
i am having a problem when i am shutting down. 
i run win xp, ecs 939pin mb, amd athlon 64x2 3800+, 1 gig mem, i get the following (card reader lookup window) i have to end process before i can shutdown. 
also the comp just came back from repair; i notified them they were no help. 
as i did have an evga mb 939pin that was better than the one they replaced it with, that went bad after only 10 months. 
i am not satisfied with the work they did. 
i got the unit back, they said they tested it, the hd power cable was off & the hd's were switched. 
how could they have tested it? 
sorry just venting. 
any help would be great. 
than you mike.
