it's difficult to say what to do from here. 
i would check for simple things such as loose wires and bad capacitors, especially on the motherboard. 
also, make sure that everything is seated properly on the motherboard. 
next, consider where your computer is located: is it in a desk or a very warm room (or both)? 
computers don't like heat! 
also, make sure it is physically clean internally and stays clean. 
in addition, ensure that it is away from any high powered devices (microwaves, tube tv's etc). 
if all of this has already been done and it checks out ok, it's hard to say what is causing the issue! 
i hope this helps.
