allow me to add to what robert has mentioned. 
i believe the problem to be, &quot;twofold&quot;. 
now, that you've replaced the power supply, the mtrbd. 
fault was finally finished and it may have taken the new p/s with it. 
or the p/s was bad to begin with and took the final stage of the mtrbd. 
along with it. 
what happens to you is common, especially with power problems. 
if it is a bad cap, then unless you're willing to repair and hope for the best, i suggest to move on and get a mtrbd. 
replacement. the 1ghz amd cpu was very demanding and to keep it may not be cost effective in the long run. 
sorry, but that's imho more trouble than its worth, because now you ned to fix the mtrbd.(caps?) and buy yet another p/s to continue on. 
good luck -----willy
