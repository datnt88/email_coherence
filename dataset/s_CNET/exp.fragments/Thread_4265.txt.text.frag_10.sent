other forums indicate that this may be due to a memory card in your printer or memory stick in your computer. 
if you click on safely remove hardware before exiting (& select said memory card/stick), it'll go away. 
i suspect that whether or not the memory card/stick is in place when you turn on the computer has a bearing on this. 
i'm amused by this because i thought it was something to do with the card reader software (very old dos program) which i continued to use until very recently as i had a load of contact details which only it could read. 
i haven't used it for 3 months so i was amazed to keep getting this message - anyway, i think i understand now. 
it's just another example of micosoft's incompetence.
