i have a theory on this. are you running sql 2000 desktop engine (msde)? 
if so, it could be infected with a slammer variant. 
if you think this is the cause, go to office update and they have a critical update patch for this very thing. 
just when you thought slammer was a thing of the past ...lol let me know if this helps.
