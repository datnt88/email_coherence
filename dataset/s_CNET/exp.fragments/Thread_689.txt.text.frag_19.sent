bought the 9400fax in jan. 
by may it's not working and won't accept ink. 
i researched and found this to be a typical problem with epson printers. 
no fix for it. 
i shipped back at epson expense in the original box with everything it came with. 
what do i get in return? 
a printer in a plain box with no power cord, no manual, no original photo paper. 
just ink. it doesn't even appear to be a new printer but one that was either remanufactured or repaired. 
i'm online now trying to get the items required to just run the damn thing. 
they suck!!!!
