word is not a typesetter. 
be sure you have that clear or you will become frustrated. 
a typesetter such as pagemaker and it's ilk sets the letters and pictures exactly on the page regardless of the printer. 
word does the opposite and takes the capabilities of the video display and the printer driver and reformats the document according to rules we don't exactly know about. 
a common problem is that some font may exist on one machine and may not on the other. 
word will substitute one for another and you won't see the same output. 
the pdf end run helps to mitigate these issues.
