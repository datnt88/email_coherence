i have had the same problems with u3 as you. 
i found that the u3 versions below 1.4 do not work on vista. 
i do alot of work on computers at school and i have had problems running between win 2000, xp, and vista. 
i really would like to update my u3 software. 
if any one finds a site i can do that please inform me at animal0307@yahoo.com thank you.
