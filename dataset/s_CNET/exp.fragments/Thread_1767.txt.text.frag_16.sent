but for future reference i had a little trouble with my video drivers too when i first got my card. 
and the thing that seemed to work best for me was to let windows update provide the drivers for my card. 
when you go to windows update, instead of the express button hit the custom button and when its done searching it'll show you windows provided drivers to install as optional. 
i've always found that the drivers provided by windows always seem to work better than the ones from the card manufacturer. 
the card manufacturers always stick in these fancy programs that do nothing but slow you down and mess you up. 
but the windows drivers are just the basic drivers.
