i went to my win 2000 laptop's &quot;network and dialup connections&quot;, opened up the x'd out &quot;local area connection&quot; (is that correct? 
there was another &quot;home&quot; network icon that when i clicked asked for user name and passwordand wouldn't connect) then highlighted internet portocol tcp/ip, clicked on &quot;properties&quot;, typed in ip address i found on my xp desktop 192.169.2.1, submask 255.255.255.0 dns server 192.168.254.254. 
still no luck connecting, i'm sure it has something to do with he previous server and it's probably something fairly simple but i can't figure it out.
