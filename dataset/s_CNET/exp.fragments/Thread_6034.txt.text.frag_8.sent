thank you both for your input. 
bob i appreciate the heads up about becoming &quot;tech support&quot; for the little buggers, i will forward your information to our companies tech support and let them add there input if we decide on flash drives. 
willy, there are many reasons why we chose flash drive over cd/dvd, this gives our client a flash drive that they can continue to use with our companies logo intact, also the information on it can be &quot;locked&quot; onto the drive or we can allow the client to erase our information. 
cd/dvd would arrive at our clients office , they &quot;may&quot; possible review the cd once and then it would get lost in the office shuffle or in the recycle bin. 
in our case a flash drive seems like the logical idea. 
again, i'm really trying to find someone out there that travels with his own flash drive back and forth from europe or asia to the us and can verify his flash drive works in the country's pc and mac based machines.
