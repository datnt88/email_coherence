you data is all on the boot drive, under &quot;users&quot;. 
your pagefile.sys 
(hidden) should be moved onto all three partitions. 
boot partition: 512 mb, data: 1024 mb, and the backup partition should let windows decide. 
don't use windows backup. 
i use cobian (freeware), but might look at others too. 
in window, there is a lot of rubbish. 
get a linux boot-cd, remove adobe (use foxit), games, lanuages you don't use, norton or whatever other firewalls/ anti-virus you have. 
put your &quot;program files&quot; folder onto drive data, use a good registry/ operating system cleaner (&quot;advanced system care&quot;). 
get a &quot;chkdsk /f&quot; to remove any partition & disk faults on all your drives. 
if you can, use ntfs (not fat32) on all your drives; self-healing, less waste space. 
on my bott drive, i ntfs-compress every folder on the drive. 
but do not ntfs-compress the files on the boot drive; only the folders.
