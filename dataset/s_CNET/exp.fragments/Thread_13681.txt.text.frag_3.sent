just today i saw a few go across freecycle. 
so it appears there are a glut of routers making the rounds. 
so price may not be the issue since freecycle things are free. 
i will not help with your ics routing issues. 
no offense but it's not a supportable position. 
but i will tell you that for the second hop you may want to tinker with vnc (see google.) bob
