my system specs are: asus motherboard p3 @ 700mhz 512mb pc133 ram asus sound card samsung cdr/w dvd rom drive bfg tech 256mb 8x agp asylum edition video card windows xp pro the problem is when i go to play some games it freezes when it switches to fullscreen mode. 
this only happens on most of my games, i have newest video card drivers. 
also have newest version of direct x, my agp slot is 2x but the video card is compatible to that. 
i thought it might be power supply but how do i know for sure? 
thanks for the help
