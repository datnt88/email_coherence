absolutely agree with the short life from epson printers. 
i have had 4 r300s fail, due to faulty pc boards,in two years and told that all were uneconomical to repair. 
epson were polite but absolutely useless at coming up with any repacement help. 
as for paying the ridiculious price of their cartridges when i obtain the same results for a tenth of their price, they must think we were born yesterday. 
stick to tank feed systems which have no sponge in the cartridges.
