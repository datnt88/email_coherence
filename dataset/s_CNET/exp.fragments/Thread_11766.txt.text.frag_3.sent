i'm getting the packet information from the local area connection. 
double click on the computer in the lower right corner and you should get the network connection you will see the activity with the number of sent and recieved packets. 
i have always had more received packets than sent but fully understand that the sent could exceed the recieved. 
however there is no way i'm sending 4 billion packets and receiving 2000. 
something is wrong here and i believe it is with sp3 however i monitor my packet size to ensure no one has hijacked my system.
