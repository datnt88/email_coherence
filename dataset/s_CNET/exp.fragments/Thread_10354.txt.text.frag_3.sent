like it's an ata enclosure which has a chipset plus an sata to ide converter. 
all things considered, might be better to get an sata enclosure....no adapter required or an ata ide drive and enclosure and not have to pay the premium for sata to ide converter. 
vapcmd ps...like your response to question one !
