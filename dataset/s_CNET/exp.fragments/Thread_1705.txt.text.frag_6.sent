i'm beginning to wonder if there is a setup issue. 
that is, i can't tell if the modem is just a modem or one of those combo modem+router things. 
if it's the combo deal setup needs to be checked. 
i see a diagram but no words on settings. 
also only a few part numbers so i can't check it out. 
if the modem is the usual, you no longer plug it into the wan or internet port of the router. 
but i'm getting ahead of myself. 
-&gt; as to the basement, my brother and the office will not warrant any router in the basement work. 
you know why.
