same thing happened to me. 
i deleted the account that i made at home and redid it when i was on another wifi network at work. it worked ever since. 
however when i go home it won't update. 
i deleted the account again and tried to rejoin but it does the same thing it did before. 
i will redo the account t work again on monday. 
this tells me the issue is with my cable router (motorola sbg900). 
perhaps a port or something.
