i have an epson workforce 600, which i like very much, but i suddenly have a problem. 
i can't print anything off of the internet. 
i can print normal email and documents that i've saved. 
i tried to print airline confirmation that came with my email message, and all i got was blank pages that rolled through the printer. 
i just attempted to print some movie theater info off the internet, and the same thing happened. 
i can't find any information in my epson booklet about this kind of problem. 
i just downloaded a new driver, but that didn't help. 
can someone please help me?
