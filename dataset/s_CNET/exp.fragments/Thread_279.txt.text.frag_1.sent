i have a few network cables that transmit at a very slow rate. 
if i replace the cables with other ones the network goes fast. 
could it be... the slow cables are not in the 568-b nor in the 568-a order. 
they are crimped the same on both ends though. 
example. 
orange white/orange green white/green brown white/brown blue white/blue the reason i came to this conclusion is the &quot;pairs&quot; are twisted, and if if the network has to transmit along the wrong pair could the be interferance of something? 
can anyone explain.
