if you have a computer without an agp slot, a pci slot video card is probably going to be a lot better than your onboad graphics. 
you at the least will not be sharing system memory to run your graphics and can get directx 9 if your onboard doesn't support it, 2 very good reasons to use a video card. 
if you have a phone modem, a sound card and or an ethernet card(s)in your other pci slots you'll be sharing the limited bandwidth with them. 
so if any of these other cards can be taken out, if, say your on-board sound is ok for your listening needs, and or your phone modem or ethernet card can be removed and on board used instead (if your motherboard has what you need) then you will have even more bandwidth for your video and it will be better. 
as was suggested, the nvidia 5700le is about the &quot;best&quot; pci card available...try to find one with 256 mb. of ram if you can,but 128 mb cards are easier to find and i think in radeon the 9250 is about as high as you can go with pci still have direct x 9 with it, (several other cards have it also, check their specifications, but you're better off with a card that supports it)also be careful, some of these cards don't list being compatible with win98 or winme if you have it running on those computers. the 4x agp slot in your other computer can be used to run some of the later cards out as long as they are able to be &quot;backward&quot; compatible from 8x to 4x....i think most are. 
just be aware some of the higher end cards require a separate power connection to the agp card so make sure you have one and your power supply is capable of running it...i'm not sure, but i don't think you'll gain much going with a higher end card that requires a power connection though on a 4x agp slot, i could be wrong, but it being only 4x might be a bottle neck. 
you'll probably need external power for anything higher than the nvidia 5700 series and radeon 9600 series, and higher may be &quot;overkill&quot; for a agp 4x slot. 
i hope my information is for the most part correct and helps you! it can be a little complicated and confusing, but i think you can upgrade all of your machines if you do some checking....that egg place..lol can't advetise has probably the best deals, tiger has some good deals too, and i'm sure some other sites do also. 
good luck and i hope this helps you.
