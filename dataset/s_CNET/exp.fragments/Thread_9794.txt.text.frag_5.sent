i went to start, run and typed in config and hit enter. the black box opens and closes as fast as the blink of the eye. 
it did the same thing when i did start, run and typed in ping. 
what does this mean? 
i know this means something because that box should open and give me the information i'm asking for not open and close in a split second. 
thanks again, renee
