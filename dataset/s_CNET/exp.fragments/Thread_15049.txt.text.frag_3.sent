i think i made a mistake in doing that. 
i know i can get a replacement for this monitor, just concerned about all the bad press on it. 
really has me thinking, hp had to replace my first computer and the one i have now is it. 
it has been good so far, and only messes up, when i do it. 
i really do love my computer, as it is about all i have to do anymore. 
any ideas about the focus problem? 
thanks, nicekitty
