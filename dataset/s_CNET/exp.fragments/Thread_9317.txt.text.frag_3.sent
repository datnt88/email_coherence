hello! we order our cable from a great company called deepsurplus.com 
along with the jacks that we use for our business. it is about 44.00 for 1000'. 
make sure you order cat5e not just cat5 whoever you order from. 
you can also buy cat5e by the foot, or a 500' box from home depot for about 40.00, 1000' for 55.00. the jacks are pricey--about 5.00 ea., or 30.00 for 10 at the depot. 
cheaper at the surplus and the delivery time with the company is great. 
good luck on your project, and remember to keep your cable away from all your electrical lines when running it.
