hi i'm really just looking for something better than what i have and not insanely pricey, but i am looking for something good. the graphics card that i have now is a sapphire radeon x1550 64-bit 256m and something better, i just don't know what would be good. 
i basically use 3d art design software like daz 3d and photoshop, also i watch a good amount of video. 
not much gaming involved but it can happen. 
if you have any advice on how i can make my pc better please let me know. 
computer specs: motherboard name
