my granddaughter has a older compaq 7000 computer and has lost the use of both the cd and dvd drives. 
i went into devise manager and they both have the yellow exclamation sign. 
i uninstalled both of them and added them again in add new equipment that didn't work. 
i removed them and did a restart that didn't help. 
i took the side off and checked to make sure the ide cable wasn't loose all is well there. 
i removed the drives and installed a couple i had from a old computer along with a new cable and get the same thing. 
i changed the jumpers to cs, slave/master and that doesn't do any good. it shows all the drives in bios when i use detect drives and exit command. 
any help would be very much appreciated. 
thanks wayne
