the first question you need to ask yourself is : q - what changed(no matter how seemingly minor) after i(you) installed the driver initially and it was working fine?? typically it will be here that you will find the answer to the issue. 
my first area of interest would be the fixes(enhancements) you installed from microsoft. 
have you - subsequent to installing the agp card - installed/updated the xp 'miniport' driver. 
or ........ did you install the fix ms09-65: vulnerabilities in windows kernel-mode drivers....etc.. if so there is a statement here : now although the statement only mentions hd 2400 series this does not mean that it is only this series which is affected. 
it merely means that this is the only series they have looked into. 
all ati/radeon 'hd' cards could quite possibly be similarly affected/vulnerable. it is fairly common that if a microsoft update disrupts one or more of your drivers 'post' an update, and you attempt to correct the issue, by updating to a newer driver/package(in your case the hd3850) will not resolve the problem. 
often the only course of action is to remove the whole product(via 'add/remove programmes), and re-installing.
