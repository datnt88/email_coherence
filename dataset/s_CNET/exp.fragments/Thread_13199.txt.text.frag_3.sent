i like to add to what robert mentioned, if you have a build-in nic, buy a nic card then install it. 
just disable the build-in nic before so. 
it's easier to replace and as it was called a bad unit, it pretty much suggests what problem you had before as that's your link to the outside world. 
rerun the test after the install and check results.
