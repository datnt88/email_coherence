thanks for your replies. 
i've been researching some information about upgrading for the past hour or so. it does seem like getting a new case is the way to go. 
what level of a psu do i need? 
400 watts? 
450? 
i will probably install a p4 3.0 ghz. is getting too high of a wattage bad? 
for example, if i only needed 350, is using a 450 bad in anyway (other than a few wasted bucks)? 
thanks again
