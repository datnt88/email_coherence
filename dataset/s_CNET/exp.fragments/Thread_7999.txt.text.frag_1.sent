i recently purchased one more stick of mushkin sp3200 512mb 184-pin ddr sdram to add to the two that i already had. 
my motherboard is a chaintech znf3-250 that supports up to 2 gigs of ram with 3 slots, but when i insert the new stick and boot up the pc it stays on the startup screen. 
it shows &quot;memory testing: 1572864k , memory frequency is: [blank]&quot;. 
i'm not much of a hardware troubleshooting person so i have no idea what to do. 
please help.
