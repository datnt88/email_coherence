(my pc is getting more worthless every day. 
its an hp,with windows xp professional & an intel pentium 4 processor,it says it has 256 mb or ram but that might be wrong. 
the pc had a lot of problems and everytime we went it to get fixed it worked well for a short while then got even worse. 
i also suspect that the people who &quot;fixed&quot; it used a fake/false copy of windows because recently when i checked on the microsoft site, it wasn't a genuine copy. 
at first we said we would order a new copy but now we're thinking of just buying a new computer. 
i really don't feel...right using a fake copy after we've spent so much money buying and &quot;repairing&quot; this pc i am a little fed up.) --i like music and videos and i want a fast pc that has a lot of memory. 
can anyone help me?
