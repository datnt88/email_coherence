i've just been told i've won a new mac mini, with the intel solo core (hooray!) but i will be needing a display, with speakers. 
apple monitors are out of my price range. 
any suggestions/recommendations are welcome. 
i currently have an emac, running 10.3.9, and will be selling it with a year left on the apple protection plan.
