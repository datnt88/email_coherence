i've been reading your comments. 
i have the same problem. 
worked great on win98se. 
totally sucks on xp. i still have a laptop with win98se on it and when i connect it to that it works just like it had good sense. 
this uses a twain driver. 
how much difference is there between win 98se and winxp concerning twain drivers? 
any way the scanner is not broken. 
it just won't run on xp. well that's my take on it anyway.
