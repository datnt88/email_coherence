back in the old days when i had dial up, i was browsing my computer settings when i came across a button that said &quot;remove modem&quot;. 
thinking that the modem was a piece of hardware that couldn't be deleted, i clicked it, and was then unable to get on the internet. 
so i had to restore my computer.
