my troubles are also quite similar to some of thse posts, one in particular where xp would freeze at the black &quot;windows xp&quot; screen at startup. 
my configuration is as follows: intel p4d; intel chipset/mobo; 1 - seagate barracuda 7200 rpm 320gb sata drive --&gt; this is my main os drive {connected to sata 0} 2 - 300 gb maxtor ide drive {connected to sata 1} 3 - 200 gb maxtor ide drive {connected to sata 3} i have a sata adapter on the 2 ide drives, hence their connection to the sata ports on the mobo. 
i have 2 dvd drives on the ide cable. 
i have ensured that with the sata adapter on the ide drives, the jumper settings on the ide drives are all set to master. 
prior settings of the jumpers to &quot;slave&quot; would result in no boot screen at all upon powering on. 
that mistake recognized and rectified, i still cannot figure out why xp won't load under my current setting. the bios settings have been set so that sata 0 is the drive to boot from (the true sata drive). 
in the bios, the system is recognizing the other hdd's connected to sata 1 and 2 without a problem. 
sata 1 has my old image on it (also xp), and when i set sata 1 as the drive to boot from, i get the same problem of windows freezing at the black &quot;windows xp logo&quot; start up screen. 
anyone know how to overcome this? 
thanks.
