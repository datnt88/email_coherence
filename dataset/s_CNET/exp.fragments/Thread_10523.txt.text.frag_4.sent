pc mfg ... with the series and model number you have? 
if i understand correctly, you have 1gb of system ram with 128mbs used for video ram which is minimally sufficient to run your pc efficiently. 
adding more system ram ... for a total of 2gb or 4gb would make the system run significantly better. 
what are you using the pc for ? 
if games, you really need a distinct (vice integrated) video card with it's own ram.
