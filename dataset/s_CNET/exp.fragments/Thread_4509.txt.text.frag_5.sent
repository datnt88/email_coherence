i just contacted hp/compaq support yesterday, and they said they were going to offer a bios update that will enable users with motherboards capable to upgrade to em64t processors to upgrade. 
when this comes out, i'll update the processor to 64-bit. 
unfortunately, i doubt compaq/hp will offer free processors, so you still have to get money out of your own pocket. 
but this is better than getting a new machine. 
quoted technician &quot;yes, sure it will be released in future. 
research is being carried out to check it workability. 
i will forward your messages to our research engineers and do my best to fasten the process.&quot;
