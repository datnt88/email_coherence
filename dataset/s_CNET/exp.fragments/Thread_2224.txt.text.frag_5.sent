i recently bought a lacie 80gb external usb 2.0 drive from buy.com for $85 and have been pleasantly surpised with its quality and performance. 
if you have windows xp it is just plug and play. it has a fat32 format but can be reformatted to ntfs in about 20 mins. 
also, it has an off/on switch which is convenient. 
all documentation (manual) is on the cd.
