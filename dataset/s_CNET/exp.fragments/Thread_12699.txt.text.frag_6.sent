hi, thanks. the lacie software cd which came with the cdrw just doesn't work on any machine, i now see. 
my only fire wire cable is 4 pin to 6 pin and this cdrw comes with a 6 pin socket, so i'd need 6 to 6 pin. 
i'll try to get a cable that'll fit (not that cheap over here in the uk) but as the cd appears to be useless i'm not sure if that's the solution. 
a new toast cd may solve the issue....? i'm beginning to think that this sohr 5238s model is better suited to pc's - i checked xlr8yourmac.com and it looks that way to me. 
patchburn doesn't resolve the issue either.
