has anyone with the emachines t6212 had any problems reading software dvds? 
my radeon x800 card came with a pc dvd version of the game thief: deadly shadows, but the drive won't read it. 
every other computer i've tried the disc on has booted up the game install screen from the disc with no problems. the same drive will recognize movie dvds with no problems though. 
is this my particular drive, or is it a driver problem with the t6212 in general? 
i called e-machines tech support and they were pretty much useless - they wanted me to reformat my hard drive, as if that was going to solve a hardware problem. 
i tried reinstalling the drivers for the dvd drive but it didn't make any difference. 
any feedback or suggestions would be much appreciated, thanks!
