that was one of the 1st things i did after putting xp on the other computer, but it just said &quot;you have to run network setup wizard on each computer you want to join the network. 
i ran it on both and its still saying i dont have permission, when im logged in as the admin on both computers. is there some kind of order i should do them in? 
thanks.
