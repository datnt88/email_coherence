trust me, i'm not stalking you or anything. 
hope my other comment was useful. 
as far as my knowledge goes, there is no difference between name brands and the generic stuff. 
i know that hdmi cables are all held to a certain standard and therefore they are all of technical equal quality. 
i think you pay more for the name brands simply because they are recognizable. 
they also look pretty nice. 
that being said, i never buy monster cables. 
they are so overpriced. 
i have to give a shout out to again. 
those guys treat me right. 
their cables look great, they have a lifetime warranty (just like monster), and they are cheap! 
what's better than that?
