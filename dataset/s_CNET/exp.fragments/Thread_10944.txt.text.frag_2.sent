does your windows 2000 cd fail to boot? 
if so that is the next issue to address. 
check your bios setting to be sure that the cdrom is set to boot first. 
then duplicate your windows 2000 cd and see if the copy boots. 
if that fails try an external usb cdrom drive or another internal cdrom (replace yours!!!) drive. 
as these cd/dvd drives age they can fail to be bootable but work in windows. 
your old tech person will know this but new to repair staffers will lose time as they wonder why.
