it sounds to me like they may have installed some software which runs in the background taking up cpu time. is it your parents' computer? 
you should sit down and have a discussion with them about the problem and let them know the shop really messed up the computer. 
it could be one of those eblaster programs which is very hard to disable which keeps taking records of what you do with your computer. 
in any event i'd get webroot spysweeper from for $30 and ad-aware se from the pay upgrade and run those and then all and get a good antivirus and firewall like mcafee at and install it. 
if it is your computer maybe a good reformat of the hard drive is in order as well, that might help to eliminate the problem. 
i wouldn't use that shop again.
