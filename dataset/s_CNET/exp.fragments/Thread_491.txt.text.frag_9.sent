sorry guys i am now for the first time with cnet at a total loss. 
i have explored every avenue that i have been advised to explore. 
i have a program that checks for driver updates etc. i did this however this program reported that all drivers were up to date. 
after 17 tries to update sp3 i give up. 
can cnet please tell me how to contact microsoft to ask their advice on how to download sp3. 
i feel i have worried you guys enough without success. 
thanks.
