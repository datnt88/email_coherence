i was trying a trial software for home networking and its a nice program, but it cannot settle for some reason me sharing files and folders. 
so i decided to remove it and go along with windows xp network wizard. 
btw, i have a wirless usb adapter on laptop, which oddly, i am able to go on the internet with it via my router. 
getting back to xp networking, i ran the wizard on both computers, and only one has an ip address, the host when i do ipconfig. 
the laptop comes back with: desination host unreachable ( 4 x ).packet 100% loss. 
i disabled firewall. 
just what else is there to do? the message says check connections. 
someone told me to check dchp i believe is the acronym..but the wizard does not give me that option...only my router does.
