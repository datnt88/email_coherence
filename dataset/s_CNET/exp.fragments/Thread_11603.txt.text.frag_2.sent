at the suggestion of a friend i also checked event viewer for errors. 
there are a number of errors from the time when the crsh occured, and nothing previous to that. it didnt tell me anything i didn't already know. 
i also swapped the it with the primary slave. 
same complications. 
i tried another chkdsk /f and /r: c:documents and settingswifileecher&gt;chkdsk /r g: the type of the file system is ntfs. 
unable to determine volume version and state. 
chkdsk aborted. 
c:documents and settingswifileecher&gt;chkdsk /f g: the type of the file system is ntfs. 
unable to determine volume version and state. 
chkdsk aborted.
