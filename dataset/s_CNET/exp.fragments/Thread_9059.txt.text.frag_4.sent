thanks for the advice. 
the sound is like the hd is revving. 
i'm using hd tune pro and i've been on the pc for about 30 minutes and the temp is 102 degrees fahrenheit. 
i'm not sure if that's good or bad. 
i'm using their acoustic management option and the pc is not making that revving noise. 
i guess that confirms that it is a spinning issue. 
at least i can would a cooling system help? 
it's a dell xps gen 5 which has 4 hd slots (only 1 is being used).
