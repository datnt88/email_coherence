yes, you are right. 
total recovery pro( ) has a function called offsite copy can help you avoid disasters of local site. 
the function uses ftp to upload your backup images to remote ftp site; so you can get back your data from that site. 
another way is using online backup. 
online backup will backup files/folders to internet, but it may take you some money by calculating the data size.
