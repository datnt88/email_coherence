i have setup my netgear wifi router and i can access it with my computer. 
but what do i need to do to get it working with my second computer. 
on my second computer i have already installed the wifi adapter and it is working as it sends packets but dosent recieve any. 
do i need to install any isp software. 
i checked my tcp/ip setings and are ok. i dont know if i have to do anything else..
