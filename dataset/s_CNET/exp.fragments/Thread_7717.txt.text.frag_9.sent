to help you we need to know the mfg name, series and model # of the pc you have (hp pavilion dv9700). 
if your pc is a generic clone, we need the mfg name, model # and revision of the motherboard (gigabyte ga-p55-ud3p rev 1.0). 
without knowing the exact info no one can give anything close to a 'right answer' to your questions.
