&quot;free music files&quot; seems like p2p (limewire and such). 
using programs like that is a well-known risk. 
it's likely that you should have said: &quot;my daughter stores free music files on the 100 gb disk and while doing so has allowed malware/viruses/trojans on the 40 gb disk.&quot; but, to be fair, that's not sure. 
there can be many other reasons for a pc to be slow, especially if it's an older one like this (slow cpu, not enough ram, too many programs active, installed and running a lot of junk); but malware is common reason also.
