i built a 3 ghz p4 system @ 800fsb, 400w power supply, with a gigabyte ga-8s648fx motherboard, 512mb pc3200 ram, and a radeon 9600 graphics card. 
it's been running fine, but now, without warning, it blacks out and shuts off in the middle of working. 
i try to click the power button to turn it back on.. and nothing! 
dead. 
if i remove the battery on the mboard, and reinstall it, the bios is reset and the system powers up again. 
until a few hours/days later, out of the blue.. it will do the same thing and i need to uninstall and reinstall the battery to reset the bios. 
threads there seems to be no performance issues before the comp shorts out, so i do not think it's my mb/ram/or cpu. 
power is still supplied to my optical mouse even when it blacks out, so i am skeptical if it's my power supply, but i have heard of crappy pss being shipped with custom cases. 
any one experienced this? 
any thoughts?
