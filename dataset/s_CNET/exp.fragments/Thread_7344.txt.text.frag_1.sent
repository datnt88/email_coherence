hi i would like to know if its safe to keep a usb flash key with my backup saved on it in my computor usb drive at all times or when i have finished a backup should i take the usb key out?. this is because i noticed it flashing red when i was not using it. 
and i was wondering why it was flashing and thought it was spyware or was it just windows xp os or firewall checking it. 
thanks
