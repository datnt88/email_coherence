what's your price range - if you do not have any problems to spend 400-500 bucks on a tablet computer then you should head straight to ipad, galaxy tab or even google nexus 7. as far as i can see, battery life and processor is one of the most important factors while choosing a tablet for your family member. 
you should definitely consider google nexus 10 as a forum member mentioned before. 
but if i were you - i'd buy either nexus 10 or ipad 4th (not mini ipad cause it's the same s.cnet.dev 
s.cnet.test 
s.cnet.train 
scripts except it's smaller)
