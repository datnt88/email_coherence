but what issue are you trying to solve? 
if you are seeking networking information, either google it or get a book. 
here i'm more than willing to tackle a problem. 
for tutorials, you can get that from google or books. 
again, love to chat about the stuff you won't find in books but for generic networking you have a web to read.
