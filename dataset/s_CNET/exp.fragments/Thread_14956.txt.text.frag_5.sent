thanks so much for this suggestion. 
i will take it into consideration. 
i've been reading reviews on a lot of d-link products, i.e. routers and it's a hit and miss type of situation with varying reviews. 
i just want my pci card and laptop adapter to be compatible with whatever d-link router i purchase. 
i don't have a lot of funds to purchase lots of unneccesary peripherals so i need to keep this very economical and basic. 
once again, thanks for your suggestion.
