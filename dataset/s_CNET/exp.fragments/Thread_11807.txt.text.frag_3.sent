i havent cleaned the case out - will do first thing. 
spyware - pc hasn't been hooked up to network yet, so no internet = no spyware - the hard drive i formatted as soon as i got it. 
btw the lights on the keyboard + mouse come on, then says error 301 keyboard not plaugged in or something like that before even hit's windows at boot - mouse stopped working altogether under windows, though laser is on and mouse works ith other machines. 
what should i clean it with?
