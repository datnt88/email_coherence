i want to buy a widescreen lcd display (native resolution 1920x1200). 
i want to know if i need a new video card. 
i am not into games or other stress graphics applications. 
my systems is sony vaio 2002 vintage. 
it uses a sis 650_740 chip set and has an agp card (from manual). the manual says the resolution available from the agp depends on the graphics monitor. 
i use a sony multi-scan crt which i drive at its max resolution of 1600x1200. 
i want to know if my existing video card can drive the lcd in its native resolution of 1920x1200. 
or whether i need something new. 
if so what?
