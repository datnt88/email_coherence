thanks for the info. 
i live in the usa. 
are you saying that any socket 939 will work on that motherboard? 
i did find one processor amd-athlon 64 single core 3500+ processor-2.2ghz-34p1044 
from a vendor. 
it is a step up but if i can get a faster one that is compatible i'm open to that too. 
this is a hand-me-down computer that i thought might make a good dvr but i do need at least 2.2 ghz to do the job from what hauppage says.
