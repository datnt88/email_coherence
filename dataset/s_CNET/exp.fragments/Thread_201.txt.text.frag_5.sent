first, i read somewhere that windows wizard for networking takes into account about firewalls...regardless, i had it disabled anyway on both computers. 
your right about magic network..it is fickled..so i removed it. 
now, my systems were working when i had a ethernet connection, and that was done with xp wizard. 
now that i got a usb adapter wi-fi for my laptop, i couldn't get to share files or folders although they were chosen in setup. 
i am able to get to the internet though.the 
adapter is not at fault, because me and a tech of theirs established that, plus the fact i am able to get on the internet. 
i was wondering if the software that came with the usb adapter may be at fault...if i remove it, then most likely i would not be able to get on the internet also. 
so i am at a loss.
