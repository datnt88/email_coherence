i too faced this issue and discovered that the seagate barracuda drives offer a 5 year warranty (parts/labor) whereas all others only offered 3 years max. 
this becomes a great indictor of dependability for the drives. 
at less than $100.00 for a 500gb drive, add another $30.00 for a usb external case and your problem is solved.
