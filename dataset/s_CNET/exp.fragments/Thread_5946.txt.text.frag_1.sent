hi, with the help of someone on this site as well as a few other people i have recently purchased a new desktop pc. i have not purchased a monitor yet and i don't really know much about them. 
i have narrowed down the monitors i want to 2 choices. 
this is the first monitor. 
this is the second monitor. 
they are nearly an identical price so i am not worried about that part. 
i just need to know which one is better. 
also if someone knows of a better monitor to get for around $200cad or less please let me know. 
(keep in mind i am from canada) if you are interested, here is the computer the monitor will be hooked up to. 
thank you in advance for anyone that can help me with this.
