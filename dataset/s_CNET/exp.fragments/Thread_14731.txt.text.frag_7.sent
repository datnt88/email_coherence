you should check the registry to see if the hard drive's id is still listed there. 
(follow this path: run/regedit/hkey_local-machine/hardware/devicemap).if the drive's id is not there, then it is possible that your registry was corrupted when the computer was improperly shut down. 
in this case, you have two choices of how to fix the problem. 
either you can use the recovery console from the windows 7 disc to repair the registry or simply uninstall the os and reinstall it again.
