i have just completed the setup of my new vista htcp. 
i am using the il-90mv. 
core 2 duo 2 ghz. 
nmedia 200a case. 
install went pretty well, i even got the viiv software installed and working correctly. 
my issue is the cpu temp. the nmedia case has two temperature sensors that display cpu and case temp on the vfd.the cpu temp starts around 75 f and within 30 minutes heads up to about 93f. it will then stay at 93 f for as long as i have it on.
