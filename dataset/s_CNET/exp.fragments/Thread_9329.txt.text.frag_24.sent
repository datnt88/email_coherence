amen! to kjt6660: you do realize, do you not, that moderators in general tend to know more than we mere &quot;mortal&quot; computer users do. 
it's one thing to try to answer someone's question to the best of our knowledge and within the limits of the question, but when we're asked to read the questioner's mind the whole process bogs down. 
at this point a &quot;computer coach&quot; sounds like an excellent idea.
