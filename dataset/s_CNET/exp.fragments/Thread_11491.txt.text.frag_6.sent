i have decided to go without the gpu and see how things work. 
actually, i won't be doing much if any video editing until sometime next year. 
in your previous post you mentioned the haswell and i have been giving that very serious thought along with an asus mobo (because it supports dual monitors) and now i am investigating a psu that will be compatible with the haswell which as i understand it needs a psu that can work with a very low voltage when the cpu is in &quot;sleep mode&quot;.
