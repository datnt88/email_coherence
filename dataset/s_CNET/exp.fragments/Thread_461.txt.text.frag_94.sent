the over night trick to clear the nozzle usually works for me. 
another trick is, if one nozzle in blocked, is to print a word document that has a lot of print on it, but change the colour of the print to the same as the blocked nozzle and print on the plain paper setting but change the type of paper to photo/best photo setting, doing this makes the printer deposit far more ink that in the text setting thus acting as a cleaning cycle. 
it also saves wasting ink form the other cartridges while doing a complete head clean.
