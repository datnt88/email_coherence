thanks for all the suggestions. 
i'd tried some and considered all. 
i learned that 15&quot; monitors have a native resolution of 1024 x 768. 
that horizontal viewing size is very close to my 19&quot; crt. 
does that mean that the height is the same as my crt which is 11&quot;? 
most importantly, am i correct in thinking that the 1024 x 768 resolution is the same actual icon and text size on both types? 
finally, i see that there are few 15&quot; anymore so i need some reccomendations. 
i have a tv tuner card in my computer and often watch tv both in a small box and full screen if this matters. 
i can check the manf. 
web sites to see if they will take one of those arm mounts on the back although i assume that they all can. 
thanks in advance for the info.
