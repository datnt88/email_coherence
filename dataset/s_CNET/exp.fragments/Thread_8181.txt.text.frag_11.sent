i am able to shed some new liht on this which may or may not be able to fix it heres the thing i found... my problem started when i switched from an actiontec 9100em what happens is basically i can not stream anything from wireless to wired connections or vice versa. 
i am able to temporarily fix this by going into setup-advanced-yes-ip address distribution and change it from dhcp server to one of the other options and then change it back and all works, until the connection resets i have tried every setting i can think of, and was thinking maybe i need to reflash the firmware to fix it? 
any help would be appreciated .... report inappropriate content message 1 of 12 (359 views) ....reply ... ....... ... i can duplicate this fix and get all the access too all the media servers and all my libararies too stream on my ps3 or my tv. but when i do it disconnects me from the internet on my tv and on my ps3 so obviou8sly this is progress, but its not the solution i need. 
in order to regain internet on my tv, and my ps3 i have to reset my router to factory settings. 
obviously i need to be able to keep my internet on my tv, ps3, and have access too all my media servers. 
maybe this clue will help u be able to solve this? 
i dunno what to do next. 
they came and replaced the motehrboard of the tv so its obviously somethoing to do with the routers&gt; advanced setting&gt; ip address distribution... because if i change it from dhcp server to dhcp relay or disabled all media servers then show up but i cant use the internet on the tv or ps3. 
any ideas please?
