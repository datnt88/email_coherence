unless the bios is hardwired(bios set) not to allow such a larger hd, you can install a big hd. what may happen, is you may need to partition the new hd for the bios to see 80gb or 120gb as 1st partition. 
then the bios is happy and the remaining hd is used a 2nd partition and not wasted. the supplied recovery/restore os disks should offer not only the original install process(8gb is reserved for os recovery) but also partitioning as well as an option. 
in many cases, new hds supply their own install setup, you can then use the &quot;copy/image portion&quot; to fill the 1st partition, etc.. offhand, i don't think it will be a problem, but i found laptops unique all to often, so i can't give a clear answer, sorry. 
i have found newer laptops are simpler to deal with.
