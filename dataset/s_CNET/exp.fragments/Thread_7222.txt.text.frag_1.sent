for some reason my screen size always resets to 640x480 when i startup my machine. 
then when i go to control panel and resize it, i am told i must restart my computer. 
so i have done that, but the setting never adjusts back to where i need it. 
therefore, everything on the screen is blurry all the time. 
can anyone please help???? i am completely at a loss for what to do. 
thanks...
