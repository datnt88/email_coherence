hi, 2 days ago i was using my computer as normal when all of a sudden it turned off and won't turn on any more. 
pressing the power button does absolutley nothing. 
no fans, no hdd, no nothing. 
i thought it's most likley the psu or motherboard but im not sure which. 
through further investigation i have discovered that: 1. the lan lights are allways on at the back of the computer, but its no longer detected by my router (it usually is, even when off) 2. upon unplugging the pc from the mains and plugging it back in again, my webcam (which is usb powered) makes it's 'i have power' noise. 
3. upon unplugging the pc from the mains and pluggin it back in again, my memory (which has led lights to show the load) light up for a few seconds). 
these 3 facts make me lean towards a mobo issue. 
i've tried removing everything non essential from the pc and botting up again but still nothing at all. 
i've also reset the cmos but no joy there either. 
can you help with the problem?
