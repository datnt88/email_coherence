ummmm... something's gone wrong. 
not sure what it is yet. 
i started transfering movies to the new drive, while simultaneously browsing on chrome, and chatting on msn. 
since i've upgraded the ram to 7 gb this kind of simple multitasking has never been a problem. 
but... while i was transfering it started these huge bouts of lag, each one lasting over 5 seconds, spaced about a minute apart. 
i tried to shut off msn and chrome, but my entire computer locked up, i had to force shut down using the power button and unplugged the new drive. 
now i'm scared to plug it back in again. 
any idea what the hell just happened?
