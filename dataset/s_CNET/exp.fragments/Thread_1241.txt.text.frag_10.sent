sorry to confuse the issue. the software you suggested is the virtual router i couldn't get to start. 
bufferzone free is sandbox virtualization software reviewed elsewhere in cnet. 
i found bufferzone held ports open - 135, 139, 445 - in addition to really slowing down browser speed. 
maybe a netbook with only 2gb of ram, an atom processor, and windows 7 starter edition just isn't a good candidate for these types of programs.&lt;div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
