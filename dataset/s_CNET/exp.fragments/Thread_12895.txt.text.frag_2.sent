the problem could just be that the enclosure isn't compatible with the drive. 
another thing, that i noticed you didn't put down, was that you used the driver cd that came with the drive on your laptop. 
that might be your problem. 
windows xp might not have the driver in it's driver library, so you will have to use the installation cd that came with the drive to install the correct driver, then plug in the enclosure. 
that's why my best bet would be, it is not recognizing that the drive is there, because it doesn't even recognize the dvd-rw drive as being a drive, since it is so new.
