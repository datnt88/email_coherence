i've got 2 questions: 1. what's better for making the pc softwares (not games) run faster and making the pc stuck less? 
increasing the ram from 256 to 512 or upgrading the processor [details in here - ] to a new one? 
(let's say- p3 933mhz?) 2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop. 
what can be the problem?
