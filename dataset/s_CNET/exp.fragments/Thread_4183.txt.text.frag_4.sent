providing if all specs remain the same, the sum total of price will be based on the degree of &quot;gee whiz&quot; factor. 
that would include the testing, heat dissipation(alloys), and then the color and/or looks. 
it's not what you all see that's apparent, because testing for &quot;every module&quot; you pay for rather than a sampling test. the best attached cooling fins, is yet another step and/or whatever is provided. 
next, while color isn't always helpful, it maybe more a selling point to include any led lightings. 
last, if ever needed, the warranty while present maybe more forgiving in order to appease those that make wrong choices or along those lines.
