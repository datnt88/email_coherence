okay, so i'm a fairly active gamer and an avid computer user, and i'm very excited about building a new pc. the issue is that while i know what all the hardware does and how to install all of it, i'm a little out of date on the current generation of computer hardware. 
i want to keep my comp at or around $1,000. 
i think that seems pretty reasonable. 
i would like to try some of the more cpu intensive games, but if i can't run say... stalker or supreme comander, i think i'll live. 
so here are my questions: as far as processors go, i'm not sure what all the new generation stuff is about (like the dual core compared to quad core, compared to a p4 or amd equivalent). 
i'm also a bit unsure what i have to look out for when getting a mobo. 
i think i recollect some issues about compatibility between motherboards and processors (and maybe other hardware too) but once again, i'm not really sure. 
with the power supply, do sites like newegg have listed the power drain that each part pulls, or is it kind of an estimation thing? 
i want to make sure i get the right stuff. 
finally, i'm sure i'm being a little optimistic when asking this, but would anyone be able to post a rough breakdown of the best way to put 1k into a computer. 
just specs are fine, no need to link parts or anything. 
if anyone could shed light on any or all of these, i would really appreciate it. 
cheers -ry
