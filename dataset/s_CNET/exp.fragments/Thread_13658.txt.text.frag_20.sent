i have had the misfortunate that my inspiron 600 m mother board died. 
as usual dell ordered the part and whhen they did get to service provider &quot; nantech&quot;, we had to beg for next day service. the tech said he had no time till the week after&quot; sevice contacts stipultes next day service&quot; needless to say, we manged to get the tech to our facility to replace the mother board, which turned out to be defective. 
we had to start from the beggining and that were hell broken down. 
calls to tech support often routed over seas to india, the phillipines and panama, before one could get an answer from the usa. 
although dell shipped the parts, it took 3 days to get the service. 
we have relied on dell for 15 years as a soul pc supplier but no more. 
this is because: 1.tech staff at dell do not have much to say to service providers 2. service providers &quot;outsourced&quot; extremely un-professional and lack ethics. 
3. next day service coudl extends to 3- 5 days service and one has no power to affect that. 
dell has been least repsonsive. 
4. dell quality and workmanship is not what it used to be. 
do not listen to the reviewers 5. last, i do not want to call a company where who ever handles calls reads from a page before you could even talk to them. 
dell sucks big time!
