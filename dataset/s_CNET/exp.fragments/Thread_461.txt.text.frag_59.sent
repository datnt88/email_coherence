i've had good and bad experience with refill ink. 
good ink i have used is from 123refills.com and also from sameink.com - good comprehensive refill instructions and also they have tech support by email if you need it. 
i have not used it on an epson printer as i don't own one! 
but i have used it on my cannon pixma 3000 and also on my hp all in one unit. 
they both worked great for regular printing. 
sameink inks worked best on my cannon for picture printing. 
the bad ink i purchased was from filljet.com - not that it did not work, but the colors were not as bright. the black was almost gray!
