i'll ask how old the battery is. 
if it's relatively new, i'd remove it from the device and store it in a cool and dry environment. 
if it's and oldie (3 or more years), i'd do the same but consider having a replacement handy. 
lead acid batteries tend to develop a metallic sulfate coating over time and especially when allowed to discharge. 
these sealed types will also develop bulges. 
if you notice such happening, it's time to replace it anyway.
