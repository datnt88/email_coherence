i recently got a nvidia geforce 8400gs pci card and had it installed and working fine in a 4-year old emachines. 
but i removed the card before swapping it for a nearly new emachines w3650. 
for some reason, the card doesn't work in the new computer. 
it's physically installed ok, it's got power; the cooling fins get very warm, the drivers loaded ok, and i disabled the onboard graphics. 
device manager says it's &quot;working properly&quot;, for what that's worth. 
when i plug the monitor cable into the card, there's nothing. 
black screen. 
am i missing something, or could the card have died somehow?
