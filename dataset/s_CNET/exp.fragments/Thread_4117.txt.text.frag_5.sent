thanks for your suggestions i had tried the unit as a bare bones unit (mother board and crt) this proprietary board has the sound and video built in but i removed all peripheral cards. 
the mobo fails to issue the power on signal to power up the ps regardless of the configuration of the system. 
there is never any sign of an attempt to run the post or any sign that the processor ever started to run or boot up. 
unfortunately the test results are pointing toward the motherboard. 
thanks tom r
