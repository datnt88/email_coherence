but you may have to create and build the last interface with some boards and software. 
unlike the ir controls which is a pure bit on software kit, this requires much more work. 
i find many are not ready for this work but as i have done this in the past i do have solid ideas on how to create it. 
however there appears to be no off the shelf system to note yet. 
if there is something made it would be specific to what you would control.
