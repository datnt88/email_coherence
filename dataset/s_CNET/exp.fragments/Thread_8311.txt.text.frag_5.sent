hi pudgyone, have had my dell 964 for a while but recently changed routers and since then cannot get any of my computers to recognize the printer driver during installation. 
have gone through the whole step wise proces with no luck. 
any other advice. 
i have a mad with parallels with winxows xp and a pc with windows xp. i seem to always get stuck at the point where it just does not recognize the mac address or the ip address.
