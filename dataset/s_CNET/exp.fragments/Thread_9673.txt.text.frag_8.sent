my last hp (literally!) would not boot to windows when many things were in the usb port. 
a bit of research tracked it down to a flaw in the bios hp sourced for this model. 
the name was &quot;insyde&quot; and hp made it clear they had no means to correct the flaw. 
keep in mind that it was not a flaw in the handful of smart phones, usb drives and hubs in this case.
