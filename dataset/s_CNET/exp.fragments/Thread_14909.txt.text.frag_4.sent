i have made a stupid mistake: instead of opening the file from c:..., i saw the link and didn't even read it, but opened it in the browser. 
thought it was a page used when updating driver. 
but when i read your articol with more attention, i found the bug. 
now, everything is working just fine. 
thank you so much for your help.
