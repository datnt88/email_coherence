after formatting, your 500gb hdds it turns into about 465gbs of usable disk space. 
you might want to check disk management to see how the total space is allocated. 
you've already accounted for 258gbs and 186gbs...that's 444gbs....is there more free space or perhaps a hidden recovery partition somewhere? 
if yes....then you got what was advertised and maybe then some. 
recommend you verify the facts before losing more sleep or wasting more time.
