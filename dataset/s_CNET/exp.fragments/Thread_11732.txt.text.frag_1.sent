i have an internal dsl modem that has internet connection sharing enabled and a network switch connecting it to the other computers in the house, and my xbox. 
however, i can't get my xbox live to work. 
i input the dns server values that my isp gave me. 
every time i try to connect it comes up with an error that says &quot;network services (dhcp or ppoe) were not found&quot; i know that i do not have a ppoe dsl connection. 
help me please.
