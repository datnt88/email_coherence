i wouldn't hestitate to offer that you replace the power supply(psu). 
it will cause flaky operation and effect everything and appears its this or that. 
replacement is just good insurance even if not the problem and make it a good namebrand and higher wattage psu. 
if it was the psu and been acting up for awhile, other componets can take a nose dive or start to fail. 
thus, secondary problems occur and that can be any device/componet. 
remove the cd drives power connections and note that on the bios(not present). 
does it seem the system starts to settle down? 
if yes, replace psu. 
you can further check the ram as they can also mimick similar problems, but usually you can't fix them, replace only. 
they are very, very, very dependant on good stable power.
