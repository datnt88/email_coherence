your 250w psu is getting a little light. 
i can't think of a good reason why 2 sticks of 1gb would consume more power than 2 sticks of 256mb but keep the psu in mind. 
memtest for 2 hrs on 2gb of memory might not tell you much....let it run for 24hrs+. 
since your working with an old clunker check the maker for any bios/mobo updates that might address this issue. 
consider the possibility that 3/4 yrs ago no normal person put 2gb into a machine, so the maker didn't spend a lot of time making that work. 
crucial is talking about installing in pairs so i'll assume dual channel. 
what happens if you install in single channel mode?
