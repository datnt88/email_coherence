the lacie d2 has now worked, erased cd disks, burned data, etc via the toast 6 lite disk which has also done what it's supposed to.... i decided to try the lacie with the usb again, not the firewire cable and suddenly everything began to show up. 
couldn't believe it. is it possible that there was a conflict with classic (not now installed) or was firewire 'too fast' for it all ? 
even the lacie cd which came with the cdrw has opened toast on my mac but it wouldn't do anything before i zeroed hd/reinstalled 10.3 and updated to 10.3.9. apart from the odd freeze where toast only launched after a restart, it's perfect. 
thanks for the advice given.
