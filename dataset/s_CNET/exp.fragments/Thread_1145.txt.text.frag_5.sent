...and i have been going around and around and around with this problem for about 2 weeks now, and i am still beating my head against the same (fire)wall... the same user account exists on both computers, both with admin priviledges. the drives i want to map to have been fully shared. 
both ethernet cards are configured with static ips on the same subnet. 
i can ping each machine from the other. the windows firewall has been turned off on both machines, but i still can't map a freakin' drive!!! &quot;the network resource cannot be found.&quot; 
can anyone provied a clue as to what might be going on before i take a hammer to both machines? 
i have been networking various home computers for years and i have never had this problem before, so i am really frustrated and at a loss as to what is going on. 
could it be a hardware problem of some sort? 
or some mysterious windoze tweak? 
help!!!!
