of the ps by itself to see if it turns on??? jumper between green wire and any of the black wires on the 20/24 pin connector??? also the mobo with no cpu, no memory, nada, only the power supply plugged in to the 20/24 pin, and then momentary contact short between the two power pins on the mobo?? obviously the power supply is providing the 5 volt standby power to the mobo. the next question is does the mobo logic circuit turn the other power supply rails on when the mobo puts a logic low on the pin with the green wire. 
again, if the power supply by itself, sitting on the table is plugged in to the ac power and you jumper the green wire to any one of the black wirees and maintain the two connected, the power supply should turn all the rails on as noted by its fan rotating. 
can't be simpler than this to see if the poweer supply can turn on.
