hello, i bought a dell inspiron 546 that comes with a intigrated ati radeon hd3200 graphics card recently. 
i also purchased an 23&quot; asus vh-232h monitor. 
for some reason the desktop screen won't fill the entire 23 inch screen. 
i'm getting black bars around the edges of the monitor. 
is this a limitation of the video card or something i'm missing with the settings? 
thanks in advance for your help.
