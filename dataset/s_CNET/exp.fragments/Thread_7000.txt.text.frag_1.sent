hi, i have an all-in-one desktop pc and it has two hdmi ports but i called the manufacture and they said its an input (for gaming devices etc) i am just wondering if its possible to change and hdmi input to an output? 
maybe some sort of device or extension thingie? 
thank you for taking the time to read and/or respond to this. 
guesswho
