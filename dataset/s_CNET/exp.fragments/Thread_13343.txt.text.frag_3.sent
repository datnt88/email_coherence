honestly, i don't see a difference between the two. the specs are exactly the same for both. 
if you're concerned about ghosting, look at the response time, the lower, the better. the only way to tell is to go into the store and look at it yourself. 
otherwise you can only rely on specifications alone. 
i'd say get whatever one is cheaper.
