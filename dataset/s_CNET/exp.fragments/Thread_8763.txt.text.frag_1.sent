i recently bought a hauppauge 1178 wintv-hvr-1600 ( [l= [/l] ) and opened it to then find out it only supports hd from over the air broadcasts (atsc.) i'm looking for a tv tuner that can watch and record in hd from my comcast cable box. 
i have hd comcast cable box, and i want to be able to watch and record from that source on my computer, as i do not have a hd tv, and my computer is all i have that is capable of playing hd. (1900*1200 res) are there any tv tuner cards that i can put in my pc that will let me do this?
