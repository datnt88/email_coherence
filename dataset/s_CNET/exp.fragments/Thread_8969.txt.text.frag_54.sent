i've owned three &quot;modern&quot; conmputers in the past7 years, and have totally crashed every one of them several times. 
when i get a new one, i put it through its paces (and then some). 
so, first thing i do is create a full image. 
then as i go along, i create subsequent images. 
that way, no matter how hard i may be on these things, i can always restore the entire hard drive to what it was at the last image point.
