the usb connection required that the owner's pc usb support be &quot;there&quot;. 
you can't imagine the number of posts about usb problems. 
as such, i toss about 1/2 the bad reviews out just because many can't resolve usb issues. 
on top of that there is no support from dazzle to help you fix your pc's usb issue. 
i've used the dazzle products and like them. 
but then i never have an usb issue. the software is, of course dated now. 
plus those on dos based oses will scream about 4 gb file limits and what else will occur on the dos based oses. 
i know this is not a full answer, but do consider that the user reviews do have issues. 
if you want a little better solution, try some pci tv capture card.
