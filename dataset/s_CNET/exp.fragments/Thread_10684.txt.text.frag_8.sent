what they are to work on. 
if you blindfold me, i can't see what i'm working on. 
hey, that's your choice but be prepared to get flames on some boards if you try that. 
&quot;why do you need to know my system info. the computer plays the games fine but it is the screen which has the problem with any type of game.&quot; for example some video cards have tools to limit video modes, some games have settings you need to tinker with. 
-&gt; your discussion has many replies now but you didn't reveal the details and the discussion is now about why the details are needed. 
best of luck, bob
