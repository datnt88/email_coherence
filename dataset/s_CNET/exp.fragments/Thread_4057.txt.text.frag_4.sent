&quot;domain&quot; should never be seen or written about here. 
if you see &quot;domain&quot; then your install is improper. 
since you have no dhcp server you'll have to assign ip addresses manually. 
tell me what you used so the picture of the setup is complete. 
also you need to have accounts on both machines and directories shared. 
example. 
your account is called 'sam'. 
'sam' must have an account on both machines with same password please.
