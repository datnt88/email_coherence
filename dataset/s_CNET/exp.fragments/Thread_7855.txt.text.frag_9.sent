aside from the wonderful hints above, (as overheating would cause the laptop to do this) i would try to verify that the laptops are good and clean with anti-virus and anti-rootkit software. 
if it was just one laptop, sure i could see the above being true more so, but for both laptops (not out of the question) shutting down? 
i am sure you must share files? 
music perhaps? 
i just start with easy then dig inside. the difference in hardware also supports my decision.
