you can use office to do what you are describing. 
you both can have access to the files and both can modify them. 
i don't have need for this feature so i cannot give you details of how it works, but it saves the file online and you have access to it from anywhere as long as you have the password. 
as someone has pointed out, this function is also available in windows 7 without the need for office if you don't need the other features of office.
