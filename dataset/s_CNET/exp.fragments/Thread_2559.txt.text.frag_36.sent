although the vista os is not yet being offered on new computers, and will not until early to mid 2007, a lot of mfgs. 
are offering vista ready pc's. 
by this it means that they are ready to run the core components of the vista operating system. 
i have been test driving it for about a month now and i am getting to like it. 
my system has onboard graphics and as i am not a gamer, it runs just fine. 
i have a 3.2ghz processor, 2 80g hard drives and 2 gb of ram. 
i will be adding a graphics card with at least 256mb memory (vista minimum is 128mb) in order to experience the aero glass features. 
you can check out the microsoft website to get a handle on the minimum requirements for hardware to run vista if you choose to in the future. 
as you already have a monitor, you can easily find a system for well under $1,000. 
a lot, if not most of the time, with the big names, the monitor is included in the price. 
if the big name is not that important to you then you can really save money and still have a fully functional machine without all of the proprietory pests that come with the big names. 
take an evening and visit some of the online stores to see what they offer. 
it could be well worth the wait. 
good luck.
