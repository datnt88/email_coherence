that's the first accessory we bought and i'm glad we did. 
have no doubt that, when talking about hardware/software failure, it's not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;. 
even the usb drive is going to fail at some point. 
you can get external cd/dvd drives (almost all are burners too) for 50 bucks or under. the difference in cost to you will the drive minus the price of the flash drive. 
many...if not most...netbooks come with a backup utility that can burn rescue media to such drives. 
reconsider, if you can.
