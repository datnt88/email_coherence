if available, you can reset the nod32 config, to &quot;not&quot; scan during boot-up. 
you will need to scan manually or at some set time frame. 
also, if not restable, then delete the whole nod32 setup, once done, reboot. 
then re-install it and pay attention to the scan options, then and make non-scan during boot. 
at least most av scanner provide this option.
