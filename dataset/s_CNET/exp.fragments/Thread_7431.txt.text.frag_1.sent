which is better value for money? 
? 
i need the scanner to scan childhood photo's in. 
but if i'm buying a scanner, might as well get a 3 in 1? but i want my scans to be good quality. 
for enlargemnts. 
(not huge, but book size- i don't want to lose quality) what would you recommend? 
i don't want to spend much more than 60. i know - the dpi is better on the stand alone scanner - but how much is visible to the eye?
