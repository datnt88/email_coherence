my own experience has been that pci is better. 
possibly the card can use more power because it's installed straight into the motherboard -- and cooling issues don't usually arise. 
can have traditional pci installation annoyances. 
many instances of usb wireless adapters overheating -- and the wireless seems less effective. 
usually foolproof to install.
