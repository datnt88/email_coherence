i assume that you mean the amd athlon 64 x2, right? 
i built my system on this and love it. 
i think the performance is so much better than the pentium d's. 
and it seems i am not alone in this opinion, virtually every opinion, review, or site says the same thing. 
even if you aren't a gamer, fast is good, right? 
and dual is the way to go nowadays, especially with vista coming. 
you will benefit from dual core no matter what. the x2 3800+ is a great value-to-performance ratio at $300 from monarch. 
don't worry about comparing clock speeds, intel and amd rate them differently (as you prolly know). 
if you want more opinions, you can search my profile/posts for more info. 
good luck, cheers.
