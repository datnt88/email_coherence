hello everybody, i now have two hard drives, both with windows xp sp2 on them. 
currently the original hdd is now connected. 
i installed a new 320 gb wd caviar hard drive in our desktop computer where the original 120 gb seagate barracuda hdd was located. 
i successfully installed windows xp sp2 on the new hdd. 
i reinstalled the original hdd beneath the new one. 
i disconnected the new hdd. 
i then reconnected the original hdd until we have time to install all the updates, drivers, etc, as we ran out of time and needed the computer. 
we wish to keep the old hard drive as it is for now, until we can transfer just the files we need to the new hdd. 
we would then format the old hdd and use it without windows xp. the jumpers on both hdds are at factory settings. 
the data cable (which is round) is labeled: &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot;. 
our computer is about 3 years old, purchased from a local shop: amd athlon xp 3000 2.16 ghz, 2 gb ram, ati all-in-wonder w/128mb ram, 120 bg seagate barracuda hdd. 
i need to know what my options are. 
questions: 1. is our cable possibly a &quot;cable select&quot; type & how can i check? 
2. do i need to do anything with the jumpers? 
3. can i now connect both hdds? 
4. if yes, what will happen when i start the computer? 
5. how might we transfer files from on hdd to another? 
6. can we access both hdds without rebooting, how does this work? 
to all: tia fro your help.
