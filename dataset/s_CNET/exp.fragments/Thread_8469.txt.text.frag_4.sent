&quot;he part where the ide is being detected. 
i mean the part wherein when you press del you can access bios configuration. 
but if i disconnect the maxtor hard disk again, everything comes to normal.&quot;... all that means is that something is wrong with the drive. 
if it's worth saving, get a quote from drivesavers.com or ontrack.com 
not to bother you but why is what you can't lose only on hard disks?
