very simple, i cannot get out from sleep or hibernate mode without a hard shut down ( only remedy would be possibly re installing the os which i do not feel like doing) so those options are not available for me anyway. 
if i expect to use the machine within 2 hours, i leave it idle, otherwise it is shut down in order to save energy and other reasons.
