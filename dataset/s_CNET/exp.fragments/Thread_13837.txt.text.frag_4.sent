i think you mean that the new computer has a 250gb serial ata (sata) drive, and your old 160gb drive is parallel ata (pata). 
keep the 160gb drive jumpered as a slave. 
find the cable that the cd/dvd drive is on. 
insert the middle connector of that cable into the back of the 160gb drive. 
insert a power connector into the back of the 160gb drive. 
power on and test....
