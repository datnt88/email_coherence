...as yet. 
however, if it can live long enough to actually offer something new (sata 2/pci-express 2/co-processor) and show a performance increase over older (and cheaper) socket 939 systems with all it's cpu's (only the top teirs benefit from using am2's ddr2 at the moment)....who knows. 
early adopters, enthusiasts, and fans may adopt it, but personally i'll wait until something useful arrives. 
ultimately it's your own choice. 
good luck, geebee.
