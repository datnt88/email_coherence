i am wanting to get three of the devices, one of backing up to, another for mirroring that back up across town and the last one to keep junk on that i need on both my notebook and networks. 
usb 2 means that a computer needs to be switched on to access it and while most of the time the computer is on, sometimes people like to save the environment.
