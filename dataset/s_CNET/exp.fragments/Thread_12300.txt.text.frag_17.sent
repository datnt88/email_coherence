one: simply look at the subject line of the first reply to your original post. 
had you asked what spread spectrum was, how to mount the hard drive and the temp question all in one post, imho that would have been counterproductive. 
second: with the case that you have, and with use of sufficient number of fans, location, and direction of airflow for each, i would think that you can get the cpu temp into the low to mid 40 c's. 
[i have a 2.6 running at that at work with the top exhaust fan and 3 others plus the two in the power supply]. 
the heatsink fan and one of the power supply fans are temperature contolled for speed. 
remember that your room ambient temp affects the interior temp. 
if you run the room at 68 f vs 75f that is a delta t of 7 f degrees. 
[about 4 c degrees]. 
this difference will be reflected in the ambient air temp inside the case.
