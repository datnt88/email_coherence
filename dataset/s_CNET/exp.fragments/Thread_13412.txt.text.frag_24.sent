none of these are free to your customers and/or you! 
.....if they are doing it out of the kindness of their cold hearts, they must be getting profits or benefits somewhere. 
others here have mentioned better options for small business, that for the most part are using wifi access as a come on freebie in the first place. 
go to a revenue model where.... let's say they offer a percentage in return, your loyal locals will scatter and find a place they can drink a beer and check email, etc without having to pull out a credit cart or being a member of some wifi access global conglomerate! 
if we knew what router the owner was using that would help immensely. 
many routers have features for timed access, with a password that can also be programmed with a bandwidth limit. 
you can also restrict access sites or domains, if not a full blown block of sites with porn, etc. boingo is quite frankly a real turnoff for small businesses that are more interested in attracting customers than making their profits from wifi access. 
most regulars would quickly find another spot in this case to have some drinks and do normal things you do in a bar. 
for airports where you have non paying public that also have access. 
boingo is perfect........ but not a local bar or pub where the wifi access is just a fringe benefit, where the owner makes his money off his main business like serving drinks!
