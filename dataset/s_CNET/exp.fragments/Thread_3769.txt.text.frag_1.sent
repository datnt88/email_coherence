hello i installed a slave drive for backup,but when i restart my computer it does not show up in my computer every time. 
sometimes it shows up but not always. 
i'm afraid to put anything important on here in case i can't access it when i need it. the bios has it listed there as a slave drive. 
i went into disk management and formatted it and assigned it a drive letter,but the next time i turned on my computer it was gone. 
i am running xp home on a desktop emachines t6216, which is 1 year old. 
thanks in advance of any help you can give me. 
wendy
