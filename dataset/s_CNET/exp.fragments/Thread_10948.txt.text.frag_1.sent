i have the following configuartion: intel pentium iv 2.4 ghz (non-ht) intel d845gebv2 board 512 mb ddr inno3d geforce fx 5500 256 mb, vivo, agp 8x (supporting 4x) yesterday i moved my system upstairs and tried to connect it to the tv and it worked. 
after about 3-4 hours i experienced some strange hangups (but the card - graphics card) was still working. 
i removed the card and the hangups discontinued. the graphics card to me was okay. 
today, when i tried to install the card again in the agp slot. 
it simply refused to boot up the system. 
as soon as i start it, it hangs up, no display, no moving forward. 
no respone whatsoever. 
then, when i removed the card from the slot, the system works fine (&lt;-- i am on the same system atm). 
i also noticed one of my ddr was not tight. 
but i tightened it, and tried to repeat the process. 
no luck! 
i also tried to clear cmos by removing the battery/cell. 
and then still no luck! the card doesnt give any smell. 
it is still in good condition. 
no burning sings on it. 
except that i can't see whats beneath the heat sink. 
it's the 2nd week since i bought this card. 
i believe my graphics card is blown? 
anything to check out?
