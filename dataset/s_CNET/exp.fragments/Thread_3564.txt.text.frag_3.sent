i have a sony viao that is my main computer an had a net book. 
well the net book was good for a time but slow. 
replaced it with an ipad. 
my dad has dell laptop and netbook. 
same problem. 
laptop too big to travel with netbook to slow. 
we looked at transformer for him but he chose a hp 11 inch full laptop. 
has 6 gig ram and a decent hard drive. 
he loves it. 
portable but able to do every thing he wants.
