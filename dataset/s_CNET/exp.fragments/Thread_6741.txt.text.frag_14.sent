sorry, for a few days life went from being hetic to staying up until 3:00 am to get my work done. 
i did find the time to download network magic, and it looks promising, but one of the computers have now started acting up on me and i must reformate it. 
so, i will try it later. 
thanks for all your help. 
i am going to look over what you sent me and see what else i can do. 
raymon
