computer specification: 40gigs, pentuim 4, 2.8gh, windows xp pro. 
when i turn on computer the message &quot;check signal cable' appears than computer operates normally. 
i upgraded from win 2000 to xp pro and it took almost 12 hours to complete upgrading. 
now the start up of the computer takes about 5 minutes (very slow unlike before)to star up. 
can any body explain what could have caused this to happen. 
ta.
