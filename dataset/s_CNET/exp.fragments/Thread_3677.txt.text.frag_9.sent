yes i have the three black panther disks, it will not boot from these, nor will it boot from any other cd that i've tried so far. 
could it be that i'd upgraded to os x 3.5 before i lost my root password and the machine will not boot from these disk as they are only 3.3? 
should i try getting a later version of os panther to see if that works? the thing i can't understand is that my home desktop g4 runs on os x 3.3 and i can boot from any disk on that machine. 
could i have turned my powerbook's &quot;option to boot from a cd&quot; off in anyway? 
or perrhaps the powerbook needs to be running in single user (root) mode to be able to boot from a disk?
