i bought an internal card reader- got no drivers with it. 
when i first plugged it into my motherboard, windows xp popped up a message saying that the device was overdrawing power through the usb hookup and would not allow that port to send/ recieve info. 
i had used that port before with a usb port on my case and it worked fine. 
when i plugged it into another port on the motherboard it did the same thing. 
no drivers on xp would allow an install, and i could find nothing to help me anywhere! 
can anyone help me????
