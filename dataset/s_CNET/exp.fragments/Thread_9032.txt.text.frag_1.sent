i have 1 tb seagate hard disk which was working fine but now when i connect it to my laptop running with windows7, windows detects the hard disk and icon of the disk displays at my computer. 
but when i double click it to open it shows an error message box &quot; location is not available f:/ is not accessible access denied&quot;. 
and when i see properties by right clicking it is shows used space 0 bytes free space 0 bytes capacity 0 bytes also tried to check it for errors from tools it shows error message &quot;the disk check could not be performed because windows can not access the disk&quot; and also i have to tried to access it from command prompt (run as administrator) using command f: it shows &quot;access denied&quot; when i try to change access permission from properties/security by providing full control or changing the owner it shows &quot;unable to save the changes in permission information&quot;. 
and finally when i try to format the disk it shows &quot;you do not have sufficient rights to perform this operation&quot;. 
&lt;div&gt;and i have also tested two other external drives(wd &amp; seagate)but faced the same issue.&lt;/div&gt;how 
could this is possible that one day disk is working fine and next day it has this issue. 
please provide some solution to fix this.
