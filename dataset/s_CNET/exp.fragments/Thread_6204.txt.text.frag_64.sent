lots of good suggestions; i might switch to one of them. 
currently my wife and i have 2 computers (vista & windows7) and a seagate goflex external drive attached to our router. 
we have the same basic file system on all 3 hard drives, omitting some of the large old un-needed files from one or the other or both of our computers. 
when we change or create a file on one computer, we also update the external drive and also drop the new file into a special drop box on the external drive. the partner can periodically check the &quot;drop box&quot; and copy the new or revised file on his/her computer hard disk. 
then the file in the drop box is deleted. the difficult part is keeping the filing systems in sync, especially since we both keep finding ways to improve/streamline the file systems. 
that problem, synchronizing filing systems, would seem to be with us no matter which of the suggested file sharing systems we used.
