the primary question was general in nature: a customer had given me a few choice sticks of ram instead of cach (cache? 
bad pun?)so, when i went to cheque (check) the ram, found it had that u (pc3200u) whereas other sticks were w/o the u (pc3200). 
as for the more specific nature of propriatary ram - check out a dell motherboard: the notches on most(?) sticks of ram are off by a fraction - thus forcing you to buy ram directly from dell instead of your friendly neighbourhood computer warehouse.
