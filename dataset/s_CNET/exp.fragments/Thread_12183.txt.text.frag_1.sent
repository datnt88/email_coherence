hi, i was about to purchase 2 seagate 300gb hard drives (seagate as they have 5 yr warranty) with the intention of setting up a simple raid so that my data is mirrored across both drives, hence 2 copies of the same data, i believe its called raid 1, ofcourse i want the raid purely for backup reasons. 
i was all ready to go however a friend of mine told me that if my motherboard was to give up the ghost i would lose all my data unless i find the exact same motherboard and plug the hard drives in, this worried me as the whole point of setting up a raid is to have data protection, my thought was there is nothing fancy going on, just a simple copy of data will exist on both hard drives, i mean i thought even if i take both hard drives and put it in a totally different machine i can setup raid 1 mirroring again if needs be and it wouldnt be a problem. 
my motherboard is the abit kn8 series with the nforce4 chipset, i think the raid utility built into the motherboard is by nvidia but not 100% sure on that. 
any help or answers will be very much appreciated as i'm very confused! 
thanks
