my emachines desktop with windows xp crashed, due to missing or corrupted ntoskrnl.exe. 
now every time i turn on the pc, there's just an emachines logo, a black screen and the missing/corrupt message. 
i have the emachines recovery cd but the pc doesn't read it. 
i popped it in and out but my pc doesn't seems to recognize the disk. 
it keeps asking me to re-install a copy of the missing/corrupt file but i can't do so without it reading the recovery cd. it also didn't allow me to type in any commands. 
when asked to re-install ntoskrnl.exe, 
if i press any key, the pc would just reboot and then return to the error message. 
i also tried pressing f11 or r and it activates a recovery program. 
it gives me 2 options, to either format or back up the whole thing. 
i can only mouse-click this so again, no command can be typed in. 
no matter what i choose, the pc would just shut down every 4-5 minutes. 
i've tried this more than 20 times and every single time, the pc would just shut down in the middle of formatting or backing up. 
it displayed a blue screen saying that it needs to shut down to prevent damage. 
there's also a string of number, i forgot to write it down but i think it was 0x00000023. 
so i have the recovery cd but can't use it to fix the missing/corrupted ntoskrnl.exe. 
i also have access to the recovery program but can't do much because the computer reboot every 5 minutes. 
i don't know what wrong or what i should do next. 
please help!
