i'm not the one to give you the answer to the various security levels, but i have the same hardware as you and did have the same problem. 
i disabled security and used mac filtering and have had no problems since. 
mine is a home network and there were only to other networks in my area and both were 'secure'. 
i figure that mac filtering will stop the guy with a laptop driving down my street looking for unsecured networks.
