1. did you try the old cover off tests? 
2. i'm seeing 8800 and 9800 video cards failing now. 
do you have another card to swap in if the cover off test doesn't show any changes? 
3. &quot;six 12v rails&quot; now comes the really hard question. 
if this has six rails, how did you balance them? 
and this is why i tell folk to get single rail power supplies. 
to avoid learning this the hard way.
