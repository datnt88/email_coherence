...the windows firewall is turned off on both machines. 
the router is not a router, but rather a linksys switch, so no way to set it to dhcp. the ethernet cards are configured with a static ip on the same subnet. 
again, i can ping each machine from the other, but i can't map a drive. 
this is extremely frustrating, as i have never had this problem before and i can't seem to figure it out. 
does anyone have any more ideas. 
what should be a simple procedure has become a pain in the............ any and all help appreciated!
