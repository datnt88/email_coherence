ok, sorry. 
i guess i am not as &quot;networking savy&quot; as i thought. 
i know very basic concepts and am not a real it person. 
i don't have the option of buying another machine, or learning linux. the one computer must operate on both networks simultaneously. 
the application this is used for is very &quot;restrictive&quot; in nature and must be secure, and must run with xp pro. 
i do not currently have a machine to &quot;play with&quot; that has dual network adapters, however, i need to figure out how to make this happen. 
any help would be appreciated, but consider that i am most likely a novice (at best) when dealing with networking
