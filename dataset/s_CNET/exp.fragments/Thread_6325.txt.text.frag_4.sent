use an online fax service instead. 
i don't think you can automatically send and receive fax from your computer using an all-in-one fax/scanner/printer machine. 
you still need to get up from your desk and fax your document the usual way. 
on the other hand, an online fax service is painless because you don't have to leave your seat and you can fax from your desktop. 
it's cheaper and more accessible too as you can get your fax from anywhere with internet access. 
all your fax go straight to your email so you always have a copy. 
i've been using internet fax from onesuite for quite sometime now and its better than traditional fax.
