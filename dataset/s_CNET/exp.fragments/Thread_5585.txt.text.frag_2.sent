is &quot;clocked&quot; at motherboard level and is accessed by devices that need it. 
it's speed is not independent of the rest of your system as it must work with it. 
you might have some control over clock speed through your bios or mb jumpers in some cases (mostly older boards). 
you should be able to see your processor speed setting in your bios. 
your ram modules should have an spd component which is used by your bios to determine it's capabilites and optimize their performance. 
check your bios to see if these setting have been set manually. 
if so, set them to something that refers to spd.
