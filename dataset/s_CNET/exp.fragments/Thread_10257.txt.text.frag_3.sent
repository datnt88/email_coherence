you hit the physical limitations of some device. 
in most case std. 
office devices may not suffice. 
not knowing what your funds are, it far better to ask the pros on this topic. 
if this is a common request, then the solution is already known. 
what, i have found is contacting commercial sources and/or business that deal with such needs and query there. 
i offer that as while i've fixed many pcs and devices there is a level of commercial needs that goes beyond what if part of the typical desktops. 
there i'm sure business offering the service and will allow to ask what can be had to fulfill the need in order to get your possible business. 
though you need not buy from them. 
aren't there any trade papers that offer such services/devices?
