as my music collection was over 60gb, and i only had 80 gb disc space on my laptop it just seemed a waste to keep it all on the laptop. 
i unfortunately formatted my 40gb ipod just recently and was able to retrieve only 20gb worth of music from it. 
so anything i can do to get the data back? 
any program? 
last time this happened with my old harddrive i ended up paying 200 ($400) to retrieve the data. 
i dont want to do this all over again. 
i am happy to pay for an effective program and be able to use it if this ever happens again. 
also, anyone has an answer why this keeps happening? 
could it be a virus which creates bad clusters?
