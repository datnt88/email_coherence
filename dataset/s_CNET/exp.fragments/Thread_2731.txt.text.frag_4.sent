while changing the monitor for another for a test is a great idea, an old server at the office with a cirrus logic pci card failed. 
the video card was the culprit. 
mind you i am strictly sharing this one occurance (out of hundreds) but you are reaching the end of life on the parts in said box and may have to search out replacements. 
-&gt; do try opening the box and dusting it out in case it's a heat induced issue.
