read the above posts. 
you cannot combine 2 networks to get higher download using only the windows. 
by default windows will only use a single connection. 
if you work at it you can make it use one connection to download from say utube and the other to download from say netflicks but you cannot combine them to get greater speed. 
there are companies will try to sell you services to do this but it in general is not worth the costs compared to buying a larger connection from a isp.
