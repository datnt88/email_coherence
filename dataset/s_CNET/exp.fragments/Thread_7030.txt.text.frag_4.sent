basically i need it for documenting patient history and physical exams the template would be something like this: chief complaint: (a few words) history of present illness: (a few sentences) past medical history: (words) etc some portions would look like this with checkboxes: ()hyperthyroidism ()hypertension ()diabetes ()cancer ()chf ()pneumonia ()etc ()etc ()etc i was hoping to find a program for a tablet so its less &quot;cold or rude&quot; when doing patient interviews to be typing while interviewing and yet still be able to write it out while i'm actually talking to the patient otherwise i can be left with several patient notes to write several hours later that will take several hours to do versus getting them done on the spot but i am starting to think what i'm looking for doesn't exist yet, or that it won't work as well as i need it to.
