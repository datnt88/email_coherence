buying a power supply can be tricky. 
you'll find the same wattage power supply for sale at prices ranging from $20 to $220. 
why not buy the cheap one ? 
or use the ps that came with your case ? 
cheap power supplies fail, and often they will destroy your motherboard, hard drive, and pretty much everything. 
honestly, it's just not worth it. 
plan on spending at least $80 for a 350w or better power supply. 
it will be money well spent. 
good brands i've bought are bfg and antec, there are others that are good, too.
