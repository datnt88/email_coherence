hello my wre54g is giving me problems. 
whenever i try to log into the webpage to configure it (192.168.1.240) it does not load. 
i have it wired to my router (wrt150n) and have tried accessing it from a windows 7 wireless connection and a windows vista ethernet connection. 
but both can't access the page. 
i have tried holding the reset button for 15 seconds and still the same thing. 
i was able to access it before but had to reset it for some reasons... anyone with some help??? thanks, tony
