this is a desktop computer using a wireless nic internally, it has wifi capabilities though and i can confirm it isnt the single computer because it shuts off on all 3 computers connected to the network and an iphone. 
i am incapable of wiring any devices to the router though sadly. 
so it looks like i'm screwed.
