the way it's set up is 2 screws on 1 side, and 1 screw in the other side. 
that's what the bay allows. 
and no i'm not 100% sure it was the hard drive. 
it could have probably been a number of things, it's just at the time i was installing the hard drive since i got the 300 watt power supply at a local shop (not enough connector's though, but that's in another post ). the system isn't shaking much now but it was before. 
it's just humming along nicely. 
i probably will look into either the washers or these things i saw at the computer shop that are plastic and go around the power supply and some for the drives to reduce shaking or whatever.
