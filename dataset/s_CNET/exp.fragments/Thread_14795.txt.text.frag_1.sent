i've got a 6yr old presario,windows 98. over the years i've installed 'turbotax' software programs for taxes. 
ever year the newer program i install pulls information from the previous years program. 
its now time for me to get a new computer and i want to install last years tax program onto the newer computer when i get it. 
i've seen these portable storage drive things that are about the size of a lighter advertised at 'staples'.....reasonably priced @ $30 area. 
i assume it plugs into my usb port. 
does anyone have experiance with these or know if these things would hold my whole tax program? 
i'm open to other solutions. 
thanks.
