i find the geocities/yahoo to be fairly painless. 
but let's be clear here, if the scanner fails on another machine, cost of repair (including shipping) exceeds the cost of a new scanner. 
parts outside of an external usb/parallel cable or a wall power supply are not obtainable. 
well, lamps are, but not much else. 
bottomline? 
try it on another machine?
