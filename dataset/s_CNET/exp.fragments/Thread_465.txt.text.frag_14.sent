the computer i use most of the time (and the one i am using right now) is a gateway laptop that i got in july for $400 off the regular price. 
it has a core 2 duo t5600, and 3 gb of pc2-5300 ddr2, running vista home premium. 
i hated vista until i got this unit. the fact that it came with service pack 1 helped (i still refuse to touch 64-bit vista), as does this machine's power. 
i have two other computers of my own, one of which came with vista home premium, and the other with home basic. 
both of them are now running xp pro, because i couldn't stand the performance and instability. 
even downloading sp1 fixed nothing; it doesn't seem to do any good unless it comes pre-installed. 
one is 2 years old, and the other about 1 year old.
