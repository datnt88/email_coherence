&quot;i'm just gona suggest she buy a new motherboard for it.&quot; today's ghz monsters will not run on that power supply. 
for under 30usd, you can find 450 watt power supplies, you'll need new ram, the hard disk is likely small/slow and the list may not stop there. 
save yourself big headaches now. 
do more research.
