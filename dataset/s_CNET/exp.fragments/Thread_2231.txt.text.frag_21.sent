usually, the higher the screen resolution is, the better the image is. 
so, the maximun resolution offered by the monitor should be used. the monitor's aspect ratio is important here. 
for gaming and watching hd movies, an aspect ratio of 16:9 is prefered. 
for general pc usage, a 8:5 (16:10) aspect ratio is better. the resolution used for gaming also depends on the power of the gpu. 
putting all these into consideration, a 24 inch monitor with an aspect ratio of 8:5 used at a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a good choice for general usage, gaming and watching hd movies..
