guys, my plan is to set the camera to the absolute lowest setting. 
in the range of 10,000 bytes per photo or less if possible. 
remote desktop actually works reasonably well with the resolution and colors turned down. 
i havent had a chance to try the camera, yet. 
once i get this networking problem solved. 
any ideas on that? 
thanks
