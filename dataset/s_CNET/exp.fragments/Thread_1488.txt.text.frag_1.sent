i have a slightly older laptop that has xp and i'm thinking of upgrading to vista home prem. 
i ran several tests to see if my laptop is &quot;vista ready&quot; including the one from ms and they said my laptop passes in everything but the nvidia site told me no because of the following: mobile intel 845gm express chipset family (intel gma950) video hw transform & lighting required (don't have) vertex shader ver required 2.0 (my ver is 0.0) i should note that ms upgrade advisor told me it was ok to move to vista home prem which is what i want. 
based on my intel chipset specs do you think it could run aero i/f? 
thanks in advance.
