hello folks, now that back-to-school sales are running high, i thought of getting a printer for my occasional printing needs. 
i need black and white printer only, no fancy features required as long as it does its printing job well. 
i plan to refill ink from places like cartridgeworld or similar, hence i am looking for a printer that is cheap to refill as well. 
i will be glad if i could get some recommendations. 
many thanks in advance.
