why is it an issue? 
because some people utilize their computers 24 hours a day. the only time my computers are off is when i am away on an extended vacation. 
and i only reboot when the systems require it as in microsoft's update tuesday. 
do i consider saving electricity so i can feel better about myself? 
not on your life! 
coal and oil are here for a reason and that reason is to use them. 
when those commodities eventually run out (3 or 4 hundred or so years down the road), there will be a suitable replacement and it will be cheap. 
do i know what that is? 
not yet. and if i did know, i certainly would not tell you!
