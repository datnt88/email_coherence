i got two dell computers almost two years ago (yes,i know) dell desktop dimension 520 p4 3ghz 2gbram 2hd 320gb nvidia graphics dell laptop inspiron 1501 2gb ram 120gb hd radeon xpress graphics i must say both machines perform quiet well taking into account some of the dell particulars. 
they both came with winxp prof installed and after looking around i decided against win vista and went for linux instead. 
very good experience (after some initial trial and error stuff)running smoothly on a multiboot between winxp and 14 linuxes divided between the two pc's. 
happy man!
