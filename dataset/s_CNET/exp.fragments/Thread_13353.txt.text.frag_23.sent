win7 should work but i'll presume you have xp and it doesn't recognize sata drives with bios set to &quot;enhanced&quot; or &quot;achi&quot; modes. 
you either set the bios to ide mode (which might be called pata or &quot;legacy&quot;) or you have the motherboard's 3rd party driver handy while pressing f6 when asked during the installation. 
xp installs only accept floppy disks for these drivers. 
you'd have to rely on your motherboard driver package to have this disk or for the cd rom to have the &quot;makedisk&quot; utility which can create a floppy for the enhanced mode drivers.
