built this computer for a friend and they where havign issues with it rebooting for no appernt reason. 
so i got the computer back from them installed a after market cpu fan thinking it was possibly a heat issue, and formatted and reinstalled windows just in case it had a possible virus. 
while i was installing windows it rebooted one time and i had to restart the install. 
then i got it installed got everything updated got avg/adware/spybot on it and updated. 
then i took the computer back to the friend house and while i was settign it up for them it rebooted again on me, and sevreal more times while i was trying to do other things. 
when i submitted the error reports to microsoft it spit back one of two things, driver error source unknown and possibly a memory problem. 
but once again it coulnt pin point anything on ethier of the error reports. 
i know its not a virus, so im thinking its etheir a hardware issue or a driver issue. 
possible bad memory. 
any ideas as how to pin point the problem would be greatly helpful.
