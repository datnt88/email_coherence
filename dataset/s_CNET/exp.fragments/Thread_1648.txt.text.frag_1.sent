i was doing some digging and found that in many instances, the core i750 gets nearly equal performance with the core i7 920 in games for both single card and sli configurations. 
the 920 has hyper threading but i am not sure what the significance of this is because the threads aren't actual physical threads i am considering an upgrade and the i5 setup would be much cheaper, but i don't know if the performance is truly equal could anybody comment on this?
