i was having the same problem with my computer. 
i even had it into the repair shop and they could find nothing wrong with it. 
this gave me the idea that it must be caused by something that i had connected to the computer. 
so i disconnected everything and then started plugging them in one at a time. 
bingo! 
when i got to the card reader, it started to restart again. 
this was the culprit and by buying a new card reader, my problem was fixed!
