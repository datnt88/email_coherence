just over at my dad's house and a cdrw drive had failed. the machine worked pretty well, except for a long boot time (over 5 minutes.) i spotted a clue it was the cdrw and for a test boot, shut off the power, unplugged the suspected ide cdrw and the machine booted in less than one minute. 
you have to try such things and look for any clue you can. in closing, many machines i see are &quot;badly configured.&quot; 
yes they work, but it's just bad practice to have a cdrw on the second channel as slave and no master.
