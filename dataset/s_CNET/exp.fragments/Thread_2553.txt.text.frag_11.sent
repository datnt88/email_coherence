from your link, i found &quot;repair windows xp by repairing a repair install&quot; and &quot;xp repair install free&quot; which lead me to windows-fix.tuneup360.com&quot; and &quot;xp repair install -cam 2000&quot; could you be more specific on precisely which choice to make. 
i must download a program which i can use on my currently &quot;crashed&quot; computer. 
i must be able to boot from my floppy drive. 
i have an external floppy drive. 
i doubt if i can use this. 
internal floppy drives (refurbished) are cheap and easy to install, but will require a trip to a computer shop which sells one. 
in addition, i have found they are not generic. 
i am using an internal floppy purchased from dell because the &quot;generic&quot; drive i purchased locally does not have the data/power cable configuration which fits my computer. 
i would not mind the $20 expense, but cost of excursion must be considered. 
perhaps i can download the required software program and send it as an email attachment to the &quot;learning&quot; unit. 
i would still be able to boot the computer somehow, presumably from the a drive. 
i have &quot;setup&quot; diskettes (6). 
that is my next step. 
i have previously backed up the data from this computer, none of which is crucial, knowing i was just &quot;learning&quot;. thus i have nothing to lose here. 
i will await any further suggestions.
