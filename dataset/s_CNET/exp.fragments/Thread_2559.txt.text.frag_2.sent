i have a gateway media center, which has a dvd drive, cd drive, and can be setup for a tv. i bought mine at bestbuy. 
i knew nothing about computers but my son knew pretty much about them, so he went with. 
i needed the whole package, monitor,etc. 
if you know someone who can go with you and knows computers that would help. 
i suggest getting one with alot of memory, etc. and ask alot of questions from the salesperson. 
if they do not answer your questions or if they seem bothered by your questions, go someplace else. it also depends on how much your willing to spend. 
my computer alone was $1,100 without all the extras, (monitor,etc.) i liked my gateway so much that my family bought my other son a gateway for his birthday.
