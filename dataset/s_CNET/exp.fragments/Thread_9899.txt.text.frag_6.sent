your reply was extremely helpful. 
yes, i am a gd for money - although part-time but asiring for full-time, self-employed. the local gig was asking around $1300 for the system listed. 
i was thinking about trying dell but thought it would be a pain to get serviced -- if i had to send it back to them, for example. 
i will ask about the upgrade to 2 gb or ram adn ddr2-800. 
i would love to find someone local that could just put the components together for me...but haven't found a reputable person yet. the local shop also suggested raid1 -- which i was planning on getting. 
how do you feel about the core duo quad? 
i don't do 3d renders so one of your card suggestions will probably work fine. 
i do have 2 monitors i like and to date haven't had finished [printed projects] render differently than what my monitors do. 
so, i'll keep them for now. 
again, your input was extremely enlightening.
