&quot;the question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an atx tower, thus always a standby voltage?&quot; 
i can't see how this can be answered with the laptop designs being so varied. 
i will answer yes on my newest hp dv6910us since you can turn it off and on via a small ir remote control. 
to do that, some circuit has to be energized.
