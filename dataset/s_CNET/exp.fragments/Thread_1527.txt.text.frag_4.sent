set your tools/folder options/view to display hidden and system files if you have not already done so. 
look in the root folder of your boot drive (usually c: but not always with xp). 
look for a file called &quot;pagefile.sys&quot; and not its size. 
now shut down and remove one stick of ram. 
reboot and see if the pagefile gets smaller. 
if so, that's probably where your space went.
