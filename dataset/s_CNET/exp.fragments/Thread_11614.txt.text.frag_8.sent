finally i solved my problem, it was after all the power supply problem. 
i bought a new power supply and my computer is alive again. 
even though no burnt smell and the fuse is still intact the power supply is not working as it should be. 
i wonder what could have caused it to break down. 
i also bought an avr (automatic voltage regulator) for protection. 
actually this is the 3rd power supply i have installed on my computer. 
these are of swithcing mode type. 
i don't know if that kind of power supply could have caused it to break down or the electrical spikes in our house since i don't use a good surge protector or an avr. 
anyway thanks for all those who responded to my problem.
