i had thought about partitioning the hard drive with 120gb for the primary and 40gb for data, backups etc. but maybe that is not a good idea for this laptop. 
i did it with my desktop. 
i will be away from my computer for the next 24 hours and at that time i will do an update based on what people have said and on additional searching that l have done.
