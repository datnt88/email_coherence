part of the strength of os x is that its core, and a bunch of other places, is protected against what you are trying to do to it. 
this is one of the many reasons that there are currently no virus's for os x. to delete the files you have to have access to them and have the rights to read/write and delete. 
you are going to have to boot from the cd to install os x so i would not be too quick to blow away the hd. the os x installer will not install to the drive that it is mounted on. 
i would continue my efforts to boot from the cd. have you tried inserting the cd, mounting it on the desktop, going to system preferences, choosing the cd as the startup disk and then restarting?? if not, try it. 
you are going to have to boot from the cd eventually.
