&quot;dedicated single +12v rail with user-configurable virtual &quot;single rail&quot; and &quot;multi-rail&quot; software modes&quot; it appears that you have choices in the psu area to make. 
as i didn't design this computer i can't answer which mode is appropriate. 
i can't see the machine so i can't tell if the issue is the power or cooling. 
try it without the cover and the video card in another slot.
