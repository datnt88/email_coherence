hello, i never had this problem before and i can't find any possible settings that would be causing it. 
i have a motorola surfboard modem that is connected to my dd-wrt 54g wireless router. 
if i put in my external ip address in the browser while connected to my wireless network, it directs me to the correct local ip that i have it set to. 
if i try to access it outside my network it just times out and says &quot;response error. 
technical description: 502 bad gateway - response error, a bad response was received from another proxy server or the destination origin server&quot; any ideas of what i can look for? 
thanks!
