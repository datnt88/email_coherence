did a check and found no w2k drivers at epson's support website. 
there are windoze nt3.x and nt4, you can try that to see if it works. 
but, it appears the 800 model is too old and maybe considered only for win9x system. 
its time to move-on, unless someone posts a deeper resolution to your problem. 
in many cases, no work around. 
that model printer just isn't supported no more into newer oses. 
sorry tada -----willy
