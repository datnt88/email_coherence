hi steve, as twesterh indicates, &quot;the gateway is technically the better computer as it has better specs and more features.&quot; the 827gm also has the athlon 64 3500 processor which has more power that gamers like. 
since you repeatedly post that you do not do gaming, then the lower priced (especially when on sale) t6212 without upgrading the graphics or ram would be suited for you imo. also steve, the emachines t6212 is more in competition/comparison with the hp sr1010z in features & price..... the gateway 827gm is more in comparison to the gateway 825gm and others like: hp m7070n hp m7060n hp m1297c
