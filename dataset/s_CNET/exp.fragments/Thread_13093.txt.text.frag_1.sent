hello i have recently changed hard drives as my older hard drive was too small. 
i used a cloning program and it worked without a hitch. 
i kept the partition between o/s and data but proportionately bigger. 
recently i lost data & want to reconnect old hd to transfer the lost data across. 
unfortunately it asked for a boot disk which i don't have nor a floppy drive. 
do i need one? 
will the o/s on older hd conflict when both old & new hd are connected? 
can anyone shed some light? 
regards illya ps. o/s = xp home edition
