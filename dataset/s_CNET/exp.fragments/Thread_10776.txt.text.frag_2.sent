problem. do you have a video card or is it an onboard video?? if it is a card, reinsert it. the agp slot is very tight and it is easy for a card to come loose if it was not absolutely fully inserted. 
your statement; &gt;&gt;a couple of days ago i got a system error message during xp's startup. 
it told me to proceed. 
i clicked yes, and it looked like it entered safe mode (4 bit, 640 x 480).&lt;&lt;&lt; it told you to proceed or it offered proceeding as one option??? was it actually in safe mode??? in safe mode the words safe mode are shown in all four corners of the screen. 
when does the beeping occur?? during boot a video problem can be one cause of the beep. 
as to the hard drive. 
does you have smart drive enabled in the bios?? if enabled it is pretty good at alerting one to potential hard drive problems before it is too late.
