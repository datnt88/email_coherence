if you have had that computer for a while and you haven't cleaned the dust out yet, i suggest you do so. 
my p4 3.0c computer dropped about 10c after using a can of compressed air on all case filters, all fans, and all heatsinks. 
you may have to remove the cpu heatsimk fan to do a good job on that heatsink.
