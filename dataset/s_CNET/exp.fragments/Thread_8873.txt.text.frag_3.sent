at 86 years old,i know a lot about how things go bad...not happy when they do within 8-9 months of purchase making my sensitive &quot;stuff&quot; available to eyes of strangers if sent for repair. 
have other backups of the stuff, so that's not the problema. 
wanted to erase ere' sending to texas... sytem crash prevented... can't know if personal data vulnerable. 
&quot;device&quot; has disappointed, but when it worked, it was good; acer support service questionable. 
know i can &quot;shred&quot; the &quot;thing&quot; any time, but being a great depression boy, try my best to salvage a bad situation and cost. 
even at 86, will keep tilting at windmills a while longer . 
thanks.
