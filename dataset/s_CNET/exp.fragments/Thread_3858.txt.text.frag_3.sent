understand that &quot;airflow&quot; is important to maintain a well cooled system. 
its always good insurance to have adqueate yet properly placed fan(s) and/or water cooling system. the whole purpose to keep componets within operating specs and prevent any heat related stress, otherwise things start to go downhill. 
if you have the option to install yet another fan via the mtrbd. 
or directly to power harness plug, do it, its cheap insurance. 
beware, any power demands of any kind to add up, so a decent power supply is a must. 
fyi - i have a 5200nvida chipset as well, but it does use a fan to keep it cool. 
i'm sure yours uses a rather large heatsink. 
thus, it needs a well cooled system case to help control its own &quot;passive cooling&quot;, ok. enjoy -----willy
