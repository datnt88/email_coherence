i guess i'm showing my ignorance, i didn't realise they put in a separate head for each platter, but there's still switching involved. 
my point is i only need 20g of storage and if there's 2 platters with 2 heads on a 320g that seems like an overkill unless the platters themselves are different from the single platter on the 160g. 
from what i've read it sounds like they use the same platters...
