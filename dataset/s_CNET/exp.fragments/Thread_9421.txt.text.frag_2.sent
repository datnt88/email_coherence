wow is my first reaction. 
my second is wow again! 
i don't think i have ever ran across that but having said that, my guess is a virus can be the cause. 
you did not mention what type of files are taking up your disk space? 
also, are you able to remove them? 
i would check the &quot;services&quot; file under administrative tools very closely and determine any suspicious entries. 
it took half a day to help fix a friends laptop that was saturated with trojans, spyware, uname it and i found several entries in the services file. 
these hackers set the recovery of their programs to 4977 times to restart!!!
