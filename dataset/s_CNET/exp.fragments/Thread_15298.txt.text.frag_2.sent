you will need to verify the physical sizing aspects of the new mtrbd. 
but in most cases they follow the baby atx size factor, to include the required mounting holes. 
you need to consider buying yet another psu to help power it all when done. the current psu maybe too skippy on power, probable 250-300w unit thus typical new system is in the 500w range or better. 
you may want to try the new psu just to see if it corrects the present problem. 
that and getting the feel for the repair/swap process. 
otherwise, for the cost of new rebuild system, you can check pricing on new entry level systems. 
they are quite decent now in price for the xmas season and selling before the end of the yr.. at least compare it all to a total diy project.
