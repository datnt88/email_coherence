hi, this is a friends network and i was volunteered to help so don't have constant access to it. 
i have it set up ssid broadcasting but with wep. the www from desktop browser works and that is how i did config of wireless security. 
the client laptop connects just fine...just gets dropped when another wireless device is detected. 
i have been reading that the iphones and blackberrys cause problems for ap/routers. 
just thought someone would have been there done that with this problem. 
next visit to their house i am going to change the channel and do a firmware update. 
thanks -lige
