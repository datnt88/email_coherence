what you meant by that, as far as i could tell you meant take the old board and put it on the new hard drive? 
well whatever drive the board is on the broken component still produces smoke when turned on. 
the problem is that the new hard drive works fine, but when i take the board off the new hard drive and put it on the old drive, it just goes in the cycle of power up and power down.
