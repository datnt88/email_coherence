so far i'm hearing no bd/br play for non-hdcp systems. 
and many other sites note this. 
but hey, it's your money to prove them wrong. 
while the usual ati5450 would be my choice given the non-gamer use, i do have better cards ready to talk about. 
do this -&gt; set the price you want to pay and then pick one at that price from this link. 
once you pick out the card we'll check the power supply rating.
