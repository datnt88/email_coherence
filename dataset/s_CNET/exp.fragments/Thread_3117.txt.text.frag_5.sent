frankly? i'd replace the drive and move on. 
here, an 60 or 80gb laptop drive can be found for 99 bucks. 
cheap compared to other avenues. 
still want to save the drive? 
let me state that if the heads have crashed (rare!) then the crash scraped off the coating and the data is long gone. 
given that, i'd buy spinrite and let it at the drive. 
cheers, bob
