cable is not digital. 
it's an analog signal that carries digital information. 
it's a common selling point, but a little investigation will reveal the truth. 
because of the bandwidth involved, a great picture can be received, and the leftover is available for internet. 
but i digress. 
get the tuner card. 
a good one can be had for under a hundred bucks. 
don't spend a load on an expensive card to view on a 17&quot; monitor, it's just not worth it. 
visit the better internet selling sites, shop around. 
i like buy.com and newegg.com. 
there are others in abundance. 
do a google search on tuner cards. 
wayne give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
