i'm actually just one apartment in a building and neighbourhood with literally tons of wifi including a citywide net just going online. 
i've tried multiple channels to no avail. 
can i assume if i'm the strongest signal on a channel occupied with other people that i'll have the least problem? 
compared to being on a channel with someone else who has an equally strong signal?
