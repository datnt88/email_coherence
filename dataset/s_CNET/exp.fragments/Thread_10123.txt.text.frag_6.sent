time for a reality check: if you're going with a 3-way sli with top/near-top of the line graphics cards... why, pray tell, would you care to overclock? is there something you're doing on the machine that isn't just games? 
dual sli with 8800 or 9800 anything will handle any game that's been made or is on the horizon. 
triple, if you can keep it stable, will play just as well. 
overclocked triple, will play just as well. 
not better, just as well. 
'cuz if you're at max settings with 30+ fps, it looks the same as 60 fps. 
overcompensating for something?
