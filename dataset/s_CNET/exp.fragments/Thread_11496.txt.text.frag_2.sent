the best advise is to stay away from mix-and-match. 
you are better off running the same brand of router and card(s). 
i use the belkin pren and have had no problems with it other than interferrence with like-frequency wireless phones. 
that was an easy problem to take care of. 
range with the belkin pren is very good and yes, it does support older/non-pren cards, however if you want to maximize your range and speed, then use pren cards with the router.
