with each new discussion it is a new discussion. 
this way the discussion starts unpolluted from prior discussions. 
dancing mice pointers are not fun to deal with. 
even more so if it's the laptop pad. 
for years i've used simple solutions like external mice, no drivers with great success. 
however once in a while you encounter some that what the mouse pad to be fixed. 
for that we must deal with the product's maker as there is no other place to go.
