my big complication is that according to my pc specs at least that i found on cnet)...i only have pci express x16 1.0. 
and most 9 series are pci express 2.0. the only card that is 9 series and pci express 1.0 is: galaxy 95tge8hufexx geforce 9500 gt 1gb (newegg.com 
$82) but according to this post, i can use pci-e 2.0 in my pc: this seems like it might be a recipe for disaster putting a pci-e 2.0 card in there. 
or at the very least it won't function properly. 
if this is true, then id get something like this: evga 01g-p3-n959-tr geforce 9500 gt 1gb (newegg.com 
$70) asus en9500gt top/di/512m geforce 9500 gt 512mb (newegg.com 
$80) galaxy geforce 9600 gt video card - 1gb ddr3, (tigerdriect.com 
$105) any thoughts appreciated.
