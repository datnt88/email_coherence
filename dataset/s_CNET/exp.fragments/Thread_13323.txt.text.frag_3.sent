i'm not sure of your skill...but you should have a brown 3&quot; slot next to the pci slots.that's a respectable card in agp form(im on a 7600gs 512,lol),but if you have the pci-x model,definitely get a new board.pc 
hardware is getting real cheap. 
you can get a decent board for 50 bucks or less...problem is,you'll need new ram (cheapest is $50 for 4 gigs),and a new cpu,...at least.
