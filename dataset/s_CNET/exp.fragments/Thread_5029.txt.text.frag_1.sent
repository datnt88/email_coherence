do any of the us model galaxy tabs actually come with the sim card slot? 
i just bought the verizon tab with a pay as you go plan for the first few months, with the intent to get it unlocked and use it in australia (permanently) upon return. 
the salesguy at best buy said i'd be able to do this, but in researching this, it appears that this model doesn't even have a sim card slot. 
any advice as to which tablet i should get until i go back (4 months)? 
i didn't think i could use a country-specific sim card for the i-pad since it is so proprietary and thought the galaxy would be more flexible. 
help please!!!
