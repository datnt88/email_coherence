hi, i have a wireless network at home set up with the gateway wgr-200 router. 
i'm having trouble accessing 1 particular site (page not found). 
when i bypass the router completely, i can access the site. 
so i think the router's built-in firewall is blocking the site. 
how do i unblock this site? 
i can't find where i can configure the router's firewall. 
i can access the router's set-up page via the http link, but i don't see any option for configuring the firewall. 
i'm using windows xp, with a desktop, laptop and cable modem. 
thanks in advance, ed
