whew! you did not list the athlon 64 x2 as &quot;yesterday&quot;. 
computers are always gaining in development. 
even tho that some systems are &quot;yesterday&quot;, they will still work as great for the next several years. 
this computer i've been considering is an athlon 64 x2. its affordable with nice specs. 
what you think? 
i compared it with a gaming computer and found that the gaming computer i was looking at cost more, because of fancy case design.
