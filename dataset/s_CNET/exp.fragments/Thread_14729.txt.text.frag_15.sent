heat is the most common &quot;wear&tear&quot; effect on eletronic componets. 
the other is mismatched voltages and/or beyond tolerances. 
heat is *always* doing damage buut if with specs the effects only come after long usage or if beyond tolerances for prolonged times, begin more immediately. 
i exclude any marginal componet which do come down the pike during manufacture. 
heat alone can overtime cause a problem. the ffects are the lag time of display of reduced ram management unable to keep-up. 
further, some driver s/w has caused similar problems and only a driver update corrects this if at all, as physical systems vary. 
all-in-all, things work well but if pushed easily are toppled. 
ask any gamer what seems to be a problem and most decry this or that, but the real cause is they're pushing thier systems to the limit and further don't want to relish anything to decrease gameply. 
usually only better compoents(equipment) or faster this or that does well and that means &quot;top-shelf&quot; items, pricey.
