hello cnet my specs are: case: corsair obsidian 650d ram: corsair vengeance xms3 - 16gb@2133mhz graphic: msi twinfrozr 780 cpu: i7 4770k haswell@3.5ghz 
cpu cooler: corsair h100i ssd: corsair 180gb gs power supply: corsair ax760i motherboard: asus maximus vi hero - socket 1150 monitor: benq xl2411t @ 144mhz ----- my problem today is, i just finished building the pc myself and when i run a game like grid 2 or metro: last light it does not take more than 5minutes and my pc shuts totally down, then it tries to reboot as it does not happen, it shuts down once more even before showing anything on the screen from first attempt to reboot, and then it reboots again and starts up and works again - i do not have any clue to what this problem could be, none of the games i play lagg or show any sign of as the system should be running hot or with defect, it just suddenly stops working as result of the shutdown i have tried: to test the psu(as it has a selftest button, it should run fine as the test shows) to remove 2 of the 4 sticks of ram, to see if this would make a difference. 
when i first got the pc i ran a 12hour 'stress test' on the cpu where it's avrg. 
tempature was around 37-42(celsius that is) ---- when i run a game like gta iv(which is from 2008) in max settings this error does not occour and it runs nice and smooth ---- if anybody knows !anything! to what this problem could be or has had the same error when they've build a pc themselves - please post your solution to your problem thank you in advance.
