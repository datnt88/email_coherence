i have a xerox 470cx printer, scanner, copier, and fax machine that a friend gave me. 
i downloaded the drivers, and everything works fine, but i do not have the manual. 
i tried to download the pdf file from xerox's website, but it locks up. 
my problem is scanning. 
i'm using windows 98 imaging program to scan with. the scanner (twain) works great, but after i scan something the program closes and there is no image in the imaging program. 
i can't print, or save anything! 
i mean where does it go, and what file name is it under? 
xerox tech. 
support says it saves it to the hard drive, but where on my hard drive? 
not in xerox's folder. 
thanks.
