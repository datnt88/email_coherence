i didn't know where to start with the print sever on this setup. 
i just knew that the modem should be in bridged mode and the router should be left to do the address translations. 
i've never seen a setup with double nating before, so i thought something was wrong. 
he's trying to connect a wireless linksys print server when he already has a wireless router. 
should just be a non-wireless print server. 
i think i may leave that one alone.
