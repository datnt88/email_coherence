i only have 1 open pci-e slot, and i've only seen the geforce in agp, so are there any cards that i could use that's pci-e? 
and i was actually thinking just getting a whole new psu wouldn't be completely out of the idea, so are there any psu's that could fit? 
i have searched around on the net and really didn't get any answers...
