take a look at some of the box stores to see what is offered, there should be a lot of them out there. 
places such as office depot or staples would be good starting points. 
the new i-5 or i-7 7 intel or the amd quad core processor would do the job coupled with enough ram, 8 gb's or more, basic onboard graphics should be good enough, if not most have slots to input a stand alone video cards, should that be needed.
