newegg is where to focus. the product is defective and the money went from you to newegg. 
if by cc, call them and explain that the product was defective from day one and what to do next. 
i've used far too many routers but the recurring advice is to use our forum's preferred settings. 
if you already replaced it, then back to the cc company.
