how have you got them jumpered? 
change the old slave to a master and the old master as a slave or both as cable select. 
it should boot in normal order and should recognize the second drive, which you will have to format. 
you may need to change the drive designation d to c before you do this. 
i'm assuming the setup is recognizing both drives and still seeing your old master as master and your old slave as slave and thast the boot order includes booting from a secondary drive?
