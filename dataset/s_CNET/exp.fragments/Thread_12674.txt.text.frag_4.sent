most games today suppport dual core cpus, but only a few support quad cores. 
they can still run on quads, but can't take advantage of all of the cores. 
i think games like crysis and maybe bioshock hev full quad support. 
in other games that don't fully support quads (most games) people find that dual core processors outperform them. 
really all comes down to pc games. 
there aren't very many other things you can do with your computer that would require a quad core (vieo editing?).
