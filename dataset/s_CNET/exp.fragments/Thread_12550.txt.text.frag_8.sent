threat the 3.5in. 
card reader like a floppy drive, they're practically the same size. 
any adapter for possible 3.5-to-5.25 
bay opening is also possible. 
your case, may need to be disassembled for ease of access for both items for final assembly. 
also, i have found removing the card reader frt. 
panel may help(most clip-in). 
return when done. i don't what is causing your problem unless you have an unique situation. 
if the grill cut-out you mention is suppose to mount, it probably requires a flat surface or direct to be flush as in left alone. the case may &quot;surround&quot; it but it should seat in the case itself, flush to the outside of bay. 
-or- that face plate is 5.25 mounting to surround the card reader as in extra venting. 
but, if not in 5.25 bay, it becomes extra part. 
unless, you provide direct install pictures and not part links, maybe it could explain better. 
from what you've provided it isn't clear yet, other than what i explained maybe the problem.
