i'm transitioning to wireless n for my home network to facilitate streaming hd video and basically speed everything up. 
we still have 1 computer that runs wireless g and often have guests that may have g as well. 
is it possible to hook a cheap wireless g access point like the belkin f5d7132 to my new wireless n router? 
my understanding is that running mixed g/n from the router will degrade the overall performance. 
i'm assuming that running a seperate g access point connected by ethernet will allow the router to remain 100% n but maintain g access.
