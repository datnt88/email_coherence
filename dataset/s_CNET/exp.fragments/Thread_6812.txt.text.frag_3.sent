i have one of these devices. 
after i bought it i went through the same thing you are going through. 
i could not get it to connect wirelessly (even with all of the up dates) or wired to other dlink devices. 
i finally ended up giving it away to a friend that owns a coffee house for use as an internet access point for customers. 
he has to reboot it about 6 times a day to even get it to work as an access point (not even as a router). 
if you can return it your should return as soon as possible and replace it the belkin 125 unit. 
i worked with the di624 for about 2 months and it never worked right. 
i've got 3 belkin wireless units and have not had any trouble with them. 
one of them (802.11b) has been running now without reboot for about 18 months. 
they are easy to set up and they work.
