first time i used ms office was on a mac se before the &quot;office&quot; concept using word, excel, and later powerpoint. 
i think ms developed word and excel for the mac before the pc. it is good they get back to their roots. 
i've been delaying buying a tablet because i like the android os, but i like the full functionality of excel. 
i hate switching back and forth between excel and pseudo-excel worksheets.
