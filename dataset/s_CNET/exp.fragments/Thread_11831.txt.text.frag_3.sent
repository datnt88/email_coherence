the new hard drive sounds pretty interesting. 
i don't want to go through the reconfiguring of all my browsers, clients and so forth. 
let's not even think about the docs! it doesn't have to be that large of a hd. i'll check ebay and also look at upgrades. 
bob, have you got any microsoft certs? 
any advice on the exams?
