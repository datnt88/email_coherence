hi everyone, i need to buy a graphic card for my pc, mainly to play video games. the problem i have is that the pc only has a pcie x1 and the card has to be low profile (i know that sucks ). 
i don't have a $$$ limit. 
so if you can please advice me on good graphic cards for this configuration, i would appreciate. 
thanks!
