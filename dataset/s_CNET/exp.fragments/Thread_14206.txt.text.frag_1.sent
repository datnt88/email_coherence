i'm having trouble setting up my home wired network and was wondering if anyone had experience this. 
i have the cable modem connected to the router (belkin n+) in the living room and there is a wall ethernet jack. 
i connected the router to the ethernet jack and that goes to my wire closet and is connected to a 5 port switch (linksys 10/100). the switch is then connected to 4 other ethernet lines that goes to other wall jacks in the house. the problem is that when i plug in a computer to the wall jack, it recognize that there's a signal but no internet or assigning of ip address. 
any help would be appreciated.
