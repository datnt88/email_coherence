ahh, yes that does limit the options as i feared. 
for starters, your best bet is to change out that modem. 
however, a significant consideration for this is the specific technical details of your adsl service. 
there are several different methodologies for adsl delivery and the modem has to be set exactly for what's coming up the line from the central office. 
you can often get a newer model that's appropriate from your service provider just by asking. 
so give them a call and see what they say. 
if they flat out refuse to work with you on it, let us know who they are so we can research the details of their transmission protocols and determine what alternate modems could work. 
(and we can also put out the word to the rest of the world not to do business with them... but, honestly, i'll be very surprised if they won't work with you on this.) otherwise, you going to have to leave the first pc in place to do the pppoe and make the conversion from usb. it would have to be running anytime you wanted another computer to access the internet - which is kinda stupid to have to put up with that. 
as you surmised, the wireless router would be next in the chain.
