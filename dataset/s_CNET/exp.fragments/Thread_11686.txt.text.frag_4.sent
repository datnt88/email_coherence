hey bob, thank you so much for the reply. 
i want to start off saying, i am not a proffesionel when it comes to all this bios and software orientated stuff, i just assembled the machine. 
i did however go to the bios and tried a few different ram settings (2133mhz, 1866mhz & 1600mhz) as i had read on other forums and such that some people talked about ram speed could have a say in the system. 
my bios 'looks' quite new, doesn't mean it is the newest, of course. 
i will however look into this new bios you speak of, do you know what difference the 'new' bios should have compared to the 'old' ? 
thank you in advance.
