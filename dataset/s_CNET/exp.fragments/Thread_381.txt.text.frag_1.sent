hi all i am wondering something. 
probably not, but what the heck. 
can i burn dvds on my cd-rom burner? 
here's the point to my question. 
a few days ago i was fooling around with my computer as i always do and got to wondering if i put a dvd+r in my cd burner if i could actually see the space on it. 
i can see the space on it but i haven't tried to burn anything yet. the burner that i have is a lite-on ltr-48327s, the media that i have is a jvc 4.7gb dvd+r. 
my os is windows xp home, and burning application is easy cd creator 5 platinum. 
any help you may be able to offer is greatly apreciated. 
thanks, sean.
