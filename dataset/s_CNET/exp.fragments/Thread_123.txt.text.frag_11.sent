you should take a moment and consider how you're going to make these drives line up so the cables can reach them. 
i usually do this: from the top of the case down: master c drive, cd rom, and second hard drive. 
a lot of cd roms like to be set as master, so i put the primary eide cable to the c: drive, then i put the end of the secondary eide cable to the cd rom and the middle connector to the second hard drive. 
if all are set to cable select, this will make the cd rom a secondary master and the new drive a secondary slave. 
i also try to calculate the location of the drives to leave as much space as possible between them for cooling purposes. 
i say, don't mess with the bios unless absolutely necessary. 
keep touching the case throughout the procedure to avoid a static electric spark that could kill everything. 
and unplug it.
