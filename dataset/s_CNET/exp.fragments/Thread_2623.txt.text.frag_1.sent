why this machine has no wizard troubleshooter is a mystery to me. 
i've set the faxing up 3 times, but whenver i try to send a fax it will ring the receiver until it &quot;times out&quot; and gives a progress report that says, &quot;no answer.&quot; when i go to the office supply store to send the fax, the &quot;no answer&quot; fax # works fine.
