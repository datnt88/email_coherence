checked this before going to work. 
turned on the computer, got one beep...now mouse has power. 
it's one of those mice that has the little glowing thing on the bottom. 
it now glows but still no power to keyboard or display on monitor. 
a quick look at the hp site, gives info on how to reset bios, of course you have to have power to keyboard. 
am going to see if there's an old one in the garage that i can try. the one i've got on this computer is far newer, so i suspect it wouldn't be recognized, but am going to give it a try come monday when i've time.
