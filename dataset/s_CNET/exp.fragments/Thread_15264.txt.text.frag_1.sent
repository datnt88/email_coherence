i just bought apple's time capsule, which is a combination hard drive and an airport base station wireless router. 
not surprisingly, the time capsule works perfectly with all my other apple computers, but so far my wife has not been apple to access the internet from her compaq desktop, with newly installed, netgear wireless-g pci adaptor. 
netgear's connection wizard recognizes the airport base station, and seemingly allows a connection, but then continues to scan, looking for other signals. 
we have yet to be able to use it to connect to the internet. 
does anyone know how i can overcome this problem? 
much thanks.
