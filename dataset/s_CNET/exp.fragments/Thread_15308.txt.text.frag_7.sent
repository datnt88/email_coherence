i was at best buy recently. 
i never shopped for mags. 
i had been interested in a viewsonic vx910 (19&quot;) i had seen at compusa. 
i thought it was a great looking monitor next to the rest of the samsungs, necs, etc. they have a 17&quot; version (vx710) which is very nice. 
i wanted digital capabilites which this series had. 
eventually i took a chance on a princeton and like it a lot. the viewsonic vxs are really nice too.
