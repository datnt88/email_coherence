i own 2 hp quad core machines. 
d4999t and d5000t. 
quad core was nice in its day but today i wonder if i would make the change you have discussed. 
i would if it was under 50 bucks and then move on. 
the problem is that beyond the cpu i bet i'd need a new hsf unit and maybe a bigger psu. 
and after all that, i wonder it it would be much faster. 
that is, i moved from one video transcoder to handbrake and found bigger speed gains than what i would expect from changing the cpu. 
why? 
because this transcoder uses all cores of the cpu where my old software was single core.
