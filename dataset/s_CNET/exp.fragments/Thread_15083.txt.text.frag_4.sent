take a moment and put these phrases into to learn about xp's recovery console and fixing boot issues. 
xp fixboot but i wonder about that lba change in the bios. 
if i do this, the drive that had data may become scrambled on the very next boot as the drive geometry has been altered. 
booting an os like nt, 2000, xp (most windows) will write to said drive and since the geometry changed, writes to such a drive may really scramble the contents. 
please excuse me as i ask why you would make this change?
