i am somewhat surprised at the claim that computers do not come with diagnostics, no pc i have ever bought did not have them, either with the machine of downloadable from the manufactures site. 
building diagnostic software is neither difficult nor expensive, especially since the cost is am amortized over thousands of items. 
you could also swap the monitor if you have an old one. 
ps in my other life, i amongst other things built diagnostic software.
