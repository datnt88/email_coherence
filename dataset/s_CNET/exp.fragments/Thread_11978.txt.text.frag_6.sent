well see pc specs does show up in firefox, but the layout is wrong. 
in firefox the view is diplayed like this . 
but this is how i meant it to look like this . 
and the links on the right is s'posed to scroll with the page. 
i don't know if it's just on my pc that the view is messed up in firefox like that. 
let me know what you see... and if there is a solution for this... thank you.
