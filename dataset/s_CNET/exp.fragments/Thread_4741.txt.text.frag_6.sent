also, now that you note that drive model, something does not jive with your claims such died in a few months. 
these models were available in the early 2003 timeframe. 
this is late 2004 so you may have had this unit for almost 18 months. 
given the prices we pay for cdrw drives you may have to pay out 20 to 40 bucks or less every 1 to 2 years.
