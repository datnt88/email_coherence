you had a cable modem in the brew as well. 
that's another path. the damage would have to be very evident such as parts blown off the board for them to say it was the protection device that failed to protect. 
sorry to hear about your loss, but seeing pc failures daily for a multitude of reasons i can only write that it's doubtful since the power supply is next in line for the line voltage to cause an issue and fail. 
not the motherboard.
