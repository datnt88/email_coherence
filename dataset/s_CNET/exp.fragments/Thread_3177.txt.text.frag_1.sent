hi, don`t know if i can ask this here but maybe someone can help me. 
i'f have a home sterio with nice 10&quot; speakers witch i connected to my pc for better sound with dvd's. 
problem is i can't come close to my screen, the magnets &quot;colorize&quot; my screen. 
i would like to know if anyone know how i can try to shield that speaker/box so i can get it closer to my screen? 
surely there must be some way to weeken the magnet's flied..or am i haeding to a deadend?? if someone can help, please let me know. 
thanks oops
