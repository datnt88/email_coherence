is anyone taking into concideration that there's not a lot of software out there to fully take advantage of the dual core's features and processing powers? 
it's new...let it sit for a while and let software catch up before you dish out some money due to hype and vibe. the way i see it a dual core system is a playstation2 when it first came out. 
and everyone's playing ps1 games on it thinking they're modern and in the loop. 
well imagine how much better when there are more ps2 games designed to run on the ps2. 
but hey that's just me
