i just bought a panasonic blu-ray player. 
i want to connect it to the internet. 
it does not provide a wireless internet connection. 
i must plug in a network cable. 
the problem is my computer is located in another room, and on another floor. 
i have a wireless router connected to computer now though. 
is there anything i can do to get my blu-ray player connected to the internet?
