i just labored over this decision myself. 
i had (still do) a bto system with an msi motherboard, 2.66 ghz processor & 1 gb ram, ati radeon 9700 pro video card...not a slouch by most people's standards but i had it built in 2000 and i'm a mega power user (database, graphics, huge files). 
i checked out upgrading so i could get a 3.8 ghz processor & 2 gb of ram (to start). 
changes in technology over the years rendered most of the parts i would have kept in compatible with the new motherboards capable of supporting the 3.8 processor... upgrade parts would have costed $1700 --- bought a new dell dimension xps on sale for $2300 and kept my 2.66 in tact (networked in as a backup system).
