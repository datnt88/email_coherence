does anyone know how to restore a file after emptying the recycle bin (not how to restore one that's currently in the bin)? 
i accidently deleted something and didn't realize my mistake until after i had emptied my recycle bin. 
i know that windows doesn't actually erase the data until something else needs the space (or something like that), so i stll have hope.
