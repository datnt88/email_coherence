hi all just got the netgear - rangemax dual-band wireless-n and set it up (no issues setting it up, in fact surprisingly easy)and it is set to dual band (2.4 & 5ghz). 
house has concrete walls (i know this can mess with the signal) question is. 
i get an excellent signal with the 2.4ghz wifi (in the room where i need the laptop working), but the 5ghz signal is not that great. 
any thoughts?
