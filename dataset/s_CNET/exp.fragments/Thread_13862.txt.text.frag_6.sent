as stated above, try diskcleanup. 
if this does not work and you really need to defrag might i suggest turning off sysstem restore, reboot, and then attempt to run defrag again. 
looking at your numbers, i see docs and settings at 43% but the numbers don't add up. 
for all of those ms worshipers out there, it won't hurt to turn disk restore off for a bit. 
it's a virus haven anyways.
