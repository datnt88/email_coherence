hello, i have a linksys wrt54gl v. 1.1 that has been dropping connection speed (starts at 54mb, then drops to 48mbs, 36mbs, 28mbs, down to 1mbs) then disconnects, then reconnects at 54 mbs. 
after a short while, it will drop the speed again until it disconnects and reconnects again. 
this is the third linksys wrt54gl that has done this. the first one was 5 years old before it started doing this in february, the second was 3 months old, and now the replacement linksys sent to me is doing this? 
does anyone know what is going on with my router? 
i am able to connect fine with the cat5 cable, but wireless seems to be the problem. 
even my phone(s) get disconnected from the wireless router. 
this problem just recently started and i don't know why, no settings had been changed on any of the routers until after the problem had already ocurred, then the linksys phone tech support had me make multiple changes.
