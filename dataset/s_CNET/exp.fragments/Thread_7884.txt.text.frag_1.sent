hi all, i'm building myself a new &quot;budget&quot; pc as the old p4 one is getting ancient now the components i selected are as follows: cpu : intel core 2 duo e7200 2,53ghz (1066mhz) 3mbl2 wolfdale lga775 - box vga : asus en8800gt/htdp/256mb or 8800gts (i'm still not sure but i'm probably getting the gt as its quite cheaper ) mb : gigabyte sc 775 ep45-ds3, intel p45 ram : dimm ddr2 2gb, 1066mhz, a-data, cl5-5-5-12 (kit 2x1gb) extreme edition hdd : wd caviar blue wd3200aaks 320gb, 16mb cache case : redstar happy16,400w,12cm fan questions: does this look like a nice &quot;ballanced&quot; pc build? 
is it ok to buy a case from redstar? is 400watt psu enough to supply all the power even if i buy the gts video card? 
note: i'll be running xp, i'll update to vista only when it's absolutely needed (i want to keep my xp as long as possible) thanks, j.m.
