computer dell 2400. 
i formatted the hard drive by using the reinstallation cd that came with the computer. 
i went to the bios and get it installed. the computer is running now. 
i installed ms office. 
but i think the eternet adapter is not activated. 
i am new doing this but i could not afford to pay to do it as i lost my job. 
i appreciate any help.
