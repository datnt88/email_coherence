here in most parts of the usa you can get pentium 4 machines for free on freecycle. 
in fact i like to freecycle old gear like this because it costs a lot to take them to the e-cycling centers. 
120 bucks one time for the dead rptv! 
so if you can find folk to take such off your hands, big savings.
