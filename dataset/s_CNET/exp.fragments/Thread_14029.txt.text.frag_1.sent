my hdd is frequently active even when &quot;nothing&quot; is running. 
because it is a mechanical device, i get nervous by too much activity. 
new gateway gt5012, pentium d, 2.8 ghz., 1 gb ram, 250 gb sata hdd. 
running windows media center xp, office pro xp installed. 
security provided by nsw premiere 2005 and zone alarm (yes, i wear a belt and suspenders!). in system tray: za, msn messenger, nsw a-v, loudspeaker, usb removal icon,and clock. 
in quick launch: control panel, windows explorer, word, cute ftp pro, front page, msn, internet explorer, media player, and a shortcut to a favorite web site. 
with all this stuff in place, the performance monitor shows about 310 mb of memory in use, and every 10 seconds or so, the graphs shows a spurt in activity. 
sometimes only a few percent of cpu time, but occasionally ten percent or higher. 
to see the effect, i stopped za, nsw, and set my cable modem to &quot;standby.&quot; no change in disk activity. 
what is causing this acitivity, and can i stop it or minimize it? 
this has bothered me for a long time, but the reason i have a new computer is that the hdd on my old one had to be replaced twice in two years. 
any help or insight will be greatly appreciated.
