franc, it's not neccisarily the memory that's bad. 
usually bad memory will cause a computer to lock up, or intermittant program errors, but rarely does a faulty module cause random rebooting. 
if you'd like to verify your memory, there's a free utility called memtest86+ (available from ). simply download and burn a prebuilt iso, and reboot your computer with the cd in the drive. the tests should start automatically (you may have to change the boot order in your bios). 
more likely, it's your powersupply that's lacking. 
over time, powersupplies can go bad - but i'm thinking more than likely you're putting too much of a load on it. 
what wattage is it rated for? 
modern computers can suck down a lot of juice, sometimes upwards of 400w. 
an insufficient power supply causes brownouts, which cause your reboots. the fact that this only occurs when the geforce is plugged in reinforces my theory - that 5200 takes a lot of power to run, and i'll wager it's the straw (or in this case, i-beam) that broke the camel's back. 
if it is the power supply, you'll need to purchase another one. 
good luck solving your problem! -jeff
