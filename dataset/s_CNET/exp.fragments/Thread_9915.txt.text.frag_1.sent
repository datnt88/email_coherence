i am looking for a server to back up all my computers and to store all the media files for my htpc. 
i also want it to run utorrent. 
i am not interested in building a nas server, i want a small server to fit on my already cluttered desk. 
my network knowledge is in between basic and novice. 
i'm looking for some suggestions for a network storage device for home use. 
thanks.
