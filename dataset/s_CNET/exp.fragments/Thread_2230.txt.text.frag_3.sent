1. &quot;when i exit the bios i get the same error&quot;. 
that seems ok with a new hard disk until you partition and format it and install an os on it. 
you don't tell anything about that. 
2. &quot;the cd won't run&quot;. 
what exactly does that mean? 
if you set the bios to boot from the cd first, and put a bootable windows xp cd in it (check on another pc that it is bootable, just to be sure), what happens? 
if bios set to boot from cd, the cd is bootable on another machine and doesn't boot here, first replace the cd-drive; if that doesn't help it's time to replace the motherboard.
