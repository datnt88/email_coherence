sorry for the delay getting back to you bob. as a matter of fact i have already done that with a pci card from siig with identical results. 
i already have another scanner, not a usb but on a parallel port (shared with another printer). 
it works fine on lpt1 (haven't tried it on the siig card (lpt2)). 
what i like about this scanner (and i suspect that any new scanner would be different) is that its a sheet feed, which scans a page in seconds and i am able to feed additional sheets in which is especially handy when i am sending a multi-page fax. the flatbed scanner takes several minutes per page and can only do one page at a time. 
a multi-page fax takes too long and must be saved as multiple winfax attachments to send as a fax.
