i take it that safety of your files is not a concern since it appears you are working on your only copy. 
this is where most lose it all. 
i offered a free tool to clone the drive so you can operate on the clone. 
with the the clone you can try and fail, make another clone until you fine tune your procedure. 
if you don't want to do this that's fine but you may want to think about places like if you don't want to work at recovery.
