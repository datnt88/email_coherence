if you are getting the bug for gaming, better to plan to build a new system. 
as mentioned ading a high power video card may require increasuing the power supply capability, and then going to the amd athlon cpu and on and on. 
then cooling problems arise within the small case. 
in this case the lower power consuming sempron is an asset, but for higher level gaming a detriment. 
gaming and video processing place the greatest demands on computers, thus low price and power are at odds, although there are now some fairly good gaming systems available for $800 or so.
