...when connecting with the ip address at the run command. 
the error message appears whenever i try to map a drive in explorer or when i try to map a drive or find the shares in workgroup in my network places. the error states that the network path could not be found, or perhaps i don't have permission to access that resource, and it urges me to contact my network administrator. 
well...that's me! 
great advice, microsoft!
