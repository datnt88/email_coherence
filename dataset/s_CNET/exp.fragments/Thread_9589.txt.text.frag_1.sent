i had a hard time with viruses. 
so i decided to format c: and reinstall xp.i am using two ide hards of 40 gig and 160 gig. 
i have xp's on both the drives but i am working with the xp on 40 hard disk. 
so i booted with an xp cd, although i was supposed to format only the partition c: unfortunately i had formatted the whole 40 gb. that way i lost all the data on my 40.(because there it didnt show me the separate partitions of disks) after installing the xp when i open the &quot;my computer&quot; i realised that the volumes on my 160 is not visible there. 
so i opened disk mgt in computer mgt wondering there i saw both the disks(40 and 160). 
but for the 160 it was visible only a one partition and there it shows, that partiton takes the whole capacity of the disk. 
but i had 3 partitions on my 160. 
my all the important data are on my 160. 
i suppose the data is still there since i didnt format that. 
so can anyone please help me to access the partitions on my 160. 
thanks in advance.
