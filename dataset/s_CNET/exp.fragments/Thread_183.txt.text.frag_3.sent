google away, because there are fans galore out there. 
use keywords, &quot;fan or pc cooling&quot;. 
understand also, that some pc setup have &quot;mutliple stage rpm&quot; that kicks-in to ahigher rpm in order to better cool. 
yours maybe doing that and of course is louder. 
don't discount that the replacement fan will do this as well. 
thus, if your new pc case has &quot;empty fan mountings&quot; to add a fan because keeping the case cool helps maintain the lower rpm level plus the overall cooling. 
understand 100% that most pc cases are &quot;in&quot; at the front. 
and &quot;out&quot; at the back and if so installed, &quot;out&quot; on side or top locations. 
you can improve cooling by making a hole and mounting fan. 
inspect and clean any frt. 
mount vent or filter. 
match the replacement fan to current one and sorry you pay more for better fans. 
also, larger is quieter but that may not work if where you plan to mount it is physically able to. the above are popular cooling websites, though check any you like via google.
