though i'm not sure that's exactly the case. 
in the system preferences, i can only choose one input source--the built in microphone, or the line in audio input. 
i've tried adjusting the input level for the line input in ams, but i don't notice any change, either. 
however, the amplifier part of it might be more what's going on. 
i suppose it doesn't exactly work like my pc's sound card line in, hehe, where it would supposedly amplify it. 
thanks for the help!
