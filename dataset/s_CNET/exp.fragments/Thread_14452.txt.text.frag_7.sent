thanks for your help, everyone. 
i suspect willy was right about the usb ports having been physically damaged by the power loss/surge. 
once i'd managed to get on line usb reappeared in device manager & system information (i don't know what i did to make this difference) but usb devices still wouldn't work. 
iv'e also just discovered that the floppy drive isn't recognising disks anymore. 
time for a new system, methinks!! oh well, this one was getting old anyway. the new one will include a ups!! thanks again, jeffk
