another question. 
with this mother board: biostar tforce6100-939 socket 939 nvidia geforce 6100 micro atx amd motherboard do i need a graphic card? 
i noticed it doesnt have an agp slot and i really want to use this graphic card: pny geforce 6800 gs / 256mb gddr3 / agp 8x i've decided on these products so far: amd athlon 64 3200+ venice 2000mhz ht socket 939 processor model ada3200bpbox - retail --$154.00 
pny geforce 6800 gs / 256mb gddr3 / agp 8x / dvi / vga / tv out / video card -- $179.99 i need a suggestion on a good quality board preferably around $50 - $80 that will work with these two components.
