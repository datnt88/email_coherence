hello, my husband just bought a gateway notebook computer for home and travel use. 
went into this without really knowing much about notebooks, but he really wanted one (happy early father's day to him :-)) anyway....where do we start about getting wireless internet? 
what do we need to buy? 
we have a one level house currently using dsl (roadrunner) for our 2 desktops. 
should we get wireless through roadrunner? 
someone mentioned said no...use wireless cards????? any information would be appreciated. 
thanks
