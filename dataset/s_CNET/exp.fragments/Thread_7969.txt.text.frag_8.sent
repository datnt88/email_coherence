turns out i had everything set up exactly correct. 
my problem was the &quot;&quot;technician&quot;&quot; i spoke with at my isp gave me the wrong dns server addresses! 
had it working 1 minute after calling them to re-check the numbers. 
thanks to everyone for all your help, i learned quite a few thing trying to figure this one out.
