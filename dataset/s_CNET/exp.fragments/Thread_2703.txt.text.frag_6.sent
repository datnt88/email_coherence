the manual is generic. 
should be a sticker around the bar code. 
but the most accurate info will be on the mobo itself. 
there will be a version sticker next to the chipset. 
i had a version 5. why limit yourself to duron. the board takes athlon, including thoroughbred. the version # will tell you how late a processor and ddr memory (usually up to pc2100). 
just checked elitegroup. the latest (k7s5a pro v.5 also takes xp athlon. 
good luck.
