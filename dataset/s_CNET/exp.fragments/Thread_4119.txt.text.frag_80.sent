i think it could be anything because you haven't mentioned required info about the problem so, i'll suggest a list of things u need to check 1) the slot which hoses the graphic card might have some problem get the slots checked 2) try rolling back the drivers to when they were originally working in good condition 3) check ur ram and the slots that hose the rams. 
occasionally rams get burnt out due to excess heating, try changing the slot memory module from a to b or vice versa 4) in the worst case ur graphics card capacitors might have been damaged, which is not a big issue . 
u can get it repaired, it's quite cheap too.
