i recently found that my computer would not start up correctly. 
i could get the hd to run, and everything running, except for the monitor. 
i tried 2 diffrent monitors, along with diffrent graphics cards. 
i shut off all power fully, and even unpluged everything. 
then randomly my father did the same thing i did with flipping the power switch on the powersuply and it started up. 
can anyone tell me what happend? 
should i be worried for the future. 
please respond, thankyou.
