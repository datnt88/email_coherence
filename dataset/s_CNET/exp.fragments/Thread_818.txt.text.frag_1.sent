purchased the samsung 244t recently and hooked it up two nights ago to my new rig. it was running fine for about 90 minutes and then all of a sudden the video became very distorted like the pixels were mass merging together. 
nothing was readable and the only thing viewable was color patterns. 
it was almost as if you had an old television and would smack the side of it if the picture started going crazy. 
i am trying to figure out though if it is a possible driver or overheat issue because its defective. 
i do know that it isn't the video card because i have different monitor hooked up and working fine. 
i am currently using an nvidia 8800 with dvi. 
i was reading somewhere though there might be a incompatibility issue between some 3rd party software that comes with the monitor and the video card but never seen it do what i am witnessing at the moment.
