does anyone know how to do this? 
i've got a p5g41t-m lx motherboard and have tried to enable wol through the bios, but can't find anything that looks like wol on the settings. 
any help would be hugely appreciated. 
incidentally, i've just been to asus' support site to try and get the answer to this question. 
i suspect having waded through endless webpages and been required to filling in fields upon fields of irrelevant and ridiculously technical information that they've outsourced management of their support to a direct competitor. 
it's a lesson in how to test the goodwill of even the most patient customer. 
(end of rant).
