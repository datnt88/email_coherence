ok if you really want what my dream system is, you gotta get the tyan thunder k8qs pro quad socket 940 motherboard. 
just the thought of running 4 cpus at once makes me drool. 
sure the motherboard alone is $1,500.00 but if u got the money, it would be amazing to have. 10 friggin ram slots, a total of 32gb of ram supported!! 4 amd opteron 800 processors. 
its expensive, and sure you wouldnt need it, but damn id love to see anyone top you with that. 
but in serious terms, you should go for a dual intel computer with a nvidia 6800gt graphics card, and as much ram as you can fit on there.
