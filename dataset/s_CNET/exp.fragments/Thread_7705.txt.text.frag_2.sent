when you get it, update the firmware, enable ssid and use wpa and it should &quot;just work.&quot; with your g and other systems. 
i'd keep that gigabit switch since the switch in these routers are not very good. 
i've seen them top out very quickly. 
my connection choice would be... internet -&gt; router -&gt; gigabit switch -&gt; wired pcs. 
i'd save those router ports when i overflowed the switch.
