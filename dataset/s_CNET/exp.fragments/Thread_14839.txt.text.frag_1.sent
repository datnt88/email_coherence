i have moved into a retirement village - private homes as well as aggregate ones - where there is very little communication amongst residents other than neighbor-to-neighbor and a weekly calendar put out by the central administration. 
i'm told that about 50% of the residents have email and some do get a blast from the admin in emergencies, or of course exchange email amongst themselves. 
i would like to instigate a move to get people using a localized &quot;bulletin board&quot; - facebook or google plus - and a calendar, probably the google one. 
not everyone can afford an ipad, but i'm sure many have kindles and the like and/or smartphones. 
my experience is with ipads/iphone. 
how good are the non-ipad tablets at doing internet stuff? 
can you recommend what list.cnet.remains 
s.cnet.train 
scripts should recommend to them? 
has anyone had experience implementing this in a community like this? i'd like advice!!
