pretty simple question, but i thought this would be a great bunch to ask. where is the cheapest place to buy a hundred feet or so of cat 5 cable. 
i need to do some routing through my house. it is for stuff that i can't do wirelessly. 
i know that the cable is pretty cheap, but i have a feeling that the local stores are going to try and gouge joe average consumer. 
thanks in advance.
