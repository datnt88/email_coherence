i took the respondants advise and bought the spinrite program. 
the problem is, i can't even get it to work. 
i had over 7,000 mp3 and family photo's on my hard drive and now i have nothing. 
i downloaded my entire music cd and personal family photos into my computer before moving from illinois to california, and now i have nothing. 
i must admit, i'm not the most computer savy guy out there, but i tried to use this program, followed what i thought were the instructions by hitting thr f2 or delete key during startup, and nothing happened. 
i guess i just wasted $80 of my hard earned money. if i could send this damn program back to spinrite i would. 
can anyone give me step by step instructions on what to do? 
i'm about at my wits end trying to get this consumer unfriendly program to work. 
thanks, terry
