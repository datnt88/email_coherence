this is not the problem...i have just swapped dvd burners, brand spankin' new, and i have the same problem. 
suggestions i have tried with no effect: 1) try difrent media 2) delete from control panels, reboot 3) delete upper and lower filters 4) uninstal nero 5) run nero cleanup 6) reinstal the version 6, not 7 nero 7) try another burner 8) uninstal (phisically) the dvd-rw and reinstall 9) flash burner 10) get new burner 11) get updated bios 12) reinstall windows still same lingering problem, i will also like to add get compleatly new system and do a fresh install to the list as well, as i have done that as well.
