get 1 stick of 1gb. it will be easier to upgrade later. 
the difference in price is negligible. 
i have done many upgrades and i have to say the best upgrades i ever did was to get a better monitor and speakers. 
if you are using anything less than 19inches or cheap speakers you will definitly enjoy improving those first. 
i know it sounds stupid, but these are investments that are worth it becuase they dont get outdated. 
my next upgrade is going to be a new desk so that i can type easier. 
sometimes whats around the box is more important than whats in it.
