do you have any idea what a network is? 
how can you have wireless internet (a network) without having a network? 
if you would read your instructions... you connect your computer {via ethernet} to the router to perform the setup. 
then you disconnect the computer (laptop) and connect the router to your modem. 
enable your wireless adapter on your laptop, and you are good to go. 
note: if it still doesn't work correctly, try a complete power cycle. 
1)power off computer, power off router, power off modem. 
---leave off for at least 30 sec.--- 2) power on modem, power on router, power on computer. 
just so you know: that is a network.
