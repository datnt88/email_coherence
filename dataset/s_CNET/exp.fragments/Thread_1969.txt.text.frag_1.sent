i am using trendnet wireless router tew-631brp and trendnet pc card tew-621pc on a brand new laptop running windows xp. i turned on wpa2-psk and am running zonealarm security suite. 
after reading the forum posts i have checked for firmware upgrades and driver upgrades. 
the problem i am having is the connection holds for a few minutes and then drops completely. 
it forces me to find the network and sign in again with a password- only to be dropped 5 minutes later again. 
if anyone can help would be appreciated!
