i would really be willing to pay the current ipad prices for a 7&quot; version if they keep the hardware as is and don't remove the 4g capability. 
...sure, a lower price would be nice, but i just want a 7&quot; version. 
i was playing with a smaller samsung tablet at the at&t store, and have also played with the playbook at work, and think the smaller size is perfect.
