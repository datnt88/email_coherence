for me it's a no sale because of folk that complain in these forums about random reboots and that setup is listed too often. the 160gb drive looks small today and well, as to the virus scan why is that needed as we can slip in the os dvd, reload and then all the drivers to be sure it doesn't have a rootkit or worse?
