if you actually change it you will drop. 
some commercial ap have the ability to add multiple ssid to the same vlan. 
you could then run in parallel for a while and tell your uses to use the new one and then remove the old. 
a couple of brands of ap actually have a feature that allows you to not allow new sessions to a ssid but leave it active.
