i currently have a linksys wrt54g that has 4 ethernet ports and of course wireless capability. 
right now, i have 3 computers and 1 printer hooked up via ethernet cable to the router. 
my laptop uses the wireless capability. 
so all ports are used. 
i am buying an external hardrive to be shared by all the computers and it will be hooked up to the router via ethernet so i am going to be short 1 port on the router. 
do i need a router with extra ports, or can i somehow combine the new external hard drive's ethernet cable with one of the existing computer's so they share a router port? 
if i need a new router with extra ports, can you kindly recommend one for me? 
all i've come across are 4 port routers. 
thanks
