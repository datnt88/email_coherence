i recently purchased an ati video card strictly because of the tv out feature (i play online poker and it would be very nice to be able to play in my recliner) the card i bought with tv out is a pci card. the video card that came with my computer is built in to my motherboard. 
whenever i try and boot up with my new card, the computer will freeze shortly after it boots. 
i have disabled and uninstalled the first video card with the device manager but it continues to freeze. 
i believe that it is a conflict with the 2 cards but how do i get the computer to just forget about my first card since i cant take it out..... any help would be much appreciated.... thank you!
