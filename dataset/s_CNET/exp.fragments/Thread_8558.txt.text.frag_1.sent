i have a compaq presario desktop that won't start-up. 
when you push the power button the lights come on and the monitor stays in the sleep mode. 
i was told that the motherboard or processor were bad. 
so, i purchased a new abit va-10 motherboard and athlon xp processor. 
i installed both items, and the computer still has the same problem. 
please help!! what else could be wrong with the computer?
