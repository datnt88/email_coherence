well, the reason i said moving them around, is because with our current set up we have 2 switches, a cisco switch and a 3com switch, the cisco being the main one. 
the 3com switch is connected through a port on the cisco switch. 
users are having problems on both switches, but users on the 3com could be having problems because there is something wrong with the cisco then it will cause problems for the 3com. 
i would remove the cisco entirely to do some testing, but it is configured by our voip people to allow for voip and some other network settings that i dont understand. 
i believe that they can monitor the switch though so i might find out if they have been seeing any drops on ports in the last few days.
