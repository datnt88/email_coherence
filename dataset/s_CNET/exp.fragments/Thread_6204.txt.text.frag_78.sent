file sharing and configuration control with subversion (svn) is my answer. 
svn is a popular and very well implemented, opensource (did i say free?) configuration control system: ( ) that runs on most platforms. 
the svn repository must be hosted somewhere which entails a bit of work, but there are cloud-based free or inexpensive svn services out there like beanstalk ( ). each workstation needs a client application to checkin and checkout files. 
i use and suggest opensource tortoisesvn ( ) which integrates smoothly with windows. 
there is some learning involved, but the benefits are vast. 
enjoy!
