maybe the drivers for the devices are having a problem with the games. the hardware appears to be adequate. 
first one to try is the graphics. 
go to the nvidia site and let the autocheck look at the video driver. 
since no mention of which os, check on the motherboard drivers at the asus site for drivers matching the os installed. 
if none of that helps, check on user forums for the games you play to see if others are having problems with the hardware you have in place.
