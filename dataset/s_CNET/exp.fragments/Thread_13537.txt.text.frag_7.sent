i'm a fairly active amateur potographer, and lover of old-style contemporary jazz, and wanted a means of storing both photos and music files off of my hard-drive and have immediate access to the data, plus a a fairly easy means of accomplishing backups. 
following what i considered extensive research on the avilable means of storing backups i settled on the hp media vault mv-210. 
it is connected through my verizon fios router, provides scheduled backups of my documents, photos, and music files. the nv-2120 comes with one 500gb hard drive with the ability to double that capacity with the addition of a second 500gb hard drive. 
i've had the device for approximately six months, have approximately 250gb of data (both music and phptos) stored on it, and have become quite comfortable with its features. 
it just sits on the corner of my work area and automatically takes care of backups. 
then it tells me when it is performing a backup and then goes back to sleep. 
occasionally, just for peace of mind, i check the stored data by actually listening to music stored on the drive or viewing and edditing pictures that are out there. 
i hope that helps.
