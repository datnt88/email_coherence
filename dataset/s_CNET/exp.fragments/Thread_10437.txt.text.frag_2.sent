there is. 
buy a ssd (60 gb at least) and install the os on it from the windows disk, the drivers from the driver disk(s) and the application from their setup. 
then add the original drive again, delete the windows folder and the folders from program files you don't need any more. 
that leaves the data. 
then move your new documents folders from the ssd to the hard disk. 
done.
