i have been using a toshiba satellite laptop with intel wifi4965agn with no problems. 
it suddenly no longer sees my router's ssid. the recent changes have been the purchase of an iphone4 2 days prior to the problem. 
my wife has had the same phone for nearly a year without problems. the only other thing might be software updates, which were adobe reader, mcaffee antivirus and itunes. the most recent was adobe. 
before it stopped recognizing my ssid, it would drop the connection and connect itself again. 
it sees all the other ssids in the neighbourhood but not the one in the house! 
very odd. 
i tried running connectivity doctor. 
it told me there was a problem the log says media state disconnected. 
furthermore, our iphones are working perfectly. 
i'.m using a buffalo wzr2 g300n but everything is in japanese. 
i am able to set it up, just can't tweak it as the instructions for the english models are quite different. 
any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.
