going to a data recovery firm is a little late, once you have tried to recover and reformatted/partitioned it is extremely unlikely you can get anything back. 
i have clients that have paid ontrack and others to get their data back, and it has been successful, but it has cost $1500-$120000, and getting back data from a raid array is in the higher priced range because of the complexity involved. 
in your case you posted your questions for help too late.
