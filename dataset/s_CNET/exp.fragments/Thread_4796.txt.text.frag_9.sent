hi ddoom, can we back-track a bit, get some more info? 
when you say re-install, what exactly do you mean? 
if you booted from the xp cd did you choose repair or a fresh install? 
you say you can only boot into dos mode - is this using a boot disc or the xp disc? 
it is most unlikely that two cd readers should fail at the same time, and running fdisk from dos will check your hd out before a re-install if all else fails.
