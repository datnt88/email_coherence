i'm sure glad i asked! 
i'm thinking i might be better off just upgrading to a 64-bit os, instead. 
i have my graphics on the 500gb sata4 and keep the 320gb sata0 for programs and documents. 
my email and entertainment is on my old ddr system. 
still, i find that saving png files on the new ddr2 system takes minutes if they are large posters. 
thanks for your help!
