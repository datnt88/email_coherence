since your machines are not in some dns (server) pathping can't resolve the names. 
no failure in my book. 
-&gt; the network neighborhood is full of issues. 
no fix is forthcoming and if you want to spend the money on the phone with support, so be it. 
however if i want to look at shares and machines i use the command line. 
such as... net view and the other net commands. 
feel free to rant that the network neighborhood needs work.
