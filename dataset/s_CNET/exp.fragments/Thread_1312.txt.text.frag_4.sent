i can't get to safe mode at all. 
i get no video. 
i can hear the hd doing its thing, going thru post etc. i dont get the beeps associated with no video card. 
but i have taken the card out and run with nothing, i get the beeps then. 
additionally, i changed the jumper to reset the cmos and booted that way with no results. 
i have tried booting to a bootable floppy, but still no video, although you can tell it reads the disk goes thru the commands and waits at the command prompt. 
thanks for your help.
