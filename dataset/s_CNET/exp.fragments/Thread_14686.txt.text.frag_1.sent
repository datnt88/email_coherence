i have recently acquired a samsung momitor 933sn which is currently working but appears to be using the nokia drivers which were previously installed, although i carried out the installation using the samsung disc. 
i can adjust the screen size and display by rght-clicking on the desktop,then selecting properties and settings - but these are the normal windows instructions and are not unique to the samsung monitor. 
if i use the procedure - control panel&lt;administrative tools&lt;device manager&lt;monitors&lt;plug & play monitor&lt;properties - the message reveals nokia geforce4 mx 420, which was my previous monitor. 
i also have driver update program and this fails to detect the samsung monitor and insists that i update the nokia drivers. 
do you have any advice? 
does it matter that the samsung monitor and drivers are not detected on my computer? 
or, is it a case of &quot;if it works don,t fixi it&quot;?
