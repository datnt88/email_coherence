but looking over your post i can't tell if there are other issues with the hardware. 
you set the direction of the discussion so let me note that memory failures can be caused by overtaxed power supplies, over heating components (just last week found 2 loose heatsinks) and the bad caps issue. 
then we have that age old issue of setting the bios for the ram in question. 
today i find many owners glaze over we we need to discuss exact part numbers, bios versions and more.
