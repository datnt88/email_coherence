look for a quality of service setting in the router's program, it's possible the wireless has been throttled down there. 
i had the exact opposite problem in which my two oldest using wireless would almost steal the entire bandwith, even though i was hardwired to the modem. 
to slow them down and give me back bandwidth i disabled the wmm support and gave me high priority and them both low priority settings. 
bandwidth control can also be enabled in such section. 
since you seem interested in faster wifi, just do the opposite.
