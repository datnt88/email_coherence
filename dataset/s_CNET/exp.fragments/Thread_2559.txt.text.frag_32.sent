i think that, from your question, a mac mini would be great for you. 
a mac mini comes with ilife, which contains video editing and dvd creation tools, as well as itunes, which you may already be familier with. 
as a bonus, it is small and quiet your printer should work, check with the manufacturer. 
if your monitor has digital inputs, make sure you have a dvi cable. 
you can buy one from the apple store. 
i would recomend the core duo version with 1gib of ram and the 100gib hard disk. 
if you do go for core solo, make sure to select the super drive, or you won't be able to burn disks.
