thanks for the input regarding open office and msoffice 07. i am leaning towards getting an external drive. 
does it matter what brand external dvd drive or are they all basically the same? 
best buy is offering the asus netbook at a good price,though the external dvd drive is $89. but they also recommend getting their initial 'tune-up'which enhances performance, removes things, etc., for $49 is this tune-up a worthwhile thing to do/invest in for best functioning? 
thanks again for any feedback.
