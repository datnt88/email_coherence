im currently in the process of purchasing some ram for my 3.2ghz p4 system. 
it has 800mhz fsb, 4 available ram slots- 2 of which are standard ddr and the other 2 slots are ddr2 compliant.(mobo is gigabyte 8i915p duo pro) i have been looking at 1 gb pairs (2 x 512mb) pc3200 ddr400 and pc4200 ddr2-533 these are the fastest speeds i think my motherboard can handle, the problem is which speed is most suitable. 
i dont plan to overclock the system, so will running pc3200 in dual channel mean i get the full fsb? also is the ddr2-533 ram not neccessary as it exceeds the 800fsb? 
i am a little confused at the matter of fsb, multipliers etc so any help here would be great, thanks.
