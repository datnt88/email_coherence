i have a linksys wireless router set up (wrt54g) and my pc desktop and laptop connect fine to the internet with wire and wireless. 
i installed an airport card in our power mac g4 but this cannot detect my wireless network. 
i have it connected now with an ethernet cable running through the kitchen but want to get rid of the cable. 
is there a compatibility issue with airport and a linksys wireless network? the mac recognizes the airport card so i hope that means that it is good. 
(i got it from ebay used) this mac is the farthest away from the router so i guess my next try is to see if i can move the router a little bit closer. 
i am a newbie to wireless so possibly i have a setting wrong. 
i did tell the router the mac addresses of all of the computers that i want to connect. 
any advice? 
thanks, karen
