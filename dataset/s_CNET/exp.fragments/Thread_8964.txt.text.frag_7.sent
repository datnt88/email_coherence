if you can try to go for an nvidia geforce 9600gt graphics card with 512mb vram. 
make sure that the smps or psu (the power supply)is 500w or better. 
try to get a dvd writer, its helpful in data backup. 
if you're going to watch movies you can add a blu ray player at a later date when blu ray discs become mainstream. 
go for a decent 19&quot; lcd monitor or better
