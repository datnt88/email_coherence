i'll try the best i can without visiting your site. 
if i was there i might look at my pad with a nice app that shows me nearby routers and systems in a way that shows me what channels are open. 
i can't be right since i don't have the luxury of being there. 
but i will try anyway. 
as it stands it's something and if i believe your pc is fine then i have to go with what i encounter elsewhere. 
-&gt; there is a test that i use when i think others are interfering with the wifi network and it's very simple. 
we get wired and turn off the wifi in the router. 
this removes wifi from the picture.
