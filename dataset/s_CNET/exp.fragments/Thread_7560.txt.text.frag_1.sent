just bought one at bestbuy the other day and the ram makes a lot of noise, since i set it up. the specs in the pc are: amd athlon 64 porcessor 3500plus. 
512 mb with 200 gb. it is a amd athlon 64. i asked the best buy staff if this is a better pc than the ones they had out. 
he stated it is better, and far greater capcaity for memory. 
my last pc was an emachine with a celeron processor , and i do not like the celerons. 
i wanted something smoother, quicker and more effective. is it normal for the tower to make so much noise being it's a new pc ? is it normal for the pages to load much slower as well? 
i been told this is a hp compaq preserio and that there pretty good, but unusre if this is even the case. 
should i bring this pc back ? 
any other suggestions on what other pc to buy under $699 price tag? 
this pc was under $500. 
thanks
