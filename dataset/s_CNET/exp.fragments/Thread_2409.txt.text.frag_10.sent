your responses to the replies i will simply suggest that you can sit down with the discs and a good sector editor and recover what you can sector by sector. 
(you have mentioned limited funds so professional recovery is out and raid 0 recovery is expensive!) here are a couple and you can use this link to find others: breakpoint software offers the hex workshop at x-ways software offers several forensic tools including winhex at &quot;roadkils&quot; offers another here another would be diskedit (find it here ) and this site will help with your editing project for getting back up and running the advice to skip the raid and start with a single good ide drive to keep things simple is something you should really consider. the alternative is to take your problem to a professional and pay for the fix. 
good luck.
