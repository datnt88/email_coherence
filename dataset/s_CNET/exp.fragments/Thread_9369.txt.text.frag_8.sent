i have the same problem, but all of my power connections are secure. 
can you recall any of the help creative gave you on the problem? 
i have updated everything, and am running on the xp pro sp2 with an asus a7n8x. 
i can't think of anything else, and i am sick of waiting for creative to respond to my tech support request. 
i use more features on the external hub than anything else, and would greatly appreciate any help anyon can give me.... the only thing i havent checked is continuity on the firewire part of the cable to the external hub, as i don't have a cable tester for firewire cables, and my probes on my multimeter are too large to fit in the slot on the end of the cable. 
thanks for any help you can give me
