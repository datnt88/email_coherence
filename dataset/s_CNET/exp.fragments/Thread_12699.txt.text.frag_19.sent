done the 10.3 reinstall (using the matshita internal cdrw) but no change - the toast icon still doesn't open when double-clicked on the cd or if copied onto my system !! it showed as an application icon (folder with 'a' motif) when i tried to open it but has since reverted back to the toaster icon after another attempt to open. 
dodgy cd ? 
there is no command requesting me to register/input key code, etc. really don't know what's going on here. 
i bought this new disk from a guy in the usa (power seller) on ebay and i've written to him about it. 
it all started with the lacie d2.....
