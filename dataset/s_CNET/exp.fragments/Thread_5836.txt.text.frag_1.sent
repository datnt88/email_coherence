many times i come across people that would like to add networked backup to their home network but don't want to buy a new router with a usb port. 
if there are no desktop computers in the home, they won't want to tether a drive to one laptop only for the drive to not be available to others should that laptop be moved. is there an adapter that will allow an external usb hard drive to connect to an ethernet port on a router that can then be shared?
