this is probably a stupid question but why does windows hardwar information show incorrect information about my hardware, this has happened to me on every pc i have owned, on my current pc, i have 512mb of ram installed, windows says i have 384mb and i have a 2.4ghz processor, and windows shows that i have a 1.81ghz, (when i upgraded to x64 it showed that i ran at 2.2ghz) why does windows do this? 
does this happen to everybody?
