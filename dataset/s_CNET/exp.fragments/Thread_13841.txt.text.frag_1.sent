currently, i have a computer connected to the internet via a outlet modem jack (that sends a signal to an outlet in another room that is connected to the phone line). 
i want to hook this computer up to broadband (cable) without running any wires to the computer. 
(the computer, by the way, is on the other side of the room from the cable wire.) can i have the cable connection to the computer without any wires from the cable wire in the wall to the computer? 
and if so, how and what equipment do i need? 
thanks.
