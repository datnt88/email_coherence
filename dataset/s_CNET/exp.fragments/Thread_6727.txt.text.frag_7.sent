i'm pretty good at using autocad, but not sure about the equipment requirements. 
since autocad is a vector line program... is a more powerful graphics card essential for its smooth running on a mac book booting to windows? 
if it was a raster based image i would say you need the beefier video support the mbpro offers, but since it is a vector based image the program displays then is the processor power more important? 
i will have to look this up. 
along these lines... has anyone here got an opinion about mac-cad ? 
cheers grim
