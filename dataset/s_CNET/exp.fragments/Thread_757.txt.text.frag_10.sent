if you know how to build computers you need to check the prices sometimes its cheaper buy a brand name , the best is dell for just cases and mb that it uses also some of the deals they have especially this month they are giving alot away like free printer and 17&quot; or 19&quot; lcd, the other companies are a pain to add hardware like harddrives, because you don't know whose motherboard is used plus the cases are small and pain to take apart. 
you need to get the parts cheap to match brand name since you get os for nothing.
