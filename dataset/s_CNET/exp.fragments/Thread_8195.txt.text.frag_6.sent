i've dropped hints that there issues around usb, but without knowing the make and model of your machine, i can't tell if requires an usb filter driver, sp1 from microsoft or any trick as noted by usbman.

i'd love to see you succeed, but such information can be vital to find out if the os is installed completely since microsoft doesn't do it for you. 
here's an example tricks about usb on via based boards. 
i'd supply yours, but you haven't revealed the make/model/chipset.
