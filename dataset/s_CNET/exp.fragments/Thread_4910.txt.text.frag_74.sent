well, there has been another bios update since that you could have tried, that gateway says does address the reboot issues. 
have you done the 9539095.exe 
update? 
personally, i would try this since it's out and mentioned as a reboot solution along with the following: check for trend micro anti-virus and web spysweeper installed. 
if so, remove web spysweeper and then refer to the software supplier for support and resolution. 
would love to hear back from others that had the problems and tried this solution.
