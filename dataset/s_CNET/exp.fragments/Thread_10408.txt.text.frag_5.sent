in my mind i thought it could be sort of possible to use something like this but instead of splitting the cat5 cable, it would be connected the hdmi transmitter to transmit the location to two places, that device wont work, but if there was something that was capable of sending a cat5 signal to two locations would have been nice, i thought of a hub or switch, but read that the hdmi to cat5 devices aren't able to go through that.
