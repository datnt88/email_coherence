about two weeks ago my pc stopped turning on. 
i had no problems prior to this. 
i had it looked at by local pc guy and he said power supply was fine, that it was the motherboard or cpu. 
also, said it would be $250.00 to fix. 
i wanted to see if this sounded right, or was i getting screwed. 
thanks for any help. 
emachine, about a year old, running winxp home ed.
