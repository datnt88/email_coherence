i bought it at the same time as the video card, which was at the start of december 2012. 
so about a month and a half. 
haven't really used the computer much, and just now actually trying to set it up. 
i just ran out to every computer/office store that i know of, and nobody had any of the 6/6+2 pin connectors. 
i'll have to order one online and come back to this thread later, when it arrives.
