i have a 2003 small business server. 
just last week i had 37g total, 19g free. 
a few days ago, i had 403 m free. 
when i check the disk usage total it shows the builtin/administrators account using 35g, but i can't figure out what processes could be using it. the shadow copy service had been running, and that was using 3g, once i disabled it i got it back, but the next day my storage was used up again. 
any ideas?
