there's a place i visit often in new hampshire called federal jack's. 
(a brew pub / restaurant - which explains why i visit often.) they have customer wireless that's actually pretty good. 
but they're smart enough to not have a fixed password. 
when you show up, the hostess will give you a unique wifi key on a printed slip that's good for a couple of hours. 
when you sign into their web-auth, the key will give you access, but clearly expires after the normal guest access window. 
i don't know which system they're using, but it struck me as the most serviceable option i've seen in public use. 
it's certainly not something they're administering manually - something has to be generating the keys en-masse and setting the expirations.
