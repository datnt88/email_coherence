normally this is just a question of plugging it in an moving on. 
when you say that the macbook recognizes it, what do you mean? 
does the mb have an ip address that starts with 192 or 169? 
(169 is not good) after not being able to load a page, does safari display the network diagnostics button? 
if so, what happens when you proceed with the diagnostics?
