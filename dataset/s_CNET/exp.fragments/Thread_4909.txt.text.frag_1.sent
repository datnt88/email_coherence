several teachers in our school are trying to connect their computers to video projectors. 
we want to use a y-splitter so we don't have to always change cables. 
when we connect the splitter on many of the monitors (several different brands) the monitor becomes fuzzy. 
the picture on the projector is fine. 
if we disconnect the splitter and connect the monitor cable directly to the pc the picture quality is fine. 
my question is does this have to do with the quality of splitter we are using and how do i find one the will work with out making the monitor appear fuzzy? 
any help is greatly appreciated. 
thank you, sister elizabeth powhatan school
