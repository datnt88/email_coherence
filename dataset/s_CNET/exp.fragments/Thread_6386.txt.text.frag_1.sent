i have win98se.my 
computer stopped recpgnising my usb scanner.the 
scanner is a tiny that came with the computer.i 
have checked all the connections several times and unloaded and reloaded the software several times.i 
have switched usb ports to check for a good connection to no avail.all 
i can get is a message saying to check my connections and make sure the usb port is active because it cannot find the device. 
i have done all i know to do, any suggestions.i have not changed anything on the computer with the exception of going from dialup to dsl.
