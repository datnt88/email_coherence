thankyou for the suggestions drobo does sound really great and simple actually, and reliability is the biggest concern for me. is there anything stopping me just getting say a 320gb internal hdd now, then buying a drobo a bit later on and another hdd and transferring the first one to the drobo (when i have the $, and when prices down a bit)? 
i am in nz and am having trouble even finding a nz price/seller for drobo, and not sure whether it would be any cheaper to order things from us after shipping and tax included. 
also, if did do as i mentioned above (say use one hdd for a few months) would the kind of setup we are talking about be at much risk of overheating problems if in a regular sized box (mid-tower?)? would moving to the drobo setup eliminate a lot of heating issues? 
thankyou again for your help, it is greatly appreciated!
