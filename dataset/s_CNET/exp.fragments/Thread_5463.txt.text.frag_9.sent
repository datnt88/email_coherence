ok, thanks! 
i'm going to wait til this sundays adds to see if there are any good priced e6750's that have the same stuff as the athlon gateway, if it does then that's the one i'll get since there so much better than the athlons. 
i'm also going to ask the sells person how much of this computers is upgradable, because i don't want to get stuck with whats there. 
as for the monitors, $220 for a 22&quot; is an amazing deal for the prices i've been seeing, thanks! 
and thanks again for all your help! 
i'll post what i end up getting whenever i buy one!
