that hard drive does not sound healthy. 
if the a & i option was there first, but has since disappeared, it is a reasonable sign that the drive is defective. the flashing question mark means that the system cannot find a viable system folder from which to boot the machine. 
the &quot;restore&quot; function in disk utility does not do what it sounds like it would do. 
it is for restoring a disk from a disk image, which you do not have, and will do nothing for you. 
you would be well advised to leave the disk alone and contact a data recovery service. 
they are not cheap. 
only you can make the determination as to whether your data is worth the price that they charge. 
google for &quot;data recovery&quot; and you will find lots of hits. 
you don't have to specify mac or windows, they do any platform. 
sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but when a drive appears and disappears, it is not a good sign.
