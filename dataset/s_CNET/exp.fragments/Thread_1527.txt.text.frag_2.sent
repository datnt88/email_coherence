windows will tend to adjust the size of the swap file using it's own formula...which does not make much sense to me. 
i believe it makes the file 1 1/2 times larger than physical ram. it would seem that more physical ram should reduce the size needed for virtual memory use. 
maybe someone here knows why this happens.
