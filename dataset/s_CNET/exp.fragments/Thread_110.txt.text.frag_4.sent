let me reveal i am authoring windows mobile 5 and up applications. 
it is not windows vista or even close to it. 
it's &quot;windows&quot; in name and does not run any of your common desktop windows applications. 
-&gt; i'd love to get you an answer but your question is still too big to answer in this small space. 
can you ask the one thing you need to know?
