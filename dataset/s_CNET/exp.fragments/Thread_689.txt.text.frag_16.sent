we allready had a epson cx6000 and located a source for alternative cartridges. 
we found that the cx6000 cartridges also worked in the cx9400. 
they are often out of stock but they can be found at a much more reasonable cost than epson cartridges. 
you have to make certain that the cx6000 cartridges are for the version after may 0f 2007, when epson decided to change it's technology in an attempt to prevent the use of affordable cartridges.
