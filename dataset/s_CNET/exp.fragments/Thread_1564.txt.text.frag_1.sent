i bought a maxtor 250gb sata-150 as a second drive for video editing. 
my system currently has a 160gb pata-100 hard drive. 
my motherboard is a ms-7093. the instructions say i need to make sure the sata port is enabled. 
i was in the bios and saw nothing about sata. 
integrated periferals says a lot about ide. 
any ideas on how i can enable my sata port.
