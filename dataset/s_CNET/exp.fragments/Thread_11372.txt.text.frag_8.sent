the only item that looked odd was the two connection on the server. 
since what a router is, what a hub is and what each does is on the internet i don't duplicate that here. 
at the top of this forum is a sticky note about how to use more than one router. 
as to multiple hubs, that's been done for years with little more than plug in the cables.
