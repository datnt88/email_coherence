hi, since i've had this (3 weeks, 2nd hand), it has only read pre-burned cd's and any blank media inserted will not show on the desktop or in disk utility and burning is therefore not enabled. the lite-on cdrw shows up in left window of disk utility. 
when i insert the lacie toast cd, it never shows anywhere - the device makes no sound, flashing light stops and it just sits there, doing nothing ! 
system profiler shows nothing - just the i-mac's matshita slot-load internal cdrw. 
toast cannot be found anywhere on my system, simply because it's never been able to download from this lacie toast cd from the start. 
last night i tried that cd in the matshita internal but it just 'whirred' and wouldn't open, then ejected it on each attempt(that's part of the original problem that led to me buying an external). 
i don't have a 6 pin to 6 pin firewire cable (this cdrw needs that) and didn't get one in case that solved nothing. 
i'm checking the cdrw on a friend's pc today (unfortunately not a mac) to make sure it's working fully and i'll post the result here. 
all i have at the moment is read-only capabilities. 
thanks for your advice - any further thoughts would be very appreciated.
