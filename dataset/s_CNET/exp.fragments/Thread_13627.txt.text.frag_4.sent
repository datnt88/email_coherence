selecting the basics (motherboard, cpu,) is almost child's play at this point; as long as you ascertain the same socket for both, you can't go wrong - the same can't be said for the rest of your build, as it becomes more personal (and what your budget will allow for). 
after reviewing your choices, i'd like to offer some alternatives (with reasoning provided): pc case: your choice - thermaltake level 10 gt black my choice: nzxt switch 810 why: it will contain all that you selected; with the added bonuses of having an sd card slot reader already installed, the allowance for up to 3 radiators (if you choose to water cool the pc), optional fan mounting (either 120 or 140mm), hdd cage removal, etc it's almost $100 less than the level 10 (not including the sd card reader -$19) monitor: your choice - samsung b2240ew 22&quot; widescreen lcd monitor ($379) my choice: asus ve278q 27in widescreen lcd monitor why: 5&quot; bigger, 2ms response (for gaming), hdmi, display port, dvi, and $60 cheaper antivirus: your choice - panda global protection 2010 bilingual oem w/ 1 year subscription ($30) my choice: microsoft security essentials why: will do pretty much everything that the paid versions will...free
