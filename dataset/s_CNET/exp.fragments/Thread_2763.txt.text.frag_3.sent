that can work for my laptop but i don't think i will have a problem with configuring the laptop & printer to work wirelessly. the problem will be being able to print from the desktop to the wireless printer setup in another room. 
someone suggested getting a wireless usb adapter in order to make my desktop wireless so that it can print to the printer. 
do you know if that will work? 
i am new to this wireless stuff - but it would seem to me that if my laptop & my printer are wireless and are both configured to pick up the signal from the router, then they can interact, but if the desktop is not wireless then it has no way to send a signal to the printer - so the usb adapter sounds like it makes sense, but i am unsure. 
any thoughts, anyone?
