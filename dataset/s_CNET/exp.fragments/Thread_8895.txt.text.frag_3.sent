at one point, a microsoft driver was updated and toshiba support said that was the cause (6 months ago). 
they had me reset to factory (f11 i think) and this seemed to work. 
two weeks ago, lost access. 
after setting back to previous time (two weeks earlier when repair shop set to factory for virus removal), no microsoft driver, just realtek but still was having problems. 
reset driver, reloaded disc for linksys on laptop, etc but no luck. 
took laptop out of house to test remote places to determine if router or not and this worked. 
then set up router through my desktop, kept unsecured and laptop connects without issue (so far). 
i have not tried to add security through desktop but that was goint to be my next step but when i tried to connect to secure connection with correct password at remote location, computer would not connect. 
hope this is enough info. 
thanks for trying.
