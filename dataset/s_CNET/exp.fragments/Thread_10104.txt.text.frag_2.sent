you need to know what expansion slots the motherboard has available for inserting a video card. 
(click on motherboard specifications) you have 3 pci slots, one agp8x slot, and no pci express slots. 
your best option is to get an agp 8x video card. 
make sure your psu can handle the video card you intend to purchase. 
if it doesn't, you will have to upgrade the psu.
