im going to need a pc that will run a few apps and probably a couple of games that dont require high-end graphics. 
i looked around and came up with these specifications: intel core 2 duo [2.6 ghz] ddr2 ram [2 gb] hard disk (sata) [250 gb] graphics card [256 mb] now, i'd like to know if this will do the job and also if there are any additional things that i'm going to need other than a case.
