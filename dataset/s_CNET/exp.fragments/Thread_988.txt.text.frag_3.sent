if set to auto the system goes through the detection process each boot. 
in the bios, try to detect each of the drives [no time limit in this detection] and enter those parameters in the bios rather than using auto. 
see if that helps. 
probably use lba on the right side of the entry. 
some time ago, i thought that i had read a post on on to extend thje toime that the boot allows to detect the drive before bowing out, but can't remember where.
