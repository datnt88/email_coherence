i follow the instruction in the weekend project and i have a problem. 
when i open the ''view worked computers'' in the pc, it only appears the name of itself. 
wheni open the ''view workgroup computers'' i see both the name of the notebook and the pc, but when i try to access the pc, it says ''\dell8300 is not accessible. 
you might not have a permission to use this network resource. 
contact the admin of this server to find out if you have access permissions. the network path is not found.'' im using di-524 as my router. 
both of my pc (wired) and notebook (wireless) connect in it. 
please help me before my brain gets blow-off!
