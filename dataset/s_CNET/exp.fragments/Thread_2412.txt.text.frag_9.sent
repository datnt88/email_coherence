in terms of p2p limewire is unparalleled in virus protection and keeping corrupted files to a minimum on the network. 
i get sick of people making up lies to smear the name of popular p2p programs. 
your 'tech' doesn't get bonuses from fixing a lot of machines, if he got a new car it had nothing to do with limewire. 
stfu, you are retarded. 
i don't know of any business that allows the usage of p2p software in the workplace. 
furthermore, the vast majority of viruses and malware are distributed via email and not through the p2p networks. 
your own personal email account is the biggest source of malware and viruses; whereas p2p networks are not only too slow to make mass distribution of malicious software feasible, the nature of p2p by definition prevents such files from becoming widely spread. 
upon downloading corrupt files, users simply delete them from their drives, thus no longer 'sharing' them and effectively removing them from the network. 
people who manage to download malware over p2p networks are the most inept computer users on the face of the planet. 
they have to somehow manage to find malicious files which are typically buried under millions of copies of good files which are being freely shared. 
then download the file, completely ignore the repeated warnings from limeware about downloading exe files, then ignore the warnings from their own anti virus software after the download is complete, and then intentionally double-click on the file and initiate the installation. 
it is an ineffective means to distribute malicious files. the most dangerous stuff on the internet is the stuff bombarding your email inbox on a daily basis, as all it takes is for you to accidentally open one email to allow it to render its active content and begin running malicious scripts on your machine. 
if these people weren't messing up their machines with limewire, they'd probably be preoccupied trying to put pop-tarts in their dvd player.
