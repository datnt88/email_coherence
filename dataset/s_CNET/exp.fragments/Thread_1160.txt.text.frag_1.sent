i built our computer about five years ago so we are well past the time when it needs to be replaced. 
i've been upgrading ram and storage as we go, but we've reached the end of the road with this one. 
i'm considering two different computers for purchase: one is a refurbished from buy.com, and one is a newer tower from best buy. 
regardless of which one i get i plan on installing a second hard drive (to separate the operating system from the data) which i'm guessing would void any warranty that comes with the machine. 
so bear that in mind. 
(related thread: ) i don't do any gaming or video editing so we are looking at photos, music, streaming video, etc. gateway dx4822-01 (refurb) $399
