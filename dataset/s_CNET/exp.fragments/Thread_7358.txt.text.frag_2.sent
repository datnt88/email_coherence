dear edward, i have just replied to the email you sent within the hour regarding this issue. 
i agree that the seven day period did not give enough time for the customer to submit the rebate. 
we value your opinion and appreciate your feedback. 
i assure you that all future rebates ran at retail stores will have at least a 14 day or more submission period. 
i apologize for the negative experience that you have had with our rebate. 
please contact me if you have any further questions or comments, my contact information is on my email reply. 
best regards, vivian wang retail account manager corsair memory, inc.
