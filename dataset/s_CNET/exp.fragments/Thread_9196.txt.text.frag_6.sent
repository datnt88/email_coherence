i have read the exact links several times but still the question that i am asking is, since my raid crashed before i knew anything about raid, i used a restoral disk that restored the system, however, i don't know how the remaining drive is configured. 
how do i replace the dead drive without running the risk of losing the data that is on the remaining disk. 
i agree that the raid array is not the way that i want to configure the system with the new drive. 
should i just set the new drive to slave and the old remaining drive to master? 
like i said before, the primary master and primary slave are not even listed as detected in the bios. 
i'm sorry if i'm having a hard time explaining exactly what my delimma is, as it may not be a delimma at all but i don't want to lose my data and i need to add space.
