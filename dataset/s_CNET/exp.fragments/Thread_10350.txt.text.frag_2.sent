do a printer &quot;self-test&quot;, review your manual or help guide on how that's done with your model printer. 
if it can't print a self-test page, then likely the printer is hosed. 
check to see that the ink carts are firmly seated and/or if any blinking leds are present on the printer. 
until, you do a self-test don't mess with windows at all, you may cause further problems. 
also, the support website at hp should explain common problems and resolutions. 
you can aslo try the printer's &quot;toolbox&quot; if applicable for your model, it should provide some insight and maybe a self-test as well. 
good luck -----willy
