to see how it's set up, troubleshooting becomes extremely difficult. 
can you see if the router has a way to reset it to defaults. 
i don't know that router so can't guide you but the user manual you have or can get on the web should tell you if this is possible and how to do it. 
generally, by default, all security is disabled and dhcp is enabled. 
this makes it very close to plug and play if your pc is also set to dhcp. 
of course this could mean your laptop won't connect when you get it back if it's been configured for that specific router.
