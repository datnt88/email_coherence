sorry if this is the wrong forum for this, but i am looking to build a pc for the first time and have no idea where to start. 
i found a guide to building one and it listed the parts i will need. 
i just have no idea which ones to get or where to buy them from. 
i don't want to spend a ton of money, but just get a good value. 
thanks for your help.
