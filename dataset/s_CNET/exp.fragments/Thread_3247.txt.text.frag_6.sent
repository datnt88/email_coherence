thank you for the tip... i welcome you to my home.. and i'll ask you to help setting up my wifi-lan .. lol in my place where i live.. personal cable connection is only 64k for every frequency blade .. when downloading something it only get under 10kbps, and not to many people use wifi in the road... they rather go a club or mall than doing wifi hunting .. atleast for now.. its ain't worthy to do warjacking(?) .. that is why my first priority is making the connection, then security.. i'll be back later with more question, when i get my accesspoint... see you later.. thank you again..
