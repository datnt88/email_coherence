nope still crashing :at i can't find the ram you purchased. 
this means we have to manually make sure the settings are spot on. 
go get cpuid from share the screen shot like this one -&gt; and on photobucket. 
supply all if possible. 
your board? 
that pdf shows that you do have control over the ram settings. 
i see a simple choice here. 
use ram from the qvl or dive in and ask them for the settings. 
i see the settings but don't post them here since i want you to tell.
