i finally found and corrected the problem. 
it seems there was an intermittently defective ide cable. 
i replaced the ide cable and everything works perfectly now. the drives are autodetected normally in bios and no more problems. 
simply replacing the old cable with a new one did the trick. 
thanks for all the responses and suggestions.
