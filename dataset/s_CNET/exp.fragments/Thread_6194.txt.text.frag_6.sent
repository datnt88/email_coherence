sorry, the wpn824 is version 1 and the firmware is newly updated. 
i agree the post is a little long, here's a hopefully somewhat clearer version: netgear wpn824 router, version 1, newest firmware. 
windows xp computer with the patch that's supposed to get it to show up on vista network screen installed. 
it has an intel pro/100 network adapter, unsure on the exact details of this but i can find out if need be. 
this computer's wired and has no problems with internet. 
windows vista computer with a broadcom 802.11g network adapter. 
this computer gets constantly disconnected, has absolutely terrible internet speed, problems getting the xp computer to show up on the network map, and terrible transfer speeds even on the times it does decide to show up. 
i will try again everything i can find in the sticky, but here are the questions: is the hardware i have okay? 
i mean, is the problem likely to be compatibility issues between any of the parts of the network? 
how much of an issue is it that the xp computer is a bit old and relatively slow, and that it's the one connected to the modem and router? 
will upgrading any of the equipment be likely to help? 
i understand nobody's paying you for this and i think what you're doing is great. 
i don't expect you to completely solve it for me but i have no idea where to even start. 
nothing i try makes any dent and it's a bit frustrating...
