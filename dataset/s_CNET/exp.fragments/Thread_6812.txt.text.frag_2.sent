would tax me as well. 
&quot;the thing wouldn't let connect to internet on the host computer! 
but the connection was on. 
on the wireless computer i got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet.' a confusing statement, clarification is needed. 
how many computers are on this lan and how do they connect. 
&quot;next i attached a linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back. 
then i hooked the 624 to the linsky router. 
now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet.&quot; 
this is where it gets muddy when you put two routers together. 
simplify this network down to one router and give d-link tech support a call.
