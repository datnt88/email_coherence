i've prepared myself for the possibility of doing just that- swapping out logic boards, but somewhere- and i can't find the bookmark- i read that i can use my firmware chip on the donor board so a total match in firmware revision isn't critical. 
since this seems to be a widely 'popular' problem, certain drives are becoming extinct and prohibitively expensive to find an exact match.
