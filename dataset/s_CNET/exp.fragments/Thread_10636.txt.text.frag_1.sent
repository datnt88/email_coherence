hello, iv recently been experiencing very poor network quality. 
i also just upped my cable speeds to 12mbps but it feels like it slowed down due to all the disconnecting. 
i have a motorola surfboard sb4200 cable modem which is about 6 years old and a linksys wrt54g wireless router which is almost 4 years old. 
when i first set up my home network, we only had 2 computers connecting to the internet, a compaq desktop pc which is connected via cat-5 to the back of the router and an hp laptop that connects over the wireless. 
recently our family has added 2 more laptops and an xbox 360 to the network. 
all was good for about 3-4 months then we started getting disconnected frequently. 
iv had people tell me its my network security, so iv tried non at all, wep, and wpa, all giving me nothing. 
i tried flashing the router with dd-wrt, nothing changed at all, still getting disconnected randomly. 
its like the router has a mind of its own. 
iv also been told to trade in for a new modem, which is what i will end up doing if nothing else works. 
i would really appreciate some help.
