i am currently having an issue with a new server build i am working on(extended atx tower)...it is an asus z8ped12 mobo with two xeon 5520 cpus...the ps is an ocz 500w with two 12v rails (1 4pin and 1 8pin connector for the cpus). 
i have used a 4pin to 8pin adapter so that both 8pin female power jacks are used on the mobo. 
when i first turned on the system, it would reboot about 5-7 min after starting...it would do this cycle many times until i just turned it off. 
i tried it today and the server will not turn on at all...do i need a better suited ps? this is seemingly a power issue...any thoughts?
