i'm not sure why you can't get it to work with usb. 
my external is also sata on the inside and works fine. 
my asus mb is 5 years old now so it's old by some standards. 
i can even see the external's drive letters when booting from dos disks. 
it would seem if you could do that you could get the hds fully id'd. 
perhaps the external enclosure's interface is the problem.
