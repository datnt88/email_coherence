you also didn't mention a fan and that could be important. 
9 screws is quite a lot. the difference could be in how you sequence the process of seating the screws. 
you'd need to hold the heat sink in place firmly while seating them. 
you'd need to try your best to bring down the screws opposite one another just to the point of feeling resistance until all screws felt the same. 
you'd repeat that sequencing in small increments until the screws were snug but not tight. 
never would the torque sequence just be done by cw or ccw motion. 
i can almost guarantee this will cause the heat sink to list on the gpu. it may be possible that some component in the temperature sensing circuit got damaged and you're getting false readings. 
you do want to make sure that you get proper air flow and this might mean moving cards around or adding a fan directed on the heat sink if it doesn't already have one.
