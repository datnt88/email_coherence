what you're trying to do is make a nas setup and that won't happen with a non-nas ext. 
hd. you are going to need a small network setup where the hd is attached to one system and the under the network become a &quot;shared resource&quot; for that network. 
if you plan to use multiple ports from that ext. 
hd to attach to separate systems, no workee or expect problems.
