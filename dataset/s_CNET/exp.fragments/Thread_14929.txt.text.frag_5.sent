the computer is about 4 years old. 
the cmos battery was remove because i had blue screen of death whenever i power up my computer. 
a friend told me by removin cmos battery i can reset the cmos and my computer would start up without the blue screen. 
so i did follow his direction and then i try to start up, it didnt power up.
