that is probably being caused by mal-adjusted eax settings go into the eax control panels and see if anything is set wrong (mostly with cmss and cmss2...) or if any effects or karoke mode is on kaeroke mode should be off all the time and effects are only if your playing around, but geneerally should be off and cmss is your choice i hate cmss 1 cmss 2 and stereo surround work much better
