all we know: the power supply works and the fans and motherboard are powered. 
it's up to you to find out what's wrong. 
possibilities include: - bad motherboard, cpu, memory, video card, monitor or cables - wrong or bad connections the least that should happen is the bios showing itself on the monitor, indeed. 
hope you find it.
