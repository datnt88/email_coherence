hi guys. 
im trying to find a bday present for my girl and i remembered shes been moaning about not having wireless printing capability. 
i figure it might have been a hint... shes got a brother hl-5140 printer and a sony pcg - frv25 laptop. 
i cant find anything to work with her printer other than brother's expensive wireless print server. 
and i dont think her laptop has bluetooth. 
any help is appreciated. 
thanks!
