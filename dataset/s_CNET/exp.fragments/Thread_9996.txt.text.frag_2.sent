but driver update is the last tool i suggest using. 
if you keep at this you learn to find the driver from the maker first. 
also, code 39 is one of the well discussed failures. 
if it's working don't fix this. 
also 4gb on 32 bit oses tend to do this a lot. 
chalk it up to bad choices made years ago.
