i want to upgrade the ram memory of my dell dimension 2400. 
there is a 256mb chip in slot #1. slot #2 is empty. 
can i put in a larger ram chip in slot #2, leaving the old 256mb chip in the computer ?? or putting it another way, what's the most economical way of upgrading the ram memory of my computer??
