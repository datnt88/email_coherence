the best i could find was a 256mb pny geforce 6200 which was running ddr ram, and it's clock's were no where near the 5700 ultra. 
6200 5700 ultra core: 350 core: 475 mem: 533 mem: 900 ddr 256mb gddr2 128mb 64 bit 128bit i also found a 6800 xt but it's clocks are still worse than 5700 ultra and it cost $70, it did have 256mb gddr2, but it runs slower and their is more memory to deal with so the 5700 ultra would still be better, so unless i find a 6900 thats better i'm sticking to the 5700 ultra. 
this is by no means the card i'm staying with but it's thirty five bucks new, and it will last until march when i plan on getting a 7600gt or 7300gt, i like nvidia better than ati. 
yes i understand that the p4 would be way better than the p3 or intel would have never released it. 
but if the p3 system has a more ram and a way better gpu then it should still out perform the p4 system, right? 
thanks, bigboy
