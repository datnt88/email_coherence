&quot;they pins on the ribbon for the headphone and jack from the case are: l-in - white wire l-out - red wire grnd - black mice - in - orange r-out - red r-in - white mic - in - green grnd - blk&quot; these seem clear to me. 
except the &quot;mice&quot; one. 
&quot;the confusing thing is the pins on the motherboard seem to be marked differently then what is in the manual. 
but the pin setup is the same with 5pin on the left and a 3 blank 1 pin on the right. 
if anyone can sort this out for me or point me in the right direction i would greatly appreciate it.&quot; the manual is often a rushed affair. 
see if the maker's web site has a newer manual and from experience, the marking on the motherboard is often correct.
