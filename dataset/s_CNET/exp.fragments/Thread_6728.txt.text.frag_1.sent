i am looking for a way to get voice through my computer to my telephone. 
i do not have voip. 
perhaps this is very basic, but i cannot seem to find a way to use a bluetooth head set with my desktop and outlook to dial and then speak on the telephone wirelessly. 
i have vista ultimate, blue tooth headset, usb modem, and office professional 2007. 
if not bluetooth, is there another wireless headset that you know of that you would recommend? 
thanks, allen
