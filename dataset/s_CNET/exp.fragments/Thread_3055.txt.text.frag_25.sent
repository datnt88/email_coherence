if you really want a good answer then you need to supply us with more information. 
what motherboard do you have, video card, type of hard drive etc.... also what software are you trying to run? 
how much can you spend? 
what os are you using? 
with this info you will get a much better answer. 
also it would help if you defined what your current power supply is. 
you may also want to tell us how you connect to the internet. 
cnet has some great programs that will tune your system so it works great. 
if your unsure how to go about getting the info on your computer i am sure someone with netmeeting can browse your sytem and the tell you or even fix most of your problems remotely.
