i have the same problem. 
my gm 5478 is one month and 3 days old. 
contacted gateway tech support. 
she wanted to run recovery set up. 
i told her no, it was not software issue it seemed like hardware or power supply issue. 
she then suggested i reseat the ram, duh. 
i asked if they had anything on this issue. 
she just answered i could take the tower to where i purchased it for repair. 
nice!
