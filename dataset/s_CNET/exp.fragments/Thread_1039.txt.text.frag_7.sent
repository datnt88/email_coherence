hibernating doesn't take any more power than shutting down, as all memory is dumped to disk and the hardware is switched off. 
you can hibernate your machine, pull the plug, leave it for days, weeks, or months, and still come back to restart to right where you left off. 
granted it doesn't give you the memory clean up of a cold boot, since whatever was in memory before gets loaded back when you restart, but it has all the same power saving benefits as a shutdown.
