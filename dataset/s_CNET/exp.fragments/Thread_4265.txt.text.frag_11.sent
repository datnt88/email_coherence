i have a brother printer as well. 
i suspect that you model has the memory card readers built in. 
if i remove a memory card prior to shut down then ms will hang up at shut down. 
it wants to save the files even though they are no longer open. 
i don't have the same problem with standard memory sticks or usb models for sd cards, just when i use the slots in the brother printer. 
given that you probably would catch on to that error, i would try try uninstall and reinstall the brother printer software.
