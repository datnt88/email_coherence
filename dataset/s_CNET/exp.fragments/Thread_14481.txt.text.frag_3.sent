as soon as i click on something it just locks up - i have another hd from an old computer that i have to take ownership of - that's just no the case for this hd. i do think it may have something to do with the registry - the program from ms that addresses &quot;file not found&quot; registry errors cannot be selected for an external hd which this is - any suggestions? 
thanks in advanced- matt
