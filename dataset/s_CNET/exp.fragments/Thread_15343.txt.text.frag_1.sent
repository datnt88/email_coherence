is ocing graphics card a good idea? 
it's certainly a lot easier than ocing a cpu. 
easily done through software, and less guesswork. 
but how much ocing would be good? 
unitl you get artifacts? is it likely for gpus to burn out because of overclocking? 
what about the ram? 
what happenes with that?
