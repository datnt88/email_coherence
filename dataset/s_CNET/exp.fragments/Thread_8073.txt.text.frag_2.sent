the office works on apps so at my desk i have the nexus 7 32gb and a tf300t transformer. 
but the problem as i see it is i don't see how you could replace the common laptop with either. 
i did stumble over a deal for an asus for 300 which is pretty nice if touchscreen is what you were after. 
it was a refurb and the office popped for it and it's not bad. 
my only wish was it's fan was a bit quieter but for 300, i'm in.
