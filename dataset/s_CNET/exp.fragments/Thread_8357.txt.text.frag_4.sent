bob, thanks for the reply. 
i realize word is not a typesetter. 
i use pagemaker for that, at least my daughter does she's the graphic artist. 
but i thought it would at least be able to do justification. 
guess i was wrong. 
at work we use interleaf to produce our technical manuals but we have had all sorts of consultants come in and suggest we switch to word since interleaf support may be going away. 
can't wait to see what they say about this fiasco. 
you said to get openoffice. 
that used to be a freebe, but i seem to remember that sun is now charging for it. is there still a free version? 
reason i ask is i have abdobe (at least my daughter does) so i can probably use it distiller program to convert the file to pdf. 
all i gotta do if figure out how. 
again thanks for the reply. 
john
