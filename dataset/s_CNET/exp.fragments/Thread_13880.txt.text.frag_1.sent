when i bought my laptop from ibuypower, the instant it loaded up, it detected a wireless connection. 
now, after i reinstalled windows since a gnarly crash, it will not even aknowledge the ability to detect wireless connections. 
there is no . the horrible service reps could only give me a site with drivers, but after installation, still no luck. 
i also get this message when i try to install the driver for intel pro/wireless network. 
no matching driver has been found fot your adapter or no adapter is installed. 
do you wish to proceed with this installation?
