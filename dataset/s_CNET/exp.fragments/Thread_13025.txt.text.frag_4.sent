i have removed the media from the bad drive and installed it in a known good drive. 
(i have facilities to do this kind of stuff) the heads seek but never find home. 
finally, drive gives up and stays parked. 
i have tried total recall but they will not talk technical also, want $&gt;k to recover. 
i can't afford. 
if i can talk to knowledgeable tech i will learn what i don't know and may be successful. 
how?
