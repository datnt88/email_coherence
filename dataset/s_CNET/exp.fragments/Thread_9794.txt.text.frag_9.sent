i tried what you said and that still didn't work. 
i called and talked with hp and they couldn't get it to work either so then i called at&t my dsl service and they still couldn't get it to work so my last phone call yesterday was to linksys and they said that my router is faulty because none of the troubleshooting steps we did worked. 
they said i need to buy a new router. 
i don't know much about routers. 
can anyone please give me some suggestions on which routers i should consider? 
i want to make sure i get a router that will work with my laptop, desktop (both have windows xp if you need to know that) and my hp officejet 6310 all-in-one printer. 
let me know if there is anything else you need to know. 
i use both computers for work at home. 
i look forward to hearing the suggestions on routers that i should look into. 
thanks, renee
