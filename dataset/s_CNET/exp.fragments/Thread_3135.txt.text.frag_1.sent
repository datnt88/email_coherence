my emachine t2682 desktop's motherboard recently died. 
i replaced the motherboard with a biostar p4m80-m4 from tigerdirect. 
even though it is my first time, i believe i have replaced the motherboard properly and all the wires are firmly connected but when i tried to turn on my computer, no display turned up on my monitor and the lights on my keyboard wouldn't turn on. 
however,a usb device receives power when plugged in, the fan inside the computer still spins, the lights on the hard drive and power button still turn on and the computer sounds as though it is turning on like it did before the motherboard was replaced. 
i don't understand why there is no display on my monitor as i have tested it 2 different monitors. 
any help would be appreciated.
