i have a problem with the wireless connection on my mum's laptop. 
it's been working fine but recently the message &quot;wireless network connection not connected&quot; has appeared. 
we can no longer connect through wireless. 
i've tried re-enabling it but no luck. 
i've tried the windows repair option but no luck. 
i've tried setting up the network again but still nothing. 
when i try to view available networks it says none in range. is this a hardware failure? 
can anyone advise me?? more info we normally have to press a button for it to search the wireless networks and now when we press it nothing happens. 
also if i right click the monitors and click view avaliable wireless networks its blank and nothing comes up!! although there are at least 3/4 networks around my area including ours.
