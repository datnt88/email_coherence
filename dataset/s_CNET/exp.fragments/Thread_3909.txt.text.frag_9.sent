i had to scramble for my dictionary when i saw your use of word: fungible. 
initially, it sounded like derogatory... anyways, it was good you looked at my other thread, and this one as they are surely related. 
as a developer, i am pretty much at ease with ports, tcp/ip and all, just that i have not used them for a remote connection type of thing outside windows ra/rdc. 
looks like i need to get my hands dirty. 
whenever i do, i will try to find a reproducible series of steps that other can use to accomplish what i am trying. 
and i will document them here!!!
