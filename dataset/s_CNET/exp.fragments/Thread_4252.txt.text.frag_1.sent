i have an hp pavilion 9600. 
it's a 7 year old computer, so it's old. 
i don't want to get rid of it just yet, so i'm using it to download music. the only problem is that when i hook up my ipod to it, it displays the hardware found message, then it displays an error message and says the device will not function properly. 
does this mean that i need to change my usb card? 
thanks.
