you are saying that's -sixty voltages, not six volts? 
since, you swapped the psu out and it still a problem then be sure to reduce the system to the bare minimum. 
remove all devices, etc. and just make a bare system, remove/uplug all drives at least. 
that way you can return devices if voltage become stable before doing so. the device that seems to bring it down, then that's a iffy part. 
when a psu problem blows-up a system it may take down other components/devices. 
be sure also that all cables, etc. are firmly attached/seated. 
i'll check the wiring crimps as well.
