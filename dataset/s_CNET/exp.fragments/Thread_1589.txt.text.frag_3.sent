a higher figure is better in all your categories, but don't rely on those raw fill rate/memory bandwidth figures when comparing cards with different gpus. 
pick a budget, find some cards that fit in your budget, then start reading some reviews on those cards. 
use benchmark charts like this: and this: to compare performance. 
also, don't be fooled into thinking that a card is automatically better because it has 512mb of ram. 
a x1300 w/512mb is still slower than a x1600 w/256mb.
