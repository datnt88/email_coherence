i am using windows xp p4 2ghz 736 ram. 
i purchased a usb 2 external enclosure and put an old 10gig hard dive in it.( 
i want to image my current hard drive and to do that i must plug it directly into usb on computer.. ) i plugged it into a hub which i forgot was usb 1 and windows found hard drive and told me i was plugging high speed drive into low speed port and to unplugg it and plug it into on of 4 high speed ports listed. 
( the enclosure operates perfectly when plugged into the hub, i can read and write to the drive). 
when i plug enclosure directly into usb port on the computer xp does not find it. 
i have unplugged hub and used same port. 
i only have two ports on computer even though xp says i have 4. (maybe two more in case?) i have used system restore, uninstalled hub, etc. when i plug in hub xp find hub no problem but not the enclosure. 
i am lost.. can anyone please help?? thanks
