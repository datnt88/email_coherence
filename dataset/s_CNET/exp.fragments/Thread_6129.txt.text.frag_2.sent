open case and with power-off, reseat the cables to that drive. 
reseat several times, including the power cable. 
restart system and check results. 
if it works, great, you had minor problem. 
upon boot-up does the bios report it? 
if not, then more than likely the cd drive is dead or done in, replace. 
while there can be s/w glithces, more often than not, h/w failure is the cause, nothing can be repaired, just replace. 
if you were having some difficlties prior to this, that's a good reason to replace. 
you can try cleaning the drive out, but that's alast gasp effort. 
i leave any other possible cause to other posters. 
i found so many cd drive problems are resolved by replacement and thier cost is very reasonable.
