hi, i'm going to describe a problem i'm having, maybe someone can throw me an idea. 
i have a laptop. 
it's a dell inspiron 5000 with w2k. it has one mouse/keyboard port and one serial port. 
i'm trying to hook up a mouse and a keyboard to the laptop. 
mouse has to be hooked up to the serial port, i have an adapter for it. 
problem: when everything is hooked up, the system does not see the mouse on the serial port, only touchpad works. 
i already checked in the bios and the touchpad is set to [auto, disable], as it's supposed to. 
anyone would have any idea why the system would not switch to the serial mouse automatically? 
thanks.
