this is where a service shop has the advantage. 
but at an average 120 dollar bill, you might beat them on that price even if you had to buy a new power supply, motherboard and cpu. 
since it's an amd cpu and those do fry in under 1 second if the heatsink is not on proper, it's my first guess. 
next is the power supply which you can test on another machine (spare parts?), but at 20-30 dollars for a 450 watt psu, that may be your first choice.
