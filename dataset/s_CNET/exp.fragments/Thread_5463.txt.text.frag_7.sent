excellent explanation zooyorker6! 
i never new that the fsb's speed was important. 
i found a gateway clone basicly of the gateway i have listed in my first post, only it has the core 2 duo processor. 
here is the weird thing though. 
gateway with core 2 duo: processor speed 2.13 ghz fsb 1066 mhz gateway listed in my first post with athlon 6000+ processor speed 3.0 ghz fsb 2.0 ghz which is pretty good, right? 
and the core 2 duo cost $100 more than the athlon computer, but i guess thats is coming down in price next week like you said. 
still the athlon 6000+ i found on compusa.com has a higher fsb and processor speed, so this would mean that is a better pc than the core 2 duo i found on compusa.com? 
my only other concerns are is the nvidia geforce 8500gt a good graphics card? 
(i think i can buy a new one to put in the gateway though if it is a bad card.) and it doesn't look like these gateways come with a monitor... anyone know where i can find a nice, low priced lcd flat monitor? 
thanks so much zooyorker6 and all for you help! 
i'm not good enough at computers to make one with the parts so your help is greatly appreciated! 
here is them compared.. i hope the link works!
