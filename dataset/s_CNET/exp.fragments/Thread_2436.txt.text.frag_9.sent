let me just write a bit and maybe it will sink in. 
when you connect to a remote vpn, what should happen is ... as if you had connected into that network. 
all the brutal limitations come into play. 
example: let's say you have a lan at home.. it should vanish since it's not in the vpn. 
also, how you logon to your machine must be a valid account for the remote lan (vpn). 
many will forget this step... and i'm only beginning to see how the remote vpn is setup. 
usually your it staff sets up the vpn server.
