many motherboard will activate dual channel if each bank has the same amount of ram. 
so you could put your 2 existing 512mb sticks in one bank, and a new 1gb stick in the second bank. 
(see your mobo/pc manual to identify which bank a slot is part of.) if 2gb is your goal, that's probably the best way to go since all 3 sticks will be running at full ddr-400 speed.
