i have the exact same issue with a linksys befsx41 and verizon dsl. 
annoying, isn't it? 
it started about 10-12 days ago. 
yesterday i replaced the router with a different brand, and it did the exact same thing (once). 
i called up the isp, and we tested the connect without a router: it was all good. 
then they bounced/reset something on their end and i've been good-to-go ever since. 
i did, however try the linksys once again this morning, in the hopes i could return the new router, but had no luck. 
i reset it to the factory defaults, power-cycled everything (twice)...still wouldn't grab an ip from the modem. 
nothing at all. 
it would time-out trying to renew its ip address. 
i think it's fubar. 
good luck with yours!
