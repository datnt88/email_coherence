i'm upgrading to a a amd athlon 64 x2 4200+ chip and asus m3a amd 770 motherboard. 
i'm running xp. i bought new ram, and then i thought i might need to upgrade the video card as well. 
the video card is about 7 or 8 years old. 
the paper work says it's a ati radeon 64mb ddr agp. 
i guess i should upgrade the video card, and i will, but i just want to put everything together to make sure everything works. 
if i can, i'd rather wait to get the video card.
