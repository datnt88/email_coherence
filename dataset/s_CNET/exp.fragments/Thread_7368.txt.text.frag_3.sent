but your manager is right in essence, if you always wait, you will never have one, the one you just bought probably would be useful for several years, depending on what you need to do with it. 
its like this with all tech.. my firm belief is get the best processor you can afford on comps, worry about the rest later, easy enough to expand the rest. 
tablets are different as most are really self contained units, what you buy is what you get, but it all depends on what you need it for. 
me , im looking for one that basically does two things 90% of the time, stream a few movies and read books, the rest is play some music and hold a few files.
