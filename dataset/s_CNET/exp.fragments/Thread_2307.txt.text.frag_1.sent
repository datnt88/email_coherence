i am looking at used workstations. 
any suggestions? 
looking at the dells specifically. 
i will install hard drive, more ram or os if necessary. 
any recommendations on workstations versus building one myself. 
i don't plan on using it for gaming, video editing or design. 
only want it for web surfing and home office use.
