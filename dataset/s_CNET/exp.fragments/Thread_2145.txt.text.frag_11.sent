hi bob - again, thanks for walking me through this. 
i am not familiar with peripheral/port/driver issues. 
i tried reinstalling the drivers with the uac off, but the printer does not work and i get the same error message (operation is not supported). 
i have a feeling this printer may be a very expensive dud. 
i'll ship it back to amazon tomorrow. 
thanks again for your help.
