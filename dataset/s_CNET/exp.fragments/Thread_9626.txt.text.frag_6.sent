you want the ati silencer as it implements otes, which removes the heat from the case... another idea run the case with the side panel off also are you sure it's not gpu recover doing the damage? 
(it's ati's stupid &quot;if the gpu gets stuck in an endless loop it gets turned off&quot; program, but instead it just terminates the card randomly (in catalyst 4.7 it did, idk about the current version) other options would be: larger fan/faster fan better case cooling the ati silencer also is your psu capable of handeling the gfx card? 
350w or more with a good +12v rail?
