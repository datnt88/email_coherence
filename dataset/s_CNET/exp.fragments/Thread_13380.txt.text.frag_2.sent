try this. 
if it has the speedstep feature then you can slow the machine down and hopefully, if its a heat issue, you can complete the scan. 
if not, look to a dos based scanner like fprot to see if it finds a pest. 
in closing, no details about the laptop, operating system and not much else means i can only offer generic advice which may be unuseful.
