an indoor antenna would possibly pick up a station?? there are a few that are reasonably good designs and offer some minimal gain. 
i would guess that any outside antenna on the roof would establish a precedent and every body would want one. 
need to get the dorm members together to share with the costs for satellite and a good didtribution amplifier. 
from the roof in a cornfield the view south should be clear as a bell. 
make a small corp that would carry on every year. 
good luch.
