thanks for your response, kees. 
i'm not quite sure how to do what you suggested. 
i have gone through the network and sharing center on the problem desktop to disconnect it from the wireless connection and reconnect it, several times. 
also, the computer connects to the router automatically every time i restart the computer. 
i'm not sure how to get the problem computer to &quot;forget&quot; the router password, but i tried changing the password it uses to connect, at which point it failed to connect to the router. 
then i changed it back to the correct password, and it connected to the router again, but still no internet access. 
there is no wireless switch on the desktop, the computer runs on windows vista (not ubuntu), and i can't take it to a public hotspot, but i'll see if i can find a system restore point. 
if that works, i'll post an update. 
if there are any other suggested solutions, please let me know!
