not necessary to have a switch on both ends as long as you have enought ports to use. 
but i placed the wireless router for you on both ends to allow your laptop (or any wifi devices) to roam between two location. 
routing function should not be use on router #2 (wan port should not be plugged in at all). 
dhcp should be disable. the purpose of wireless router #2 is to provide wirless access to your network for all your wifi devices.
