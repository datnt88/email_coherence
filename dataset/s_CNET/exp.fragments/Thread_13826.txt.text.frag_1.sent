hi there, i have a laptop (win xp sp3) which connects to the internet via wireless connection. 
configuration is as follows: laptop connects to ap1 (wireless) ap1 connects to ap2 (ethernet cable) ap2 connects to ap3 (wireless)(ap3 is somewhere in the neighbourhood, i dont know where) some of the aps or all of them may work as bridges, i dont know since i do not have access to their interfaces. 
i have a desktop, which is connected to my laptop with a crossover ethernet cable. 
wireless connection details: ip: 192.168.1.72 mask: 255.255.0.0 gateway: 192.168.3.2 dns: 192.168.3.2 lan details: laptop's ip: 10.10.10.1 desktop's ip: 10.10.10.2 mask: 255.255.255.0 i want to share the laptop's internet connection with my desktop. 
tried ics, bridging, etc. but nothing seems to be working. 
how do i do that? 
any ideas?
