i have today purchased a seagate 160gb usb 2.0 drive and it was as simple as pie to install. 
plug in the power lead, plug in the usb lead, switch on and windows xp (sp2) recognised the drive, assigned a letter, and i am good to go. 
i am currently researching using it as my primary data drive (i will continue to backup to cd / dvd of course) and transferring the my documents folder to it.
