the unit is configurable and many can't make them work. 
i've been a bit lucky with such things. 
it's a bit odd to try it as slave. the unit i had only worked by it's lonesome on the primary ide channel. 
that is, i set the switch, plugged it into the motherboard primary ide channel and it worked. 
but then again i had to install the os which for some is like building a moon shuttle in their garage. 
here's another card i'll try next week. 
i'll try it with a few configurations such as one drive, no drives in the pc which has no sata ports, etc. so it should be fun.
