i have a macbook pro (the first generation) with 2.16ghz core duo and 1gig of ram (hopefully upgrading that soon). 
i was hoping to be able to install vista on an external harddrive and somehow run it with bootcamp without installing it directly onto my laptop's on-board harddrive. 
any suggestions as to how to go about doing this?
