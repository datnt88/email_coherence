hey all - i am setting up a new small office network and i want to make sure my design using cisco routers is adequate for what i am wanting to do. 
i will have a 27mbps network connection, approx 20 users wired/wireless, 10 of which will be wired desktops/laptops, printers, the other 10 likely to connect via wireless. 
i am not expecting excessive file transfers or large amounts of streaming however, i would like to only have to adjust my bandwidth and not the physical solution if that becomes a requirement. 
my plan is to buy the cisco ea4500 wireless router and the se2800 8 port gigabit ethernet switch. 
will this setup keep consistent performance across wireless and wired connections? 
what can these handle in concurrent connections performing normal daily email and web browsing? 
is there a more recommended setup i should implement? 
thank you for your help!
