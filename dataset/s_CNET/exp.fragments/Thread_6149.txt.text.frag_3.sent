get a lightscribe dvd/cd burner and discs and print directly to the dics without a printer. 
prices have come down and they work great. 
there are a couple draw backs. 
it is a pretty slow process, about 15 to 20 mins per disc. 
another is right now there is only one color, but hp is coming out with more colors this spring.
