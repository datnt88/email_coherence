like the btx type case. the mobo is accessed from the right side rather than the left. 
intel has been pushing the btx in order to improve cooling, however they have basically given up. 
no mfr's have jumped on the btx bandwagon, and intel is dumping the p4's and their cooling problems and coming out with a complete new line of cpu's that do not run as hot, and thus the atx cases will be fine once more. 
i know nothing about the eatx, however with the standard atx, one can get similar cooling airflow by using a fan such as this note that the fan is perpendicular to the cpu surface so that airflow goes through the heatsink unobstructed, rather than blowing down through the heatsink into the surface of the cpu which creates a large back pressure.. this was the main point of the btx cooling design. 
they relocated the cpu on the mobo to make a more straight through path for airflow from the front to rear of the tower. 
i believe that by mounting the mobo upside down they are trying to accomplish the samer thing, while not requiring a btx type mobo. 
[because nobody wants to make them. 
lol]
