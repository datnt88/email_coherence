i found a 2nd hand etherfast cable/dsl router and want to try and hook it up. 
it has an ethernet cable and power supply cord. 
i has a 4-port switch. 
what i have is a computer with dsl, and a box/modem with the first plugin for dsl, 2nd, usb, 3rd, ethernet, and 4th power. the ethernet is plugged into the back of the tower. 
i am wondering how to hook up the linksys(where to plug it in)and also, it doesn't have a little antenna which i though all of these did. 
i don't see anyplace where one might have been either? 
any help is appreciated. 
i have windows vista sp2 and can give you further info if needed. 
i want to be able to pick up the dsl signal from my laptop;) denise
