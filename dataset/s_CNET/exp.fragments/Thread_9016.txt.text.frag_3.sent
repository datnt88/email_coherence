thank you bob for your response. 
i will take that into consideration as i proceed. 
however i still am not sure i can copy from one external hard drive to another. 
i assume i can simultaneously plug both into the usb ports on the desktop and then drop the files from the 1st external hard drive i have been saving to over the weeks into the 2nd external hard drive. 
correct? 
thanks
