actually you can find pentium iii's on ebay and pricegrabber for a good price if it's a slot 1 pentium ii box, you can run slot i pentium iii's in there (if their sub 900mhz ones, as pentium ii and pentium iii are very very close to each other in design (less difference than northwood to prescott) i would still agree with them on this though, just get a new machine
