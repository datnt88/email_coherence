just bpought a hp3535 and it blurs the photos on the stock i was using a hp3500 but with windows 7 there are no drivers for it....the hp3525 works only if you print 1 sheet at a time and then let it cool frustrating...so i searched the net and your problem came up....was wondering if you ever resolved it
