the research is the important part a good price may not be a good deal. the more i know the better i can shop. 
in the future i may buy more on line but now i stick to off line shopping. 
with compusa closing this might change. 
they were the best stocked store in the area now that there gone. 
i'm scrambling for a new store or two to take there place. 
this will not be easy to do.
