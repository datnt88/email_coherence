greetings, i ran into some simular issues, mostly in regards to my photo and music librarys, but do i really want to download the same drivers _over and over_ again? 
think nas: network attached storage. 
buffalow makes a wonderfull product called &quot;linkstation&quot; which once attached via 10/100 cable to my lan, acts as a central archive for all my data. 
the nas products are ~$100-200 more expensive then the usb drive solutions, however you don't have to worry about drive format or driver issues. 
all you need is tcpip/lan/share software loaded (comes with all versions of windows). 
whats also nice is that its readly available to all workstations all the time. 
meaning, i can download the latest version of opera, store it on my nas while in my home office and later tonight while watching tv with the laptop on, i can install from the nas without re-downloading opera! 
having my data (music/photos) stored in one place also comes in handy as well as saving drive space. 
i don't have to have my 23+gb photo library copied onto all my laptops/workstations. its like having a extra drive for all computers in the house. 
it also comes with backup software as well as being compatable with nerobackup. 
i'd highly recommend a nas device over a external usb device any day. 
best of luck, mark.
