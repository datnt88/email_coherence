our company installs computers sytems using tripplite (basic) ups/battery back-up. 
computer and monitor are hooked to the battery side or this ups while the printer goes into the surge protector part. 
this has been a good set-up with hp's 5p, 6p, 2100, 2200 series. 
we are encountering a problem with some 2300's, in which the printer is working fine and within a few days it will not print via lpt1. 
replacing the cable does not fix the problem. 
sometimes a full shut down (of all equipment) starts it up again. 
we encountered that if the printer is replace, the new printer works perfectly. 
also, the old printer is then connected somewhere else without any problems. 
has anyone encountered this problem?
