i'll post what i posted in home audio/video (but got no advice). 
maybe someone here can help. 
i have used an adaptec capture card bundled with dvd and intervideo windvr3 software to back up or copy tv programing from my dish network receiver feed, my vhs tapes, and my audio/video files on my hard drive (the latter mostly saved by using the bundled software i list above). the capture card i have has become obsolete with no support or driver/firmware updates, and using it now results in errors, freezes, crashes, poor results, and/or all of the above. 
to make things simple i'm posting the card url so that you all can see the features, and description for both hardware and bundled software. 
i have looked far and wide for a internal card or even external usb box to replace the adaptec and bundled software but not been able to find anything that's current, has the same features as the adaptec, or has reasonably good customer reviews without all sorts of discouraging cons. 
you all know the name brands out there and i think i've looked at them all. 
anything i missed? 
any suggestions? 
i still have a lot of burning of my vhs tapes to dvd as well as tv recording to do and would like to pick up where adaptec left me hanging. 
ok, that's it, i'd really like to stay with a capture card like the adaptec i document in that other forum post. 
anyone??????? thanks in advance.
