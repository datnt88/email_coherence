what do you mean by saying this: &quot;other then that i don't have any coolant as such&quot;? is this suppose to be a water-cooled setup? 
have you completed the install of it? 
if not or i digress then what air cooling is involved. 
further, are you sure this setup was done properly, using cpu paste, secured mounting and/or correct one to include the right hsf for that cpu type and rating. 
have optional case cooling fans been installed? 
come back with results. 
i only mention this if they maybe required as std. 
install and not present. 
verify what the heat range in the bios the &quot;default &quot; is, though i suspect it should be correct. 
also, the bios setting for &quot;temp overheat&quot; while also at default, what action does it take, shutdown, reboot or slows down(cpu setting only). 
60c is too much imho. 
i like to see in the 50c+ range when it gets high. 
however, proper cooling even if it reports high can make it all work well. 
the monitoring s/w too often reports incorrectly and should be taken at 10% off value.
