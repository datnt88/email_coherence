hi. my comuter wont detect my nvidia fx5500 video card. 
yesterday it was working fine then i tried to connect the video card with my tv with the s-video cabe, then the monitor turned off and the video drivers were uninsatalled, the pc wont detect the video card now, its a pci card, i have tried changing pci slots and almost everything, still it doesn't work. 
im thinking reseting the video card bios but i dont know how to do that, the video card s working correctly, the cooler turns on and the video card gets hot when you turn on the computer... cananyone help please? 
thanks, stefan
