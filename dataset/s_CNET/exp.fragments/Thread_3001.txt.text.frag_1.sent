i am looking to buy or maybe build a new gaming computer, and have no idea where to start. 
i realize that with building a computer, i will save some money, but i have no experience in computer building and am not sure that i have the time. 
i would really like not spend more than $1400-$1500, while still being able to play most new games. 
any suggestions for a prebuilt computer or computer building specs? 
thanks, shlomo
