i decline to duplicate web content about firmware updates that add capability. 
if you want to discuss it, supply links to the firmware and the drive so i don't have to dig it up. the booktype and it's relationship to dvd(+/-r) media not playing is well discussed. 
it's not the solution and as such i will not discuss it. 
why? 
it's a deadend.
