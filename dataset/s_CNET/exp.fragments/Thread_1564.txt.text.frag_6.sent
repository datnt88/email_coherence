the maxblast program that came with it did the rest. 
it changed something in the registry to enable drives greater than 137 gb. i un installed studio9 and tried to reinstall it on the new drive. 
&quot;drv1_vol1(k:)&quot; it told me i could not install in that drive so i had to reinstall in drive c:. i had some video on k: and tried to defragment it. 
i clicked &quot;defragment&quot; and the drive started clicking. 
after about 15 min it was still at 3% complete so i tried to stop the defrag and my computer froze. 
anyone have an idea as to why i can't put pinnacle studio9 on the new drive and why the defragment doesn't work on the new drive? 
i have a feeling the defrag doesn't work because the capturing program is on a different drive.
