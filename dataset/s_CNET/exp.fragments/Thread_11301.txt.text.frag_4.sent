i've read several user reviews stating that the aspire 751 comes installed with a fair amount of bloatware. 
some have said that uninstalling these free and trial apps helped speed up the computer somewhat. 
i don't have time to find the urls to these reviews (go to cnet, amazon, etc.) but they're not difficult to find.
