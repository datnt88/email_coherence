i was going to suggest switching the ports between switches and see if those who were on the other switch started complaining but didn't know if you had a second switch or if located close enough you could do that. 
i'm not sure just moving them around on the same switch will help, but label the lines first and their current hardwire port use before doing it. 
always good to know where you were instead of wondering later.
