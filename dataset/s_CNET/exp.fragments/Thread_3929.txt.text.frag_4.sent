the iphone os doesn't allow you to make changes like this to specific apps, but you can block access to apps rated 17+ (required rating for all apps that access unrateable online content, so apps with leaderboards and things will still work but third party web browsers, facebook, and similar apps won't. 
you can enable theese restrictions by going to settings&gt;general&gt;restrictions&gt;enable restrictions, enter a passcode, then go to apps (at the bottom) and get rid of 17+.
