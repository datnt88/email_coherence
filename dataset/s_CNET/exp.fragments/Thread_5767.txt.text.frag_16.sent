if you don't do 3d rendering and gaming then i suggest you try the 64mb card first. 
im also a graphic artist and from my experience (7 years) i haven't had problem working on a 200mb file using a 128mb vga card, 1 gig of ram with an athlon 3000. 
(although i also use a powermac g4 which has a 256mb vga and 1gig of ram) both perform their task well. 
the manipulation and effects we do with images doesn't tax the gpu much, processing for such will greatly depend on your ram and the cpu. 
and with the specs you have for your new pc i don't think that a higher gpu would give you a noticable boost.
