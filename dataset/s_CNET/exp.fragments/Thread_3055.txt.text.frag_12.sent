based on my experience of using and building computers for over twenty years, i always recommend upgrading to as much ram as you can afford or that your computer will allow. 
it is relatively inexpensive and will provide the biggest noticeable improvement. 
you didn't give to many specifics, but i have seen users of windows xp who are on a dial-up--say aol--and have mcafee virus scan and firewall who's resources drop too low for aol to operate correctly. 
many (not all) of the os's as well as virus scans and firewalls are huge resource eaters. 
in today's computing world, i would not have less than 512ram and you can buy am additional 256ram memory stick for as little as $30.00.
