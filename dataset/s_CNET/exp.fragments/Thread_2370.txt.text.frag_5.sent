read the manual or visit the support website and read about the specs. 
if no mention of any sata ports on your system model#, then you have to buy a sata adapter. 
you add either an adapter to the sata drive itself and become eide capable. 
-or- buy a sata pci type card to install which adds sata ports to install your new drive. 
if possible and you can return the new sata drive for eide type, try that, minus any s/h costs, etc.. tada -----willy
