i'm a novice computer building and i'm trying to update my old dell dimension 4600 (circa 2003). the original system had the following: 2.66 ghz pent 4 512 mb ram 40gb hdd i had added the following during the course of its life span: egeforce 6600 agp, 256 mb 300gb hard disk to help improve its sluggish speed, i recently upgraded the ram from 512mb (2 sticks of 256mb ddr, pc2700) to 2gbs (2 sticks of 1gb ddr, pc2700). 
after installing the ram, i've been encountering numerous problems. 
these problems include the bsod, numerous crashing, tons of win32 errors, and just about all programs closing to due to fatal errors. 
i've run memtest on both sticks of ram together as well as each stick independently for about 2 hours each. 
all the scans revealed indicated the memory was fine. 
i attempted to reinstall windows xp, but it locked up about 3/4 of the way through (after it got to &quot;installing devices&quot;). 
i eventually replaced the old original ram and was able to finish the windows install, but i'm hesitant to add the new ram back. 
does anyone have any insights ito what may be causing all these problems? 
one idea i got from perusing these boards is a lack of power? the power supply in the tower has an output of 250w. 
would this new ram (4x the original) be too much for the supply? 
thank you so much for your help!
