increased system cooling should benefit the whole system. 
while you have 1 hd present, the system case is putting out the heat and &quot;airflow&quot; is key to maintaining a desired level. 
thus, be sure any dust bunnies are cleaned out, the cables/harness is routed well, any possible frt. 
panel filter/inlets are clear and all fans are working now. 
add an extra fan(s) to &quot;exhaust&quot; if empty placement is available. 
check out: for what's out there and others. 
cooling in general is always a plus.
