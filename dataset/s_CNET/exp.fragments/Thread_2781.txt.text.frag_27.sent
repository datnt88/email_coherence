let's see. 
i've built several dozen pc's and good gosh...with no class a cert. 
i guess i should disassemble them all and tell my clients that i am not qualified to work on them. 
this asside, putting a pc together isn't rocket science. 
if a person can read directions, they can put one together. 
then you will know what is going in the unit and will save a bundle even over discount $500 or less deals. 
way back in 1989 when i built my first unit, i was surprised that it pretty much snapped together like a tinker toy. 
in fact i could show a 10 year old how to build one.
