you can have multiple partitions on a raid 0 array just as you can on any single drive. 
your array is seen as one drive anyway. 
as for noticeable difference, i presume you mean speed. 
raid 0 will afford marginally quicker disk access but you don't double your speed by any measure. 
i won't get into the hardware side but you're going to need to be careful about hd selection when creating a raid array by making sure that the disks you buy are approved by the manufacturer for that use. 
otherwise, you raid array is more likely to break.
