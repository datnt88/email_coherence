i sent back the first psu as soon as the technician said it was faulty. 
now i've emailed scan and they replied stating that they would look into replacing parts that were damaged by the psu that i bought from them, but not from dabs. 
they suggested that i contact the manufacturer, antec, about the other parts. 
i really hope antec will replace the parts that their psu ruined, because it was their fault and it's caused a huge inconvenience. 
dabs said that they wouldn't be able to replace any parts, but i've asked if it might be possible to rma them if antec refuse to help. 
unfortunately, the motherboard was from dabs. the technician did try spreading out the load connected to the graphics card, but it didn't make a difference. 
this truly was a terrible recommendation by bit-tech. 
didn't they realise that it would overload with the gtx 670? 
obviously asus anti-surge wasn't fast enough to protect the components. 
i was thinking of building the same pc but with a gigabyte motherboard and the corsair 750w psu (would this be enough for future sli and overlclocking?). but i'm not really sure if they're even good parts; i don't really trust bit-tech very much right now.
