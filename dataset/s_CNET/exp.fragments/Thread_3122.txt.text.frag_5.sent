that makes sense, should i uninstall the usb management program? 
and then just connect the router via ethernet connection? 
what do i have to do with all the addresses that is required? 
and you just blew over me again, how do i configure my router to the dsl? 
hey i appreciate your help if you get me through this i will do anything to repay for your help.
