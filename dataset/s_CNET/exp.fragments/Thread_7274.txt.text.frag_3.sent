those are two things to consider. 
if there's a way for you to test that card in another pc- that would eliminate one variable. 
another possibility would be a conflict with another device. 
go into device manager & see what irq is assigned by going to view&gt;devices by resource. 
sometimes changing slots or even removing the one pci device that's sharing the irq, installing your card, then reinstalling the first device- can get it recognized properly (shutting down & restarting for each).
