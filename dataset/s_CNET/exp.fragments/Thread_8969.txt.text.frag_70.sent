i use win aso for cleaning registry and also do it manually; be careful doing it manually!!! don't know why they can't program a cleaner to delete all the references to programs that you have removed!! just a note , don't use registry cure, it will mess things up. 
and ccleaner!! i only use ccleaner for cleaning my browser history. 
seems to work great for me.
