i've had it running overnight and it is once again performing great! 
even tested it on crysis for over an hour and no freezing and then played some portal 2 and space marine without any issues either. 
thank you to: &quot;vapcmd&quot;, &quot;bob&quot; and &quot;riviversoft&quot; for sticking by me and doing your best to help me out!
