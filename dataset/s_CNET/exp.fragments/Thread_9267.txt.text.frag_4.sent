thank you for the hint, i will try to clean out the dust in my tower. 
i hope that you are right. 
i will start by that. 
can it be that some things in the tower can &quot;tremble&quot; loose due to passing trains? 
with your help i hope that the pc holds it till springtime, the time i hope to have saved enough money to buy a tower with a hard disk with more space than the 20 giga i have now. 
(forgive me my crooked english, i am belgian living now in france and not used anymore to write in english) thank you again.
