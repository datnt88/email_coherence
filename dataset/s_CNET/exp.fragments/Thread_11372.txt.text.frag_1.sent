hi - i am looking to run a cat6 cable from one office to another two via a server cupboard and storage area, a large chunk (30-40m) of this cabling will be outside (in conduit pipes running alongside 240v mains cabling). 
here is a picture of what i propose to do, please ask if anything is unclear. 
i am sure something here must be wrong - i need you to tell me what! 
thanks in advance
