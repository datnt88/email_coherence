one may assume, and im sure the original poster will correct me if im wrong , that when people ask about synching laptops with desktops, what they really mean is they would like to have their laptop look like their desktop- same shortcuts same favorites and most of all their e-mail and documents readily available. 
synctoy will do just that over your home network, i personally use it everyday, for email and for documents- pictures music and other heavy files get done mostly before i travel so i will have the current stuff with me. 
this is the easy way, sure you can go and buy expensive software, sure you can burn discs for backup , those ways are either harder on your pocket or your time when your only talking about backing up one or two pcs.
