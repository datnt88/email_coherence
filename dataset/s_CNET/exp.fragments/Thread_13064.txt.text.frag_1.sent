i have a custom desktop with an intel dx48t2 motherboard. 
in an penny-pinching effort, i decided to go with the motherboard's onboard sound. 
after i downloaded the sound drivers from windows update, i noticed that there was no sound. 
i have also noticed that one of the sound drivers was an hd audio driver. 
does the hd audio driver need special speakers in order to get sound from them? 
my current pc speakers, while still working well, are approx 5 or so years old. 
if it's not a speaker issue, i may just get that soundcard after all.
