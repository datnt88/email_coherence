problem is that there is nothing wrong with the replaced printers. 
in some cases it works fine at another site. 
it's also not a driver issue since we've tried different drivers. 
hp has something about laserjet printers and ups. 
and both manufacturers (hp & tripplite) are saying that is might be the other's fault.
