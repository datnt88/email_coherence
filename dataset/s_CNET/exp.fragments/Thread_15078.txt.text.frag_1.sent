i am looking for a good tv/pc monitor. 
my current one does not have dvi or hdmi ports. 
i currently have a ceton infini 4 digital tuner in my pc. my pc connection to my monitor is rgb. 
i've been told the picture from the tuners would be better quality with a monitor that has a dvi or hdmi port(s). 
my video card has both. 
is this true? 
if it is would someone suggest a good tv/pc monitor. 
i use the tv only at times.
