im planning on having a panasonic th-37ph9uk double as a tv monitor as well as a comp monitor, a ps3 for gaming as well as playing blue-ray movies, and the computer is the last thing i have to decide on. 
sound is my last priority. 
but if i have the cash, ill go for good sound as well. 
si o no in terms of the setup???
