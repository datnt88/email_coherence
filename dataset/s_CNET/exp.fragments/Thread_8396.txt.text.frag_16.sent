aptivaa12-i have been reading all these posts trying to figure this thing out. 
i have taken the monitor apart-and can't really make heads or tails of what i'm seeing. 
(i am not smart in electronics etc)if you do fix monitors-how much would you charge and where do i send it? 
oh? since i have it opened can i send only the boards? 
would that be ok? thank you for your help!
