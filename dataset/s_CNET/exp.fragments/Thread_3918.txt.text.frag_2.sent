80gb hard drive = udma5 = ata/100 = 100mb/second 20gb hard drive = udma2 = ata/33 = 33mb/second other speed factors: - amound of disk cache (512k vs 8mb, larger is better) - rotation speed (4500rpm vs 7200rpm, faster/higher is better) you want the os to be on the fastest hard drive (80gb), on the lowest ide channel (usually labeled channel 0), and as a master. 
use an 80 wire (40 pin) ultra ata cable that is rated for ata/100 or ata/133. 
i'd put the 20gb hd as a slave on whatever channel it likes. 
some older hd's and optical drives don't cooperate in certain positions on the same channel as other drives.
