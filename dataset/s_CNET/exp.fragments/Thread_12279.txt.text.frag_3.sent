the best way to recover the data would be to boot off an live linux cd with just the slave drive installed. 
check out to get a free copy of knoppix that you can burn to cd and boot without using a hard drive. 
once you do that you can just copy any files off the slave to any usb device or through a network share. 
then when you are done you can install windows right onto that slave drive without a format and you will still have your data there *(if everything goes well this is why you use knoppix to make a backup)*
