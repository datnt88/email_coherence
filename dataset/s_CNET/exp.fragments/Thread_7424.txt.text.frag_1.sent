i am looking for a network monitor for a network between a router(ut-300r2u)and 2 computers,because the 2 computers are not in the same room and i want to control,or,if not possible,at least see the bandwidth used by that computer.the 
computers are not connected directly one to each other,each of them is connected at the router(one by ethernet and one by usb).
