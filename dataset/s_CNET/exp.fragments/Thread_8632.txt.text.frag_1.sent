being income tax season and all, i decided when i get mine back any day now, i'm going to use some of it to build a new pc. 
right now i have a prehistoric via computer that runs at 700mhz and can barely do anything without bogging down. 
i don't want a top of the line pc that will cost over a grand and allow me to play crysis with max settings or anything, but something good enough to watch movies and play newer games at medium settings would be great. 
here's what i have so far: cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 5000+ = $100 mobo: biostar tf560 = $70 (after rebate) memory: a-data 4gb ddr2 800 = $80 dvd/cd drive: samsung = $30 hdd: seagate barracuda 250gb = $67 total thus far: $357 so assuming all of this is good and all, i still need a competent video card, a good monitor and maybe a new power supply? 
i have speakers/keyboard/mouse and operating system covered.
