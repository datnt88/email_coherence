thanks for the advice. 
it's a homebuilt computer. 
as far as i can tell there is no easy way to move the hard drives any lower. 
it's an asus p4p800 se motherboard with a p4 1.6 ghz processor and 640 megs (don't ask why) of pc2700 ram. 
everything appears to be running pretty cool except for the hard drives. 
i don't know much about overclocking but if i went with a new case that had a better design for keeping things cool i might end up experimenting a little since i'm not too worried about the hardware other than the hard drives...i'll be upgrading all of it in awhile anyways...if something went wrong that would just accelerate the plans a little. 
i'll look into the other monitoring programs when i get back to my computer.
