running microsoft xp home edition sp2 on an emachines t3958 intel celeron cpu 2.93ghz, 504 mb of ram. 
i have been using this dvd burner for a couple of years with no problems. 
now i've got a problem. 
when i view it under my computer it is listed as a cd drive. 
it will write data and burn dvd's with sonic record now but the dvd's only play on the computer not on a standard dvd player. 
i get disc error when trying to play. 
i use the dvd burner to record home movies. the programs i normally use are super dvd creator and ultra dvd ceator. 
however now when i run those programs the field that shows the recording device is completely blank. 
it used to show _nec dvd_rw nd-3500ag. 
i have avg free version 8 and ran full scan. 
i also ran a deep scan with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
drive still will not work. 
i went to device manager, which says it is working fine, and right-clicked to uninstall drive. 
rebooted and windows automatically detected new hardware to be installed but it was recognized again as a cd drive. 
read on another forum to try xp_cd-dvd-fix by doug knox and it did not help. 
i have had some problems with malware on my computer and something disabled my system restore so i cannot restore to an earlier date. 
i've done everything i can think of and pray that somebody on this forum can help me. 
thanks.
