here's the situation. 
our historical society is publishing a photo-oriented history book using photos from individual's private -- and often family -- collection. 
what i am looking for is a high quality scanner that i can reasonably pack up and take to the contributor's home where i can scan the photos on site. 
specs required for scans: 300 dpi output size: at least 8 inches wide or 16 inches wide for a double spread. 
color mode: grayscale (8-bit) recommendations? 
thanks s
