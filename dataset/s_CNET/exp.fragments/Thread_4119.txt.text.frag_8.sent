i tend to agree with several other posters that the video card is most likely bad. 
i've had three bad video cards in the last 4 years--2 of three were ati based. 
if you have access to another video card or on-board graphics, i recommend you pull the card to see if your system stabilizes. 
hopefully, that will isolate the problem to either your video card or pc. good luck.
