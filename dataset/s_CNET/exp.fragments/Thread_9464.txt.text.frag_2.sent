if you have no other choice, and all can be lost (we all backup the files we can't lose), then try it. 
many of us were surprised (and happy for them) when a similar iffy procedure was tried in the newbies or computer help forum and even though it glitched, the user then flipped over the laptop and got the correct cdkey input and got the machine fixed. 
again, if you are looking for someone to write it should work, it won't be me. 
i know that some hps made the owner create the cds, but some owners didn't. 
i guess they didn't have the time or understand why it was needed.
