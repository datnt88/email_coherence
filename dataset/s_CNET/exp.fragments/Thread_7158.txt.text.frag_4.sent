my computer/properties/system restore and select &quot;settings&quot;. you can't do that? 
i'm not sure if it makes a difference. 
i know that if i unplug a drive and use another usb port for it, windows sees it as a new drive and gives it a different drive letter. 
it also turns on system restore for that drive by default. 
i can't figure why it thinks its a new drive. 
does your bios id the drive? 
if not, i would wonder if windows forgets it saw it once and shuts off sharing.
