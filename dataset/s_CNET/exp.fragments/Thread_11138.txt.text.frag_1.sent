i have used xp pro for years on my toshiba satellite 2800-600 notebook. 
i have never had any problem too difficult for norton system works to resolve --- until about three weeks ago. 
i installed visio 2000 but it would not read a file created on visio 2003, so i tried to install the visio viewer. 
i got myself tied up in knots but eventually i could read the file. 
just after that, i tried to back up my laptop to an external hard drive, which i have successfully done for years. 
after pushing the backup button, the hourglass cursor appeared for about five seconds and then nothing more. 
backup would not load so i was not surprised to find that it did not show up in task manager or the task bar. 
everything else seemed to work fine. 
however, at day's end when i tried to shut down my computer, a dialog box appeared advising that backup was not responding. 
i had to repeatedly hit 'end now' to shut down. 
i also find that playing music from my hard drive now launches real player instead of windows media player. 
i have made the latter my default player but music will only play on real player. 
if i first open windows media player and choose a song, the visuals all work but there is no sound. 
i removed visio 2000 and visio viewer 2003 and then restored my os to a date weeks earlier than the original visio problems. 
these actions have not improved my situation. 
media player still will not produce sound, and i cannot backup. 
everything else seems to be 100%. 
can anyone offer advice, please?
