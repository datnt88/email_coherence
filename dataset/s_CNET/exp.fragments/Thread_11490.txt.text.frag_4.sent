i've seen in actual printout to paper like, customer, retailer, etc. each has large ghost print to id the bill for example. 
in others, i've seen this is displays from websites that show a picture and the website ids the source as from them. 
i would think the flash drive itself would have the pgm. 
build-in as my thinking goes. 
so far, no clue as to a source of such a product, boiler plate does come up, but no reference to a thumb drive.
