has anyone computermemorystore.com to purchase memory before? 
i have ordered, made the payment using paypal and have not heard from them since (this was 6 days ago). the order status give on the website for my order is &quot;on hold&quot;. 
they don't reply to emails, and do not pick up their phone (answering machine)... there is a cnet certified logo on their site, but i can find no reviews on here.. can anyone restore my confidence in them, and make me feel like i will actually receive my stuff from them?? thanks a bunch!
