i entered. 
but it shouldn't make a difference once i've reset the router, should it? 
i am going to try the reset again, and try all the options. 
excuse my networking illiteracy here, but does windows automatically know to try and reach the router address (when i type it in) using the wireless connection, and not my regular internet connection (which is offline)? 
thanks for the replies.
