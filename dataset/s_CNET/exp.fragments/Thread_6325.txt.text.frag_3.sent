i would also suggest you to try internet fax service. 
thus, you'll have all required tools integrated, like: a virtual fax machine, a virtual printer, a fax number, permanent redirection of faxes to one or multiple email addresses. 
personally, i use online faxing from and i am satisfied with it, but there are many other providers.
