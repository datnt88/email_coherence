since it would be surprising that i run your un-named software title i'll have to pass on answering your post. 
however i will share that if i were to do this i'd look for a waas enabled nmea compatible bluetooth gps. 
i wonder what &quot;card&quot; you are asking about. 
i use a variety of 20 or less dollar usb bluetooth dongles in my system.
