using gateway mt6920 laptop with vista home premium. 
i removed the hard drive from a compaq 6470nx pc running windows xp. everything with the installation went well with installation and hookup. 
however i'm not savvy enough to know how to use it. 
i need to know how to transfer stuff to my vista run laptop, step by step. 
vista is still confusing to me. 
i need an explanation that will be understood by a new vista user.
