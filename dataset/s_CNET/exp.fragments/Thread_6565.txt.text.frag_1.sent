trying to rule out power supply and video card , before motherboard. 
i followed instructions in another thread about measuring voltages with the computer on. 
the 12v and 5v rail checked out ok. i was not able to find an aux connector. 
is there a 3v aux with my computer? 
e machines t6420 athlon 64 3400+ here are the symptoms: on a few occasions, my computer would kick into a mode with the fans racing after i walked away for an hour or two. 
(had to hold power button in for 10 seconds to turn off) sometimes the screen saver would be frozen also and i detected sounds. 
i turned off the hibernate mode thinking that might be causing this glitch but it recurred again with the fans racing. the last time this happened i turned the computer back on and the fans stayed in this racing mode and the screen remained black. 
(won't boot} the video is nvidea geforce 6100 and i assume this is built in as there are no other cards. 
could this be why i have no monitor (amber light is on) yet monitor works with my other computer? 
would putting another video card in the open pci slot bypass the built-in video? 
thank you
