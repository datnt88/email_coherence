hi, i have just bought a 400gb freecom external hard drive. 
i plugged it in and it seems to work ok but all my mp3s now sound distorted. 
i thought at first it was just the mp3s i put on the hard drive. 
but infact its all sound played on my computer whether on the freecom, on my internal hard drive, or from the internet. 
has anyone come across this before? 
i think my computer might have usb 1 rather than usb 2 but im not sure how to find out. 
it shouldnt affect the sound either way though should it? 
thanks in advance
