can you recommend configuration? 
i will have dsl next wk for 2 home pcs (winxp) both in same room to be used mainly for music downloads, netsurfing by my 2 teens. 
although pcs will share same dsl line, at this time, there's no need for them to share data and each has own printer. 
if a router is required, what type to buy to avoid the common dropped connection problem? 
money is an issue.
