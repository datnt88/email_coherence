i have 1 gb of memory currently installed. 
i recently caught a nasty bug, removed it, but every time i shut down the pc, i get an error about unable to read memory. 
when my pc boots up, at the dos screen before windows, it reads 512mb memory, but i know there is 1 1024 installed. 
also, windows tells me that 1024/1gb is installed. 
whats going on?. my system info is on my profile.
