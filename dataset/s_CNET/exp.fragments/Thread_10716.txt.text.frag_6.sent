wow you have got to be kidding me. 
there s no way i can do that. 
but she never downloaded the driver. 
i have a patch for something i do not even know how to use it so there is no way i can do it because i have no clue about any of this rebooting by a disc i am sure she doesn't even have the disc for the computer anymore. 
i am mad as h*ll. 
there has to be another way. 
i am not mad at you, you have been very helpful but i am so mad at logitech i can spit. 
and it is too late to call them now.
