ok, now we get down to the nitty gritty. 
i think you will need to reinstall the os and try again. 
something in there is broken. 
using the os x installation disk for 10.3, attempt to boot from it and reinstall the os using the archive and install option. 
you will need to update from 10.3 to 10.9 on completion. 
do you have the disks?
