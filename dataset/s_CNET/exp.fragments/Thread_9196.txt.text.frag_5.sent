the bad news about raid 0 is .... the failure of just one drive will result in all data in an array being lost. 
what you really need to decide is whether continue with raid (i do not recommend this option) or go with a more conventional setup where you can dramatically the reduce the risk of data loss and be better prepared if a drive happens to die.
