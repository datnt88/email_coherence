i have been able to access different pcs that belong to different networks, as long as you know how to get there. 
all you have to do is go into my network places and click on either ''view workgroup pcs'' or ''entire network''. 
with view workgroup pcs option, just click on the ''up'' arrow and you'll see a list of networks, choose one and find the pc. if you go w/ entire network, then microsoft windows network and you'll have a list of networks. 
(this is for windows xp machines). 
the easiest way is to make them be on the same network, but the most important thing is that you have enabled file sharing. 
if this isn't enabled...you won't see squat under the network name. 
the first issue is that you didn't specify your operating systems...this is a very important part of the puzzle. 
so what oss do you have?
