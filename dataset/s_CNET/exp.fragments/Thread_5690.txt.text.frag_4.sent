the actual swapping of p/s units is pretty much straight-foward task. the real problem is a true &quot;physical fit&quot; and same type of connections as that being replaced. 
the connectiosn shouldn't be a big problems, just make sure of the 20-pin or 24-pin main mtrbd. 
connection. 
then some p/s have dual fans or single fan where it directly blows across the cpu, check that. 
if all you plan to do is replace the video card, the oem p/s should do ok, but if not check at this website for power calucations: for the best p/s unit you can buy and a true match/fit look at the (costs$$$) but well worth it. 
last, get the highest wattage unit you can afford, the bigger the better if you plan to further upgrade even more.
