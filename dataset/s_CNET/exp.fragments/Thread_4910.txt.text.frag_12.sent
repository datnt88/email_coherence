mine is about three months old. 
i have four programs installed. 
i don't run games. 
i've noticed the hard drive is very noisy. 
reminds me of the old junk packard bell computers... clickity clickity clickity. 
boot up is slow. 
loading and running programs is slow. 
i removed the annoying bloatware like mcafee antivirus. 
if this is quad core technology, it sucks. 
either that or windows vista is a pain in the butt bloatware itself. 
i do get random rebooting once a week. 
i was surprised at how small the case is. 
i can see how it would overheat. 
the specs on this sound great. 
unfortunately they went cheap with design and components. 
i would not recommend this computer to those who rely on a computer for work (don't know about gaming). 
i paid $1,050.00 because i needed it the same day when my other computer was damaged, but should have built my own.
