&quot;hi, thanks for your response. 
finally this kind of mb does not have the option of usb/firewire in the bios. 
means the bios cannot detect the dvd burner from the firewire port.&quot; there is no question here. 
as to your first post, almost no pcs made will do this. 
it's not a feature of most pcs so nothing busted. 
did you need a history lesson on the personal computer?
