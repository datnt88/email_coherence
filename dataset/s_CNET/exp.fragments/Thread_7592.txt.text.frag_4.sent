since my last post, i'm now using both sticks of ram, and i'm not getting any problems. the problem had been persistent for over a month and now i'm having a stretch of close to 2 days with no troubles since i've been fiddling with the ram. 
i think by reseating them, i might have indirectly cleaned them?
