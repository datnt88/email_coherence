i use several methods to back up my files, which includes data, tons of pictures and a limited amount of music. 
i originally was backing up to a desktop that i set up to function as file server so that my data was in two places. 
then i purchased a wd 250 gig portable hard drive a while back and was primarily backing up to it but then realized that the back up was only as safe as the place that it was kept. the portable harddrive is connected to the file serve and is in the same office where i land after coming in from working in the field. 
the threat of fire or theft made me realize that if either happened i was up you know what creek and it didn't matter about the paddle. 
so i've signed up for carbonite and now back up everything to the hard drive on the file server which that folder is backed up consistentaly to carbonite. 
i then do a monthly or biweekly back up to the portable hard drive. 
recently i've seen a device which is similar to the partable hard drive that comes in 1, 1 1/2, and 2 terabite sizes that acts both as a back up but can also be accessed directly from the internet with proper protections in place from anywhere you have internet access. the networkable device may be my next purchase. 
the increased size and the ability to go online from anywhere and get what i need if i forget it at the office sounds like a great deal fro less than $300.00. 
would love to know if anybody has any experience with a device like this. 
thanks walter in louisiana
