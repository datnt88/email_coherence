i did a check of the flash drive by starting my computer &gt; select drive &gt; properties &gt; tools &gt; error checking. 
it said the drive was ok. but, i'm not sure it is ok, because i can do the same things with another flash drive, and there are much more predictable results. 
does anyone have suggestions about how to thoroughly check a flash drive to verify its condition? 
are there certain software utilities which can be employed, available somewhere on the internet?
