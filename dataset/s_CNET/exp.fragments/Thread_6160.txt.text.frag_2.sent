was that most work but as always the makers can change designs and what i found to work today can stop tomorrow. 
(99% of the stuff works for me) if you need such a thing, write a rfq and submit it to cdw or techdata and demand it be tested before delivery. 
i think it's only a few hundred bucks more for such testing.
