hey laurie, yours is the first post i've come across that describes (almost) the same problem i have. 
i just rebuilt my pc using an asus a7v880 mobo, amd athlonxp 2800+ with 1gb ram. 
i can boot off of the sata drive regardless, but the os (winxp pro) will not see the ide drive. 
it sees any other ide drive attached, but not the hdd. 
i have tried setting it up as master, slave, cable select, primary, secondary...all to no avail. 
did you ever find out what your possible problems could be? 
i can't get these 2 drives to coexist & am wondering what i am doing wrong. 
if you find out any good info, please let me know...thanx! 
regards, robert
