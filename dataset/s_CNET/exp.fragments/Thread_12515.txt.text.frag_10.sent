not knowing how many sound devices you have, how many have proper drivers installed, and how many are working now as opposed to earlier, i'd try to back up and uninstall all drivers for all of them. 
if the pc didn't come this way and devices were added later, it could something to do with the sequence of their installations. 
then, i'd remove the sound blaster card and work with just the on board devices and ports until they are working. 
once that's done, you can install the sound blaster card. 
i've not heard of trying to use two or more sound chips at once. 
perhaps it can be done but it would seem to me there would be conflicts. 
motherboards now come with many more on board components than before. 
some work ok but most have add in devices that work better for some purposes. 
usually if you make a choice to replace an on board device with a card that has more features, you disable the on board device in the bios as a first step.
