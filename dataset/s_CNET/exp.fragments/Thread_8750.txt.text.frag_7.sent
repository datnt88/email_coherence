(i'm quite angry right now because i just finished typing my post then ie froze so thank goodness for safari. 
but i still have to retype the post!!! waaa) i am quite sure i cannot use the p4 prescott 3.4ghz because on the right hand side of this table: it says it is not avaliable for my motherboard. 
i am running the original bios and have never upraded it. the main reason for that is i don't know how but hey!, i can ask cnet. 
so will i have to upgrade by bios to upgrade my cpu? 
i still sort of want to know where i can buy a cpu. 
i am in australia not far from sydney but too far to go just for 1 little cpu. 
there is a computer fair just down the road that that runs every month so i will take a trip down ther when i can. is buying a used cpu alright because i can't get boxed ones any more as intel no longer does this for this cpu an is ebay a good place to buy them? 
if i do find the northwood cpu would i need a new heatsink/fan and would there be a considerable increase of speed if i did upgrade from the celeron 2.1ghz?
