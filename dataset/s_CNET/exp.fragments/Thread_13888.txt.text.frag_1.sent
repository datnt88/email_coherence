i had two 1 gig sticks of ram (i thought was 533mhz but its been at least a year since i got it) and i just bought some upgrades including two 2 gig sticks of corsair 1066mhz ram. 
so that makes a total of 6 gigs and it works great but since all the ram is running at the lowest speed (10% oc brought ram speed up to 293.3mhz stable) from a performance stand point would it be better to have 4 gigs at 1066mhz or the six at 293.3mhz. 
i also use my com for both audio and video production as well as star craft 2 and other games. 
so any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks, spleader visualsonic p.s. cpu-z validation url:
