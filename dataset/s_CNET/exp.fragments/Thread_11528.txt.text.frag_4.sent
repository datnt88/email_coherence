it's my understanding that a particular 802.11 standard may include a lot of features, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they all are implemented in every wireless device. 
an example: if i implement wpa encryption on my wireless router and my wireless network adapter in my computer only supports wep, then i can't connect. 
unfortunately, some adapters don't have firmware updates that add newer abilities, such as wpa or wpa2.
