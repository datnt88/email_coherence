you could make a case against every hardware maker on that area. the days of 7 year support seem to be long gone. 
sun is today your answer for multi-year hardware. 
the downside is that with the current advances those that want 10 year computers are bound to be upset in 2 years as what they bought is now 1/4 the speed of new and maybe 1/2 the price. 
be sure your goals are not conflicting on this area. 
if you jump into intel/amd powered servers (what's a mainframe?) then there is no issue as one box looks like another as you look at what google does for their server farms. 
they wouldn't give sun a call.
