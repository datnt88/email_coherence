i was given a computer with various components installed. 
i was told if i could get it to work i could keep it. the main issue is that it has an ibm 15gb hd that accesses only 2gb. the os is windows melenium. 
i have checked cable connections,jumper settings, and bios settings all to manufacture's reccomendations with no luck. the bios chs settings do not match the reccomended ones and when attempting to change them manually they revert back upon rebooting. 
system info under- storage/disks reports size as 14.32gb and yet i still receive &quot;low disk space&quot; error msgs.
