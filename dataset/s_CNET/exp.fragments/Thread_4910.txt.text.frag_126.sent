had same reboot problem as all gm5478's. 
simple fix. 
i turned off reboot on error in the advanced system settings and it hasn't rebooted in over a year. 
i was instrucked to do so by a tech at best buy where i bought it. 
i still have error reporting set up and also have had no error's in a year.
