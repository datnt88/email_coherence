hear, hear, jon. 
agreed -- if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
i've had to reformat a couple -- three times for reasons known only to god and maybe some pasty-faced programmer in some dark cubby tucked away at microsoft. 
but my xp has been behaving as well, and i wouldn't dream of messing with it. 
now, if i could just get my tungsten palm e2 to resume synching to the expansion card, i'll be one happy computing camper!
