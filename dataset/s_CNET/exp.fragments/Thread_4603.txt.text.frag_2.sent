what os are you using? 
windows 7 has stuff scheduled to run automatically, like disk defragmentation and updates. 
have a look at task scheduler and see if there are things there scheduled to run in the middle of the night. 
also, if you open a command prompt to run as administrator and type in powercfg - lastwake it might tell you what woke your computer (mine always says it doesn't know, but theoretically it should tell you) or if you put in powercfg -waketimers it should tell you what is scheduled to wake your computer up. 
i'm no computer expert, but try googling info about the task scheduler or the powercfg command and it might help you find out what's going on.
