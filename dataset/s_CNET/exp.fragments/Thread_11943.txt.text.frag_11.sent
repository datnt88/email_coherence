having searched for advice regarding this, i have looked at exceptions and found that &quot;file and printer sharing&quot; is ticked, and, in add program &gt; change scope (what a strange choice of words), i have enabled &quot;my network (subset) only&quot;, but upon reurning to this window/tab i find that it is no longer enabled, the setting having reverted to the default &quot;any computer (including those on the internet)&quot;
