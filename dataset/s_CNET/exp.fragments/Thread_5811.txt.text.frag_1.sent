hello everyone! 
i need some advice on what pc to buy, because i don't understand much of a pc's specifications. 
i'm going to mainly use it for games, movies etc. so i want a good and a fast pc. here's the ones i consider buying, but i don't know which one. 
so please, can you please read through the specifications. 
i have compared them all three there: you can press on the green button &quot;marker forskellene&quot; and it will highlight the differences. 
i don't think you really need to understand danish, as it is mostly numbers. 
which one should i go for, to play quality games and movies on great settings. 
intel core or amd? 
which one of the pcs has the greatest graphic card - nvidia geforce or amd radeon? 
can any of those pcs run games like battlefield 3, max payne 3 etc on highest settings? 
please help out. 
i really hope to get some good advices. 
thank you.
