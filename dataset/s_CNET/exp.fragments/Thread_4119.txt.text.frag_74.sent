an ati 3850 does not use much power but it does have power requirements that must be met. 
i have a 4550 by sapphire. 
it requires a minimum of 350 which is all i can supply with he stock from an antec minuet case. 
so start with the power is it stable is it enough? 
you can goto antec.com and use a power calculator an roughly figure out what you need. 
other possible reasons are various from virus to simply overheating. 
scan for virus to start with try different programs the common thinking that the old &quot;one shot cure&quot; fixes everything is not always true. 
if this is good then try installing a small fan just underneath the card if you have room to do so i recommend a pci slot fan that exhausts air as close to the card as you can get. 
although really any low speed fan will do as long as the heatsinks are being cooled. 
if these do not fix the problem it may very well be that the damage is already done and heat has killed the chipset. 
as for buying a card without a fan thats just plain nonsense. 
heat is the number one killer of computer components. 
a cheap quiet fan costs about 10 bucks what did that card cost ya???? so lets see here 3 possibles, virus, overheated, underpowered. 
but its not limited to those 3. a last one i just thought of is the edid coding on your monitor is gone and the card can no longer read this information (this is not recoverable to the monitor) however this would primarily apply if you are plugged into the dvi port. 
to check this goto system devices and check monitors if it says something like this.&quot;generic non_plug and play monitor&quot; then you edid is gone. 
this would also cause monitor to stop functioning all together.
