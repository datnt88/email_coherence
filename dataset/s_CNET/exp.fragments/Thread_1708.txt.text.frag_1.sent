hi, i was playing a game and i noticed that my pc was alot louder than normal so i turned of the pc, cleaned it and during the process i noticed that the graphic card was extremely hot. the next day when i turned on my pc my monitor would not display anything even though the pc light is on and fans too. 
i assumed it might be my monitor so i replaced it with another and it still wouldnt display it. 
i than decided to not attach the monitor cable to the garphic card port but to the additional port located near the other input components and the monitor did work and pc turned on. 
but as u prob know when i did dxdiag my display card was not nvidia but the built in motherboard graphic card which cannot handle playing games like cod/bf even fragments list.s.cnet pre_process.sh 
threads garphic games like wow and league of legends which is not good news for me.i assumed that the graphic card is at fault so my last resort was removing the garphic card and replacing it with my other pc graphic card.the 
pc turned on fine when i did dxdiag it shows the intended garphic card which is nvidia geforce 6200 so i installed it successfully. 
i updated the drivers etc but when i play games or stream/view videos my fps is still the same if not worse(unplayable) so i began to think it might not be the graphic card afterall? 
any help or tips appreciated.these 
specs are with the other pcs graphic card installed, my card which has the problem is nvidia geforce 8800 gts series --------[ everest ultimate edition ]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ version everest v5.50.2100 benchmark module 2.5.292.0 homepage report type report wizard [ trial version ] computer alien-pc generator alien operating system microsoft windows vista home premium 6.0.6002 (vista rtm) date 2012-01-17 time 22:12--------[ summary ]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- computer: computer type acpi x64-based pc operating system microsoft windows vista home premium os service pack [ trial version ] internet explorer 9.0.8112.16421
