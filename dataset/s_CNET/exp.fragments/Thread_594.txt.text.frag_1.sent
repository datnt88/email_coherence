g'day guys i am having some serious dramas with a hard drive which will just not be recognised by another computer. 
the hard drive was a master in the first computer which the motherboard has just died in. the copacitators have started to leak in the motherboard. 
i tried to change the hard drive to another computer and make it a master in that one as well. 
when the computer searches for ide drives in the boot up, it just stops there and doesn't go any further. 
i thought it must have been something to do with the jumpers on it, once i pulled it out there are a whole lot of different settings compared to a normal hard drive, it has both 16 and 15 head options as master, slave and cable select. 
it is a deskstar hard drive. 
if anyone could help me with this it would be apreciated. 
i am worried that if i do buy a new motherboard i will have the same problems and i will then have to buy a new hard drive as well. 
the model of the hard drive is an ibm deskstar ic35l040avvn07-0 if that is any help. 
i have it set as a master on 16 heads. 
cheers.
