you need a &quot;coin box&quot; that generally has some control on printer's own frt. 
panel or similar. 
you must have seen such on devices for whatever but you need to talk to a service provider of such services if they can do this work. 
more than likely its already done, i'm sure some copier center has provided such services. 
of course, ones not humanly handled. 
as often the case here(usa), some decal/sticker is present for service if such a device falters. 
you look in your local telco pages or google for same.
