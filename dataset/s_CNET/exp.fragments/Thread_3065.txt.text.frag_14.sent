on 96 megabytes of system memory, you can run puppy linux, dsl (damn small linux), or virtually any other &quot;featherweight&quot; distributions. 
xubuntu and zenwalk use a little too much memory to work, unfortunately, but if you can bring it up to at least 192 megabytes of ram you'll be able to run either of these systems. 
they will give your friend a much much better experience than the featherweight distributions. 
note: if you decide to do the latter and use zenwalk, make sure you download the full version, not the core; and if you decide to use xubuntu you should download the alternate install disc (not the desktop cd).
