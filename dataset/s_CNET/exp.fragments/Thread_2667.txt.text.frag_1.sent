earlier today as i left my computer running in my room my child began to explore my work area. 
at first i was okay with it but suddenly hear a popping sound there. 
i turn around to see that my child had taken the smaller end of a usb cord and stuck it into the operating end of a nearby power socket. 
the buzzing stopped as the breaker tripped, but the end of the cord was charred and burnt. 
my computer doesn't seem to be showing any signs of damage, but i am afraid to use it. 
i am using my laptop to type this; would my computer suffer damage? 
if so, how bad would it be?
