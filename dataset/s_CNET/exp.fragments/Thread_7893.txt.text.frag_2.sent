i wouldn't advise upgrading your pc. rdram is obsolete and expensive compared to ddr/ddr2. 
likewise, your cpu and motherboard chipset are dead-ends. 
vista will be by february and if you buy a dell pc after october you'll get a free/cheap upgrade to vista when it releases. 
even if you have to buy vista at full price, it will be cheaper than the cash you'd throw away on upgrading your current pc. so just a wait a month or so and get a new system.
