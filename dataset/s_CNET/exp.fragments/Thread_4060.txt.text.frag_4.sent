you are right - i have had the pc for 4 years. 
but i added the dvd rw and second hard disk few days ago. the shop assistant asked me whether i wanted a 400w psu also. 
i declined as i have already changed the original 200w psu to a new one (250w p4 ready)10 months ago. 
some people tell you 250watts is enough others insist on something more powerful! 
i just don't want to spend money on something not useful. 
thanks for your added input.
