i am in serious need of a new computer and saw the hp in the circuit city circular this past weekend. the computer seems to have everything i'm looking for, for what i'll be doing on it. 
(i'm not a big gamer). 
what i find most interesting is the lcd moniter comes with it - 19'', not too shabby. 
here's my question...it says i can watch tv on it. 
i've asked around and gotten no real answers on this. 
can i watch this like a regular tv? is it going to show as full screen or just a pop-up window i have to maximize? 
would i just be better off getting a tower and hooking it up to one of my other flat screen tv's? 
anyone with any information on the media center bundle, please let me know the real story on it. 
thanks in adavnce!
