you want to avoid a amplifier. 
they tend to increase the noise and the signal. 
sometime it will actually work worse. 
the cheapest route if you can do it is to replace the antennas on the router. 
it will help a small amount but you will still have the small antenna on the user side in most cases. 
there are devices called wireless extenders that will take the signal from the router and rebuild and retransmit it as opposed to a amplifier than just increases the power. 
these to a point work but you now have 2 radio links that can get interference. 
with all the isp installing wireless in everyones house lately it is very hard to get any distance because everyone is stomping on each other.
