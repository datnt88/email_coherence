i'm installing a new motherboard and processor - asus a7v8x-x with amp 2500 xp. i've inserted the motherboard, connected the processor/heatsink/fan, conncted drives and pci boards. 
last i connected all of the power cables and pin connectors. 
when i try to start the machine everything lights up but the cpu fan doesn't start, so i switched it off immediately. 
any idea why the fan wouldn't work? 
i tested the fan in a different machine and it works fine. 
i also tried a good fan in the macjine but it didn't work. 
thanks gary
