hi, i'm having a issue with nat settings and was hoping you guys could help. 
i have a linksys e3000 wireless n router. 
i have two xboxes connected to the router, one wired, and one wireless. 
i'm trying to get both of the xboxes to have an open nat, but i haven't had any luck. 
i spoke with a cisco tech, and they had me do &quot;port range triggering&quot; for 80 and 3074, change mtu to 1364, uncheck &quot;filter anonymous requests&quot;, and disable &quot;upnp&quot;. the best it would ever do is make the wired xbox open, and the wireless one moderate. 
but it seemed intermittent, and sometimes the wireless xbox would change to strict. 
could you guys maybe give me a hand? 
thanks!
