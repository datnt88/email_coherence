re the 12v ....12.17v reading is fine. 
i am running 4 hdd's and i asked the computer technicians to make it into 2 or 3 i think this is possible am i correct or do i have to reinstall the os again? 
are you running raid ? 
when i was going through the bios settings i found out the drams performance was set on turbo so it was being overclocked for all this time, i switched it back to standard so i think there is more stabillity now then before. 
could this be the problem? 
if it's running more reliably with ram turbo off ... leave it off. 
are you sure the cpu is running at the design speed ?
