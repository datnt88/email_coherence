&quot; simple question. 
will a p3 handle a 160 gig harddrive?&quot; 
yes. 
p3's can do that, but the bios must have been updated. 
but a bios is not a p3. a &quot;p3&quot; is just the cpu of the machine and this cpu is not limited in this respect. 
there is an end run around a bios with a limited support and that is to put the drive in an usb 2.0 enclosure and use a compatible os. also, the os is an issue... bob
