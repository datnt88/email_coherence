i have an alienware area-51 3500 that i got back in 2006, although it's taken so many upgrades it's practically not the same machine. 
as of now, it houses a gigabyte ga-ep45-ds3r motherboard, intel core2 duo e8400, 4 gb of ddr2-800 crucial ballistix tracer ram, gigabyte geforce 8600gt graphics card, 2x 80 gb hard drives, dvd rw drive, lg blu-ray and hd-dvd drive. 
i use a 500 gb external drive for all my &quot;stuff&quot; so if i have problems, reformatting is easy, although i'm highly sick of it and probably won't do so again for a while.
