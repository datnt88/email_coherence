hello, i just bought a belkin wireless router with adsl modem and a usb network adaptor. 
i have set up the router but for some reason i can only pick up a very weak signal...even though the router is around 15 metres from the computer (router has a range of 1500ft) could it be the usb network adaptor to blame? 
would an internal pci card pick up the signal better? 
also the router is near a cordless phone but the phone operates at 1.9ghz and the router at 2.4ghz so this should not be much of a problem should it? 
please help.
