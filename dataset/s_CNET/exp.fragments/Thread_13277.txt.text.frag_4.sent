barry, web site is a guide to partitioning. the number of partitions mentioned seems strange. 
what are the sizes of the partitions? 
as mention in the other posts cut/paste your files to the other partitions. 
displine yourself to place files and downloads on any partition other than c. remember that h/d are prone to fail. 
keep your data backed up.
