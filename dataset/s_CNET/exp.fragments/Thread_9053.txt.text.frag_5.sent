thanks guys, i just i installed nero 9 reloaded. 
i did try renameing the file but did not work for window's movie maker so the intro song would play all the way thru. 
sorry for the lame ??'s, but do appreciate people like you that take the time to help others and i'm learning until we meet again and hope not to soon. 
again super thanks!!
