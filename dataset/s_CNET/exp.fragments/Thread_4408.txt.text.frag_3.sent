thank you for your quick reply. 
i am connecting for browser access. 
it is going to my raspberry pi that i have running raspbmc (xbmc). 
i have tried using different ports because like you said they block access certain ports. 
i wonder why i am able to connect within my network using my external ip though, that seems strange to me.
