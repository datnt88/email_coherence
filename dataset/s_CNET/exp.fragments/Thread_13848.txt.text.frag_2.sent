if the site is designed for say an 800 x 600 resolution and you have say a 1440 x 900 resolution(widescreen) then you may have some margin space on some sites that hard code how wide the page is, like cnet here but also others. 
some windows can be resized and very few sites i'd imagine allow you to tell the computer what size your window is to allow all of it to be used. 
so in short, unless you like low resolutions and enjoy those pains, there isn't a solution for you.
