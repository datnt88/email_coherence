i'm wanting to add 1gb in addition to my current 512mb ram in my desktop...but my computer only has 2 slots for ram and both are filled with 256mb dimms. is there something &quot;out there&quot; that can combine both dimms into one dimm slot so that i can add the additional 1gb i want into the other dimm slot? 
by the way, my memory is the pc2100 kind.
