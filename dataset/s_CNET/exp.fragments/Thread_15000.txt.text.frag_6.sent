ok, so here are some more specs on this pc, which i'm actually using (in safe mode). 
windows vista 32bit, sp2 intel core2 cpu 4300 1.8ghz, 501mb ram intel gma 950 dynamic video memory technology 3.0 it seems to only boot properly when the power is completely cut from the system. 
then when it does boot it is incredibly slow, so slow that it took about 15 minutes to completely boot, and nearly 20 to shut down (this is out of safe mode). 
as for the possibility of it being the video card, i'm not so sure it really is. 
seeing as there is never an issue with display when it does boot correctly. 
the colors aren't off, the image isn't blurry, it runs as if there are no issues. 
is there anyway to test the motherboard for issues?
