while the above may or may not resolve it, i suggest tossing out xp's native recording which you can also read more at that &quot;some cds burned by win xp cannot be read. 
microsoft has acknowledged various problems with the inbuilt software that can result in files (or sometimes whole disks) being unreadable when they have been burned with the inbuilt software. 
see mskb 320174. 
they have posted a patch on the microsoft download center...&quot; i'd use cdburnerxp from download.com and let microsoft keep their problems.
