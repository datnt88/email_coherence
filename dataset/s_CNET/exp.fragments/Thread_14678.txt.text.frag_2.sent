depending on the rest of her setup, you don't need the printer brands hardware. 
she will need a wireless network card....either mini pci if available or using an available add in slot (pcmcia types). 
something with 802.11 b/g should be fine. 
these can be bought for under $50. 
wireless print servers come in parallel and usb types and tend to run about $80 and up though bargains can be found. 
if this is within your price range, options are many.
