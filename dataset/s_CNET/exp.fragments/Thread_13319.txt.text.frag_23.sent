i watched steve job's presentation again on my mac early this morning from 2am until 3am utilizing apple quicktime pro (full image screen.) i was very impressed with the graphics presentation. 
(i happen to be a graphics person, not a tech.) the amazing speed of the intel processor and above all the ability to still be able to use all my present software with the macintel is amazing. 
it was so late to view this video that i cannot remember the name of the software that would bridge say, adobe photoshop with the new processor. 
adobe photoshop would be able to work on the new mactels as i understand. 
peter, what is that software called?? as far as purchasing a new macintel and concerns? 
as i have posted before, really not even knowing about this new hybrid, mac and intel have been working on this project, their engineering departments have ironed it out i am sure. 
good guess on my part. it works!!! this is not a windows intel processor. 
this is a brand new mac intel processor from scratch. 
designed from the ground up by the engineers from mac and intel. 
things that i also like is all the great new software that has been designed for the beginner as well as the pro. 
seemless professionalism on a presentation. the list goes on. 
more to come from microsoft office suite and a host of others that are impressed. 
this will be the single most important step for mac ever in its history. 
i am excited about the future of the mac. 
i am a mac user and probably can afford to send a mac to my son, who is a pc user presently in turkey. 
most likely would get it down pat in less than a week. 
my son speaks seven languages fluently, and presently working toward learning his eighth language. 
mac? 
piece of cake! 
what say you?? what about pc users? 
wait, or jump on now! 
thanks, -kevin
