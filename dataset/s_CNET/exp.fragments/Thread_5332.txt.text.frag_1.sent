i was at office max yesterday and saw two routers on sale. 
they appeared to be exactly the same router, except that one was &quot;draft&quot; n and the other was just &quot;n&quot;. the draft n was about $20 bucks cheaper. 
i live far out in the country and the beavers and turkeys out here are of the non laptop carrying types, so i really have no need for security and encryption, but i do have a tremendous need for range. is there anyhting to fear from the draft n vs. n? i think both were dlink routers.
