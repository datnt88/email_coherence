lol. i didn't reply about the p2p because i didn't know how to reply. 
i haven't even read that link yet. 
i don't really know what that is. 
so i guess i should take my laptop out and see if it connects to other wireless networks and how strong the connection. 
it has to be my card or inteference in my apartment. 
how would you know if the manufacturer did not plug in the antenna?
