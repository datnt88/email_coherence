hi, i wanna get a usb tv turner that can turn my laptop into a hdtv. 
there are quite a lot of them at newegg.com, such as hauppauge, plextor. 
can anyone suggest what to buy? 
what is most important to me is that it has to enable subtitle, because i need to record some tv dramas and study american english through the subtitles. 
most of time i may use it with the cable tv signal, so the plug is what i concern. 
i notice that the plug is different between canada and the u.s. if i want to make it work for both places, what kind of adapter should i get? the portablity is also my concern because i travel. 
so i think usb models are better than those bigger ones. 
regarding the antenna, i heard people saying that the antenna that comes within the package is useless, or not very effective. 
i do have a old antenna that belong to my old analogue tv. the two sticks can stretch out very long. 
can it be of any help to get signals over the air while i am at travel? 
best! 
dong
