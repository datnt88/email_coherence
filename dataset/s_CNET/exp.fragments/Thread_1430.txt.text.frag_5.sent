i tried everything and seem to have a compatibility problem. 
i wind up with a 5 asc: 30 ascq: 0 error which, when researched, appears to indicate some sort of compatibility problem. 
i suspect my philips cdd5301 needs replacement. 
any final thoughts on other troubleshooting techniques or resources for resolution? 
ps. the link referred me to the same troubleshooting i tried earlier and the new s/w doesn't solve the problem either. 
thanks!
