we don't know what your header looks like. 
often it's two rows of pins with 5 in one row and 4 in the other. the odd pins don't much matter. 
it should be easy enough to find the +5v & the ground. 
they should be on opposite sides of 4 pin row and will those will match the corresponding pins in the row parallel to it. the pins in between should be the data+ and data-. 
data- should be next to the +5v pin. 
so in sequence you have +5v, data-, data+ and ground.
