&quot;to test the ability to access data during a drive failure, we started a video from drobo and proceeded to extract one of the hard drives and replace it with another (a 400gb hitachi deskstar). 
we didn't see any hiccups in the video (or any of the other files we accessed), and the formatting of the new disk and the rewriting of the data progressed in the background.&quot; 
sounds good to me.
