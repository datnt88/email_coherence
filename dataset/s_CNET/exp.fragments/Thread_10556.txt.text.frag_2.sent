i personally have an i5-2430 cpu with 8 gb of ram. 
i run with 22 web sites, my windows live mail, and spider solitaire, wordpad, and occasionally word and windows explorer open and am currently using only 49% of my ram. it depends on what you're using the computer for though; video editing and complex games can take a lot more resource. 
i never have a slowdown since i upgraded from 4 to 8 gb, but i don't do video editing or play games more complex than spider solitaire. 
if you have too little ram, you'll really see slowdowns, but a too slow cpu can be a pain too. 
i rarely see my cpu get over 40% busy, but there are occasional spikes into the 80s and 90s. 
good luck.
