if i do get the xfx geforce 8800 gs, what would be the reccommended psu wattage as i just purchased a new 450w psu. 
im running: 2 intel pentium 4 3ghz 2 1gb sticks ddr ram 1 sata hdd 1 combo dvdrw/cdrw odd 1 cdrw odd 1 cpu fan 1 system fan 4 usb devices powered from pc. ive used a few psu wattage calcs but alot dont have the 8800gs as an option for the gpu. is 450w sufficient?
