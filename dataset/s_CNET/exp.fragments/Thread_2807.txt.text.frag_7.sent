hi bob, i made the dvds using freemake video converter, i opened freemake, choose video at the top and browsed to the desired movie file. 
i then clicked to dvd and choose settings pal and burn to disk when finished converting. 
they all converted then burnt to the dvd-rs and as far as i could see the disks where finalized. 
so the problem is freemake? 
not correctly burning the disks? 
although they do play on the xbox and dvd player. 
thanks!
