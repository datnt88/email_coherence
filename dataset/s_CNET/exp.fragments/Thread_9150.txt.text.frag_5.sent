was the nvidia geforce 7500le card an integrated one? 
was it a better card than the integrated 950 i have now? 
i'm wondering because i returned my system, because of typing issues and monitor distortions (split screen, horizontal lines). 
all of which i tried to resolve through the appropriate channels first, before ending up returning the system, and had zero success with any resolutions. 
when i went back, there was a $300 price differnce from $1299 with the geforce 7500le to $999 with the intel integrated 950. 
and the model # was different (a6077c vs a6157c). 
i figured it was because the graphics card was different. 
was the savings though in my best interest or was i robbed and should i have stayed with the geforce 7500le? 
can i add a dedicated graphics card in the future if i step up to any gaming?
