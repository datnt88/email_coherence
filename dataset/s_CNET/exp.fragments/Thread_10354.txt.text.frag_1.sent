i am needing to purchase a hard drive enclosure. 
my drive will be the western digital caviar se16, 250gb, 7200rpm, sata ii, 3.5''. 
i am thinking of getting the addonics ae5sacsuf. 
their website is &lt; &gt;. 
this enclosure has a oxford 911 chipset. 
1.) has anyone used the enlosure above?(if 
you have see questions 2, 3, 4, and 5). 
2.) does it heat up? 
3.) does the drive stay in tight? 
4.) does it have any heat problems? 
5.) is the enclosure loud/noisy? 
6.) has anyone tried macally enclosure? 
they have a new sata ii enclosure with no fan. 
7.) in the specification of some enclosure, it says it is aluminum so no fan is needed. 
any opinions/facts? 
do i need a fan for the drive i'm getting even though it states in the drives's description that it has cool and quiet operation? 
8.) any opinions on kingwin night hawk enclosures? 
9.)any recommendation on a brand name enclosure that has sata i and ii, a fan, quiet, fast, good chipset?
