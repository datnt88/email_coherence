hi bob - i went in and unchecked the uac and rebooted. 
it didn't seem to make a difference. 
when clicking configuration the printer's usb port i now get an error message that says: &quot;an error occurred during port configuration. 
this operation is not supported.&quot; was there anything else you thought to do after disabling the uac? 
thanks again for your time.
