i suggest you try google do it yourself sites to help you choose the hardware you seek. 
myself, i've never boight a prebuilt of custom built unit from anyone, i build all my own. 
look around your local electronics parts supplier and see what they have. 
you need to decide what you want to do with the unit as that wil dictate the parts you need. 
most book stores will have a large selection of books to help you too. 
my first suggestion is that whatever chassis you buy, replace the metal standoffs that the motherboard mounts on with plastic or nylon ones to prevent shorting of the power supply which is the number one cause of failure in all the self built units i've serviced.
