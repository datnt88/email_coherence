good points. 
i left the chip for last and it looks like i'll have to increase my budget by about 300 bucks in order to get a p4 650 3.4. 
the graphics card will have to stay in the 256 range for the time being. 
i'm also mainly going to be doing video editing on this system. 
any other suggestions with this in mind? 
pci slots could be an issue at some point as well in the future. 
i guess a new mobo in a couple years would fix that.
