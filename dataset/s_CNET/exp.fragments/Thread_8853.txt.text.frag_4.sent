i was thinking of going with a pinnacle systems studio av/dv version 9 video editing kit, because the salesperson told me the dazzle and this are pretty much the same except one is internal and one is on usb. 
or... i was thinking about getting a tv tuner, because the tv tuner would kinda be an added bonus that i might use in the future - although the salesperson told me that the quality may not be as good. 
i was thinking of getting either a hauppauge usb 2.0, or a hauppauge pvr-250 tv tuner. 
what would be better? 
one last thing, for the pinnacle card, there is 256 mb video memory listed, is this a typo? 
because i've never seen video memory on a card of that category.
