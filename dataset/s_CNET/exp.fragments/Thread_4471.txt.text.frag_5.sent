by the way, i have the asus p5ad2 premium mobo. 
with the intel p4 processor 540/1gig of ddr2 ram/160gb. 
sata hd/etc... i have nothing plugged into my usb ports since none of them are working. 
as far as my bios is concern, i have upgrade it as far as it will go. 
my drivers are all up to date. 
i just never thought about using my usb ports until now.
