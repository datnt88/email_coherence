are all of your ram sticks the same voltage/speed/timings? 
boot into your bios with 2 sticks and manually configure the ram to run at ddr2-667 (or use fail-safe settings). 
save those settings and shutdown the pc. install the additional 2 sticks and try to boot. 
if it boots fine, then manually set the timings for ddr2-800 at cl 5-5-5-18 and try again. 
if it still only boots with 2 sticks at ddr2-667, then you probably have a compatibility issue and would need to replace the other two sticks.
