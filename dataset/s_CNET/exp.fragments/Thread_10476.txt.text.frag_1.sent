i just bought a maxtor onetouch 4 plus (external harddrive) for my ibook g4. i'm running osx 10.4.l0, and the drive mounts fine, and i can drag files on to it and everything. 
however, the one-touch feature does not seem to work. 
maxtor manager opens, but when i click &quot;backup now&quot;, nothing happens. 
how can i fix this?
