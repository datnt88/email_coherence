if i backup my toshiba satellite l305-s5885 laptop 250gb hard drive to an external 250gb hard drive and then restore my laptop hard drive back to day 1 (brand new status), can i selectively put files back on the restored hard drive? 
so i can get rid of unnecessary files. the reason for the restore is an error message that i get every time i reboot my laptop that requires me to put the windows disk in the cd drive which came with the laptop which i bought brand new. 
i'm hoping to eliminate this error message and &quot;spring clean&quot; my computer's hard drive.
