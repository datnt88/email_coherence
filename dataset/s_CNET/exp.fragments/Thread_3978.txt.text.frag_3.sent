steven, thank you for the reply. 
i have tested it on another computer and it shows the same distorted picture. 
also, i tried another monitor on my computer and it is totally fine. 
any suggestions from here? 
i just wish that i could just press a button and reset the damn thing. 
thanks for the input...
