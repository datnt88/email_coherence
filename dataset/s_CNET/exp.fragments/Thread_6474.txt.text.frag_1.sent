i have set a wi-fi network with a desktop pc and a laptop. 
both running on xp. i have a printer connected to the laptop and need to be able to print on it from the desktop pc. both computers are on and running. 
when i try to go through the add a printer wizard it goes as far as recognizing the printer connected to the laptop. 
it gives me the name of the laptop and the name of the printer. 
so i choose it and click on it. 
this is where i hit a stumbling block. 
a frame comes on that tells me is connecting to &quot;name of the laptop&quot; and asks for a user name and a password. 
i have tried the user name and password for the laptop; it simply tells me access denied. 
i have tried as administrator. 
i have tried too the user name and password of the pc. all instances same result. 
i made sure the share a printer on the laptop printer is enabled. 
any suggestions to solve this problem will be appreciated.
