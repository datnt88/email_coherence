i have an external usb/firewire hd installed. 
if i leave my minicruz flash drive plugged in during a re-boot, windows (98se) changes the drive letter on my external hd. if i remove the flash drive, reboot, it corrects the problem. is there a way to lock the drive letter on the external hd so this stops happening?
