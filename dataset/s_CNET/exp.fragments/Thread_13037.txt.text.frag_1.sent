hi all, think this is probably my first ever post here. 
anyways, my matter is as follows: i do a lot of scientific computing on my desktop, runing r or occasionally matlab codes. the programmes run for several hours typically. 
the calculation is mostly simple +-*/^, just that the number of iterations is usually very very large. 
and quite often, i work with high dimension matrices. 
as my old dell desktop is dying, i am starting to plan next work station and i would love to build one by myself. 
my key question is which specification should i be after? is it a fast cpu? 
lots of memory? 
l2 cache? 
i don't really have a clue. 
don't know if this is feasible at all, but i have a budge round 500 (or $800) for mobo/cpu/memory/case/psu. 
thanks a lot!
