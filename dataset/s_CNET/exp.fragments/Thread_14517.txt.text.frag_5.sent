i'm not the one building this computer, i'm just posting questions since the builder can't. 
(obviously) is there a good guide that will take us through installing a hard drive, including both physical installation and partitioning and formatting the drive? 
i would like to go back and double check that everything has been done correctly up to this point. 
if possible, i would like a guide that goes into detail about some problems we might encounter (like the current one) as well. 
thanks again.
