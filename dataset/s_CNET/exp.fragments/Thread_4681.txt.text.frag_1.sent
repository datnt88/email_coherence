my comp is not a gaming rig, not even close to being one. 
i can still play some games but at a slow framerate pase. 
what i want to know is. 
when you lower the resolution in the game, it shows improvement in every aspect except picture quality, but on mine if i lower the resolution in windows and the game is shows dramatic improvement. 
is this just a thing in my head or does this happen in everyone elses comps? 
when computers get tested for benchemarks frame rates do they do this or what?
