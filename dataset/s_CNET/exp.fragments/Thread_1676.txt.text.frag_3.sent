i have an asus a8n-sli deluxe with an amd64 x2 4800+ a new cpu will drop into the socket but may not work at all, may work partially but not ever show the correct cpu info or may work as it should in any pc with a correct bios. 
see if you can find if compaq made a version of your system with an athlon cpu and check for the bios updates.
