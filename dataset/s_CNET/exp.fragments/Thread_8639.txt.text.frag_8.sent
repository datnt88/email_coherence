yay by using getdataback, i recovered most of my files onto my laptop even though they gave lots of bad sector errors. 
i had alerady recovered my windows partition so i booted into it and continued, my hope lost for the complete recovery of my data partition. 
i tried testdisk once again. 
and ta-da it got recovered! 
i think testdisk is the best application out there for data recovery because it is powerful, small and fast. 
thank you for your help! 
btw i dont think i would be able to get that kind of hdd for under 99bucks over here. 
i dont live in the usa where the demand and competition is high.
