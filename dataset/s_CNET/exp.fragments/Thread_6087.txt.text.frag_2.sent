firstly the processor does not lend itself to being much for gaming. 
by the time you get done doing any upgrades to that system, you may as well have purchased (or built) another system with better capabilities. 
all i would do would be to pump up the memory and install a video card, of course if you could find a more substantial psu that would be a plus. 
but the celeron processors are noted for being wobbly when it comes to anything tricky. 
shop around, you may be able to do your component upgrades for close to your 150.00 budget. 
good luck!!
