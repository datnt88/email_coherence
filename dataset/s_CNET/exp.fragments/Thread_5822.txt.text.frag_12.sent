penryn is the last revision of the core2 architecture. 
when intel releases its next-gen nehalem cpus in late 2009, they will require a new motherboard since the processors will use a different socket. 
so, every current intel mobo will become more/less obsolete in 2009. the new nehalem will have integrated memory controllers and should debut in the 3+ghz range for quad and should also have sex(y) (6) and octo (8) cores. 
they should run circles around penryns like conroes ran circles around pentium ds.
