i was hoping this was the fix, but it didn't help. 
with the wrt54g router the problem is just terrible, as it was with the smc router. 
with a non wireless router the problem doesn't occur as often, but still happens every few hours. the thing is, it pops up in the lower right corner saying &quot;network cable disconnected. 
it also occurs to two other systems that are connected with a wire, it's not as if there was just spyware in one system causing it.
