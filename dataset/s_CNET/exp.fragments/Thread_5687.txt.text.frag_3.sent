32 x burning is actually too fast to be burning most items that may require low error rates. 
it has been written in a number of columns that the maximum you should be burning at is 24-32x as beyond that will cause increased errors as well you should be burning in disc at once for music. 
now the other thing that will affect your burning rates are the software you are using if your using a demo version of say nero or roxio they will after the trial limit the burning speed that can be attained. 
if youa re using an older version of burning software you may need to upgrade the software. 
one other thing to make sure of is that the discs that you purchase are capable of handling and recommended for the speed of your burner. 
i personally burn nothing over 24-32x depending on what i am burning and if i am really mission critical i will burn at 4x for some things. 
i can wait the extra minute it may take, if it means one less coffee coaster. 
always remember fast is not always good.
