im stuck between the 7900 cards and the new 8800's. 
i have a legit copy of windoes xp laying around, from which i will built my system with. 
i dont plan on upgrading to vista. 
so if the dx10 doesnt work with windoes xp then i dont want to waste my money on a dx10 card, ill go for a 7900 sli instead. 
thx in advance.
