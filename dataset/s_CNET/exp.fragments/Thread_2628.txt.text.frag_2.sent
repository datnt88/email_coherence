there's e-bay, but in your post you didn't raise the issue that you may want the battery to hold a charge... then, in a pinch i did find a battery rebuilder. 
it was for a model that i couldn't buy a battery for, so the 70 bucks was worth it. 
in closing, your part of the world may not be like mine, so my lowest cost won't be yours. 
so it's up to you to search for such things in your neck of the woods.
