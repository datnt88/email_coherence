thank you ozos. 
i have not changed any jumper or any other settings on the bios as far as i know. 
&lt;p&gt; the only recent change to the pc was the addition of one of those optical mouses with all kinds of lights inside. 
maybe the extra power demand is causing a problem? 
&lt;p&gt; flashing the bios is a good sugesstion though. 
i will start there by checking to see if there is an update available from asus.
