well my new pc came with a brandless psu, i never leave it on for more than a day, usually around 10 hours max i would turn it off, but i need to download something important and i need to leave it on for possibily long periods of time, something like 30 hours, so my question is: -with the bad psu on my pc, will leaving it on for 30 hours be a bad idea? 
luckily my pc isn't boiling....yet, and i already left it on for 12 hours, however i still need 30 more hours before i can turn it off, and i really don't want to turn it off unless i have no choice, i don't want 56k in the first place but broadband require signing a 1 year contract.... so please, give me some advice, thanks.
