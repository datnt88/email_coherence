i would like to upgrade my video card from my nvidia geforce fx5200. 
what would be a reasonable nvidia uprade for my system in the $100-$150 range? 
i am concerned about compatability and cooling. 
system: pentium 4 3.2ghz, 3 gig ram, motherboard intel d865glc. 
i am unsure of wattage of power supply.
