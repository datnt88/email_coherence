i have posted this problem in the &quot;hardware&quot; forum, but perhaps it belongs here (?). i have an ibm netvista 6578pau w/ pentium iii, 866mhz chip, win98se, 256mb ram, intel 815 chipset video bi, 17&quot; sylvania cl772 lcd monitor w/vesa ddc (digital display channel). 
apparently, the vesa ddc will not allow anything other than a 480 x 600 display w/16 colors. 
i downloaded a new driver from the proview.com 
website, but the closest one they had was for a 713/716 & it does nothing for my problem. 
any ideas?
