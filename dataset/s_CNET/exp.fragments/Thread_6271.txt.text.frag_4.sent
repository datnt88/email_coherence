the other downside is the cost. 
being a niche product you pay a premium. 
if you just want a second display, a common monitor is the cheap fix. 
almost all laptops will do a dual display. the wallet is usually the decider here. 
for me, i'd give usb 3.0 displays a wide berth since drivers are still iffy. 
you don't want to know the stories.
