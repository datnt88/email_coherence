i have an internet connection that enters my house using a cat5 cable through rj45 type socket - currently i have a desktop that is connected to the cable - i want to share my internet connection - the desktop should have a cable connection and want to connect a laptop as well which will connect using wireless as well as cable as and when required - i will not be using both computers at all times so do not want to make my desktop a server or the laptop a server - so how do i share the connection - i mean do i use a wireless router, switch or something else ? 
and then how do i set it up - i have no experience or education in networking so i would really appreciate it if you could tell me in detail. 
thanks for your help.
