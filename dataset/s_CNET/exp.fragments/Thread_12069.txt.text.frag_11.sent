i found something on my computer's spec sheet: under &quot;storage&quot; it shows (from what i can gather) that it can indeed support 2 tb drives, but only ones that run at 5400 rpm (for some reason). 
it can support 160/250/320/500/640/750/1000 gb drives at 7200 rpm, but over 1 tb... it needs it to slow down. 
and wouldn't you know it, i got myself a 7200 rpm 2 tb... i honestly don't know if that's something you can change with bios updates, it sounds frustratingly final.
