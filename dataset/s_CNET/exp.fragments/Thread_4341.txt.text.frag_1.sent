i have finally got a hold of the mobo that i ordered from newegg.com. 
it was quite easy to put in, thanks to ray's heads up regarding the jumpers. 
but i have problems already. the new mb is a pc chips' product, and its model # is m811lu. 
i have put in everything onto the mb and into the new case without any problem. 
and the mb recognizes every components quite easily. 
but then problem came up, when i plug the ethernet cord into the rj 45 jack, the screen went to the good old &quot;white text with blue background&quot; telling me either the hardware does not have the latest driver or it's not installed properly. 
though every card in the pci slots were found and installed properly, and i am certain they all have the newest driver. 
i have double checked over and over again, still no luck. 
at first i thought it's just the on board lan's not acting correctly, therefore, i disabled it and put in my own nic. 
still, same blue screen with white text appeared when i plugged in the ethernet cable. 
can someone please help me verify and solve the problem, it'd be greatly appreciated. 
sincerely, joe
