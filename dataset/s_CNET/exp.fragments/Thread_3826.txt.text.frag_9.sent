well thank you bob for that info, you know i really appreciate the reply. 
i surely wasn't looking for help, what i really wanted was a snide remark. 
oh sure, i will now look up on the internet how to make a dos boot disk and figure out how to flash my bios. 
so you certainly solved the problem. 
but maybe next time when you ask to &quot;check&quot; someone's work you will come back with a more informative response. 
such as, please look at this website, or simply state how you would make the disk. 
but i sure do appreciate being treated like an idiot.
