ok.. u have the same issue i got a year ago. 
there is no driver related, windows related or software related. 
your problem is with power, cuz ur able to run windows (may not) or start your machine but now u hve a power hungry machine. 
yes you bought a 500watts psu but it doesnt mean those watts are real watts. 
cheap psu tell you it may handle 600w but those arent real watts so if u got it for less than $50 usd u got cheated. 
you may need a sli certified power supply to let your machine run properly. 
i suggest you to go online stores and get a sli certified psu. 
cya laterz and wish ya luck. the lg.
