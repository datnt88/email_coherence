i have the same mobo and processor and the p4d will turn your pc into a space heater. 
your typical temps should be around cpu=65c, zone1=45c, zone2=35c. 
intel mobos allow the cpu to get really hot and won't kick the fans on high until 72c. to monitor your temps, install the latest bios, intel desktop utilities, chipset drivers from: to run cooler and quieter, get a new heatpipe based cooler like this one from asus for $25:
