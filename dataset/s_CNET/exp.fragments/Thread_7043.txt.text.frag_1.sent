hello, i'm buying a new imac and am trying to decide whether it's best to buy a larger hard drive in the mac or add more storage with an external drive. 
i currently have an older dell (8200 dimension) with an external 750gb seagate free agent pro drive for back up of pics, movies, etc... i'm looking at moving the external hd to the mac... but have read some interesting recent reviews on these seagate drives. 
my new imac is being used for photo/video editing/dvd creating. 
these picture/movie files just seem to swallow up the storage space and i want to configure this right! 
i have loads of family projects to do which involve a ton of scanning or digital image transfer of some sort! 
thanks for any help!
