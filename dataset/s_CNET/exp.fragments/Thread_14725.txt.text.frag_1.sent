i reinstalled windows xp on a computer w/ 2 drives. 
i took one out for the reinstall and after it was up and running i plugged the other back in and swapped the files out of the second to the main drive so thatit could be repartitioned all partitions on both drives become unaccesable. 
reran the install from cd and still it only seen the 5meg that the system keeps. 
it was a 60 gig. 
anybody have any idea why this happened? 
i got the files back by hooking the drive to another set up and useing a program called partition find and mount. 
it is a excelent free program
