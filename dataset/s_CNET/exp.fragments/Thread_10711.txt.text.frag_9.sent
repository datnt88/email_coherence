thanks alot man- you the man. 
you really help me. 
cant figure out how i got the drive to be reconized. 
my first motherboard (before this new one that i used old drive in)stopped working. 
and i found two viruses on old drive, but only after it was reconized. 
do you think the windows cd had something to do with it, when i reinstalled the drivers( but it was already showing in bios, and disk manager- just not in my computer?, and no hardware issues in device manager? 
any way this is what i knew could happen with these drives, and we worked it out. 
so thanks again for the info bob- the last bit totally helped. 
i'ld like to know what you think allowed the drive to be reconized, or was it a quirky thing. 
thanks
