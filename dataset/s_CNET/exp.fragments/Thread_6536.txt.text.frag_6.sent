don't tell a solder to put on a agp slot on your agp-less motherboard cause it will screw up big time! 
i tried it once 2 years ago with my old motherboard and the slot fried right on the moment of when i turned on the pc( hecka pissed me off), so i recommend you to get a motherboard with agp 8x instead( they're pretty cheap these days)
