i mistakenly removed the 128 ddr ram module from the mercury pvcle266m-l v3.0a motherboard of my system unit while power was still turned on. 
on switching off and replacing the memory module, and turning on my pc, it continously makes three intermediate beeps and will not come up. 
please what can i do? 
now i need help.
