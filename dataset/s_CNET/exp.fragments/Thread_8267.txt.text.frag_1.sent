hi all! 
i've been looking for a solution for this problem for two days now! 
my phone, laptop, and roku device all can connect to the d-link router, but cannot access the wireless network. 
everything gets hung up when it tries to obtain the ip address. 
i've tried ipconfic/release and renew, ect. 
i'm truly lost as to what to do next as i'm no computer pro! 
any help would be greatly appreciated!
