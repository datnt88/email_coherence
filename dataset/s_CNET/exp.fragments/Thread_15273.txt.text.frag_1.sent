i am currently using the modem which was given to me with the purchase of dsl with bellsouth quite a few years back. 
westell c90-610030-06. 
it is actually referred to as a dsl router on the bottom of the box, so i'm not sure weather to call it a modem or router? 
anyway, i am having trouble with it and i am looking to replace it. 
i am currently using a linksys wireless-g router for my wireless. 
anyway, my questions is: what kind of modem do i need to purchase to replace the existing bellsouth modem? 
will ony certain ones work or can i buy anything? 
also, i noticed that netgear makes a modem/router. 
can this be used in place of a seperate wireless router?
