this has become a recurring theme. 
people get boards and do everything but update the bios. 
my losses for such stand at zero boards in over 10 years. 
if i'm allowed a few &quot;saves&quot;, then i'm in the negative board losses. 
there is a method to flash the bios in a hot flashing method. 
which is how i recovered a few boards when i didn't have access to a device known as a prom programmer... if you want to try it, here's the google to the method.
