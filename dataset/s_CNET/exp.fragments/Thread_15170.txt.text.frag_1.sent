hi my laptop can not access the internet but it can connect. 
it says local and internet connected but i can't access ie or firefox and aim says server failure. 
it does this for both wireless connections and if i directly use an ethernet cable the same thing happens. 
well it was working before at my home connection then i went to a starbucks to connect to the tmobile wifi and then when i came back home the internet couldn't be accessed. 
i tried ipconfig and this is what shows up microsoft windows [version 6.0.6000] copyright 2006 microsoft corporation.
