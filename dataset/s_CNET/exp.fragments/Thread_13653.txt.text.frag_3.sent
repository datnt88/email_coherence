well, i tried to reboot into safe mode, but the process began to hang at the agp440.sys 
service. 
i found a ms support doc that instructed to disable this service (via windows recovery off the cd). 
so now it just hangs on another service in the boot process. 
when i don't try safe mode, it exhibits the same problem as before, no problems until after the windows progress baar screen. 
i'm at a loss as to what to do, and since i'm not that windows-savvy, i don't want to do anything irreparable. 
any suggestions?
