this could start a war but it isn't meant to. 
just like automobile brands are known for their particular strengths (or weaknesses), what about hard disk drive manufacturers? 
for example is one brand of hard drives more famous for reliability than, say, speed? is another brand better known for its speed but maybe priced too high? 
what's the conventional wisdom of those here who have worked with and know many of the various hdd brands?
