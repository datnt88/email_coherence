i thought this was the mac hardware forum. 
did i take a wrong turn someplace? 
it says mac hardware forum at the top of the page. 
so, to answer the mac hardware question: you can use any usb keyboard and any usb mouse to drive the imac g3. it does not require any special drivers as all the necessary usb drivers for a usb human interface device are already installed. 
the problem with using a windows keyboard is that some of the keys are labeled differently, notably the apple key which is the one to the immediate left of the keyboard. 
other than that, you should be good to go. 
you cannot use a serial or ps2 keyboard or mouse on the machine hope this clarifies things for you p
