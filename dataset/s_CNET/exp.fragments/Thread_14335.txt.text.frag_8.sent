my kid's machine taps about 95 watts or less sitting there and i think i measure 110 watts during game play. 
which is far better than some older machines we had. 
while it only had 2gb when we installed windows 7, we knew to install the 64 bit since we didn't want to install the os again later. 
it ran very well and then later, the second 2gb was added. the hp d5000 was all of 369 bucks at geeks.com and quite the bargain unit. 
yes we added the gt 220 and used one of the windows 7 family pack licenses so you can get an idea what the grand total was. the kid's happy so i can only hope that he doesn't bug me for a new machine this year.
