i've googled and tried for 3 days now. 
everything else connects fine except this laptop. 
i'm at my wit's end. 
netsh... doens't wok, ipconfig / flush dns & release & renew don't work. 
weirdly, it looks like it could possibly connect to an unsecured bt wifi but i don't want to pay for that if it won't work. 
i just don't get how my other laptop and iphone can connect and this one can't. 
or how it went wrong in the first place
