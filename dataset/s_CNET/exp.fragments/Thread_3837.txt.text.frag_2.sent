let's say you give me ten pcs with ide and sata connections. 
i would and could encounter ten different setups with no two being the same. 
which means the answer is maybe. 
only your machine's maker can guide you to the right settings if you can't figure it out on your own. 
and you can imagine i don't want to write down all the ten ways this could be configured in the bios, the os and the drivers. 
welcome the the (pc) tarpit issue.
