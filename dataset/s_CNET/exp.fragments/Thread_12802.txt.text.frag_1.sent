my old hp desk top hard drive crashed long ago (2008?). i had a tech come to the house to repair and replaced the hard drive. 
per my request , he had also opened up the hdd so i could see what the actual disk looked like inside. 
i removed the disk from its casing and stored it away (avoiding any static damage). 
since i no longer have its original casing and components , is it still possible to have any info/data recovered? 
ive heard recently that it is not possible. 
please let me know,,no point in still holding onto it if that is the case..thanks
