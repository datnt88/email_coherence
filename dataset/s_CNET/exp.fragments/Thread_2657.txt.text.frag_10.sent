if you have found bulging and leaking capictors on your motherboard, problem solved, the board is bad. 
i can't believe people trying to still give you a software solution after this post. 
apparently a couple of years ago there was a big batch of substandard capacitors produced. 
i know that there has been thousands of dell motherboards replaced due to this problem. 
my personal machine had a gigabyte md. that died after about 2 years with bad capacitors and i am sure there are many others. 
usually the processor chip, memory and other components are unharmed. 
your cheapest fix is to buy a new motherboard that is compatable with your cpu and memory and swap it out (usually around $50).
