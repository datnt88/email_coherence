let me know how that goes with installing the power supply. 
i have one that i intend to install at some point from my previous pc but it is for an agp based motherboard. 
i think i need an adapter/ide controller to get it to work with this machine. 
i've watched some high-def movie trailers through quicktime with the integrated graphics without a problem. 
it looks really good.
