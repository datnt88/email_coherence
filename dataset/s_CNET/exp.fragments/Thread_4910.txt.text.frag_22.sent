i was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the hourly aspect of the reboots that people seem to be experiencing. 
it's virtually on the dot every hour, e.g. when it starts happening, i can watch the clock and predict when it's going to happen again. 
i've tried the many bios fan settings discussed at the various sites/threads on this topic. 
none work for very long... in fact, the only pattern i notice is that if i go into the bios at all and make any change whatsoever (even if it's to just change a setting and then immediately change it back), it will fix the problem temporarily for several days or a couple of weeks. 
the last thing i've tried is disabling automatic fan detection - no problems so far, but again, that doesn't mean anything because it can happen any day now. 
anyway, i was wondering what might be happening every hour? 
examining event logs and processes and services and the like hasn't yielded any clues. 
are there any cooling or temperature or fan processes that run every hour that anyone knows of?
