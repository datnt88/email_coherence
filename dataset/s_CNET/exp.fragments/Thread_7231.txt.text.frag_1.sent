i bought a samsung mp3 for my son, age 8. it had a higher customer rating than ipod. 
so did alot of others. 
it has more functions and memory than ipod. 
never skips, cracks or jumps like some of the ipod reports i've read that say ipod does. 
we never had a problem of any kind. 
it's easy for my son to us and for me to load. 
and priced 25% cheaper for ipod's same type. 
yu-11 player is fabulous compared to the rest. 
when my son stated it had to be a mp3 and not ipod, i was a little confused. 
i thought there only was ipod. 
he said everyone had ipod and it was crap. 
he wanted a good one. 
come to find out he was right. 
but if you go to a retail store, you would think ipod is all that exists. 
why is this? are we such a &quot;shop faddy socity&quot; that we don't &quot;care to compare&quot; anymore? 
or is there a retail corruption, tring to steer our purchases?
