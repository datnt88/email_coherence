i'm hoping to upgrade my hard drive to a seagate momentus 7200.3 320gb. 
i am unsure whether my current notebook will find the hard drive, could someone please confirm this? 
hp doesn't provide hard drives above 120gb for this notebook. 
my specs: hp compaq nx7400 intel centrino duo t5600 1.8ghz 2 gig ddr2-667 ram 80gb toshiba s-ata hard drive (original) latest bios update from windows vista ultimate 32bit please help!!! thanks
