dunno. 
i hear shareaza kicks ass while few others say bearshare is neat. 
i've never used either of them, but if a lot of ppl swear by those, you could bet it's a solid choice. 
else, try reading reviews on these apps. 
a lot ppl mention that kazaa/lite used to reign supreme back 3 years ago but it's been usurped. 
afaik, limewire isn't horrendous, but it isn't good either.
