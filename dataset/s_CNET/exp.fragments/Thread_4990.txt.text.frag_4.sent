or your drive is not set proper to work in that case. 
i can't find your writings about reading the acomdata manual about the drive jumper setting. 
it could be wrong. 
no, i don't know what setting to use. 
there are far too many drive casings out there. 
you must tell me what setting the documentation calls for and what your drive is set for. 
next we have the corrupt drive data issue. 
after we know the drive jumper is right we try the following softwares (the demos are fine for this test.) getdataback zero assumption recovery easy recovery good luck, bob ps. all the above is written quickly so some get upset at the &quot;tone.&quot; 
sorry about that but i do my best to get you the information you need as fast as i can since this is all volunteer.
