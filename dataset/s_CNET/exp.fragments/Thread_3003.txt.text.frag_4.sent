i'm also in the planning stages of building a new computer. 
i have chosen all of my hardware which includes an amd x2 processor, asus motherboard, western digital sata hard drive, sony dvd-rw etc.. my main concert at the moment is making sure i buy all of the cables i require. the harddrives and optical drives that i have priced up are oem so i wont recieve the cables like i would in a retail box. 
also not sure about the motherboard having cables packaged with it. 
does anyone have or know the where about of a checklist of some description that i can use to make sure i have everything i need before i start. 
i'd hate to of started to find i was missing simple things.
