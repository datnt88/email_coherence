have you checked what the load on the system is when this happens? 
more than likely this deterioration is caused by the new windows indexing utility. 
go into the services panel under administrative tools and disable this. 
this utility is constantly polling the drive(s) to index directories & files and seems to suck up a lot of the system resources. 
unless you really need an indexing utility of this depth, disable it - most folks don't need it. 
better yet, uninstall it and the next time this utility pops up in an update, uncheck it. 
like i said, most people have no real use for it.
