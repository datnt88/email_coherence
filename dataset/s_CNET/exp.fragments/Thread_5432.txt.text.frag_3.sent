first off, i'll say i'm not a fan of buying computers remotely. 
i've done it a lot before (because of where i worked) and had doa computers from a couple different manufacturers. 
if what you get doesn't work, what are you gonna do? 
mess with it yourself to try to fix it? 
or give up the time & expense for a return or shipping for repair. 
a refurbished one has already been used and returned once. 
secondly, the poster's handle is softcoregamer. is a machine without a dedicated graphics card going to suit your needs? 
lastly, what's the motivation for 4 gb ram?
