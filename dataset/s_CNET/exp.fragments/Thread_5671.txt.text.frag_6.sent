one of the problems at the office is we often buy 6 or more of the same board or such. 
a batch of motherboards began to have issues, but not before we lost a few power supplies. 
finally i looked deeper and sure enough the motherboard had the bad cap problem. 
these bad capacitors not only cause booting issues that subside with bigger power supplies but can cause smoke and board scorch marks as the bad capacitors degrade and fail. 
some short out and do other bad behaviours. 
out of that batch of boards (6), only 2 are still running and we were able to find replacement motherboards so we'll swap those out if (and when) they glitch. 
here's a site and pictures about this issue -&gt; bob
