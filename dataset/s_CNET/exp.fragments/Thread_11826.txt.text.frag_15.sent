hi there - i set up a wireless network between 3 computers at work all operating on windows xp. they were all able to access the internet and could all see each other in my network places but like you i was not able to access the other computers. 
i too turned off my firewalls, configured my norton antivirus to share on a network and logged in as adminstrator but still no joy. 
i must have phoned very it support helpline going and worked overtime til 10 everynight for 3 weeks trying to sort the problem out and stil no joy. 
i then reinstalled windows on all three machines run the network setup wizard after creating a wirless network and it all worked first time. 
i avoided doing this to start with due to the time it would consume but now wish i done it from the start. 
i have since spoken to it technicians who seem to think that because i had attempted to set up so many networks the computer was not replacing the original permission settings with the new ones - not sure if this is any help but it worked for me. 
good luck
