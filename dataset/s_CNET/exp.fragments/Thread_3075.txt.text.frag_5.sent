i recently got a &quot;my flash&quot; 1g online for a very good price. 
i first did a google search for a &quot;1g usb&quot; and then went to one of the price comparison sites to find what i wanted for the best price. 
you should also check local weekly sales at such places as staples, office max, etc. they sometimes have outrageous sales. 
i recently had a friend pick up a 512 usb for $15. and thats it!
