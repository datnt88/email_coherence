most likely the id10t$ who did the case change work for you. 
i can't tell you exactly what your problem is, but the possibilities are: 1. cables, connectors and jumpers are not the same as they once were; 2. they damaged one or more of the components during the change-over. 
ie, did they work in on a static-free bench? 
did they forget to plug in the cpu hsf fan and the cpu overheated? 
are the components in your pc the very same ones you had when you brought it in (like, ram?)? 3. your windows installation has become corrupted for any one of a number of reasons, some of which could have occurred during the upgrade at the shop. 
have you called the shop and told them what you're experiencing? 
did they indicate to you that they had any problems doing the upgrade? 
are they willing to take a look at it free of charge to see what the problem might be (although i would be very skeptical of taking my pc back to the same place)? 
if you don't mind spending a little extra money, i would recommend having a second experienced and certified pc technician look at your system. 
get his analysis and take that back to the shop where you had the original work done. 
ask to speak to the owner or the manager. 
was the tech who did the work a new guy who they gave what they thought was an easy job to? 
one thing is for sure: something happened to your pc while it was in their care and custody. 
it's like you took your car in to have the tires rotated and now it suddenly doesn't run very well and has trouble starting in the morning. 
simply changing the case shouldn't have made any difference at all to the operation of your pc... bottom line. 
good luck!
