ok, so i'm in the market for a new desktop. 
i've been looking around at different types of computers, ibm, hp, gateway, alienware, the usual suspects. 
now, i currently have a dell, and despite a few problems, i have had few complaints with them. 
tech support to me is probally a lower issue for me, as i can troubleshoot most issues that arise. 
i'm a power freak. 
i love raw computing power. 
i play games off and on. 
mostly the computer would be used for internet, playing music, email, etc. i don't want to build my own computer. 
so what type of computer, just the computer, do you think is best? 
dell demension 8400 power mac/i-mac alienware area-51 3500 some hp pavilion some ibm
