fat32 can't read a filename of up to 255 characters like ntfs can. 
in your home, you probably don't have a file much deeper than &quot;c:program filessomeprogramsomethingwhatever&quot; which is only about 40 characters so you will have no problem. 
note this person is talking about a business. 
a whole new story. 
at my job, we have filenames over 200 characters, which isn't uncommon in a business environment. 
if you are using a win98 machine on our network, you won't be able to access many of our files. 
almost all of our &quot;shared&quot; files are over 150 characters.
