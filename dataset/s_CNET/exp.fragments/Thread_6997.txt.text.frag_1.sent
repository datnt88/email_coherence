just purchased western digital essential edition 500 gb my book 2.0 usb external drive. 
windows sees the hardware, but refuses to recognize any drives defined on it. 
according to the documentation that came with the drive, it should have installed some startup software when first connected. 
that didn't happen. 
the drive is correctly identified under disk drives in the windows device manager. 
however, disk management fails to see it. 
i see two other internal drives there, along with my cd and dvd drives. 
i considered the number of drives might be an issue and disconnected one of the hard drives. 
the wd drive still didn't show up. 
i considered that the drive might be assigned a particular letter, but reassigning existing drives to where &quot;e&quot; and &quot;f&quot; were open, did not help. 
i am running windows xp sp2 on a compaq presario. 
my usb ports are 2.0. 
all drivers are latest available. 
i have seen conflicting information about whether or not service pack 2 might be the issue. 
going back to sp1 isn't really an option. 
i really want to use this drive, but i am fast approaching the 30-day return policy limit. 
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
