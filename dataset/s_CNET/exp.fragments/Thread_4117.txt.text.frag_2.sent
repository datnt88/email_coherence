sadly, such schematics are non-existent outside of compaq (now hp) design offices. 
the brutal reality is that service at a component level exceeds the cost of replacing the motherboard or power supply. 
you may not flame me over the state of affairs, but we could discuss that changing the power supply is a good idea or trying this power supply on some other old atx board could reveal where the issue is. 
at the end of the day, you can keep searching for non-published schematics or decide you want the machine fixed by replacing the failed parts. 
a nuisance to some is that machines may not power up is the cmos reset jumper is missing or in the wrong position or if the cmos battery is missing or too low a voltage.
