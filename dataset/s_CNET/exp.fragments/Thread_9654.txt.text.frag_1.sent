i originally had a western digital hard drive specs are: 750 gb 7200 rpm 16mb cache the drive i purchased to install with it was a western digital caviar black specs are: 640 gb 7200rpm 64mb cache my problem is that once i received the new drive i wiped my computer and proceeded to install both drives everything installed fine. 
i used the newer drive that has better specs for the c: drive partition and the old drive that is a little bigger as a d drive. 
i'm only going to have the two partitions and i was going to use the d for just installing games, for instance my steam games which i have a lot of. 
everything installed great. 
didn't really have a problem. 
seemed like the new drive was a little slow at some points but still worked out. 
after i installed everything i've noticed that when i go to access or just load up steam or navigate on it i get the loading cursor for a few seconds, i'm not an impatient person but i mean it brings this up every few seconds for the simplest things.. like clicking on a particular game to view the page or initializing a game to install. 
i was told that this could be that the old drive that i'm putting just my games on (d drive) doesn't have a paging file for it and that if it did this might clear it up but then i read somewhere that putting a paging file on a drive you will only see if a difference if the drive you put it on is faster than the other. 
i'm kind of confused about the whole thing can you put a paging file on two drives? 
or can it just go on one? 
i just don't really have any knowledge on this topic at all and was wondering if someone could up my understanding of this, and also if this would even make a difference and if so how do i do it? 
thank you very much for any help.
