keep in mind, it's not just how many fans you have, but how they are placed. 
i've answered this a few times before, so i'll be brief (search fans or heat). 
keep the flow going in one direction. 
your chip is the most important, have the biggest fan you can. 
flow: i have all my fans flow (with filters) from the front, to the rear, with side fans blowing onto the chip radiator. 
i don't have it blowing harder than the chip fan (that is on the radiator). 
this gives &quot;cooler&quot; outside air. 
for your case, i would strongly suggest a large tower. 
i see they are scarce, except the pricey ones. 
air volume equals cooling too. 
i have a 5.25&quot; gap between by cd/dvd burners because they generate a large amount of heat. 
but nothing close to the heat my larger hdds do! 
here i have a (hard drive) fan vertically mounted & blowing against them. 
that air bounces down. 
well some of it does & some of it goes past. 
what you put in there is more up to what your budget is. 
than you work with how to cool it. 
adjusting your budget so that you have a good balance. 
i've put fans on the bottom of a case, to draw unheated air from there. 
i've also synced it with the chip's thermometer to aid in it's cooling. 
good luck on your build. 
always research your pieces before you want to buy them. 
now is a good time, as smart retailers are looking to pick up any sales that they can. 
you may even get a better piece or add other piece with the budget you have, & that's always cool.
