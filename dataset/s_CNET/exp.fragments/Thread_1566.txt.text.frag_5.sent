this has already been tested (as mentioned briefly in the original post). 
when i change the setup so that the cable connection is connected directly to his main machine (thus missing the router out completely) the issues do not occur. 
this is how i have confirmed that it is something to do with the router and/or its setup itself, however i am at a loss as to what element is at fault.
