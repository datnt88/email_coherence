mobos. of course at that time a bios update will be required. 
consider the two top abit mobos, the fatality or the sli. 
high price but ready for the future. 
very highly rated in testing sites. 
and the heat that the intel dual cores put out would scare the hades out of me. 
my thoughts are that intel will almost force one to go to a btx style system [new case, new mobo, new hsf et al. [of course intel has been pushing the btx spec, and vendors have tried to ognore them. 
a little like the intel insistance on sticking to rambus memory until****. 
there are some btx cases available now. the mobo goes in from the right side rather than the left as the current atx's go. 
change will continue to happen, simply progress, can't fight it.
