personally, i don't see why most people who buy desktops, don't buy laptops. 
with the advances in hdtv's these days, why not buy a laptop, hook it up to your tv, get a wireless keyboard and mouse, and use the tv as your main monitor? the advantage to this is the portability of the laptop. 
if someone want to watch tv while you are using the computer, you can take it into another room (or use it on the couch). 
when you need mobility, say on vacation or such, you can take a laptop right along with you. 
an advantage of having it hooked up to your tv is that you can stream movies from anywhere on the net or watch things like youtube. 
as far as which computer is right for you, that would be totally dependent on your price range and intended use.
