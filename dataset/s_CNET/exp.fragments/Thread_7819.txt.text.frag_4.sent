let's say i have some video capture device and it is set up to save one or so many hours in a file, then another and so on. 
said file is then &quot;shared&quot; on a network or off the network (your choice.) seems like you can do this? 
again, there are hundreds of video capture cards and even more software. 
it's like trying to find a dollar hamburger in l.a. bob
