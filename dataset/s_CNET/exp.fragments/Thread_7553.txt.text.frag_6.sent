some nas spread it around in another way. 
but since you have terabytes to backups, you'll want to get that quantum dlt unit. 
raid 5 still needs backup. 
it's not funny when the burglar gets in a shop and they didn't have any offsite backup. 
or other natural disaster. 
those that argue against backups... usually have not suffered or suffered enough.
