is there a way to see the mac desktop at the same time as the windows desktop? 
could it be that there is a setting in vm fusion that enables/disables the use of the mac optical drive? 
if you cannot see the mac desktop, are you sure that the disk is not mounting on the mac side instead of the windows side? 
i ask because i have parallels and it is possible to do all of the above with it.
