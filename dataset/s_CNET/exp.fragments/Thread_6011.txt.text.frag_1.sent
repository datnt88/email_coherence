hi. i am using 3g network over huawei ec315 usb. 
i have an tp-link td-w8950nd device too. 
i want to bridge my tp-link device with the hawei usb which doesn't supports more than 5 connections at a time. 
tp-link router supports bridge function but i don't know how to do this to expand my network connections. 
guide me in performing this function!
