i own the monitor and i love it. 
&quot; e'cept it is not a 30&quot;. 
the contrast ratio stated is 1000:1 - all i know is it is bright, (i'm running it at about 38% and it is still very bright with very deep blacks). 
it also has hdmi, dvi, vga, component, s-video, & composite inputs, along with digital sound output from the hdmi source(for the optional sound bar), & the sound bar has analogue and digital audio inputs. the screen has a max of 1920 x 1200 pixels per inch w/ faroudja video up-converting circuit, and 3ms response time. 
it shows 1080p easy. 
it pivots from landscape to portrait mode, and can rise up and down about 3&quot;. 
you can power it on without turning on your computer, to watch a external source (dvd player, video feed, camera feed). 
i bought mine from hsn&gt;$899.99 + tax/shipping, with a 1.6 gb pentium dual-core, 250 gig hd, dvd burner, vista...and it runs like a top! they still have that same priced deal with a 320 gig hd. gateway sells it by itself for $499.99, but check the tax/shipping/insurance costs, cause when i ordered, if i had gotten it thru them it would have cost me $750.00 delivered&gt; so the package was only $200.00 more with the computer. 
in the stores, at the time, it was going for up to $799.99 by itself! it has beautiful color, and i'm very happy with mine. the only things it lacks is a built in sd/hd tuner, or a remote. 
i've 2 dvd recorders w/ built-in tuners and remotes so that is not a problem. 
soon to get a hd tuner w/hdmi. 
this thing is a beauty!!! and i do'nt work for or sell for gateway.
