sure. it's strictly a matter of cutting a big hole in the right place to mount a fan, then wire it up. 
it's not a big deal if you can get a nice case fan, do the planning and metal work and the minor electrical hookup. 
but the point is that the case was for something of about 1/4 the watts we see from today's cpus.
