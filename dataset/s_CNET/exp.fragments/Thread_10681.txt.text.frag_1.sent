hello, my filehippo updater informed me i needed to update the driver for my video card..nvidia geforce fx 5200... to nvidia forceware 178.13 whql xp. i have a lan-plus machine that runs windows xpsp3. 
amd athlon xp 25000+ processor,250gb hd and 1.2 gb ram. 
after downloading it would not install. the message was that it could'nt find suitable hardware. 
i reinstalled the old driver. 
after installing the old driver,i rechecked the updater and there was no update notice for my video card ! 
can someone clue me in on this situation ? 
thanks
