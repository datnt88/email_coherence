i am using a powerspec external enclosure with an eide 250gb western digital drive and connected via usb 2.0, on my &quot;old reliable&quot; hp pavilion desktop, xp pro sp2... always updated. 
i use synchronization software (syncback) to help me manage manual back-ups from time to time. 
additionally, i store all of my media on the external drive. 
recently, especially when i play video files, the drive appears to spontaneously remove itself from windows... the pc crashes instantly! 
i have to use a soft reset, and the system seems fine. 
i have tried several media applications. 
all with the same outcome. 
i have checked the system hardware config. 
all drivers are installed correctly, and all detectable hardware seems to be fully operational. 
i suspected that my pci usb 2.0 card may be bad... so i installed a new one in an open slot yet the problem persists. 
i would be grateful if anyone has an idea for me to try... i like having all of these large files on my external, but they aren't readily viewable with this happening. 
thanks!
