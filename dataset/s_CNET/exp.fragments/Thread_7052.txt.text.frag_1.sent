hey people first of all apologies if this is in the wrong section, i was a little confused to where to create a ew topic and thought this would be the best place but mods please remove if you feel necessary. 
i was hoping someone could offer me a little support regarding trying to add my new tv/monitor as my secondary monitor to my pc, ideally what i want is when you add a second monitor to your laptop as an extended monitor that is what i require. is this possible? 
if so how? would i need to purchase an additional graphioc card for my pc? could you recommend me one? 
or could i purchase something like a vga splitter which i would plug in the back of my vga slot and it would have two female vga connections? 
thank you.
