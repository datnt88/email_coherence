it means there is a hard failure most of the time. 
cable, card or damaged os. to sniff out which i boot a livecd called ubuntu (see google) since it runs from cd with no install. 
if it can't use the ethernet i know it's cable, card or router ports. 
there are far too many discussions about the 169 issue but that's the boiled down version and the test i use.
