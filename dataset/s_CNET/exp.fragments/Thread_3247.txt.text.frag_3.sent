the wap should work fine with the router. 
you do have to run a cable to it from the router, so that may be an issue. 
if you are far enough away from any neighbors wireless connection, security is less of a concern. 
the firewall provided by the router is no more then nat, which to the more security conscious users is no protection. 
but firewalls can interfere with network sharing if not set up properly.
