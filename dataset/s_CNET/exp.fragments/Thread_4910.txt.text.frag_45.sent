i am wanting to but this one, is this problem only with the gt5628? 
or also the gm5632e, i notice on best buy's page the gm gets better reviews then the gt, but on paper, they seem to be about the same computer. 
also on the power supply, can anyone tell me how good it really is? the specs on it are 400 watts with 18a on the 12v rails, but then when you go look at the 8500 gt in a box, it says it requires 22a on the 12v rail. 
could this be one of the problems? 
thanks
