you are exactly right about the optical drives. 
i hadn't (but should have) thought of them. 
since there are 2 optical drives on the xps, i've already used those 2 channels, but by nature of their presence, can i assume that i won't have to worry about drivers for the new ide controller card? 
when i've just added new hard drives to systems in the past they always shipped with all this software i didn't need anyway, at least for winxp.
