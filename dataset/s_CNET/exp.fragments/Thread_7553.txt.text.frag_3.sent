i did some estimates and it looks like dvd quality video is around 5mb/s, 720p hd would be 20mb/s, and 1080p hd would be 60mb/s. 
if this is right even with 4 tvs playing video from the server at the same time it would most likely never need to supply more than 100mb/s. 
i might still go to gigabit ethernet just for future proofing. 
if someone can check those numbers for i'd appreciate it. 
they seem low, since i get jerky video playing dvd video over a wireless connection. 
my wireless connection usually runs about 30 mb/s.
