in all honesty, you could be right about liteon, (and if you are, i'll be the first to send you an email to attest to it in about 30 days. 
- my thing, is that since i am fairly new to the ''lightscribe'' thang, i can't see spending about a ''c-note'' on one, and risking even hp giving me crap. 
(i don't think there is one manufacturer out there who doesn't have any probs, am i right? 
- i mean, yes, hp did indeed make /invent the lightscribe, but thank god for competition, so all these ''big biznessez'' (spelled wrong on purpose) can't monopolize on new technology. 
- if you read my reply to this issue above, you'll see that it was indeed my fault as to not being able to run it in the enclosure box. 
- i did a ''test'' lightscribe ''burn'' with a picture from the movie ''maid in manhattan'', and quite honestly, it's pretty freekin' good, man! 
:-d - i recently learned that liteon is a mitsubishi co. which does make some quality tech! 
(i've owned a 36'' stereo tv by mga/mitsubishi for about 8 years! 
it has multiple connections for surround / theatre sound, and...still has bomb-ass picture and sound quality!) - (i'll probably still get that ''vertically-standing'' black unit by hp because i do wish to compare quality! 
and i think hp is american-made! 
least i hope so! 
:-d ) - as i said, you may be right, blazer... we'll both know soon, right? 
- take care dude! 
(two thumbs way up!) - thanks again for your reply post! 
i appreciate it! 
- one!
