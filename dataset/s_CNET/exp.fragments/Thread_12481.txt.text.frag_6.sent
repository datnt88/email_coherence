i bought a $20 usb mic, plugged it in, and it works great! 
audigy 2 zs still being used for playback. 
only thing i can't get usb mic to work with is with the &quot;speakerphone&quot; cabalities of my modem. 
this is probably a different issue, however. 
mic works great with sound recorder, and all other programs using voice input.
