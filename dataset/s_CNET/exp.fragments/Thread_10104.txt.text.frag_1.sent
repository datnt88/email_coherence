i've decided to wait on buying a new desk top (pc) for awhile. 
decided to upgrade my graphics card (nvidia geforce fx 5600) from my hp pavilion a450y, xp. problem - i see there are pci, pci 64, pci express, etc. the device manager says the current display adapter is found in the pci bus. 
what do i need to know to buy the correct graphics card?
