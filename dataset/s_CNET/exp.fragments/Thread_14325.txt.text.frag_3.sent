600dpi fill about any need you should get into. 
of course if your picky or get into specific needs like cad or such, then 1200 is better, but some printers use a &quot;rastering&quot; to smooth the jaggies into better output. the scheme like from hp is firmware driven, maybe s/w too, but canon better models offer the same to get 1200dpi effects as well as others, so more_threads threads the specs to find out how they arrive at dpi rating, but most modern printers are 600dpi capable at least. 
your old hpiii was default at 300dpi.
