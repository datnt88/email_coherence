usb: have you installed the latest nforce4 adm drivers? 
also, make sure bios-&gt;integrated peripherals-&gt;onchip usb is set to v1.1+v2.0. 
hd: sata drives are typically exposed as ata devices by the mobo unless you turn on raid. 
as for your c: being removable, make sure its write policy is &quot;optimized for performance.&quot; 
i'll do some more checking to see how to tell windows its not removable. 
dvd: xp doesn't come with a dvd decoder. 
you need a third party product like nero (full version), powerdvd, windvd, etc. in order to watch dvds. 
there's probably a decoder on your hp software cds but with the new hardware, it may not think it's an hp pc.
