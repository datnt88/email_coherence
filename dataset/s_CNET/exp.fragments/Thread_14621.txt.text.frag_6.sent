look, we all know mac is better. 
it is a lot better than any pc on the market. 
first of all, a pc desktop comes with a 4-ton box and a crappy os. mac is faster, sleeker and more user friendly than a pc. hp is a good laptop, but even now, the only thing making it a good laptop is the fact that it is using mac's technology. 
as soon as mac made a new design in keyboards (bigger keys, backlights and spacing) hp did(about a month later.) mac is better in just about every way. 
(and don't get me started on how mac doesn't crash or get viruses and windows do.)
