you keep saying fat32 [sucks] but can anyone at least tell me clearly wether it is fixable. 
i don't know, i saw disk warrior can repair directories but only mac directories i disconnected the hard drive on a mac (you push and hold down the button till it beeps and the hard drive spins down). 
usually its fine when you perform it on a windows but when you disconnect this way on a mac it becomes unusable. 
i really need helpful replies please bob, your kinda helping but i already realized that i have to disconnect first for the second time (second failed hard drive). 
can you at least tell if there is any hope of restoring the drive or is my best bet to retrieve the data, such as using data rescue. 
i know data rescue ii works but it doesn't come with the file names, i have thousands of pictures each organized, and thousand of (legal) mp3 rips from my cds. 
i don't want to spend thousands of hours relabeling them. 
i'm in college and i don't have that kind of time for a while but i want some of the data now. 
thanks
