...it asked me if i need to install a 3rd party ssci or raid driver, which i did not. 
the only drivers that came with the motherboard are an sata raid driver and drivers for the chipset, usb and onboard lan. 
all of these problems started happening after i installed this motherboard and cpu; before i was using a p4 and an hp motherboard. 
my pc was originally an hp, and that's why i don't have any documentation or anything for the hard drive. 
and maybe i should mention that i'm using xp home with sp2 and all the latest updates.
