video card vendors differ amongest themselves when using the same chipset, so it really depends. 
here is a link, but you need to guess or estimate what should work for you. 
google for more as there are alot of vendors out there. 
its a good chance you have a 50mm fan. 
on top of that, vendors vary how they attach and that can cause havoc. 
sometimes, i get lucky and i'm able to relube the fan, doing this: \\\\\\\\\\\ if you have a noisy fan and no replacement, try the following. 
remove fan from mounting and save screws or unclip the fan. 
clean any dust or dirt build-up at this time as best as possible. 
now with fan in hand, most fans have a sticker(s) top or bottom. 
look for the non-fan blade side, this is the bottom. 
on bottom side slice small half-moon cut, slightly off-center on the sticker/decal leaving a flap. 
you *don't* want to remove sticker/decal entirely. 
flip flap open to expose center of fan and place 1 drop of oil there, don't over do it, blot any excess oil. 
rotate the fan to work the oil in and then place fan with bottom side up on a flat surface. 
allow gravity to migrate oil into bearing for 30-minutes or over night if possible.when done, tape over the cut flap and remount fan. 
use deft care and don't over-tighten screws, you're done. 
good luck -----willy
