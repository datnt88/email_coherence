if your a gamer....forget it...cut your losses. 
i'm not a gamer. 
if i had such a machine and it did what i needed but was slow. 
i would work on being malware free....cost&gt;free. 
i would work on making my startup group skinny...cost&gt;free. 
i would consider adding 256&gt;512mb ram....cost&gt;20/40 bucks. 
see crucial.com for ram help. 
i'll assume the os is xp.
