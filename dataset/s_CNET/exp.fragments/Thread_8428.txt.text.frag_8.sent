well i pressed reset for both routers... i configured my alcatel 510 speedtouch first...got the net connection up for tt...then managed to get back the ip required for it... then reset belkin and reinstalled the thing assigned a separate ip for it... then reassigned the cables again... and vuala! 
my belkin now creates the wireless network...while the alcatel 510 provides the internet connection... cause my belkin doesn't have a modem inside only a router/wireless thing so in the end all is well thanks alot moderator =)
