fter a couple months use, my monitor started showing horizontal lines all over the screen. 
some of the lines were small and some were quite large. 
then my system started crashing. 
sometimes it would recover and give me a message that said &quot;vpu recover has reset your graphics accelerator as it was no longer responding to graphics driver commands.&quot; 
other times it would not come back and i'd need to reset the computer. 
here's what i've tried so far: 1) uninstalled video drivers and reinstalled from files downloaded from ati site. 
when that made no difference, tried also with file downloaded from msi site. 
still no help. 
2) tried two other monitors, one an lcd and one crt. 
same thing on both other monitors. 
3) sent card back to msi. 
they checked it out & said it was fine. 
4) installed new power supply. 
no help. 
5) finally i uninstalled the radeon video adapters and the ati drivers. 
that stopped the system from crashing but i still get very small lines throughout the screen and the screen is very jerky when i scroll up & down. 
everything else is fine. 
i can run all my programs. 
the display is just very bad. 
i'm aware that this is not a very good vga card. is it possible that the drivers for this card are not compatible with my mobo? 
or could it be something else?
