1. &quot;because both the hardware and software have to be compatible&quot; this is untrue if we think about capture and content creation. 
only the capture software needs to work. 
more about codecs. 
2. about codecs. 
i will not duplicate all there is to know about codecs here. 
if i did then my post would not fit (and it would duplicate the web!) so let's get down to the basics. 
many folk try to capture and encode to some encoding at the same time. 
this is done in windows by selecting the desired codec. 
since this will be used by the new system you hope will fix your problems my bet is that it will still hang. 
you can look up codec sniper and check if you can uninstall codecs and then try different codecs. 
you write you are no hacker but when it comes to this issue you find you have to catch up.
