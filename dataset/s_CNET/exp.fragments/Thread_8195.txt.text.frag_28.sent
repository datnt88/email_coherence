i don't find the analogy with the automobile very persuasive. 
automobiles do last 10 years or more, and the manufacturers supply replacement parts for even longer. 
when an automobile breaks down, you can repair it--you do not need to junk it. 
visioneer abandoned this product after only one year or two. 
nor is the fact that support is &quot;free&quot; a justification. 
i was willing to pay for the fix (provided it didn't cost more than replacing the whole damn thing), paid for a telephone call, and still was brushed off. 
moreover, everyone knows that operating systems are constantly being upgraded and patched and buysrs have a reasonable expectation that the company selling you a peripheral will provide updated drivers during the life of the hardware (within reason). 
visioneer misled all of us purchasers when it reneged on this implied (but very real) representation. 
(any class action litigators listening??) this is a company that has no interest in establishing customer loyalty, and it certainly won't have mine. 
why in the the world would i buy something from a company that won't update drivers the day after i buy the hardware???? while i'm posting this message, let me add to my prior description of the problem: 1) first, we acquired the scanners from e-machines (now a gateway subsidiary), not compaq; 2) i tried to install two of the scanners on a ''clean'' machine running me. 
same problem. 
so it isn't a question of something corrupting the drivers after they are installed.
