hi, i got the same system with a radeon 9800 pro and a wd 160 gb. only one problem: hd is switched off at end of bios setup, then boots properly the xp system. 
dont know the reason for the switch off at begin of session (350 w power supply should be enough but if not it could cause the problem). 
i will post when the issue is solved. 
anyone has an idea? 
i will test a 400 w psu.
