hi, i hope you can help. 
i am trying to help out a friend with xp. he has 2 external hard drives on is a 500 gb western digital the other is a 1.5 gb solo external hard drive fireproof and waterproof...yeh a little over kill! 
his computer is about 8 year old dell...it even has a floppy drive. 
he saves everything! 
his hard drive has almost no free space. 
what i would love to do is set up his computer to save all his files directly to the 500 gb hard drive. 
not on his computers hard drive! 
i was going to partition the 1.5 gb hard drive so there is a complete back up of his computer hard drive on the first partiion. 
also, i would love to sync his 1.5 gb second partition to his 500 gb hard drive (which is actually saving all his files? 
do you have any suggestions? 
i have figured out how to assign dirve letters. 
i know how to partition. 
i don't know how to sync one hard drive to the other or automatically save files directly to the 500gb. 
note: i have backed up his hard drive right now to the 500gb. 
using windows back up. 
he deleted the wd software of the 500gb! 
thanks for your time...ynotbme &lt;div class=&quot;inter-pagination collapsable&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postactions collapsable clearfix clearboth&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
