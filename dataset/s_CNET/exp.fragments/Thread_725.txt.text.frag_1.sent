so i just set up my alcatel speedtouch usb adsl modem, which is is connected to my laptop. 
but, i also have a smc 7004vwbr 4 port wireless router and would like to get all our laptops in my house connected to wireless. is this wireless router compatible with my speedtouch ucb adsl modem? 
will i be able to set up a wireless system in my house, so that all the laptops w/wireless cards can access the internet? 
what do i do next? 
i'm clueless! 
or, do i have to resort to buying a combo adsl wireless router/modem? 
many thanks, jenny
