what do you guys think? 
i can't but a price on it. 
can you guys tell me a reasonable price for it. 
*the reason i'm selling it is because i bough an hp laptop and i have it connected to the expansion bay and well i can use it as a desktop. 
so i prefer to have one computer instead of two computers.
