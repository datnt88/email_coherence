the g5 has 64 bit registers and data paths, as opposed to the intel chips which are 32-bit. 
(this made me wonder why the switch to intel and not amd, an underdog like apple itself). 
in addition to which the fsbs are a good 25%+ faster than the intel equivalents. 
plus, despite being slower from a clock-speed standpoint the g5 chips can no more flops than the fastest desktop p4. so i do agree, that we have to wait for the benchmarks, but i would be greatly surprised (and appalled that i would have to eat my words) if they can come anywhere near, much less surpass, the dual core g5 with native osx versus the 32-bit intel duo emulating osx via rosetta (but i shall keep my words soft just in case!)
