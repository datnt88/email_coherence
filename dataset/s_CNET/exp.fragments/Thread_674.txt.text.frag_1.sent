i use to have a cannon ink jet an i could always refill the ink for less than $8, instead of buying a brand new cartridge. 
that printer finally died. 
i now have a lexmark ink jet, and the cartridges are chipped, this means it tracks the amount of ink and will stop working if you refill it. 
since ink cartridges are at least $30 and do not last long, what brand of printer should i buy that is kinda cheap &gt;$40?
