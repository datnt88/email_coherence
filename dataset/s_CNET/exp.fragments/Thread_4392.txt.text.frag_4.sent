sometimes the install cd will be separated by os versions. 
i have a dlink wireless card for my laptop and i had to browse to the path. 
they had os install folders for 98, 2000, me, xp on the installation disk. 
it wouldn't automatically check each folder and install the correlating drivers/software.
