finally saw that link you posted. 
that was a fascinating video. 
thanks again for sharing. 
i'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however. 
i'd just like to use it for video im, so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid, i don't think i'd mind. 
i do appreciate your responses though.
