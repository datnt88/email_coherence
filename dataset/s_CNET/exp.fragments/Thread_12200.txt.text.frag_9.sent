i'm not even talking about competition gaming you obviously don't understand the content of that post basically what i'm saying is that if you wish to be replacing your graphics card in the next 6 months because it cannot play upcoming games, buy a radeon x most serious gamers do not use the best hardware, as they play with reduced settings to get the game to run as fast as possible, it's not about iq to them, it's about the game itself in addition i'm talking about futureproof ability, not gaming speed also as i don't know gwd means, i will have to refer to it gives me the following john, neither of those definitions seems appropriate to me and i'll take my quote back thankyou, as i really am not trying to attack you, just trying to (still) keep the confusion level down
