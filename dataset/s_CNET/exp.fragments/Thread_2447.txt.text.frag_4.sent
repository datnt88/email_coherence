i know that the computer came with windows me, the previous owner had them put win 98 on it. 
when i got the computer there was no sound, i wiped the drive with fdisk, then re-installed windows 98. i went to the compac site and looked up the specs on the computers origianl configuration and i downloaded 2 different drivers, neither one of them worked. 
i went to the bios and defaulted back to the origianl settings, that didn't help. 
how can i figure out what isn't working so i can fix that. 
i downloaded the manual on the particular kind of motherboard it is, and there is no new info there. 
in startup it recognizes a pci card, but never lets me download drivers. 
this is a basic system, no extras. 
i can't believe that it just isn't going to work, and if that is true, why didn't my sound card work? 
perhaps i need to go with name brand that comes with a disk. 
help!
