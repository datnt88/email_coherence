my pc is as follows: intel 945p motherboard thermaltake 430w power supply i have two usb slots on the board and i have tried both of them. 
to no avail. 
i will try to blow any dust off and try again, but i have repeatedly tried to unplug and plug the thing back in, again having no luck. 
do you think that the power supply isnt puching enough, or would it be a motherboard problem? 
there is no power dongle on the reader unit.
