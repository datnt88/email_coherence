well, i wouldn't exactly say that i am a computer whiz-but i do know my fair share of what's going on inside these beautiful little life-leeching boxes ;p i recently took up the challenge of figuring out what's wrong with a friends' computer. 
his words were: &quot;it stays on for like 5 seconds and shuts itself off&quot;. 
i immediately knew this was an overheating issue (happened to me a million times). 
so i began troubleshooting this issue, reset everything into their little nooks and crannys, checked the cpu grease, bought some arctic silver and all that. 
that issue is now solved! 
i have run into another problem! 
:s the computer is on, it posts...everything. the only issue is every monitor that i try is still not responding; ranging from old to brand new out of the box. 
i first thought maybe it was previously set to a video card, tried that and nothing. 
i am more than positive it is just simply a bios setting that needs to be tweaked, but i cannot get the screen to respond so i can see if my keystrokes are working to enter bios. 
keyboard works correctly, so does the ps-2 jack....... anyone have any clue what is happening? the most info i have been able to figure out is that it is obviously a self-built rig: gigabyte ga-k8vm800m, amd processor...not sure about the make..grease is all over....
