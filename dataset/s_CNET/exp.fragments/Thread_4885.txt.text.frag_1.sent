hello, i currently have an asus u81a, running vista 64bit, and the hard drive just went bad. the best price i can get on the repair is $250 which is about half of what i paid for the laptop 2 years ago. 
i have loved this thing, but dont love vista. 
so my should i just buy a new computer or fix this one? 
and if i go for a new one what would be a good idea? it has a 320gb hard drive and 4gb ram, with a intell core 2 duo. 
i am a college student going into my last year, and this things computing power has been more than enough since i don't play a lot of games.
