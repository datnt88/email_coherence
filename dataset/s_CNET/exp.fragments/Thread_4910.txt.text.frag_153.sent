you shouldn't need to be a computer expert to run an off the shelf system. 
i have built systems before, and you expect a certain amount of tinkering etc. but gateway really bit the big one on the gm5478! 
i have rethought my idea of spending any money to upgrade mine. 
fundamentally it is an unstable, unreliable system. 
gateway really lost me as a customer as well, and anyone who asks my opinion (practically everyone i know asks me as i'm a computer science grad). 
i guess as soon as my graphics card, motherboard or power supply blow up (one of them is making an awful grinding noise) i'm gonna get a dell or maybe an hp... definitely not a gateway!!! i also couldn't agree more about the horrible customer service!
