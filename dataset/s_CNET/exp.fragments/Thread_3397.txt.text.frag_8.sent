all the info is much much appreciated. 
for the psu, i ended up getting the corsair cmpsu-750tx 750-watt tx series. 
it got the best reviews and ratings out of any that i saw in that wattage range on newegg, and it'll provide more than enough power than i know i'll need. 
and i also got a cooler master fan for my processor, one that i don't have the name of right off of the top of my head and am too lazy to get out of my nice comfy bed to look at the box, but it was highly recommended by pcmag to replace the stock cooler that came with my i7 950. 
i will buy more fans, but i wanted to finish most of the build first, to see how many more i can fit, given that i chose a mid-tower. 
i will only be installing one 1tb hdd for now so there should be extra space for a fan there, and we'll see what happens... i should be starting on the build by tuesday at the latest, the case and power cord as well as my hdd connectors are coming in the mail from newegg. 
will keep updated, especially with any more questions i might have.
