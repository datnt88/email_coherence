my desktop started doing this intermittantly a while ago. 
i'd try booting again and it would eventually boot successfully. 
however, eventually it quit. 
i recall having this problem when there was a bad master boot record. 
fixed it and no further problems. 
this time is different. 
rewriting the mbr doesn't fix it. 
since it was time to clean up my hdd, i reinstalled win xp pro. 
this involved formatting the drive. 
still - same problem. 
i can still use the pc by leaving my xp cd in the drive. 
during the boot sequence i am prompted with &quot;press any key to boot from cd.&quot; if i ignore the prompt and let the boot sequence go on, i'll be able to boot right to my hard drive. 
any ideas?? dell xps 1000r 1000 mhz 60 gb hdd 512 mb ram thanks.
