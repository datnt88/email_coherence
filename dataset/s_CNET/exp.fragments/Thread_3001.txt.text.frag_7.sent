ive got a quad core 6600 (q6600) ordered for gaming atm. 
i did a fair bit of research and in my opinion the quad is definately the one to go for. 
this is why: 1) its one of the latest on the market 2) the latest games are beginning to ulitize the power of quad which is why u want one if ur into running ur games as best u can. 
3) while its a slightly lower end cpu than that of other quad core cpus (eg. 
q6700, q6850) imo it is still more than enough for people not willing to spend a kings fortune to go all the way on their gaming machine. 
4) its supposed to have pretty good over-clocking potential. 
(so even if it isnt good enough for you, *which i doubt*, you still have the oportunity to make it faster :d) 5) i dont think there will be a game it wont play for quite a while. 
lol look i dont know all the specs, for it im sorry but if ur in the market for a gaming pc, a q6600 while definately be lovely to play on. 
just make sure u get a decent gpu to go with it!!! (im getting the nvidia xfx 8800gtx which is a bit excessive but i would recommend it. 
if not in ur price range maybe go for the 8800 gts 320 or 640mb versions. 
its all good ps. happy gaming
