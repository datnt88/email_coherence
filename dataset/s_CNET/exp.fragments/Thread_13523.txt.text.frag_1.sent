i am freaking out. 
i received a maxtor one-touch 500 gig external hard drive for my birthday last year. 
i have been using it without any problems up until today. 
i have all my music, all my backups, and all my videos stored on this thing. 
today, i open up the next episode of bones with vlc media player, and it plays the first 8 seconds and freezes. 
curious, i open up other files in the same folder, and they all behave the same. 
so, i figure now would be a great time to defrag my external, and my computer. 
i also run ccleaner, spybot, and uninstall some old programs. 
the problem is now worse. 
it seems that around 70% of my eternal is messed up in some way, even the .txt 
files! 
i can click on an episode from house md, and vlc or wmp will play a song from journey! they are in completely separate directories, but are somehow connected. 
the documents i had stored on there respond similarly. 
if they are linked to something that notepad is not meant to read, they display strange characters or boxes. 
i have no idea what is going on, but it seems like something has messed with the file structure and cross-linked files for some strange reason. 
wiping my external and replacing all the lost media will take months, and i probably wont be able to recover everything. 
if there is any way to correct the file system and make it so that bones episodes dont play music from my turisas collection, i would love to hear it. 
things i have done: defraged several times uninstalled and re-installed vlc downloaded codec packs restarted tried other media players cried scanned for viruses stubbornly clicked videos over and over, hoping for different results died a little inside googled like a madman made a cnet account.
