ok, i live in a house with 4 other people each have their own computer. 
we have cable internet coming into the house and i was wondering how we would split that connection to all 5 computers. 
there are 3 people with desktops that dont need a wireless connection but there are 2 people that have notebooks that want a wireless connection. 
what type or router(s) would i need to get so that the computers would split the connection almost evenly? 
or would it just be easier and faster for everyone just to direct connect to a router? 
also what type of speed can we expect for each computer? 
any help would be very much appreciated. 
thanks.
