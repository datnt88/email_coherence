if the drive is not communicating with the cpu, it can not register with my computer. 
(1) eide cables have an orientation &quot;notch&quot; that precludes you plugging the eide cable upside down. 
some are embossed on the header. 
(2) try the above, with power, but do not connect the usb cable. 
does the drive spin? 
if not, the adapter circuit board was more than likely shorted. 
you did not say if power was on while plugging the eide cable to the controller board. 
that will short out the controller. 
(3) if the drive is spinning, then plug in the usb cable. 
(4) check device manager? 
any yellow flags on the usb controllers? 
if not, ok. if so, delete only the affected item. 
re-boot. 
go to 3. (5) are you using a usb hub? 
if so, use any usb port on the back. 
not the front. 
have seen some hp's with faulty front usb grounds.
