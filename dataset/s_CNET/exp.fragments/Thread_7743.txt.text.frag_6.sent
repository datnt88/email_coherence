thnik about this, between an ipod touch (or iphone) and an ipad, why would anyone need a 7&quot; screen? 
it's too bulky to carry easily, i consider the touch too big, but i used to carry a &quot;brick&quot; cell phone, so that size is not so bad. the ipad is ideal in size, being about the size of a portfolio or 8.5 x 11&quot; sheet of paper. 
too small means compromise, i don't want to need to zoom in all the time. the 7&quot; would simply not fit any niche for me or my family. 
price is not as important as function. 
people obcess about price and not how they will use it. 
cheaper does not mean better. 
buy what you need and what suits you best. 
buy a 1 or 2 generation older model. 
if you have to have the latest thing, then why are you reading this post? 
:p
