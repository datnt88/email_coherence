do you have access to a patch cable? 
take the one you're using for your desktop (i'm assuming you have one). 
connect your laptop to it. 
if you have internet connection, then your router (wired portion of it anyway) and your laptop is not the problem. 
it's only your wireless stuff that's gone kaput.
