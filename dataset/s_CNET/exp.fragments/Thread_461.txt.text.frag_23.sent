i have used hp and canon printers in the past and only lately bought an epson stylus c65 for home use. 
i was attracted by the company &quot;bla bla&quot; concerning the new 4 cartriges (black, cyan, yellow, magenta)system that according to them will save you money being.. &quot;separate cartriges&quot;!?!?! to my surprise i realized that if one of the colour cartrige is missing or out of ink, one cannot print in the &quot;black mode&quot; at all. 
this is something i could do on my old hp and canon, i could infact print with the black cartrige even if the colour one was missing. 
we all know that printers companies make a lot more money on the sale of ink cartrages than on printers alone. 
unfortunately the end user is paying too much of a high price by being forced in this case to buy a colour cartridge even if he is not using it. 
i feel as if i have been &quot;legally&quot; ripped off!
