it's a pity you tried yourself. 
a specialized data recovery company would have done better, and it might be more expensive now than it would have been if you hadn't started yourself. 
anyway, a usb-stick should - exactly like a floppy 15 years ago - be considered as a good means to move data between computers. 
not as permanent storage, and certainly not as a good place to store the only copy of some data. 
so - for everybody following that simple rule - no data is ever lost by a failed drive and there's no need at all for any expensive recovery. 
let's hope you fall in that category.
