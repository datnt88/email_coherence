are owners that have wifi routers that connect to all machines but one. 
it's hard for them to accept it when i reenable ssid broadcast, turn off wep/wpa and get it connected. 
we then experiment to see what security does work. 
we also test the laptop at hotspots if it doesn't connect. 
if it doesn't at 2 hotspots and my laptop does then it's either a bum install of the os or dead hardware. 
sometimes the owner didn't know to use the button on the laptop to turn the wifi on and off. 
hope this helps.
