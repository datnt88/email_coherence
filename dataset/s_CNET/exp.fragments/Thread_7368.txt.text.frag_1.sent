i purchased a new ipad last week! 
however, news today i read shows that in the next ipad event a more latest ipad is going to be released!! this is my first apple product, and one reason as to why i delayed buying the ipad in the first place. 
my manager told me &quot;they're always going to be updating the products&quot; - so stop waiting!! should i return the product? 
(despite using it in and out for a week!); or just accept it and move on and enjoy my current ipad? 
(new ipad model) thank you
