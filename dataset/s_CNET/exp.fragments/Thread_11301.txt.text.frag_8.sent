i was considering a netbook primarily because of the size and weight advantages. 
my desktop is my primary machine, so i don't necessarily need a laptop to replace or substitute it with. 
as they say, the netbook would complement my desktop. 
i'd rather not lug around a six-pound laptop with a 15.6&quot; screen. 
you'd also have to carry around the power supply with one of those as well, whereas you wouldn't necessarily have to do that with a netbook that has a six-cell battery, making it an even more lightweight and compact solution.
