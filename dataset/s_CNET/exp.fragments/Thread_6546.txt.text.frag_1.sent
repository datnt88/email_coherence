hi all-- i have a dell dimension e520 that came with card readers and a dvd and one hd. i've added a second hard drive on sata port 4 and the original hd is sata0. the two are not raid enabled and i'd like them to be because i understand it would improve performance (which is why i added the second drive). 
i haven't been able to find instructions for enabling raid. 
can anyone give me step-by-step instructions, please? 
i think that the two drives need to be side-by-side ... sata4 and sata5 probably. 
many thanks!
