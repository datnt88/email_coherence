hi bob, thanks for the tip. 
i followed the guide (cleanup your grungy computer), updated chip set and bios, and tried to reinstall dwa-140 but word still hangs itself (which it didn't 2 minutes before installing the dwa-140). 
i tried to follow your steps in the event viewer, but when i get to control panel - performance and maintenance - administration tools i just get a desktop.ini 
file - there is nothing else! is there something missing in my xp version...? any suggestions on how to restore whatever tools should be under administration tools? 
thanks!
