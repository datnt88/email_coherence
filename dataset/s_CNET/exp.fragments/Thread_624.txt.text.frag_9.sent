says the graphics on that one is evga nforce 650i ultra is that as good as an 8800gt or so? also 400 bucks is alot better than what i was going to spend at ibuypower.com it was going to come with speakers, mouse, and a keyboard. 
all that with what i listed in my first post came to a bit over 800, with shipping 900. 
but i suppose if money is the problem here, i could just buy the pc and use the speakers/mouse/keyboard i have now and gradually upgrade.
