gee, kinda hard for me to say, but i noticed no one else said anything today to you. 
my wife uses a 4 year old emachine with integrated graphics on occasions to surf the net. 
intel has changed the terminology since then to intel extreme graphics, intel extreme graphic 2, and now the latest intel integrated gma 900. 
with the wife emachine using a crt monitor, i can tell the color sharpness/clarity is a little less than my two other computers with nvidia geforce graphic cards (crt monitors). 
i also noticed improvement in color and sharpness when i upgrade to higher cost graphic cards. 
if you can spare $$ it is worth looking into. 
some other comments i just made concerning 'integrated graphics' here
