i used the ati and hauppauge cards for the capture step with the audio plugged into my pc's audio line-in jack. 
after the capture i used ulead.com's 
(demos are there) for the video to dvd creation. 
the downside to this is that you can count on 6 to 10 hours of work for each 1 hour of dvd. 
not that you sit there for each hour, but that's the usual time it takes for the pc. bob
