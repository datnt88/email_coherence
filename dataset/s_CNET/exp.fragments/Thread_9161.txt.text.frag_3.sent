you didn't mention the true nature of files on the cd, are they compressed or as they're needed, uncompressed. 
regardless, see if you made a new dir. 
on your system and &quot;copy&quot; them to that dir.. manually, install the printer and point to either the cd or new dir. 
you made. 
if it fails on both attempts, then you probably have compressed files. 
get an &quot;uncompesser pgm&quot;, usually called that either a .zip 
.jar 
.arc, 
etc. if that what the files maybe compressed as by using winrar, winzip, etc. similar for such usage. 
also, older install pgms. 
may ask for disk1, disk2, check to see if such is present. 
if none of this makes sense, then just get the install(driver) files from the hp support website for that model printer. 
here is a link to start that process... select the os you need it for and follow prompts. 
good luck -----willy
