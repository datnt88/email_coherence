i ordered my customized dell almost 2 years ago (with warranty of course for that large of a purchase). 
after being told it would arrive in 7-10 days i was prepared to give it 10+. it arrived in 2 days. 
when i wanted to get the setup discs (not included to prevent those who don't know what they're doing, constantly installing and re-installing the os?) i used dell chat. the individual in india spoke better english than any 'tech' i've ever dealt with. 
i received my software in 2 days. 
i had to once again call dell support to replace my psu yesterday (under warranty) and was told to expect a technician with the parts in 2 days. 
he arrived this morning about 11:45. 
how's that for service? 
seriously, i have no complaints about dell products, or their support. 
i was shocked at the quick and thorough support i received. 
*whispers* i do believe i'll get another dell desktop soon..and i'll customize it as well for some uber-gaming!!
