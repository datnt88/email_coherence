are no longer touched by most repair shops. 
the care and feeding of the cpu is well known so i won't write any words about heatsinks or compound as you can google that. 
but if the machine just needs to get more life i find disabling the l1 and l2 cache to cure random crashes at the expense of speed. 
it's sad to read you have yet to refresh the heatsink compound.
