...sounds like maybe your ip address needs to be refreshed. 
from the dos prompt try the following; type &quot;ipconfig/renew&quot; (without the quotes) see if getting a new ip address helps also, try unplugging the modem, wait for about 30 seconds and then replugging the modem and rebooting. 
are you using a router, by the way?
