didn't your new burner come with it's own software? 
when i got my burner, it came with a nero disc that was, supposedly, only for that particular burner. 
do you know what burn engine is being used? 
just a couple of ideas: 1 check out taskmanager and see if incd is running 2 if know what the old burn engine is called goto run in your start menu and type msconfig and edit your startup menu. 
you might have a whole bunch of things running that aren't really needed. 
3 failing that get a startup editor like geeksuperhero, or tuneup utilities, or spybot or anything you can find on the net to edit which burn engines start when you boot up your pc. 4 try other cd/dvd burning programs. 
good luck!
