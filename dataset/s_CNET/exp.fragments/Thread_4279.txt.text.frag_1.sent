so, i'm needing to update my bios for my new cpu (amd fx 8350 4.0 ghz) to be able to run fully. 
the problem is, when i go to the website to download an update, i just get a .cap 
file. 
i've tried updating it with that file but ez flash says no. so i was on the look out for a .cap to .rom converter, turns out that is what i needed and they gave a list to all of their converters but none was for my model of mobo (which is a m5a99x evo r2.0) please help with this, i've been at it for at least 4 hours and i have had no luck with any other forums. 
thank you in advance.
