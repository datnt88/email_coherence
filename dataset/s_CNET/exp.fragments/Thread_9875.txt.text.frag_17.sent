what did you mean by &quot;what do we find inside these machines&quot; bob? 
ibm mainframes have a purpose built processor chip and i/o subsystem plus a unique operating system and clustering technology - z/os or its predecessor os/390. 
sun servers run solaris and are typically sparc based although a lot of amd has been seen recently. 
it is not about hareware anyway. 
it is more about the capabilities of the operating system and any middleware that exploits a specific os. 
infact it is the whole integrated package - hw, sw, i/o, etc - that sets the mainframe apart from a commodity wintel or lintel outfit. 
these are more like lego and the poor stressed systems admin guy is responsible for glueing the different vendor sourced parts together. 
it might be cheap ..... but you pays your money and ........
