i still think you are missing the point. 
besides the encryption, the iphantom provides the easiest gateway antivirus, spyware, adware, network intrusion prevention that i have ever used. 
coupling it with my software antivirus gives me all around protection. 
as far as the encryption part, i know from talking to them that each device is programmed with a unique key. 
besides making my data private, it keeps data sniffers and other people from communicating directly with my broadband connection. 
and they manage all of that for me. 
if you look at the big picutre, it is worth it. 
if you've ever dealt with gateway protection (antivirus, etc.) you'd know its expensive and can be complicated. 
i do network security administration and at first was skeptical like you were. 
i tried it and was happy to find that it actually works.
