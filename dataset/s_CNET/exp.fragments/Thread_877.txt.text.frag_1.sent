i've been tracking these threads to try and get a handle on the best way to back up my music collection. 
i currently have almost 50 gigs and plan to add more from my cd and album collections. 
my windows media player stopped working, so i'm dealing with that as well as looking to buy a new computer to replace my pentium 4. at the moment, my music files are all intact. 
i've been backing up everything on a 350 gig wd external hard drive, but after reading all the negative stuff about externals, i'm at a loss. 
should i buy one or two more externals and keep copies in two locations? 
is on-line storage reliable in the long run? 
any suggestions would be much appreciated!
