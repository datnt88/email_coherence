i would probably consider having my brother purchase a dell pc through dell's small business division for me through his company if i could be assured that all future tech support sessions on any future dell computer purchased from dell's small business division would be as smooth and hassle free as my session was a few nights ago with dell's small business division's tech support rep based in alabama. 
tech support; although some don't consider it to be very important; although i might get lucky and never need it; it's something very important to me to have good tech support with whichever vendor i myself would decide to purchase from and especially being able to also deal with someone who won't create or cause any language barrier problems to add to any frustration that i might encounter when dealing with any computer company's tech support. 
thanks for your comments.
