well i know for sure that my psu is powerful enough because it is 500w. 
i have no problems besides the dell loading screen being corupt and the odd flashes after closing a full screen app. it works fine in games and everything else. 
ill look into updating the bios. 
im thinking of also checking the harddrive through chkdsk to see if it finds anything.
