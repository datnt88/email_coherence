but wouldn't a kick or a strike make for one circle, crack, scuff or whatever? 
unless it was hit twice, why would there suddenly be two distinct circles? 
i don't mean to keep flogging a dead horse, but this laptop was brand-new and i treated it like a newborn -- i find it really hard to believe that it received any sort of shock whatsoever, especially one that could have damaged it while closed and in the case. 
had i knocked it around, checked it as baggaage or left it unattended, i could accept that it was damaged -- what leads me to believe it's defective instead of damaged is the very care i gave it. is there really no other possible cause for these circles? is it possible that a sony laptop is that fragile?
