i plug the flash drive into the pc and it reads &quot;usb device&quot; but when i look for the drive letter it doesn't exist. is there a way to turn on drive letters for external devices? the cd-rom shows as d: but the usb doesn't automatically turn up as any letter. 
i can see the flash drive in the device manager but i don't see the letter.
