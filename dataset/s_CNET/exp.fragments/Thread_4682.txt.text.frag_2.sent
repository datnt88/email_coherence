this is frequently due to the gears inside getting jammed or off track. 
in the front of the drive is a very small hole, big enough to put in a straigtened paperclip. 
put one in and it will push the drawer out and open. 
sometimes opening and reclosing it will fix the problem with it ejecting, other times you just trash it and buy a replacement...since they are in the $25 range these days.
