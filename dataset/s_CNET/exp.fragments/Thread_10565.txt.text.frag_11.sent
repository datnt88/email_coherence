by the way, the &quot;liquid lense&quot; if ordered via their website, is only $9.98 and shipping is a couple bucks....not the $5.00+ some places charge. 
i got my shippment for $11.90......... they only ship in the usa at the moment. 
use the left over for sunglasses, goggles, face masks, your watch case....anything with a scratched surface.
