1. get what you like. 2. or copy others. 
my favorite printer is the hp k550 line. 
built for office use, the paper handling is amazing. 
print speed is great and for me the printing costs are not more than average. 
my next favorite printer is any hp laser. 
bw printing may be dull but it is cheap.
