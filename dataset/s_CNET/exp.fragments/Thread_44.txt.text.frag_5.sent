well it doesn't have any ide slots, at least not that i can see. 
so i guess i need an adapter now? 
and that the current hard drive, which you can see, is connected with sata? 
from a quick google search i found these: i'm assuming something along those lines would be adequate. 
of course i don't want to buy an adapter and find out it's the wrong kind.
