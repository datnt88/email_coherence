well, what kind of computer are you running? 
tell me the motherboard and processor if you please. 
this would help a lot. 
i currently had a similar problem with my comptuer. 
xp would work fine, except that i'd get a random reboot every so often, usually when i played games or ran many programs. 
i'm running an old athlon t-bird slot a @ 850mhz on a amd 750 chipset. 
come to find out, it was a simple setting in the bios - the &quot;super bypass mode&quot;. 
once i changed it to &quot;disabled&quot;, it fixed the problem and now i don't get the random reboots anymore. 
also, may i remind you that i'm running this on a 250w atx psu, the one that came with my other computer (i just swapped out mobo and processor). 
i've been running with this psu for over 4 years with no problems, and all with: dvd drive, cdrw drive, 80gb hd, 512mb ram, 3 pci cards (sound, ethernet, and usb ports), and a geforce2 mx400. 
not to mention, also 4 auxillary fans...1 intake, 1 fan for the gfx card, 1 blower under the gfx card, and 1 more for outtake behind the processor. 
that's what you call reliability!! i recently tried running my pc on 400w psus, but they couldn't take the power drain (do not buy those cheap $15 psus, no matter how much w they take. 
they're worthless and a waste of money).
