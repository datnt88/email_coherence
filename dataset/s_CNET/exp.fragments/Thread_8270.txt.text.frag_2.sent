all the major brands are good, really your choice. 
swapping the drive can be easy or a nightmare. 
the new drive should come with cloning software which will make an exact copy of the old drive onto the new drive. 
but if the old drive is failing this may not be possible. 
if it works, you're done. 
next choice is a full reinstall of the os. just pop the xp cd into the drive and start from scratch, but you'll need drivers for sound, video, usb, etc. since no os will contain these.
