ati has an adpter that plugs into the output of a vga card a converts the rgb to componet. 
yes if your tv has a dvi conector you can use that. the ati hdtv wonder card works very good on xpsp2, with xpmce there are some problems getting it working corectly. 
xpmce won't use the analog tuner in the hd card, but will use the analog tuner in your all in wonder tv card and the hd tuner in the hd card. 
wiht ota hdtv you need a good strong signal. 
her is alink with lots of info on htpc.
