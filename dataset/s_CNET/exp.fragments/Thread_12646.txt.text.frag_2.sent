why? less dropouts, less lag, more reliable. 
and the time has passed where i used to skip usb sticks. 
why not something like i use? 
example at link. 
it's about 10 bucks and on windows 7 i don't have to find the drivers. 
and even if it notes 54 megabit, the sticks i've received are n compatible.
