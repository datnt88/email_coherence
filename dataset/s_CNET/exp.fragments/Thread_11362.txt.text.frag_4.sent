i have got a similar set up as yours and the same problem. 
i can't see a computer through my network neighbourhood, although i can ping it. 
it used to work before, but for some reason has stopped working lately. 
i have tried restarting both the computers, but it still doesn't work. 
each of the computers can see themselves in the network but they can't see each other. 
can someone help
