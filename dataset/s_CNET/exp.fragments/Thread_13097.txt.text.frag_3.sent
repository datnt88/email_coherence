the toshiba is connected via dvi-hdmi cable. the desktop is extended onto this monitor, rather than cloned so i can still use the computer while watching movies. 
the problem persists whether i list the toshiba as the primary or secondary monitor. 
i've tried playing around with the video card settings before posting without success. 
i do not know how to change the frequency on the toshiba. 
i've checked the manual and did a web search without getting any info.
