this is another reason why i have 3 copies. 
if these were trustworthy i could live with one spare copy. 
about dvd. 
since these are cheap enough i can make new ones, file them away and always put the date on them so i can sort the backups by date. 
if you want an easier way, look into online backup offerings.
