seems to point to memory issues. 
in fact you did that and it did fix it for a short time which tells you it was that. 
it is possible that the motherboard has developed a failure but it is still a memory or memory controller type failure. 
--&gt; what confused me is how did you run memtest if it fails to boot and have no visual?
