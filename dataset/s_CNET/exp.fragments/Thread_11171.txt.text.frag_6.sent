1. i have removed the firewall 2. i have not changes the wpa2/wpa to just wpa2 because one of my wireless cards doesnn't connect if it's just wpa2. 
3. i have moved a small obsturction out of the routers way. 
i am now getting a bit better internet speed. 
just as a comparison, if i am sitting next to the router the speed of the internet is above 20mbps, but in a room upstairs (router is downstairs) i am now getting about 3.5 mbps, so ideally i would like to get up to atleast 10 mbps is the upstairs room.
