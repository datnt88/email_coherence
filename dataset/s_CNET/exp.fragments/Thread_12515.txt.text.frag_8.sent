silly as it was, i had forgotten to mention that yes, i checked my motherboard's manufacturer website regarding the proper codecs. 
yes, i had installed the &quot;microsoft uaa&quot; bus driver first (after removing my pre-existing real tek '97/c-media cmi9880 driver configurations) followed by installing the c-media function driver provided specifically from that particular web-page. 
that didn't work, unfortunately. 
that's when i attempted the scenario described in my first post. 
yes, to clarify i have three sound set-ups on my computer: -my soundblaster card. 
-my motherboard's onboard speaker ports (at the back of the pc) -the front audio panel built into my case all three worked correctly pre-format. 
i simply selected whichever configuration i felt like using from the sound & audio devices playback tab under control panel. 
i never had cause to use the motherboard's onboard rear speaker ports, so i didn't mention it earlier. 
now, my choices are limited to just the rear built-into-the-motherboard speaker ports, and my sound-blaster ports. 
i normally use my sound-blaster card for sound output. 
when i don't wish to disturb anyone with the noise from my speakers, i use(d) headphones plugged into the front audio panel. the front audio panel is not connected to the sb card. 
it is connected to a specific set of pins on the motherboard available for that purpose (that is, for the purpose of hooking up computer tower/case front audio panels to this motherboard). the pins are clearly labelled as such in the schematic displayed in my motherboard's manual, and i have plugged the pins for grounding, right and left speakers, etc into their respectic sockets. 
nothing has changed in the wiring since pre-format, when all three configurations worked correctly.
