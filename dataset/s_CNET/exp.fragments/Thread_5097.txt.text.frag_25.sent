i have this hp and love it! 
i have hooked up red-white-yellow cables from my tv setup (vhs, dvd and dvr) to the front inputs on the computer. 
i then record using muvee. 
i have also used muvee to transfer home movies through the front firewire input. 
it is then very easy to burn to dvd. 
btw i highly recommend videoredo to strip commercials from recorded tv before burning to dvd.
