i have two printers: brother mfc-3820cn & epson stylus photo r300 and have used compatible cartridges in both printers for over two years and have not experienced any problems with either printer because of using a compatible. 
i have used the same on-line company/supplier for those two years and am very happy with the service and their products; all of which i would rate excellent! 
their website is: and the company is located in tigard, oregon. 
check it out--i'm sure you will be glad you did.
