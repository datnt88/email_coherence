i bought a new dell computer and lcd monitor on ebay for a price that i couldn't get it for on the dell website. 
it arrived in perfect condition. 
after a week, the hard drive stopped working. 
so, i called dell and they sent out a tech person to replace the hard drive and it all was covered under their warranty. 
the person i bought it from had purchased it under some discount program available only to educational institutions and then used all of the rebates to get the puter for a price that isn't available to the general public. 
i got a great deal, he made a little money and everyone is happy. 
it is just frustrating to see someone abuse the educational discount system that dell so generously makes available. the computer and monitor were packaged in the original dell packaging and arrived in great condition. 
boxes weren't damaged nor was the monitor.
