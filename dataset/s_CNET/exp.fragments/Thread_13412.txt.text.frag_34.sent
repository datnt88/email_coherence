when i consider places to eat or drink, especially during the daytime, i gravitate toward places with free internet. 
usually the connections are slow, but fast enough to get emails, and do some light browsing, including occasional youtube etc.. in short, having free internet is very likely adding revenue because people remember that you have it and will come back to enjoy your pub, and some social networking etc.. i realize it's a cost, but i can virtually assure you that offering the service is adding to your bottom line! 
all you need to do is work out a balance of profitability and cost, and then rest easy that offering the service is adding to your profits! 
good luck!
