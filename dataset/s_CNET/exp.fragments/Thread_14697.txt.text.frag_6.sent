almost no one uses ecc memory these days, the chance is one in many million that you will ever benefit from it's error correction. 
it is capable of correcting single bit errors which are usually caused by being bombarded by cosmic rays/noise, an extremely rare situation. 
now it could also correct memory errors caused by bad memory, but in that case you are going to need to replace the memory anyway. the only time ecc is really needed is with mission critical servers.
