with the failure of the first drive like i said before ..... he bad news about raid 0 is and i quote....&quot;the failure of just one drive will result in all data in an array being lost.&quot; 
you indicated one drive died and you restored the os to the working drive. 
sorry for the bad news ...perhaps someone else will see a solution i missed.
