let me add my two cents. 
i'm pretty sophisticated about computers and periphery and my children and grandchildren rely on my assistance. 
my daughter bought three compaq prosario computers for herself and children (my grandchildren). 
the computers came with as a package with visioneer5800 scanners and xp home installed. 
all worked fine until the warranty period ran out (of course). 
then we started getting the message ''unlock scanner''. 
at one point, i got one of the scanners to work by moving it to another machine. 
that worked for about a month, then the error re-appeared. 
i then uninstalled, deleted, cleaned the registry, etc.--everything the visioneer website insisted on--downloaded and reinstalled the drivers. 
worked fine. 
for one day. 
then stopped. 
called the 900 number for tech support, paid them the lousy $4 a minute for support. 
after 5 minutes, was told it was a hardware problem. 
all three scanners! 
hung up the phone in disgust (i didn't believe them, but what could i do?), went out and bought an epson scanner for my grandchilden, and it works fine. 
from the discussion, a couple of ideas occur: (1) as they age, the voltage output of the power units might be dropping. 
new power units might work. 
(2) somehow, one of the microsoft updates is conflicting with the visioneer drivers and visioneer won't fix the drivers. 
i would appreciate hearing if anyone else ever figures our the solution. 
i would hook up the old visioneer scanner to one of the grandchildren's computers--i would use it if i could fix it, but would not buy another product from this compnay.
