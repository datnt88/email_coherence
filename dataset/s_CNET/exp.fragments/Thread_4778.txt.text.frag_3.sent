well i'm not quite sure what you mean when you say that my &quot;ip plan&quot; needs to be good. 
i have read so many forum posts and tried most all of them i think at this point and i know i'm probably just doing one little silly thing wrong. 
trouble is, so many of the posts (even with the same hardware and isp) give different account. 
i'm not able to single out a pattern and thus where i'm going wrong. 
i looked at the sticky as well and it didn't help me much. 
this is where i am. i reset the modem and router, powered down everything and am now sitting with a xp laptop connected directly to the westell 6100 set in pppoe configuration and i have a connection. 
now then, what's my next move? 
some have said change to bridge protocol with &quot;routed bridge&quot;, set to private lan and disable all dchp on the modem. 
next i was told to fire up the linksys (wrt54g v2 with the latest firmware) and set it to dchp, letting it automatically assign ip addresses (i assume). 
still nothing. 
when i run ipconfig/release and then /renew i get the gateway as 192.168.1.1 with the ip being 192.168.1.15 (the ip i instructed it to begin with). 
so based on all of this i gather that its only looking at the lan and not getting anything from the wan (and by extension, the modem). 
after this i try changing the (linksys) router to pppoe mode but when i try to connect it tells me the pppoe server cannot assign an ip. i know you are without a doubt a busy person who takes a great deal of what i can only assume is your personal time to respond to strangers' forum queries. 
i thank you for that as well as any assistance you can offer me in resolving my troubles. 
best, alex
