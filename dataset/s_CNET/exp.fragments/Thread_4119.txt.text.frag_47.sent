fly by visitor i think hit it right on the button. 
i did'nt have this problem until i switched from charter (which kicked me of line 5 times a hour or more) thats enought to po anybody, they refuse to replace the line to my house from the early 80's when cable first came out. 
now i have at&t-dsl, i don't get kicked off, but my you tube or any other video's i try to watch is choppy or froze. 
i removed my ati 9250/512 mb. video card and installed geforce mx440 same problem. 
in which tells me it's not computer but my dsl to my basement with not enought bandwith to go 60 ft.with cat5. 
my wife upstairs and my daughter have no problem. 
i have 1 ea. 3 ft. 
and 1 ea. 4 ft. of parallel and 3 intersections @ 120v. 
power line. 
either my parallel is to close to the 120v. 
to reflect a magnetizem field or i got a poor service that can't bump the mb. service. 
tomorrow i&quot;m calling at&t and find out wusup! 
how much they can they do for me to keep me as a loyal customer. 
listen up everybody &quot;if you got money(cash)&quot; it walks and talks. 
you have &quot;with cash&quot; the upper hand. 
you have the bargin power, they can't sell they don't eat. 
my dad's proverbs from the 30's and that's almost where we are at.
