i've been researching different tablets for enjoying media/social networking and i was originally only looking to pay 200 for a tablet. 
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;after learning more, i understand that price is definatley a factor in production value, survivabilty, and usability.so 
now i'm looking for the best that i can &lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;i need something that will last me a while i would appreciate is if it had could fuction as a calendar, to do list, skype, and use internet. 
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;i live in the usa
