i have earthlink broadband through time warner cable. 
i will try to locate a good hotspot to see if i get anything there. 
thanks guys. 
i'll also look for a reset, but i have unplugged everything, given it time to reset, and plugged it back in, but same same. 
i'll update again once i hit a hotspot.
