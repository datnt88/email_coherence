mp3 being a lossy compression tends to lose its luster at standard bitrates you see used by 99% of us. the brilliance you speak of is only noticed on great speakers. 
try this on your current setup. 
play the cd version or better yet some hidef audio recording and then compare that version to your mp3 (or other) recording.
