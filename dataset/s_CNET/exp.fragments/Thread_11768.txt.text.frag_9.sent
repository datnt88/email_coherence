i thought something didnt quite seem right. 
i just looked at the intel cpu that i was thiking about getting and it's a lga775 socket cpu. 
i was looking at a 3.2 ghz prescott core p4 chip so that might be something esle to watch for. 
i'd look for at least a p4 530 chip or higher. 
the 3.2 is a 540 chip. 
they do run very warm though so if you go with a prescott core cpu be sure you've got good case cooling. 
especially if you're running a video card that generates much heat. 
dont know about the dvd recording. 
my guess would be it would hold the same as with audio but i'm not sure. 
wahtever the case though either make of cpu given a high enough speed will do the job nicely. 
meaning an amd 3500+ will do the job nicely as will a p4 of the same speed. 
if you're going to be doing audio work, i'd recommend getting a quality sound card, which will take a pci slot. 
i've got an audigy 2 zs gamer and it's an excellent card. 
unless you've got a good reason to go micro-atx i'd probably go standard atx form. 
gives you more room to work inside the case and more room for heat dissipation too if you do go with a prescott cpu. 
as fro boards; umm, i guess head to newegg and search for boards that are socket lga775 compatible. 
then look at the form factor(atx, m-atx). the chipset is somewhat hard to nail down for me currently. 
i think the newest chipset from intel at least is the 915 series. 
i was looking at a 915p chipset. 
if you can find a board that supports it, it might be worth investing in dual channel ddr too. 
i'm a bit fuzzy on how it works but it gives you roughly a 10% increase in performance vs single channel ddr. 
pc3200 is the absolute min that you should go for. 
i'd look into at least ddr433 or ddr500 and initially have at least a gig of it. 
and yea an 800mhz fsb is very important to have so the fsb isnt the choke point on the computer.
