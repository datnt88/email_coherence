before you think it, no, i haven't formatted my hard drive or anything like that. 
somehow i have manged to break in half one of the components on the chipboard on the base of the hard drive, it is a samsung sp0802n. 
will i be able to swap the chip board from another drive? 
(not of same make or model) or would this be a bad idea? 
or should i contact samsung for help? 
or would it be possible to take apart the hard drive and swap the disk over with another hard drive of equal capacity? 
help much apreciated.
