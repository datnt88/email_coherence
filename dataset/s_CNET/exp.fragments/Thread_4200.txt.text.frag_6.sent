the system run a little faster. 
however, ram and hard drives are not related in any way. 
i believe that you are confusing the two. 
now if your computer had run adequately fast at one time, and has slowed down, the isue is much more likely to be caused by spyware, malware, viruses, trojans.

just search for those related to the computer running slower. 
if you provide the answers to what robert proffitt is indicating that we need, we could tell you whether there is any chance that ram is your issue.
