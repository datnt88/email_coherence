i have yet to get a 100% or reliable recovery rate with any s/w. 
no amount of playing gets it all done, though some files may have been recovered it seems its never the one critial one the user needs. 
below is a google webpage: robert, usually has a small listing he always posts, but i have no direct cnet link to it. 
i suggest you search here on forum for it, as data recovery is a hot topic too often associated with ext. 
hds. the lesson here is also store data on cd/dvd discs as well for critial data as yet another storage source.
