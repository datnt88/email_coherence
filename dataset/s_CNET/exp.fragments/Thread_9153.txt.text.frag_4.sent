and also i would e-mail asus support and ask the question of them. 
i'm sorry i don't know the answer to your question. 
intel support and forums may also have an answer. 
i also tend to use google like a person and ask specific questions with sometimes very good results. 
almost always i find it gets me to forum discussions similar to what i'm trying to find out. 
glad the suggestions helped a bit.
