why are rear ports to be preferred over their front counterparts? 
it has to do with the wiring used. 
for years i've encountered issues with front ports. 
to avoid this i use the rear ports when there is trouble. 
sorry but it's late so i'll stop here and not answer why the industry is in a fine mess.
