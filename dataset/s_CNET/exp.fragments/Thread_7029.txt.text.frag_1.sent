i am using a windows xp professional computer. 
i just bought the microsoft wireless optical desktop 1000 to replace the same set. 
the set contains a wireless mouse and a wireless keyboard. 
when i move the cursor to the right edge of the screen with the mouse, the cursor will often will move on its own to a different place on the screen. 
i tried adjusting some of the settings in the mouse properties screen but that didn't seem to help. 
what could be causing this problem and how do i fix it? 
thanks.
