bob, i finally got tweakui installed. 
my problem was i didn't realize it had to be installed to it's own download folder to end up in the control panel. 
i see tweakui has alot of little goodies. 
it appears now i can sometimes tweak w/o being afraid of the messing up the registry. 
thanks for your help. 
have a great day.
