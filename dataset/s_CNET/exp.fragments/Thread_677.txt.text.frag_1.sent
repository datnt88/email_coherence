i am buying a macbook pro with a ss hard drive (which is small), it has the nvidia 1gb graphics card. 
i want to play many video games which require windows, but most of these games take up quite a bit of space so i do not want to run bootcamp on the mac ss. is it possible to take an external hard drive format the entire thing as a windows 7 system and run this hard drive as an alternate with my computer for the use of video games? 
also, i have usb 3.0 so it seems this would be the best connection for speed and price, am i right in thinking this? 
thanks in advance
