i have never heard of using a vacuum cleaner to blow the dust away would be harmful. 
also i have never seen a case where glue are use for the side panel (some detail is missing here), i probably would go with epoxy. 
as for usb 3.0, see what connection is available on the computer then get a usb3 adapter for it. 
i would think pcie 4 or 16 or sata connection should do it.
