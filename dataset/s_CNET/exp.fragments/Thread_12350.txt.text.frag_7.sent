it is true there's always some risk with any pc components. 
but with regard to internal vs. external hard drives, it's clear to me the risk is much much higher with usb externals vs internals. 
to wit, just read the many problem posts in the storage and pc hardware forums. 
actually i do have several external hdds which i use to backup my primary (internal) backup. 
when the externals aren't in use for backup, they are not plugged in. 
i take the externals to work whenever i don't forget. the other thing i always use and advocate use of a good ups to protect pc systems. 
wishing you better luck in the future.
