i would like to get a samsung sata 18xdvd+r dvd burner w/12x dvd-ram write and lightscribe. 
i have a 4 yr old pc amd and would like to know if a sata is compatible or should i use a ide? 
i use xp windows. 
i have added additonal ram card earlier, have lots of ram. 
i think the card was a ide. 
i never had a dvd player in this yet but there is an update slot and connections for one. 
i understand this is an oem plug and play and looks easy to install for this novice on dvd's. 
i also have the nero burning program already i use with my cd burner, will that be compatible with a dvd player like this. 
thank you for any help.
