e-machines conveniently lists only a $20 tech support line, and after many e-mail correspondances with support, they still would not give out a (customer service number). 
so basically they just hope you'll go away! 
unless any one has a better way to get their attention, it looks like i will have to get a motherboard. 
are their any brands which stand out over the rest, and would upgrading to a faster speed comb. 
board be a difficult transition?
