i'm a little wary of getting a 6800gt. 
i keep reading reviews on newegg for several different manufacturers and it seems people either say it performs great, or they say they have a ton of problems with it, there isn't a lot of middle ground. 
cooling these things seems to be an issue too, and while i won't have a problem putting on an aftermarket cooler, i don't exactly want to do that, then have the card crap out, then be stuck with no video card due to voiding my warranty! 
i can't afford it. 
i might go with a 7800
