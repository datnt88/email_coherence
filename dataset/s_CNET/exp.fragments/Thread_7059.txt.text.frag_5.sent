should be focusing on is the graphic card, not the processor. 
the weakness of an all-in-one is (just like a laptop) is that what you got is what you got. if you buy a game and your machine doesn't have enough graphic punch to run it, you're stuck. 
if you are dead set on getting an all-in-one, the dell xps one for $1800 is probably your best bet.
