i tried everything that is talked about here and it worked great, i can watch my dish network programming on my tv and record. 
as for your tuner card, i tried hauppauge 1196 wintv hvr-1250 pci express hybrid high definition tv tuner card and it worked great. 
i dont know if that is the version you tried but good luck.
