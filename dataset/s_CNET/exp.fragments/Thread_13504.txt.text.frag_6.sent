thanks for all the great info guys! 
i'm still kind of confused though. 
i have the manual that came with the motherboard right in front of me and it shows to use the connections i said in the original post. 
i don't see anything else in it where it shows a different set of connectors for front panels. 
thanks for your help though, i'll look again
