because if you take a look at the power macs and pros, you'll notice that you just have to stick a drive in them and go. 
of course an ibook isn't the same, but same principle in a way... lol. 
i've never even heard of updating hd firmware for computers, but my pcs are from the pentium era, so there's not much to work with. 
i would think that once you install the system, the ibook will do everything it needs to for you. 
what hd are you upgrading from? 
my mbp has a 120gb hd, and i find it to be a tad small, though i haven't used up half of it... yet. 
surely it can go a bit bigger, but maybe 120gb is plenty for you. 
i have never owned an ibook but the g4 models are still pretty good, considering that a lot of the good ones were produced a little over two years ago. 
i've seen a friend's ibook and he just loves it. 
too bad he got it the day before the macbook came out lol . 
cheers.
