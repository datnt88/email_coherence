you may have trouble finding one to write or speak to in english. 
and to cross the gulf of a medical issue to the monitor selection is going to be difficult. 
i agree you should elicit your medical doctor's help on solving this one.

as per title, look at where such things are made now. 
such things are not made in most english-speaking countries now.
