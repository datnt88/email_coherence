i agree, considered and mentioned another solution for that problem. 
not throttling the entire bandwidth as some suggested, but throttling individual user bandwidth. 
throttling the entire connection defeats having a larger bandwidth. 
throttling individual user logins allows everyone to enjoy as much internet access as their access level permits (this suggests that &quot;special access&quot; could be granted to a user for a specific situation. 
the thing that should be considered. 
do not over complicate the affair. 
use what is needed and kiss!!! (keep it simple stupid) this is a simple problem that only requires a simple solution. 
over-complicating the thing is a flag for impassioned pioneers of hacking. 
it is a challenge! 
something to defeat. 
(and most of the kids out there have some pretty good tools (other people wrote for other good purposes, as well as specialty hacker tools) be secure, but don't make yourself a target.
