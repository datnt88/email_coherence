xp pro and ie 7 my dear old mom (87) has terrible tremors and has a very difficult time lining up the cursor to click a link etc. she exchanges emails with friends and family daily. 
i know how to slow the mouse down, but that isn't really the problem. 
her hand jerks around so much that hard to line up at any speed. 
i'm thinking maybe a sandbag on her wrist. 
anyways, pc mag feb edition lists logitech nulooq as one of 20 best innovations. 
it's i think 1 lb hockey puck-size device made to use with a mouse. 
has anyone tried one of these? 
i'm thinking the weight of the device would be helpful. 
can it open emails etc? hope that i've made myself clear for a change. 
any any other suggestions very welcome.
