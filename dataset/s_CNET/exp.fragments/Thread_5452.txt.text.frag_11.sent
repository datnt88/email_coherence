sorry, haven't dealt with chipset info, i think it's the firmware that you are asking for, but just in case i listed the rest of the info: intel 82801ba lpc interface controller -2440 82801ba/bam smbus controller -2443 82801ba/ca pci bridge -244e 82802 firmware hub device 82850 processor to i/o controller -2530 82850/82860 processor to agp controller -2532 even if i have to reinstall without the hdcard, i'd appreciate this info, as i'm thinking it'll be a good idea to update whatever's outdated anyways. 
thanks.
