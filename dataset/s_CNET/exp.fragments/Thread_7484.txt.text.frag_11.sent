thanks, bill. 
i think i'll be able to manage this, so to speak. 
getting the n router to be managed via the wan port is the only thing that worries me a little, but i assume i'll find this option somewhere. 
and i'm pretty familiar with the dhcp table on my g router (i use it to see what all the devices i have connected are -- amazing how a little home network can grow until you have 10 or 12 things all attached). 
once again, i thank you for all the help and wish me luck (my fall back position is to return the n router and just run cable through the attic -- much simpler in practice but not nearly as versatile as i continue to add devices :&gt;)
