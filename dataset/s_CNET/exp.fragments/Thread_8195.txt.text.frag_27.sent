they won't fix it since the devices: a. generate no income (except for those phone calls.) b. the devices have reached the end of their service life. 
everyone wants them to last 10 years. 
here's an analogy. 
let's say you buy an add-on for your car. 
a few years pass and then you replace the car. the device now fails. 
does anyone fix it for free now? 
this is what we ask for when we want the drivers fixed for the newer os. drivers are not cheap and the code monkeys demand to be fed and paid. 
if you won't feed or pay the code monkeys, you won't get your drivers. 
unless you run linux, but that's another system.
