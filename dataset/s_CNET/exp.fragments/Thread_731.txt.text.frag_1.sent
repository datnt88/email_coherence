i want to play simcity 4 on my machine but it wont work. 
after looking to aspyr tech support (online) it says i need a few requirements (upgrades): requirements: ati radeon or nvidia geforce card - i have aty rage m3 32 mb of vram - i have 8mb. 
500mhz - i have 400mhz - the least of my worries i don't mind slow game play. 
does anyone know if my old trusty powerbook can accept these upgrades and approx what would cost be? 
any help would be greatly appreciated. 
thank you for your time in advance. 
sincerely, lastg3interceptor
