this is truly the old timewarp issue. 
way back when those fpm machines were left in the dust when we moved to edo. the owners that &quot;invested&quot; in fpm sticks were miffed over the memory technology advances. 
anyhow, you see the &quot;maybe&quot; word here and there on this board. 
and again i think this is a don't do it machine. 
you can find better, for free on freecycle.
