it sounds to me that either the motherboard itself has a problem or your bios is corrupt.there are two avenues you can pursue since no amount of software,(such as installing xp),can fix a hardware problem.your 
bios can indeed cause virtually every problem you have described.you 
must find the model of the motherboard you have which is stamped on it somewhere.if 
you still have your original literature on it you may find it there.once 
you determine your motherboards model you can then go to their site and download an updated bios.most of the manufacturers have instructions on how to flash your bios to update it.choose the latest version.if 
you don't feel comfortable trying to flash the bios,which cost nothing,you can actually purchase a new bios chip from biosworld that will come preprogrammed for 25.00.they 
give detailed instructions on their web site on how to remove the chip and install the new one which really is fairly easy.if 
you want to go all out you can replace the entire motherboard,processor and memory for around 150. to 200. and have virtually a new system.places that sell these parts are numerous on the internet and the procedure usually only takes a few hours even for newbies.if 
you still have the same problems after the bios is flashed,which i would try first,i would look into a new motherboard and cpu.
