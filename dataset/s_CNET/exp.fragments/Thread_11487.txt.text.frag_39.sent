dfichtner, my point was not about the strength, or lack of strength, of the wpa/psk scheme of security. 
i agree, with all bits being utilized, with random numbers and letters, it has not been proven to be broken, based on your criteria. 
by the same token, my point was that the average hacker will/can not make themselves vulnerable by sitting within 100-200 feet of your house, trying to break your key for hours at a time without being noticed. the average home user doesn't have data valuable enough to warrant that type of attack, and if they did, they wouldn't be using wireless, they would be using an ethernet cable, ipsec encrytion, and l2tp at the bare minimum. 
i just want people to use a little common sense along with there security. 
that's all i was trying to say. 
people don't make their homes into fort knox to protect their wife's $114.95 walmart gold charm.
