i did not read in prior posts that bd/br was functional. 
folk have systems that don't do this and i didn't know yours was ok. now all we have to be sure of is that the dvi ports note hdcp in the new cards. 
in short, the displays must have hdcp, the video cards must have hdcp and the bd player software have it's decoder, etc. bob
