the code 19 is the clue here. 
this code has been seen on other mice when the driver messed up. 
sadly some will want an exact fit when i supply a link. 
this may be possible but since this is all volunteer i limit my searches to close enough examples. 
-&gt; what i try next is to unplug all the mice and boot safe mode. 
try it with just one mouse and in safe mode head to the device manager and uninstall all mice found. 
on the next boot windows will redetect compatible mice and hopefully cures it. the logitech code 19 often resulted in reloading the os. and beyond the setpoint the mouse filter drivers were causing code 19 and other issues. 
that history is well, history. 
i learned to avoid installing such but let's think about today's malware. 
a keyboard+mouse logger could create this problem. 
it's why we can't discount malware.
