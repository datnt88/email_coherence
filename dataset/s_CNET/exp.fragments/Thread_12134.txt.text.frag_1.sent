i am in the market for a webcam. 
this will be my first. 
basically, i am looking for something simple to use with decent picture quality. 
i only plan to use it for video conversations via msn. 
this little number caught my eye recently on newegg: i gladly welcome any purchasing advice. 
especially in regards to what features i should look for and what would be a good compromise in terms of price and quality. 
many thanks in advance!
