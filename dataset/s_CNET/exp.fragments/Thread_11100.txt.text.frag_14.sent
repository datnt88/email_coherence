as i wrote in my last message, i had changed the address of (wired) router #2 to 192.168.2.100, and the access point to 192.168.2.99 - that is the strange thing. 
i checked it - with a wired connection into router #2 - and those addresses are correct. 
but turning them on somehow makes it impossible to log into router #1 at 192.168.2.1. 
a minor matter, since things work, but a mystery nonetheless. 
my main goal, accessing a (wired) network-addressable camera attached to (wired) router #2, works. 
thanks again for your time.
