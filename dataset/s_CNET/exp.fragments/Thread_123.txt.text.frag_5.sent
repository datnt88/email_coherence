it's really quite simple. 
you shouldn't have to change anything in the bios. 
i had a dell with a 40gb hard drive and i added a 120gb with no problem. the only thing to watch is how you actually connect the second drive. 
on my drive, the jumper pins were set for the &quot;cable select&quot; method. 
in fact, i don't think i even had to change the pins on the new drive since most use the cable select method now.
