if proper connections are made it should work. 
its important to review the manual and verify the connections are going to where they need to go. 
also, the frt. 
panel power-on/off harness si proper. 
you can remove the harness and using a small screwdriver or metal contact, short the contact for a split sec. 
and see if it powers-on. 
that way yu know at least the proper contact was active. 
next, check the video connection, if not on video car or on-board is connected, that way at least a flash may appear or not bit indicates power again is present. the monetarily flash you see1st powering-on is only the surge and means only power is present but not active(on?off) 
status. 
alas, not cables/harness need be connected, if all that are required are connected. 
new psus come ready for various setups and thus not all are needed. 
check and verify all is fully seated and ok, take your time. 
you need to make a simple(basic) system, only enough to power-on the system. 
if that doesn't work, again some connection isn't pressnt or misconnected. 
of course, if all else fails, you can then though the status of components being ok, swap and replace. 
google for bad caps or such and look for exmaples at -or- a troubleshooting chart giving ideas to check following the chart. 
you can't take anything for granted. 
if possible test compnets elsewhere. 
you didn't mention what wattage psu was, is it better than 400w and a decent name brand?
