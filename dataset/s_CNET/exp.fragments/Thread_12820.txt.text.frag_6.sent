permits. 
adding 2 1gb dimms in place the 2-256mb dimms would help considerably but will not add to your video ram unless it can be allocated to video ram thru the system bios. 
your system cannot run efficiently on 768mbs of ram (1024 mbs - 256mbs for video ram) as you're currently running. 
see how that does first and then if a separate video card (gpu) is still needed, then explore those options as recommended above at tomshardware.com. the only caution is to make sure your power supply (psu) is powerful enough to support the new video card as the higher end cards are power hungry too. 
let us know how it works out.
