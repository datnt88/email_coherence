i've never had to deal with whether my network adapter was an issue, so no, i didn't know of the fn+f2 function. 
i'm wondering if i made a mistake adding my laptop to my network, hence the &quot;duplicate name on the network&quot; message i always get at start up. 
my internet connection is so inconsistent with my laptop. 
can anyone give me a step by step understanding of figuring out what the problem is (whether it be my network adapter, router, etc). 
any words on my inability to have my router recognized by my laptop via an ethernet cable?
