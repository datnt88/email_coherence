okay, let me clear this up. 
yes, i really want to do this (unless it is just ridiculously expensive), no i can't just get a new computer. 
i have a modern computer. 
it is the family computer. 
the one i want to fix up is my computer. 
i use it for my music, and to play old computer games that are not compatible with the computers of today. 
i want to upgrade it so that it does these two things better, and so i can use to for any other off-line stuff i need to do. 
so, with that out of the way, i would be eternally grateful if someone would be so kind as to answer my question.
