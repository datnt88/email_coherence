thanks for all your replies, folks:) i'll try moving the pc to a new location and see if that helps re: mag interference jmarchi and willy. 
i've checked the plugs to make sure there's nothing disconnected. 
but the suggestion of reseating the video card is a good one, thanks islander. 
interestingly, denjones, i upped the refresh to 85mhz and it solved the prob for about a day and then i experience some more flickering, though not as often...
