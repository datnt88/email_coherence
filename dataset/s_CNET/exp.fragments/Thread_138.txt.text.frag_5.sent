no offence taken, ... the black wires are together. 
the front panel wires, hdd led,turbo led,reset led, turbo switch, reset switch, are not connected ... will this make a difference? 
if so i don't know where to put them. 
i need to know what motherboard i have(it's not on it)and without a bios code at boot, can't think how to id it. 
thanks for your help anyway, it's just a proccess of elimination i guess.
