i like the fact that you can get it in a 64gb model. 
i'd like it better if you could use usb otg without rooting the thing. 
there have been promises that bb 10 will fix that, but it's been a really long time coming. 
what scares me is that less than a month ago the rim ceo apparently wrote off the entire tablet pc market. 
(see ). i'm concerned that if i got myself a playbook, i'd wind up with an orphaned product. 
i have to say that it seems like a nice product on paper. 
rim must have just not known how to market it.
