i guess that's a no on the vista gpu. 
damn, i was really hoping to get a gpu now and sli it when vista came out. 
maybe i'll try a 6600 for a bit... i will try it with the two optical drives together and the hdd by itself since i'll most likely use the hdd more than the optical drives. 
the reason why i like both a dvd and dvd-rw drive is because i don't like taking my dvds to school. 
usually someone takes it and never returns it or returns it all scratched up. 
i really wish this hd was sata but $50 (after rebates) for a 300gb seagate was a hell of a deal. 
thanks guys.
