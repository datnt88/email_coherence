i bought a maxtor ata 160 gig hard drive to use in a usb enclosure as a receptacle for video files to make dvd's. 
i was able to format the drive thru accessories/system tools but am unable to gain the full 160 gigs. 
i know there is a 137 gig limit unless one has xp service pack one which i do have installed. 
the most i can get out of the new drive is about 39 gigs. 
any suggestions to find the other 121 gigs?
