thank you so much. 
i emailed them to see if they are available in the us. 
i have been surfing at amazon and overstock, and i had never seen such a deep assortment. 
good review. 
well i was impressed with the incipio ipad case, however i wanted to see what other ipad cases were out there so i headed to amazon and overstock. 
i did find a impressive assortment of other brands like otterbox, incase, mivizu, belkin, speck. 
i even found some real trendy brands like marc jacobs, michael kors, and donna karan and even issey miyake. 
while the assortment is deep and wide, i was still looking for a clean, sophisticated design with an elegant appeal to simplism. 
after review all the brands, i settled for mivizu. the have great customer reviews, the product has well design and meaningful layout that serves it's us and purpose. 
i found an ipad case that delivered on all my requirements, including delivering a great value against some of the other competing brands. 
i do like, but i instead choose something a little more minimalist with clean contours and outlines. 
here is what i have ordered in the meantime.
