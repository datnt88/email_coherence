i am trying to install a sata connected dvd writer. 
i have hooked up the sata connection and see there is another cable to attach to the back of the dvd_rw it is the same connection going to my hard drive, i assume it the power cable. 
my problem is this, it is too short. 
can i get an extension and what is that type of cable called.
