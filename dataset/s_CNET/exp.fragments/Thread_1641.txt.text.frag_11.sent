winsockfix fixed it for me too. 
i spent hours on netgear tech support line with some helpful reps, but after hitting the end of the road they suggested i contact hp about the network adapter. 
i decided it would be easier to buy a new one which didn't work either. 
this fix gave me an immediate connection. 
thanks!
