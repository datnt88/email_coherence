i've enjoyed a wireless network for some time. 
after hurricane charlie, things got messed up and i'm in the process of networking a different computer to my host (winxp). the guest computer operating system is win mn. i access the internet through cable modem and use a linksys wireless router. 
i've played with this for days. 
i've unplugged everything, redone it and checked all of the addresses etc., over and over. 
i used to get 100% signal between the pcs and now the best i can get is 67%. the guest computer won't even log on to the internet. 
i'm sure i'm overlooking some simple thing but my mind is now fried! 
can you suggest what i might have missed? 
thank you.
