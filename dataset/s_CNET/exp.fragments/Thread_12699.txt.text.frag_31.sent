yes, it's been quite a journey but i'm far more aware of how it all works now - took my imac a little for granted (it had worked so well) until this happened. 
i may try the firewire to see what happens... thanks for the various bits of advice and best wishes for 2007 to all of you - good to know there are people who share their knowledge/expertise so readily. 
hopefully i can offer some help of my own to someone at some point.
