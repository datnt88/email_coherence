so how slow is usb 2.0 compared to ide? 
(keep in mind i'll be using it with a 4+ year old computer.) also, what about firewire, or external sata interfaces / drives? 
i do need to be able to stream high-definition uncompressed audio and video, often multiple streams, for editing and viewing on my local machine, allowing for any bottleneck ram / cpu / etc might present. 
and, for a 500gb (or 400gb) drive, is there a level below which i should avoid (meaning drives more prone to failure, for example, not necessarily having fewer features), even if i have to up my budget to, say, $135-150 or so?
