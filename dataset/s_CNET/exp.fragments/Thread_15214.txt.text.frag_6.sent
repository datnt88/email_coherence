go to show all my connections. 
look to see if the connection that you are using to connect to the internet is bridged. 
normally it will say the name of the connection, the next line will tell you if is connected or not, followed for the word &quot;bridged&quot; or &quot;firewalled.&quot; if you see the word &quot;bridge&quot;, right click and look for &quot;unbridge connection.&quot; 
click on it and the connection should unbridged by itself. 
good luck!
