this usually doesnt happen with computers but i am stumped. 
last night my pc died on me, no lock up or warning, just turned off. 
when i went to turn it back on, and in every attempt there after, i get power for all of 1 second. 
the fans fire up, disk drives light, and thats it. 
i replaced the power supply not too long ago but it has been working fine for about 3 months. 
the mother board is getting power, when switched &quot;off.&quot; 
so im guessing it is not that. 
any help would be appreciated. 
xp p4 200mhz 512 self built power supply is 550w did not smell any burn up.
