if you are looking for better disk performance, pay attention to the spindle speed as much as anything else. 
disks that turn 10,000 rpm are faster (about 2x) than 7,200 rpm drives. 
yes, they do cost more but if you want a faster disk drive, the metric to pay attention to is not size. 
it is spindle speed. 
raid 1 across 4 drives is the fastest typical pc disk configuration. 
it is substantially faster than a single disk and noticeably faster than a pair.
