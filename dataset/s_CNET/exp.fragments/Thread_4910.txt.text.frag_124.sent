i went for about 6 months with no problems until my vista op system got that &quot;must exit-- rebooting-- must exit-- reboot&quot; endless loop in windows explorer... there was nothing i could do to fix it, so i set up a new copy of vista. 
it acted like a whole different computer. 
and the 55 minute crash was there. 
i took out video card, went into the bios setup to fix the fan cooling, installed bios and mboard updates, and i still had the problems. 
i finally installed xp3, through a process of creating an xp3 install disc that included all of the drivers for various parts of this computer that didn't exist when xp was the main opsys. 
(otherwise you get the bsod. 
there are instructions for this throughout this thread --much earlier). 
since that time, 18 hours ago, the 5478 has been continuously on in an unairconditioned room without a crash. 
(don't worry, i'll put the air on soon.) and the hard drive is as quiet as could be-- compared to that constant crunching that was happening when vista was &quot;in charge.&quot; 
i have no idea which combination of these items did the trick, but i think it was getting a proper xp installed. 
the computer now seems so &quot;civilized&quot;.
