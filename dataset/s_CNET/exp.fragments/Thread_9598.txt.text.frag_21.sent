i see that you want to remove static. 
this is very easy. 
just ground yourself and hold onto the laptop at some metal surface. 
the usb port is a good one. 
in a minute the static is drained. 
now you say its still there? 
let's say it is. 
and let's say it causes your mouse to jump. 
here's the problem. 
as the mouse jumps some of that potential energy is used up so it will fade within a few minutes. 
-&gt; i feel your frustration with the jumping mouse but you are pursuing a dead end. 
maintain this direction at your own peril of missing out on the real fixes.
