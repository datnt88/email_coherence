what you also should be able to do is to select both your adsl usb modem and the local area connection in your network connections window and right click them and select bridge connections. 
if both computers have static ips assigned to their network cards, which i assume they do since they are talking to each other, this should also work. 
make sure that on the pc that is not connected to the asdl modem, you assign dns numbers and make the gateway the ip address of the computer that is connected to the internet.
