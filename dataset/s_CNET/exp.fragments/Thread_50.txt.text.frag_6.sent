i agree that core 2 duo is the better bfb (bang for buck) right now. the caviat comes in with my price limit. 
i am supposed to build the best computer possible being as close to $700 as possible. 
i can do it with a conroe e6300, but it is hard to find a good mobo that doesnt cost as much as the proc! 
we will see how it ends up.
