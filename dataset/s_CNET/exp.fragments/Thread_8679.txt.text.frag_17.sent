i-pad has too many shortcomings to become the standard. 
i think the term tablet fits, including the i-pad. 
it all comes down to features; the i-pad is more or less feature constrained. 
compared to some of the more popular andriod devices, it has a way to go. 
i'm quite sure apple thought about adding those features but gave in or up i don't know which.
