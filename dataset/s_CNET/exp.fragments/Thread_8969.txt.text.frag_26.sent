i have been running a home network since the days of windows 95, so there have been many times when i have reformatted and started over.over 
time it has become something i do less often. 
in the win95 days i got caught by a worm , that i just could not eradicate from my network. 
on a few occasions it was as a result of uninstalling a game and finding that the os was buggered. 
by win98 things got a bit better in those days it was often a case of starting over when i'd spent several hours on a problem and simply wanted to get things up and running again. 
i have always maintaied a comprehensive backup and separate drives for that so a rebuild would only take an hour or less. 
windows 2000 and xp are far better and although i have had one problem in recent years i could not solve my ability to fault find the os has also improved. 
so its something i do less often now. 
indeed i cannot recall doing this in xp at all.
