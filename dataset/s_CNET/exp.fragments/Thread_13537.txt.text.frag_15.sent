i've only quickly scanned these discussions but i can believe that i haven't yet seen any mention of apple's time capsule. 
it's a wireless nas solution that's platform neutral. 
and if you happen to have a mac with leopard, backups are automatic with time machine. 
my house has both macs and pcs so this was the only thing that i could find where we could access files- with any relative ease - from both platforms... love it. 
it's another great product from apple.
