i may not have had the original install osx disks, but those i had worked! 
all's fine on it now, except it's running 10.2.8, housecat?, 
instead of panther 10.3.9. eventually i'll buy the panther disks again, but for now it's fine. 
i can now see that the ram is 320mb; what would be the max ram, and would there be any real benefit to going there? 
thanks again very much for your help.
