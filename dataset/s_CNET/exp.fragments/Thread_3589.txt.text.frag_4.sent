having worked in the audio industry for decades, i can tell you from experience and scientific knowledge, never connect speakers to headphone jacks. the requirements for each are totally different. 
even if you do get sound out of the speaker(s), you are overloading the sound card's audio output amp/circuit, and it will eventually fail. 
use a large speaker and it will fry the card immediately. 
(you'll smell the smoke too!) remember this simple rule-of-thumb: jacks are labeled for their specific purpose. 
if the audio jack could be used for both headphones and speakers, it would be labeled as such.
