my macbook is connected to the internet via my airport extreme transceiver/router. 
suddenly it fails to connect to the internet although signal strength is high. 
when i abandon the extreme and opt for the plain old wifi offered on the primary household system, voila! 
internet. 
but the extreme is faster and preferred on this machine. 
i have recycled power on the extreme's hardware unit. 
no joy. 
i'm running os-x, 10.5.2. no software updates pending. 
thanks. 
regards, tom mcknight
