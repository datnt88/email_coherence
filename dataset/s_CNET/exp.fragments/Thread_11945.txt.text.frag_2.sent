here's the bridge i used. 
however it may tax the occasional networker or users. the wgps606 was so cheap and worked so well that at 25 i bought two. 
let me state that to setup as a bridge you cheat and lie that you are setting it up as a print server but bail out when you get to the print setup. 
viola, a bridge. 
try google for the refurbs or bob
