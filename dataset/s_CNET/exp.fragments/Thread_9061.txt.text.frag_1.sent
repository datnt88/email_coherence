if i want to see how much 'memory' my pc can handle, i can browse to crucial.com and run their scanner - this will tell me the maximum amount that my pc can hold and exactly what type to buy. 
how can i do the same to find a pata 'internal hard drive' for my pc? i am unemployed so i can't afford to waste money buying a hdd that my pc can't handle. 
for example:- xp can handle 2 terra-bits but my old dell dimension 3000 can only run a max hdd size of 160 gigs. 
i have older pcs and need to increase their hdd size - but can't get the info from the manufacturer on max hdd size. 
i am already running the most up-to-date bios upgrade that their web site holds. 
some bios's can only handle 40 gigs, others can handle 137 gigs - but how can i tell without 'trial and error'? 
this is not a storage issue, i already have an external usb drive for that. 
i just need the largest and fastest internal pata hdd that my old pc will run. 
is there a scanner out there that can do the job? 
many thanks - mike
