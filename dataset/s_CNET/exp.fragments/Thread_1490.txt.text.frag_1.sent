hi: i've got a friend who wants to set up a wireless network at home, the thing is he is already using a wired modem/router with 4 ports. 
so im wondering to set up a wireless network, is the best option just to buy a wireless modem/router and replace the wired one? 
or is it possible to get a wireless router only and use that with the wired modem/router? 
if it's possible, how would i go about doing that? 
cheers
