i had a similar problem. 
i replaced a 350 watt power supply with a 425 watt power supply before adding two new cd/dvd burners. 
total power supply wattage used was 375 watts. 
two months later, i added a pci card for firewire. 
the pc started to turn itself off after being used for a few seconds. 
changed the pci card, no joy still the unexpected turn off. 
i checked the power available and found i needed 105 watts of +5vdc power but the power supply only put out 100 watts of 5vdc! 
changed to a 500 watt power supply with 175 watts of +5vdc power and problem solved. 
moral of this story, not all powersupply wattages are created equal. 
just because the total wattage is great enough does not mean the +5, +12, or -12 vdc wattage is great enough.
