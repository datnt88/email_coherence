the only cd that came with my emachines t6212 is the windows xp. i had &quot;interactual player&quot; on here and that would not play either so i figured the drive was bad. 
i forgot i bought a geek squad contract so i called them. 
they had me uninstall the dvdrw drive in the device manager and restart my computer. 
winxp detected it and reinstalled the drivers and now it works. 
thank you for your input.
