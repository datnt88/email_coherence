each security software company should answer that question or you should remove them from your list. 
but i too am looking at pads for a new system. 
however we need bluetooth spp (you can google that) so we are looking at the new and arriving android pads. 
these are showing up at a much lower price. 
even the fully loaded 10 inch is 399 with the next wave looking to fall to 199 bucks. 
any reason to stick with the ipad?
