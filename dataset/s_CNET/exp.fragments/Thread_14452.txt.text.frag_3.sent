thanks for your speedy answer: (1) the hard drive was formated to ntfs - maybe that's why the data was recoverable at all! 
(2) i have been to the website of the mainboards manufacturer & downloaded all the drivers/updates for that board. 
unfortunately it still hasn't sorted the problem. 
so, if you (or anyone else) can think of anything else i'd be very gratefull! 
thanks, jeff
