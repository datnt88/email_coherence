i have disabled the firewall in the router and on windows and it changes nothing. 
i appreciate the input though it was definetely the first thing that everyone suggested everywhere in every post and thing i have found in every place i have looked to try and fix this though. 
i figure as much of what you say thats why i am completely bugged out about it since lg doesnt run the home network i figure they wont be able to help. 
i am having a really hard time accepting that its not a network or configuration issue. 
although since today the dlna input has stopped working completely i am trying to convince myself this is possible. 
after spending all this time with them today and having lg decide to schedule the local technician to come out i am hoping the guy who comes will know but they called and said they are going to replace the motherboard on the tv so they pushed back the time of coming until they get the part. 
it was working in the past day though this says too me it has to be a configuration issue, and it worked fine for years before i switched to verizon fios and it worked fine for 2 months until that day 24 days ago when it just randomly stopped. 
now that i have access to my router i have triied to really favor the device and open up anything i can on it. 
i figured out which one of them is the tv through the ip address and when looking in my router i can now see it and it does say its active: new-host: connection type: wireless access shared files website blocking block internet services port forwarding view device details rename this device ip address: 192.168.1.3 ip address allocation: dhcp mac address: e8:5b:5b:4c:d7:b8 ethernet: 1 device(s) coax: 4 device(s) wireless: 2 device(s) pc name: new-host connection type: wireless ip address: 192.168.1.3 status: active and as i am typing this the tv is connected to the internet through the proper access point the ip address is 1.1 of my pc though and the tv is 1.3 and i am also certain that my media server(s) are up and running i have 4 oft them up and running and they were all viewable this morning when everything was working until i came back from running errands and they just disappeared again. 
remember though this time (today) the dlna input is completely greyed out and instead of showing itself lit up and allowing me to click it and access just the verizon fios stb and the rest of the list where my pc name and the media server name would populate since today only the dlna input is gone entirely and doesnt even have the option to go to it for the verizon fios stb (set top box)
