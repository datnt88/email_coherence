you say you need to post the same in 3 different forums. 
sorry but that isn't how these forums work. 
posting once will get any help that is available from those who help out in all of these forums. 
but posting more than once with the same problem will confuse the issue as different helpers offer different advice not knowing you have posted elsewhere, and may miss further important information you provide in one discussion but not the others. 
it doesn't triple the chances, it just causes confusion and time wasting. 
sorry but posting again elsewhere in these forums and forum policy kicks in.
