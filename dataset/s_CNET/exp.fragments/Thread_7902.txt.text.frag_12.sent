ok heres an update. 
i called dell to find out how to change the setting and it turns out that that was not the issue. the ram i ordered is too fast for the system, it is 1066 and can only handle ecc at 667 or 800, non-ecc at 667. 
so i will return the ram to crucial and exchange for the proper speed of the same ram. 
once i get that back i will install it and update you all. 
i greatly appreciate your help with this, thank you again. 
shadoe
