no! you will need to have your internal cdrom fixed or get a firewire/usb cdrom that is bootable. 
you need to boot from the cd to install os x. os x has thousands of invisible files that do not move when you copy the drive. 
there are programs that will do it though, carbon copy cloner being one, but you will still have to boot from something other than the drive being cloned.
