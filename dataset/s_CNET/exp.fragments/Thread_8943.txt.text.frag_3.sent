everything i have read on forums, says it will recognize ntsc standard format, most computers use. 
this does not mean it will, but is the assumption going in. 
if i could get this erased drive back to useable, and at least be able to see the drive on my good working computer; then i could assume it is a problem with the dvr recognition. 
you are probably right with many dvr's, but this one is a bit more open format.... i think. 
i realize i am not going to be able to read stuff off the dvr back to the computer, and don't intend to do any of that. 
i just want to be able to run the dvr with a bit more capacity, same as it ran before. 
other's claim to just stick a wd drive up to 320gig in, and off it goes. 
i have yet to get a clean formatted drive to offer the dvr. 
i nuked the older computer drive with dban. 
now i need to get the computer to recognize it, before i even try the dvr again. 
someone mentioned cloning; but i am not sure if i am at that step yet. cloning will not do the firmware and format i don't think??? if i get the drive recognized on the computer, and it still won't take on the dvr; i think then i may try a clone. 
the dvr has a format option in its menus; but i have not gotten the menu to come up with the erased drive here.i have not tried putting both drives on a single harness cable(into the dvr) and trying that way. 
that might be my next step. 
i just need to get this drive back to the way it might come from a store. 
firmware, and formated. 
thank you moderator! 
i am open for suggestions here.
