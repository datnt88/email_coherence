mostly people who are hardcore gamers and have around 1-2 machines. 
the tech support person probably did improvise though... eventurally firmware updates will fix the problem. 
and don't try flashing over a wireless connection, only wired, or you'll brick your router. 
i emphasize eventually. 
one possibilty is that it cannot handle many global connections, as in total connections from the the outside world to your network. 
my di-624 had a cap of 200; past that it would disconnect, so maybe someone is runing a p2p program like limewire, ares, bittorrent, or azureus. 
this affects (somewhat) many routers, across brands. 
also, it may have a problem with its upnp, like other d-link routers (like mine). 
i go around that by using portforward.com and manually fixing the firewall. 
some links that could help: (in case your upnp is faulty and you have to manually port forward) keyword:router--&gt;bittorrent client--routers known to have problems with bittorrent clients sorry the link to the place is huge and would take up the whole page. 
should help a little bit. 
gets updated.
