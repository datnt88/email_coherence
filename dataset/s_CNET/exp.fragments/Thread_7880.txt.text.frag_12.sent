this is for college -- since he's obviously not going into college until the fall, he doesn't have to buy right away. 
and it's not really speculation that i'm making: it's a known fact that intel's santa rosa platform for notebooks (which involves a new mainboard chipset as well as a new cpu) is due by april/may, and will eliminate that one memory barrier. 
it should also boost integrated graphics on those systems that don't use dedicated chips. 
when it comes to the existing macbook's limits, i'm not so sure apple's words are anything more than a discussion of factory options. 
the chipset in the macbook is the same as for the macbook pro. 
unless there's less physical space and the 2gb sticks are bigger, it may just be a way of upselling people to the macbook pro.
