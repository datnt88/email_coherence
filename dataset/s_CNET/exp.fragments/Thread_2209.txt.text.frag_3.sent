hello bob, thanx for your humorous but nonetheless serious reply. 
i found a site that helps which i share with you (and all who migh come across this issue): now, i have another question: bearing in mind that i am nill in physics, let's say my pc power consumption is 300 watts and it runs for 12 hours daily; what formula do i use to get the 12hrs power consumption? 
thank you
