i recently bought a 20&quot; flat panel and i want to improve my video performance. 
these are the specs on my pc: pentium iii 800 mhz 512 mb sdram 100 mhz nvidia geforce ddr 64 mb agp 1x/2x/4x would i see any noticeable improvement if i just added a mid-level video card like the ati radeon 9600 128 mb w/ dvi out or would the cpu/ram require upgrading as well? 
thanks is advance, p|&lt;
