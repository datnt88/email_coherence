i have opened the box and from my limited experience and research, i think that it's a pata. 
i see the 40 pin connector etc... now that i have voided my warranty (yay!) what should i do next? 
i would like to get my data of off it, i'm pretty sure that the drive is functioning and that it was a case/power issue. 
i appreciate your help in advance.
