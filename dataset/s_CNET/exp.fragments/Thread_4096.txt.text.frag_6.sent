don't get hung-up on the 1000 vs 1024 memory status. 
in the computer world 1024=1meg(mb), thus 2meg=2048 what your system supports. 
two things come to mind on your problem. 
though you have alike ram modules they have a timing issue, its that close. 
next, you a slightly off ram module or starting to fail and its a weak link. 
last, because this is a asrock mtrbd., i consider their products bottom-end offering. 
that means, they could have less than perfect or borderline quality, in other words, cheap. 
if a bios update is lacking, then do it or at least see what the bios update does, it may correct the problem. 
i would think if you have access to yet another &quot;matched pair&quot; of ram modules you could test the install and clear alot of questions. 
under the ram voltage setting, see if a slight tweek helps. 
check the ram setup and see how its addressed. 
maybe be more conversation or up it, play with it instead of &quot;auto&quot; setting.
