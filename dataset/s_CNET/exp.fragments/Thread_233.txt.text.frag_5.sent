second screen? 
re dimms? 
also the sites i was able to access has let me know that i have to have a 64bit cpu...but i am not familiar with windows xp..and xp64 so i am not going to download that just yet...but it states that a 32bit os can only handle roughly 2gbs of ram..and 64bit can handle 4...i will have to do more research with google and i will update this after my results...thanks to both of you for your help.
