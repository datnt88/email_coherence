that's not compatible with xp and it's a known bug. 
microsoft will not be issuing a fix. 
while word 97 does run, it has this and at least two other bugs. 
again, no patch will be arriving for these issues. 
ever. 
forget about it. 
what to do? 
- endtask word when it hangs like that. 
- try the usual word cureall. 
delete all normal.dot 
files. 
- go get open office from and use it instead. 
sorry about that, but i have to be direct and brutal about this issue since i found if just be subtle, people miss the message.
