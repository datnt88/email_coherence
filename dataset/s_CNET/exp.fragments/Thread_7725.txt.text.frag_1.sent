i'm set to purchase a replacement pc for my office and have been looking at the hewlett packard's and sony avaio's i don't need a computer high in graphic or media capabilities but rather, one that will handle wordprocessing, databases, some desktop publishing but most importantly, accounting software. 
i would also want good display quality as the majority of my day is spent within the accounting program and a good display is very important. 
i have heard that xp professional might be the preferred os for running standard business software can anyone give me some hints on what is the best choice?
