i just read a report on repair rates, and the asus looks really good in that regard. 
re: best buy and service on a netbook it's not like you need much done with it, save on shipping and easy return if yours falls in the small percent that is defective. 
compared to dell.com or similar outlets, i like best buy better than zero service from a call-center in india.
