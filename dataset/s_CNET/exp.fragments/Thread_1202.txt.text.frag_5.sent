is that i've written apps that log events and more to the sql database and with rare exception you can't use what is known as a headless server for some systems because they used windows. 
i don't want to duplicate all that has been written about headless servers but your product's maker must tell you if it can be done. 
keep in mine that i've done such but the costs are higher than if i went with a plain old pc with a card.
