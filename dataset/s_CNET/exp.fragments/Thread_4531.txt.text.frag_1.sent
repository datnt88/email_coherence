i have a maxtor 200g 7200 hard drive for an hp desktop. 
whenever the thinking light is on i hear a very loud grinding noise, its similiar to the sound all hard drives make just significantly louder, i've checked to make sure its installed properly and it is. 
my computer also seems to be a bit sluggish, which could be an entirely different problem, but might be related. 
i've run a pc doctor disk scan that came with the computer, and it said its ok...during the funnel search task it was about as loud as it gets, but during the other tasks it was generally quiet. 
any ideas on how to fix this issue, just wondering...thanks.
