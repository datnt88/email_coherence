more details please. 
does it do the same if you plug it into another system? 
have you tried removing power and data cables to the drive and letting it sit (drain flea power and cool off) for at least 30 min? 
if the enclosure has any status lights, do any of them blink when you try opening e:? have you tried another usb cable? 
do other usb storage devices work fine (usb keys and such)?
