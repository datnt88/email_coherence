well i tried this 2 more times and each time it came up complete, but on the cdrw the witing light never comes. 
i called radio shack today since thats where i bought it from and they ran me through a few things and they determined there was something wrong with the unit itself since the write lite dosent come on. 
they suggest that i just buy a new one since this one is outdated it was a 6x4x6 and it probably be cheaper just to replace. 
this really sucks since i've had it a year and a half and it had never even used since i bought it. 
until this past week. 
thanks for all your help nancy
