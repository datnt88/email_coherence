sorry for the confusion...i use ext as a short for external. 
anyway... none of my current computers have a multi pin port. 
except for my monitor which is db9. 
all of my ports are for usb, including my printers. 
i need an adaptor that will convert the multi pin on the ext zip plug to a usb plug for my cpu.
