but once again, both machines are running xp. both have the same user account with admin privileges. the drives i am trying to map to are fully shared with all read, write and change permissions granted to various users. 
i am now using a netgear vpn router/firewall running dhcp. 
both ethernet cards in the respective machines are configured to acquire an ip address from the dhcp server (netgear router). 
once again, i can ping each machine successfully from the other. 
and when i open a run dialogue box from the start menu and type in the ip address of the other machine, i get an explorer window showing all the shared files and folders on the other machine, which i can manipulate at will. 
however, whenever i try to map a drive i still get the error message that the network resource cannot be found and i may not have access permissions to connect to that resource. 
hmmmmmm.... most peculiar. 
some problem with netbios name resolution???
