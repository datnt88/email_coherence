thanks for responding to my post. 
perhaps i did not make myself clear. 
i replaced the original hard drive with an identical one [same manufacturer, same size, same model] and i installed the same o/s. 
everything worked. 
when i removed the new drive and replaced the old drive, the problem shows up. 
there is nothing wrong with the motherboard, usb ports, mouse or keyboard. the problem exists within the o/s for the original hard drive. 
i do not want to reinstall the o/s to the original drive because i will then loose critical files. 
i need to be able to find the problem with the original drive's o/s and repair withiut having to reformat it.
