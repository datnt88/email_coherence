i recently picked up an imation flash drive. 
it's advertised as 8gb, but windows only shows 7.52gb of available space. 
so i called imation and asked them what was up with that. 
they indicated that was normal, so i asked them why they advertised it as an 8gb drive if it really wasn't. the tech assured me it was an 8gb drive, so i asked him, if i tried to transfer 8gb of data to the drive, would it hold it? 
he said, &quot;no.&quot; sound like false advertising to you? 
sure does to me. is this standard for all flash drives, and if so, why?
