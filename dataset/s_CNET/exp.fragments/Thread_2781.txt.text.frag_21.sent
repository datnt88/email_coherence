i have built many computers and consistantly find that if i need all the parts (and software) it is a lot cheaper to buy a fully assembled computer. 
if you want to reuse the parts you listed you can build your own computer and save some money although a bare bones computer with memory, mb and cpu will probably be cheaper then buying the parts seperately. 
you can easily check this out on line with some of the larger online retailers.
