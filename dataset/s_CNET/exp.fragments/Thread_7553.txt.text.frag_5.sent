i had planned on using raid 5 for data security. 
we are talking about terabytes of data that i don't want to have to reload from the originals. 
if i use a string of independent drives i need to have some way to backup several 400-500gb drives. 
is there a cheaper more reliable solution for this than using a big raid?
