i contacted samsung which was a very pleasent experiance. 
they have you go through some checks (video card, dvi cable, etc) before they process your order. 
they will either ship you a new monitor w/ stand straight to your house (placing a deposit on your credit card) or you can have them send it to an ups store for replacement, which i did. the new monitor came within 5 days and has been working very well since arriving. 
hope all goes well for you but make sure you give them a call.
