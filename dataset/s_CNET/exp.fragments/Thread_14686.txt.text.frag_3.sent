re-attach the old monitor and do a de-install of its drivers plus whatever the mx420 entailed. 
once done it should revert to default native drivers, if not just do a shutdown especially if it comes back requiring some attention about video, do a shutdown. 
re-attach new monitor to system. 
next, upon boot-up do whatever it prompts you. 
it should ask for video card drivers and monitor. 
as kees offered, that usually means some .inf 
file(monitor) or what the install refers to. 
if none of this seems to helps it maybe because your mx420 video card is too old. 
its drivers are meant for older type monitors and may not be capable to match whatever the new monitor now offers so it may default to less than capable just to have video display. 
if that's the case, then a newer video card is required for best install and of course less hassles. 
i exclude the monitor itself as maybe working as best it can under the circumstances. 
come back with results.
