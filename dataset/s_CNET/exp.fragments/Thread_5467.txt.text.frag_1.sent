i am looking to log on to the internet if i am traveling and not at a wi-fi hotspot. 
i guess i am confused on the difference between wi-fi and wireless internet provided by a phone company like alltel or verizon. 
if i buy a laptop that says it has 802.11g, is that just good for wi-fi at a starbucks or some other &quot;hotspot&quot;, or will 802.11g also work for providing wireless internet access with a phone provider like alltel, verizon, etc? maybe i should also ask if 802.11g is a card built into a laptop, and if you must have another type of card for wireless internet service?
