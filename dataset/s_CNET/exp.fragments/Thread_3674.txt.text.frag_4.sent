if im not mistaking, i belive its tigerdirect, or something like that compared the 9800 gt and a saphire radeon hd 4830 and the 4830 got higher fps on some games, by i think around 5 frames? 
you could check the video out by going here (last time i checked, the 4830 was cheaper by about 10-30 dollars?) the video card is for sale here: it needs at least a 450 watt power supply i'm thinking about buying it, and a new power supply with it (550watt)
