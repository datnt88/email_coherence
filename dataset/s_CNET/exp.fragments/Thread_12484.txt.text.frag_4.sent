i agree with michael, security will be your issue. 
first disable all security and enable ssid broadcast. 
then set up your computers and make sure that they can connect to the network and internet. 
if they do then i would use mac filtering only. 
there is an issue with microsoft zero configuration, every so often it searches for a beter connection (no idea why) and if it cannot find one it logs back on to your network. 
with security enableed it cannot connect for some reason. 
with mac filtering you do not have this problem. 
if you are still having problems then try a different channel number, making sure each wireless computer is changed as well. 
if that doesn't work post back.
