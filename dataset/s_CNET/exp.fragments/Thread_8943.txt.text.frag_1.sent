now that i seem to have wiped my (ide)hard drive with dban...i need to get my dvr, to recognize it. 
first i need to get a look at it, and try formatting it to ntfs. 
so far, its no go, trying straight from dban erase, then into the dvr. 
i have 2 computers at my disposal. 
one is the old computer, the erased drive came from(also ide plarform) that now has no hard drive or os. the other, is a newer working computer(sata platform). 
i am now trying to read the ide(erased drive) with my sata computer that is fully functional. 
i got a cable that plugs into the usb drive of the sata computer, and then has a plug to fit the ide connection on the erased drive. 
i then powered the tethered drive, from the old computer power supply beside it. 
ugly, but best i can do under the circumstance. 
the drive on the end of the cable runs, and shows up on the sata computer, under device manager. 
it does not show up under &quot;computer&quot; or in windows explorer menu. 
i ran hp diagnostics(pc doctor) and notification came up that sata disc management or something; could not recognize the drive firmware. 
it allowed me to run a test from the notification window on the erased drive; and it failed pretty quick. 
perhaps dban erased the firmware, and i need to re-instal the firmware? 
when i looked under the drive properties in device manager; there was no firmware showing in the box next to firmware. 
this is why i am thinking firmware. 
i have the discs for the drive i am working with; but nothing seems to want to install anywhere. 
neither the working computer, or the tethered drive. 
i went to western digital sight, searched the drive model number; and can't seem to find anything that looks like a firmware update, or firmware. 
i might just be too dumb to figure out the sight. 
maybe i am completely off track here. 
any ideas how to get this erased drive recognized, so i may attempt to format it, and or, scan it. 
i suspect if i can get it recognized by my working computer and format it ftsc; i can get the dvr to recognize it. 
please help. 
any ideas here. 
anyone who has used a tether across platforms like this. 
i don't have another ide computer with drive and operating system; or i would put the erased drive on there. 
i am stuck with the old computer drive(ide) and new computer(sata). 
i don't have another ide drive to put the os on, and run the old computer. 
or i would not be working across platforms. 
the one other long shot, is trying to put the old dvr hard rive that still seems to work, in with the erased drive i am trying to format; and see if the dvr might erase and format them both. 
this probably won't work if firmware is missing either. 
does dban wipe the firmware?
