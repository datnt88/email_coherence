i live in a 3 story townhouse and my pc is set up on the first floor. 
my cable company provides my internet and phone services. 
i am on bedrest and am restricted to the 3rd floor so i have purchased a laptop. 
i want to be able to use it from the 3rd floor so i need to set up some type of network. 
i called the cable company and was told all i need to do is get a splitter and wireless router and hook it up to my cable connection on the third floor. 
i believe it entails more than that and wanted to check. 
i thought the router needed to be connected to my cable modem but that wouldn't work for me since it is on the 1st floor. 
any advice would be helpful.
