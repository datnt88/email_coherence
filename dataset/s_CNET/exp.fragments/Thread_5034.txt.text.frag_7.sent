connected the data and power cables ...and go ! the question is what can you cable the old hdd to in the new system ? 
is the hard drive in the new system connected to the hard drive by a long skinny cable (sata) or is it connected to the hard drive by a wide flat cable (pata)? 
perhaps it would help if you identified new system's hdd...make and model number.
