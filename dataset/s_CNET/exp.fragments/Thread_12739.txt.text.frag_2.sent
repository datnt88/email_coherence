a fuser problem is serious but since this is a new printer, use the warranty now. 
don't play with it as more than likely you can't recover and you *may void* the warranty in any attempts, so use the warranty. 
you should have returned it immediately once the problem cropped-up to be within the quicker satifaction settlement period, you may now have to deal with a warranty center if not the vendor themselves for repair, but start the process. 
plus, document this as well, cal,s letters, etc. to best serve yourself if any other problems arise.
