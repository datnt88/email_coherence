my wife's laptop is not in a domain. 
it shares the same workgroup name as the other pcs. 
curiously i am currently setting up another lenovo laptop to replace her aging one and i am encountering the same issue with this one. 
attempted access from my desktop (wired or wireless) is greeted with a logon window. 
attempted access from the laptop to my desktop gets the (station name) not accessible message. 
&quot;you might not have permission...etc.&quot; i will figure this out. 
thanks for the reply.
