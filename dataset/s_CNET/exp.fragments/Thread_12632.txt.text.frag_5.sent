provantage has a lot of stuff that newegg doesn't zipzoom, as mentioned here, is very limited but often has the best price. 
i've dealt with them. 
what i do like about newegg is their pictures of the products. 
they are by far the best at giving you an idea of what you're getting...inside and outside of the box. 
provantage does have a lot of the better brands....particularly with networking goods. 
i live in they state they are addressed in so they do charge me tax. 
their shipping is cheaper than newegg and often the pricing too so the total costs are close. 
i've had excellent service from both newegg and provantage.
