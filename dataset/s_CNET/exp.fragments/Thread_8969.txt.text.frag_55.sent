when i first got a pc back in 1994 or thereabouts i was advised by a computer savvy friend &quot;do not turn your pc off - ever&quot; reason being is that the state of all the components changes, and this wears them out. 
far better to leave them all on all the time - no changes of state, no changes of temperature, etc. if this is true, it sheds some light on the recent calls to &quot;switch off your computer when not in use&quot; to help combat global warming. 
because if it is true, it means that you damage your pc and will need a new one sooner, which is precisely what &quot;they&quot; want. 
you will save less energy by turning off regularly and then having to buy a new one with all its embodied energy, than by leaving on permanently. 
i would welcome comments on this. 
i have also recently read that if you leave your pc on, the hard disk keeps turning, and that this tires out the motor bearings, bringing about earlier failure - and the need for a new pc! but surely you can keep your pc on without the hard disk turning all the time? 
comments please!
