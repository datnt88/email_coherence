gee, everyone has made good suggestions and for children that age it would be best to go for an inexpensive used or low priced as others have suggested. 
the webcam/video camera that cv4stm suggest is inexpensive and should be a hit with them. 
he should know as he has stated before that he is 15 years old. 
when my grandchildren come over they play with my 500mhz desktop that i paid $2375 for 6 yrs ago now worth about $200, or the emachine 766mhz. 
if they need to play a current high tech game then they use my 2.0 ghz desktop.
