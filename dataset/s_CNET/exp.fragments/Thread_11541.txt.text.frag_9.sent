thanx again. 
i actually did have belarc advisor but that doesn't help now because i can't even get windows to open to access it. 
i actually think my hard drive is the problem and i committed the ultimate sin-that's right-i didn't back up. 
live and learn. 
hope that's not it. 
any other ideas will be appreciated. 
thanx.
