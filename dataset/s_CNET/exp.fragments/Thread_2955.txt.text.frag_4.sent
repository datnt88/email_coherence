if the connector goes to a standard keyboard lock on the front panel of the pc, removing the connector from the mb only disables your ability to lock the keyboard. 
a jumper would just lock it again so leave it disconnected. 
if the ram has been removed and not properly reinstalled, you will get beeps, especially if in slot &quot;0&quot;. 
i recall something about the first 64k as being mandatory. 
there is no beep code standard for mb manufacturers so, if you can, i would check for a support site for yours. 
most likely the bios chips are from ami or pheonix.
