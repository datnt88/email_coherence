i know that bad caps can cause all sorts of strange behavior. 
i also gave the caps a good inspection yesterday and none had bulging tops or were spewing electrolyte. 
i guess they don't always show their failure externally. 
this would explain potential voltage regulation problems through. 
i checked in bios and the cpu voltage is higher than spec. 
thanks, conor
