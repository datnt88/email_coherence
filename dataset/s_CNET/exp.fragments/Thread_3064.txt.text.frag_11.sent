hi i am kind of in the same boat ... i'm still using an athlon xp 1800+ with a via kt 266/333 chipset and that mobo does use agp. 
so, got a cheap evga fx5500 256mb card from newegg. 
having problems, think it's the motherboard and/or the chipset. 
so, i'm going to probably be buying a cheap &quot;for now&quot; (like emachine t6528) computer so we have something to use until i can get my custom built re-built. 
then figure out how to network the 2 computers. 
i looked at the motherboard you chose, looked around and found this one: about the same price. 
if you already have an agp card and need to upgrade this may work for you. 
personally, i'm reading everything review-wise i can on all the boards i'm looking at. 
this site and google can be your friends. the motherboard, processor and power supply from my (limited) understanding are the 3 most important components in your computer. 
you don't have to pay top dollar for the latest or just for a name, but i believe it does pay to spend that little extra to get good quality. 
just my .02
