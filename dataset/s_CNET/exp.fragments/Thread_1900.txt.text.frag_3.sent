if the poster wants a dual boot situation for w98 on original drive and xp on the new, it's not gonna happen....he may or may not be able to edit the boot.ini 
file to do it, but it won't be automatic. 
but he will end up with access to that original boot drive the way you mentioned and maybe that's all he wants while he moves/copies files over to the new and then format the old again to empty it out.
