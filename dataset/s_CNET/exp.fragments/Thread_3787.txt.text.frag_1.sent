hey guys, i wasn't exactly sure where to put this. 
so i thought the general section would be a good bet. 
anyways, here is my dilemma. 
currently i'm looking to upgrade the ram on my pc. i have an acer aspire m1100 desktop and my processor is a amd athlon 64 processor 4000+ 2.60 ghz the main issue(i believe?) is that my ram is horrific. 
i only have 1 gb. 
so essentially, any pc game made after 2008 doesn't run, at all. 
even league of legends, which i feel isn't too bad resource wise. 
i have to play on &quot;very low&quot; graphics, no shadows and sound off to even get to 35 fps, and i even have to kill processes to do so. 
this isn't counting games like dota2 which don't even load, or minecraft which lags unless i turn everything down. 
so my question is this, how big of an improvement would i see if i upgraded to say, 2 gb of ram? or say i decided to jump up to 4gb or 8gb of ram. 
my pc would not explode, correct? 
or at the very least, would it even be compatible to run 4 or 8 gb of ram? and would the performance be stellar? 
thank you so much for your time, and reading through all that stuff!
