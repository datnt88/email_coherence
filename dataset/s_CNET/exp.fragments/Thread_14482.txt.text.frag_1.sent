i ran a new cable out of my current router and house, around the backside and around fromt up to the 2nd floor. 
crimped and put on the rj45 cable ends, hooke dit up and got the lights blinking and thought all was well. 
but not, so since putting those rj45 on the ends is not easy, what is the way to tell which end is bad or if both ends i put on incorrectly. 
i do have the colors correctly but really can't tell if they are all the way into the plug. 
looks right but it does not work. 
help please!!
