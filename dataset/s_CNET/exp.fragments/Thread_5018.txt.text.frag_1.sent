hi everyone, i would appreciate any help. 
here is my problem. 
i have 2 windows accounts. 
let's name them account a and account b. when i log on to account a the cd and dvd drives work perfectly and when i switch to account b, they don't. 
i get the following message &quot; drive:is not accessible. 
access is denied&quot;. 
if i log on account b they work and then switch to account a, they don't. 
that means they work only with the first account. 
they use to work on both accounts. 
i would grately appreciate any help. 
thanks a lot
