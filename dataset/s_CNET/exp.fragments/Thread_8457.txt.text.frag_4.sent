if you've not done so already. 
as well, i wonder if your pc has on board graphics that have taken over the show. 
if you have another video card connection, try that one. 
does the card have an external power source that might not be plugged in or seated properly? 
can you try another monitor as well? 
other than those thoughts, i've no idea unless the card was damaged. 
but a missing video card uses causes beeps during post.
