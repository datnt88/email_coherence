multiple speed fans are doing their job when they encounter increase temps. 
once cooled enough they will throttle down or up if the temp increases. 
if the bios cpu temp is too conservative you may increase it(only abit). 
you can also, select to &quot;shutdown&quot; rather than reboot if that's the cause. 
many a system will upon initial boot=up kick-in high then settle as the system handles the temp from whatever means. 
dust alone defeat heatsinks and/or fan(s) as they collect on fins, etc.. it does happen that a design flaw can exist, but it maybe more of pushing the envelope for certain cpus or poor wire harness routing and/or airflow in a case.
