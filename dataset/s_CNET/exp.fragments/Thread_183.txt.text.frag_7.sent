i tried to verify specs at gateway and no such model# is shown. 
so, what does the oem decal/sticker offer? 
is this really a dx-430 series or dx-4300 series? 
it makes a difference in order to see what gateway case was provided. 
on top of all the posts you already have. 
i did a google search and found *only* your dx-4305c posts and generic gateway dx series offerings. 
just so you know... -----willy
