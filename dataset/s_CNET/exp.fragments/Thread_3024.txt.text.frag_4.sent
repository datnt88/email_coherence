a router can very easily become a dlna server if it has a usb port for external drives. 
usb3 works well with 802.11n wifi - you wont get much better unless you use a wired gigabit setup...but do you really want the clutter? 
i use the netgear n600 adsl2+ router/modem, with my bravia and boxee (on older tv) - i have no complaints. 
why dont i use a nas - getting a decent nas is too costly to be feasible.
