i just went to load up a cd when my cd/dvd player didnt reconize it. 
i then tried a few other disk still nothing. 
im wondering if it has somthing to do with me recently formatting my computer. 
i checked the dirvers and they seem to be fine. 
anyone have a clu what the problem is? 
if so reply and ill aprreciate it. 
thanks all
