hi, everyone. 
so, i'll try this with a little bit more to get more response. 
what if i upgraded to say a 550 or larger psu? i know that my computer is old and only running a pentium d. would it make sense to be able to go to a modern graphics card? 
or is this just a waste of money in your opinion. 
i like what bob had to say about the gt240 but i'm still a little concerned about power.
