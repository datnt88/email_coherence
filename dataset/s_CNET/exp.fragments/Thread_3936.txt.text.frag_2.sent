in short, no. the cpu on most is soldered on the mainboard as well as the video section. 
laptops are usually relegated to memory and hard disk upgrades. 
i got lucky and fitted my 4x cdrw with a new dvd/cdrw 24x drive. the hard disk was some 11gb slug and now its a 40gb 5400 rpm drive. 
windows 2000 boots in 1/2 the time so i think it was worth the effort.
