n/n g/g if you go to g from n it will then default to g, defeating the purpose of the n, would it work, well yes, in g mode. 
if you are running a gigabit system (hardwire) 10/100/100 as opposed to 10/100, that is where the cat 6 instead of cat 5 comes in, faster transfer rate, that is also where (hardwired) the gigabit (10/100/1000) hardware comes in, nic cards for desktops more specifically. 
and again, depending on upload/download rates from server. 
wireless is another story dual band n gigabit router and n antennae for wireless units, it can go on and on. 
gaming and streaming wirelessly can be a bit iffy, lots of variables, hardwire is generally a bit more reliable.
