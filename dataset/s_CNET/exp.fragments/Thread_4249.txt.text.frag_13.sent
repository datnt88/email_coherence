my problem probably is different: my new r3240us can see the ssid from my neighbor's linksys router, but not the one from my own netgear wgt634u, which i know is working with another notebook with a netgear wireless card. 
hp did answer within an hour, but only to suggest i check the router to be sure it is compatible with the broadcom b/g card in the notebook, which of course it is. 
i thought if your fix was easy, i'd try it.
