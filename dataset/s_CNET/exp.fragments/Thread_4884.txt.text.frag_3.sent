its on a parallel port (tried lpt1 & lpt2) and except that some of the older ones were not bidirectional am not aware of any settings it can do. 
of course it could be flakeyness in the mb/bios as i have found other glitches in this mb (ecs 848p-a) and i am considering scrapping it and putting in a better one. 
i selected it because it was on sale together with the p-4. 
what would i look for in the bios?
