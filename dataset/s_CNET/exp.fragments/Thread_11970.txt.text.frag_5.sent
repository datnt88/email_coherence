turned off all firewalls (realized my son's computer, pc#2)had norton internet security firewall on - thought he only had windows firewall and norton antivirus. 
anyway, turned all off, and voila - we could both see & access each other's computers. 
i then configured my ezarmor firewall to allow my network as a trusted zone for sharing info and configured his norton firewall to allow the network as well. 
turned them on and still had access both ways. 
i even printed through his printer. 
but... i put my pc (#1) on standby and went out - in the meantime, he shut his down to rearrange his computer desk. 
when i came off standby and he turned his on - back to the same problem as before for me - his pc shows in my workgroup view but tells me i don't have access when i try to view shared folders/printers, etc. he can still use my shared folders in his network places but goes back to previous error saying he does not have permission to access the workgroup when he tries to view the computers through there. 
i turned all firewalls back off but no luck. 
any thoughts on these developments?
