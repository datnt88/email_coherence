most of the answers by your own research. 
at your first link, near the bottom, the three driver items can be clicked on and then gives a thorough explanation. 
one appears to require using a raid array [multiple hard drives therefore]. the sata for ncq is native command queing. 
only way to be sure of that is go to the website of the hard drive(s) you plan to buy to check if the specific drive has/supports ncq. 
can't go by such as sata ii. that is a spec that gives about 5 special features (one is ncq] that a sata drive can have, however it makes no requirement for a drive to have any of them [seems stupid, but it is a specification, not a product]. 
thus saying a drive is sata ii is meaningless and i see very little use of the term lately. 
don't get this confused with sata 3, some say sata2 drives which are simply those that support the 300 mbytes/second speed [sata 1 was 150 mbytes/second]. 
many sata drives include ncq [but not all]. 
i'll post this and then read about what's needed for the audio. 
just got finished baby sitting a siberian husky named jazzy blue because of her blue eyes.
