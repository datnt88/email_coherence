ok, by your own history this problem has appear with old and new monitors (so it's not those) old and new graphics cards (so it's not those) what remains is the answer. 
try a different graphics lead first, as this is easiest to change and check. 
after that you get into the more problematic to pinpoint possibilities. 
it may be that your power supply is not up to the task. 
as graphics cards advance they also tend to need more power, it might be an indicator that your old graphics only suffered minor &quot;no display&quot; problems, but your new more power hungry one suffers greatly. 
as a test, with power off, unplug as many devices (such as cd-rom drives, and case fans, which with the case off aren't really needed for testing) as possible, to give as much start up juice to the graphics card as possible, and see if this tips it over to indicate a lack of power to be the culprit. 
after that, plug all those drives and case fans (never ever unplug the cpu fan!) back in, and then consider further options. 
good luck, geebee.
