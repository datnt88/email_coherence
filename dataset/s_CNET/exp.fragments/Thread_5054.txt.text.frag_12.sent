i have one pci-e x16 expansion slot. 
which version, can we say, this slot is in m2a-vm 690g chipset? is it 1.1? 
because i contacted the customer care regarding the graphics issue and they said that gt-240 shows compatibility with pci-e 2.0 x16....and i should get gt 240 replaced with 9800 gt because it shows compatibility with both 2.0 and 1.1
