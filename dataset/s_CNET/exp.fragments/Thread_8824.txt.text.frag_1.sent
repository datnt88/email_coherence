i have a samsung tv which has a cat5 connection to get to the internet. 
i have a wireless router in another room. 
i can't run a cat5 cable from the wireless router to the samsung tv. is there something i can put close to the samsung tv and connect to the cat5 cable input on the tv that would talk to the wireless router in another room which would give me internet access on the tv. rich
