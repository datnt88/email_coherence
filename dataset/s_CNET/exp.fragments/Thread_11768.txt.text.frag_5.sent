i am reading reivews online for different products. 
so i have some questions now.. athlon64 vs p4? p4 performs better in lame mp3 encoding and divx encoding; while the athlon64 performs better in xvid. 
what does this mean for an end user like myself? 
which applications will be better handled by the p4 vs the athlon64? 
these are specs for the dfi &quot;855gme-mgf&quot; i855gme chipset motherboard for intel socket 479 cpu that i found on newegg. 
what do these specs mean in terms of application and expansion?
