if these monitors are stolen (could be?) the sn# will disallow any warranty. 
in fact, you'll probably get a call. 
of course, monitors are mass produced and some models aren't always needed, thus dumped in order to generate revenue. 
if dell does this and &quot;an agreement&quot; is made between seller and vendor to honor a warranty, its usually posted. 
also, don't expect a generous warrnty. 
many a monitor gets returned for repair/problem and can't be used as new, thus sold to 3rd party sellers. 
read the fine print and any ebay seller history. the choice is yours.
