take as many pics as you can of all boards and the monitor while you have it apart. 
mainly the boards off the metal casing both sides of the pcb. 
send to aptivaa12@yahoo.com i'll edit the photo to show you what caps are bad. 
this will prevent you from sending me a board that may not be damaged as well and save yourself some postage. 
but please make them as clear as possible. 
thank you
