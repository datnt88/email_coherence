i think i see another solution. 
look up cameraa and camerab in the app store. 
what you find is that some think that because a product isn't just right for them it is no good. 
read goldilocks and the three bears lately? 
this goldilocks syndrome is best ignored and we can move to finding what &quot;this one is just right.&quot;
