hi, was looking in the wrong place for the cpu thats why i got confused !!! have ordered an e6700 cpu and an extra 2gb of ram as suggested will let you know when it arrives.. anyway now after tinkering with it my pc will not go to sleep !!! i have checked device manager everything is disabled to wake it. 
checked power options everything seems fine. 
disconnected everything from the pc and still wont sleep.. before tinkering it would turn off(sleep) after 10 mins but now after 10 mins the light just keeps blinking but it wont turn off.. any ideas ?? ta
