hi, i recently bought an expensive soundcard for my computer the creative xfi fatal1ty.... i really really like the sound card.... but i noticed that i'm not really making full use of the soundcard... because it's potential is limited by my old altec lancing 151i i'm deciding on buying good 5.1 or 7.1 speakers.... since my soundcard has coaxial output.... is it better to get speakers that support coaxial? 
my budget is around 400-600usd and i'm currently looking at 1. the klipsch promedia ultra 5.1 or the gmx d-5.1 2. the logitech z-5500 digital 3. creative gigaworks s750 7.1?(i 
dun really like this) or another way is to use coaxial and put it through an amplifier and to a home theatre system pls give me suggestions.... it will be better if you can introduce better brands within my budget... i will not game with this now but in the near future maybe... however i watch really alot of movies.. and i really like surround sound.... i would also like to listen to songs in qualities that i've never heard before...
