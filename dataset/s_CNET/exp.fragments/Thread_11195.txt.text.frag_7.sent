i've seen pics of it in the internet and it was recommended. 
now i wasted 11 dollars on this. 
i dont know how it worked before i put a new motherboard in. 
its not the usb port because another adapter i have works. 
i have the original packaging but not the reciept . 
i need some way for it to get detected. 
it keeps saying unknown device in device manager and has no !,? or x next to it. it says drivers are not installed when they are.
