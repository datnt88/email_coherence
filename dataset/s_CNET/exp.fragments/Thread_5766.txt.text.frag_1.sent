i have a hp a6330f desktop amd athlon 64 x 2 dual core 5600+ 2.8 ghz, 3.0 gb ram, 32 bit os, vista home prem serv pack 1, verizon dsl for internet. 
randomly a little box pops up in the lower right side of the screen stating &quot;analog&quot;, the the screen flashes on and off. 
i try to reboot most of the time it continues to flash on and off but does reboot. 
it does eventually stop but then starts up again at any random moment. 
i have a nvidia geoforce 6150se nforce 430 video card. 
i bought this system 1 yr ago jan. 
does the video card need replacing already?!
