they are interchangable. 
however, there are times when you should probably consider deleting the software and doing a complete reinstallation of the appropriate software for the card being installed. 
sounds lame, but that is often a problem. 
my personal home network comprises of four computers. 
the desktop is direct to the belkin pren router and there are three laptops connected via wireless. 
my laptop uses a pren card and the other two use 54g cards. 
when changing card types, i have found it much easier to uninstall and then reinstall the appropriate software. 
makes life much easier and has yet to cause me problems. 
when installing a new setup, i push for all having the same type of card and if that is not practicle, i stress the need to avoid moving cards around. 
once properly installed, life is great and very stable.
