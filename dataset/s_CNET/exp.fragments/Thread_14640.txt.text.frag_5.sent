as i stated to robert, the cheap units seemed to have flooded the market. 
all you have are the specs found on the labels to go by. i rarely ever meant a user that stated they researched(beforehand) to get the psu they needed. 
further, i haven't found too many recalls or x-brand being at fault openly. 
yes, tomshardware does some testing, but there are so many out there. the user has already build system or if oem(i think are good), they went cheap, regardless of the good advise already given. 
i see these users later or at least within 3mos.. i understand the rail side of things but explain that to a user and it seems to hit dead space. 
one reason, i try to impart at least buy a namebrand or really spent the $$$ and buy at pcpower&cooling. 
alot of people complain of oem psus being cheap but i find that not the case. 
they're simply build to supply what's &quot;needed&quot; and very little room to grow on for the product sold. 
the power issue comes up after x-years of use(wear&tear) or added devices plus the years of use. 
i find it hard to impress anyone on the simple psu side of things until it takes down the system. 
but hey, it pays for my services.
