is your goal to learn how to build a pc or to run a web page? 
example. 
our web server for close to 10 years was some pentium 100mhz with 64mb ram running an older nt windows. 
it had an 8.4gb hard disk and served up the web pages just fine. 
are you sure of your goals? 
as to the software, today i want a lamp based distro.
