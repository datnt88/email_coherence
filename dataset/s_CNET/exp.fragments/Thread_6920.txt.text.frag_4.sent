i suggest you just tweak or soup-up the system as best as possible, don't put any more money in it, other than maybe more ram upto 512mb, if possible. the systemn is still useful but when compared to 2ghz+(3ghz) systems out there, the diference is about like night&day. 
you're at the end of the road for that old system. 
it's time to get another mtrbd. 
provided you have a &quot;generic type box&quot; in order to install one. 
if oem, then get another system entirely of your liking. 
plus, faster systems can handle the demands of xp os. good luck -----willy
