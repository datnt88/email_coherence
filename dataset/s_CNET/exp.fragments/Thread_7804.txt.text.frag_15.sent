2.4 teraflops gpu power! 
1600 stream processors! 
directx 10.1. 
and on and on. 
the saphire hd4870x2 is pretty much the king of the hill in gpu`s now. 
another fellow techy here on cnet is building a pc, but with the q9550 cpu. 
i suggested he go to the core i7 920 with mobo. 
i believe that it`s a bit better for future proofing. 
not to mention overclocking and performance. 
i`ve been researching fo a while here and looking at the specs i think you should up the psu. 
650w is the minimum for this gpu, but it`s better to heve a good bit of headroom so the psu is never stressed. 
which can hurt your performance or worse. 
i would realy like to here from you when your done. 
then i can compare your build to the other cnet member. 
have fun and good luck.
