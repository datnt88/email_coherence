the usb design is such that you can short out all 4 pins and it will not fry the pc. however there are always exceptions such as a board that ignored the usb design guide or those usb memory keys that contained a virus/trojan. 
for some owners that usb virus/trojan does destroy the computer since the costs of reloading the os exceed the price of a new pc (for some out there.) bob
