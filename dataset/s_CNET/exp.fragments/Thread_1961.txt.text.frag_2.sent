i first noticed the artifacts on the fresh install of win7, no graphics driver installed yet i then installed the driver that is included in the package of the gpu, artifacts show up i then installed latest driver, still artifacts show-up last test, i downloaded a trial version of win 7, still they show up. 
i'm at my wits end.
