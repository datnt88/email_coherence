my main computer is a two-year-old toshiba laptop. 
it's my fourth personal computer since the early 1990's. 
the toshiba was an inexpensive little laptop, but has proven to be extremely fast, with an incredible memory capacity. 
i have a secondary laptop, an eight-year-old gateway, that still works remarkably well.
