what games would you like to play? the pentium 3 is a decent processor (but to play newer games like halo, or farcry you'll need a different processor) that graphics card isn't the best. 
for most games it will be fine. 
but if you want directx 9.0 (halo and other new games) you could go up to a geforce fx 5600 ultra(older, but still ok), or a 5700 ultra(new and good) if you need top performance a pentium 4 or athlon64 (both require a new motherboard, probly new memory) with one of the afformentioned graphics cards will do great. 
so what ever level you want of performane choose the hardware in tha level. 
but if you just want to play games like warcraft 3 or other games like that, your system is fine.
