&gt; i want to be able to use the drive as &gt; a regular, cd-rom game-playing and &gt; software-installing drive, a drive which &gt; would play music cds and be able to burn &gt; them as well. 
theoretically you can do all that, but ... 1) copy-protected cd's (like those used for some games) seem to work best in cd-rom drives. 
sometimes other types of drive can have problems reading those cd's correctly. 
i don't know if dvd-rw drives ever have that kind of problem. 
iac, i wouldn't worry about it too much at this point. 
it's just something to be aware of. 
if you ever have trouble installing or running copy-protected software from a dvd-rw drive, that might be the problem, in which case i'd suggest trying a cd-rom drive instead. 
2) regular audio cd's should play just fine, but you may have trouble playing a dual disc (cd on one side and dvd on the other). 
i had a lot of trouble getting my dvd-rom drive to recognize the cd side of a dual disc i bought recently. 
it didn't even see that a disc was loaded. 
some research on the 'net showed that this was not an uncommon problem. 
after putting the disc in probably 5 - 10 times the dvd-rom drive finally recognized it. 
a dvd-rw drive might have similar problems. 
i don't know. 
again, just something to be aware of.
