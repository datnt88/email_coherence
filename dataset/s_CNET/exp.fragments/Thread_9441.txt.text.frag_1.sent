i have a geforce 5200 128mb video card, and the fan has become very noisy, especially on startup. 
it is about a year old, but i can't find any warrenty information on it (manufacturer is interage, purchased at sam's club). 
my gaming consists of madden and other sports games. 
what can i do with this? 
my brother suggests unplugging the fan, but that doesn't sound like a good option to me. 
any information is appreciated.
