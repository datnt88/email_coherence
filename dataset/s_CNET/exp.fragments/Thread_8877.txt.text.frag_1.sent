i have a home wireless network with a linksys router and network card that runs on the 11b technology. 
i'm having no problems getting connection on a computer two floors below. 
my girlfriend's father wanted me to set up a wirless network in his house. 
he bought a motorola router and card that has the 11g technology. the computer he is trying to connect with is only 1 floor below but it's barely getting a signal and has trouble connecting to the internet. 
the router and computer are on opposite ends of the house but i would still expect to get a better signal than what it's been getting. 
they are probably only about 40-50ft away from each other. 
isn't the g technology supposed to give a better range than b? i don't understand why it's having such a hard time connecting. 
any suggestions?
