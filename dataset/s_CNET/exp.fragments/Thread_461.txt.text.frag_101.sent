the generic inks sold as one ink for all printers are not a good thing. 
some oem are soy based inks, some are water based, some have alcohol...in other words they use different formulas. 
the ink i buy from printer filling station is very carefully chosen to match the oem formula. 
i gladly use the ink sold by printer filling station but i feel i would be taking a gamble on the generic &quot;one ink for all printer&quot; variety.
