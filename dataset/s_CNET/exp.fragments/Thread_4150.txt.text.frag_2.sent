depends on your vendor or maker, see if there is a *back-up* procedure that will make restore or recovery cds. 
read the manual or visit thier support website for such instructions and usually this is a one time shot. 
otherwise, contact the maker now and stress the need for restore/recovery disks. 
this may involve a small cost or none, exclduing s/h fee if recent purchase. 
fyi - don't type in capitals, it expresses *loud talking/shouting* or emphessis in computer lingo.
