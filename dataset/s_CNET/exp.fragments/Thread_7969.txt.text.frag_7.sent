your issue just sounds just like the one i had, so unless there is hardware failure someone along the line, it should work. 
and it sounds like youve done all this and more, so i dont know if this will make any matter like i said, before, i did not set the router as an access point, and it sounds like youve tried it both ways. 
you are correct that there will be no internet connection present on the router status screenthats not an issue. 
againi could not get the internet shared with the router set as an access point, but that may have been before i scrapped using dns. 
found out that would not work properly with ics in my situation. 
i disabled dns and assigned 192.168.2.0 to the desktop machine connected to the internet with the modem. 
installed the internet connection sharing software on this machine. 
as i recall, i may have had to install it, remove and install it again more than once for it to work. 
now this is an older winme machine, but it works ok for the ics process. 
assigned the router 192.168.2.1. 
assigned the additional wireless and wired machines 192.168.2.2 and 192.168.2.3 respectively. 
i used 192.168.2.0 as the default gateway for the other machines so they would use the desktop machines to find the internet. 
good luck mark
