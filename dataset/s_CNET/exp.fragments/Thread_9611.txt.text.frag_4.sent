bob, i finally solved this problem.! i had to go into my network (click on the little house-windows 7) to the pc/media devices/&quot;media player&quot; and add the other drive and/or folders to the media player's &quot;library&quot;. 
seems so simple yet i thought all i had to do was &quot;share&quot; the drive/folders i wanted to see on my tv. at least with my tv; it has to be in the pc's media player library. the files are not physically in the library; they are just indexed, so to speak:)
