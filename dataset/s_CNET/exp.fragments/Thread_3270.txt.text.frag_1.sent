so i recently found a great online deal for an asus cm6870 for the purpose of using as the base of a gaming rig. 
i replaced the psu with a coolmax zu-900b to power my gtx580 gpu. 
after testing 3 or 4 games, i launched skyrim with some graphic mods and the pc rebooted. 
this happened within about 30 minutes of testing. 
after trying the game again about 15 minutes later, i realized that the audio was playing very slowly and was pitch-shifted really low. 
i also heard the fan blowing loudly, so i turned it off immediately. the back the case was painful to the touch. 
here's some info that may be useful: - the case does not have a fan in the front. 
- the psu did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way. 
- the psu did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the psu's housing. 
(i used common sense in using only connections that fit naturally) - the motherboard is pretty small (1 x16 pcie, 1 x1 pcie). 
- the case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be. 
(possibly restricting airflow) first off, did fry my gpu already? 
and why is it overheating so quickly? is it the case? the psu? the motherboard? 
could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat?
