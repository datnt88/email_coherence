first let me apologise. 
there are so many exploits i've been shown and there are more that i'll mess up a reply now and then. 
sorry about that. 
but about random connections. 
some machines are set to automatically connect to nearby aps. 
maybe this is a feature that must go away since it can be part of the exploit? 
or should we be more demanding?
