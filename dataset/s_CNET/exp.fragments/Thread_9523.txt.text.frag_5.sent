while our home uses the simple netgear it may not work for those that are fascinated by dual band or other than basic router use. 
there are some that claim it drops but it never has here. 
however you may guess it's set up exactly as noted in this forum's sticky. 
i eat my own dog food in other words. 
sadly the model you noted failed not once but twice so if the maker is having you play with mtu and more, it is not ready for the field.
