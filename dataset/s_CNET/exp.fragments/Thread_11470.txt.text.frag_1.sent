hello all, looking to upgrade my computer to psudo-gaming quality (enough to run wow) and i want to know if i max out my memory to 2 gb (1 gb per slot) and install a 80 gb hard drive (which is the maximum i can find since it does not have the 48 lba thingy that lets it exceed 137 gb) will i need to upgrade anything else such as my cpu with is currently a intel celeron? 
here's the specs page for my computer if that helps &gt;&gt;&gt; thanks, -quagmier
