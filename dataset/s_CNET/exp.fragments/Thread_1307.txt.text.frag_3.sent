thanks for your reply.... your right somehow i did a system recovery and tried to reinstall and kept bumpping heads with the files that was backed up. 
i deleated all the avg files till i was able to install it again. 
i should have made a post that i figured it out so that you could have spent your time on more important matters once again thanks for your time.
