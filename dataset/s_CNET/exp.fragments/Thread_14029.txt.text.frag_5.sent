hotrodder, thanks for the suggestion. 
i had thought about stopping services, but was afraid to because i didn't know if they would start up again automatically. 
that is a good bit of information. 
i do lean toward the anti-virus, but i did &quot;deactivate&quot; norton and zone alarm without affecting the disk activity. 
perrhaps even though those programs are halted they still do their thing in the background?
