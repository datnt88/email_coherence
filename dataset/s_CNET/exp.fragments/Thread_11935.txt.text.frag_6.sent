asus has not been the same since the bad weather in japan that nearly destroyed the island. 
asus found other supplies during the difficult time when the tf101 was being released. 
trust me, not the same asus quality we have known for years. 
i sold the asus tf101 and all it's issues basically because of the reputation that asus &quot;had&quot;. 
so, i bought the asus tf201 thinking the quality problems would be over come. 
wrong !! where's the quality control? the tf201 best points was that it made a good door stop. 
for a few extra dollars i will buy a &quot;quality&quot; tablet made by apple where the quality control is supreme.
