thanks for your help. 
i looked @ the back of my computer. 
it has 2 ports. 
they look the same size to me. 
thet each have a line that runs from the computer to the phone ports in my surg-protector strip. 
one says &quot;input&quot; & the other, &quot;output&quot;. 
would one of those be my ethernet port? 
i don't have my dsl installation kit yet. 
maybe when i get that, things will become clear. 
but if i need to purchase something to make it work, it would be nice to know in advance.
