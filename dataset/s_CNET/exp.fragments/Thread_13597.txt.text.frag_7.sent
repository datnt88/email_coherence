gpu......you have a middle of the pack unit. 
i'd leave that alone for now. 
cpu.......you have a very low end unit. 
that could use some work. 
ram.....i'll take a guess you have 6gb of low speed ram. 
if true.....that could use some work. 
only you know what the budget is and what your comfortable with doing. 
ram...50 bucks. 
cpu....100 bucks. 
if you swap the cpu it might be best to get the latest bios before the swap.
