utility that will identify your system components down to the mfg/make, series and model number of the ssd. 
armed with that info, you should be to go on the www to get the dimensional info on the ssd allowing you to find a drive of choice that fits within the dimensional limitations.

re ram...you need to check your system specs as you should use ram in matched pair....2 sodimms at 4gb for 8gbs, 2 sodimms at 8gb for 16gbs and so on. 
when you mix capacities like an 8gb sodimm and a 4gb sodimm, you usually lose the benefit of systems dual channel (128bit) operation. 
let us know how it turns out.
