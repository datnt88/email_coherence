i have an hp w2207h and a computer without vga or hdmi. the monitor only has those two hookups and my computer only has dvi-d. 
i bought a dvi-d to hdmi converter and it doesn't really work sometimes. 
when i start the computer, the signal is inactive. 
i turn off my computer and try connecting to my previous monitor that had a dvi-d hookup. the signal is there. 
then i hookup the conveter to the hp, and the signal is there. 
what's up with this?
