i understand that with 2-3 high end cards this setup will be able to burn through most games easily. 
once you are past 60 fps, the rest is really just &quot;nice to have.&quot; but i am not building this machine for epeen or to have those &quot;nice to have&quot; fps. 
in reality, even a couple games already out (crysis) or ones on the horizon will really put this machine through the paces quickly. 
my main concern is that i want a computer that will continue to produce 60 fps for about three years into the future with minimal upgrades. 
since overclocking is &quot;free&quot; (in that i can do at least some of it on my own) and since i do not mind extra fan noise, it seems like a smart way to get a lot more mileage out of the system. 
i have 3 months before college which should give me time to order, build, install, and overclock the whole setup once and for all. 
that way 1 year from now i don't have to start adding fans and try to overclock it then. 
that being said, what are people's opinions on ram? 
should i go for 2x 2 gb ddr3 faster ram or should i go with 4x 2gb ddr2 slower ram (but with better latency)? 
i am leaning towards the ddr3 for now with a possible addition of 2 more 4 gb sticks a year or two down the road. the reason i ask is that the latency throws me off a little. 
i have read some articles on it but was wondering what people thought.
