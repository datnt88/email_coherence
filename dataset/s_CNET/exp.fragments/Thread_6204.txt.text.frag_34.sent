does anyone ever turn their pc off? 
my network pc's are never off, mainly because carbonite backs them all up at night. 
my son uses dropbox and swears by it...not at it. 
he has 250 employees at the university and they all share files at will. 
he wouldn't have it any other way. 
highly recommended.
