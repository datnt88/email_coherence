lightening strikes? 
fire! 
theft! 
my, these are acts of god! if that happens you weren't meant to have a backup. 
look for those sales with rebates for 120 or 160 hd's of seagates, wds, or maxtors (whatever) for $30 and buy some usb2 external cases and make your own external hds. 
for $45 each i have six of these that i put all kinds of videos on and burn copies to dvds. 
i also have a couple of thousand vhs tapes of tv sports and shows that just fill storage containers in the basement. 
what a waste! 
if they are lost or whatever, que sera, sera! 
what's important now will be vague memories in a year. 
i have so much stored data, disks and such that i know will never be looked at again. 
after 30 years of this; going thru commodores, amigas, macs, msdos, windows and so many different storage devices it all seems moot!
