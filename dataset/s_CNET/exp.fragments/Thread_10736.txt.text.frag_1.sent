i am really confused about buying a new computer. 
i am saving up for a top of the line computer and i am stuck between 4 companies, alienware, falcon northwest, dell, voodoo. 
i am leaning towards alienware because i really like their cases(i'm a sucker for cool cases), but i have read nothing but negative things about their customer support. 
i have also read that falcon and dell both have really good tech support. 
not sure about voodoo's support. 
help please!
