here are my recommedations for mid-range pci express cards with 256mb ram that will be great upgrades for your m7570n. 
higher price = higher performance and the 7900gs for $170 is probably the best bang for the buck. 
$110: evga geforce 7600gts $140: evga geforce 7600gt ko $190: evga geforce 7900gs ko ($20 rebate avail) $205: sapphire radeon x1950pro i couldn't find the rating on your power supply so i suggest you check it. 
all of the cards above suggest a 400w unit, but the 7600gt and lower could get by with 350w. 
here's a good 430w unit for $40.
