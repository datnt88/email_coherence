i've just used the crucial system scan tool to see what available ram they offer, in the ddr2 section they offer pc5300 ram, even though it also says (on the crucial site) that my motherboard only accepts up to 533mhz ram (pc4200). 
does this mean i can make use of the higher frequency ram or will it be locked at 533mhz standard?
