thanks for the info. 
it seems like i am not the only one having this problem. 
i tried reading throught the posts but most of it was over my head. 
i am using a fujitsu fmv-820nub laptop. 
i am not sure if a patch or fix exists for that type of pc. is there any way to for me to patch or fix this problem? is there any kind of download from microsoft? 
if anyone can help me i would be most grateful
