hi there i have an issue with my desktop p.c where by it keeps rebooting when i put in a cd irrespective weather it was a original or a copy. 
i changed roms as well as ide cables and still the same problem. 
i thought it may be the os so i tried to reinstall. 
when i put in the windows disc it kept rebooting as well. 
it would get to the point where windows would load the driver, before it even gives you the option to format, and then reboot. 
i tried the hard drive in another machine and it formatted there fine. 
im at a loss and hoping some one could help. 
the mother board specs is as follows: mother board: intel d865glc/ d865peso d865pcd /d865pck ram: 512 ddr400 processor: intel pentium 4 2.53ghz hdd: wd 80gb sata samsung dvd writer and sony cd witer
