so i was wondering if it was possible to use an add-in card and the intergrated video on a motherboard at the same time..like crossfire. 
....and if the intergrated video was nvidia that was/is set up as a physx to supplement the ati add-in. 
i am not sure if it is possible i have an original physx ageia card (pci) but now nvidia owns it and maybe they would not let such a thing work.
