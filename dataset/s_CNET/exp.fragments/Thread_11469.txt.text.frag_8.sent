i've seen the region free players as stand alone dvd players. 
what i wanted to find was a slimline form factor region free dvd drive to stick it a home theater pc case (i posted a link to it earlier in the thread). 
i guess my other choice would be to buy a case that houses two dvd drives and have one for the states and one for europe.
