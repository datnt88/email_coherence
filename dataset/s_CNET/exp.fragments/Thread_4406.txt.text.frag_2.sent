as one in the laptop forum. 
but, there are enough differences in the text to make it unclear as to your goal. 
you mention being &quot;on the go&quot; but having laptops and desktops. 
as well, you ask about replacing your cable with a router. 
these are not interchangeable items. 
each does something completely different. 
you might ask that your posts be removed and put together a new one that defines more specifically what you want to do and what problems you are having.
