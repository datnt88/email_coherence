yes i looked all those specs up and the ones i was reading specifically said that the t3400 could use the ddr2-1066 but when i called dell they had a different story. 
i'm exchanging the ram at crucial for the ecc ddr2-800. 
they said non-ecc can be 667 only, ecc 677 or 800 so i went with that. the windows xp i'm using is the 32 bit, if i upgrade to xp 64 bit or windows 7, should i expect the computer to run faster? 
what do you recommend? 
thanks guys!
