once you've opened the hard drive, it can't be read by ordinary means, but there are companies that will recover the data for a price. 
i've never had need for that because i always back my data up, but i've read that these services cost in the $1000 to $2000 range. 
for most folks it's not worth it. 
since it's been 5 years for you, i'd be surprised if it were worth it to you. 
but if it is, go for it!
