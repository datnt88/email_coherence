i ran evido and housecall. 
almost immediately my connection jumped up to blazing speed. 
i ran rootkit and a lot was found, but i am not sure how to read that, so i saved the findings and printed it out so i can research the findings. 
after that i ran winsock and restarted my pc. no problems, it is perfect. the kicker is to see if it is still going strong today or if it was a coincidence that it ran well last night after the fixes. 
also, there was one grayware or malware that housecall could not delete. 
i will have to look into that too. 
i'm wondering if i should still run kazaa be gone since everything is fine. 
shouldn't hurt right? 
as long as i run winsock afterward?
