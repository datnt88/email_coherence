i have a buddy that dives in and can edit file allocation tables but he's always busy and charges a few hundred per hour for his services. 
the ontrack software is free and would tell you if it would work. 
why not? 
i didn't re-read the entire thread but i never had to repair the system volume information (read ) since that's just part of windows. 
i did run into a toasted os last year and to save some of their work without reinstalling the entire system i put the drive as a slave and deleted that directory, ran chkdsk and got lucky that a repair install of xp brought it back, but the damage was quite odd. the bottom line was they were a p2p user and took a hit.
