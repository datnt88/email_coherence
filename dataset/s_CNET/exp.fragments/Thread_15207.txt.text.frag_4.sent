of the 4 pc's i have mentioned all were custom designed and ordered from each manufacturers respective website and not store bought or out of the box. 
at the time i ordered the velocity and the alienware machines they were primarily only doing high end gaming rigs. 
as i said the alienware was doa and they gave us such a hard time about a return that i would never do business with them again. 
the velocity did &quot;work&quot; as did the &quot;hp&quot; i'm sending back now, but they ran at nowhere near the promised blazing speed that i think i have the right to expect from machines that cost so much money. the velocity was pretty terrible until i upgraded to windows 7. for the high price paid, i want quality, speed, performance and reliability. 
it's like a car. 
if i buy and pay for a bmw then i have a right to expect not not to drive like a chevy. 
my primary question...still not answered is this: what brand of gaming pc do the people on this thread have and/or recommend?
