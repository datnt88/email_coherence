i will run 3 samsung t220 screens (white and blue connectors available). the computer is windows 7 pro, with a 300w power supply; with 1 pci express x16, 1 pci espress x 1 and 2 pci slots. 
there is an onboard radeon, but i am told that it will be disabled once i add a card. the 3 monitor graphics cards are pricey and since i have the room i could use some advice on two video cards (for 3 monitors). 
i do not play any games or do any video editing or watch hd movies, but i do watch the screens all day when trading. 
probably, pretty basic cards will work (especially with the 300w power supply). 
any suggestions? 
thanks so much.
