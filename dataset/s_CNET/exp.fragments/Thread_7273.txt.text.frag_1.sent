i am having some problems with my external hdd. 
lately, when i have tried to connect to any pc, i get an error message stating that the pc's usb port is experiencing a power surge of some kind and i am not able to get the hdd to start up. 
i have tried using the usb cord from my printer but i still get the same error message. 
can anyone help me with this problem? 
thanks
