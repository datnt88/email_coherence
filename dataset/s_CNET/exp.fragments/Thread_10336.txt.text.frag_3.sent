i have an amd athlon64 with integrated ati radeon xpress 200. it has a pci express slot. 
i was gonna get nvidia but they &quot;recomend&quot; ati. 
i want to get a midrange card and cnet says the nvidia geforce 6600 gt is best. 
i'm not a big gamer so don't want the top end cards. 
ati has an ati radeon x800 xl but $300 is a bit much.
