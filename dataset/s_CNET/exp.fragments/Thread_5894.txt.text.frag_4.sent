i was wondering what the led was intended to do. 
this is why i asked if it was a &quot;power&quot; led or some other indicator. 
i know some folks just use them for lighting effects but you didn't mention that. 
i've not heard of mb &quot;power led slots&quot; but i know of fan ports which use 3 wires...the third being for auto speed control. 
i do know how to make leds light up and it only needs the two lead wires and a power source and current limiter. the current limiter is just a resistor in series with the led. 
you can either use an led resistor calculator or trial and error. 
of course an led is polarized so only works when properly biased. 
you need to figure out which is + and - but you can also do that by just applying a very small voltage from some standard 1.5 v battery to see what orientation works.
