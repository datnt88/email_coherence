sam, i appreciate your help. 
i'm sorry if my reply was a bit testy. 
this computer problem has gotten to me. 
i hooked up the new hard drive so my wife can load the drivers and programs this weekend while i am at work. 
i'll try setting the jumpers to &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; next weekend, when i am off work and do have time to work on it again.
