after making too many machines i've yet to find my stuff to arrive with no screws. 
in fact you find yourself often with too many. 
nice list and i've had no horror connection wise to the apple routers. 
yes there are those that turn on mac filters and forget but here, no horrors. 
finally, i read all this but not a word about color control. 
wouldn't we after all this analysis for all this for photo work want some sort of color calibrator?
