hi, i'm hoping someone can please get me out of a very frustrating situation ! 
i have an imac g3 500 mhz, which i recently upgraded from os 9.1 to 10.3 and then to 10.3.9, then installed os 9.2.2 running in classic. 
all running fine. 
i had earlier bought a (sound) 2nd hand lacie cdrw (&gt;18 mnths old, usb and fw) but it will only read pre-burned data cd's/play i-tunes, not write any disc in either of the os's. 
toast 5.2.2 and 6.0.6 (with 'silverkeeper') are on a lacie software cd (also formatted to install other progs in windows pc's) but toast won't show up/load/install anywhere and it didn't do so before i upgraded to 10.3. 
i've not tried firewire, just usb, because i don't have a 6 pin-to-6 pin fw cable. the lacie cdrw, incidentally, has lite-on innards and i've seen this mentioned elsewhere as a possible prob. 
area). 
i bought it because my imac's slot-loading matshita cdrw was becoming unreliable and couldn't do burns or sometimes even read pre-burned cd's. 
os 9.2.2 firmware is fully updated (if that makes any difference). 
disk utility shows only lacie cdrw but no blank media. 
os x system profiler doesn't show it either !! i've tried lacie/roxio websites but can't get anywhere. 
i don't want to buy an updated/new toast version in case that solves nothing. is the lacie software cd corrupted ?? i've checked in disk utility but any blank cd i install in the cdrw simply shows as read-only. 
the main reason i bought cdrw rather than dvd/rw is because it was to be a temporary solution to upgrading to 10.3 from 9.1. 
thanks in advance to anyone who can help solve this.
