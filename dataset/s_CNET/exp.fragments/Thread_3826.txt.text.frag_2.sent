first the machine is new enough i wouldn't check the old disk size limit issue. 
but the 20gb is getting to the age i'd begin to not want it to be my primary boot drive. 
your new 160gb drive will come with drive copy software so you can move onto that new drive. 
not only that but they'll have instructions to do that. 
this is safe too since we don't touch the 20gb but set it aside when we boot from the copy on the new 160gb drive.
