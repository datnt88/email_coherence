hi. the power supply in my antec solution slk3700-bqe has started making noise. 
a kind to rattling/grinding sound, fairly steady in frequency. 
presumably the fan. it comes and goes. the unit is just under 4 years old and runs virtually non-stop. 
i see a slight increase in cpu and mb temperatures in the monitor utility that came with the mb. and i think i hear one of the other fans increase its speed shortly after the psu starts singing. 
i suppose i should plan on replacing it. 
but do i run a risk to other components should the thing go while the computer its running? 
can anyone recommend a suitable replacement for the psu? 
hope you are all having a good thanksgiving. 
thank you! ggif
