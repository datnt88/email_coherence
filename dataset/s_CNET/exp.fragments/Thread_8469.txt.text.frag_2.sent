1. we use 80 conductor ide cables. 
2. cable select or master (i never use master but we are in crisis mode.) 3. put the drive on the master connection of the ide cable. 
4. put it on the known working ide port (unplug the dvd). 
5. check that power is connected. 
does the bios see it with either cs or master? is the cable no good? 
try it as master on the cable the dvd uses. 
next?
