i am going to buy a cheap customized dell without a modem, soundcard, (i'll get a better video cad) and without an operating system or hard drive. 
i have all the software i'll ever need so thats why i didn't want to get a brand new comp. 
my main motivation was saving money. 
i get all my support from this forum and from the net so i don't really care much about getting support from dell. 
so does my plan sound like it make sense.?
