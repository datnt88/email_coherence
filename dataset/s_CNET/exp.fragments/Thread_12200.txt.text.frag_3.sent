agp is way better than pci. 
agp = 2.2 gigabytes per second. 
pci = 133 megabytes per second. 
pci runs at 33mhz and agp runs at 66mhz. 
as for the interface, they are both parallel. 
that means data can be sent only one way at a time. 
pci-x fixes this by implanting lanes and a 4 gigabyte per second transfer.
