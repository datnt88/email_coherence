we can't help much more. 
to that i'll add kingston and corsair also offer ram for most pcs and armed with the manufacturer name, series and model number of your pc...you can go to their websites and see what they offer and recommend. 
the good thing about buying from crucial, kingston or corsair is they guarantee compatiability with your pc if you buy one of their products recommmended for your pc directly from them. 
some of their products are also available at newegg.com zipzoomfly.com, 
etc., you could buy generic ram and hope it works but in my experience you're way ahead by going with good quality brand name stuff unless you're a glutton for pain and punishment.
