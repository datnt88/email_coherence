it you upgrade to over 256 meg of ram , you may be okay with windows xp as far as ram. 
windows xp is a resource hog though, and will probably cause a system with a 400 mhz processor to run extremely slow. 
i suggest that you avoid the upgrade to windows xp on the old machine. 
have you considered buying a new desktop machine? 
what is the point of networking the old desktop? 
are there at least two people in your home who might want to use a computer at the same time?
