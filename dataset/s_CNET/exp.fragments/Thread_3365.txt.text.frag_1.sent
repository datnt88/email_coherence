hello, i have an asustek p4b motherboard, which has 3 slots for memory. 
i have 2 sticks of 512 in there and i am trying to add a third stick of 512. 
i can put in any of the 2 sticks, into any of the 3 slots (conclusion all the memory is fine and the 3 slots are fine also). 
but whenever i put in all 3 sticks of memory windows xp will not start up. it keeps trying to start up over and over again. 
i cannot even get it to start up in safe mode. 
does anyone know what might be the problem? 
thanks in advance!!
