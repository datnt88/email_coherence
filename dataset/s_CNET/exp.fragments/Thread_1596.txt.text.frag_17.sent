about mid august of 2005, best buy changed the wording in the service plan brochures. 
you get whatever benefits were listed in your brochure at the time of purchase. 
yes, the new brochures list that you only get one battery replacement for the life of the plan. 
also if you read closely as well, if the product is no-lemoned or is non reparable, it will be replaced with a product of comparable performance. 
so if your laptop was $1500 when you got it but now a $500 is the most comparable, you get the $500 one, unless you want to get a nicer one, in which case you just pay the difference between the $500 one and the one you want. 
as of early november 2005 best buy also will offer accidental damage protection as well that will cover drops and cracked screens. 
and beleive me, on a laptop it's worth it.
