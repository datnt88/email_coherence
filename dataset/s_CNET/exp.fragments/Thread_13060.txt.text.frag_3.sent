so, you approve of my idea of saving to &quot;local&quot; external drive from my laptop and then backing that up to another, remotely located external via wireless. 
speed issues not withstanding. 
my thinking is that the remotely located drive will be safer than the day-to-day drive i'll use for ripping and backing up my laptop. 
just a few weeks ago, i had a drive tumble off of my desk mid-rip. the drive and 100+ ripped cds went poof! curious...if i connect an esata external to my laptop via a pcmcia sata adapter will i get the sata speed advantages or is such just a &quot;dumb&quot; adapter, in which case i'd probably be better off with usb 2.0. 
to my question, part c, above, about the need for a world edition [or any other nas drive]... i'm wondering if i can attach a regular, non-nas external drive to my seldom used desktop and then, since it is connected to the wireless network, save and retrieve files from the external via the built in windows file and printer sharing feature. 
i'd also intend to stream lossless files from the same. 
sounds like a nas solution to me, but something tells me it's not that simple. 
on the lossless issue. 
call me paranoid, but i really want to save pristine versions of all of my cds [approx 800]. 
i figure these will serve as a) a great archive; and b) an excellent base from which to convert into whichever lossy format is in fashion 2, 3, or 5 years from now. 
btw, i'm in the us. 
looking at newegg, buy.com, or j&r for the purchases. 
just today [5/25], buy.com has issued a 7% off coupon, so that might tilt the scales in their favor.
