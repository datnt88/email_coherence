i found the problem, the tray was jammed against a piece of plastic under the tray. 
fiddled a bit and unjammed it. 
i do have another issue though. 
in os x the profiler says burning is fully supported but i can't burn files without making a disc image of the file first. the disc works fine on the mac but doesn't read on a pc. my version of toast only works on classic, do i have to get toast for os x to burn cross platform discs?
