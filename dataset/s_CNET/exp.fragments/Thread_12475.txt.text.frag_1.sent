i reformatted the hard drive on my computer and had a full backup on the maxtor one touch iii mini. 
however, the maxtor one touch iii is locked and i stupidly did not make a copy of the setup software that would allow me to unlock it and the setup software is on the locked external hard drive itself. 
i checked the maxtor web site to see if they provided a download for the setup software but it doesn't seem to be available from there. 
does anyone know where i can get a copy of this setup software? 
thanks so much!!!
