not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes. 
i have a dell dem. 
8400 running xp pro wirh all the updates. 
when i go to burn jpgs. 
to dvd everything is fine until i click on make compatable. 
it starts then i get a blue stop screen.if 
i don't click make compatiable i can open the files on my computer but it does not work on others. 
if i remember correctly i did not have this problem a few months ago. 
i reinstalled my sonic software but that did not help. 
any ideas? 
thanks
