i was given a custom built computer with xp pro. it has no plugs for keyboard or mouse only 3 usb plugs in back and 2 in front. 
i have tried plugging in a usb keyboard and a usb mouse in all but at boot in cmos it says &quot;no keyboard detected&quot; then &quot;no mouse detected&quot;. 
it then proceeds to the windows sign on screen wanting a password. 
i know the password but unable to enter or by pass the screen because keyboard and mouse are not recognized. 
any ideas?
