i do apprecitate the help that people are trying to offer here. 
however, i have a feeling that the controllers are not what is causing my problems. 
if the controller was not working properly, why would the second partition on the hard drive in question work perfectly fine? the driver for the controllers was from the xp service pack 2 from when i reinstalled the os. i don't see how that could be affecting things since the drive was working fine before. 
this brings me back to the possible cause being the flash bios upgrade that i downloaded from dell. 
there's no way i'm going to get anywhere trying dell technical support. 
i wish i could revert to my previous bios but i don't know how to do that. 
(don't think it's possible) this really sucks. 
i need to get a lot of stuff off that drive and it's driving me crazy - no pun intended!
