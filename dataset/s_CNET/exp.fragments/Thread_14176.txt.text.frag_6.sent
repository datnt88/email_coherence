actually, the vostro desktop came pre-installed with vista business from dell. 
i never did the original vista install, nor would i even have attempted doing so. 
at first i was torn between staying with xp pro and advancing to vista. 
i finally went with new technology rather than old. 
perhaps my last resort should be to contact epson directly re this matter. 
thanks.
