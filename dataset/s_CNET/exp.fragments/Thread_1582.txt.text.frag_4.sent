ahhh, there could be the answer. 
with every wireless card i have installed, it has always been necessary to install the software first, then the hardware. 
so, lets try this: 1.) shut down computer and remove wireless card. 
2.) start up computer without card. 
3.) install wireless card software. 
when prompted--- 4.) shut down computer. 
5.) install wireless card. 
6.) restart computer. 
please let us know how that works. 
good luck.
