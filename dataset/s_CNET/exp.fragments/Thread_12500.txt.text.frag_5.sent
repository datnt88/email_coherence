you're welcome. 
i have heard that the stock fan will work fine, even with mild tweaks to the chip. 
i don't use it & use a cooler master. 
i also didn't like that the heat transfer plate of my amd fan, was so small. the fan i did use, had a better coverage. 
just a note there. 
good choice to use a side fan & filter, blowing into the case. 
to many people have side fans pull out. 
which if strong enough, will reduce the flow to the chip. 
i have heard there are problems with ram over 4 gigs for xp, but don't have the actual use errors myself. 
i don't have any issues with the 4 gigs i use, but that may be because that the video borrows some. 
in reality, every program that loads, &quot;thinks&quot; it needs to have a chunk when you boot. 
so keeping the registry & drives clean & aligned, should alleviate any issues. 
i'd (google) search any compatibility issues, before making a purchase, see what comes up. 
find out if the issues (if any), are worth the fix for the gains. 
often they are. 
two gigs of ram, with a 1 gig video is a good ratio for many applications. 
i've run many high end games & video programs with a self build, with a ratio like that. 
you can always add more later :}). 
good luck on your build
