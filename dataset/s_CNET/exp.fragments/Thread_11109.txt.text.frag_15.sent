yes that points to a driver issue. 
keep in mind that if you didn't use the restore media but some other os then you often get to chat with hp what drivers and what order they need to be installed in. 
-&gt; but that's half the story. 
today we have helper applications that add support for things like enabling video ports and more. 
i can't guess which it is for this model, so back to hp. another strong nod to restore media.
