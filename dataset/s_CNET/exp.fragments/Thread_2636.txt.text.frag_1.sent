so i have been running a pc i built about two weeks ago and haven't had any real problem until just recently. the problem is this: i am listening to music from a website and all of a sudden buzzing comes from the speakers and the computer shuts down. 
twice this has happened, the first time i got a blue screen and it simply had 3 lines of text one of which stating my hardware had failed and another stating that i should contact my hardware supplier. 
the third i do not remember but it was uninformative. 
no numbers appeared and i had to manually shut down and restart. the second occasion happened about 6 or 7 hours later after being used on andd off throughout the day. 
this time however i did not receive a blue screen however and it booted up displaying the mobo logo and standard boot up procedures. 
both times i was running a game (eve online) with high graphic settings and at the time of the crashes it was minimized. 
i also was listening to music from grooveshark.com however i'm not sure that is part of the issue. 
i do have power issues but i'm not sure if that is it either as it runs quite well with several instances of the game running as well as music being streamed in the background. 
i don't recall installing anything from the point when it was working just fine to the point it has started crashing like this. 
i would greatly appreciate any help. 
additional information about my system: i5 760 processor 42nm p55 evga motherboard palit gtx 460 1 gb windows 7 64 bit 850 thermaltake black widow psu 4 gb g.skill ripjaw 9-9-9-24 500gb seagate hdd (barracuda series if i'm not mistaken.) i am using the onboard sound and have a 5.1 system hooked up
