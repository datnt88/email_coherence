i just bought a hp 8300f multi media computer. 
everything works fantastic with the expection of getting the tv to work. 
i connected my satellite tv coax cable to tv/cable input and performed the hardware wizard and at the completion of the search there is no signal detected, same for manually doing it. the tv card has dtv antennae, s-video, tv/cable, and fm ant connections. 
i am using vga output cable to the monitor. 
previously i had a combo monitor/tv with this same cable connected and it all worked fine, but now trying to run it thru the computer instead of directly into the old monitor i get no results. 
is this an id10t error? 
can anyone give me a hand? 
thanks.
