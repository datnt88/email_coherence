easily block or unblock the vents from outside the case. 
with decent active airflow and a good cpu hs fan...you should be good to go. 
you can get always leave the other existing fan installed bu unconnected and if necessary you always change to bigger lower rpm fans or better quieter fans. 
let us know how it works out.
