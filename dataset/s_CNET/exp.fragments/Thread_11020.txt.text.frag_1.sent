i have a p4 2.4 ghz (800 mhz fsb, ht) with 1 gb of ram, and 8xagp. 
i currently have an nvidia geforce fx 5200 video card with 128 mb of ram. the card is decent, but i notice it slowed down on some of the newer games i have. 
i want to upgrade, but have a limited budget (less than $200) to spend. 
i've been looking at ati's radeon 9800 pro with 128 mb of ram. is this a significant upgrade over what i have? 
i just want to make sure i'm making a decent upgrade...meaning an upgrade that will speed up the newer games out there. 
any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks, bb
