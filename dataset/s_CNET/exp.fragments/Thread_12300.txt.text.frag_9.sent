i have no objection to asking all in one for conveniance, but as i said when i do that people seem to pick and choose what they want to answer and then tell me what they want or what they seem to think i need to know. 
i took to asking specific questions in seperate posts realizing all of this. 
frequently when i ask a question i don't get an answer but rather a generic treatment of the issue it was based upon. 
i frequently if not usually already know those things. 
i am not intending to be negative. 
i know this is a voluntary forum and appreciate the assistance you give me when you can. 
i'll try to keep it simple.
