i read more of the pclinuxos user's guide and decided i'd better try a safeboot. 
there were a few reports of this or that not found, but nothing seemed fatal. 
then it displayed some text that began with something like &quot;loading gui... (and another paragraph of text that disappeared too fast to read)&quot;, then it went into the grey screen of death (i.e., nothing but a blank grey screen).
