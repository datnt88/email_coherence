so i just received two 1 gb sticks ddr2 533mhz for xmas...one is a kbyte brand...the other kingston both are 533mhz...on my computer i already had installed a 1gb stick and one 512mb stick (both kingston)for a complete total of 2gbs of ram, my pc came with a buffalo firestix 512mb 533mhz stick. 
i took out the 512 mb kingston to make room for one of the new gigs, now if i do the math right...i have in my 4 slots 3 gig sticks plus the 512mb buffalo stick...so i know i should at least have 3.5gigs of ram..but on my computer it shows that i only have 2.75 gb of ram...but i checked my bios and it says i have at least 3000mbs of ram installed....here are my specs: intel core 2 duo processor e6600 2.4 ghz 1066fsb 2x2mb l2 cache em64t asus p5n32-e nforce 680i sli chipset lga775 cpu fsb1333 ddr2 dual channel memory architecture, 4xdimm, max 8gb ddr2-800/667.533,
