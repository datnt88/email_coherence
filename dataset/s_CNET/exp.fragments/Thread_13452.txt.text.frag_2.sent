water cooling is a potential idea, assuming you have very large radiators you could use evaporative cooling, except that it won't benefit or work very well in a humid environment or if they have deep pockets, phase change would handle that fine because it's basically air conditioning to cool the cpu, but your tlaking around $1200 a unit other ideas would be large cases with lots of fans and good heat sinks, and fan filters but your basically describing a computer's worst nightmare
