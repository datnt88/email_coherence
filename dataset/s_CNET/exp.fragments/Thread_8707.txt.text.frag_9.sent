i purchased the hp color laserjet cp4525n...i love the quality of the print. 
i purched this printer with the aid of an hp small business tech and i told him i would be using up to 110 lb cardstock. 
however, the heavier paper pulls crooked (i use the manual feed) and it jams after printing more than 25 in a row...very frustrating. 
additionally, i have had issues with the postscript printer, but i think i have those bugs worked out. 
previously i used the hp 4700dn, that one definitely handled the paper better, but the print isn't as crsip and the colors aren't as vibrant. 
i did call tech support about my paper handling issues with the co4525n and was told this printer wasn't meant for 110lb cardstock...needless to say i am frustrated and would love if anyone is using one out there that works. 
i am trying to startup a small invitation business and my current production time is not cost effective.
