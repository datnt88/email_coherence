'safe' shutdown temps for a p4 would be: cpu temp 85c mobo temp 60c personally, i wouldn't waste the effort to overclock your cpu or video card. the p4d 3.4ghz is already hot-as-heck and only 1 step away from the fastest p4d so you'll have very little overhead and great potential for failure. 
as for the radeon 9600, you can get a much better card for $100. 
even overclocked, a 9600 can't approach the performance of a radeon x1600 or geforce 7600gs.
