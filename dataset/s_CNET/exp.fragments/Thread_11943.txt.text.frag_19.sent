&quot;\home is not accessible. 
you might not have permission to use this network resource. 
contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. 
access denied&quot;. 
&quot; that's your clue that there are account issues. 
for example i log onto my pc as &quot;bob&quot; but if there is a shared printer on another pc i must have an account on that pc called &quot;bob&quot;. 
this is basic windows 101 networking (not class 100) so it's quite close. 
sounds just like the old account issues. 
your comment about administrator is, well, read all the time. 
but unless the accounts are there, you get such messages. 
sometimes after you create the accounts you have to unshare and re-share the printer or folder.
