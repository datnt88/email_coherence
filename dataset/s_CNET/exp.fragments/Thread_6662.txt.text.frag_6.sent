that it's fine in dos and there is something going on with windows and that drive. it does not tell us what but when i see this i look at drivers, cables, power supplies and more. 
here's the problem. 
most owners are just owners. 
most computer makers are just makers and issue no real diagnostics. 
you've found an issue but let's see what you do next. 
i dropped a few hints but can't start a conversation about the machine because i can't find what machine this is.
