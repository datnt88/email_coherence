well i'm under the impression that if the jumper is set to anything not listed under the choices, it defaults to cs. i think i'll try it without the jumper. 
just plugged the external w/ usb to another laptop, still being detected alright but still no drive. 
so it looks like it might be something wrong when i turned it off last time.
