but i'm waiting to be corrected. 
can you tell more about the circumstances? 
this is unlikely to be a requirement in a normal home environment, like you and me live in. 
so i assume it's some business, and then of course, we're talking professional stuff like cingular and t-mobile have for their wifi offerings, and that might make a difference.
