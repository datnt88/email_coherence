although you did very well providing specs for the system, i'll need to the make and model of the agp card in the system to answer that question. 
it neesds to be determined whether the card will support that kind of resolution. 
if not, most new 128 mb agp video cards will support that kind of resolution and higher, but you also must know if the agp slot on your motherboard will support a newer spec card. 
if it's from 2002, it is possible that it's not a slot compatible with newer agp cards. 
i do suspect however that your existing video setup will support that resoution.
