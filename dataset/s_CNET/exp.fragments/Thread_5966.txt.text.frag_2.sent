do a close visual inspection of the motherboard. 
check for leaking or bulging capacitors. 
they're the small clyndrical shaped things on the motherboard. 
look at the tops, they should be flat, not rounded or domed. 
if you find this, then replacement of the board is in order. 
try running the machine with the side panel off and a small house fan blowing directly on the motherboard. 
if it shows improvement, then it's heat related. 
what configuration of memory chips? 
one stick of 256, 2 sticks of 128, etc.? memory chips can fail. 
if you have more than one, try booting with just one stick installed, then replace with another. 
best of luck
