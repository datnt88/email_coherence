with that said i need some help on this. 
it's time to upgrade but i really am not up on the current tech. 
more over, my price range is limited with a baby on the way so those of you who are patient and want to help i'd more then welcome it. 
i want to be able to play the new pc games so i want decent stuff but i know with my budget the latest and greatest is out of the question. 
i want the best bang for my buck over all. 
i was thinking of going with the athalon 64 3200. is this a good plan? 
(i love playing world of warcraft and i want this to run smoothly) i also want to know what is the difference between socket 754 and 939 pin. 
now i've figured out i probably want 939 pin but i don't know why. 
finally on this topic, what does 90nm mean? 
do i want this or the standard athalon 64 3200? 
ok, section 2 of jon's pc building for idiots. 
i need a good mother board recomendation for this processor. 
again, i want it to run games well but i don't need a ton of bells and whistles. 
i'm trying to keep this as cheap as possible but still good enough to game on. 
finally, graphic card? 
i found a sapphire radeon 9250 for $44. that sounded like a great deal but will it hold up to the most current games out? 
can i run world of warcraft on a high setting with this? 
i've been told the pny verto nvidia 6800 gs is the best bang for my buck but i wanted to stay under $100 for a video card if possible. 
oh, and once we put something together here i'll need to know what power supply to run. 
i'm sure i can figure out ram. 
i have 2 hard drives and a well ventilated custom case.
