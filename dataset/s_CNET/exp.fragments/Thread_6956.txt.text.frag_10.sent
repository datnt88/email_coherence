a lot of people are having issues getting ocz memory to work on am2 motherboards, at least on this one. 
2 or three of the seven posts say something about problems with ocz ram. 
honestly, if you're not wanting sli, i'd go with something like this asus. 
if you're looking at eventual sli, i'd get the asus m2n-sli deluxe board. 
i know i'm selling asus big, but that's cause they're good. 
i bought this board, and the only issue i have is a bios issue involving cpu temps that hasn't been ironed out yet. 
i think a few people have had ocz probs with this board too, though.
