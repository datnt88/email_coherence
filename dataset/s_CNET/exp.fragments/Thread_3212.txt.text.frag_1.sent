its my first build in awhile and im looking for some help. 
i got an asus mobo with an onboard sis 180 controller and a samsung 120gb sp1213c sata hdd. 
i plan on it being the only hdd. 
anyway, i tried to have cmos autodetect the drive like the install instructions said but that failed. 
continued to the sata menu where it did detect the drive there. 
however when i continued to try and install xp on the drive it said no hd was detected. 
thats a quick summary of where im at now and im at a loss. 
its been some time since doing something like this, so any help on what im forgetting is much appreciated.
