i have a linksys wireless-b notebook adapter (2.4 ghz/802.11b)for 
my dell inspiron 4100 computer. 
it is probably 2 years old (the adapter). 
the router is a linksys, too, and is about the same age. 
i often have a lot of difficulty connecting to the internet through this computer. 
right now, for instance, it shows connectivity very low and cannot find new ip address (repair). 
should i buy a newer adapter - i.e. do adapters wear out or go bad? 
we have another laptop with an internal adaptor which connects just fine.
