11.01 just recently came out and i loaded it on, but didn't care for it. 
i'll eventually install it, but until i get my computer up and running like i want, i think i'll stick to an operating system i'm somewhat familiar with. 
i'm very very new to linux. 
i'm not sure what happened to the link. 
here's the make and model and i posted the link again. 
gigabyte ga-p67a-d3-b3 lga 1155 intel p67 sata 6gb/s usb 3.0 atx intel motherboard
