hi, i have a dell dimension 4700 that has all stock parts and windows xp home edition 32bit. 
it is a mid tower case and i am looking to upgrade it as i want to play newer games without getting another computer. 
i was wondering if someone could help me pick out certain parts for it that are both compatible with it and will fit in my case. 
i am looking to upgrade the power supply to at least 500 watts, get a new motherboard that supports intel core 2 duo, 4 expansion slots for memory and can support pci express x16 and 2.0. 
also i want to get a good cpu that can either be overclocked or that is good for gaming (crysis). 
i know im asking for a lot but i am new to the whole upgrading thing.
