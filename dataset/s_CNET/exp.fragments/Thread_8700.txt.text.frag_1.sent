this is my situation: i am trying to set up a small wireless isp service here in tropical west africa. 
i already have a vsat connection to the internet that i use for my internet cafe. 
i am trying to extend my wireless service to some homes in the immediate vicinity (1 mile radius). 
i have installed a 15dbi omni antenna at the top of our buliding connetected to a dlink (dl-614+) wireless router. 
i also have an amplifier connected to it. 
length of cable (between omni and ap) is 98 ft. what is ideal for the end-user computer to receive good signal? 
driving around with my wireless enabled laptop, i can see my wireless network, and can connect to it but within a very short distance of the building. 
i have tried connecting from within a prospective subscriber's living room just 1/3 of a mile away and could not see the ap. do subscribers need special equipments to connect? 
how come i cannot connect with a regular wireless card or usb wireless adapter?
