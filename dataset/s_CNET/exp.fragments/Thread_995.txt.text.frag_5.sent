i tryed the power settings,turn momitor off 15min, turn hard discs off: 30 min. 
i then tryed leaving it on all the time with screen saver on. 
my wife & i went to town one day & when we came in we smelled something was burning. 
we found that one of case fans was smoking. 
we were lucky only had to replace the fan & every thing was ok . 
i allways turn the cup;s off at night or when we are gone. 
good luck to you.
