i got this computer off ebay. 
since i got it i have not been able to get a sound out of it. 
when i look in device manager it shows me an unknown pci device, and of course i have no drivers forit. 
when i download the sound drivers off the compaq website supposedly for the computer i have, no luck no sound. 
i tried diabling the on-board sound and putting in my own sound card, but that hasn't worked either. 
any other things i can try?
