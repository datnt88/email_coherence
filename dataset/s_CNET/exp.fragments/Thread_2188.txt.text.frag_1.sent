i've been looking for better cooling for my cpu lately. 
while browsing newegg i bumped into this: it says it comes with a heatsink but i don't see it. it has great reviews but i don't see how something like that can be effective. 
can anyone point out what i'm not seeing in this (besides the fact that its a zalman. 
i know they have a good reputation.)?
