any hardware if not recognized by the os requires a driver. 
a driver is just a handler for the os in identifying a particular hardware you want to attach to your pc. it has nothing to do with a hotspot. 
a provider asigns hotspots so you can access their services beyond your home connection. 
think of a hotspot as a relay station keeping you going from one point to another.
