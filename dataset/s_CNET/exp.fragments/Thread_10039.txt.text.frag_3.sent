you have the choice of either ext. 
type drive or replacing the int. 
drive. 
if you plan to replace the int. 
drive it must be a match or actually fits and uses the same i/f as the old drive. 
so, be 100% sure it will work with your laptop model#. the quick and easy method is just buy an ext. 
drive that plugs into a usb port or esata if so equipped for ease of use. 
that's it, just use as any other drive. 
i do suggest you buy the &quot;kit&quot; form so everything is all present for use.
