i would not need to make the desktop wireless since it will be a few feet from the router. 
i would like to wire it and use the laptop wireless. 
i have a $50 coupon from hp shopping, i was thinking of using it to purchase the router (linksys wrt54g) but,would i be better off to purchase a different wireless network base and use the $50 towards a carrying case for the notebook? 
you are the first person who has told me that the memory addition would work fine with xp. someone even said since i only had a 12 g hard drive there was no way to even think about xp. if i left the 98 operating system on the dell pc, would there be a lot of headaches trying to get the 2 systems to communicate? 
thanks again, its nice to know someone is still using a 1998 vintage computer like me!
