as i explored options this past weekend, i focused on netflix capability, since we already pay for a netflix account and that will be one of the primary uses. 
but i could not find a chart that compares tablets' support at a micro level. 
i did discover year-old message boards and netflix tech blogs that stated that netflix was supporting android devices (honeycomb), along with a link to a download for the tablet. 
in may 2011 pcworld listed six recommended honeycomb tablets and i assume they support netflix: xoom, transformer, iconia, flyer, g-slate and galaxy. 
i couldn't find any newer info on which tablets support netflix. 
do the ipad and nexus support it? 
what are the minimum processor requirements i should seek in order to enjoy streaming movies and tv? thanks so much for your fast response over the weekend.
