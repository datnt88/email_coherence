-well thanks, now i know that ram of 800 mhz is better. 
-to answer your question, i want 2gb of ram to be able to open different programs at the same time. 
-you say &quot;most ram is pretty much the same (at least with ddr 2)&quot; ;what other tipe of ram is out there that i could chose? 
-the games i play are: knight online, age of mythology and mount & blade. 
-the games i plan to play are: archlord, counter strike (source if posible) -my internet conection is 2112 kb/s so that's not a problem. 
now i dont want to get the &quot;last pc&quot;, but a &quot;regular to good&quot; is fine to me =d , so foget the (8800 or 2900 xt) maybe a 256mb card that is not so expensive or maybe a really good micro motherboard/case... ps:thanks for your comment and link, it helped me more than you think
