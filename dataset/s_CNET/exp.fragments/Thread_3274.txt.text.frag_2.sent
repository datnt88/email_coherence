the hardware shouldn't be a problem. 
your requirements are only moderate, so practically everything new would be fine. 
finding an english language os might be difficult on a prepackaged system. 
i just tried and on the model i chose, they only offered the french version of windows 7. so you need to find a shop that can order and install the usa version on a custom built system, without having to pay twice for a license. 
i'm sure they exist, but i don't live in france, let alone in paris, so i can't advise you. 
a very important detail is the choice of the keyboard. 
in france, normally, they use the french keyboard, that is optimized for typing all those accents (like in ). 
but the lay-out is different from the standard usa- or uk-keyboard you're used to. 
and, as far as i remember, it's azerty in stead of querty. 
gone are your typing skills. 
so even with all that french accents, you might prefer a us- or uk-keyboard (even those are different). 
what other languages are supported by the various applications you install on the machine, is dependent on the application and not on the language of the os. you can install the us version of ms word with a french dictionary on either a french or an english version of windows. 
finally, windows 7 home premium is fine for you. 
no need to pay more for the pro version. 
with dell &quot;windows 7 professionel&quot; is an extra 50 euro compared with the standard &quot;windows 7 dition familiale premium&quot; (the french version you don't want). the difference in another shop should be comparable. 
best of luck with your new machine. 
and a happy stay in paris, of course!
