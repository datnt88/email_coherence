your data will still be there but the drive will probably not boot. 
you will not be able to say &quot;oops&quot; and put it back in the old machine and have it work as before. 
why? 
i don't know how xp does it but it puts something on that drive to mark the installation as illegal. 
you get to sort that out with microsoft to get it working again.
