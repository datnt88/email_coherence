another premise of backups is that you have multiple copies. 
unless you get about 3 external hard disks and rotate amoung them, it's not a backup but just a copy. 
hope this clears that up.

allows you to make an image to dvd media and carry it away for that day you don't want to happen. 
also you can copy an image to an external if you want. 
-&gt; this is all your choice.
