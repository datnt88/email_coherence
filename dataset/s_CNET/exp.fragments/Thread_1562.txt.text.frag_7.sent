i know in the 1 setup that you guys suggested it had a tower w/450watts. 
i was just seeing is it smarter to get one over 500 or can 450 do the job. 
also anyone else have any setups that might be good for me. the only product i think i am going to go with at the moment is the evga 7600 gt graphics card so if you can think around that please let me know. 
thanks again for all your help!
