personally, i would go with st least a 400w power supply just to make sure i had enough. 
if you shop around for the best price it doesn't cost that much to upgrade to more than enough power handling capacity. 
also, i would probably skip the 10,000rpm drive and get a much larger 7200 for less money, then put my savings into loading up on ram. 
i don't do much gaming, but i do video editing which is about equally resource intensive. 
it has been my experience that maxing out processor and ram makes the most difference. 
i have three 7200rpm drives totalling 480gb internal storage - and another 360gb external storage. 
with an athlon 64 and 1.5gb ram i have had no problems with my hard drives being fast enough. 
also, i installed a dual layer dvd burner which also handles cds plenty fast enough. 
i also find that there is little difference between &quot;no name&quot; and brand name drives other than a (usually) major price difference - and i saved a drive slot by only using one drive. 
of course, these are just my opinions based on my experiences - so do with them as you wish. 
good luck.
