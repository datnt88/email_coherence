lol i completely forgot about getting one stick of 4g ram. 
i will look and see what i can get. the reason i think i chose the other one is because of dual threading. 
by my understanding two sticks of ram work together better than one? 
idk that's just what i have been told. 
i know absolutely nothing about the pins and all that. 
i just have to work that everything's going to be compatible. 
i also have a dvd drive that i had spoken of earlier. the model is a ts-h653 that i pulled out of a not very old desktop. 
will that work? 
i also need to find the model number of the psu that i will be receiving and make sure that will be compatible.
