no printer for that much lasts that many years. 
i see working ones on ebay for about 20 bucks if you want to salvage one and use up your ink supply. 
at least you have a few more names to get burned up about. 
buying a printer every few years seems to be how it goes now. 
so if you can eek out that many years on a printer you have a life time of printer makers to use and when it fails, write this every 8 years or so.
