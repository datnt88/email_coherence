thanks so much for your answer. 
i hear about people having hard drives that are really fast and have 120 gb. what exactly does this mean? 
how much ram and memory should i have. 
this amd that you are talking about is the processor right? 
2 gb is fast? 
i apologize, but i really don't know anything about all of this stuff and i do want to know so badly. 
please tell me whatever else you think would be helpful to me. 
amd is faster and better than intel pentium 4 right? 
should i keep my cd and cdrw or get new ones? 
i have heard of acer, but don't really know about it. 
anyway, thanks again and if you have the time, please inform me with more information. 
thanks chuck4456
