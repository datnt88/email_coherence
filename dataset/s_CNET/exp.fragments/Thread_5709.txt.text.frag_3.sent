hi bob, i checked the sticky which contains some pretty elementary basics for set-up. 
my knowledge base is far beyond this. 
i've worked with other wifi routers, even other d-link routers and have never encountered problems like i am encountering with the di-624. 
i bought it based on cnet's recommendation. 
there are a plethora of complaints about the di-624 out there. 
we all have the same problem. 
the radio just drops out occasionally and we lose the connection. 
i'm curious to look into a broadcom-based router so that i can install tomato firmware.
