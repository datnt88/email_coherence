the absolute minimum requirement in my opinion is a 64-bit processor. 
this is something to watich for because intel currently doesn't have a 64-bit mobile chips yet (unless you count the pentium 4, which runs too hot anyway). 
dual-core isn't too important because few applications can take advantages of dual-core. 
for the desktop: any amd chip with 64-bit will be enough (including the sempron). 
intel is ok but their chips output more heat which translates to more fan noise. 
if you absolutely need a dual-core chip, then go for the pentium d 9xx series. 
avoid the 8xx series becuase they run much hotter and a little slower. the one exception would be the 805 because it isn't as clocked as high so it's thermal output is less. 
for the laptop: currently the only 64-bit laptop chip that is out there is the turion 64. intel chips get better battery life but they don't have 64-bit support.
