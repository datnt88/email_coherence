i'm been searching the web in vain for evaluation of ups (battery backup/surge protector)devices. 
thanks for addressing the brand name question. 
any other opinions or experiences on best value and most reliability of ups devices? 
i'm shopping for high reliability for my wife's business equipment. 
money is no object -- i don't want to hear computer crash spousal complaints after one of atlanta's (very) frequent power outages. 
the os systems are xp with lots of gadgets, coaxial, and phone line attached.
