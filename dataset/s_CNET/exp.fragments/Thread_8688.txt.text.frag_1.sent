i ran spinrite 6 to test the hard drive and do any maintenance as needed. 
i didn't totally understand the different levels and used level 4 as suggested. 
i have two hard drives attached. 
they are a 40 gig and 120 gig, both ide. it took 18 hours to do both drives. 
this seems like a long time. 
can anything be done to speed this up? 
i have an amd 1.8 processor with 512 mg ram. 
also at the end i tried to read the results but the computer rebooted. 
are they saved in a file somewhere? 
thanks for your help.
