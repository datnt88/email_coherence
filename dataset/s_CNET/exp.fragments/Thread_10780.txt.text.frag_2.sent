the amd chips take a little more care in the heatsink and power supply area. 
some first time builders power up the machine without the heatsink and fry the cpu. 
they take as much time to build as other machines. 
so the cost is similar. 
if you were looking for prices, they vary by country and more. 
you should try newegg or such if in the us.
