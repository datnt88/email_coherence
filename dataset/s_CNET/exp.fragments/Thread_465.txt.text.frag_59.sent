this past spring, i decided i'd had it with crashes and other maintenance issues with &quot;microsoft windows&quot; based machines....been using them for over 10 years. 
so i decided to try the switch to an apple product. 
bought a mac mini, learned how to use os x and then sold the mini to a friend. 
i then purchased a mac pro with dual 2.8ghz processors, installed 16gb's of ram and have never looked back. 
it's powerful,os x runs smoothly and it does everything i used to do on my windows machines without the hassles. 
hd video editing, photo editing and even gaming are all fun now! 
no os or hardware is perfect but this is as close to perfection as modern technology allows.
