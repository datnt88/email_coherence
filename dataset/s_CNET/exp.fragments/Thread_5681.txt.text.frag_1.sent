hello, i'm thinking about 'donating' my old desktop to my friend for his kids to use. the timing works out well because i think i'm ready to spring for a new pc w/ dual core (or build one). 
if i were to purchase a pc from a vendor, would i be able to drop my old hard drive in and essentially have my old pc's &quot;brain&quot; running on a faster machine? 
old system is a dell p4 2.0ghz, 1gb ram running xp home edition. 
the boot drive is the garden-variety 40gb, and i have installed another hd (160gb) for storage. 
new pc would have a dual-core intel processor, but i am concerned that the bios would mess things up. 
or if it came with vista pre-installed and if i were to remove the pre-installed hd completely, would it recognize my old hard drive, be able to boot xp, and still be compatible with the motherboard and the capacity for alot more ram memory? 
i don't think i would have a problem, but figured i'd ask. 
thanks for all of your help!
