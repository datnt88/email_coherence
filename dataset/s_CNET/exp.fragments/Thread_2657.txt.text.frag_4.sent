hi, while looking at my power supply , i noticed one thing - around 10 of my capacitors on motherboard have bulged out on top and have some residue on the top. the capacitors which have bulged out were around the heat sink/processor and near the power cable to motherboard. 
could this be the problem ??? regards, png6778
