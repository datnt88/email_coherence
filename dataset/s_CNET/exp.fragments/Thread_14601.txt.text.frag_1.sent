hi i am a computer programmer and i would like to buy a big screen tv for a computer monitor. 
the question i have is this a good idea and if so which kind should i get an lcd or plasma. 
what should the specs of the tv should be ie...resolution, 1080, 720. 
i would really like to hear from anyone that has done this. 
i don't want to pay $3000 on a 1080i 50&quot; plazma tv only to find that it does not work as a computer monitor. 
please help thank you
