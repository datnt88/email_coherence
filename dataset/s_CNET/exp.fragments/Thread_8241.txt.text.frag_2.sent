that psu is too low for anyone to offer much. 
however if you accept all responsibility and risk i will share the following. 
i have a hp dv4999t with a zotac gt240 fanless 1gb pcie video card and on the watt meter it draws in total under 99 watts when running windows. 
when a game runs it pulls about 120 watts. 
this means it might be ok for your machine. 
but the risk and choice is yours.
