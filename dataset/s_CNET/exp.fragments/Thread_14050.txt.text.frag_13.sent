i recently built a new desktop running windows 7 ultimate 64bit which is hard wired to my linksys wrt160n. 
i kept getting dropped connections and limited connectivity and thought it was my isp. 
i jumped on my macbook and noticed the wireless was perfectly fine, and so was my xbox 360 connection, so it wasn't my isp. then i thought it had something to do with some software i installed on my new rig, so i did some troubleshooting with that for about a week with no luck. 
finally, i narrowed it down to the router. 
i had no connection issues with my last pc connected to the router (win7 32bit), so i figured it must be a compatibility issue with the router and the new 64bit version of windows running on my pc. problem solved: went to the linksys website and grabbed the new firmware version: v2.0.03, updated, and haven't had a problem since.
