we've 3 desktop pcs and two laptops all with xp though one desktop is xp home. 
i built the desktops and configured them. 
all share two networked printers and the network performance has been good. 
i've got one nagging problem between my desktop and the wifes t40 thinkpad. 
i don't have similar users defined on each. 
i do have simple file sharing off and have shares on both systems. 
each does at least one share allowing &quot;everyone&quot; at least read access. 
all pcs are part of the same network. 
here's the issue. 
when i attempt to access the laptop from my desktop, i am presented with a login screen and can enter my wife's username/password. 
but, if i attempt to access my pc from her laptop, i get the message that i don't have proper permissions. 
actually, this is what i'd expect from both as neither the administrator or user accounts share the same password. 
i know i could just duplicate an account to make this go away but something is different between the two. 
i'm not understanding why i get the login screen accessing the laptop from my desktop and not visa versa. is this a service or local policy issue i'm missing on one these? 
btw, hers is generally connected wirelessly but using the wired connection makes no difference.
