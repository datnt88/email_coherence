i bought a gateway fpd2275w monitor and am using it with windows vista and nvidia 8800 video card. the problem i'm having is that when i turn on the monitor it takes about 5 minutes to come on to the desktop. 
it shows a black screen with a faint gateway word and logo then it will finally come on. 
i do not have the monitor driver loaded because when i did that the picture was all full of lines even with the vista updated monitor driver from gateway. 
so i went back to the generic monitor driver in vista. 
i have all the power saving options turned off. 
i do not have the monitor software installed as it has problems with vista. 
it also had the same problem with my other video card. is there a setting within the monitor itself that would keep it from coming on? 
i noticed that the same thing happens with the same monitor in the store displays. 
the salespeople don't have a clue. 
thanks for any and all help.
