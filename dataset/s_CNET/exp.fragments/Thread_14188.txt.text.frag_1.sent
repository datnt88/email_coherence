hi, i got one of those maxtor crashes. 
i was transferring data to my external drive and my laptop got hanged. 
i had to force restart my laptop. 
after restart my laptop refused to recognise the external drive. 
also, whenever the drive is powered on or is trying to read the drive, it gives a beep sound (something like when a game starts). 
some of the partition softwares recognise the drive but they are not able to rea anything on the disk nor able to access it. 
but they do show total memory and stuff. 
i have searched this forum and tried everything with failures. 
this makes me feel its a mechanical failure. 
please advice what to do. 
i am more concerned about my data that the drive.
