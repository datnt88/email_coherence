i've found a barebone system with every thing i want, but hesitant about the harddrive bundled. 
it's a 120 gig iede maxtor ultra ata 133, but only 5400 rpm and &lt;13 average seek time. 
since i am upgrading equipment (p4 3.0 mhz, 512mb pc3200 ddr 400mhz) to speed things up; is this drive considered &quot;old stuff&quot;. 
or does ist matter.
