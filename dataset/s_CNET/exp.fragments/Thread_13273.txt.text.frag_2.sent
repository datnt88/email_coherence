you're pc usage will just divide up the internet bandwidth. 
the tv bandwidth should be carried on a separate signal multiplexed with whatever else the cable is handling. 
some add voice as well. 
theoretically, this should cause no problems. 
you're best answer should come from your provider, however. 
call them and ask.
