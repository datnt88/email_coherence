it's pretty simple why this is. 
look at the mess that printers are today. 
you find yourself installing drivers for each model. 
there is rarely a time you find that the driver for the model 860 works with the 850. 
(fictitious numbers) to cure that i would have to put a pc in the middle. 
why isn't the usual all-in-one a solution for you?
