not your model. 
it is unsupported, unsupportable and you may not find a good answer. 
for me i'd do my research on google.com to let you know how my install played out, i had to edit the bios (not trivial) and find drivers from another laptop model by the same maker. 
while it worked out, there was no increase in range. 
but i did get 802.11g capability. the old card was 802.11b only. 
i don't think such changes are for just anyone. 
for example, if they complain they are not getting helped, then they should go try a pc-card.
