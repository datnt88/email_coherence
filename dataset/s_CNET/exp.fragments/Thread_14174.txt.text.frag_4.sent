the emachines is good that it is 64-bit and future applications and win. 
longhorn is going to be 64-bit. 
also amd is better than amd as it is faster in games and are not as hot and powersucking as the pentium 4s. the t6212 graphics are upgradable with the pci express slot. also the service from emachines is not bad as when my dvd burner broke, they sent me a replacement in 4 days!
