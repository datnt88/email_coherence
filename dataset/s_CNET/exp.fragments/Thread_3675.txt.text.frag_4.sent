i've read the link you suggested re: bad caps. 
one more info, power outage is a regular occurrence in my place. 
i believe this can damage electronic equipment, but i'm still not that aware of which equipment will be easily affected by this power outage. 
thank you robert and willy! 
i'll go check my capacitors.
