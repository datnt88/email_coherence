i also have the visioneer 5800 scanner. 
i too attempted to install on win xp home machine. 
it would not work properly. 
i often got the same &quot;unlock scanner&quot; message. 
i later upgraded to win xp professional and the scanner installed and works great. 
i also installed the latest version of driver software from visioneer. 
i know this isn't a solution, but i can certainly sympathize.
