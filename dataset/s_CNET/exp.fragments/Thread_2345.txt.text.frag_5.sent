the memory interface. 
it doesn't matter what cpu(s) you have since the total memory speed will result in many seconds to traverse all that ram. 
many are just starting to comprehend that bigger (or more) ram is not going to increase speed of say some game. 
maybe you need to find where the bottle neck is rather than piling in ram as a cure all?
