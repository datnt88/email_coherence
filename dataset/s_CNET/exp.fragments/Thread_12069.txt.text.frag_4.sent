i got super impatient and decided to go for the mbr option. 
disc 3 popped up in the list of drives in the manager, along with disc 0 (my main c: drive inside the computer), and disc 1 and disc 2 which both seem to be... not present. 
those 2 might be my external portable drives i have somewhere. 
so yeah, the drive said something like &quot;unallocated&quot;, so i right clicked and asked him to... initiallize, i think (i should have taken better notes). 
he then asked me if i wanted my drive to be ntfs or exfat, and i have to say i have no godly idea what those mean, i did a quick search and got the vague idea that ntfs is more common, and picked that one. 
so after a brief bit of panic and a wizard installation, it works. 
so... yeah, if anyone still wants to explain how it works, perticularly what the difference between ntfs and exfat is, for future purposes, please feel free to post.
