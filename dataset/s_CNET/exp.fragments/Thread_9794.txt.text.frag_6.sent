you must first bring up the &quot;command&quot; window by typing &quot;command&quot; (without quotes). 
you will need to be at administrator level to do this, i believe. 
anyway, the black window will pop up with the current path which will be within your personal user folder. 
from there type ipconfig. 
you should get a listing which includes your ip address, subnet mask and gateway. 
there are other ipconfig switches but this is the basic and what to start with. 
your ip address should be either one that was manually configured or given by a dhcp server. 
your router is such a server. 
if you are connected to the router, you should see the gateway. 
that is the router's address. 
this tells you only that you are connected to the router and not much more. 
knowing the gateway address, you can get into the router's web interface if you know the username and password to do so. 
but, first off, see if you are connected to the router.
