my neighbor has wireless internet. 
i discovered this when i brought a laptop home from work and it picked it up right away. 
i can get onto the internet with no problem at all. 
now, of course i had to return the laptop but i have a dell desktop at home. it is not currently equipped to receive wireless. 
first off, is it morally/legally wrong to use his wireless connection? 
and further, what would i need to receive the wireless connection on my desktop? the desktop is a brand new dell with mcafee firewall and virus protection, which i use for my super slow dial up connection. 
i certainly do not have the resources to pay $50 a month for a wireless connection myself so if this doesn't work out, i'm keeping my dial-up.
