tiffanie, sorry to hear of your troubles. 
power supplies are fairly easy to replace & relatively inexpensive. 
but first lets test it & see if we can narrow things down. 
follow this link & you will learn how to ''hotwire'' the ps. whatever you do, do not disassemble the power supply. 
if it fails the test, follow this link to replace the ps. from the description you give, i doubt that it is the power supply. 
does the cpu cooler fan spin? 
any beeps? 
explain further about what you did with the hd. you got a message to display that you were missing the os, or non system disk? 
if you got a message, that means that you got the system to boot & your ps is ok. give us more details & good luck.
