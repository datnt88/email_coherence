i had a similar problem with almost the exact same hardware (d610 instead of the d600). 
my problem was intermittent in that sometimes my computer could recognize both usb devices at the same time, but most of the time it couldn't (very infuriating). 
i believe i've fixed it by uninstalling itunes and ipod updater, installing the latest bios update and the dell notebook system software, and reinstalling itunes and ipod. 
go to select you computer and os and find both updates under the following: flashbios updates dell latitude d610 system bios system and configuration utilities dell notebook system software hopes this helps i finally came upon this solution after trying everything else on the apple website.
