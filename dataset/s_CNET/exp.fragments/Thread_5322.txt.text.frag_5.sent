which one did you go with? 
i had a better one that had an hdmi out, but it was pci based. 
since this is an old machine, i don't have a pci slot, only agp, which is why i went with the 9250. 
really i just need one with a dvi out, though hdmi would be easier. 
i played around with it a little more last night. 
i was actually getting close to presentable, but some of the black pixels were coming in red. the flashing issues seemed to have taken care of itself somehow.
