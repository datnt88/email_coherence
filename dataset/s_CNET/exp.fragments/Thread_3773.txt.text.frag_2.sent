that may be an unanswerable question. 
however, it is likely (though by no means certain) that the plugging in of the game controller is not co-incidental. 
first, replace the mother board, and come up with just memory, cpu/fan, ps, and motherboard. 
if you get the post single beep of success, add components 1 at a time and gradually put the machine back together. 
do not however add in the game controller. 
get a cheap usb card, and plug the game controller into that, or get another game controller, if it is bad, you don't want to fry another motherboard, now do you? 
consider replacing the usb receptacle on the case, as that may also be the source of a wiring fault.
