of course, then there's sony, who took the technology and rebranded it as their own, calling it i.link. 
sony sold their own computers and they were all windows based. 
for now, i'm just using the drive with usb until a real hotfix can be delivered. 
i really prefer the firewire because it can be daisy chained with my scanner, and because when i put my system to sleep, it takes the drive with it. 
less heat generated and less power used, especially during the summer months when you have no air conditioning.
