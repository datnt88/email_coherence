chip which evga could have furnished but i know some mfgs charge for the new eeprom and shipping. 
and as someone else suggested there are also third party vendors that can provide the flashed eeprom for your system. 
you remove the old eeprom and insert the new one. 
i like the replacement eeprom solution from the mfg or the third party if that's all that's wrong with the mb. when you rma a mb, mfgs may furnish new a brand new mbw however i have seen rmas get replaced with other rma boards that weren't defective or repaired mbs including some older revisions of the board. 
ugh.
