wait till you own a dell printer. 
you have a limited resource, it's made by lexmark but dell has the rights to only dell ink cartridges. 
i did see a lexmark adapter for a dell printer but none of my friends will take a chance to see if it works. 
i too have come across fairly new printers with after market ink cart. 
and boy did it make a mess. 
to me it was'nt worth cleaning, the sopping pad was over filled and the ink was all over top to bottom with ink. 
walgreens advertise refills @ half cost but i do'nt know of any of my friends have tried it. 
test it and let us know. 
thanks ron
