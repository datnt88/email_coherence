ok, here's what is happening: vga is analog - i know. 
i said dvi or vesa, both of which are digital. 
now, maybe it is you &quot;struggling at the end of your rope&quot;....i don't know, nor do i care. 
but this has been done. 
there is a website ( ) but is in german. 
use babelfish to translate the site, you shouldn't have to &quot;struggle&quot; too much with it. 
now, before anyone else tells me it hasn't or can't be done, take a look at that site to be proven wrong! it is possible, and it is somewhat what i'm looking for, but the person on that site has only been able to get a max resolution of 640x480 and 16 colors. 
i want a minimum resloution of 1024x768 and at least 16 bit color. 
but thank you for letting me see that you don't know what you're talking about....made me laugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
