i still don't understand why i can access the other computer, and all of its shares, using an explicit ip address, but not using the name listed in my network list. 
i can do that even though i do not have a common user account on both computers. 
i guess i'm looking for a configuration item here. 
i can, of course, create the common user account, and i will give that a try.
