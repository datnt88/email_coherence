i have just installed a 400 ghd to be used strictly for backup. 
my computer sees the hd, but when i try to utilize it for a backup, i kept getting the message, &quot;unreadable&quot;. 
i went ahead and formatted it, (ntfs) and tried again. 
it will try to do the backup and then stops with a message that backup failed. 
any ideas? 
thanks, bill
