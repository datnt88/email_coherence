it maybe better simply to tear it down and as robert suggests rebuild outside the case. 
doing that and making it a simple system, basics only. 
check results if you can even get a display, etc.. the other half of this is the mtrbd. 
is kaput or hosed. 
i can't pin-point that for ya, until you try this and that. 
if this mtrbd. 
has a build-in video port, use it and see if it gets anywhere. 
reset the bios(clear it) and see if you get a display during boot-up. 
notice any &quot;beep codes&quot; speaker-on or connected or active, what is the beep sequence when power applied? 
what happens when power applied to cpu fan? 
closely inspect the mtrbd. 
for any obvious damage or bad caps, shorts, breakage or non-seated cards, etc.. don&quot;t take anything for granted. 
if possible test items on another pc, one item at a time. 
take your time, don't rush this and be sure power it off when replacing or reseating anything and use &quot;static protection&quot; procedures.
