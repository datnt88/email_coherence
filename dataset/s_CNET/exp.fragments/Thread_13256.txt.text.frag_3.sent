i understand basically how to set up the access point. 
i think my question is a little more basic. 
i need to maintain wireless g access in my home network but don't want to negatively impact the wireless n performance. 
i'm thinking that hard-wiring a wireless g access point from my wireless n router (d-link dir655) will let the router run pure n instead of downgrading the speed with g trafic. the access point will let my wii and guests to connect with g. true?
