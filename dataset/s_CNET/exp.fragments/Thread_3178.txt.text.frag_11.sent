best to install two new identical cards from same mfg, same speed, same capacity, for best results. 
total gb ram supported is set by vendor of motherboard, not the user of the system. 
exceeding the max supported ram will not work. 
if max ram is 8 gb and you have four slots, then 2 gb dimm per slot is all that is possible.
