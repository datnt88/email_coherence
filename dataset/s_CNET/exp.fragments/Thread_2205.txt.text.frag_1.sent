last week i convinced my friend to get a wireless router, i recomended either the netgear wpn824 or the smc networks wbr14-g2. 
he purchased the smc. the router worked great for a couple days after it was setup(wpa passphrase, firewall on, all settings configured for his laptop) but after that the internet access has been dropping out, the laptop can see the network, connect to it(wirelessly,dhcp address assignment)but cannot access the internet. 
if you connect it to the wired port(s) on the router it works fine. 
iv'e tried resetting the router to defaults, giving the laptop a static ip but it still drops out randomly, the only thing i can thinkof is the encryption. 
please help, or he's going to abandon wireless forever.
