interesting ideas. 
i tried updating the bios. 
didn't help, but probably good thing to have done anyway. the card wants 3.3v, but i can't find a spec on what voltage the pci bus is trying to source. 
how can i tell? 
i went through intel's web site and literature with no luck ... can you tell by looking at the board????
