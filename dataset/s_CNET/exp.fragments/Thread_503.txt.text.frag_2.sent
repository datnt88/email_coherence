hey, what needs to happen: go into properties of your printer on vista and under the sharing tab click on &quot;additional drivers&quot; and check win 98, this should do the trick. 
it might want the drivers disk to do this, if you dont have a disk, google for win98 drivers. 
this is the process to add drivers to an xp box, the vista process might be a little different, but similar, look around for similar settings or titles to the ones i mentioned.
