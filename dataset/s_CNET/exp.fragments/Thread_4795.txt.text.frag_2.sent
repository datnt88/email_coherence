go ahead and restore some hdd with the image. 
but it will not boot because of a few things. 
yes the drivers are one thing but the hp usually has a windows locked to the hp motherboard so (again we are duplicating prior discussions!) windows will not run because it's locked to that maker's board or boards. 
the common fix is to restore the backup to one hdd and then install the os to your boot hdd then after the new os is working, add the hdd with the restore and fish out your files.
