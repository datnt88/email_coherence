for example, a dvd creation software created identical dvds in 6 hours. the clone of the machine with 1g ram (the other had 512mb) finished 5 minutes sooner. 
for that, the extra 512mb was not paying off. 
i would have expected better because the dvd image is... 4.7gb. 
as to this machine lasting you years, you should buy what you need today since tomorrow we see dual-core 64-bit machines in just a month or two.
