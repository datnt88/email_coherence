&quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. 
it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines. 
&quot; a long time ago tests changing motherboards yielded single digit performance changes. 
rarely pays off. the same thing with os changes but 7 does have an edge on compatibility for now.
