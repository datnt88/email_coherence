if you reread my post, you will notice, i mentioned the &quot;autodesk listing&quot;, no prculiar chipset or type, etc.. autodesk is a business s/w that people depend on to make real products. 
while certainly graphic cards have gotten better, i wouldn't depend on just any card when the manufacturuer of said s/w implies what is needed and if on the list, great if not, move on. 
people in business don't need to play around, they want results. 
gamers on the other hand look for special needs of speed and again while graphic cards are better than past, they too aren't all cut out to be great gamer cards. 
i didn't recommend any card but i did refer what one is getting into. 
i haven't found too many gamers that are ever for long on any given system that couldn't be tweeked some more on this or that was tried. the complete opposite of a cad system, which from day one has to deliver the goods, thus it needs to be &quot;stable&quot;.
