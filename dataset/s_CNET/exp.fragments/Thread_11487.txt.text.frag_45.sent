hi bob, i am confused by your response. 
to be absolutely sure, is this statement correct: you also talked about being afraid to do secure transactions over your wireless connection. 
if the site you are working with is secure (i.e. you see in the address bar, or you see the lock icon on the bottom of the browser window), the data is encrypted end to end from your browser, over your network, to the host computer. 
this includes the transit between your computer and the wireless router. 
in short, as long as you're on a secure site, there is not an issue regarding someone seeing your secure-type traffic over the wireless. 
is it a sure thing. 
this is very important. 
if not, please explain. 
thanks, bob
