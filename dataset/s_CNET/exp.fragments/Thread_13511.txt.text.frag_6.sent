the case and card have pretty good airflow, there are six fans on the case, two of which blow directly onto the gpu. the temperature sensor i believe is working as if i leave it on the desktop it will stay at one temperature, if i go into low gpu using games the temperature slowly climbs to around the low 80's. 
it's once i get into a gpu intensive game that it shoots up almost instantly to the 100's and forces me to power down to save it. 
i will try to open it, clean it, put more thermal paste on it and then put the screws in very slowly, maybe a turn for each screw, then another turn for each screw, etc until they are all down.
