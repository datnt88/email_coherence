what is it that pc needs to do well? 
what is it this pc needs to do only acceptably? 
answering thes questions will help you narrow your options. 
you've only mentioned 3 choices by brand/configuration so you must have ruled out any others already. 
two of your configurations have 2 gigs of ram. 
most uses won't need anywhere near this amount at this time...maybe some games or high end graphics applications. 
if that's imperative, your choices are narrowed to 2. as for being on a budget, there's one thing i learned not to do and that's to buy lower end with the idea i could easily upgrade in the future. 
in the technology world, the future is no more than a few weeks away and waiting too long makes upgrading less attactive than replacing. 
buy all you can afford now for what you want to do now and in the near term....just my personal thoughts and advice...listen to others as well. 
good luck making your decision.
