your top post lead with it being new. 
now it's not new but something else. 
it's pretty hard to diagnose as it is but when dealing with dead computers the common advice remains the same. 
if in warranty, use the warranty. 
if out of warranty you have to decide if you are going to be a pc repair tech. 
there are millions of posts about fixing a dead pc. basically you swap out the most suspect part. 
if you can't tell which part then you use the old advice of &quot;replace the cheapest part first.&quot;
