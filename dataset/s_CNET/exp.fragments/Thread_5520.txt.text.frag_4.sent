to answer your question; a little more information is needed, as to what your system specs are, and how long you've been using the big water system. 
with these specifics, then we can answer your question a little easier. 
i've seen over the last couple of years; that the big water system didn't get many great reviews, seems people found that it cool any better than a high performance air cooler (many found that the pump was made too cheaply and it did tend to fail) i found an older review of the big water system &lt;i&gt;&quot; what the test shows is that yes, it can fit in a mid tower, but you will have to play with the arrangement in the case so the radiator gets a good source of air in order to be an effective cooler. 
if you are gathering parts for a new build i would look at a full tower over a mid. 
if you choose to go the mid tower route you are going to want a blow hole. 
&quot;&lt;/i&gt; another question...when was the last time you cleaned and flushed the system out; meaning take all the tubing, the waterblock, the radiator/ pump flush with distilled water, then refill with new coolant (watercooling a vehicle and a computer is not as different as people think, but all systems need a good flushing/ refilling once a year or so).
