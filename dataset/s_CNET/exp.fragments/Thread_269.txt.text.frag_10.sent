i will be wanting to add the printer to the network. 
i will only want to share folders between the 2 computers so i think that i will forego the price of the new xp operating system. 
i just have to decide if i want to spend my coupon at hp shopping for a linksys router or spend it on a carrying case. 
i will also need the interface card for the desktop. 
thanks again!
