if the usb was being plugged into the computer then a new usb port is needed. 
i believe there is a cable that runs from the external drive to a usb port so if the port is screwed up then it must be on the computer. 
this card will provide a new port without replacing the motherboard, for around $10.00. 
comprehend? 
one of those days, bob?
