given no model number and all the other details all i can write is that even gurus have trouble installing windows onto laptops. the needed drivers for motherboard and then all the other parts can take hours and if you get one out of sequence it's been known to not work. 
service counters are overwhelmed with this issue and you can see why they can charge a few hundred to install windows at times. 
i see no details in your post so all i can write is make it a warranty issue.
