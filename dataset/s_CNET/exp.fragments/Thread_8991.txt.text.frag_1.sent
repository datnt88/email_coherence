i have a thinkpad r50 laptop. 
it runs windows xp with service pack 3. i bought this laptop used for school and it seem to work well except for the wireless. 
i can't seem to bring the icons up or tell if it's working. 
i went to thinkpads (leveno) website and downloaded all the drivers i thought i might need, no luck. 
i do have a yellow question mark next to my network controller in my device manager could this be the problem. 
it has a intel 3b2100 802.11b wireless card installed. 
i do not have a start up disc. 
any help on this would be appreciated
