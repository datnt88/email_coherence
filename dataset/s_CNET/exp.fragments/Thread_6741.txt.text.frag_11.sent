takes time. 
microsoft wrote a knowledge base article which pegs this time from a few minutes to weeks. 
i expected this to fail since there was no dns and even with your change you can't expect instant results since there is still no dns and until microsoft's code runs for awhile to elect a master browser as well as all the machines to do their queries i can see where this should fail at first. 
firewalls in the norton and mcafee products are well known to keep working even when disabled so the only fix for that is to toss them out. 
i have yet to see these makers address this issue.
