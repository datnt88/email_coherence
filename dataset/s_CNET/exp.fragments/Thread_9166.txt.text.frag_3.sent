if you are aiming at a mce, it be better to stay away from the flashy gaming cases. 
a elegant, yet expensive choice, would be lian-li. 
those cases could fit anywhere and still look good. 
i don't reccomend the skinny cases (the ones that look like regular cases on their side). 
they are smaller, and it looks like they are harder to upgrade. 
just wondering, any specific reason for using intel? 
rather than amd. 
don't want to start an argument, but the benches speak for themselvse.
