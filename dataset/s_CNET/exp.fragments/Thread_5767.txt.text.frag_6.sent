firstly thank you all for your advice and help. 
i took a look at the matrox card, but it only has 128mb on-board. 
1. will i benefit from more memory on the card? 
(when loading a large image file, does this use the memory on the card, or the main system memory?) 2. how do the bits-per-channel affect me? 
other than that, the matrox card looks to be excellent. 
in response to the advice that i get a good monitor - i'd love to get the sony artisan (gdm-c520k) but it's way out of my price range. 
instead i've opted for the viewsonic g220fb.
