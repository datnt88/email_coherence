another option, which will allow support for two internal sata hard drives, is to buy a card with two internal sata ports, such as this cheap one: another issue is that while windows xp media center edition can support raid 0, i don't think it supports raid 1 (for a mirrored back-up hard drive). 
so you need a hardware solution to run raid 1, and the sata raid cards will also provide this feature.
