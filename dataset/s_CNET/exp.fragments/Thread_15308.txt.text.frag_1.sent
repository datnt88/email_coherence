i'm looking to buy a new desktop computer but it seems like a monitor is nearly 1/3 of the price. 
do certain brands crap out on you? 
what kind do you have? 
i was looking at newegg.com and there's an acer 17&quot; lcd for only $285. 
oh btw i either want a cheap lcd or a flat screen tube, at 17&quot; (under about $350. 
yeah i know it limits the lcds, that's why i'm looking more towards a flat tube.) so i would appreciate any recommendations. 
thanks.
