2. let's take on your question by asking more questions. 
if you get some android and install the kindle app, wouldn't that let you get access to that? 
and with that android i can install the barnes noble app and get stuff there as well. 
the kindle fire is a good device but i don't see it being as open as other pads but then again, you can read pdfs and more on it. 
just don't expect to find the other competitor reader software on it.
