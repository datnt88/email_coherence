i have three computers, two of them have been networked already using a hub, but aren't connected to the internet. 
i also have another computer hooked up to the internet. 
if i have a router in between the internet and the non-networked computer, can i connect the hub and the router to connect the other two computers to the intrernet? 
thanks.
