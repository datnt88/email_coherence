control panel&gt; add remove programs&gt; uninstall ati software utility. 
after i did this, everything was gone. 
i have the gateway 827gm which has the same mother board. 
i contemplated with installing a nvidia card but opted against it and installed the x700 pro. 
no complaints and no headaches so far.
