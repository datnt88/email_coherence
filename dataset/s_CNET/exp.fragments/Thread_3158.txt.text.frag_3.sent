feram was used in a design i had the luck to be involved with years ago. 
it was used because unlike eeram and flash the number of erase cycles was many millions (billions?) of cycles. 
how did this become a &quot;new&quot; technology? 
mram and feram are pricey compared to flash so i doubt you'll see it in consumer products this year.
