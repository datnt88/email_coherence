&quot;they can both be on the network just fine. 
it's just that they won't openly display their presence as stand alone devices as other pcs can be made to do.&quot; 
&quot;fine&quot; means their netbios can be resolved, which it can't in this case, unless i'm misunderstanding your issue. 
finally, do you mean to say you've already reported this issue to lacie and all they can offer is no useful advice on setting up in a multi-workgroup environment but just a warning about warranty? 
if a device won't fill your need, you shouldn't mess with the internals. 
just move on.
