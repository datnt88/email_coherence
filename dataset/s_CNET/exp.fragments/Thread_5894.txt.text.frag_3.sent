thanks for the response! 
well what i have now is a led light with the connectors being 1 + pled and 1 - led on a green and black wire respectively. 
my problem is that the motherboard power led slots are filled. 
i'm more or less just wondering if there is another way i could still hook them up. 
possibly with a 3-pin connector? 
were you saying i could hook the + power led up to the red wire of a 3 pin for +5v?
