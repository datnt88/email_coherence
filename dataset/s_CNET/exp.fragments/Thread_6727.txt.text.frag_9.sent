hey guys .. i have the same problem but worse !!! i live in egypt now and i'm going to canada the next year and i even don't know if i'll use a laptop on my studies in the high school or not . 
i agree that the macbook is a very good choice for a high school student . 
but me for example .. i like it but the 13 inch is too small and even if i bought the blach one and with a 2gb of memory i will have that 64 mb of graphics wich suck !!! so as a student and homeworks or projects its good but as a gamer or musician it's bad and by the way i can bye a good dell laptop with the same price and 15.4 inch monitor and geforce 256mb of graphics . 
so i think there are lots of people or &quot;students&quot; having this issue. 
right now i don't know what to do but i think if there is someone bought a macbook before , he can tell us about he's experiense .. oh , one more question .. on the website of apply the say for example .. &quot;as low as 50 a month &quot; ok for how long ?!!! i think that's all .. bye ,
