lets say your pc came with windows xp. since xp's boot manager didn't support over 127gb in the boot drive, you could have later installed sp2 then expanded it and tripped over this nugget. 
more at that notes this issue with &quot;windows xp.&quot; sorry if this does not apply to your machine but you didn't tell all the details.
