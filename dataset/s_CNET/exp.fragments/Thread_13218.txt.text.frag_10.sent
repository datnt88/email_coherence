only derails the conversation. 
i hope you see why that would lead to discussions other than the issue. 
my first thought is hmeon noted at (vs.85).aspx the problem is real but what to do with folk that want to bash others? 
that is, the hemon may not fix it but lead to a clue why it is so. 
if others want to bash a person for making a suggestion that could lead to another clue what's going on then what to do other than ignore that person? 
what would you do? 
i know this area only lightly but do write windows apps so it gives me a little edge when looking into this. 
if that's not good enough just say so and i'll delete my replies and unsubscribe.
