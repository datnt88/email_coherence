i've got 2 winxp desktops which have been directly networked through cabling. 
one comp has an adsl connection so it's shared thru the network. 
now i've got a centrino laptop which i want to bring in, and since the wiring slots on the desktops are taken up im thinking of going wireless. 
my laptop supports 802.11b/a. 
i want to hook up my laptop so that i can share the net connection especially, and also share my files and printer. 
whats my best option?? what hardware do i need to get?? any recommendations?? router?? access point?? about routers, something i dont understand is, my adsl modem is a usb device, does it hook up direct to the router or thru a comp? 
(any hardware independant of a comp?) also im concerned abt compatibility and performance.
