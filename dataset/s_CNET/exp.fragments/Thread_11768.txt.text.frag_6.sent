in general terms if your'e going to be doing a lot of audio work and or photo editing, the p4 cpu will do better. 
amd's primarily shine best when it comes to gaming performance and things like that... ok now to the board... i think the socket 479 is the newest one for intel so you should be able to go pretty high there. 
chipsets i think are a bit old. 
fsb about half what you'd want of you're going to be going with a fast cpu. 
imo it's best to have as fast of fsb as you can. in the case of intel that's 800 mhz currently. 
the ram is also very limited. 
at most you can have 2 sticks of ram on that. 
also it only supports pc2700 ddr ram. the sort of standard ram is pc3200 or ddr 400 so you're a bit limited there. 
slots: also limited in the graphics area. 
most of the better video cards need to have an agp 8x or the new slot pci-express x-16 slot. 
that's only got an agp4x so your'e limited in what you could do there. 
only having the 3 pci slots can be very limiting too. the ports seem ok. it might be a good move to get some usb ports for the front of the comp but that's optional. 
unless you plan on using ide devices i'd reccoment using the sata; or at least use them for the primary drives. 
i use sata for both my hd and dvd-rw. 
so you really looking at a board taht small? 
that's a rpetty small board...
