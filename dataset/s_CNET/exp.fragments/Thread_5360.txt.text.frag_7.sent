i see that no one has answered this thread with enough information. 
you will have to enable your second monitor in your display control panel. 
it's pretty easy to do. 
here is a link i found that will walk you through the process, so i don't have to type it all out: i actually have my hdtv as a second monitor so i know it works. 
it's just not automatic &quot;plug and play&quot;. 
it must be enabled. 
hope that helps everyone out!
