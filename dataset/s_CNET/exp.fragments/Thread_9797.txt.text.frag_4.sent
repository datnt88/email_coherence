acronis true image.....your hard drive must be in working condition for this to work. 
like other issues, it is best done when everything works. 
i recently installed a western digital 1 terrabyte drive and the cloning software that came with it was not compatible with windows home server or windows vista or apple's os. carbon copy for apple os. again, your drive needs to be working. 
if you have errors in your hard drive, they will not be corrected by cloning.
