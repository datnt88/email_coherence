i went out and tried to do todays &quot;weekend project&quot; except i had a problem, when i pulled out the older cooling unit, the processor came out as well, apparently it is stuck to it. 
considering the cost of getting a new processor i'm not about to force it off. 
what should i do? 
btw: the socket is a p4 478.
