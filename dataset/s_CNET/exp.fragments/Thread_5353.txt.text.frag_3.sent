ignore the firemv and quadro cards (all intended cad use), and you've only got the radeon x1300/x1550 to choose from. 
those are low-end cards. 
the real problem is the price... they're just not giving you $100 worth of performance and they're twice as expensive in the x1 low-profile form factor. for less than $100 you coud get a 'full size' 8600gt or radeon 2600xt that would be 2-3x faster than the x1300/x1550.
