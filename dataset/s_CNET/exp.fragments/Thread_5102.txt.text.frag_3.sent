noooooooooooooooooo!!!!! *sighs....takes deep breath* i love this monstrosity, lol.... it's the first printer i learned to repair... i have a canon that is vista compatible.... i was just trying to make this one work too.... if nothing else, it's a great copier, so it's still got some life left....
