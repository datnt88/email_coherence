i started helping people i know with their computers. 
now it's a small business. 
i find it very difficult to tell someone that we need to spend $40 to $60 for more ram, $80 to $100 for a bigger hard drive, $50 to $100 for a better video card, and after all of this the problem might not be fixed. 
upgrading an older pc can sometimes just be throwing money down a hole. 
if you check out the outlet sites for the major pc vendors, you can usually find a refubished pc that is much, much better than what they have for a very minimal price. 
when you add in the warranty and the new software that you get, it's very hard to pass up. 
do you spend $200 to $300 to upgrade your old pc or $300 to $500 for new one? 
it's a tough call. 
and while i don't mind spending my own money, i do have trouble spending someone else's money. 
take a good look at what you have in your pc ( cpu, memory, hard drive, cd, etc ), look at what your pc would have if you upgraded it, then look at what you can get from these sites. 
then compare all three of these lists. 
other people can offer advice, but when it is all said and done these are your dollars so you get to make the decision. 
good luck!
