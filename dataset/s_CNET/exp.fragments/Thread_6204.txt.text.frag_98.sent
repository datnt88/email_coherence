here when i delete a file on one machine the other machine pops up with a notice that allows me to save it or recover it. 
again you seem to misunderstand this is a discussion that we could try to figure out why you are losing a file without that notice. 
-&gt; but i'd like to understand why any business person would put their last copy of a file on such a place. 
all my dropbox files are not my last copies. 
even if my dropbox content vanished i wouldn't lose a single file. 
are you new to pcs and file management? 
i think you have another discussion about this where i brought up the old novel and file servers and you didn't seem to know about that.
