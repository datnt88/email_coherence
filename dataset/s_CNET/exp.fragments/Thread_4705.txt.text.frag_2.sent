dimm and module are the same for all intends and purposes, the last m in dimm stands for module. 
next, i refer to the link to better explain ddr types. 
further, your manual specifically will mention &quot;exactly&quot; what ram type you need. 
if you don't understand it, then bring it with you if ram is brought locally. 
if online, check for the required ram. 
you can google away for for detailed info. 
good luck -----willy
