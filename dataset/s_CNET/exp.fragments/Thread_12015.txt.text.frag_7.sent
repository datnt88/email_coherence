right click on &quot;my computer&quot; and choose &quot;manage&quot; to get into computer management. 
click on disk management and the drive should be there. 
1.drive marked as &quot;raw&quot; then you'll need data recovery software to retrieve your data then repartition. 
2.drive seems to be normal then you just need to assign a drive volume by right clicking it. 
if the drive does appear in disk management you should try it in a different pc or get someone to look at it.
