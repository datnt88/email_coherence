jmarchi and bob b are right. 
to expand on jmarchi i suggest, and i've seen it a thousand times, that you use this solution. 
install and use these free products every day. 
adaware (lavasoft) spybot search and destroy (patrick m. kolla) spyware blaster (javacool) avg anti-virus (grisoft) beware of fake sound alikes esp. 
copies of spybot. 
if you use kazza or i-mesh or other file share tech,delete it, run the anti-ad progs, then reinstall and note the progs that your sharing prog installs (so you don't delete them later and ruin your file share).
