the agp has a special power circuit and more. 
if i wanted to cut the costs for a special lowball pc, i'd not put those parts on or... recycle a goofed agp board into such a machine rather than scrap the run. 
no one i've met in 30 years of pc design (and i'm around my engineering friends) has ever done this.
