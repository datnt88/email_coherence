i am looking to upgrade my wireless network from a netgear mimo range max to the new n. i think i have it narrowed down to the netgear wndr3700 or the dlink dir-825. 
i really like the ability to set up a guest access point along with the more secure home network. 
another issue is the space where it will sit. 
standing up on edge it the most preferred setup. 
i am looking for speed, range and stability. 
i already have a set up for multiple drive on the network, and the printer is wireless so the usb port and network sharing on the router is not a major concern. 
also was looking to upgrade the usb pc wireless adapter for the main pc to maximize the benefits.
