yes, the ribbon has a second connector. 
thank you for the instructions. 
i havent done it yet but those were very clear, i appreciate it! 
would i be able to access the files of the programs and stransfer them onto this computer so then i could use the programs? 
that was mostly the reason i wanted to attach the hd to this computer. 
thanks again!
