as long as you're not planning on playing cutting edge 3d games a netbook is fine for casual surfing the net, photo manipulation and even music recording. 
you can always plug it into an external keyboard and larger monitor if you tire of the smaller 8.9 inch or 10.1 inch screen. 
the new acer aspire one comes with 160gb hard drive, 1 gb of ram and an atom processor for under 300 bucks. 
these specs are fine for most home users and you can't argue with the price. 
msi's u100 wind is also worth a look, i've had one of these for almost a year of trouble free use.
