based on your current needs i would go with the g model with mimo. 
here's why: 1.) your current laptop cannot use the pre-n capabilities. 
2.) since this is pre-n (in other words the standard has not yet been established) why not wait for the real n to debut and know that you have the standard, not just someones interpretation of the standard? 
of course that's just my opinion, i could be wrong.
