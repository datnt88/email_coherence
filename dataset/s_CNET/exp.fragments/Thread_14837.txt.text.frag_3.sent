lol, cool. 
unfortunately i'm looking for an internal one . 
however - i just found out that seagate actually has a new internal laptop hard drive model coming out that is exactly what i want. 
it is a 7200rpm internal 2.5'' drive with 160gb of storage. 
this is perfect for my needs - however, it doesn't seem to be out yet, even though it was announced in june...
