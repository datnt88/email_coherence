hi, i just built my first computer and it actually works!! the issue i'm having is there is no sound. the motherboard i purchased has a sound jack, so i thought i didn't need a sound/audio card. 
do i need to add a sound card, install a driver from of the cds that came with motherboard, other??? and yes, i checked the volume level on both the monitor and computer. 
here's the link to the motherboard i bought.
