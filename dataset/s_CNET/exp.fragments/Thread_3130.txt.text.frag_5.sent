i might have thought that the cooler was mounted wrong or something had come loose but the heatsink itself was so hot i couldn't touch it. 
this makes me think that the cooler isn't the problem. 
it seems heat is being transferred to the heatsink but that the amount of heat being generated is simply overwhelming the setup. 
i also don't think that would make the entire inside of the computer so hot you could fry an egg inside the case! 
there are three total case fans running so this system will stay on longer with the side on due to enhanced airflow. 
my gut feeling is that something has gone wrong with the cpu or motherboard. the 122c temp seems unbelievable to me as i didn't think a cpu would hold together, much less try to work properly, at these temps. 
i have pulled this one from service and pretty much wouldn't trust any of the components after getting so hot but am really more curious as to what could cause this as anything. 
it definitely seems like heat is coming from the cpu and cooler assembly. 
this thing heats up like a toaster oven in a matter of seconds! it has a 600 watt power supply with a 700 or so watt peak. 
every bit of this power must be going into this excessive heat generation!
