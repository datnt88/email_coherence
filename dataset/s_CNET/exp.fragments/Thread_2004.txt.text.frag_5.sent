there is no sound card, it just runs off the mother board. 
i have tried re-installing an updated driver, this did not work. the sound is faint, but gets louder as the volume is raised. 
i was thinking it had something to do with my 5.1 system frequencies not being fully supported by the mother board or something. it is very possible it is a heatsink problem. 
my buddy that installed it messed up the little plastic arms that clamp down the heatsink but said &quot;it would work fine&quot;. 
are these arms something i can replace or should i just by a whole new cpu? 
i have an intel pent. 
4 3.0 ghz on a abit m/b. 
also ... i just bought c&c 3 (i high performance video game) and 5 minutes into running it the game shuts off . the monitor says &quot;no input&quot; but the power supply and hard drive are running. 
would this be a related problem - the heatsink?
