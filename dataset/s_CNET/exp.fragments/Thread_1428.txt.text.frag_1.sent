i upgraded my pc by installing a second hard drive(new 80g old 40g) and made it an extended partition and formatted it. 
when booting up, bios recognizes the new partition and the right size and when i check by using fdisk i can see that the right letter (e) has been allocated for it and everything looks ok but windows doesnt find it at all. 
i tried computer management rescan for disks but nothing happens. 
does anybody have any ideas why this is happening and how to fix this. 
thank you!
