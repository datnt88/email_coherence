xp pro in the full retail package is 299 bucks. 
you can't beat the 35 buck or less charge from dell. 
also the units i get from dell that don't have a cd have a &quot;make restore cd&quot; feature. 
once in awhile i run into people who won't do that. 
ok, onto your other drivers. 
once we have the motherboard driver proper we can also use the old fashioned method of driver removal. 
either in safe mode and xp's driver uninstall or ati's uninstaller from now don't fret about the odd vga driver and such. 
any old windows hand will tell you to cancel and move forward. 
someday we hope microsoft will correct that. 
so that's get's us to the motherboard drivers updated, the ati dusted off and ready for the nvidia drivers. 
a very important issue is the motherboard drivers are required so other drivers can interact proper with the hardware. 
as a side note some find it overwhelming to do all this and that's why geeksquad is doing so well.
