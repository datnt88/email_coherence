from my experiences, i always check the following: 1)check any and all power connections; whether its a cable running from your psu to your mobo, or your psu to a hard-drive, one unseated cable can cause problems. 
2)as others have stated; check the fans inside your computer, not just the one on the videocard, but the other fans as well. 
an overheated computer can cause problems within your whole system. 
3)try uninstalling the latest drivers from ati; if your card worked fine with the drivers from the install disc, then use them (it's not written in stone that you have to use the latest drivers from ati or nvidia). 
4)being a gamer myself; i know from my online experiences that background processes do in fact play a role in 'game lag'. 
ati has a small program that will temporarily shut down certain background processes, until you stop the program. 
it's called ati's fusion for gaming, you can check it out here: 5)some older intel boards require that you disable the onboard graphics within the bios in order for the stand-alone videocard to work properly. 
6)lastly,if all the advice you get from here fails; then it may be that the card you have is doa, then don't hesitate to rma the card back to the manufacturer. 
it is problems like this one that keeps me playing games on my computer rather than going out and buying a console; if i run into this kind of problem on a console, i'm sol. 
if i run into this kind of problem on my pc, then i can spend a few hours and quite possibly figure out (and correct) the problem. 
even if i can't remedy this particular problem (and have to rma the part), i've still learned a thing or 2 in the process(es) of elimination.
