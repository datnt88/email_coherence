my note book battery recently has taken a turn for the worse. 
it fully charges in about 15 minutes and discharges in 5 minutes. 
the battery has been handled properly and charged/fully discharged a few times a week (the battery is only 6 months old). 
i think the problem may be w/ the power management portion of the software. 
any ideas i can try besides buying an expensive new battery?
