i am going to get a mbp from the apple store (so that i can get my skymiles too). 
i need the 4gb of ram but i see it just went up again and is now at $700. is it worth it in the end to get the 2gb and upgrade later since i will have to get 2 new 2gb dimm because the way they set-up the basic 2gb of ram, is they use both slots. 
they put 1gb in each slot. 
make sense? 
any other suggestions for a small business user who has some windows programs. 
i have not decided on vista or using the xp from the broken notebook i have. 
i did get a thinkpad t61 but sent it right back after using it a couple of days. 
any feelings on the new program that is like parallels? 
it is on the apple.com 
site called fusion or something like that? 
thanks.
