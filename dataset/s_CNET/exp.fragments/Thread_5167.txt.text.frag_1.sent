i have a dell dimension 8200 series desktop with 512 mb pc800 rdram memory, pentium 4 processor at 2.0 ghz and windows xp home os. i have a 64 mb nvidia geforce mx graphics card but i have access to a 256 mb one that i could install instead. 
i would like to upgrade this for my grandson to use to play &quot;world of warcraft&quot;. 
would it be worth it to upgrade the memory? 
what about the processer speed? 
i wouldn't need a new mother board, would i? and why would you need a new motherboard, anyway? 
any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks, kathy k.
