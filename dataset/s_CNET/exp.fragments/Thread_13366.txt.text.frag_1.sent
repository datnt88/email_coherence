currently unit is hp slimline s3100n with amd athlon 64 x2 dual core 4000+ 2.10ghz, 2gb ram, 32 bit system. 
running nvidia geforce 6150 le video card. 
video source is sony camera hdr-sr7 60gb hddd with avchd format. 
pininacle studio's (running plus v12) support told me i have to upgrade processor & video card for avchd format. 
pinnacle reccomends core 2 duo 2.6 ghz min. 
and nvidia 8800 (need 256gb or higher) my question is: what is the most effective upgrade without having to change out processors sockets, cooling fans, etc?
