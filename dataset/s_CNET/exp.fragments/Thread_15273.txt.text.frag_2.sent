so far all dsl providers will replace a defective dsl modem for free. 
i didn't read why you would want to pay for that. 
and here's a clue. 
if you go to the store and see a dsl modem+router the chances it is compatible with your telco is nearly 100%. 
you simply configure it with your name, password and provisioning information and it works.
