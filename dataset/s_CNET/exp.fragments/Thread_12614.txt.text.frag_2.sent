if purchasing a new desktop today, i'd start with an intel core 2 duo cpu. 
entry level cpu is the e6300 (2mb l2 cache). the e6600 fits my definition of a cpu sweetspot (4mb l2 cache). 
it is the cheapest with 4mb cache, which translates into a nice performance bump. 
spending more money on the offered faster clock speeds doesn't give as much a performance bump. 
check the cpu charts at tomshardware.com for performance scores. 
now, tomorrow the sweetspot will be....
