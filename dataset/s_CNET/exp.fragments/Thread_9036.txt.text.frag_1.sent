i have a shared canon mp970 attached to my hp desk station that runs windows vista. 
i have an hp laptop that also runs vista. 
i have shared the printer and i can print fine when connected wirelessly. 
however, then i connect through the eithernet cable, it will not print. 
everything else seems to work fine except printing. 
i have tried several location, tried reistalling the printer etc and i feel i must have overlooked something simple. 
my router is a d-link dir-655 n(1. 
any help would be appreciated
