&quot; i can't guess what you are trying to do but will guess you didn't want to pick up a couple more wifi client adapters.&quot; 
well, sort of, but not really... i just seem to have connectivity problems when i'm running two wireless adapters in such close proximity. 
also, the desktop in my studio is running linux, and i have not been able to get my adapter to work, despite hours of hacking and fiddling.
