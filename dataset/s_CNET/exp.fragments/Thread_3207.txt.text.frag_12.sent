crucial.com says the motherboard does not support dual channel mode. 
vs. the motherboard specifications say it does indeed support dual channel mode. the manual goes into detail with a table showing which configurations of filled memory slots will enable dual channel mode. 
whom should we trust???!! i usually go with the motherboard specifications over crucial.com. 
i'd also make sure that the motherboard bios is up to date. 
since crucial.com 
takes pride in the accuracy of its information, i guess one could contact them to help clear the fog.
