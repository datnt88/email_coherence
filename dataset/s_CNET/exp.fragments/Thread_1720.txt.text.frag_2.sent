there's not much need to desktops as the move to laptops has been very steady. 
now to tablets! 
i have a buddy that was (and still is!) in the custom desktop pc biz and it's sad to see how small his business has shrunk. 
he eeks out a meager living but it looks to be a single digit per cent of what he did just a decade ago. 
desktops are not a place to explore for new business for most folk.
