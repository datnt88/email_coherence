but the psu you bought does not have any pci-e power connections. 
it's not gonna work with your 8600 or 8800. 
keep in mind the 8600s need one 6-pin pci-e, while the 8800s need two 6-pin pci-es. 
considering the height, there is one concern: your card (if it is an 8800) is going to block the adjacent pci (or pci express) slot because it is pretty thick and covers 2 slots instead of 1. this is not a hazard or anything. it just means that the slot below (with the case upright) your 8800 card will become useless. 
if you need a good power supply which will supply enough power to your graphics card (and everything else), i recommend the thermaltake w0106ru atx 12v 2.2 700w power supply. 
you can get it on this page: .as 
you'll see, it has 2 pci-e power connections just for your graphics card(s). 
it has modular cabling so you don't have unused cables lying around in your case blocking the flow of air. 
and, it has really good reviews (about 91% positive 4star/5star reviews). 
i know its a bit expensive but you need it or something like it for your graphics card. 
hope this helps
