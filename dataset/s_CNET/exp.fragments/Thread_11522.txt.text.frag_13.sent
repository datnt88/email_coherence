don, thanks a millon for the help. 
yes, i guess i had been listening to all the horrow stories about windows xp. especially the security. 
i was glad when ms finally came out with sp2. 
i had considered using xp because of the audio and video we would be editing. 
we are a broadcast station and do a lot of cable tv programming too. 
we had decided to not replace the workstation that was hit by lightening because we needed to be able to do more audio and video editing and preparation. 
hince the rebuild with all new equipment. 
everything went fine until i cleaned the hard drives. 
now they think the data cable is not installed. 
cute huh? 
i did replace the cable that was in place with a new one. 
but all my cables are for setting jumpers to identify the drives and not cables to identify the drives as was suggested earlier. 
i'm going to go back to square one and check everything and reset the bios to recognize the primary cd/dvd burner. 
then try to install 2000 pro again from the cd. heck, we may just go ahead and get a new xp operating system. 
the main thing i don't like is the way microsoft has xp produce a code for all your equipment housed in that computer and then it's hard as heck to make changes. 
even replace a hard drive. 
i've been there when we lost a drive. 
thanks for your help.
