have just upgraded from gigabyte ga-6wmmc7 mobo with p3 cpu having on board graphics, dual screen facility easily obtained using an old amc pn 109-40600-10 pci graphics card.

new mobo is gigabyte ga-p35-ds3l without on board graphics, intel 3.2 gb core 2 duo cpu with 4 gb kingston balistix ddr2 ram. 
i bought new msi rx300hm graphics card for pci express x 16 slot. 
both graphics cards use ati drivers. 
i use windows xp home on dismantled and new systems. 
i have read the forum posts with great interest but my problem seems different. 
no matter
