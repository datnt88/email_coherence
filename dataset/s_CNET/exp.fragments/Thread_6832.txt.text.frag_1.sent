my dell notebook is set up as follows: dell e1505 intel next-gen-wireless card vista netgear wnr 834b originally the only connection i could get was to the router with limited connectivity (no internet). 
after hours with a friend in it i have an internet connection. 
strangley we couldn't get a connection when we secured the network so we just allowed my notebook mac address access. 
now everything seems to be working fine except my download speed sometimes drops to almost nothing occasionally. 
i always have an excellent connection. 
it seems to be random. 
i have read some other forums where there are suggestions that the drivers for the netgear wnr 834b are not yet toatlly ready for vista although it is advertised that way. 
any thoughts out there?
