i have several friends with xbox 360's (i prefer my pc). 
in particular one of my friends has the ms wireless adapter and another an ethernet cable. 
my friend with the wireless adapter can use easily with his network with little problems, fast download speeds and little lag. 
my friend with the wired connection on the other hand had to change his isp from tiscally to bt (in the uk this is) as only bt can do 360 ethernet connection. the wired connection caused more problems and in the end costs more because of the isp change.
