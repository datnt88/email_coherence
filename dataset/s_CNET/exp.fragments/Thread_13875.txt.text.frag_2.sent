see about moving programs and my documents to the d-drive. 
also download ccleaner (free) and use that to clean your c-drive. 
or did you do that already (you didn't tell). 
together, this might make a difference, already. 
then there might be other folders on the c-drive you created yourself, that could just as well be on the d-drive. 
that's different for everybody, so i can't tell. 
you can. if the e:-drive is still empty, and you don't use it for backup (let's assume that you have another medium to backup to, which is better), you can: a. leave it empty as long as the c and the d are big enough. 
b. move data to it (like you move data from c to d) c. find a partition utility to combine d: and e: into one big d: partition. 
totally your choice.
