hi absoluttely, i have a very old nec dvd burner single layer. 
i downloaded firmware and flashed the drive. 
now it burns +r to dvd-rom. 
also it know supports double layer recording. 
how do you explain that ?? the reason for my post is because i did it such a long time ago that i have forgotten how to do it and do not want to brick my drive. 
i just want to play videos for family who still own old dvd players that do not support +r or -r.
