with doom3 just around the corner, the video card market will take some interesting turns. 
let me share my opinion from years of video card upgrades (from pre-windows 3 days). 
don't bother with over year old cards unless you can get an exchange policy if it doesn't perform. 
it's just not worth it. 
look at other etailers like compgeeks.com and see if they offer you a nice 5700 or such that you can get the numbers on. 
i have in the house a fx5500/256m, fx5600/128m and in my machine the fx5700le/128m. 
doom 3 is on preorder and will arrive soon. 
it should be interesting to see if this under 90 buck card will be ok. bob
