the video card selection isn't in the top half over at the p3-1000 mhz is ok for many things, but you may want to keep the screen size to 640x480 or 800x600 so the game and display don't work too hard. 
and much like the spanish inquisition, installing any os may be too painful to some. 
why is this an issue?
