they explain it better: i prefer matted myself. 
its a little more costly to make a matted display but glossy with it problems or advantages they both become the ying-yang of displays. 
since, you saw the displays, check them out more closely. 
you will find if you look at an angle of a matted display, you don't see all of it proper(great security) while the glossy does reflect light. 
however, the color seems to come out more and the matted is more washed out. 
but, on very good displays, the differences become slight and really it becomes preference once you decide, do recheck them again.
