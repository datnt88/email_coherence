i bought some speakers and it improved my music quality tons. 
i purchased ev sonic xs the tend to be alittle expense depends on where you find them. 
with a 120 watt subwoffer and 2 60 watt speakers you cant go wrong. 
240 watts best clear sound they can cost from 100 to 150. 
but bose speakers which are really small and have little base but a really really crisp sound. 
i have purchased both but i enjoy the ev sonic because of the power.
