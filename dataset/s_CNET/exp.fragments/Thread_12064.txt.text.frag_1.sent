i have been using a wg111 wireless usb adapter for some number of years. 
my previous configuration (winxp pro sp2, home-brew athlon xp system) worked fine for 2-3 years. 
i recently &quot;upgraded&quot; to a dell dimension 9200 (winxp pro sp2, core2 duo, etc.) and periodically get bsod at boot time due to driver crashes. 
i have not (yet) lost data. 
in trying to track down this problem, i have seen much scathing commentary. 
i guess i just lucked out --- until now. 
i am using the latest drivers... so, is there a stable wireless g usb adapter out there? 
should i switch to pci? 
my network is stable, as there are 3-4 laptops having no problems. the setup in my house precludes a wired connection. 
thanks, al
