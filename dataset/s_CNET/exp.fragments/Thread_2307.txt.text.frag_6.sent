a workstation (even used/refurb'd) is definitely overkill. 
workstations usually use more expensive cpus and ram (any may have professional graphics card with certified open-gl support) and they won't do diddly for your intended use. 
i suggest you look into a desktop from any major brand that has core i3 or i5 for $600 and save yourself money and get a full warranty. 
any new core i5 based desktop will be faster than a two or three year old workstation.
