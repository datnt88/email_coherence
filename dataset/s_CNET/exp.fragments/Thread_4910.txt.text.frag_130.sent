add me to the group with the problematic gm5478, raise in fan speed followed by shutdown. 
after many off/on days with different tech support; gateway replaced my mother board and modum, after a few weeks problem resurfaced. 
pc would shut down with no ryme or reason 2-4 times a month, i replaced my ups to no avail. 
answers by gateway $199/yr said &quot;we can't help you, sounds like it's a hardware issue. 
i had pc 1yr and 22 days, gateway said sorry, it's out of warranty, we can trouble shoot it remote control but it will cost you almost $200. 
what's going on, i feel like we are all in some kind of &quot;twilight zone&quot; does anybody have a solution or attorney for a class action law suit.
