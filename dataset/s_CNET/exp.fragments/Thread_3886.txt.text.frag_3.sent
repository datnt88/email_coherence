i know that my motherboard does not support core2duo and that's why i will buy a p5b asus. 
but this is not the issue. 
i just want to know if it's better to buy the graphic card first or to upgrade the cpu (and the mobo) to gain better performance for the games that will come out 5 months from now, because after 5 months i will have both of them. 
i'm afraid that if i'll buy the graphic card it will be slowed down by my current cpu, or if i'll buy the cpu, i wont' get enough performance compared to buying a 8800gts. 
i really don't know and this is just for the next 5 months as i said. 
and i would also like to know if a leadtek 8800gts (640mb) will be enough for crysis (on high details and 1280x1024), and of course with an core2duo e4300 (oc at 2,6ghz) and 2gb ddr2 at 800mhz.
