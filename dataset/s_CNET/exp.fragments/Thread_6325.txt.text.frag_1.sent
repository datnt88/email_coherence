i'm a small home business user looking to upgrade my hp 6110 aio. 
i need the fax and scan options, and would particularly appreciate a model that offers a separate multi-envelope storage tray. 
i currently use windows 7 and office pro; also, can i automatically fax and receive to/from my computer?? thanks in advance.
