i am looking at the hp a450y. the cost to upgrade the processor, memory and hard drive would be $350. 
are there significant differences between the following that would warrant paying the increase in price: processor- pentium 4 3.0 ghz vs 3.2 ghz memory- 512 mb vs 1 gb hard drive- 160 gb vs 200 gb i can't speak to file size, but i can't imagine making a video longer than 20 minutes or so that would also include music. 
any feedback would be appreciated.
