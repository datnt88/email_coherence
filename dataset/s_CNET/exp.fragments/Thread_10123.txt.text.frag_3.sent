solid case choice. 
should provide a good home for upgrades down the road. 
i would consider moving to a 790i board from evga or xfx. 
or even a 780i by either. 
asus had some trouble wt 780i quality. 
nvidia 9800 xxx vidcards should see a major price drop tomorrow. 
(june 3rd open for computex) evga all ready posted a plan to drop prices on the 3rd. 
wt nahalem due out 4thq and intel planning the release of new 45nm parts for 3q your cpu is overkill. 
&quot;way bigtime overkill&quot; q9650 at q9550 price, q9400 replacing q9300 at same p point. 
e8600 at about the same p point e8500. 
step your cpu choice down by $600 to $700 ie to an e8400 or q9450 wt a plan to upgrade. 
rember a good psu wt stable voltages is the heart of every comp.
