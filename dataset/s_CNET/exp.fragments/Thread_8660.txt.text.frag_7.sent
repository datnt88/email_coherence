proposed new as well as upgrade configs where the cpu doesn't go with the mb and more often where the ram is ddr2 and mb only accepts ddr3. 
also see a fair number of instances where the psu doesn't support the hw identified or if it worked...it wouldn't have lasted long. 
wonder how the poster's build went ? 
happy new year vapcmd
