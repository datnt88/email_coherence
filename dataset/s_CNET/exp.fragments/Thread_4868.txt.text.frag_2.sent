at just 2 years with many not doing the yearly cleaning (read ) plus bad caps (google that) about half the time i find it's not drivers or pop ups. 
good sleuthing on the drivers but here's the deal. 
windows 7 is better than the prior versions on drivers but far from done. 
try the usual. 
remove the case cover and point a fan at it. the reason you make me think it is heat related is the 2 hours.
