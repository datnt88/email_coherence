windows 8 rt (restricted tablet?) is a prison where you may only install what microsoft allows and use it in only ways microsoft says you can. 
it's not a machine i would go near unless it was free and even then microsoft's attitude and more has me write it's worse than being in prison. 
at least with windows 8 pro you can install any app you find and with android it's again open to doing what you want.
