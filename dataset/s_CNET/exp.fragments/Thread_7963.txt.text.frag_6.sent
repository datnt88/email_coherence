i've been chatting withhp support and they told me that they no longer support the all-in-one range in vista. the drivers for printing are installed in vista but scanning and the &quot;hp image director&quot; software are no longer functioning. 
i'm trying to raise the issue to a new level... please find below a copy of the e-mail that i sent to the exec. 
vice chairman, todd bradley (todd.bradley@hp.com)... hello todd, can you please explain to me why your company has rendered so many of your products obsolete by not providing windows vista support. 
i am refering specifically to the psc1200 series. 
due to your lack of support this series cannot no longer be used with your own hp phot and imaging director.

team member, stefan is available for you to review. 
i await your reply
