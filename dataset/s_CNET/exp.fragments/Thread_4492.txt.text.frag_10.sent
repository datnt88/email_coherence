i can't be sure of much given the story so far but if i saw this and all was good hardware the x16 slot can tap the psu just a little harder and cause a psu to fault or drop out. 
but this is just speculation and nothing more since i can't see the machine. 
the builder of the machine if they are seasoned may mention such to you.
