hi dave, i don't have the details with me right now, but i'll try and post them later. 
i can say that the parameter is on a pre-existing line that specifies the operating system also. the symptom i saw was that the tcpip service kept stopping and restarting. 
i could always see my router. 
i just could not stay connected to it. 
sounds like your problem may be different. is your router set to broadcast it's ssid? 
i found hp's support to be very good. 
this was the first time i used them, but they didn't give me the run around and got to the problem. 
i had to have them call me back because they couldn't find the solution right away, but they did have something within one day.
