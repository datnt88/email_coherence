the mp950 looks good and uses 7 carts maybe they will release a mp980 that has the adf + fax on it. 
i'm only guessing though and the mp950 is already listed at $449 so i would hate to see how much a mp980 model would be. 
i can't imagine canon wants their flagship to be the mp780 for very long. 
keep a watch on their site for the mp980.
