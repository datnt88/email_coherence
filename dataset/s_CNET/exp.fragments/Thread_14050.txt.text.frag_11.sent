i am so excited to share this post. 
all along i thought my problem was something other than the router because i had repalced it with a new one (same model wrt160n). 
therein lied my problem the same crappy linksys. 
i bought a netgear rangemax wireless-n gigabit wnr3500 and the problem disappeared immediately. 
my network is lightening fast! 
all along they were telling me it was my isp followed by someone else's theory of 'packet loss'. 
spread the word of an outstanding product netgear as well as my tale of woe with linksys. 
i kindly thank you all for your time & feedback.
