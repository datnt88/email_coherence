adding more ram is definitely to be commended but unless you have the spare disk space you could be compounding your problems. the pagefile (into which virtual memory goes) will expand and even though you have added ram you might still get insufficient memory messages. 
if you really want to go all out to get some speed into your machine, then i would recommend going to the extreme of formatting the hard drive and reinstalling the os, drivers and all the applications. 
once you have done so make an image of the hard drive and burn it onto a cd/dvd/usb drive so when things slow down again you can just 'drop' the image onto the drive again.
