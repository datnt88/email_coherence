the system bios is set to agp, i have the 9800 set as default, but i have also turned on and off in testing the bios vga. 
nothing has changed in this computer except i went from a 9700 to a 9800pro. is there a way to reinstall the 9800 bios? it seems like it's not seeing it - only the operating system is finding it after it boots up. 
i also reinstalled the software twice.
