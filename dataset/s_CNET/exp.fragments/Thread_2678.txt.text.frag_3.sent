i didn't replace the pcb yet. 
i hope to.if 
i can find a match.& 
i did call drivesavers & even w/ a 10% discount it would still cost from 1200-2400 just to swap out the pcb. 
what is cloning a boards rom ? is this a real thing? 
there is a guy in canada who says he can do this esp. 
w/ wd drives & he has an e-bay store called ''dariusale hdd solutions''.im 
a total newbie so forgive my ignorance,but is it really possible to clone a pcb's rom?
