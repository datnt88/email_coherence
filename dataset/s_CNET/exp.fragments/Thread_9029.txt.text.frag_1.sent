so my laptop has been acting pretty weird. 
not just one, but all four of my usb ports wont accept any device that uses a usb port cable. 
not a mouse, printer , iphone cord, nothing works. 
i used to get messages that say &quot;usb malfunction&quot; but i never actually looked into it when i most likely should have. 
my laptop doesn't even make the alert sound when i plug in a usb device. 
any advice or tips of what i should do please help. 
feedback is much appreciated.
