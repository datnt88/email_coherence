please clarify what is meant by the term &quot;top directory&quot;. 
i simply attempt to send the files to the designated drive for the flash. 
i have not set up any directories on the drive. 
are you suggesting i create directories and then send my files to them as appropriate? 
thanks. 
i am rather new at this.
