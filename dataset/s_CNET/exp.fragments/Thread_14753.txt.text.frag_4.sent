such as powerquest's (now symantec owned) drive copy will do as you wish but it will cost a few $$. it will allow you to resize it's partition to fit a smaller or larger drive (within certain limits). 
it does not copy file by file but sector by sector, thus, creating a mirror image. 
xp will recognize the drive as new hardware and reactivation might be needed. 
the process will require that you physically connect both drives to channels on the mb that are accessible through the bios. 
so, if these are ide drives, you either connect one to each port or as master/slave. 
i believe norton ghost can do similar but i have no familiarity with this product.
