most important rule... take your time and read the instructions 1. open the enclosure... usually 2 screws or clips 2. make the hdd a master (may have to change the jumper settings) 3. plug in the electric plug (has a bunch of color cables) 4. plug in the flat cable and very carefully 5. set the hdd in the case making sure not to bend the flat cable to much... align it by the screw holes and screw 4 screws in... may be clips 6. close the enclosure... may have screws or clips 7. put the stand and screw it (if it's the stand up kind). 
8. turn on computer... wait for full bootup 9. plug in the usb plugs to both computer and enclosure 10. plug the electric cord of the enclosure... turn it on (in case it has an on/off switch) 11. 
wait for computer to see the hdd (may take a while) 12. once the computer sees the enclosure... wait for the whole proccess to get done... usually 3 or 4 steps... you'll see little bubbles saying that it sees, etc on lower right corner 13. my computer (right click) manage... disk management... scroll down till you see the external hdd... right click to activate (in case windows didn't see it)... format (if needed like when using an old hdd) and/or partition just my 2 cents, hope they're of help
