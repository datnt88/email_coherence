i agree with ramarc. 
it sounds like a broken adapter socket. 
i have had this problem in the past and after opening the case (which is a big pain for such a small repair)and resoldering,i cut the adapter cord about four inches from the end and rejoined with a standard small connector. 
instead of unpluging from the notenook i now undo the connector and leave the fourinch pigtail in the socket. 
i know this approach offends those with a perchant for tidieness but i rate utility over tidieness.
