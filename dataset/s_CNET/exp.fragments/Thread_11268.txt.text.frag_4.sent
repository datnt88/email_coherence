how will you be connecting the monitor to your computer? 
- vga? - dvi? - hdmi (via the videocard, if so equpped)? 
personally, i would go with the asus; in my opinion, better name, better choices for connecting to your computer, happens that a friend of mine has this exact model of monitor-he can't say enough good things about it. 
you could always check out the vendors forum sites, see how many complaints there are for each particular monitor, seriousness of the complaints.
