does anyone know if you can take a p/s right out of the box, put it on the counter, plug it in and everything should work fine or does it have to be installed? 
i bought a 400w coolmax and when i plugged it in the fan ran for a second and shut down. 
both on the counter and in the case. 
no other cables connected. 
thanks
