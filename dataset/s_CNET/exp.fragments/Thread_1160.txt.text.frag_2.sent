there are too many reasons even more so when we talk about video work. 
ok, the warranty is split into a few areas. 
yes you'll not get any warranty support for the os. it was not that good anyway as most questions end with &quot;restore the factory os.&quot; but the hardware is still under warranty with something you must know going in. 
they won't support you with a hardware issue unless you restore the factory load. 
some get upset about that but 'dems the rules'. 
while the x4500 might be slammed by some, outside of games i find it a great solution. 
my laptop with a 4500mhd connects to the hdtv with hdmi and plays hd content just fine. 
and with your i3 you'll scream past my laptop's older c2d 2.0ghz cpu.
