uzra22 gave a link to cyberpowerpc. 
i bought one of their machines a little over a year ago, and have been completely satisfied. 
shipping was prompt, but the unit arrived with one of the dvd drives damaged. 
i e-mailed, they responded, then phoned, asking if i would rather have a tech come out to install a new drive, or would i rather do it myself. 
i opted to diy, received a new drive in 2 days, and all has been great since. 
btw, the fault with the drive was probably caused during shipping. 
i also liked their &quot;configurator&quot;, which allowed me to configure one of their stock boxes to my needs. 
quality components, attractive unit. 
no complaints, which is rare for me!
