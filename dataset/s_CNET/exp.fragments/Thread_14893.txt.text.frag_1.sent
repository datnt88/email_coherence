i am doing a research project, so don't yell at me for the ungodly amount of ram. 
would a computer be better with: amd fx-8350 8-core processor at 4.0ghz and 32gb of ram or intel i7-3980x 6-core processor at 3.4/3.5ghz 
and 64gb of ram? the motherboards would be an asrock fatal1ty 990fx professional and asrock fatal1ty x79 champion respectively
