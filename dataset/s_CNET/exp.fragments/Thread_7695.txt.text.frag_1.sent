okay so i have dillema i can stick will my dell dimension 2350 or i can finsh my system build which is a aopen ax-34 pga370 pentium iii-s .yes 
i know that the specs on custom are old but i have my ways, so the main reason is the customs mobo has an agp slot and i just aquired a new evga geforce fx 5700 ultra, and i also would run that with a pny fx5200 (dual monitors. 
or i can keep the dell dimenions pci only and update the gpu to a the pny 8400 gs but its on 64 bit and pci. 
full specs dell p4 2.00ghz 1gb of ddr 2100 ram windows xp radeon 9250 (upgrade to 8400 gs) custom system specs pentium iii-s 1.4ghz(overclocked) 1.5gb of pc133(overclocked) 64mb nvidia tnt (upgrade to the fx 5700 ultra, and 5200) so what do you thnik would perform better, casual gaming, homework, web browsinf, small video edition, song converting. 
i know how much better agp is than pci (it's a x4 slot the fx 5700 is a x4 card) and it has 1.5gb of ram and pc133 is not much slower than ddr 2100. 
plus the custom is in athermal take soprano case with blue leds so its easier on the eyes than the stupid dell case. 
thanks for all the help, this is how my budget is going to have to work out for now so i want to be able to play newer games on okay quality(800x 600 is okay with me), so thanks for your help and i know this is really long. 
don't tell me to update i don't want to blow that much money i can spend 460 bucks max so it's either a new graphics card for dell, or custom only, not a new system, i now this is not an epic powerful gaming machine. 
thanks, bigboy
