i'm running windows xp home edition and i've installed the ati radeon 9600 se video card but im having some toruble. 
when i installed it everything seemed to go fine, windows found the hardware and installed it. 
but when i tried to install the drivers and software that are on the cd it says the following: &quot;inf error, video driver not found, click ok&quot; and when i click ok it says the following &quot;try to set up your display adapter with a standard vga driver before running setup.&quot; 
ive tried downloading the drivers directly from the ati site but i cant get anything to work. the video card isnt busted or anything, im using it right now but i just dont know what to do.
