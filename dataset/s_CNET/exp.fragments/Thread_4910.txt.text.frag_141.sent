my guess is that this could be the fan on the graphics card, power supply or cpu. 
my graphics card died about 6 months ago but i can't recall if i heard that sound before it did. 
my previous two computers both eventually started making an annoying intermittent hum/groan but after a couple years of this for each, they were still running just fine. 
like you, i could make it stop by whacking the chassis (but not too hard - i didn't want to crash the hard drive). 
i heard somewhere it was probably the power supply fan.
