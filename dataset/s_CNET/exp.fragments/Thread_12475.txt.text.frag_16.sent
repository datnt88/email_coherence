hi sharky168, not sure which size drive you have or production version, as you say, but here is the entire text of the message i got from seagate: &quot;i am not sure where you got the software, because we didn't put it on the public website. 
therefore please refer to the below link and download the software. 
please disconnect the drive when you install the software. 
in addition, that is normal if the drive was locked, you won't be able to see the drive in my computer. 
if you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact us. 
in order to allow us to deal with all enquiries as efficiently and accurately as possible we would ask that you include any previous emails when replying to us. 
kind regards, alexa zhou apac technical support team, seagate technologies rep. 
of ireland&quot; if the software doesn't work for your model, i would definitely contact seagate. 
they did apologize for taking so long to respond to me and said they had some kind of server problem so you may get a much faster response than i did. 
good luck!!!
