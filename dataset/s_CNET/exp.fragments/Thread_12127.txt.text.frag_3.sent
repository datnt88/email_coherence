when faced with a dead as a doornail system i strip it down to 4 parts. 
1. motherboard. 
2. cpu plus hsf (heatsink/fan). 
3. power supply. 
4. speaker. 
no case, no ram, no extra cables. 
just those four pieces on a square of non-conductive cardboard. 
i use a jumper to power it up and hope to beeps. 
power down. 
if i get beeps i can add a minimum amount of ram and try again... more beeps is good. 
power down. 
a video card and hopefully more beeps and a display output. 
i then move that back to the case and check that no metal standoffs are where they shouldn't be. 
if you can't get beeps with the 4 items above, then you have narrowed it down to those 4 items are either dead or grossly misconfigured. 
happy hunting, bob
