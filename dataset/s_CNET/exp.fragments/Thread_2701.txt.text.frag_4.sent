and clicking it takes me to and 404 not found. the p4m800 is many years old so for now my advice is a good cleaning, replace all heatsink compound, check fans and if the psu is over 4 years old, replace that with same rating but add 100 more watts. the reason why is well discussed but given the lack of detail in this discussion i have to move to the usual answer for an old pc. bob
