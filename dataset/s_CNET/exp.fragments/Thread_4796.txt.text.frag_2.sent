the tool you used has some reports of wiping out the owners setup. 
looks like you get to start over. 
sorry to read such posts. 
let me state that some overdo &quot;defragmenting.&quot; in fact, some owners seem to spend almost all their computer time running defrag programs. 
without any sugarcoating, this may be your lesson that even the simple defrag that xp came with, would be used about weekly and if more than that, then you need to reappraise why you have this pc and os. sorry if that seems harsh, but as i noted, i didn't sugarcoat it. 
some will note a loss of performance with just a minor amount of fragmentation. 
too often i find that dma isn't really working or the motherboard drivers were not installed.
