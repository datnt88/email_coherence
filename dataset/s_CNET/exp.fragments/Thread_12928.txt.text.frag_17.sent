i am experiencing a similar problem. 
when i power on the system, the power light comes on but it doesn't boot. 
i have to hit the reset buttton. 
i replaced the motherboard and the power supply. 
i am now using a (450w power supply. 
however i am still getting the problem. the only thing that i have not replace is the cpu. 
my feeling is that the problem must be cpu related in one way or another
