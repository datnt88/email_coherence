because thinking about it there house deisgn is different. 
i suppose i could get a router and give it ago. 
then if it's a bust, then look into adding wired wap. 
excuse the basic ?'s if i have very good cordless phone reception from reciever base to other rooms (where i would need wifi access) - would this not suggest that the wifi router might work? 
if i had to go wired. 
i would need to buy a couple of extra routers + cable and then configure these as access points - is this simple to do? 
cheers
