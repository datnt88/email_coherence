keep in mind i like the word backup but these externals are still not reliable enough to call them storage. 
they are pretty reliable but one drop or oops delete and your last copy is gone. 
i see many under 99 buck externals on amazon,. 
newegg and at the stores so it's easy to get one and backup what you have today.
