i have been custom building my own pc's for about 6 years. 
considering the vid card your using needs a minimum 300w ps i would want a little more than 350. 
i would reccomend the antec true power 550 it's what i use. 
a very solid ps good value and gives you a lot more upgrade abilty w/o a new ps. 
try to always be forward looking. 
good luck.
