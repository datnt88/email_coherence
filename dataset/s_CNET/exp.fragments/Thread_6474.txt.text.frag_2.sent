the printer is shared with full control? 
go to the printer properties. 
add the everyone group on the security tab. 
this should give access to the printer to umm everyone. 
setting up the printer... go thru network places&gt;entire network&gt;microsoft networks&gt;your desktop machine name&gt;your printer share name. 
double-click the printer share and it should ask you if you want to install the printer. 
hope this helps.
