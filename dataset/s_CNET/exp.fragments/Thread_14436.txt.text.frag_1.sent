i got two laptops running xphome (computer a and computer b) i got computer a hooked up to the routher with an ethernet cable, and computer b is wireless. 
they both got internet connection just fine.. i ran the create small home network wizard on both computers just as the instructions tell me...(the ones in weekend project) the problem is that in computer b when i go to my network places and click on view my workgroup computers i get this message: home( which is my workgroup name) is not accesible. 
you might not have permission to use this network resource. 
contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. the list of servers of this workgroup is currently unavailable. 
also when i try to add my shared printer to computer b i cant find it, it wont even find my workgroup... so when i go to computer a, i click on view workgroup computers, i can see them both there, but..if i try to click on computer b i get this message: you might not have permission to use this network resource. 
contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. 
network path was not found i followed the exact instructions so i dont know wats goin on, maybe cuz is xphome and not xppro... (my printer is connected to computer a, so i dont need to add it, but if i got add printer and look in network i do see my workgroup there, is only in computer b where is not finding my workgroup)
