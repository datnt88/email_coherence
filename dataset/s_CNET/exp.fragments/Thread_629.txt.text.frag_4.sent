i know i have amyn questions. 
i'm new to this mac thing, so i'm trying to learn as much about it as possible. 
it's an hp deskjet f380 all in one. 
printer-scanner-copier. 
it's hooked up to my pc. my parents have a hp office jet 6210 all in one. 
printer-faxer-copier-scanner. 
and yes i do have a few problems. 
i'm trying to learn all i can about macs, as i like to learn new things. 
i understand alot of it from reading things on the internet already. 
i just ask about what i don't really understand. 
thanks
