a few weeks ago, while using my beloved desktop, it crashed to &quot;blue screen error&quot;.

and really shaken-up, i tried a norton recovery diskette (which went and wrote a windows millenium &quot;boot block&quot; onto my hard drive, by way of &quot;system recovery&quot;). 
then i tried to boot my system: windows reported an &quot;invalid disk array&quot;. 
then with my heart in my mouth ( 'cos things seemed to have gotten worse) i learnt from the internet that norton (system) recovery diskettes are made to recover win9x and winme systems -- ouch! so, what could cause windows to suddenly change its mind about a set of seagate barracuda disk running off a highpoint hpt370a raid controller (processor), in raid 0 configuration ? 
or, more accurately, what is an &quot;inaccessible boot device&quot;? 
my norton anti-virus guard had the latest virus definitions and was operational. 
and one day or so before, i had done a full system virus check which found no viruses. 
i also have a fully working firewall, which also was operational. 
and, and i had my windows service packs installed and up-to-date. the resulting situation: a) my desktop could no longer boot-up through to the windows desktop. 
b) bios could &quot;see&quot; my hard drive and the highpoint raid controller raid 0). c) bios could boot my system up to: &quot;invalid disk&quot; &quot;please insert disk and press any key&quot; d) the &quot;posting&quot; process for bios boot-up allows boot-up from: i) floppy, on drive a: ii) cd, on drive d: i then attempted windows recovery from the windows cd-rom. the result of this was: i) windows setup kept needing to be supplied with the driver for the highpoint raid controller. 
ii) windows setup could not do an &quot;emergency&quot; system repair -- it needs a previously prepared &quot;emergency diskette&quot; to be able to do that. 
and i never knew about this. 
i never made one. 
iii) windows setup said that it couldn't find the &quot;existing windows operating system&quot; iiii) windows setup said that it was unable to format my hard drives (which have one large partition (38mb) and one small partition (4mb). 
[i never new that my drives were set up this way. 
my desktop was factory assembled. 
i bought it complete. 
that company went bust this january gone!) really, i wanted to recover three years worth of my work which i had on my hard drive (and i still want to). 
when i consulted one of the tech support guys over at a microsoft technical support center (70 per hour), the guy there said to me: &quot;there is no way that the work and information on the hard drive can be saved (recovered)&quot; he then strongly advised that i &quot;reformatted&quot; my drives for the purpose of doing a &quot;fresh install of windows&quot;. 
i asked him again if there was another way to recover my system so that i would not loose my precious work. 
he repeated: &quot;no.there 
isn't.&quot; as i am new to the innards of a computer -- and frankly, i was panic striken -- i went with his advice. 
the formatting process proceeded for some minutes (and, it formatted over 80% of drive c), then windows 2000 professional setup program stopped and reported that: &quot;setup was unable to format drive c. the hard disk may be damaged. 
make sure the disk is on and properly connected to your computer. 
if the disk is a scsi disk, make sure your scsi devices are properly terminated. 
see your computer or scsi adapter documentation for more information. 
setup cannot continue. 
to quit setup, press f3.&quot; v) windows setup said that it was unable to (do anything) and i quit it. 
another questions: did the format process wipe any of my data? 
it aborted before completing whatever it was doing. 
can i rescue my data? 
b. i then tried the windows console tool: i) windows console's chkdsk /r reported that: &quot;... unrecoverable errors&quot; well, what does that mean? 
while you are all scratching your heads, here is the current state of play: ........................................................................................................................................ 1. i contacted highpoint and asked for a bootable diagnostic software tool. 
i got this, used it and sent the results back to highpoint technologies. 
this is their reply: &quot;dear sir/madam, testing udma 5 on st320414a: fail --- the hard disks can't work with ata100 normally. the verification is ok---it means that the hard disks doesn't have bad sectors. 
&quot;invalid partition table. 
setup cannot continue .. error loading operating system. 
setup cannot continue... &quot; you can ignore the above information. 
each logical hard disk will have this information. 
all zeros from word address [000] through to word address [1f0] as you create raid0 with the hard disk. 
and this hard disk is the second member of the raid0. 
so you can't see the &quot;invalid partition table. 
setup cannot continue&quot; we think your hard disks can't work normally. 
you had better not plug them into the hpt370 controller and create raid with them. 
regards, highpoint technologies inc.&quot; now, i nowadays find that i have to ask this question: &quot;do these guys know what they are talking about?&quot; and: &quot;what does it mean -- what they have said. 
what does it mean?&quot; anybody know? 
and 2. take a look at this from seagate technologies: &quot;mr (xxxxxxxx), the reason seatools is not seeing the drives is because of the highpoint raid controller. 
seatools can not test the drives on a raid controller other than the generic mode. 
i would suggest running a windows 2000 repair. 
what are the results. 
best regards, stefan m. seagate technical support&quot; okay guys, what's he saying? 
just so you guys know: only one of the software tools on the seatools software package failed. 
six other software tools worked. 
and they correctly identified the hpt370a controller, and the two hard disks. 
i need and want to restore my system to full workability, just as fast as possible. 
with my data recovered and a raid hard drive setup -- i want the speed of raid. 
any ideas -- anybody? 
good, workable advice and instruction will be especially welcome.
