hi i was wondering if my printer will work if i switched to 64 bit computing. 
i am talking about the office. 
we have a few printers and the 4-5 pcs can access them as necessary. 
right now we work with 32 bit computers. 
if we were to switch, what would i have to do to make the printers work? 
intels processors are said to work seamlessly with 64 and 32 tasks. 
now does that mean that i can install windows xp or vista 64 bit editions on my computers while utilizing 32 bit printer drivers? 
if this does not work then can i get a print server and connect multiple printers and computers and make 64 bit computers work with the printers? 
i will have to check out if 64 bit drivers are available or not. 
my questions are for the time when there are no printer drivers available. 
thank you
