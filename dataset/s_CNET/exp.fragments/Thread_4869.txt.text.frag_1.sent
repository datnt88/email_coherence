hello, i am building a system and i am not sure what motherboard to buy. 
i am thinking about getting an intel motherboard core i7. 
i am not sure which motherboard to go for. 
to give you a better idea. 
i don't play games. 
i need a computer for music production. 
here are a few that i have been looking at evga ( item=n82e16813188049) any others you might recommend? 
should i go amd route? 
realistically, i don't want to spend over $200 if possible, but if people are for the evga then i might just do it. 
thank you very much for your time
