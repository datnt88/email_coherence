hello. 
i have an nvidia geforce 7600gs video card connected via pcie. 
i am running a 32 bit vista home premium os. the card is a pny manufactured card. 
anyways, when playing games such as call of duty 4, the card overheats after a few hours. 
i can tell when colored artifacts appear on the screen and the pc crashes. 
i installed the nvidia ntune utility in hopes of increasing the fan speed to prevent the overheating. 
the ntune utility cannot do this. 
i installed 3 different versions of rivatuner and there is no fan tab when i go to change the settings. 
i read someone that disabling driver signing can fix this but that is only for 64 bit vista and i am running 32 bit vista. 
i also installed atitool and it cannot change the fan setting since it thinks the card isnt in use by the os. i am at a loss. 
i have already bought a new 450w $100 power supply because pny said it was a power issue. 
i am experienced with pcs and have a good knowledge about all this but i cant seem to get any tool to change the fan setting. 
im not the only one with this issue but really need a viable solution. 
i do know for a fact that the card itself supports fan speed adjustments. 
any help is appreciated. 
thanks.
