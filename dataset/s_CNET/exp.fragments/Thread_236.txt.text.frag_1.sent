as one of many being totally confused as to which tablet to buy, after all the usual attempts to eliminate potential &quot;bombs&quot;, the one question i have been unable to have answered, properly is when looking at machines available how do you know if it will have an up-grade from ics to jb. what has further confused me is just one hour ago reading a punter,s review of a samsung machine with ics and he was able to up-grade to jb himself using kies. 
so, before buying a particular machine which only carries ics, how can you tell if an up-grade is possible?
