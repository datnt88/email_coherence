emachines t3092 athlon 3000+ 2.17ghz 2g ram, windows xp just had put in e-geforce 7600 gs agp graphics card, says on the box it requires 400w psu. 
so upgraded my 300w to a 450w. 
was getting error message on boot saying that not enough power was going to the graphics card so it was lowering performance so as not to damage hardware. 
so i got a 600w psu put in there, and still the same thing is happening. 
why? 
and what do i try next?
