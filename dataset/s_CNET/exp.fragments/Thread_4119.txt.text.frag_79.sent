i own a small computer store in which i build, sell, upgrade and repair computers. 
i have installed many sapphire cards in the computers that i have sold in the last 4 years and have had only one that i had to replace for a customer. 
i am currently running 2 sapphire hd 4870 cards crossfirex in one of the computers that i game on and also have them moderately overclocked and for the last 18 months they have given me great service with no sign of failing. 
i am using stock cooling on these cards. 
under load, playing crysis at the highest settings, the temps have never gotten over mid 60c. 
sound like just the bad luck of getting 3 defective ones. 
oh, and the type of case that they are in and the cooling characteristics of the case will have a bearing on the heat generated.
