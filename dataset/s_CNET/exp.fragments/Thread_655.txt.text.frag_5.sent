although it could be hardware like the motherboard or network card, you would like to rule out the software, there is one thing you mentioned; it only happends when you connect to internet, so check that you have installed the latest service pack and the latest recurity patches that fix windows vulnerability. 
look for any bios update for your motherboard. 
if the network card is not onboard try it in different slots, and removed any other one. 
if that still doesn't, verify that it only happend when your use the internet if so then replace the network card or if it is onboard, then you can buy the card and disable the onboard on the bios settings. 
hope it could have give you some ideas.
