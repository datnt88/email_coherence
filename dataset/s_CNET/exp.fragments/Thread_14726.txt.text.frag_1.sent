hi there! 
i'm not a newbie by all means, however i'm curious if anyone has any constructive advice? 
a friend of mine has a p4 mdg-built, intel motherboard pc which now cannot power on. 
it was in this condition at my arrival at the scene of the crime. 
an inexeperienced individual has been fiddling around with the corrections, and after finishing, the computer allegedly never powered on afterwards. 
i reconnected all of the loose and missing cables to their correct places, and tested the power supply (using a paperclip to connect green to black wires on the power supply's 24-pin connector). 
when i plug the 24-pin connector back into the motherboard, the led on the motherboard and the front of the computer lights up. 
however when i attempt to power the computer up, nothing happens. 
anyone have any ideas? 
i'm out... either the mobo is busted and needs to be replaced/fixed, or i missed some connectors? 
could it be that the power supply is only half-busted? 
it could be that the button is not plugged into the right spot (doubtful), but i've tried manually connecting the two pins with a knife, etc. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the long message. 
tia
