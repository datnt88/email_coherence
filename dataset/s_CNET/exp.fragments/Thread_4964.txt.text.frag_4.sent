i got it going. 
in my bios it was booting from hd1 instead of hd0. 
once i figured that out all went perfectly. 
i did try using the utility that came with the hd but for some reason my a drive only reads some of the disk but not all. 
it would not read this one. 
it says the disk needed to be reformatted. 
i have bunches of floppies with pictures on them but when i went from 98 to xp i have not been able to view them. 
i even changed the a dive thinking it was bad but i get the same thing. 
but that is another story. 
i did get it wiped clean and reformatted. 
i have been moving my stuff to it already and all seems to be working well. 
thanks for the help.
