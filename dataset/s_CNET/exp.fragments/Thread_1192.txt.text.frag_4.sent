i did get the laptop reconnected to the internet. 
however, i took the old drivers for the printer off and reloaded them from the website. 
i then restarted the computer. 
the printer will not allow me to share even though everthing is checked to share. 
i did not take the firewalls down when i did this. 
i even tried to back door by searching for the host computer but it did not locate it.
