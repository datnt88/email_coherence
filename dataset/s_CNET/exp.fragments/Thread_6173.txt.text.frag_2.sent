it should be located on the motherboard. 
ususally at the front side of the case, at or near the bottom of the board. 
mine has a double row of small pins for various things to plug in. the power switch, hdd led, case speaker, etc. it should be printed on the board &quot;pwr&quot; or something similar. 
if you have the manual that came with the computer, there should be a diagram of the motherboard with this information in it. 
good luck.
