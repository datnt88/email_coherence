i am running a wireless router and am wondering if i can also use a wireless keyboard and mouse. 
will i run into frequency problems if i have to many wireless items on my computers? 
does anyone know if this is a problem? 
i would like to add a wireless keyboard and mouse to both computers in the house, but am not sure if this is even possible with the wireless router.
