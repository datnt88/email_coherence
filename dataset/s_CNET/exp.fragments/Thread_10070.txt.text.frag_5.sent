i had a motherboard that did the same thing only to memory chips. 
i replaced the psu and things were fine for a while and then i started getting hard drive errors. 
after checking the motherboard i found several capacitors with bulging tops which meant they were bad. 
don't know if there was a connection between the bad psu and the capacitors.
