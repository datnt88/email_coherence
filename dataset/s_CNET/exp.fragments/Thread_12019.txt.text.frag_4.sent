thank you for your help. 
why i'm thinking of android system at all is that the windows slates are very expensive. 
i bought the hp 500 sometimes in 2011 but in less than 4 months the sliding power switch failed, locking up the system (you neither switch on or off) and is in for warrant repair or replacement. 
meanwhile i needed a slate so i currently have the samsung series 7 which most agree is very expensive.
