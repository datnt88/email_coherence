gtwilson, the guy who originally created this thread and posted this problem hasn't logged on since last year, look at the date his post was created on, it was last year, so i doubt we will receive any kind of reply from him on how he finally fixed this problem. 
it seems like it has to do with the way the system is partioned and everything, i bet if you completely formatted the computer, the recovery partion and everything else and installed windows xp pro it would recognize the correct memory amount. 
i might have to try this as a last resort if nobody else has a better idea.
