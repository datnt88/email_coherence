i would suggest that you set up and configure a router that allows you to do what's called &quot;captured portal&quot; what this does is that anyone who gains access to your wifi signal will be instantly routed to a website. 
you will have to write this website, but it's simple to do... you can have the website say &quot;if you need to have access to this *free* wifi, please get the password from an employee of xyz store&quot; then you change that every week. 
have a whiteboard in the back room that has that week's password and viola! 
you're good to go! and the great thing here is that all of this is free... grab an old computer, download monowall to a cd, boot the computer off the cd and configure monowall...boom, done! 
this is what i use at home and it's bulletproof!
