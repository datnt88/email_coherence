that using fat in any version is death to such a project. 
no matter what you do you should see failure after failure. 
even on a clean shutdown it can still fail. 
i had to let a customer learn this over a full year before they gave up and changed to ntfs. 
that's not damage proof but at least it's journaled and damage resistant. 
why not fix the basic issue first?
