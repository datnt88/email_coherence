as robert stated, &quot;bad caps&quot; can be a fault. 
google for images to verify yours. 
its a known problem. 
next, while the psu was tested, i believe it was simple voltage &quot;leds&quot; on small tester rather than a full-blown power test. 
some psus can appear ok on the little tester but fail as when a real power demand is required not just the presence as the &quot;pumff&quot; to get things going isn't there. 
they too suffer from bad caps as well as caps are everywhere in electronics. 
if your system case isn't well cooled, a psu can falter over time on that alone. 
switches are tricky, they can work and not if of cheap make-up or faulty, period. 
though, switches are rarely a cause of problems, simple as they, only an ohm meter can verify that.
