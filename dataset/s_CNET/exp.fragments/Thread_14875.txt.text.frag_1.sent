my disc drive has dissapeared. 
i can boot up and it's still there, and it's still listed under device manager, but programs don't recognize it and it's not listed in my computer. 
i'm running xp pro 64 bit and i tried to download tweakui because i saw that as a solution for someone with a similar problem in these forums but i can't find a compatible version for my windows. 
any help would be greatly appreciated.
