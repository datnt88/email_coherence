hello ibrahim, thank you for the advice. 
i think the speaker and cable have no problems because the same speaker i use for my laptop. 
i have been trying to find out a solution by googling too but i found a lot of similar problems but their solution is not fix the problem. 
just i sent a mail to realtek to get some help. 
i do not know now whether it is a hardware problem or driver problem. 
watching movie is somewhat ok but the music, i cannot enjoy it, its very disturbing. 
regards, wildbird
