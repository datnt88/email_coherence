hi... i have used generic ink cartridges for a long time for my hp psc 950 *printer*fax*scanner*copier*... however, i don't think this problem i'm asking for advice on has to do w/ the cartridge: this time when the black ink ran out, i never got the message on the little screen &quot;low ink&quot; replace ink soon or whatever, my copies just got so faint that i replaced the cartridge. 
now, the message on my little screen says, &quot;press enter to align cartridges&quot; and, when i do so, it begins and the screen reads: &quot;printing align cartridge page&quot; then it goes about it's business for a minute then says, &quot;alignment failed, please try again&quot; and i can't get past this... over and over. 
i take the cartridge out, i replace the cartridge, i even got a new cartridge and, even tho i'm only replacing the black, i take the color out too and reinsert it: nothing... and no option to just clear the error and use the machine as is... i can't even send faxes out which requires no ink at all... any advice? 
thanks
