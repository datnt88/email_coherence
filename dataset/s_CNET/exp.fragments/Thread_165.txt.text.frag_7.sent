the largest hard drive that it will support is 160gb which only comes in 5400rpm and the fastest is an 80gb that runs at 7200. the computer is a dell inspiron 6000 with win xp and yes it is running but needs considerable work (like reformatting, etc) so i will be putting in a retail windows xp that i already have and a hard drive for just under $100 and 2 ram cards at one gb apiece at $45 for each. 
there won't be a lot that has to be backed up and what there is will be backed up onto a 32gb thumbdrive and then downloaded to my main desktop computer. 
as i stated this computer will have limited use. 
i have two other desktops that i use except for when i am traveling. 
the only thing that i will be backing up is my quicken stuff, my excel spreadsheet, word documents, and jpeg images.
