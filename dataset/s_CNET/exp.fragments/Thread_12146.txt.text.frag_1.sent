hi, i have a wireless network setup in my house. 
4 computers are wireless and 3 are wired. 
i have my router setup in my office, where two of the wired pcs are and one of the wireless pcs. 
i've had a few issues since getting it, where i would lose a connection on one of my wireless computers, but it was infrequent and just didn't both me much with how often it happened... i think these were just normal issues and nothing to be concerned about. 
i've noticed lately that i tend to lose my connection a lot more now. 
i have two cordless phones that i've set to different frequencies (or channels) and they don't really seem to interfere. 
however, i'm finding that the microwave is now causing me issues and will disconnect me. 
this is a little diagram of how i have it setup up. 
r= router ddd= door m= microwave [r---------------ddd-----------------desk with laptop [ [ wall====== [ [ [kitchen [ [m the kitchen and office both exit into the same hallway, that then leads to the room where my computer is with the problems. the microwave actually would be behind me, where the router is pretty much straight to my left. is there anything that can be done to prevent my laptop from losing connection when the microwave on, or is this an issue that cannot be corrected? 
thanks so much!
