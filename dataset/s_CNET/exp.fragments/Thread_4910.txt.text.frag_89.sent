i have been on the newest bios since about 3 days after it was released and i haven't had any restarts (knocking on wood until my knuckles are bleeding). 
i have run the pc through hell and back trying to get it to restart. 
i ran crysis (pc game that is known to be hard on pc's), media center for 3 straight days and running orb server without any problems. 
i was never able to do that prior to the january bios update. 
i read that there is another bios release. 
i am a little apprehensive on installing it because this bios has been pretty good so far. 
good luck to everyone!
