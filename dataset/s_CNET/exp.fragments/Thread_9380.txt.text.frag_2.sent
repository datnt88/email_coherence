you have pc133 ram, are you sure of that fact that you got the same. 
if not, it won't work! all you have to do is put the ram into the slot and start the computer up, where the backsreen will show that its checking ram and it should show the new amount, if not go into your system and perfomance and it'll show your current ram installed and it should read the amount. 
if not, then you must've done something wrong, or wrong ram that is not supported.
