i searched and couldn't find this one specifically. 
i know that there was a limit on the size of hard drive the mac would recognize - can't remember all the specifics but it was related perhaps to version of the firewire bridge used (???). i put a 200 gb drive into an older maxtor firewire enclosure as the original hard failed. 
i ran into the limit factor as my mac (g4 mdd 1.25 ghz) only 'sees' 128 gb. at the time i didn't care as the drive i was replacing was a 60 gb drive. 
i assume it's because of the older firewire bridge (?) in the enclosure if that's the right terminology. 
my question is can this be undone - the full 200 gb being seen - by putting the drive in a newer enclosure with a more current firewire bridge? 
for the heck of it i tried putting the drive into a newer (relative to the old maxtor enclosure) usb enclosure and the 128 gb limit remained. 
i do have a 500 gb in an owc fw enclosure that is 'seen' correctly. 
thanks for any help anyone may be able to offer.
