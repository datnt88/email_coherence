perhaps a little more detail would help. 
my windows xp computer and my windows me computer share files effectively. 
neither can access files on the windows 2000 computer although that computer does appear on the network. 
the xp computer displays a message that says: the windows 2000 desktop is not accessible. 
you might not have permission to use this network resource. 
contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permission. the network path was not found.&quot; the windows me computer displays a similar message. 
however, the windows 2000 computer can read shared files from the other two computers and displays all its own shared folders under my network places/ entire network/ microsoft windows network where the shared folders from the other computers are also displayed. 
any help would be much appreciated.
