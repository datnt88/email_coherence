likely assist you much cheaper than you could hope from me. 
going along with ray's military analogy, another cost factor is the limited production of military specific components--thus a $20.00 bolt for an abrams tank. 
if they have what you want &quot;in stock&quot; it is as little as $25. if they don't it can be more.
