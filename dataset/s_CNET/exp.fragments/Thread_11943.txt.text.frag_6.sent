i see there are 2 versions. 
i will only check the b1 version. 
if you have the a1 version i will wait a few days before i comment again. 
please folk, supply the details if you want the best help. 
this model does not appear to have the firewall that blocks windows sharing. 
as such it appears you have something else going on. 
i'll wait for you to share what web site you are using to setup your networking shares.
