i've had experience with similar symptoms such as the ones you have described both personally and professionally. 
from what i can tell is that 80% of the time, degredation in performance from what was originally working flawlessly turned out to be something so simple and basic! 
defrag and scandisk. 
then use msconfig to shave off the excess bloatware loading at startup as well as non-microsoft services. 
speaking from experience working in tech support for a major video game company, video cards usually display symptoms of eminent failure with graphical corruption or no function at all. 
i'll have to also agree with my peers regarding physical check up and diagnostics on the card itself. 
finally, there's always the option to contact the card manufacturer's customer support.
