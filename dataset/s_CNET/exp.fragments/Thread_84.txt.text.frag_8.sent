ok i have figured out the formatting and partitioning issues...(thx for the help) but no matter what i do and i chose large disk support and everything as instructed but it still is only showing as it's an 8 gig hard ddrive instead of 80, im at wits end and dont know what to do to get it to use all of my disk space
