the dual-core athlon 64 as displayed was on a socket 939 board. 
if you are looking at 64-bit, you are classed as a high end user. 
you'll find that video editing, games and more on windows 2000/xp/linux/other oses will perform better on dual cpus. 
putting two cpus in one socket is cheaper than dual cpu boards.
