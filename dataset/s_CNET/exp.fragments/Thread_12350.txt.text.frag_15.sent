i had several systems that i had been rolling all of my data forward for years. 
this included documents, emails and pictures. 
my last system had a 250gb drive and a cloned 250gb stored in the case, but no power applied. 
i would hook it up when i was ready to clone the current system again. 
it came in handy several times as a bootable drive. 
then, hurricane katrina hit new orleans. 
i figured i would be back home in 72 hours. 
when the 17th st canal levee broke, i had just under 7 feet of water in my house. 
do you care to guess where my backup hard drive was? 
yep, still in the computer at home. 
i lost 11 years of stuff. 
next time, i will take my backup with me. 
before, i was foolish. 
now, i am experienced!
