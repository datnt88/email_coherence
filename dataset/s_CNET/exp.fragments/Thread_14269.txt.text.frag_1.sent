i'm using a fairly new built pc at work running w2k, asus mobo w/fan and amd xp 2800 processor, allied 400w ps w/two fans. the cpu is around 2 ghz i think and ram is 512. 
according to a third party app the cpu temp is 58c - 60c and that seems too high to me. 
others here seem to think because it's an amd processor that the temp is normal. 
is it normal? 
or should i worry about it being too high? 
i'm used to cpu temps in the 30s.
