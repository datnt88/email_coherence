do you mean from device to bridge, or just connecting a computer to the device using a crossover cable? 
with the first bridge (motorola we800g), i got it second hand and there was no cable with it, i've mostly been using a standard patch cable, but tried once or twice with a crossover cable (but have not tested this extensively). 
with the second bridge (netgear wge101), i've been using the cable provided with it. 
if you mean connecting a computer to the device with a crossover cable: that's what i have been doing to transfer stuff to / from it (and works fine), but for convenience i would like to simply have it on the wireless network.
