andrew i can empathize with your situation having owned an isp long ago and i had similar issues i suggest a very quick look at some smarter routers , even the wrt-dd &quot;hacked&quot; types to facilitate 802.1p quality of service bandwidth throttling and instead of allowing a full 8000k per second , how about a nice pinch down to 1024k for all types of allowing sntp and pop3 and the basics 512k (in both directions)? 
pinch that pipe or ask your service provider if they could limit the traffic; the problem is that it takes special &quot;appliances&quot; to do this stuff and its costly for a biz owner that must deal with drunks and waitress-shrinkage at the till and probably other things dont worry about &quot;slower pipe&quot; syndrome you are paying for the access and providing a free? 
service you can also configure wrt-dd router types for special pay-to-access support although its unclear in the forums on the logistics of this service and brings up the quality of service issues in reverse. 
password of the day suggestions provide an extra barrier but your staff now have to deal with announcing that // it may provide some control but wont limit your per-packet cost john (37 years telecom, 9 years in ispaccess)
