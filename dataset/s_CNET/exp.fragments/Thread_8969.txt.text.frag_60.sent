we're talking 20+ in the past 2 years. 
aside from all of the computers that i maintain, i have reformatted my own system about 5 times in the last 2 years. 
why? because it's a lot easier than hunting for viruses. 
it's not that i can't or don't know how to resolve these issues, it's simply that i just don't care to try. 
i build custom computer systems. 
i have a dual core amd opteron @2.84ghz, 2 gigs ram 2-3-2-5, 3 hard drives (10,000rpm), liquid cooling, etc. i use acronis true image enterprise edition. 
after i had everything set up one time. 
i made an image of my hard drive, 1.94gb after compressed, that i keep on one of my other hard drives. 
i can format, install windows and all of my drivers and programs in under 2 minutes. 
all i have to do is store my crap on one hard drive and my os on another. 
with that type of time frame, why would i ever look for issues? 
average computer systems can restore an image from a dvd in about 20 minutes. 
i am also in the early stages of designing sourcedesktop.com. 
i built that computer and run it as a secondary.
