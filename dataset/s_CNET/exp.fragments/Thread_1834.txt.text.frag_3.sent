since, you didn't mention diddy about your system it hard to fathom what you're up against. 
let me point out, if you push it too hard, expect problems, throttle back until you reach a happy medium were all componets and such work at a &quot;stable rate&quot;. 
best, to check pc modders websites for tips/hints, etc. on the topic. 
my only warning, *make darn sure the system is well cooled and power supply can handle demands*.
