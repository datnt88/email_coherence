another hard disk in an usb enclosure is now under 99 bucks. 
this could be what you clone your one and only copy to. 
then operate on the clone. 
-&gt; maybe i was unclear that more hardware may be needed but you are taking a wreckless approach to recovery without this copy and clone method. 
test disk may or may not work. 
it may make it worse. 
sorry if i was unclear here.
