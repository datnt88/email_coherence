i would really appreciated your help..here is my specs: i have a wd passport usb portable hard drive:120gb and my laptop is a dell inspiron e1705 (9400): harddrive: 100gb, serial ata, ram 1gb ram memory: 512 mb processor: intel core duo 1.73hz windows xp and the problem is: i bought the wd on january and it has been working fine (exc. 
for the occasional error: &quot;it can not be remove now, try later.&quot; 
i just waited a couple of seconds and remove it without problem). 
but today i was trying to cut/paste some files from my laptop to the wd. i pasted the 1ts one, but after that it gave an error saying: &quot;cannot copy (put filename here) : the drive cannot find the sector requested&quot; i unplugged the wd and plug it in again... and happened the same, copy one file and then the error.... even thus this is happening i`m able to read all my files on the wd (all types: pics, clips...) and i was able to copy/paste files from the wd&gt;&gt; laptop.. after doing this several times (3-4times)i was finally able to cut/paste all the files (no one by one, but as is suppose to be done) without getting this error again. 
so even thus the problem seem fix now (without me doing anything) i would like to known what to expect, meaning: why did this happen? 
should i check something that may be working wrong? 
or any advice that you would consider helpfull. 
thank you ...
