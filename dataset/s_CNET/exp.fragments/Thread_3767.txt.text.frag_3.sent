any paper that doesn't cycle through the printer and remains in the paper path, is a jam. 
what i believe has happened, are that your paper &quot;feed rollers&quot; simply are worn down/out. 
they need to be cleaned more often and/or replaced. 
the best cleaner is a product the &quot;rejuvenates the rubber&quot; grip wheels and truly cleans them. 
you can find that cleaner is any decent office or computer outlet or online. 
beware, that the rubber rejuvenater is very caustic to plastic and easily dissolves it, so handle with care and use a clean cloth with solution. 
otherwise, the cost of grip wheel replacement or repair itself is the same or more than a new printer.
