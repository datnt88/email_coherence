bob i guess more information is needed, tried a wired connection, originally i had my cable modem/wireless on the main floor next to by blue ray player. 
purchased a 50ft cat5e cable so my son can play xbox in the basement...it did not work, i moved the modem down to the basement plugged in a shorter cable and the xbox worked, so it had to be the cable, if i do that again with the blue ray player i am afraid the same thing will happen even though i know 50ft is well within the specifications of cat5e. 
plus i don't really want to run a cable that long (kind of a pain) if you know what i mean
