i have a wireless modem/router downstairs and will be putting a desktop pc upstairs. 
i was wondering what would be better: a wireless access point or a wireless desktop card. 
i do have one free pci expansion slot for the card. 
however, i was wondering if one was better than the other when it comes to speed, coverage (distance from router), etc. anyone have any thoughts? 
thanks!
