i kinda had the same problem with my sony vaio vgn s150 (still got it). when i brought it, the built in wireless worked great on my wireless network at home, i wanted to go with windows pro so i just reinstalled and what do you know the wireless stopped working. 
even with me downloading all the drivers i could off of the sony site, nothing would work. 
i reinstalled windows three times on it before i just gave up and kept it. 
one thing that did help a little when the wireless wasn't working was to install sp2. 
that helped my laptop see the router but for some reason still couldn't connect. 
so i just went the way i knew would work, so i just brought me a wireless network adapter and it's been great ever since. 
for some reason windows just wouldn't handle my wireless correctly anymore after that reinstall. 
after all of that, it sounds like you just brought it so yeah like bob said warranty.
