thanks to all of you, and also my monitor is a viewsonic va930m [19&quot; lcd] screen, oh and uh maybe i sound a little stupid but, im not sure if system ram is what i've been adding or not. 
see originally the computer came with 512 mgb's, but i added in two more 256mb memory cards, and since i see no other slots im guessing that its the system ram, but i had no idea memory cards costed so much, i can get them cheap for 10 bucks a gig. 
and i'm possibly getting 3 one gigabyte cards so maybe if i can get that my system will run better. 
also i've downloaded directx 11.0 to my system so i'm thinking it should make a difference. 
and to vapcmd : if i add the memory, will it automatically upgrade the amount of memory used for video? 
another problem, maybe the reason i can't run daz 3d on my pc is because i'm missing the multimedia controller and the multimedia video controller, but i can't find out where to download them free
