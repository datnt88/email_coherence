hi thanks for the reply. 
at the time of the crash i was using nero express that came with the first cdrw i had on the computer. 
i was just updating it from time to time. 
i was thinking the same thing about nero. 
so i uninstalled and bought the whole package, nero burn. 
no changes, it still crashes... boy-o-boy... swan
