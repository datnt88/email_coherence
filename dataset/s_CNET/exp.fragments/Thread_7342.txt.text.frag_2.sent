you can look up dban but first be sure you have the restore media and that it works. 
after you dban it, restore it and it's ready. 
sadly i see these go for 99 bucks all the time on ebay. 
you may want to consider just offering it without all the work on the hard drive (just dban it) and then put it out to freecycle.
