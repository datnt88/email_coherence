most tablets are never repaired for reasons such as no spare parts, no service manual and of course the old b.e.r. issue. 
what is ber? for example this tablet seems to go for under 90 bucks and a service counter here is over 100. 
it does not make sense to fix such a thing but to replace it. 
you bring up a good point such as should products be offered that are not going to be repaired?
