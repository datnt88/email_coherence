thx kees & ahtoi, i have two wireless laptops. 
both support hdmi,s-video/rga. 
i bought at the suggestion of a sales rep @ comp usa a dsm-510(d-link) however, he must have misunderstood me, from what gather this type dsm is for games,video,photo's only. 
of course, i opebed it and is non-returnable. 
no use for it now!!!! at&t offers u-verse enabling one to record tv shows,etc, but it's not available here. 
that would work for me. 
i could get rid of the dish. the dish has many useless channels(i'm on lower end package) and shows the same shows over and over. 
ahtoi, i'll check your wireless suggestions, that's what i need. 
i found one for $295.00 called &quot;internetvue 2100&quot; by add logix, but out of my budget at this time, maybe later. 
does anyone have any knowledge of msn tv? thx for the f/u ressponse guys. 
much appreciated.
