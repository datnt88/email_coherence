rough lesson indeed! 
however, i am not really a fanatic with my defragging. 
i run it about once every week or two, and i do it that frequently as i do move quite a few files around. 
i had recently experienced some mystery reboots, and had hoped that straightening things out with a boot defrag might help. 
silly me! that aside, however...any ideas...? a friend suggested a cd disk lens cleaner. 
however i'm not sure how i might activate this when i can only boot into dos mode via cd boot disk. 
i am re-running scandisk, and it seems to be accessing the drive without difficulty, noting a few of the bad sectors as it always has. 
so i doubt this is the problem. 
appreciate any steps folks might recommend.
