thank you for the link to the seagate customer support form. 
hopefully, they will respond with the software or a workaround. 
you are right that they should at least have put a warning on the installation instructions to make a backup of the utility software to a cd or flash drive to protect idiots like me from themselves and doing something like this. the easiest and most logical thing would be to have the software available for download on their web site ... almost all companies do this and the software is no good without their hardware so it is a great service that costs them virtually nothing. 
i will let you know how they respond. 
thanks again for the suggestion/link.
