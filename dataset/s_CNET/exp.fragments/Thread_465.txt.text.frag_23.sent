it's a toshiba satellite a200-s01 acquired in january - 2.2ghz c2d, 2gb ddr2-667, 2x160gb drives, hd-rom/dl burner, a/b/g wifi, 512mb hd-2600 mobile video chipset, and thoroughly exorcised of vista - xp sp3 with help from driverpacks.net and nlite. 
battery life is...rather pitiful when compared to the ibook i refurbished - granted the ibook used no more than 45w at full power, the c2d cpu uses that much power itself - but i got it because of it's gaming ability.
