hello, thanks for the feedback. 
i suppose i could have been more specific. 
there was an available slot, but the sound card was too large(?). regardless...i did take it back and bought a usb sound card ( an item that previously i did not know existed). 
a prior response helped me to find it. 
great sound now.
