it runs better with one stick than two. 
have you tried each individual stick to make sure one isn't bad? 
no, just because it's new doesn't mean it's good. 
are you sure you handled them with care, or that you were properly grounded when you installed the ram, or touched other components? 
did you make sure the ram slots are clean of dirt and dust and the ram connectors are clean as well? 
are you sure it isn't the graphics card? 
you said it was running sluggish before. 
while 512 isn't top end, i have't seen too many computers run that sluggish on 512 unless it had other issues.are 
you sure your cpu fanheat sink are clear of dust and dirt as well? 
i may not have caught what power supply you have, what wattage is it?
