&quot;i have a worry that most branded work stations are for rather &quot;general&quot; purposes&quot; if it is that special purpose then why would we consider a general purpose computer? 
sorry but let me introduce myself. 
i'm one of those folk that designs embedded computers and other solutions. the reason we use general purpose computers on intel and such cpus is they deliver a big bang for the buck. 
these are not considered &quot;specific purpose&quot; like a recent design had with a rack of dsp (digital signal processing) cpus. 
i'd reconsider a nice ready to use intel i7 machine.
