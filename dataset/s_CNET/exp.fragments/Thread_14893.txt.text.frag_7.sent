that wouldn't be a problem. 
i've had to install various versions of oss on differnet computers. 
windows 95, xp, and 7. (skipped vista cuz it sucks.) i don't plan to use windows 8 because of the layout. 
it's a tablet os in my eyes. 
plus it's a high school assignment so practicalities are largely overlooked...
