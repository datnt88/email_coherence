the &quot;3yr. 
warranty&quot; is just another product they sell. 
you have a problem, they should address it and since monitor is relatively new, go for the replacement. 
understand, you may not get a brand new monitor(you could) but one certified for use as &quot;refurb/rebuild/tested&quot; but will be fine for use. 
anyways, also you may want to get a &quot;monitor test pgm&quot; or similar o disaply test patterns to get tests done. 
your video driver pgm. 
if ati or nvidea should also do some testing. the dx9 or dx10 can have similar test, type at run [dxdiag] no brackets, press enter check into all that, what are your results, act accordingly.
