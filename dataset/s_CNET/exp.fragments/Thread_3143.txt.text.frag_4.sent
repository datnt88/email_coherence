as supplied most usb drives are in fat32 format so it works all over. 
but that's not very damage resistant and pulling the usb cable without asking the os to eject or stop the drive is asking for trouble. 
what next? 
try recovery tools like these: getdataback zero assumption recovery good luck with that.
