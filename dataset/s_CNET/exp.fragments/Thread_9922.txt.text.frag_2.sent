i know those that promote or love it will disagree but due to built-in limitations on playing of certain content, which changed a while ago with widi 2.1. 
so that left all those early adopters with broke systems. 
the result of all this is low sales and low interest over all. 
to solve the hd wireless connection i use one of those wireless hdmi solutions. 
good luck on your search.
