covers all if not most of the steps. 
but let me write about the risk factor. 
as the designer and builder of the new pc, you are buying in that any goof on your part or even a dead component supplied to you is your problem to find and deal with. 
some can't imagine why they have to buy a new motherboard if their homebuilt unit motherboard fails. 
but this is the risk you are accepting. 
in closing, be sure that money is not why you are doing this. 
new, complete over 2ghz p4 boxes are ready to use at 399 dollars. 
you may not be able to beat that price.
