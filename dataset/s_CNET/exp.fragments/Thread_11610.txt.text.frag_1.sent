i really want a lcd monitor to play games watch movies and stuff on my pc. i know lcd's can't compare to regular monitors such as refresh rate and stuff. 
but do you guys know what are one of the best lcd's out there that wont have ghosting while playing games such as counter strike and among other pc games. 
something that almost can match crt monitors.
