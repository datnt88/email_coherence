oh, excellent! 
that looks like a great little device. 
i'll definitely look into it. 
you make a good point about it being hard to achieve perfect color acuity. 
i guess i should add that my main purposes for the monitor will be entertainment related. 
i will be doing graphic work on it as well, but am most concerned about how it will perform as both an hd console gaming tv and high-def pc monitor. 
i'm currently doing pc work on a 5-6 year old old sony sd monitor with vga connectivity only. 
time for a major upgrade.
