put the new drive in as a secondary drive. 
you will get a cd with it that will allow you to copy one drive to another (digital lifeguard tools). 
once that is done, swap the drives out and boot up with the new sata drive. 
make sure everything works! 
be sure you setup the sata as the boot drive in setup first. 
put your old drive into the other hardware and run a recovery disk or fresh install to restore the other xp. this assumes your current working hardware with the 120gb drive supports sata.
