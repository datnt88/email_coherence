erased cd-rw with cdburnerxp. 
put cd-rw in another computer running win xp pro. 
message: no cd in drive. 
put new cd-rw disc (from same box, but never formated as udf) in drive and windows has no problem recognizing it. 
windows xp will not recognize cd-rw with previous udf format. 
am i missing something here?
