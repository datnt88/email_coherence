wendell, you may want to try one drive only and see what happens. 
if this works, try the other drive as the only drive next. 
this will verify that you can format and install your os on either drive with everything else being the same. 
i also recommend using the install program from the os cd. it's never a good idea to use dos to prepare a harddisk drive for use with any version of windows above windows 3.1 as dos does thins a little differently. 
i use power quests partition magic, but this program was designed to be used by power users who know what they are doing. 
ps: i am not sure what you have been told about windows xp that makes you think that it's a bad choice. 
i have been using windows xp sp1 for over one year now and i find it the most user friendly and stable version of windows that microsoft has come out with. 
yeh windows nt (which win2k is one of) may run a little faster and be a little bit more stable, it is also less user friendly and will not let you run as many different software programs as windows xp. if you are moving up from windows me, you might finds that windows 2000 is a little bit more restrictive than you are used to. 
windows xp combines the best of windows nt/2000 with windows me and i have come to love it. 
most problems that i have run into with windows xp are due to running poorly written software that's not compatible with windows xp or due to bad patchs that microsoft has put out. 
by the way, i have found that removing these bad patches is very easy with windows xp and has fixed the problem with out hurting the os. this was always a problems with windows me, 98, and 95. one word of caution though, i have learned that windows xp home ed runs much faster than windows xp pro on the same computer. 
windows xp home runs almost as fast and windows me or 98. the reason for this is that there is less overhead in the home edition than the professional edition (less things going on in the background).
