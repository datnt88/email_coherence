good luck on your choice. 
i like newegg for user reviews, but i recently discovered tigerdirect sometimes have specials that beat newegg's prices. 
and thanks for educating me on the ti4800 thing. 
as to the vivo thing: my ti4200, made by leadtek, has it, and i had zero problems in pvr recording, or recording from another source like a vcr. the only hassle i had was having to run the cabling from cable box to vid card, so i bought a dedicated tv capture card, split the coax cable to my cable modem, and i can record all non premium channels (need the cable box to decode the preium signal). 
waay cool to surf the net while watching tv. and it captures in many different formats. the tv capture card is also made by leadtek and can be found on newegg for around $45. so if you buy both the radeon and leadtek card from newegg, you may get a break on shipping. 
oh, the card has an output also, but i never use that, but nice option. 
if you have probs with the ati drivers, you heard it here! 
good luck on your card choice.
