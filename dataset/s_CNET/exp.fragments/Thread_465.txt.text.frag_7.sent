i bought mine off ubid.com refurbished and got a bigger power supply and a new graphics card. the whole thing cost me about $800 and can play any of today's games on max settings perfectly (except crysis, that's not fair). 
does everything with zero problems, i installed vista ultimate with no slowdown. 
i completely reformat it every 2 months or so to keep it running fast.
