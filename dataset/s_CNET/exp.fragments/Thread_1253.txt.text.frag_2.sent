here's how. 
i have your usual droid running easytether then on a windows xp netbook i use ics then from the ethernet port i connect up a wifi router. 
i must decline any step by step since you must be able to maintain such a setup. the reason i used a netbook is the cost and the power draw on my netbook is less than 10 watts. 
i see some use an old pc but those usually are well above 100 watts.
