look for markings on the board or #s on the video chip that you can run through google. 
you did not mention your os so i suspect it's not xp as it seems to know most ati cards though it sometimes calls the chipset wrong. 
if you don't have xp and have access to an xp machine, you can try to see if that pc can identify it. the risk of this is the &quot;found new hardware&quot; feature that could trigger xp to require reactivation. 
i'd pull the board first and check it. 
a genuine ati board will provide more than a third party offering, however. 
good luck.
