my mouse keeps freezing up. 
i am running xp pro. 
i thought it might be my cordless mouse but i put on the old mouse and it still does the same thing. 
i have to shut my computer down to get it to work. 
it will work for awhile then it does it again. 
if this is not the right forums to ask this question, please direct me to the proper one. 
thanks!
