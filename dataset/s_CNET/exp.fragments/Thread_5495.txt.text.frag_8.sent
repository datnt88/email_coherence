cooling is fine. 
prescott celeron d goes as low as 36c degrees. 
so i'm good now. 
but in order to keep it at that i to have turn all the fans at full blast and its very noisy and not to mention cold. 
but lower watts means less power and less heat. 
and i can put all my fans on low as soon i get the other cpu ands switch. 
won't be as noisy. 
and computer won't need to work so hard to cool.
