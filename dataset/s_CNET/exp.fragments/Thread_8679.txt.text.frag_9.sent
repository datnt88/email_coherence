the first was the graphic (& design tablet), the second is naturally the i tablet. 
but the ipad doesn't incorporate other phone functions (compared to let us say samsung) nor does any i tablets can replace (yet) a pc (personal computer) even ultra portable. 
i should think that the generic term might become the 'itab' (already used for different reasons in various languages) in the near future and eventually ivc[2] (for internet versatile computer [& communication])
