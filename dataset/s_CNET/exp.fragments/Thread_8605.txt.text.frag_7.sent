yes your way did not work. 
sorry. 
i have tried changing the password but changing the password does nothing for me, only when i reset to factory defaults does it get fixed for 2/3 days. 
changing the password it acts up within seconds. 
and i have set it to wep/wpa2/wpa and many other types of encryption it does not make a difference! 
i am looking for solutions again people! 
please help me!
