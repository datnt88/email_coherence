512mb is only of use at very high resolutions (1600x1200 or 1680x1050 or higher) since only at those resolutions will the card's memory usage exceed 256mb. 
(these are the native resolutions of 20&quot; lcds). 
low-end and mid-range cards can't run games well at those resolutions so 512mb is wasted in these cards. 
of the cards i suggested, even the 1950pro probably won't be helped by 512mb. 
that's why the vast majority of these cards only have 256mb while $400 cards typically have 512mb standard. 
the extra money you would spend for 512mb should be invested in a faster card instead. 
here are benchmarks of a midrange x1600pro with 512mb. 
notice that its extra ram never helps it run faster than a x1600xt or x1600pro 'turbo' (both of which have 256mb).
