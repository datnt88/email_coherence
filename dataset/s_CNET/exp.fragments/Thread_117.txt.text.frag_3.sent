i would like to know about the print and photo quality of this printer, as well as the ink cartridge capacity, specifically how many text documents can you print with the ink cartridge before you would need to replace the ink cartridge. 
i would also like to know if this printer is easy to install as this printer is being used alongside my desktop hp slimline computer and my 17 inch lcd monitor. 
thank you.
