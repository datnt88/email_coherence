a few things to check and no one has mentioned it in any posts. 
this card has two - 4 pin power connections on it. 
check to see if both are seated properly or for bad connect. 
these 4 pin connectors must be from a seperate bank or outlet from power supply. 
you cannot use a line splitter to run it. 
this card , when in gaming mode, uses an enormous amount of power hence the 2 4 pin power connectors. 
check the power supply. 
i believe the recommened wattage is 500 watts output. 
this card is a two stage card. 
when it is not doing much graphics it is in low power mode and uses little power but when it has extended graphics such as games it kicks into high power mode or high stage . 
lots of heat is then generated. 
now if you use a splitter or there is a bad connection or the power supply is too small the card will not go into high mode and you will have slow graphics. 
if it detects low power in high mode it will immediately slow down and switch to low mode. 
am not sure but i think if it detects too much heat it will also go to low mode. 
you need to check out this as well as the heat related posts. 
also a bad driver can cause the card not to ramp up to high mode. 
or the card is defect and simplely will not go to the high output mode. 
hope this post helps
