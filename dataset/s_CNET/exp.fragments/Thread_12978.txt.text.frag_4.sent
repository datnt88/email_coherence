when you login, you have an account name. 
that name must have an account in each machine you want to access this machine from. the rules are simple. 
just tell me what step stops you from creating the account. 
and let's repeat this. 
&quot;everyone&quot; is not &quot;anyone.&quot; the difference is worth repeating. 
&quot;everyone&quot; in windows networking is those with an account. 
&quot;anyone&quot; would be those with or without an account.
