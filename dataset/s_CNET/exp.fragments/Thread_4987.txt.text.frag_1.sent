hello, i am currently attempting to build a media center server/pc. 
about 4 years ago i knew my way around a computer and i could easily pick out hardware and put a computer together but now i am a little out of the loop, so any advise would be very helpful. 
i am looking to build a system with 4-6 terabytes of storage (i have a lot of dvds and i only want to rip them once so i intend to use raid to back it up). 
i am going to hook this system up to my tv and i would like to have to ability to play games if i want. 
i also am planning on using windows vista home premium with media center. 
i have spent lots of time finding the right add-ons and making it work just the way i want it to. 
so..... if you have any suggestions on the hardware i should use to build my server i would be very grateful.
