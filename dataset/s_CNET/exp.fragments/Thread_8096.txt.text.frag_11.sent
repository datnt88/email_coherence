don't know. 
not at home pc now. 
how do i check? 
how much ram is recommended? 
when i reseated, the memory stick didn't simply go down and click in. 
i had to click one side, then push down on the other side and click it in. 
based on the instructions, i thought it would just click in. 
i made sure the notch was lined up, but it still wouldn't click in just by applying equal pressure to each side. 
unusual or common?
