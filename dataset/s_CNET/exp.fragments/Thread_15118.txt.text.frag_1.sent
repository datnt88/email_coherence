here is my layout: cable modem to switch switch to both windows server 2003 and wireless router wireless router to all intranet clients at my location (it uses dhcp to assign ip addresses to the intranet clients) this puts my server in front of the firewall for access to the world and all of my other clients behind the wireless routers firewall. 
here is my question: when i connect to my server from my intranet clients, the connections go out to the world and back again to my server. 
i thought a switch was supposed to be smart enough to see the destination and route traffic directly down to the server. 
what i'm after is a way to transfer large files to/from my server at my local network speed (not routing trough my cable modem). 
is there a way to do this without moving my server behind the wireless router's firewall?
