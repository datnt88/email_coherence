although individual experiences vary, let me relate my experiences. 
i have three pcs, the oldest bought nov 1997, it has two 7,200 rpm scsi drives - still going strong. 
i have another pc bought june 2001, it had an 18 gbyte 15,000 rpm scsi drive - it failed. 
i replaced it with a 36 gbyte 15,000 rpm scsi - it failed about a month ago. 
i replaced it with a 160 gbyte ata drive. 
my newest pc bought may 2003, has a 36 gbyte 10,000 rpm scsi drive - still running. 
all pcs are on almost 24/7 it seems, in my case rotation speed is the killer.
