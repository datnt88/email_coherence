just in case you're still interested / care, that cable you linked to on ebay i've seen before.. they are supplied with the matrox dual head cards which allow specific output to tv on the second vga output. 
now, i'm guessing here, but i think what you're seeing with your laptop is the refresh sent to the telly is waay to high which is why it blinks a couple of times then throws it out. 
so, basically you can't use it. 
unless you have a &quot;dual head&quot; laptop which allows you to specify a secondary monitor ? 
-- xp allows this, but win2k doesn't handle some laptops as well (my tecra 9100 for instance). 
so, if you're on xp, check display settings to see if you can configure a &quot;secondary&quot; display for tv, otherwise its a big bulky vga box.. hth.
