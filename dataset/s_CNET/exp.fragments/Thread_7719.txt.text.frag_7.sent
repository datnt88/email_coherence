the fact that it uses rs-232 connection suggest this is an older model and/or discontinued one. 
most newer ups that have links to the system for s/w control are usb based. 
if you google and find such s/w available, it needn't be directly provided for that brand name. 
it *may* work as a generic type setup, it just needs a ups to work. 
so, if you find a newer s/w it *may* work also using a rs-232 to usb adapter then again, once you get into deviated manufacturer setup, it could falter as well.
