i was going to buy an imac so i did plenty of research on it. it comes pre-installed with leopard so that shouldn't be a problem. 
every review i read on the imac raved about its features and ease of use. 
if i were to buy any mac at all it would be the imac. 
what's your budget? the imac is essentially a mainstream system unless you configure it with all top of the line components.
