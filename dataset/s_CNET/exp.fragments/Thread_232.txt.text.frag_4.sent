thanks for the response on hsf and ram. 
since i am not using any video cards, is the psu (550w, three 12 v rails) an overkill for the configuration? 
if yes, is there a way to determine the minimum power supply required to support the machine? 
(assume no external devices attached to the tower except keyboard, mouse)
