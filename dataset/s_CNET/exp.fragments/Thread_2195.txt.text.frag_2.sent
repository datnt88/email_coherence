&quot;bluetooth&quot; = very slow. 
you don't want to know how slow. 
don't even consider this unless you value your time. 
instead look to any wifi solution. 
if you can, try these (shop till you get your price!) links only from now on: (i own 2 of these and i paid the 29 bucks.) (neighbor has this one but i think that average joe/jane may not follow the directions and claim it never works.) more at but i know nothing about them.
