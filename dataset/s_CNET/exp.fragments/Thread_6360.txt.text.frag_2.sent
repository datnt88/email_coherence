they are 2 different categories of cables. 
cat6 has double the bandwidth of cat5 which boils down to a little more reliability. 
you can use either cables with your computer. 
i would recommend cat6 as applications are getting larger and the added bandwidth of a cat6 will accommedate better. 
some good quality cheap cables can be found at good luck.
