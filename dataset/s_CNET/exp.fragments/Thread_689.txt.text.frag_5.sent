under &quot;sending a fax&quot;, step #3: dial a number using your telephone &quot;if you've connected a telephone to the cx9400fax series, dial the number from the phone. 
you see the screen at right. 
select send, then press ok.&quot; add &quot;then press the start button&quot; we are still happy with the print quality and other features (haven't yet printed photos directly from the memory card, though), but it has started to make inky smudges on the top corner of the page. 
they sent me a phone number to call and indicated that the unit would probably have to be replaced, but i haven't yet gotten around to it. 
i don't anticipate any problems, though, since epson seems to have a good track record with their customer service.
