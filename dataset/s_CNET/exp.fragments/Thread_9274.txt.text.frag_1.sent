i have been in the dark ages of technology but recently purchased a dell dimension 3000 series desktop. 
it is the first time i've ever had any experience with a dvd rom drive, so i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong. 
i tried to play a 2-disc dvd set that is supposed to have enhanced computer features. 
when i insert disc 1 everything works correctly. 
it will play the movie like on any dvd player, and it will also pop-up a special dvd rom menu and allow access to the special features on disc 1. however, when i click on most of the special features they tell me i must insert disc 2, which i then do, but the second disc will only play as a regular dvd and will not allow access to any dvd rom features or the dvd rom menu. 
it is extremely frustrating because i have no idea where to even begin to correct this problem, and it seems unlikely that there would be a compatibility issue or need for an upgrade when it will play one disc from the set but not the other. 
but, as i stated, i have no idea about this kind of technology. 
my dvd rom is sony dvd-rom ddu1615 and i'm using interactual player 2.6 i went to the support website for the actual dvd, but it merely informs me that if i'm having trouble accesses the the dvd rom features i will need to install the lastest version of macromedia flash player and have apple quicktime version 6 or above. 
i have all of these components and don't understand the problem
