there are plenty of 3rd party cpu replacement fans. 
just be sure its rated for use with your cpu and it will fit inside the case, sometimes its a tight fit. 
i mention that as some fan and heatsink setups are huge or unique arrangements of sorts. 
check online vendors for sources. 
imho, a few or well placed case fans help greatly and its best to do all this when you're building rather than later. 
heat stress is a killer of gaming pcs.
