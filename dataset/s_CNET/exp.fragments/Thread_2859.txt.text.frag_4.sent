determine the primary s/w pkg. 
you want and then find its requirements. 
using autocad, google for it for results. 
i like to refrain from terms like &quot;powerful&quot; it should be more like &quot;capable&quot;. you don't really need a fast cpu but rather stuffed ram and decent video. 
if the s/w takes advantage of &quot;multiple core cpus&quot; then again, it needn't be the fastest but get one that your mtrbd. 
fully supports, easily. 
as for a mtrbd., pick top-end brands as anything cheap will certainly hurt once the crunching starts. 
of course, be sure the case is well cooled.
