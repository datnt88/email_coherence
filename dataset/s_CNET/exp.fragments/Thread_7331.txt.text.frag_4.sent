and not the usb. 
your usb connection seems to be more consistent with my usb 2. in a sense, that might answer your own question. 
you are operating at usb 2 functionality but your esata is messed up. 
it should be much faster. 
i wonder if you don't suffer from that intel matrix storage manager issue.
