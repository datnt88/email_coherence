one more time...the old battery was worn out it was a 3 volt battery that read .4 volts on a multimeter. the new battery is a 3 volt battery that reads 3 volts. 
prior to replacing the battery the pc would not display anything on the monitor. 
nor it appears that the bios is lost. 
forget the battery !
