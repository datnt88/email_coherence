&quot;i've spent hours adding back programs and personalizing the computer and now it's freezing and disconnecting from the internet.&quot; 
ouch. 
when i read this i thought &quot;ouch.&quot; this means that what you are doing after they fixed your machine has created new issues. 
that is, they may have fixed the machine and whatever you are doing to the machine looks to create new troubles. 
the next time you chat with those that support you, ask what they think of the programs you are installing. 
for example: one owner installed torrent software and every single time their internet connection would start dropping. 
there's a lesson there.
