hello, i'm looking design student looking for a printer, and we often print in sizes only a little bigger than standard letter paper (such as 11x17 tabloid). 
i currently have a basic hp all-in-one printer, but i'm looking to upgrade to a larger one that prints 11x17. 
so then i'm looking for a printer that can print formats as large as 11x17 (larger isn't necessary), and that still has a flatbed scanner/copier (fax not necessary). 
does this even exist?
