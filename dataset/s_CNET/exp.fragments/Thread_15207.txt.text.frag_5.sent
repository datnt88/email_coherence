it's a simple machine. 
i found a nice enough hp d4999t and to keep things quiet i installed a zotac nvidia gt 240 1gb video card which is fanless. 
this runs some intel quad core, 4gb ram and windows 7 pro. 
what was interesting was its speed was below par too at first. 
later i found out by chance when cdburnerxp didn't work on it (it emitted an error message) that with a little google gave me the clue to install some intel storage manager item. 
now it's very nice. 
i don't expect makers to do this for us today. 
we are pretty much on our own but with super tools like search engines to figure it out. 
i know many think that it shouldn't be that way. 
for those i kindly and without any offense intended ask them to go try an apple.
