hey hawk, i did not purchase one until i heard more people that used it. 
i heard it on leo laporte show on am 640 in l.a. and also on his security now podcast. 
this device is like what large companies run but on a smaller scale and user friendly. 
google leo laporte iphantom and you should find his review. 
i am using it and to be honest, it really does work. 
peace of mind is what you are paying for and it does annonymize me. 
they have a 30 day money back guarenty so you have nothing to lose. 
most people knocked it before trying it. 
it did slow my connection about 10% but thats nothing considering i am still pushing 3 mb compared to the useless annonymizer which was barely usable. 
i does not get in the way of any of my programs either. 
to be honest, you forget its there. the tech support is really knows their stuff.
