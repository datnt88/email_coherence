i'm a big hp fan, and my...must be going on 4-5 yrs. 
with my hp deskjet 712c that i use for everyday printing. 
january of this year, i bought a canon i960, that prints absolutely incredible photos. 
epsons are also known for the quality of their photo printers, but the canon has something like a few thousand ink-jet nozzles to spray the ink compared to epson's few hundred nozzles. 
cost in january, 2004- $150. 
price must have come down by now. 
go to a place like circuit city, do some test prints and compare. 
people can't tell my canon photo prints are from a printer. 
for everyday workhorse type of printer, if hp has kept their standards from years before, i like hp; seems like my old hp is going to last forever. 
i find ink prices in general fairly pricey, but i guess it depends on how much you print. 
i still haven't changed any of the ink in the canon from when i bought it- 6 seperate colors. 
but it's not as if i've printed a thousand pictures; a couple of hundred 4x6 at most, but when you get a new printer, they don't give you full ink cartridges, more like 2/3 full according to the staples salesman. 
seems like there's enough ink in there to print another couple hundred.
