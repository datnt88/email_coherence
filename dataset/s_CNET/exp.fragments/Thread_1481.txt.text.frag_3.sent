hi bob, it was just as i thought but but i am grateful for the confirmation. 
as you said it has been altered by seagate for compaq from 20gb to 10gb and i now know its a compaq spare. 
but as it is a good drive and works perfectly i cant comlain to much as i got for 10 after bartering and i only use it as a spare anyway. 
do you think it would be dodgy if i eventually tried to sell it as a 10gb,(bearing in mind buyers would know drive has been altered?)as it is in perfect condition. 
anyway thanks for all your help it was appreciated. 
tom
