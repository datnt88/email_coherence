i have e-x-a-c-t-l-y the same problem and i would like to purchase the same case but in order to not complicate things, i would like to know how can i differentiate if my external hard drive is sata or pata? 
i bought it new around 7 months ago and the only information that the label has is: model maxtor personal storage 3200. 
i know the capacity is 500 gb. 
do you think that if i buy the same case would save my data? 
thanks for your valuable input.
