i am also a dell owner and recently installed an ide in addition to my serial ata. 
i began receiving a similar error but only after powering off the machine. 
a restart would go cleanly so it appeared sporadic. 
you will probably be able to duplicate this after a complete shutdown. 
anyway, i will make a couple assumptions. 
1) you are installing a serial ata in addition to your primary ide hard drive. 
here is how i believe i resolved my issue. 
go into bios - press f2 for setup. 
serial ata will probably say say yes - press the space bar and turn it off. 
you should see the bios request status for two ata drives. 
under your serial ata drive 1 - set it to auto ( so that it will autodetect on bootup.) after rebooting, you should get a message 'new hardware found' shutdown and reboot the system. 
your f1/f2 to continue error should go away because you are forcing your system to recognize the hard drive in question and not confuse it with other. 
if this still doesn't work, a slightly riskier steup would be to set your primary ide drive in bios to auto and make sure all other ide drives (primary/secondary) are set to off. 
here is a link from western digital to look at for checking your jumper settings on your primary ide drive. 
best wishes on resolving this. 
i hope i helped a little.
