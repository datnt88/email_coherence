hello, colleagues and i sometimes have the need to manipulate (fastforward, rewind, etc.) up audio- and video-recordings. is there a device, a pedal, that will allow me to stop, start, rewind, and fastforward audio- and video-recordings without taking my hands off the keyboard? 
i am transcribing interviews, and a pedal that is compatible with realplayer will be useful. the computers involved are of diffent operating systems and models. 
i posed this question to realplayer technical support, and they referred me to cnet. 
thank you, jeffrey lofton [edited by: admin to remove member's phone number--note to jeffrey--it's probably not a good idea to post your phone number in public forum for the world to see.]
