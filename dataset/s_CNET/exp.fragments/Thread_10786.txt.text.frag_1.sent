windows 7 home edition. 
have mouse (without ball) attached; also tried new ergonomic / wireless mouse. 
problem: delayed reaction and / or no response when hovering over links. 
have unplugged mouse, cleaned, re-plugged. 
new wireless mouse has new batteries. 
neither recognizes links and fail to respond most times. 
thanks!
