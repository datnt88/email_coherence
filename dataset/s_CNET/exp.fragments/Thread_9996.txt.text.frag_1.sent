in my device manager under storage controllers, i have an ide controller listed with error message 39 (windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. 
the driver may be corrupted or missing.) i've tried running the driver update but a driver can't be located. 
here's the weird part; i tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling (by scanning for new hardware in device manager) the controller and when it reinstalled, the name of the hardware was completely different from the first time i uninstalled it. 
for example; before uninstall it'll be something like aqxfhyw2 ide controller &amp; after reinstall it'll be a completely different series of random numbers &amp; letters. 
in the properties of the controller, the driver provider, date, version etc. are all unknown. 
anyone ever hear of anything like this? thanks in advance for any help here are my system specs hp pavilion dv5t 1000 cto intel pro core duo 2 2ghz 4gb ram nvidia geforce 9200m gs graphics card windows vista home premium 32bt service pack 2
