bad mouse, bad! if it won't behave, get a new one. 
you didn't mention what type so presume it's the wheel kind. 
sometimes you can feel the crud build up on the inner cylindrical rollers on these and clean them off. 
some have an optical code wheel inside that gets dirt in the slots you can clean...if you take it apart. 
it just depends on how much you love this mouse and don't want to part with it.
