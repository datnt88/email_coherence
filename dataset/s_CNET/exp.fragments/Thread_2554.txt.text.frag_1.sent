i have this card installed on an xp os, and have nothing but problems. the box says &quot;for best ports connection&quot; and it uses an ali chipset, 4 usb's plus firewire. the drivers never seem to install right, i also tried one from another site. 
now the hardware wizard comes up everytime i boot. 
anyone have luck with this card? 
i got this off ebay for a bargain, but that seems not to be now. 
it appeared to work for a bit, but not all devices initially, now it seems useless. 
any help? 
-thanks, russ
