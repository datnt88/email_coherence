that's great i really wanted to get a asus or msi board but they both seemed to have problems. 
i'll be switching my ram to . 
will there eventually be a bios upgrade to fix the ram problem though. 
also would there be anyway to update my bios without using a floppy drive? 
thanks again, you have been very helpful:)
