while each has its advantages and disadvantages, i have had a few friends with older all-in-one printers and scanners that upgraded to windows 7, then couldn't get the scanner to work, no new drivers available. 
in general, that's the problem with any kind of all-in-one product, it limits you when you want to upgrade just one of the all-in-one features, or you toss out the whole unit.
