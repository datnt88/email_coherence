we can't run ethernet and wifi at the same time. 
as to explaining all this i must decline. 
i offer ideas on what i would try along with references to the manual. 
in the faq from the maker the setup should work. 
if not we call it defective and ask for a refund. 
it's that simple. 
if the makers can't get the instructions to the point we can use the products they deserve the returns. 
again, i used their faq and my experience to see if we could find another way to setup. 
it's possible your lan is not on that address range but i would be guessing that. 
by using wifi and no router the extender may be reachable.
