being a part time computer and network tecnician as well as a systems administrator i know very well what piracy is! and yes i also know how dban works, all i wanted to know was an average of how long it takes to function. 
your argument is useless. 
first of all if a person can't afford a car there is always public transport. 
this is not always the case with software!!! i use many open source and freeware programs but there are still certain programs that i need which are neither of these and this is when i turn to piracy! 
(and this is not my will, i only use it because my university insists that i use certain programs!!) secondly.. i did not ask you for any pirated software! 
what i asked is how long a perfectly legal program will take to run. 
as i said your argument is useless. 
well now ill just use dban myself and see how long it takes rather than wasting the rest of my time arguing with you.
