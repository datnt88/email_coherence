in the interest of not repeating the many many posts on the subjects addressed, please take a look at some of the searches below...starting with the one on 'backup'. 
i would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas. the one thing i recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location...whether it be electronic bits and bytes . 
. 
especially an external hdd, or even hard copy. 
once you've explored the many approaches and eliminated those you don't want, you'll probably have a few more questions. 
hoping this helps.
