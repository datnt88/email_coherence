sorry but with the misspellings and typographic errors i can barely guess what the questions are. 
tablets do not substitute for a camera or camcorder. 
but keep in mind that any &quot;app&quot; can be replaced so if the supplied app does not do &quot;steel capture&quot; why would we not look for a replacement for better captures of steel images? 
as of my posting there are 10 more hours on that sale and they were not sold out.
