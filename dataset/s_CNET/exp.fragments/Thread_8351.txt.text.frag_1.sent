i have a hard drive that has been acting funny recently. 
every time i restart the computer, the hard drive partitions erase themselves. 
this first occurred when i restarted for avast update (i was running xp). the computer can see the hard drive, and i am able to reinstall the os (windows 7) and run it. 
i've tried reformatting it twice in the past two days and that hasn't worked. the computer is a custom built and the hard drive is a 750 gb western digital wd7500aads-00l5b1. 
do i need to replace my hard drive, or is there a fix?
