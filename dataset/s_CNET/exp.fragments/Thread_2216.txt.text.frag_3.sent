just moments ago went to dell.com and bought a brand new dell studio xps 435mt built to my specifications with 12gig of ram etc etc. cost me $1900 by the time i got through adding goodies. 
my christmas present to myself. 
ships on december 15th. 
this compaq is swiftly on it's way out the door. 
won't trust anyone sending me a disc from now on! 
said disc just went through shredder. 
problem solved.
