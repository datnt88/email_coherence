as i said, i downloaded and burnt the 93a minime iso. 
and at first, everthing seemed fine. 
i verifed the md5 checksum, then tried a normal boot. 
everything looked fine, but after running through all the setup without visible error, it &quot;booted&quot; into a blank grey screen and sat there doing nothing. 
so i tried booting it into ram with noapci and nolapci (sp?). that did exactly the same thing. 
can you offer any assistance, or should i try getting knoppix instead, or what?
