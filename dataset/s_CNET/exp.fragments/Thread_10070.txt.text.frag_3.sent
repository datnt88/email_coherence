when you have persistant problem(s) on a system you have to step back. 
all too often a common link maybe the psu and/or anything else. 
i usually like to replace the psu as a matter of course. 
while this sometimes corrects the problem it *may* return as it seems yours has and then i see the other half or 2ndary problem, usually the mtrbd. 
or a compotent/device that was stressed during a bad psu or whatever caused the problems. 
another common link is a high level of &quot;heat stress&quot; and that effects everything as well once you have a stuffed system or non-cleaned dust bunnies in there. 
since, you have bad usb ports it could be drivers or mtrbd. 
h/w fault but since you have multiple probelms it really gets hard to t/s w/o some massive swap. 
unstable ac power can also cause weird or unrelated problems in the long run, other than being in the same system.
