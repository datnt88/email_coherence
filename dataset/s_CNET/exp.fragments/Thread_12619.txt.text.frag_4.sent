in another discussion the owner decided to wait about 125 minutes for the files to be worked through. 
it's a bug in windoctor that was never corrected by symantec. 
here's when i first reported it some 4 years ago. 
links about the issue are provided, but if you wait long enough the dialog box finishes and the device will install.
