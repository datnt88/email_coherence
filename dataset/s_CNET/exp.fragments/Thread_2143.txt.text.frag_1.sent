i recently upgraded to a new case and power supply after i switched everything over to the new case on boot i get no video. 
tried multiple screens and different connections still nothing. 
i tried 2 other graphics cards and still nothing. 
then i noticed usb devices were not working . 
even my usb expansion card . 
so a total of 12 usb slots failed. 
i tried changing different mobo connections and it still failed. 
on start up i heard beeping but i fixed that one of my memory sticks went now i don't get anything. 
my fans hd cpu all start up my mobo says its getting power . 
has anyone seen this before and know what to do? 
i'm most likely thinking my mobo died but if any one could help i'd appreciate it
