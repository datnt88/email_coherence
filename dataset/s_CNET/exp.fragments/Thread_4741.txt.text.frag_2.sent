that is very very odd! the last time we encountered such a thing... 1. the case was far too hot. it was cooking the drives. 
2. the power supply was fair too out of spec. 
i've used from 9 dollar to 30 dollar cdrw drives for years now and they do very well. 
at this price i'm very happy as they go past 2 years old. 
my thought here is that something else is wrong.
