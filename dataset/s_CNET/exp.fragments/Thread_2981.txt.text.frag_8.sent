i thank you for the link. 
i seemed perfect but somehow it did not work. 
i did what ray williams in suggested but no go. 
he wrote: i found a fix for this problem. 
like many laptops, mine is equiped with a synaptic's touchpad. 
the touchpad driver override the wheel settings for all mouse devices. 
why? 
i have no idea. 
there isn't a wheel anywhere on my laptop. 
if you are experiencing this problem add the following dword key to you registry: hklm/software/synaptics/syntpenh/allowscrollsettings dword value of 1 after reboot, your mouse wheel settings will no longer be reset. is it possible that the value of '1' which he suggests means one scroll line and therefore i should be setting mine to the number of scroll lines i want? 
in my case 5? m
