i just finished my latest build. 
p5w dh mobo, pent d, asus x1900xtx video card 2gb ram, 2-120g seagate sata drives sony dvd-everything drive floppy, case and 750w thermaltake powersupply plus battery power backup unit 850 watt spent more on the case that usual because i got a full tower with a 350w pwr supply. 
total $850 then the new dell 2407 at $609 this will do everything i want and more. 
i have been building pcs since the mid 80's because i didnt like the price nor the lack of quality in the stuff inside. 
taiwan no name video cards and maxtor hard drives just dont cut it. 
you could build one for less and just as good depending on your requirements. the video card is a high ender as is the 750w power supply and case. 
so i could have done it for about $250 less. 
shop around. 
knock ursef out dude lol ted
