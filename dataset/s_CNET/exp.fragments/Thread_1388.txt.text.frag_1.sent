hi. i do a lot of graphic work on my pc and a lot of the time i'm trying to learn from tut or use photos to do my work by. 
anyway, i heard that you could hook up two monitors to 1 pc and i thought this would really help me out. 
i was hoping someon here might be able to help me figure out what equiptment i would need and how to set things up.
