i dont mind paying anything that is authentic. 
i never have any problems with my credit history or otherwise. 
i knew the rates and i was well aware that i was on roaming. 
and this was not my first experience with roaming and wireless- yes! but the first time when i feel so of the undue excess. 
what i feel though is that- there is some error (software or otherwise)- and my question lies only on the possibility of the existence of such an error on part of the service provider. 
data usage occurs on the kind of usage i am making. 
3g help me open my email faster but i presume does not increase the data usage for that respective email. 
if i am using 20mb daily in usa and then the next day for similar usage i use 200mb in canada.....i dont understand that.
