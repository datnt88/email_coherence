the iphantom does pass your data through remote gateways in order to protect you identity on the internet. 
rob, you're right to say this is necessary for this to happen in order to get that kind of protection. 
i am very happy with the service. 
basically, what you are getting is gateway protection (virus scanning, adware/spyware scanning, network intrusion, etc) for a fraction of the cost. 
on top of this, all of the data between yourself and the gateways is encrypted to protect the information entering and leaving the network. 
even if i were to set up gateway antivirus protection (which is expensive if it works), i wouldn't get the encryption. 
i've talked to the guys there and they are very friendly and helpful. the explained that they are running a lightweight udp protocol and using standard 256-bit aes encryption. the setup was easy and its been working flawlessly. 
sometimes i can't even tell it is there. 
from what i've seen and heard, this company is legit. 
i heard about them from leo. 
i was in the same boat as you rob initially. 
there are a lot of standard firewalls that claim privacy just by using nat (sure you get a private address from nat, but that has nothing to do with privacy on the net). 
however, i am very happy with this device.
