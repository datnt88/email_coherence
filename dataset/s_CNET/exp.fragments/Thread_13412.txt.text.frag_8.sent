if you really want to stop most of the leeches, you will need to create a secured ap that only trusted customers can access with a password. 
most routers are capable of multiple connections, so you can isolate your own network from the publicly accessed one with little problems. the real task will be in managing who you give the password to, and watching your usage to see if you get an out of proportion increase, indicating someone you gave the password to is one of the culprits. 
if that happens, change the password. 
your trusted users will understand. 
you could keep a list of users if you care to.
