ok, i put the 60g drive into the ibm, booted from the xp setup cd, selected the repair feature, selected the drive (c) to repair, but it needs an &quot;administrator password&quot; to continue. 
i tried the one that i use to logon to windows, i tried various others, such as &quot;11111,&quot; &quot;12345,&quot; &quot;00000,&quot; etc. i even tried just hitting &quot;enter&quot; but i can't get past that point. 
so i put the drive back in the sony and thankfully, it still works and here i am! is there a default administrator password, or a way to bypass it somehow? 
i even went into bios and reset the 2 passwords (1 &quot;supervisor,&quot; 1 &quot;user&quot;) that are in there, but that made no difference. 
this is very frustrating!
