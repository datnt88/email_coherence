but since your internet connection is not 18 mbits total and the wifi link is half duplex, all this becomes an exercise of how exact you insist the answer be and if we are talking about laboratory conditions and more. 
under ideal conditions, if the packet sizes are the same, if the response times are stable, the servers that are being fetched are responding on time, all things being perfect. 
remember i lived through the days of battle over the network protocol asynchronous transfer mode (atm) versus tcpip and you are treading right into the argument for atm.
