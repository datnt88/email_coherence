hello, i just recently purchased an olympus d-560 zoom digital camera which came with the camedia master 4.1 software for loading pictures onto your computer. 
well i installed the software and the digital camera would not transfer the images to the computer, even though i had installed the software. 
after uninstalling and re-installing the software several times, i now get the dreaded blue screen error every time i plug in and turn on my digital camera to the computer. 
the error on the blue screen is as follows: file name: usbd (01) + 00000094f error: oe : 0028 : ff07666f this is also what is says when i look at the dvice manager under usb when the software is installed and the camera is plugged into one of the usb ports (the other has my mouse plugged into it): usb: intel(r) 82801ba/bam usb universal host controller1 usb root hub i have no idea what this is about. 
conicidentally the software loaded correctly and pitures load on my girlfriends computer (she has windows me also). 
i'm not sure if i'm in the correct forum, but i would appreciate any help or direction. 
thanks, siva66
