might be best to bite the bullet and just replace the internal cd-dvd. 
re the external...like someone else suggested might try that on another pc. r. proffitt often mentions a registry problem referring to 'upper limits' that might be worth looking at too....there are some of those posts on cnet about that. 
keep us posted how it works out.
