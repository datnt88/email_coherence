you're right, dvd's are probably the best way to do it - even if it takes more effort. is there a really easy way to do it, other than the manual way? 
are dvd's trust worthy for not failing - i've heard rumors that as they get older than can fail? 
also can you use sd cards - has anyone tried this? 
thanks for you're help!
