on the back of the box it says iso-9001 on the bottom left.. and on the front of the manual is a sticker under the k7s5a that says ea=000795b22c56 and in the manual introductions it says : socket a support for an amd k7 type processors, and you can install any one of these processors on the board. 
the mainboard supports front side bus speeds of 200/266 mhz. 
beyond this i cant seem to find a model # or anything else...
