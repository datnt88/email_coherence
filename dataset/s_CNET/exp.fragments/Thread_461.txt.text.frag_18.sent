i have owned many, many ink jet printers, including canon (favorite), brother, epson, compaq, hp, and lexmark. 
i always replenish my supply with generic ink. 
i order from a couple of on-line sources, and the quality of the ink matches brand name. 
i have never had problems with the ink destroying my printers. 
consider, however, that not all inks are the same. 
once, i purchased ink from the shelves of a local discount store at an unbelievably low price. the results were unbelievable too. 
colored water doesn't work.
