cool information. 
as far as caring for my discs goes, i pretty much have that down. 
it's usually been during the initial burning process that the duds have revealed themselves (which is a fortunate thing). 
i was rather surprised the first time i had a sony fail me, and even more so when the film in another one disintegrated near the center! 
never, before taking computer science 11, had i known of such a floppy. 
among the nostalgia our instructor had to show us were a reel, a rather cumbersome-looking 40 mb hard drive (i can't remember whether it had four platters or eight), and a 9&quot; floppy that held 128 bytes! 
not kilobytes, bytes!!! :s
