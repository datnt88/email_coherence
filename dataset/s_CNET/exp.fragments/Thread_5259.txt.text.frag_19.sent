&quot;from there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere!&quot; &#8212; dr. seuss glad you checked &quot;everywhere.&quot; the big clue was the symptom. 
it only is the symptom but never tells us where. 
good sleuthing on your part too. 
many will never believe how bad this plague is.
