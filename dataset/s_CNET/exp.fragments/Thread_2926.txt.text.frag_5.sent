i bought this keyboard with a piano teaching software for about $200 from a company called &quot;jump music&quot;. 
so this keyboard doesn't have a model number. 
if you wanna see a pic of it, here it is. it runs entirely thru the 15 pins cable which should be connected to the 15 pins joystick port on an old version of computer.
