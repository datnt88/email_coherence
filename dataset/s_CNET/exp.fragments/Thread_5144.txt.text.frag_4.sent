i went into bios and one of the advanced features did allow me to select the hard drive i want to boot to (vista) and it worked great! 
this allows me to have the best of both vista and xp with my d drive being able to boot to xp with a simple bios switch. 
i realize or think i heard somewhere that it's possible to have a menu come up in the boot process that does the same thing. 
from what i've seen so far, i would highly recommend that anyone who has a 2nd hard drive and wants to try vista, to do the same thing. 
if nothing else, this allows me to still use my epson scanner ans vista will not run the scanner and from the epson website, they seem to indicate they have no plans on writing a vista driver for my scanner.
