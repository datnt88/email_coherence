i have had this pent iv two years. 
the generic cd-rw will read but will not burn a cd after working before. 
i have uninstalled and installed. 
i have tried using nero and microsoft burners. 
nero creates a virtual image while media player just says it cant burn file. 
i disconnected and reconnected cables. 
any suggestions or has the burner gone bad after two years?
