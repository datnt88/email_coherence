i have always used wireless. 
just 2 weeks ago i was downloading at a constant 120 kb/s. 
10 days ago i installed a video card but i left the network card untouched, but after that the card has been acting weird. 
i download at speed from 8-12kb/s which is very depressing. 
help would be appreciated.thanks!
