the odd start issues are traced to the usual items. 
i'll let you do more research on the first with google. 
1. bad caps. 
2. if it worked before (you didn't tell) then my first thought is an old psu or item 1. but to fix this we pop in a new motherboard. 
there are some owners that want it to be software but at boot time, windows and drivers are not loaded so it's not software. 
if something tinkered with the bios that's easy too. 
load the defaults and try again but the age of the board and system tells me it's item 1, psu or just old gear.
