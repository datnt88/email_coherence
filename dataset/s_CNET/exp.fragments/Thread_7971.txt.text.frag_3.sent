the printer when active usually sits at the ready unless as you know goes into a &quot;hibernate mode&quot; or simply parks itself. 
this action allows it to &quot;cap&quot; the printhead in order to lessen any drying of the printhead. 
if your printer doesn't do this then it exposes the prthd. 
and starts to dry out. 
when turned-off it will park and come to rest on the capping mechanism preventing drying. 
again, if it can't do this it wull cause problems fo especially inkjets, less so for any other typical home printer. 
i exclude power and electrical issues.
