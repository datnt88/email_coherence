as for specs, right now i've 768megs ram, 20 free gigs of space and, according to hp my motherboard is asus a7n8x-la. 
it seems i wasn't quite as in the dark as i thought i was - simply took some looking up of the new terminology - like light scribe which seems pretty dandy. 
i'm seeing things about ide/eide/sata which seem to be the connection/cable type. is there a certain type i would only be able to use? 
my current drives use ide (which, according to some is really eide?) but would i be able to use sata or eide if i found a writer i liked better with those options? the ones i am looking at right now are lite-on, hp, lg or asus. 
i've been checking out reviews from a certain competitor site. the pricing is actually much more reasonable than i expected! 
i'm not entirely sure by what you mean with 'set the jumpers.'
