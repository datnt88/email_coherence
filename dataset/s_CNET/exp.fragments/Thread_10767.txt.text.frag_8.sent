i shoulda mentioned not to mess w/ the domain name in my last post, i apologize for that. 
unfortuneatly i do not know how you can set this up having your laptop on a domain. 
the it people at your school may be able to tell you how to make the shared folder accessable to your laptop (most likely it is due to a setting on your laptop). 
good luck!
