good day, i have the t6524 and have the power supply that came with the system....doing reasearch it seems that the high end cards require more power depending if your running two cards at the same time (sli) according to the emachines live chat the pny 7600gs has a compatibility issues with emachines and suggested i try another brand....so now i'm trying to decide to get a 512mb or a 256mb card.
