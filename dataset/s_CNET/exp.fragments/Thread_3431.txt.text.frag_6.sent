no, the powersupply was fine. 
i think it has a 400w supply? 
not sure tho. 
i was a little dissapointed tho, i was trying it out with doom 3 and it ran ok at the highest settings, but there were still a few little hiccups. 
i had to set it back to the second highest to get really smooth performance (which still looks really good). 
tho i'm told that ati's cards aren't the best for doom 3. i'm running wow too and its good at the highest settings but not perfect - the camera stutters every now and then, but just for a second. 
wow also says it runs best on nvidia cards tho... its a decent little machine, but it is not a powerhouse. 
but at the price, i'm happy with it. 
i also had a problem with the sound card, but it so far is fixed just by turning off all the stuff in the start menu cept for norton av and bigfix (the emachines update software that still doesn't have the latest drivers for the dvd drive).
