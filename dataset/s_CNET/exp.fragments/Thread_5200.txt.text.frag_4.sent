the concept won't advance for a while and until then, i will need a drive. 
and it's not that 1.6 or 1.8 is too slow for leopard - it isn't, it's just that the air has poor cooling of its peripheral components which also affects the cpu's ability to cool itself. 
the shell itself doesn't get anywhere near as hot as the crudbooks / pros, but like almost everything apple i've encountered since '06, it is designers pushing the entire production process and not the engineers. 
the result is that when i stack up my 1.33ulv vista-based ssd notebooks against the air, the vista notebooks in many situations are faster (yes, even with glass on). 
and that's pathetic, since the air has none of the versatility of the ulv machines - no docking station, no ports, no crucial wireless connectivity even, and even what's built in - 802.11 / bluetooth - sucks in comparison to comparable portables. 
in case you're not clear, nothing in the air is too small for current technology. 
it may be too small for apple to accomplish without problems but that's a different - and typically apple - matter. 
although the air has been purpose-designed it is not an ultraportable in the vein of the sony tz or even the x300. 
it is more a macbook that has been stripped of everything in order to make it supposedly compete with the likes of the sony and lenovo. the air may fit into an envelope but in reality it pushes no envelopes apart from that of marketing. 
in terms of actual build quality - i.e. how it stands up to everyday use, not just fit & finish - it is somewhat worthless unlike the x300 or the tz for example. 
apple knows that a sexy skin will sell whatever crap they've put inside to the majority of the great unwashed who don't know better. the only reason i still have it, as i might have mentioned before is that i would like to run os x on something that i can actually carry. 
however it is a monumentally rubbish - and i will also admit monumentally pretty - lightweight notebook.
