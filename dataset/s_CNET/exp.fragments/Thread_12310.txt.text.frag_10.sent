after dealing with a few hundred setups, you have a defect somewhere. 
it's not evident exactly where but i notice you didn't reply about p2p use and scans/repairs. 
that is a common problem area. 
what is &quot;it&quot;? 
sorry, the clues aren't here in these posts. 
but it's likely to be what's common to all the setups. 
here's a test i use. 
i take a balky laptop to a local free hotspot and try it there. 
sometimes it reveals there is an issue with the laptop. 
sometimes i find a &quot;duh&quot; item like the laptop maker didn't plug in the antenna.
