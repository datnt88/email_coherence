i have something else for you to check, if it only reboots when you use the slot video card, it can be heating inside cabinet, why?, your added video card can generate much more hot air inside your computer because it has its own memory & probably it's also working much faster than the integrated one, try using your machine wide open & check if it stays working or if it works more time compared to when i'ts, cabinet closed, if it does you have to make your computer cooler adding fans to it.
