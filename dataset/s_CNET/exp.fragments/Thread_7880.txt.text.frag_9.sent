thanks mrmacfixit, i did not know the thing about the ram in macbook. 
i think that the config that has been recommended is best for you. 
do not go for the black macbook unless you want it. 
it costs $200 more only for the color. the design and quality are the same. 
an small external hdd would be a good idea, depending on your needs.
