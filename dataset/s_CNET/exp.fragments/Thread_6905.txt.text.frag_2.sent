i don't see where your computer's makers drivers were installed. 
microsoft doesn't find them (again proper!) and nothing has changed in decades about this installation. 
let me be blunt. 
no drivers = no access. 
bob ps. your post doesn't tell of make or models so it appears you are not asking for help finding the drivers but just wanted to know why this is.
