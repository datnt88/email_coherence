the lap top was able to dedect the network. 
that is good. 
if i have not misunderstood you, for the network id, try entering ''default'' (without the quotes). 
if that does not work, then you need to go into the gateway of the router via its ip address . 
etc. (supplied), then look in, e.g. the wireless section for the network id (ssid)-where to look depends on the make/model of the router. 
note that this id can be changed. the gateway address can also be found by run&gt;cmd--&gt;ipconfig /all. 
furhter note that it seems that the ''ssid broadcast'' at the router may have been turned off,(actually wise to do so) as otherwise, your laptop should have been able to connect automatically once it has detect the network. 
further note that it may be better to disable the bluetooth if it is not needed. 
(if the above works, please send the $50.00 to your favorite charity ! )
