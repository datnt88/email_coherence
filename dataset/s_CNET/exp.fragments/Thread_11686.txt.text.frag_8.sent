hello again again bob. the psu should be able to cover all the needs in this system, i am of cause not a 100% sure of this, but i ran the &quot;self-test&quot;(a button to test if the psu works as it should). 
it should have enough power to run this system. 
also the cooling seems very fine, when the graphicscard fails(if it even is the graphicscard) and shutsdown the tempature is about 60-65 degrees, which is really not that hot. the rest of the system runs very cooled too, i've bought the corsair h100i for the cpu, so it runs at around 50 degrees at full load (when idle about 35-40) so as you can see none of these should be the problem, unless its the sensor on the fans/card that fails at 60+ degrees, i have got no idea if that could even be the case, but i start thinking of all these scenarious. 
i'll try and put the card in the other pci-e slot and see if this helps thanks in advance.
