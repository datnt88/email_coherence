i am from the old school of hp and computer repair. 
i have several sets of hard drive recovery disc from hp, compaq, dell, acer and several other companies. 
(these all came with the computers). 
all of these will re-image a drive. 
even the asain drives that you can buy. 
first time i have used the recovery disc from the d: partion to replace a drive. 
i just gave that a shot, but i did not want anyone else buying their recovery kit which should image any drive as long as it is in the oem machine.
