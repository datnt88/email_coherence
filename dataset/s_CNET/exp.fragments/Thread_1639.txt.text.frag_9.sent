today we have more choices and each has speeds matching the connections but we have usb , firewire, ethernet, wifi and what else? since even a simple server could autosync these i'll share i tried that and now have settled to a netbook as a server. 
i tried various computers over the years but most would draw 100+ watts. 
today i have a simple netbook and it runs under 10 watts after the screen goes out. 
how do i know? 
i put it on a watt meter. 
so here's my home grown solution. 
a netbook with a big for today 1.5tb usb hard drive over wifi and in a remote place of the house then syncback to that from the work machine.
