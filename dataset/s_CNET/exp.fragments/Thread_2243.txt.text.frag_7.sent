my old lexmark printer needed a new cartridge after several years of sitting in an unheated summer cabin in mn. a new black cartridge costs about $30. i bought a &quot;nib factory sealed lexmark z715 photo ink jet printer&quot; on ebay for $12.50 plus $14.75 s&h. it was new with two unopened cartridges, black and color. the seller got it free with a new computer and didn't need it.
