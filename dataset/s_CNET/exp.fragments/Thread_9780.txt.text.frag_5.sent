they go beyond the simple repair i noted. 
they can even remove the flash memory chip and put it on another board. 
then if there is file system damage they can recover that too. 
when you can't lose it, they are to go to people. the highest price we paid was about 24,000 for recovering novell drives. 
long story about an it that believed that raid meant that backup was not necessary since raid could recover from drive loss. 
backup copies are always cheaper.
