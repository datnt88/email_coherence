i mention this as i felt it was something else...and maybe worth passing it on. 
\\\\ i just had a monitor(crt) bite the dust. 
however, before i did the fix, i went in another direction. 
i had thought the video card failed, but it appeared ok. the monitor itself shown a &quot;green led&quot; saying it had a signal but no display. 
after a few minutes, i got the whiff of a burnt component, which then appeared to be the psu as i usually suspect. 
but, the system was up and running and the smell did suggest that, but it seems the monitor itself had blown. 
i swapped it and all is ok. fyi - the compaq 17in. 
monitor was made in 1995, so i got my money's worth. 
it was a used monitor and i had it for at least 5yrs. 
or slightly more. 
strange to me, the monitor was made in finland, i never noticed that.
