hey bob, thnx for your reply, but somebody told me that i can skip the wi fi router (thats the last option for me) but do tell me how can i disable the dhcp server as wireless connection auto assigns an address... there are three things which are conflicting my routers dhcp server my windows dhcp server my dlink's dhcp server so i need a setup to do something about these conflicts moreover if i disable my dhcp server, windows does not read my external ip address and set it on local area connection as provided my router everything is so confusing to me please help !
